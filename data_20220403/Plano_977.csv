"Even before talking to a travel agent. Talk to yourself: ‚ÄúSelf, do I want to chill at an all-inclusive resort? Do I want to do the tourist rounds? Do I crave adventure?‚Äù 

Me I can‚Äôt think of a worse vacation than being jailed in an all-inclusive resort. But I have many friends who think they are the greatest thing ever. I don‚Äôt know you, your demographics, your travel companions, your tolerance for imperfection, your length of stay, or your $$$. I just hope you‚Äôre self-aware enough figure out a base itinerary. If you have more $$$ than time, use a travel agent. If you have more time than $$$ everything you need is on the internet. 

I happen to be more on the adventurous side. My trip to the Big Island included riding the circumference of the island on a motorcycle plus a trip over ‚Äúthe saddle‚Äù and up to the summit of Mauna Kea and the observatory on Mauna Loa. 

I‚Äôm hoping the üá∫üá¶-üá∑üá∫ War ends with a decisive üá∫üá¶ victory that causes üá∑üá∫ to stop sowing chaos around the globe so I can take a motorcycle tour across North Africa (thanks to üá∑üá∫ Chaos neither Libya nor Syria are currently enterable) around 2028. But that‚Äôs me. 

I‚Äôm normally good with winging it, but I was in Iceland with my teenager a few Christmases ago, and I knew to plan meals around major holidays.

"For a first trip to Hawaii, you need to pick an island: Oahu, Maui, or the Big Island. There are other islands, but they aren‚Äôt for first timers. 

1. Oahu: This is where the capital Honolulu is. It‚Äôs Pearl Harbor, Waikiki beach, hiking at Diamond Head, the film studio at Kualoa Ranch: Jurassic Park, Waterworld, Kong: Skull Island, LOST, Hobbs & Shaw, Hawaii Five-0 (& Five-O), Magnum P.I., etc. Honolulu is a big city and has all the amenities of a big city (museums, sports, restaurants, etc). 

2. Maui: If you‚Äôre not adventurous and just want to chill on the beach, stay at one of the all-inclusive resorts on the west side. For the adventurous get an AirBnB in Kihei. Learn to surf. Swim with turtles. Take the road to divorce, err Hana Hwy (it‚Äôs a one lane road with two-way traffic, my wife had to do it because she saw the ‚Äúroad to divorce‚Äù review on Trip Advisor). Watch the sunrise from the summit of Haleakala (it‚Äôs a National Park). Bike down Haleakala. (PS even in June temps at the summit of Haleakala are in the 40s dress appropriately). Go Zip-lining. Visit the beaches (the beaches on each side of the island are way different than the other sides). See a blow hole. 

3. The Big Island: Hawai‚Äôi is all about the volcanoes. If you go to the big island and don‚Äôt take a pre-dawn hike to see Halema ªuma ªu Crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, you wasted your trip. See waterfalls, visit all the scenic screensavers on your AppleTV. Visit the petroglyphs on Chain of Craters Rd, the coffee plantations above Kona, the Macadamia nuts farms above Hilo, or the ancient settlements at Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park. Drive to the southernmost point of the USA at Ka Le or make the greatest elevation change you can do in a single day by going from sea level to the summit of Mauna Kea (like Haleakala it‚Äôs ü•∂ at the summit all year round). Note that Hilo is the wettest spot in America whereas the west side north of Kona is a desert. 

Enjoy the food. Tuna and Mahi Mahi are local. Most other fish is imported. Experience fresh Poke. 

The cheapest time to visit Hawaii is between Easter and when school lets out in early June. The most expensive time is Christmas-New Years. In the winter it can, and does, snow on the summits of Haleakala, Mauna Kea, and Mauna Loa. 

PS stay on Texas Time. DO NOT ADJUST TO LOCAL TIME. You will get far more out of your trip if you wake up at 3a-4a and start your adventures at sunrise. 

PPS all beaches in Hawaii on all islands are rocky. Even super tourist beaches like Waikiki.

"I used to have ""analysis paralysis"" and would feel that there was no way possible for me to plan the *perfect* trip when I don't know much.

EDIT: I have found that if you ask people who have been to the country you are visiting, they are always willing to share information -- it is essentially telling you about *their* trip and in some ways they get to relive it through telling you about it. So -- don't be afraid to ask other people about their travels.  EDIT2: case in point is u/bachir_22 comment :-)

"Shocked by how unwelcoming and unhelpful some of these comments are lol.

You can Uber everywhere for sure, might be a bit expensive when you're ubering from Plano to Dallas but if it gives you ease of mind why not.

Definitely come down to Dallas there's a ton to see/eat/do down here.  There's a strong group of people who never leave the burbs and don't really know whats going on in Dallas beyond disaster shit they hear on the news.  In fact it's just like family I have in the NYC burbs.  They're legit too afraid to go into the city nowadays - I still hit the city every time I visit and I never had any issues.

Things to see near Plano

- the shops at legacy east and west

- Frisco Star - cowboys practice stadium is here

- there's one or two nature preserves in the Plano/Frisco area, drawing blanks on the names though

- if you haven't been to a mall in TX they're monsters.  Near Plano there's Stonebriar otherwise in Dallas check out North Park.  It's like a mall x art gallery

Things to do in Dallas

- walk Margaret hunt Hill bridge, grab some food or beers at Trinity groves. They have a new beer garden there but I haven't checked it out

- grab food/drink in bishop arts while you're over there.  Manhattan Project is a pretty good brewery near there with a decent little patio

- cidercade if you're into that type of thing

- klyde warren park, it's food trucks, and tons of art museums nearby that are all walkable

- deep ellum if you want to check out some music in an evening

- truckyard on lower Greenville is a staple ""yeah I'm in tx"" vibe for people not from here.  Once again food and drinks.  There's some little stores and such on Greenville Ave as well

- outdoorsie, walk or rent a bike and cruise around white rock lake.  The botanical gardens are near white rock and one of the few outdoor attractions with some beauty

- sixth floor museum if you're into history

- catch a performance at one of the big music halls

- get some tacos for sure.  El come, banqueta, la Ventana are all solid

- oak lawn has some awesome parks and also has a huge LGBTQ scene with some super famous gay bars like Roundup

- walk the Katy trail, stop at either Katy trail ice house, walk north to Knox/Henderson, or go all the way south to near American Airlines center

If you want to see some actual Texas vibes go to fort worth and go to / near the stockyards.  Real cowboys and stuff 

Some people enjoy the standup at the Addison improv but I haven't checked it out yet.  Addison circle might have an event going on when you're here so check that out too

Overall DFW like anywhere else has pros and cons, but there's plenty to do and see for those who care to leave their homes.  Car centric city but just Uber if you don't want to drive.  Good luck and you're welcome here if you dig it.

"You may have heard this from others, but I'll try to share additional details. Depending on the airport you fly into, you'll be either right in the middle of DFW or you'll be in downtown Dallas. The only true way to get you from either airport to Plano where your hotel might be are major highways. So, I recommend taking an uber to Plano and then immediately go to a rental car place in Plano. Once you're in the suburb area, you can easily avoid highways wherever you need to go within Plano and the surrounding suburb towns with ease (just a slight increase in time, but not bad at all). Most roads max at 45 mph, with Preston going up to 55 mph, but overall, the roads are fairly easy to drive on without the crazy Texas highway drivers. Just note intersections of two roads may have a dip/bump in the road. This is on purpose to slow traffic going through the intersection, so don't freak out if you hit it too fast since it's hard to see until you're right on it.



As someone living in the DFW area close to Plano, you can enjoy life without really going into Dallas much (unless you really want to hit up the bars in Uptown or Deep Ellum). I spend most of my time between the various suburb cities because they have so much to do- malls, parks, good food (and variety of it), some small/casual bars, gyms, etc etc.



Now, going to Dallas, you can very easily drive to the parking lot of the DART station in Plano and take the DART train. It will take around 1hr to get downtown, which is about what it would take you driving while avoiding highways (or during rush hour traffic). It'll be less stressful on the train and you can see the area around you while riding. You're from NYC, so I think you already know to be careful of the sketchy stuff/people/late night times, especially if you're travelling alone. Once downtown, you either stay in a specific area (Deep Ellum, etc) or use an uber to travel to other areas of Dallas.

"Fact is, the ppl moving infrastructure in NYC & most large northeast cities was built at a different time & for diff reasons- 

DFW metro was designed for car drivin' (or truck & SUV lol). w/ public transport kinda as an afterthought & a concession for low income commuters. It's ok-ish for getting to work & back if you don't have a car & assuming you work daytime hours. & def *can* be useful, but I recommend planning & budgeting ahead for Uber for nightlife, traveling between train stops & points of interest, & to maximize what you can do & see while exploring the city. It ain't no NYC, but it's a fantastic city! But it's comical how shits so spread out.
& zoning is vastly different from NYC, Chicago, all of New England. 

But within Dallas proper, It's an all or nothing kinda design.

Like....
>HERE< go allll the houses, & none shopping/dining/pubs/culture/entertainment (just gas station, Starbucks & commercial restaurants)
& then WAYYYY over...
>HERE< go all the nightlife & pub food
& little ways off down
>THERE< go all the boutique shopping, salons, vintage shops..
& across town over 
>HERE< go all the arts which isn't really THAT far from 
>THERE< where the historical district is (which please forgive us we were born late in the timeline of Amercan History)
& it's actually not a long walk from there to Deep Ellum but to do that, one must pass through the lawless underbelly of no-mans-land- which I highly advise against unless you've maybe been to the penitentiary before & know how to handle that kinda scene.
But there are very few areas that mix multiple facets of the city in an area small enough or close enough to navigate without a 10-20 min car ride, 30-40 minute bus ride, or 45-60 min walk.
Central downtown Dallas prob does it best.

Oh & JFK 
Oh... sports..
Those happen about 40 mins outside of the city next to the *one* legit Amusement Park within 200 miles- also there is nothing else put there unless you like Cheddars.

& some places- particularly nightlife districts, are just dumb to even try to drive in during peak hours. & you may end up never getting to have any fun bc you may never find a place to park.
& oh, btw, the trains & busses don't accommodate the entertainment districts or the nightlife hours at all.

But I tell ya what..
I fuckin' love this place!!

">Metabolism is such a tiny factor in how your body reacts to calorie intake.

Yeah, *no*. Thyroid and metabolic status are *critical*, as is Vitamin D. VLC/Keto/Vegan folks all end up in the same place eventually‚Ä¶crashed metabolism.

@ OP I suggest you see a PCP and get labs (CMP, CBC, thyroid, vit. D, B12, etc.). Also, track your body temps and pulse at waking, 30 min after breakfast (you need to eat breakfast) and in the afternoon. Your temp should be 97.8-98.2 at waking and hit 98.6+ after breakfast and stay there all day until after sunset/evening. Look at some of Ray Peat's ideas with regard to thyroid, metabolism, diet, supplements, light exposure, stress and sleep *before* too much cardio. You could consult BiochemNordic (not affiliated) or similar for guidance. Build muscle with functional and compound bodyweight movements/conditioning. That in itself  provides sufficient cardio.

"My suggestions:

See an immunologist about food and other allergies. Inflammation can arise from various factors.  

Based on that or before do an elimination diet - starting with all sugars and simple carbs.  Breads and wheat products can also produce these symptoms and cause more inflammation making proper nutrition harder to get despite what you eat.  

Exercise - you CANT out exercise a bad diet.  Focus on what goes in more.  Cut back on the cardio - this may be causing some other inflammation.  Do some sprints, maybe up hills.  Get a trainer if needed to guide  you.  This will drop weight faster almost every time than cardio.  

Don't believe all the hype on calories in/out ""it's just simple to cut calories to lose weight"".  If that were true you would not be asking for help.  If everything else was in perfect order, a small reduction in calories vs needs would produce some weight change.  Cutting too much will also have the adverse effect of hanging on to the weight.  Sometimes, eating MORE of the RIGHT foods is what you need.  Right foods being the key.  Eating the wrong stuff (garbage/sugary foods) provides CALORIES, but NOT NUTRITION.  So your body will still suffer and want you to eat MORE.  So it's NOT just about the calories.  The nutrition and makeup is far more important.  Try this simple change - eliminate anything WHITE from your diet (or can be white) and eat only one ingredient foods where possible.  If it has a label showing more than 1-3 or so simple ingredients (not WHITE) then it's good.  So no sugar, no flour or flour products, no pasta, no rice, etc.  Do that with a cheat day one day a week if needed.  This is paraphrasing the Tim Ferris Slo-Carb diet from 2010 or so - 4 Hour Body.  It helped me drop over 30 pounds in less than four months one time.

"I might suggest something a little different than what I've seen here already: maybe try finding an internist? Just to rule out anything medical.

I used to work for one and (imo) they are a special, wonderful kind of doctor... *especially* for women of this particular age range. In fact the VAAAAST majority of my employer's patients were women just like you. 

Im sure there are ""formal"" definitions for what the ""internal medicine"" specialty actually IS... but informally, what I saw is that internists seem to be particularly well trained in looking *thoroughly* at a person's WHOLE life/health/family situation, and thinking of ""out of the box"" connections that maybe other doctors haven't considered. 

From my own experience working for one (as well as from others I have talked to who have seen internists as patients) they seem to take WAY more time with their patients than your average doc does. (They're a specialist, after all.)

The doctor I worked for *regularly* found very basic conditions other docs had missed, simply by taking patients at their word & ordering tests other docs considered ""pointless."" Like she found MS, thyroid issues, autoimmune conditions like sjogrens... etc etc... and completely turned peoples lives around for the better.

"I did a half marathon distance for training a few weeks ago, and my go to start point is at Windhaven Meadows Park at Spring Creek and Windhaven.

At the park there is an inner and outer (larger) loop. I start and end the run with a lap of the larger loop, which is about 3/4 of a mile, if memory serves. From there, you can take the Legacy Trail north which passes underneath all the roads for several miles, you go underneath McDermott, and then it loops around and ends back at McDermott where you can continue south on the Preston Ridge Trail. That trail does have level street crossings, but if you're doing an out and back, you don't have to go too far south - I turned around just after Hedgecoxe.

From the park, the first opportunity for water is almost 3 miles in, so you may want to bring your own during hot months.

I do like Arbor Hills because the elevation changes challenge me. However, it gets very busy and weaving in and out of large groups, tripping over dog leashes, and competing for space with people taking the whole trail for photography, gets pretty annoying.

"I don't know what the pricing is now, but I used to live at Landmark at Gleneagles off of Frankford and the Tollway- I moved out last year.

I had a large two bedroom apartment (about 1100sq ft) for a little over $1400/mo. It's not super stellar and it's an older apartment, but they treated me well while I was there. I doubt you'll get that price exactly but it might still be cheaper than things you'd find around Legacy and such.

I'm also sure it's quite a bit further south than you'd want but most of Plano, Richardson (I work with a company based in Richardson), and Carrollton were all in easy reach and part of my regular routines in that area.

Pricing also may have gone up more than I'd expect, because they were hit hard after the winter storm and did some upgrades to a number of units in the process, too.",t2_aqrq7,omgfloofy,0,1648572995.0,0,t1_i2l3f64,i2l3f64,True,cusinbs94,t3_tqxhyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/plano/comments/tqxhyf/any_recommendation_for_an_apartment_2_people_in/,Any recommendation for an apartment (2 people) in the range of $1400,/r/plano/comments/tqxhyf/any_recommendation_for_an_apartment_2_people_in/i2l3f64/,0,r/plano,0,0

"Texas actually has laws/rules about burning.

As far as firepits, etc., these are addressed

> Fires for Recreation, Ceremonies,  Cooking, or Warmth Outdoor burning is allowed when used solely for recreational or ceremonial purposes, in the noncommercial preparation of food, or exclusively as a means of generating warmth in cold weather. In other words, campfires, bonfires, and cooking fires are allowed. Fires built under this exception may not contain electrical insulation, treated lumber (including paint, stain, varnish, clear coat, or any other kind of treatment), plastics, construction or demolition materials not made of wood, heavy oils, asphaltic materials, potentially explosive materials, chemical wastes, or items containing natural or synthetic rubber. The other general requirements on allowable outdoor burning do not apply to fires covered by this exception, but the burning must not cause a nuisance or traffic hazard. 
May I cook food on my charcoal  grill in my backyard? Yes. Fires used in the noncommercial preparation of food are allowed. 
May I build a fire in my fireplace? Yes. Indoor fres are not regulated by the Outdoor Burning Rule. Domestic-use freplaces are authorized under the TCEQ‚Äôs de minimis rules in 30 TAC 116.119. Are campfires allowed inside the city limits? Fires used solely for recreation or ceremony are allowed by state law; however, local ordinance may prohibit this kind of burning. Make sure no oils, asphalt, synthetic rubber, or other materials that produce heavy smoke are in the fire: they could release toxic gases or cause a nuisance or traffic hazard.

"One of my friends kids is also VERY introverted.  She tried jujitsu and now loves it.  Goes to the Dojo 2-3 times a week.  It's a great workout  teaches self defense, builds confidence, and is a good community.

A kid from a childcare I used to work at was learning jujitsu (pre-covid) and she wanted to show me what she was learning.  She's a slightly bigger than average 8 year old and I'm a 6ft 275lb male that was about 27.

She tells me to pretend like I'm going to grab her so I do that.  She side steps me and kicks the back of my knee in.  I drop to a knee and that's followed by a punch to the throat.

The path is about 8 miles, is along roads but only crosses 3, and does so at lights. It's mostly nature- or at least undeveloped property-adjacent and is a lot more pleasant than running through residential streets.

From Arbor Hills, you can go west along Parker but the north side of the street lacks sidewalks in one stretch and is unnecessarily dangerous for pedestrians, in typical Plano fashion. However, if you weather the danger, run Parker to Plano Parkway and take that north, that's an extra mile or so.

"I always run the [Preston Ridge Trail](https://www.plano.gov/1486/Preston-Ridge-Trail) (green belt) that goes north and south between Ohio and Coit. From one end to the other and back, it's a half marathon but you do have to cross 5 major intersections and probably about 15 minor streets each way. However you have so much visibility that you aren't having to stop last minute when you spot a car. I personally run really late at night so there's not as many cars on the road but if I see cars coming I just run on the sidewalk adjacent to the street towards the cars until they pass and then cross. But that trail is like perfect for me, the path is like 10 feet wide, has soft rolling inclines and declines, dedicated & marked intersections to cross the street, and you don't need to worry about uneven sidewalk, branches, or dirt on the path.

However the [Chisholm Trail](https://www.plano.gov/1451/Chisholm-Trail) that goes NW to SE goes is 11 miles (from end to end and back) which I am pretty sure only crosses 1 major intersection and the rest of the time the trail actually goes underneath the roadways at the major intersections.

"Plano has quite a few options in that income range. West Plano is the wealthiest area of the city while farther north or west near Carrolton/Allen/McKinney for newer builds. You could also buy some land out East Plano by Parker and build a custom home if you don't mind a slightly farther commute and waiting for construction to complete. It all really depends on your priorities.

Personally, I recommend moving as close to work as possible and finding a home that's well maintained. I've toured homes with leaky roofs, mold, foundation issues, broken plumbing, low quality remodeling, or pest issues that can add an additional 5-10+% to the home's cost before move-in.

As everyone already knows, pricing is high now. Eventually it will come down, just a question of how long you can wait. The last real estate 'bubble' lasted about 2-3 years before crashing.

You can't. lol. Not in collin county. At least not at any decent place. Check out East Plano there are a few places there. Also look into from someone direct. This is hard but your best bet. If your charge was less than 4 years ago sorry to say but you're screwed. You'll need to go to Dallas. Or rent a room at an extended stay.

"That's already the case. Plano offers the highest exemptions on homesteaded properties in the county. The standard amount plus 20 percent of the market value.

"Plano is almost built out. There won't be many more single family homes in the area. 

Only way inventory increases is if something is done about the foreign, hedge fund, and rental owners. Increase the tax rate while also increasing the homestead exemption so it's a net neutral for homeowners but makes it more expensive for these investors. They might opt out of Plano and buy where it is more profitable.",t2_1qzgq,hippielove,0,1648084353.0,0,t1_i1vhitn,i1vhitn,False,DFW_Realtor_Amy,t3_tk7gs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/plano/comments/tk7gs4/plano_singlefamily_housing_market_indicators/,"Plano Single-Family Housing Market Indicators, updated on 03/21/2022",/r/plano/comments/tk7gs4/plano_singlefamily_housing_market_indicators/i1vhitn/,2,r/plano,0,2
