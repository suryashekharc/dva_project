"I know that sometimes there are mechanical keyboard fan groups / meetups in certain cities. I looked and couldn't find one that was still active in San Diego on meetup.com. I did find these two links which might be relevant in helping you find a group or person willing to give you some more hands on experience with mechanical keyboards.

I own the Kinesis Gaming freestyle (v1) RGB split mechanical keyboard with MX brown keys, wrist pads, and the tenting addon (to adjust angle of the keyboard).

It seems they don't make it anymore. 

I'm happy with it, though would probably avoid the RGB upcharge next time (if possible) and maybe choose a slightly less noisy keyboard—working from home doesn't warrant the cost. 

Otherwise, I'd probably want a keyboard that I could change the switches and keys out on myself, which isn't possible on my current setup.

You can buy a keyboard switch tester to test all the different types of Cherry switches.  About 30 bucks on Amazon. I would recommend trying them out first before you commit to an expensive keyboard.

"I love whole mechanical keyboard hobby, but I don't know of any actual places in San Diego that have a large array of different switch types, keycaps, cases, stabilizers, etc. As far as I know, I think the whole mechanical keyboard hobby and marketing exists mostly online (and at times can be very expensive, especially if we're talking collectible or group-buy keycaps or very high-quality stabilizers). I do remember people talking about Fry's, but that place is long-gone. Anytime I've seen a keyboard in person in the electronics sections of stores, they always have ""gaming"" keyboards with clicky (annoying) blue switches out on display.

As for testing different key switches, I know that KBDfans has a tester of 72 switches of many different brands and their styles as shown here, and it's currently on sale for $60 (depending on your budget, it could be a good idea or bad one, considering I made a pretty good for that price): [here](https://kbdfans.com/products/kbdfans-72-switches-tester-all-in-one)

And as for keycap styles, I always refer to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14bQeqhlTNM&t=527s) nice video as a guide, and bible.

I grew up experiencing taking the trash to the dump myself. As a kid I would take trash to the dump with my dad in his pickup truck. But this is an important point that you're making that I have made to younger people. We have experienced the delivery of services and goods that we take for granted in the age of online purchases from our mobile phones. I grow vegetables and keep chickens because I have experienced farm life so I feel more secure than most do who have never had to grow their own food or slaughter an animal. If you can't take care of your own needs then you need to depend on these services. Will society eventually evolve to the point of not allowing me to grow my own food and raise chickens in the city limits?

HE HAS MILLIONS, PLUS me in HIS CHURCH, PRAYING for 'you'! But 'your' remarks have a littLe more value than a ""cockroach"" ...  ""So LAUGH all you want!!!

KNOWING what your  LIFE means ... I must PRAY for you, suspecting even a ""roach"" IS capable of LOVE!  IT'S time for 'you' to scurry  back into the DARKNESS and SEE how ""SAD"" ...  your existence has BECOME!

RUN back into the DARK, where no one sees or cares ...  but KNOW this, 'you' are ""powerless"" to STOP the LOVE ... JESUS has for ""you""!!!!  IF,  you are capable REASON, then be glad that someone like ""ME"" is telling ""you,"" to REPENT and change, before JESUS ""SOON"" RETURN!

I'm mostly kidding, nothing wrong with Black Angus, but if you walk even just 2-3 blocks to the east along E, you'll run into La Quinta and Camaron restaurants,  and Zorba's and Filipi's just a couple blocks north.

"It's certainly not the nicest part of CV, but it's not dangerous. That area during the crime wave/crack epidemic of 20-30 years ago was very shady, but that has mostly subsided. Just keep your wits about you at night, like you would in any city. In the daytime, the biggest danger is the traffic trying to get on the freeway. Be careful if you're walking around, even in the crosswalks. 

You're right by the trolley, if that's how you'll be traveling while you're here.  Very convenient. Visit the Living Coast Discovery Center if you have time.

"Sooo there is a dicey section that the road isn't so smooth. Might not be the most comfortable when you're on harbor right when passing Barrio Logan (if you check out the map). But if you're down for a full day trip you could always cut into the neighborhood and pop back out around 8th and the path is pretty smooth again. 

Whatever you do have fun! I grew up in San Diego proper and moved down to Chula Vista 3-4 years ago and have absolutely fallen in love with it. There is always something new to see! Like, if you go south on the Bayshore bikeway from E instead of north, you'll hit South Bay Salt Works- a literal sea salt farm & processing plant. The name has changed but it's the oldest running business in the city of Chula vista and it's really nuts to see the shallow pools of salt water in different stages of drying/harvest. And Imperial Beach is one of the cutest Beach cities ever. The Bayshore bikeway can get you from E to the coast of Imperial Beach  (most south-west beach town in the USA and hits the border) and back again- also flat!

"Dude do the Bayshore bike way. It's right off of e.

I was young, dumb, and struggling to survive during those years. In retrospect,  I should of reached out to Human Resources. I don't think the Family-Owners are in on it. Just some sketchy employees.

Police are asking for the public to think back and recall if they saw this car pulled over to the side of the road.  Larry stated at one point, he was in Torrey Pines.  On Jan 8th Larry’s employer was frantically phoning Larry and Maya worried about where Larry was and why he hadn’t shown up for work. His boss even phoned Larry’s Father.  A navigation event on January 8th at approximately 3pm, took place approximately two hours out from Mayas home.  Police believe she could be in that area (two hours from her home).  January 8th Larry’s father texted Larry’s phone begging him to respond to his boss as to why he was not at work. There is so much more the DA is giving at this PC, so please go back and listen.  On January 8th Larry told Mayas brother that he was at work and didn’t know where Maya was.

"Apple Tree on 3rd was the original one. It's been there for about 20 years. It might be family owned, as in distant family, not siblings or anything like that. I have never heard it as a franchise but what I can say about the one on Broadway is that I'm almost certain it is owned by a Middle Eastern family but has all Mexican products/deli food.

Your best bet is to stop by and ask. The big boss for Broadway is usually at the front of the store, shaved head and almost always wearing all black. What's the worst that can happen?

"I was driving up F-street when I notice these people (ABOUT TWENTY), using their ""RIGHT of ASSEMBLY"" and to ""PROTEST with a BULLHORN!""  The person with the BULLHORN was encouraging those gathered to disregard the ""RIGHTS"" of the public by blocking the egress of this man walking towards Third Avenue.  I NOTICED/HEARD the ""ANGRY-CROWD"" screaming and cussing at this elderly man\[???\]  There was a young woman with a ""FILTHY-MOUTH"", ""SCREAMING and CURSING"" -- 4-LETTER WORDS at this poor/scared Latino-man!

About 10 Chula Vista Police came out of the police station, I was now in the Library's parking lot, across the street from the police station, looking in amazement thinking ... there's going to be a RIOT!!  The 'Latino' with the BULLHORN and the young 'Latina-women were trying to get at the ""Senior Latino-Man' ... \[??\]  The young woman was SCREAMING and CUSSING like a ""Drunkin-WHORE""!  And the man with the BULLHORN was pushing the officer, trying to get at the SCARED ""Senior-Man!

I was WONDERING ... WHY DON'T THE POLICE ARREST THE MAN/WOMAN???

I wanted to HELP the senior man ... but I didn't want to get ""INVOLVED"" (I later realized), I was ""NO BETTER"" than that person with the BULLHORN ... or that woman with such a FILTHY-MOUTH!!  The Police are there to PROTECT AND SERVE THE PUBLIC ... NOT TO BE LIKE THE ""texas rangers!!""

"Original CV is very Mexican American small townish feel and new CV (Eastlake and Otay Ranch area) is very cookie cutter developments. Bunch of local high schools and a big community college in the middle of old and new CV. Here are some ramblings of the two areas:

Hogetsu bakery is in the same plaza as Naruto and has handmade mochi, cash only.

"I'm trying to picture this. How do you get home? Walk the bike?

If you have regular clincher or beaded tires (not tubeless) and quick release wheels then fixing tires isn't that hard of a job. It's one of those skills you want to pick up to avoid expense and getting stranded some place. Hmm ... maybe the new hydraulic brakes make tire-changing harder. 

The tires that come new with bikes are often not top-of-the-line. Getting a set of tires with a reputation for durability helps. If you don't want to upgrade both tires consider just getting the rear tire upgraded (that's the one that usually gets the flats and that is harder to fix.) Going 3000 miles without a flat really improves your mood ;-)",t2_xxpkl,Markqz,0,1623955224.0,0,t1_h24cgbz,h24cgbz,False,runningwithehunted,t3_o1eor1,https://www.reddit.com/r/chulavista/comments/o1eor1/bike_lanes/,Bike Lanes,/r/chulavista/comments/o1eor1/bike_lanes/h24cgbz/,2,r/chulavista,0,2
I'm pretty new to riding and have been taking my bike in to have the tire changed with each puncture. The cost is adding up.

"CV roads are better than most, and they'll usually respond to a see-click-fix post. But in general, I ended up ditching light-weight tires for the heavier randonneurs. I've only recently started experimenting with lighter tires again, on the theory that they'll be easier to take on/off the bike.

You are patching your tubes, right? Tubes are running $7 or more these days.  I carry a new tube with me and use it on the road, and patch the tube when I get home. This saves a little time when making a fix on the road. Also it can be very hard to find the leak if you're near traffic -- which you always are in CV/SD ! 

You're most likely to get a puncture on rainy days, which we don't have many of.

The only potential downside I see to the area is the distance from the typical employment centers of the county. Downtown is manageable, but anything further north will give you a brutal commute.

We end up having to park 10 min walk away which isn’t a big deal but imagine doing that every day. 

Schools are great and there are a lot of jobs for high school/college age kids since the mall is right there. It has pretty much everything you need right there but it’s definitely out of the way since there is no major freeway near by. If you want to pay $3 each way you can shave off a decent amount of time headed north but again, imagine doing this every day.

"I have lived in Eastlake for 20 years and so far as I am concerned it was a wonderful place to grow up. 

You’re coming in at a good time where the schools are fully developed but admittedly it’s been a while since I went there. When I was going to elementary there I never had any problems except for the occasional teacher I did not get along with, but never for lack of quality education. 

Unfortunately, Sweetwater school district does have funding issues but thankfully I do not know any students who have been directly effected. Although it is important to know that there my be some teacher v school board politics (but that’s about every school district I know where the teachers actually give a damn).

Concerning Spanish, Chula Vista and the South Bay San Diego (both the city and part of the county of which Eastlake is a part of) are talked about in a kind of racially coded way for being large immigrant communities. The largest group with historical ties is obviously people of Mexican Descent (shout out to mis compas) so especially in the parts of Chula Vista west of the 5 freeway you will hear much more Spanish but the whole region is very bilingual. 

Eastlake specifically is like a microcosm of the US, huge mix of people from out of state (retirees and military), people whose families have lived in the area forever, and immigrants from all over the world but most notably Mexico and a lot of folks from the Philippines. That’s still a bit reductive but needless to say the diversity is pretty wonderful. 

If there is any downside most people would say distance to downtown and some of the office hubs in north county. Both have traffic on the way. Downtown traffic can be annoying but is mild compared to the commute to like Sorrento Valley and Mira Mesa depending on the time of day. That being said, after having lived on the east coast and Bay Area and LA, traffic is fairly tame.

Obviously the housing prices are also brutal but don’t forget that when the neighborhood was first built in 1999, most people didn’t want it to live there because it was like buying a big house out in the sticks. That was nice because a lot of working class folks who couldn’t afford a nice house in the city of San Diego could afford one in Eastlake. Now the community is very developed, plenty of little shopping centers and two malls that are very close.

Vue was described as an Asian woman, about 4-foot, 10-inches tall, weighing 100 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes.

She was last seen wearing a pink jacket, black pants, white shoes and carrying a black backpack.

Vue needs medicine daily and speaks limited English, police said.

She was seen being pushed in a wheelchair by the male southbound on Bay Boulevard near F St in Chula Vista.

Vue is fully ambulatory and does not require a wheelchair for mobility, police said.

The unknown male was described by police as a possible transient, white or Hispanic male, wearing a black jacket, blue jersey and black pants. The man has a thin build, with shoulder-length brown or black hair.

Vue lives in San Diego and is unfamiliar with Chula Vista, according to police.

The disappearance was being investigated by the CVPD Patrol Division.",t2_9y5dsuf1,According-Steak-2402,0,1622412754.0,0,t1_h00pvda,h00pvda,True,According-Steak-2402,t3_nolxyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/chulavista/comments/nolxyx/missing_atrisk_chula_vista_woman_last_seen/,Missing at-risk Chula Vista woman last seen leaving casino with unknown male,/r/chulavista/comments/nolxyx/missing_atrisk_chula_vista_woman_last_seen/h00pvda/,3,r/chulavista,0,3

"I got stationed down in Imperial Beach in late ‘05 and used to drive through Eastlake to go out to Southbay Rod and Reel gun range a few times a month for the Navy. It always looked like a nice area with lots of nearby shopping, but the apartment we had just off Palm and the 5 was just too convenient to give up. Plus prices were still on the rise. If I hadn’t been stationed overseas in ‘11 we were seriously considering some apartments over here to move to. 

Fast forward to ‘14 and we are moving back and getting stationed in IB again. We were planning to buy, but the most important thing for us was schools for my high school sophomore. Looking at ratings, it was a choice between this area with Olympian and Eastlake both having great ratings or up in Poway. To hell with commuting from Poway!

We ended up getting a townhouse style condo. Shopping is still convenient with Vons, Walmart, Target and Sprouts (and Barrons now too) within a few mile. The completion of the bus line bridge over the 125 makes a short walk over to the Town-center Mall for a bite to eat, catch a movie, or light shopping. The morning traffic down Olympic Pkwy got to be a bit annoying sometimes, but the addition of the connector over the hill on Heritage helped avoid the 805 cluster-f*. The 125 itself with the Southbay express pass thing was also a lifesaver for my son when he started going to SDSU. We’re pretty happy and appreciation in our condo value over the last 6 year has been great. 

On a side note my wife ended up getting a job in Poway working the night shift a medical lab, but she has 0 traffic going to work and usually misses the morning rush of people driving into town in the mornings.",t2_b0ryc,Shidhe,0,1620048360.0,0,t1_gws3mfe,gws3mfe,True,ZidaneSD,t3_n3ip4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/chulavista/comments/n3ip4i/otayeastlake_area_changes/,Otay/Eastlake area changes,/r/chulavista/comments/n3ip4i/otayeastlake_area_changes/gws3mfe/,4,r/chulavista,0,4

"I've been living out here since '99 and honestly, I have not seen any drawbacks other than the shopping centers being slightly more crowded which makes me happy because I know a lot of people who have been holding out for the big population boom that was promised in the early 2000's.

In the Mid-2000's the schools weren't equipped to handle such a rapid influx of people and there was serious overcrowding at the Middle Schools and High Schools for a couple years. There were also 2 firestorms which had half the neighborhood evacuating.

As businesses and new shopping centers moved to cash-in on the new development, the recession hit. There were five houses on my block that foreclosed, lots of businesses slowly held on until they couldn't anymore. It was not until the mid-2010's that things felt like they were really growing again and even then I hadn't really notice any change until the late 2010's. And then the 'rona came and stalled a lot of that once again.

Prices are still going up, people are still moving in, but at a slower rate than it was. The biggest complaint I hear sometimes is that traffic has gotten worse, but that's more a reflection of San Diego county rather than Otay/Eastlake. Even then, the transit corridors are nice to see. 

Most of the new developments currently under construction were in the works before I moved in '99, but the economic hurdles just slowed down building. The way I see it, the plans that were always in place are just coming to fruition. 

TL;DR: Most of the changes I have noticed have been incidental and were always a part of the original plan. No drawbacks, some small benefits.",t2_9q0b5,Zarathustra2,0,1619999145.0,0,t1_gwq34cf,gwq34cf,True,ZidaneSD,t3_n3ip4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/chulavista/comments/n3ip4i/otayeastlake_area_changes/,Otay/Eastlake area changes,/r/chulavista/comments/n3ip4i/otayeastlake_area_changes/gwq34cf/,6,r/chulavista,0,6

Your list of pros pretty much confirmed the initial impression I got of the area - people were nice, many amenities within walking distance, quieter vibes, etc.

The crime issue is something my SO was especially concerned about although a lot of the research I have done shows relatively low crime rates compared to the rest of San Diego county. Would be something to factor in and pay attention to.

"Worst part is you don't see the Mello Roos until tax time, so seeing double what a redfin/zillow calculator displayed can be a bit of sticker shock.  

When calculating what you can afford, it's important to realize that an extra $400/mo HOA+Mello Roos fee is the equivalent to an extra $100k purchase price (at 2.5% over 30 years).....and you continue to pay that forever, even after the mortgage is paid off.   

Also, some houses (and most condo/town homes) in Otay Ranch are in two HOAs, the Master association for the entire development that covers amenities, and then the sub development that covers the exclusive use common areas (anything gated, private roads, security, etc.).

"I live about a mile from there. 

- Very Urban feeling (literally every major living need is in walking distance, public transit stations and it has a calm feeling overall)
- People are nice and most abide by the mask rules, but there's some attraction with Karen's and Starbucks or the World Market I just can't explain
- If you like hiking, fishing, going to parks and any other outdoor sports you'll love the proximity to locations for said hobbies.
- Great Verizon and T-Mobile cell signal towers nearby, but it's almost a deadzone for other providers
- Cox Gigablast and ATT Fiber Internet are options

Downsides:

- As another said: It's HOA hell in some of those developments, so read the fine print. Just be careful. Examples: Our HOA is literally only $30/mo, but it is also $400/mo. for the development next to mine. Eastlake Greens Golf Course is easily the worst I know of w/ 2 x HOA + Melrose.
- The 3 Story units being sold are a bit cramped for my taste, but they are built well and some have an ocean view from the 125 outlook and are affordable. Simply avoid the ones near the power and cell towers if possible. 
-  Section 8 housing across from Wal-Mart less than a mile away has given rise to a lot of new crime issues. History on Crime Reports websites shows ~60% increase in misdemeanor theft over the past 2 years
- Homelessness showing up in the area now, but still low. Just surprising since there was none 5 years ago

Personal complaint: 

Police, Fire, Schools and other services are suffering due to the massive growth of the area.
