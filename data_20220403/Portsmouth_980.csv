"Exeter?  I barely entered her!

Sorry.  Anyway, Exeter is very nice, and very close to Portsmouth.  I can't really think of any negatives, it's pretty much like everywhere else in the seacoast area.  The only thing I can say is every year the tourist season gets more and more busy, and honestly it's not just the summertime, it's basically year round at this point.  It gets aggravating with traffic and parking.  Going to the beach or going to a restaurant can be difficult with nonstop hordes of tourists.  

If you find the prices are still too steep in Exeter, try Newmarket or Dover.  Same general area.  Dover has traditionally been where you move it you work in Portsmouth but can't afford to live there, but I think now even Dover's real estate is bonkers.  Or so I've heard.

">As far as the snowshoeing I was thinking of travelling to the mountains so I'll look into the places you listed.

Right on. I **love** snowshoeing, but it can be really hard to find a worthwhile place. The popular trails are... popular, so unless you are making first tracks after a storm, it tends to get packed down and then snowshoes are somewhat cumbersome over packed snow/ice and I resort to microspikes anyway. But there are a lot of backsides of the main hiking areas that are ripe for a good snowshoe.

If you want to snowshoe fast, check out the local snowshoe racing series. There's basically one brand of snowshoes that literally everyone uses (around $300 IIRC) but it looks like a blast. Unfortunately with new kids & covid I didn't get into yet, but I'd love to try someday. Also, a bunch of the ski areas do a winter racing series where you run/ski uphill and back down.

 Portsmouth is more expensive for rent. Dover, Somersworth, Rochester, Durham, Lee, Madbury, Barrington are great places to look at for housing, they are cheaper. Sure, not as nice, but Portsmouth is considered the ""Ritzy"" city area in NH's Seacoast. 

Great local places to eat: Dante's in Barrington, Christopher's in Dover, Las Palmas in Somersworth, The Goat in Portsmouth, The Farm in Dover. 

No sales or income tax, so that's pretty freaking cool. 

There's lots of farmers markets, theaters, events, etc. that you can find out from your local town's FB or Twitter page generally that are great ways to meet people. As well as seasonal fairs, and festivals. 

Apple Harvest (COVID permitting) in Dover is an absolute blast with local vendors, and businesses, live music, food, etc.

"Appreciate the solid advice, I'm going to look into all those places! Yeah hockey is very much a Canadian thing, sometimes you can't escape stereotypes haha. As far as the snowshoeing I was thinking of travelling to the mountains so I'll look into the places you listed. 

So I actually got into pickle ball from my US friends. Had no idea it was a retiree sport (although should have guessed since they're from FL).

"I haven't seen much for ice hockey in the area. There's a few rinks around, but it's more of a touristy thing at Portsmouth's Strawbery Banke, or a locals thing at the Durham or Dover rinks. Beyond college/university, I've never heard of someone that plays hockey in the US, vs nearly every Canadian I know seems to play hockey.

There isn't much for snowshoeing around. If we get a foot of snow (er, 30cm), then hurry outside and go snowshoe up Stratham Hill, Mt Agamenticus, or Blue Job. It will all melt or get crusty within a couple days. For the most part, winter hiking requires microspikes even in the flat areas. Note that Portsmouth tends to be slightly warmer on the coast, so snow rarely stays soft for long.

Tons of mountains for hiking, even without the 2 hour drive all the way into the White Mountains. The Belknap Range which includes the very popular Mt Major is basically a requirement to hike each year. It's stupidly overpacked on summer weekends, but go on a weekday or in winter and it's great. The Ossipee range is like a secret club and no one talks about these amazing mountains, mostly because it's not managed by public entities. Hook up with the local running clubs (e.g. six03) - a bunch of those people hike everything and anything. Or join the AMC young adults group. Each mountain range area also has a facebook presence with meet ups.

Funny you mention pickleball. It's been gaining popularity (all over the US maybe?), but as a sport for... let's say, 'retirees'. The average age might be 50s-70s.

Portsmouth is indeed silly expensive. A lot of 20-somethings make it work because nothing else around has much of a 'scene'. But then again a lot of 20-somethings that can't afford Portsmouth will go to Dover (not a whole lot cheaper) or Rochester/Rollinsford/Somersworth. Basically the farther from the coast, the cheaper it gets.",t2_12s0uh,thishasntbeeneasy,0,1644026507.0,0,t1_hvn968r,hvn968r,True,ghostertoaster,t3_skrr73,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortsmouthNH/comments/skrr73/moving_to_portsmouth/,Moving to Portsmouth,/r/PortsmouthNH/comments/skrr73/moving_to_portsmouth/hvn968r/,1,r/PortsmouthNH,0,1

"Grew up in seacoast NH, lived in Manahattan and a few other major cities post college , and now back to Portsmouth 

A few thoughts for you:
1. There will be a good deal of people who already know each other from this area who have established circles , but that‚Äôs any city really from my experience , and people from NH are friendly 
2. Portsmouth is experiencing a ton of folks move here from out of town / state. The CrossFit gym I go to probably consists of 50% of folks not from around here . Honestly a really good place to meet awesome people 
3. The quality of life in Portsmouth is unmatched. Right by the beach , mountains , can take C&J bus to Boston for $10.. and 70+ bars and restaurants

"I moved here from Washington DC this summer and have been loving the change! (30yr F) 

I knew I wanted a smaller town vibe, but couldn‚Äôt completely give up being able to walk to an bar/ restaurant / brewery just yet. 

I‚Äôve found Portsmouth offers me the pros of:

-everything you could need is max 8 mins away - or closer. I live closer to a grocery store and cocktail bar now than I did in downtown DC. Want a target? 6 mins down the road. A dog park? Plenty. Hair salon? A billion. 
-Cost of living - while yes rent insanely is high, lack of income/ sales taxes mixed with generally most things being less expensive than the city are positive. If you‚Äôre renting, you skip the high property taxes.
-Dog friendly (big for me‚Ä¶ I have a yard now, unheard of before)
-access to ocean/ mountains/ lake
-Boston really isn‚Äôt that far - I go every other weekend to see friends.. have not had an issue. The train/ bus are also options.
-Safety 
-strong community - I‚Äôm new and still looking for my tribe but there are plenty of sporting leagues, interest groups, classes etc. 

I‚Äôd recommend looking at the Seacoast Housing group on Facebook.. that‚Äôs how I found my apartment. If you‚Äôre looking for friends and roommates there are plenty of people posting looking for someone to live with. 

As far as a scene - lots of cool cocktail spots (the wilder, the dram), places to go out if that‚Äôs your thing, and I think you can find what you‚Äôre looking for with some time.

"Trial apartment may be difficult to find but there is a Residence Inn at Pease that does offer short term stays apt style.  Have no idea what the cost is.  
Had some relatives move to the West End Yards apts on RT 1 near Portsmouth Hospital and they pay more than $2000. per month for a small apt.

Seacoast area is crowded.  Traffic has gotten worse over the past few years.  
The seacoast area towns are pass throughs for MA traffic heading north, and ME traffic heading south.  Roads in this area can become congested during the summer.  
Bad news -- UNH students seek out apt life off campus wherever the Coast bus routes are.  
Popular rental towns for UNH students - Newmarket (check out Cheney Co rentals: Bennett Way, Cherry Hill, or Mead Hill) just off 108 near town), Dover, Portsmouth, Exeter, Somersworth, Rochester.  In some places, rents for UNH students are PER student PER month, not your typical basic rent per month, so be aware of that.

Good news, you can catch the Downeaster to Boston in Dover, Durham, Exeter.  Parking is another story at the train stops.  
Another alternative way in Dover, Portsmouth or Seabrook is the C&J bus that goes right to Boston.

"I moved back to NH around 28/29 or so. I don't do the bar or gaming scene and not quite sure what too many other 20-somethings do. I found the running clubs and cycling groups a good way to meet some people and have a regular activity. I'm big into hiking, but mostly went with my partner or family. The running clubs overlap a bit with some serious hikers and trail runners, so I'd otherwise have done a bit more with them probably.

I have to drive down to Boston with some frequency, though not weekly. It's soul-sucking to have to do it during commute times, and my trip is usually about 1.5 hours each way. I would definitely not want that even as a part time commute if I could avoid it, but I know people have different views on how much driving is reasonable. Maybe that's fine for a single person, but definitely not something I'd put up with now having a family.

Portsmouth is specifically very high rents and home prices. It goes down as you get farther away from the coast. Dover is more reasonable, for example.

"Nope. Not in NH. Each town has its own jurisdiction and therefore makes its own rules. The police board are just locals that know the cops. They are unlikely to support rules that shed light on these things.

Ironically there was a law suit to protect the records of Aaron Goodwin( the brother of Todd from the linked article). I can‚Äôt find any articles on it.  It looks like Foster Daily Democrat Aka Seacoast Online has taken down the article. They are owned by Gannet (USA Today)

"While I generally agree we need both the gas and break of society one of the things that I think swung the election was that while a lot of people were upset about the rate of development in with the hotels and the reaction of the City Council was to obstruct just regular residents from doing residential projects instead of doing managing the actual large scale and high rate of development in downtown.

I think that along with: Becksted equivocating about masks, Ester doing some petty personal fraud to the detriment of the city in the middle of the pandemic that she got caught for because she was tech savvy enough to pull off but not enough to cover up, and then the complete and utter shitshow that is the MacIntyre project; I think people just had it.

It was only an issue in Pease. When the airforce base was created they made their own water distribution system and treatment plant so it was isolated and not connected to Portsmouth's. Portsmouth has its own water treatment and distribution system. The largest water producing well in the area was the haven well. When the military took it from Portsmouth they had to find another source to replace that volume of water so they built the Marbury reservoir and water treatment plant in Marbury and ran pipes all the way from there to Portsmouth. Then the military built runways around the well.  Over the years firefighting foams and pfas/pfoas polluted the well. After the military decided they didn't want the base anymore they gave the area back to Portsmouth while having it run by the PDA (Pease Development Authority). The water systems are still separate and Portsmouth just happens to run both.

"I'm actually a nurse, so my answer will be more safety minded than whatever individual establishment's rules are :) Masks certainly don't seem to be required everywhere, but due to the rise in the Delta variant throughout the country, I'm personally still wearing masks indoors in public spaces, and prefer avoiding anything crowded indoors. I dine and drink outside whenever the option presents itself, and most places are set up for it. If you're double vaccinated though (as you should be by now, unless your Dr said it was medically contraindicated for you), you'll be safe anyway, just might asymptomatically spread it (but again, if other peeps are vaxxed up too, they should be fine so it's less of a worry now). I suspect you'll be around a few right-leaning peeps at the shipyard, but unless they're medical professionals, take what they ""recommend"" with a pinch of salt.

"Coco Loco's is literally down the street from the Naval Shipyard, and though it ain't fancy, they have some amazing tacos, the carnitas being my fave. 5 Thai has excellent food too, and I'm always torn between their crispy duck and the cashew chicken, but literally everything on the menu is good. The Black Birch in Kittery is always excellent too. There's a great upscale Mexican restaurant called Vida Cantina out on Rte 1, just past Water Country. In downtown Portsmouth, I've always liked the intimate restaurant Cure, and The Black Trumpet was one of the first truly upscale eateries in the town. For sandwiches I'm partial to The Kitchen, and Cafe Kilim just next door to it has the best coffee in town. Diagonally across the road from both of them is Lexie's Joint, which is a small, very casual, and tasty burger joint. Speaking of burgers, Gilley's li'l carriage does my fave ones in town, but last time I tried to go they weren't open for some reason. I kinda like *every* pizza joint in town too, for different reasons. Colby's is tiny but does a good breakfast. I'll let someone else advise re seafood choices, cos they're not my forte, though I think Jumpin Jay's Fish Cafe is meant to be one of the best.

"I recently relocated to Portsmouth from out-of-state with a similar budget. With a budget in the $1500-2000 range, you're unfortunately still going to be making sacrifices with your living space if you want to be in Portsmouth proper. I toured a newer apartment complex on the edge of town, one apartment centrally downtown, and a split house (6 apts on 3 floors) in town near the water. 

Each had their downsides. The newer complex is a 3/4 mile walk to the center of downtown, and pushed my budget the most. The central apartment was tiny with questionable climate control and no parking. The split house hadn't seen an update to the kitchen/bathroom since LBJ.

That being said, Portsmouth is an awesome town that I really enjoy living in. Great restaurants and shops, beautiful surroundings, etc. I would recommend taking a day if possible to tour or facetime tour several places in the area. Be sure to check off things like parking, A/C, appliances for each (some will be lacking what you might find important). If you decide you'd be happy in a shoebox with a great location, great! If you're cool with biking into town instead of walking, and are cool paying up for new construction, awesome. There are options in your price range but they won't be perfect.

"So I actually tried to find snow depth data but not finding a great graphic about it from reliable sources, and there are more factors than just snow falling. NH does get more snow then CT/RI and coastal MA for sure. But Portsmouth gets far less than the rest of the state, and even less so than upstate NY or VT.  


When snow falls in Portsmouth, it tends to melt quickly. It's can often be 5-10f warmer along the coast, and since our winters tend to hover around 30-40f in daytime, that make a big difference with melting.

&#x200B;

This is why xc skiing doesn't really exist anywhere along the coast - it requires having at least some snow/ice on the ground already (even 2 inches can do it), then enough snow to get packed down (at least 6 more inches), but if it reaches 40-45f that day, then it's essentially a puddle the next day and unusable.

&#x200B;

The question OP is likely trying to figure out is how often is it unfeasible to drive somewhere due to snow. There tends to be about 3-6 major enough snow events per season, but it varies wildly. 2020-21 had more snow than the several years before it. Populated places like Portsmouth get roads cleared out in good time (same day for main roads, maybe 2-3 days to get most others unless it melts first).",t2_12s0uh,thishasntbeeneasy,0,1629820998.0,0,t1_ha6c4r8,ha6c4r8,False,[deleted],t3_pa75g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortsmouthNH/comments/pa75g5/hurricanestropical_storms/,Hurricanes/Tropical Storms,/r/PortsmouthNH/comments/pa75g5/hurricanestropical_storms/ha6c4r8/,2,r/PortsmouthNH,0,2

You have to apply via the careers section.  And it goes to hca Corp.  Total pain in the arse but...

Then you will get assigned a recruiter which is centralized out of TN.

People bitch about HCA...they have been absolutely fantastic to me.  I think its what you make of it.  

Exeter WDH and everyone N of me pay less and treated their employees like shit during the height of the pandemic.   

I was a Vet Tech until about 5y ago, went to Great Bay, got my MA.  1st job there...left (because the grass is always greener! Lol) and went back 2 yrs ago.

Anyone in my MA program that signed up for Exeter, hated it and left.  Plus I think Exeter is MA sign up NOT LNA, I've yet to see LNA programs advertised with them.

Just my experience.   Not sure what state you are trying to xfer from.

"Basically gets cheaper the farther you get from the coast. Dover is about 75% the cost of Portsmouth. Somersworth/Rollinsford/Rochester cheaper still. Beyond that I don't see a whole lot of apartment complexes but likely eventually flattens out pretty cheap until you start getting close to the Lakes Region vacation homes. Similarly, Eliot or Berwicks Maine might be reasonably priced with fewer options but kinda podunky.

Probably not worth trying in Durham/Lee/Madbury because the students are all over the apartments there when school UNH is in session.

"From the NYT:

No legal adjudication is possible in the heat of battle. But Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages on Gaza killed at least 198 Palestinians, including 93 women and children, between last Monday and Sunday evening, according to Palestinian authorities, producing stark images of destruction that have reverberated around the world.  
In the other direction, Hamas missiles have rained over Israeli towns and cities, sowing fear and killing at least 10 people, including two children ‚Äî a greater toll than during the last war, in 2014, which lasted more than seven weeks. The latest victim, a 55-year-old man, died on Saturday after missile shrapnel slammed through the door of his home in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan.

&#x200B;

Incidentally, in the fighting in 2014, over 2000 Palestinians were killed, mostly civilians, while only 70 Israelis were killed, only 6 of them civilians.

"I'll admit I wasn't a fan at first. I had two main gripes: the pavement wasn't ready (there are bad sewer grates in the road and off-camber slope) and that riding to the right of cars means less visibility by the intersections like Cass. Thankfully they removed a few parking spots by Cass, but I would still approach cautiously and wave at turning drivers to make sure they see me.

I'm an experienced city rider and know what to expect. For the most part I'd rather just ride in the road because at 15-20mph I'd prefer more space than what was given between parked cars and the curb. With bad pavement, recycling bins, unswept debris, etc, the lane was never great for riding at that speed.

But the lane wasn't designed for me. It's a ""Safe Route to School"" which was intended to be safe for all ages (we often say 8-80). While I'd feel safest in the street, I don't think it would be appropriate to tell an 8 year old to ride in the street. People going 5-10mph should be really safe in the bike lane, and won't have the same issues I do at intersections because they'd be approaching slower.

The experts had some good ideas to improve the lane even more by changing some of the parking by intersections further, and adding the bollards back in. People whined about the view of bollards, but they worked. Honestly, I don't get the complaint that a bollard ruins the historic view of the street when the sight of parked cars is much worse.",t2_12s0uh,thishasntbeeneasy,0,1617891728.0,0,t1_gttabvo,gttabvo,False,thishasntbeeneasy,t3_mm4t75,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortsmouthNH/comments/mm4t75/welcome_to_portsmouth/,Welcome to Portsmouth?,/r/PortsmouthNH/comments/mm4t75/welcome_to_portsmouth/gttabvo/,4,r/PortsmouthNH,0,4
"I had a healthy debate with some friends a few weeks back about the flip flop and was interested that they were in favor of the bike lanes being on the outside of the cars rather than on the inside.  

I argued that drivers can see cyclists more easily in their mirror and that having the rest of the road (rather than a granite curb) to be able to move into felt safer to me.

"> ...Get rid of cars in Market Square and make it into outdoor seating and public space like on Church Street in Burlington.

The only problem with that is that Daniel St. from the bridge to Congress then to the corner of Maplewood then down Middle Rd. is literally US Rte 1. Northbound it is State St. to the bridge. 

Any closure of restriction falls afoul of the highway rules and regs, as Rte. 1 is a US Highway System road.

Part of why it was not restricted down to one lane for outdoor dining, like Pleasant St. and Penhallow are..

"City council asked for an expert review and paid about $12k for it. They grilled the guy with ridiculous questions, and tried to say that he wasn't certified in NH (the company is, of course) or that he didn't physically sign the report. That report outlined a few safety improvements that could be made like changing one end of the lane to reduce entrance onto the bike lane outbound, and to remove a couple parking spots by intersections for visibility, which had been a top concern from residents. Those changes were an estimated cost of $1,400.

Instead, they spent another 10k or so on the botched paint job, and in all likeliness seem headed for ignoring the Safe Routes to School Grant which would incur $230,000 to be repaid, plus the 80k wasted painting the lanes the first time, plus some other costs in design work for more changes.

A bit too 'Romper Room' for my tastes and a prime reason why I stopped biking down Middle road.

"Longer version: A group called Pop Up Portsmouth was being created and talked with the city about finding a public place they could set up a socially distanced eating and music venue. The group was operating with the Rep theatre as a 'fiscal sponsor' which is something that often happens when a nonprofit is started quicker than the state can recognize them.

Esther apparently didn't like that a not-yet-a-non-profit was going to be using city money to benefit residents, and forgot about other arrangements with fiscal sponsors that the city uses, so she registered the name before they did, and bought the domain name too.

She didn't give it back to them, so the group registered as Pop Up NH instead. An ethics panel found Esther guilty, and then it goes to the council to vote on further action. Esther then voted in favor for herself, instead of recusing herself from the vote as any ethical person would.

"City council has 9 members. 5 of them are against any type of progress in Portsmouth.

Those 5 members promised the residents along Middle St that they'd remove the bike lanes during their campaigning. They asked for engineers to review the bike lane designs, but that backfired when the reports showed that Middle St reduced car crashes to half.

Because this project went through a decade of planning and was mostly paid for with a State grant, Portsmouth would have to pay back that grant if they removed the bike lanes. Councilors bullied NH DOT to allow them 6 months to trial having the road with parked cars along the curb again, and voted as such.

But when the public works department started repainting the bike lane between parked and moving cars, the mayor went out and bullied them too. They claimed that the vote was to remove the bike lane, despite clearly asking for a ""flip-flop"" of the parking/bike lanes.

So here we now have a 20 foot wide lane that now doesn't have a bike symbol, despite there being no reason why people wouldn't continue to ride directly over the painted-over bike symbol.

Note that one city counselor smashed up cars on the street because of their inability to drive in an 11ft lane. Another had their car involved in a crash that appeared to have been driven by their partner while distracted.

"I'm not sure why they removed the markings where there's just traffic and bike lanes but I assume this has to do with the change down the road to reconfigure the bike lanes where there's traffic, parked cars, and bike lanes. 

Most of the reasons are anecdotal. People thinking it caused more accidents, people complaining that the park cars are to close to the traffic, more dangerous to cycling, all this against the advice of every professional, state official, advisor s, and statistics brought to the review. Now it's important to note that they aren't removing them but making the more like your standard bike lane, ei. Parked cars against curve with cycle lanes protecting the cars from traffic instead of bike lanes against curve and parked cars protecting them from traffic.

 The reason for the configuration that they council just removed was that that configuration is considered safer for cyclists that your standard bike lanes. Fyi this might cost the town 500k dollars in funds that must be returned to the state and federal government used to create the bike lane in the first place.
