"If you'd like to move to Phoenixville, we'd love to have you.

But you don't wanna live in those houses. They're the same price or more than lovely older houses in the Borough. Sure, the older houses need maintenance. But they'll stand forever.

"Toll Brothers are terrible. I got the weekly updates from my parents who had just bought a not-yet-built home in Collegeville. Stories, where they heard the carpets had been installed so they'd go, ask for a tour. When they arrived to see the work they found windows that were broken on the inside panes. After some drilling, my dad learned that the carpet installers are in such a hurry to finish as quickly as they can that they THROW the rolls of carpet into the rooms and sometimes break windows. And having the window installers COME BACK and replace the broken windows was cheaper than just paying the carpet installers to do it right the first time. This defines Tolls entire philosophy for construction. Toll also did shitty things such as making the front door to the house have stairs extra tall so that they'd fall UNDER the limit for a number of stairs that REQUIRE a handrail. Yes, Toll intentionally designed the stairs so that they saved the money of installing a handrail on the stairs leading into the house of a 55+ RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. My parents couldn't add one until Toll turned over control of the HOA to the residents. Then the rule was changed and the homeowners could go buy one themselves if they wanted one. 

After my folks had moved in the HOA started reporting cracks in the foundations of the homes. My parents were among them. Toll explained that unless the crack was larger than 1/4"" they didn't do anything about it. But they sent contractors several times to my parent's house to plane and rehang doors that wouldn't open/shut and walls that were cracking because of how much the foundation had settled. (for reference: My 90y/o House on the North Side still has its original doors that don't stick because my house has settled less. )

Now after 8 years they're starting up another complaint with Toll because the tape is peeling off the joints in the drywall. Their half a million-dollar home looks like it's falling down. But Toll will just send contractors to fix the drywall since they haven't finished the development yet. Making my dad repaint the patched walls, I'm sure. 

As much as I'm annoyed by the whole situation, I'm most annoyed that they found one of the WORST property builders in SEPA to redevelop it.",t2_4vms9,Mookinator,0,1648996169.0,0,t1_i38646l,i38646l,True,jaywigs,t3_tv8rnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Phoenixville/comments/tv8rnd/i_spoke_with_toll_bros_on_why_they_are_interested/,I spoke with Toll Bros on why they are interested in PXV.

"Bistro on Bridge upstairs - college aged to mid 20’s w/ usually a DJ 

Bistro on Bridge downstairs - 20s and 30s but more of a dining vibe. Also has good beer options. 

Molly McGuire’s - live music on weekend nights and typically has younger crowds. Sometimes has a cover. 

Root Down, Stable 12, Rec Room- great brewery scene with ages mainly 30s on up. Rec Room has ping pong and shuffleboard. 

Bluebird - best mixed drinks with a chill scene

Great American Pub - nice bar out back that is half inside/outside.

"Hi Phoenixville! Come join us for a screening of this wonderful film, hosted by the Heartwood Eco-poetry and performance series. Feel free to DM me questions!

From the colonial’s page: 

Join us for a spectacular visual feast showcasing the interconnectedness forests! Trees are some of the planet’s oldest communities, but only recently have scientists begun to understand how they function together as a macro-organism. Are there better forestry practices than treating trees as isolated, replaceable individuals? Or do they live a shared life deeper than we know? In this documentary, Peter Wohlleben takes us through the beautiful German beech forest in his care to illustrate the message of his monumental book, The Hidden Life of Trees.

After the film, Heartwood Eco-Poetry & Performance will showcase some of our artists and share ways you can be involved in the life of Phoenixville trees.

The afternoons are a bit longer since Lancaster Ave can get a little busy but it’s still only a 50-60min drive. Once I’m on the backroads it’s not really much of a problem.

"To Reading, 422 can get a little backed up in the regular commuting times but it wasn’t so bad when I did it. Granted I lived in Spring City when I did it, so it’s a few miles closer. I often took 724 to Reading, which is a lot less on traffic and distance-wise not so different either. You’d just take Nutt Rd. which turns into 724 eventually. 

Now driving to Philly from Phoenixville is a different story. Just traffic from anywhere to Philly can be a serious pain. 422 around Bridgeport just finally finished expanding the highway which seems to help a little. But once you get to 76, it’s just a mess.

"A lot of people have already covered the local SPCA and rescues.

If you’re looking specifically to find a reputable breeder the American Kennel Club has some online resources to find breeders, but also they have listed specific breed rescues. Also there’s a guide to explore what kind of dog breed would be good for you.

It’s not really easy to do a local search on here unless you are looking for a specific bread of dog. If you narrow it down you can read through their list to find the closest.

"That’s an odd intersection. But if you see any old photos of it, it’s been like that for decades. 

In fact, back in the 40’s or so, there weren’t even traffic lights in that intersection. It was a much smaller town when that got created.

The lane I assume you are talking about is heading from Bridge onto Nutt Rd towards Giant (Rt 23 West).

For people who aren’t native to the area, it appears to be a merge lane, but it isn’t for some reason. The traffic coming from Bridge has the Yield sign,  not the Nutt Rd traffic. So they don’t have to let you in. You are supposed to wait for a gap. Why? Who knows.

"Check out [MidLantic Urology](https://midlanticurology.com/locations/28/phoenixville). It's in the same medical complex as Phoenixville Hospital.

I can't speak to experience yet since I'm in the middle of the process, but I can say that the advantage of using them is that the procedure itself can be done in the Phoenixville Hospital main operating room by one of those urologists. So everything happens in the same medical complex.

In terms of the process, expect to have to do the following appointments: 1) referral from your PCP, 2) initial consult with the urologist, 3) pre-surgery consult with the urologist one week before the procedure, and 4) the procedure itself.

I'd recommend looking up reviews of each doctor before making a choice. I went with Dr. Oskanian, but I can't provide personal feedback since my procedure's not until mid-May. I'll try to post an update post-op.

*EDIT:* Super late follow-up, but everything went well with my procedure. I was in and out quickly, able to work a desk job the day after surgery, and almost entirely back to normal in about a week (save for avoiding lifting heavy things). Lab testing 2 months later confirmed that the procedure was fully successful.

Phoenixville is far removed from Philadelphia and I often avoid traveling there because of the traffic and commute. Having access to a rail into Philly would be a great amenity as a PXV resident.

While the economic growth would be dramatic, part of what makes Phoenixville special is it still has the small town feel.  Traffic and congestion would increase as high density housing will pop up to meet demands.

"Overpriced. When we moved out, we we're looking at $1800+ for a 1br unit. When we moved in it was $1550ish. This was between 2016-2018, maybe things have changed because of covid. Although, knowing a couple business owners in town the township/mayor don't seem to like the landlord/management of PV because they were increasing rent and not filling units. That's not great for businesses and a not good look for the town, having empty expensive apartments.

We also didn't care for the hotel feeling of the place. Little personality, faulty alarms, faulty elevators, faulty parking gates. It wasn't all the time, but frequent enough that it was kinda annoying. Quality of the unit isn't that great either, they'll keep that security deposit, good luck with those beige cheap carpets getting 100% clean. We were creek side too (great view) but in the summer it was bugs galore. 

I'm being honest about our experience. We had the money to live there but we decided to go with Independence Crossing and save for a house.

"The market is nuts. I live in a townhome and my neighbors listed their place a couple of weeks ago. We watched person after person drive up between Friday night and Sunday for tours. The following Wednesday, we got a letter in the mail from a realtor whose clients had toured the home, put in an offer 30k above asking and didnt get it. They of course sent the letter to us neighbors with a picture of the couple and how they want to be in Pville (currently in Conshy) and get married and start their family. We paused for a couple of hours and thought about selling, but then that just means we'll be paying a ridiculous amount for our next place. We decided to wait a couple of years to see what happens with the market.

"Not a realtor but did just buy my first home in the boro. I can give you my realtor if you still need one. While prices are high the interest rates are so low it balances out. I will say it is such a hot market be prepared to make an offer right away if you like the place. We toured a twin in the Boro the day it went on the market (2:00pm). We were the 2nd of SEVEN offers in a 24 hour period. We had to go above asking and we were lucky as we were the cute young couple looking for a place to start a family so really played up that emotional appeal. If you’re willing to take on a project you may have better luck. We actually did really well with our home even going $10k above asking. It was basically completely updated and no real work is needed. But a lot of the homes especially in the Boro are older and may need work so be aware of that. Our home is 121 years old and even though it doesn’t “need” work there are all sorts of weird and quirky things about it that we will eventually fix- like the doors ending 2 inches above the floor, the bathroom is an addition so the floor is like 4 inches below the kitchen, etc.",t2_70k75f4l,jlnova,0,1615127963.0,0,t1_gq3lykp,gq3lykp,True,sixers2001,t3_lzi7yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Phoenixville/comments/lzi7yq/realtors/,Realtors,/r/Phoenixville/comments/lzi7yq/realtors/gq3lykp/,2,r/Phoenixville,0,2

"I lived in both over the span of 4 years. They're very similar with some differences

* Amenity wise, they have a lot of similarities - swimming pool, gym etc. Point has a much better gym, along with a rock climbing wall if that matters to you. PV has a jacuzzi in the pool, and a theater room which is fun for movie nights etc. They both have good clubhouses etc. that can be reserved. PV used to be free but now charges for the rental... which I'm not a fan of. 
* Both are accessible to downtown so no difference there. 
* Point has a dog park, and better walking trails etc. Plus the quality of the materials used - in the cabinets etc. is much better than PV. 
* PV has multiple different floor plans - 1BR, Studio, 2BR, 2BR w/den etc. Point only has 1BR and 2BR I believe. Maybe studio, but not sure 
* Personally, I like Point better because it feels more like a ""luxury"" apartment than PV. PV is designed so that you could get an apartment that is a long walk from the elevator/garbage chute etc. I knew people who really didn't like this. Point is much better designed that way. 
* I'd give Point the edge on the quality of apartments, and build material. PV's Jazuzzi and movie theater were really nice amenities so if that matters, its worth it. Then again, Point's Rock climbing wall is also an advantage.

"If you're willing to spend $2200 on rent, just buy a house. Mortgages are quite a bit less, hell you'll pay less than $2200 if you can't make 20% down poayment. PV was ok but the cost of living there just wasn't worth it. No personality, crappy build quality, shit ton of lantern flies in the summer, gates break, fire alarms break. I'm friends with a couple business owners in town and they have said the township has approached the owner of PV to lower rent because it's never full which isn't a good look. He won't budge. 

For an apartment that size and that quality, there's no reason a single bedroom should push $2k (expenses included).

"I too had issues with my cat at Valley Vet. I was told a doctor would call me regarding different medications for anxiety that I could try and when he did call, he gave me terrible attitude and 100% judged me for wanting to know more info on the subject. Between that and the terrible wait times, I never went back. My husband still takes our dog there though, and most recently they never called us back with important test results and we had to reach out to them. Worst part is, we never got to speak to a doctor, and the vet tech said “oh, well it’s NOT ____. That’s the only thing we tested for”. Thdy never told us what the issue was (my dog had high enzime levels in his one kidney), only ruled out one thing so we don’t know what/if there is anything possibly wrong.

Also, they’ve done an amazing job with covid. They have you wait in your car and come get your pet (with both people wearing masks).

Sheesh I’m sorry to hear that. Only had one issue with them once like that but it was a much less serious condition. I could tell my puppy had a UTI. My old dog used to get them all the time and I could spot it quickly from her behavior and potty habits. So I noticed this with my new puppy. I insisted he had it and they did not agree. Finally got them to test it and I was right. BUT...other than that I’ve had good experiences with them.

"I went to them for my dog for several years. We raised a concern about his heart seeming to beat very rapidly after playing and they tld me not to worry about it. Years pass. Problem persists, brought him again. Not a problem, don't worry about it. Brought him a third time: Oh wow, you should take him to a fucking dog cardiologist.
