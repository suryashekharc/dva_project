"CBC Marketplace just did a 30 minute program on modern auto theft and how easy it is to steal any vehicle.

Basically, there's the relay attack method which works well but can be blocked with proper prevention - like a Faraday cage.

More so though, they don't even really need to do the relay attack on most cars anymore. It's even easier than that. They pick your car door lock in seconds, and once in hook up a key programmer to your OBD2 port and tell the car to accept their new key they have with them. Then they simply drive off.

Not much you can really do about unfortunately. It really sucks.

One woman even had a club on her steering wheel and they picked the lock and removed it easily.",t2_dd2mg,Shorts365,0,1648425885.0,0,t1_i2dkdb7,i2dkdb7,True,[deleted],t3_tpvnrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/burnaby/comments/tpvnrl/man_broken_into_my_car_last_night_like_he_got_the/,Man broken into my car last night like he got the keys,/r/burnaby/comments/tpvnrl/man_broken_into_my_car_last_night_like_he_got_the/i2dkdb7/,11,r/burnaby,0,11

"Great investment and entertainment district albeit you may have to cough up more $$$ on the services provided around that area. The stores/shops are more expensive than Metrotown. 

Is it great for family? We don't know yet until the community center is built (maybe 5-10 years?)

Metrotown is far more established and more walkable. 

You have Bonsor and Edmond Community Center reachable by walk/bus+skytrain (yes, I know it's old but facility wise, it's ""good enough"" / ""complete""). 

You have more Elementary schools around Metrotown. More business options (insurance, restaurants, health-related, groceries, big chains).

Edmonds is a good compromise: small town-ish but 2 stations away from Metrotown. There are quite a few smaller groceries around Edmonds and the Edmonds Community center is great!

"If you want a more quiet and relaxing place I recommend around Edmonds area or high gate. Highgate seems a nice area there is a mini mall nearly by and I think the pricing is still cheaper but have lots of potential once more developers start developing in that area.

As of right now apartment near metrotown and Brentwood is through the roof 2 bedroom apartment over 900k? One bedroom over 600k? Not really worth the price IMO. Rent is also high in those area. If you are going between Van and coq you can also look at lougheed mall.

Edit depends on your life style. I used to love living near metrotown for like 6months and then hate it. Sure there is a mall, a community center and a ton of restaurant nearby but is  Too busy, too many people, too much traffic, even skytrain is packed and there is hardly any street parking.

Brentwood is more 25-30 age group. Groceries are I’ll be more expensive since it’s Whole Foods and save on. Food options are also not that good.

"I lived at Brentwood and Metrotown and the only reason I'd suggest Brentwood for you is because it's by the highway making it easier to commute. However, I still prefer Metrotown because Brentwood felt so much noisier and busy (in a bad way) because of Lougheed traffic and the constant buzz of the highway. There's a ton of air pollution from the highway traffic you can't see until you clean your balcony and there's a constant layer of dirt and dust. Although I lived at Gilmore it felt like I still needed a car to get around. At metrotown you can walk everywhere and it is getting more pedestrian friendly as more condos get built. Lots of new restaurants popping up, especially at Station Square. There's a lot more different things to do (there's only so many times you can go to Brentwood mall) and although people say it's all old people and kids I have to disagree.

"The area is changing rapidly. I'd check the plans on the Burnaby web site. 

It's the most ethnically diverse community in Canada, which is saying something. I've lived here all but one year of the last 25 and I love it. It's walkable, heavily treed, well served with transit and has just about everything you need to run a household or enjoy recreation or get an education close by. I've been lucky with my neighbours (There's a lot of rentals on my street but these folks are awesome). 

Parking is a bit of a drag depending on the street and there's quite a bit of petty theft - bikes going missing from yards, weirdos looking from yard to yard. If I was moving into the area I would definitely put security cameras over the entrances and garage, if applicable, or pointing at the car. (My brother's car was stolen from the carport about ten years ago and apart from the new crack pipe in the footwell he got it back in one piece.) 

There's occasionally noise from night filming down on Marine Drive (BOOM! at 2 am, what the hell was that), and sometimes you can hear the foghorns and train horns down by the Fraser, but it's a relatively quiet neighbourhood.

"Well, it seems that you are missing my point. 
I am more than familiar with everything about the Burnaby Mountain. It’s our backyard. We are not discussing the Playground of the Gods, which is related to the carver Toko (some history bellow) but the new name of the Horizon restaurant. 
As a person of non -Aboriginal decent, who has a huge respect for our Aboriginal people and their sacred sites such as the Medicine Wheel site on Burnaby Mountain, I think that the new restaurant’s name is not appropriate. That’s all. 


“ The surprising thing about the Playground of the Gods (known in Japanese as Kamui Mintara) is that, in general, many folks automatically think that the First Nations people carved the totem poles. Although there are some similarities in the workmanship and symbols, the woodcarver is, in fact, a Japanese man named Nuburi Toko.

Toko is an Ainu people—an indigenous tribe from northern Japan.

"My former upstairs neighbour would do dishes and run kitchen equipment and all sorts of other crap between 11pm and 2am on a regular basis.

I filed noise complaints on 4 occasions. When she had lived there for just under 2 years, she listed her place.

This is where it gets interesting:

One day I was riding down in the elevator with her and her dog. I petted the dog's head. As I go to get off, she cut in front of me and said I was the reason she had to sell and referenced a noise complaint that wasn't even one I made (she'd also gotten in trouble for garbage in the hall, dog poop on the balcony). I ducked past her and she followed me to my car screaming and yelling. I was so scared she would attack me.

"Well, let's see what the numbers say.

Let's use a subset of crimes that people seem focused on: Assault, Robbery, B&E.

Burnaby had: 
* 1006 Assaults, or 404 per 100k, down 13% from 2020
* 75 Robberies, or 30 per 100k, down 23% from 2020
* 854 B&Es, or 343 per 100k, down 39% from 2020.

Vancouver had:
* 4608 Assaults, or 682 per 100k, up 2% from 2020*
* 568 Robberies, or 84 per 100k, down 5% from 2020
* 3512 B&Es, or 520 per 100k, down 27% from 2020

So the answer is that at their current rates Burnaby will never have as much crime as Vancouver, but that's because crime rate isn't increasing in either city.

\* Note that this is still down from 2019. Most likely because with fewer people walking around outside during the pandemic - and thus fewer targets of assault - the 2020 numbers were abnormally low.",t2_3cz6m,bobdobbsisdead,0,1646440374.0,0,t1_hze1ky2,hze1ky2,True,noutopasokon,t3_t6wc1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/burnaby/comments/t6wc1n/how_long_until_burnaby_falls_to_vancouver_levels/,How long until Burnaby falls to Vancouver levels of crime and such?,/r/burnaby/comments/t6wc1n/how_long_until_burnaby_falls_to_vancouver_levels/hze1ky2/,15,r/burnaby,0,15

"Bears do not live in Deer Lake Park. Deer Lake Park has some food sources for them and they come through seasonally. Pay very close attention to the dogs around you, if there's a bear they will LET YOU KNOW. I have seen coyotes, seen precisely one  bobcat (lynx) and I spoke to someone who had just seen a three hundred pound bear, who climbed the railing of the walkway, bellyflopped into the lake and swam away to avoid people.

I have no problem walking around the park at night, and in the summer time that is how you see bats and owls. However, I don't walk alone, I walk with one other person.

My favourite part park is the raised walkway in the middle of the park at the west end of the lake, where there are very often frogs. There's also a snake den on one of the trails and if you're standing in the exact right spot on the first truly warm day in the spring you'll see the garter snakes come out and have a mass orgy.

"not sure what your self defence goals are but you may as well enrol into any of the above and go at minimum 3 times a week. one on one instruction doesn’t get you that far as your trainer can’t spar with you or “pressure test” you in the same way as sparring with different people (more and less comfortable and familiar with, and different body shapes and sizes, etc). the cost of a month’s membership is the same (ish! - don’t roast me too hard internet) as a single hour one on one.  alternatively, if you can find instructors/coaches who have the time… (if they don’t have a full time gym that is busy), consider getting some of your friends to do some kind of group session if you want to get a lower student to teacher ratio.

i also want to be clear about “getting you that far”. a one on one limits that instructor’s ability to watch you perform and do what they’re supposed to do to help you improve: coach. so… i mean the ecosystem of a lot of gyms allow for this as you spar with others, instructors can watch and provide feedback. especially if you request it. 

that’s my two cents on “one on one”.

to address that part about 1 on 1 bjj. i think 1 on 1 helps to learn techniques and deeper understanding of stuff. but you gotta try that on a variety of different people (sizes, skills, social familiarity, etc). so much of it is feel… this applies to every martial art really.

in bjj i suppose you could accost a purple belt and buy them dinner and fancy things to do one on ones 🤷🏽‍♂️. 

earlier covid times created a larger market/supply of personal trainers for that stuff i think… and others that i’d think of have gone to running/teaching at a gym or don’t have time for that side hustle due to life (married, career, kids, etc).

"•There were bear sightings; have never heard or seen any bear dens around. There are two coyotes; they usually come out at dusk. If you are walking, would highly recommend a head lamp. It scares them away. 

• Walking at night? That’s your call. It’s safe or unsafe as anywhere else. Quiet neighborhood does not guarantee you any safety. 

• Baldwin House seems to be accessible to public since there are visitors on a regular basis. 

https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=2357

• Favourite areas; gardens, Art Gallery, and kayaking (short distance but pleasant recreation after a work day). There is a rental place if you don’t have your own kayak. Burnaby lake is much better; it has a beautiful 2km stretch one way. 
Shadbolt Centre used to host lots of arts/crafts exhibitions, which unfortunately is not the case anymore. 

• Festivals: Symphony in the park, Jazz festival, Lantern Festival …this also has changed due to the Covid R&R.

"Burnaby is pretty big, so if you specify your area you might get more tailored responses.  In North Burnaby you have Confederation Park with pool, library, skatebowl, rubber walking/running track, water park, dog park, forest... basically everything :D.  Restaurants around there include Ramen Gaoh, Uomo Sushi, Glenburn Soda Fountain, and of course Anton's, plus some Thai places.  I have to shout out Mountain Gems (a rock/gem store) and Muck About gift gallery for being very homey and welcoming with nice original and affordable gifts.  You'll also find Rocky's meats and Coiffe's independent delis.

Go south a few minutes and find the ""Amazing"" Brentwood, which has some good stores and is near Whole Foods, a good bubble tea place (Coco, I think), and what looks to be a popular Korean BBQ and a Vietnamese restaurant (but I'm too old or too busy putting kids to bed at the times I would want to visit those places).

Capital Hill has a nice park with a sunset view on the west side, and same with Horizon's park on BBY Mountain.  Some OK mountain biking down BBY Mountain as well, plus walking trails there.  The park across from Home Depot is very under used and in the summer evenings you can almost always find garter snakes at the edge of the grass.

"I've lived in Burnaby for 20+ years - this is how I'd rank it from best to worst in terms of quietness/livability:

- Buckingham heights.
- Deer lake. 
- Garden Village.
- Suncrest/Southslope/Area next to Burnaby South.
- Metrotown/Maywood.
- Edmonds/Highgate.

I agree with /u/Alternative-Tear-296 that South Burnaby > North Burnaby for the same reasons. I'm really not a fan of Edmonds, having lived there for 2 years. I lived in the 'nicer' part of Edmonds too, at the Bosa properties behind Tommy Douglas Library. You often hear people screaming in the middle of the night outside - whether its fighting or mental illness. Also, its not particularly convenient - the food selection isn't great/restaurants aren't good and the major grocery store you can walk to is Save-on/Buy-Low which isn't as cheap as Superstore/Wal-Mart. 

If you want convenience, I would just live in the various towers next to Metrotown. Be warned, the units in the newer buildings are smaller. The only new building I would avoid is Element unless you're renting. In general the restaurants beside Metrotown are bigger brands/more well-known so the quality is more consistent (service/food). Also, the grocery choices are better.

I live in Edmonds currently, although I love it and have no issues with it, some people tend to not like the area as much.

I live in the heart of Edmonds and what possibly could be the “hood” of it, however last time there was a vehicle brake in in our neighborhood was over years ago so its not that bad honestly.

The best thing everyone can do is set a positive example. The easiest and most practical solution is if Burnaby had a community of citizens who didn't litter in the first place.

The City of Burnaby has a program where they provide tongs and other equipment to help with picking up litter. They still haven't created the dedicated web page they promised after my presentation back in September. I will call them later today to get a web address or contact details.
