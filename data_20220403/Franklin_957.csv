"First, I would ask if you knew for a fact that he was arrested or just asked to leave the area.   Did you witness the act?  Second, ordinances for public nuisance have been in place in nearly every town in the USA.  I imagine that we have those ordinances and that his actions violated the conditions of the ordinance.  

Public nuisance incidents happen all the time but are only acted upon if someone reports them.  Case in point... last Sunday a man was playing his violin (rather loudly) in the parking lot of Whole Foods.  I considered him a nuisance, but I did not report him, so nothing became of it.

Chances are, a local business owner reported the incident to the Police.  They investigated and asked the person to leave.  I imagine the person left voluntarily, otherwise a scuffle would have ensured, and THEN he would have been arrested.  Ordinance violations are not law violations.

I agree with you, this man is doing the Lord's work and trying his best to warn us of our sins.  He's just a bit over zealous in his execution.  Then again.. so to did Paul yell at others about their sins.

"Lived here in Williamson Co. the second time since 2013.  First was 1975 - the day I was born - until 2000.  Work is in Murfreesboro so I lived there until my dad couldn't care for himself, and moved back in with him. 

We had 4 high schools when I graduated (1993).  My class had 160 students or so.  Rich kids went to Brentwood, melting pot was Franklin, the country kids went to Page, and the realllly country kids went to Fairview.  Four elementary schools fed Page - Trinity, Bethesda (go Dragons), Nolensville, and College Grove. 

We used to cruise the square - drive Columbia Ave. to where the Domino's and Pizza Hut were (torn down to supposedly save battlefield property, while the Kroger, Chilis, Chick-fil-A, and Target literally covered the campsites) - then back down around the square.  We never caused trouble but were deemed a public nuisance and banned. 

I worked at HG Hill's - back when Mr. Hill was still alive, and we didn't sell beer and were closed on Sunday.

I never went to the Globe or the D&T or the Black Eyed Susie Saloon... woulda gotten whipped!

This city tore down a really cool Frank Lloyd Wright - designed tractor dealership to build a damned stupid looking, looming, police headquarters that sits right on the road.  The first chain restaurant - Dairy Queen on Columbia Ave., - long gone.

"It was about 1-2 on a weekday, I want to say I was heading to Chattanooga for a work trip. Could’ve been lunch traffic but it was something I’ve never seen before. Usually anytime from 3-5 it’s backed up from Mack Hatcher to downtown. 

Yeah murfreesboro rd is 96, easier to say. I don’t know some of the other terminology because to me it just comes second nature. If you haven’t been The coffee house has really good coffee, my favorite. Meridees is pretty good for a light lunch too.

I completely understand too with the companies using franklin addresses. I’ve noticed a lot of companies are starting to do that. Granted there are large corporate office buildings off Carothers but one of my buddies plays 2K the basketball game and if you choose to relocate a franchise to Nashville their suburb option is a picture of Downtown Franklin. So I thought that was pretty neat. The Miami Marlins even had a commercial while a ball game was on and was talking about supporting their city and were showing famous Miami landmarks and then for some reason showed downtown Franklin in the middle of it , I had to pause to double check and sure enough it had the square with the Grey’s sign.

"That’s kind of a bummer to hear. I visited Nashville a few years ago before COVID and really liked that it had its own identity and was juuust big enough without being too big of a city. From what I’ve read I was hoping Franklin would be the same, but on a smaller more intimate scale but it sounds like it’s succumbed to the big box retailization that most people dread about suburbia. Makes me wonder why people move to a town when they just want the same corporate comforts of wherever they came from. I guess the same has happened a lot even in Manhattan which is a large part of why I’m not feeling too bad about eventually leaving NYC. 

The thing with waving to neighbors who you don’t know is definitely a southern thing. My in-laws waved to every car we walked by in their Mississippi suburban subdivision. Tripped me out. I asked them if they knew the other person the first few times. Definitely feels weird to do it but like we said, when in Rome. 

As for acting like they own the place, I feel like there’s a large contingency of millennials that only understand the social cues of social media. Again I thought they’d only be flocking to Nashville for the ‘gram but it sounds like the word is out on Franklin. I’ve read that Amazon, Oracle, and other large tech companies have found that a Franklin address is a great recruiting tool so there’s probably no stopping the city’s reversion to the mean now.

Everywhere has traffic. Literally nearly everywhere is congested. It takes me 30-35 mins to go 7 miles, downtown Franklin heading towards 65 on 96 it took me 35 minutes to go 2 miles from the coffee house to the church right before Mack Hatcher.

"Before you knew majority of people. When you waved they waved back, when you looked you greeted each other. If you’re a pedestrian you didn’t just walk out in front of Cars like you own the place. You don’t throw trash on the ground, you throw it away. You didn’t sit there and complain about the southern culture and how much better this or that was where you were from. People were happier and friendlier. I think people should learn a little bit about the south, the history and area where they’re moving to fully understand and respect the place. To fully understand the culture and where the native people come from. Franklin is a historic town with A LOT of history and for people just to know nothing about it and treat it like another city seems disrespectful. We support our local businesses and didn’t live here just to say we live in Franklin and williamson county or use it as status. We live here because we love the area, history, people, we grew up here, we support each other, etc.

People move here in the snap of the finger, know nothing about the culture or history, run straight to their Whole Foods and Lululemon, Trader Joe’s, Starbucks, rather than supporting the local businesses. Act like snobs and like they’re the greatest people around. Throw trash anywhere and everywhere. Try to push their own ideology on schools etc. It’s just sad to see. I mean even going to the mall or other businesses in cool springs hearing how much their thefts and petty theft is increasing is just getting ridiculous.

"Check out Retreat at Iron Horse (1000 Iron Horse Lane, 37069). The rent is very reasonable and there are many floor plans to choose from, some with garages and storage units. I don’t know the current availability. The grounds and other amenities (pool, club house, gym, etc.) are well kept,  and the staff there are super nice and helpful. The residents here are generally very nice and quiet - we wake up to the sound of birds chirping every morning (granted we’ve only lived here for two months). And while this is a very dog-friendly apartment complex, you hardly ever hear any barking. It’s like all the dogs, big and small, have made an agreement to be chill. If you need extra storage, Cool Springs Self Storage on Mallory Station Road is nearby (Tammy who works there most of the time is awesome). All the shops and restaurants in Cool Springs are a five minute drive, if you manage to avoid Mallory Lane during traffic hours which is doable. The only thing I don’t like about Retreat at Iron Horse is the parking situation. If you lived in one of the larger buildings that don’t come with garages, then there’s no assigned parking bays. However there are plenty of parking available. You just don’t get your own spot.

Edit: actually there’s something worse than the parking situation but it’s totally avoidable at Iron Horse. They have these blinding sconces on the exterior walls and one of them is right next to my bedroom window. It keeps my bedroom brightly lit at night.

"I just completed a 45 day stay at the Life Center of Galax, VA. The conditions were horrendous. The facility had no COVID test when an outbreak began. 60+ people tested positive in the first wave of testing (conducted by the local Health department) and were told they had to leave immediately. It was around Midnight on Tuesday August 24th 2021 that the facility loaded up the 4, 16-passenger vans and dropped off those patients who did not have someone pick them up. Many of them did not have a dollar to their names or a place to go to. So ACADIA HEALTH (Nasdaq: ACHC) dropped them at the address on their insurance policy. Many went homeless and back to drugs as they left with no plan and no MAT.

"Planning way ahead, I see! 

**Scenery:**  

* [Natchez Trace Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez_Trace_Parkway_Bridge) (I'd say go eat at Loveless Cafe while you're there, but I'm honestly not sure they have anything vegan on the menu.)
* **Historic homes and properties:** You might laugh at our idea of ""historic"" being 200 years old, but you can tour Carnton Plantation, Lotz house, and Carter house. All civil war era homes. Carnton was used as a field hospital- can still see blood stains on the floor! You can also walk around what's left of Fort Granger for free in Franklin next to Pinkerton Park for free. Nice hilltop! 
* [Arrington Vineyard](https://www.arringtonvineyards.com/)
* **Hikes:** Percy Warner Park is by far the best the city has to offer, but it's in Nashville. In Franklin you can find [Marcella Vivrette Smith park](https://www.brentwoodtn.gov/departments/parks-recreation/parks-trails-greenways/marcella-vivrette-smith-park), [Pinkerton Park](https://visitfranklin.com/see-and-do/pinkerton-park), and [The Park at Harlinsdale Farm](https://www.franklintn.gov/government/departments-k-z/parks/park-locations/the-park-at-harlinsdale-farm). Harlinsdale and Pinkerton have river access if you'd like to sit and watch the water for a bit. 
* Honestly, it would be cheaper for you to rent a car for a day or two to see some of these places than to take uber/lyft, or make your friend drive you. You're going to run up a hell of a tab if you're going back and forth to Nashville. Just know that Franklin has way fewer drivers and it could take you awhile 10-15 mins just to get matched with a driver depending on the time. Build that time in if you're on a schedule. Also, commuting traffic is horrible. Avoid going to Nashville between 7-9am and 4-6pm. 

**Hangout spots:** 

* [Frothy Monkey](https://frothymonkey.com/location/dwtn-franklin/)\- coffee shop and cafe in an old home. 
* [The Factory](https://factoryatfranklin.com/)\- old oven factory converted into offices, restaurants, and shops. There's a large common area where you can sit, or if you need a less conspicuous place I'd recommend Honest Coffee. Try the Franklin Juice Co. Acai bom bom bowl while you're there. 
* [Just Love Coffee](https://justlovecoffeecafe.com/mcewen/) \- Newer spot with a courtyard area outside.
* Need a coworking space for the day? Check out The Lodge, eSpaces, or Spaces. Each should have a day pass for around $20.

**Live music:** Check out Puckett's and Kimbro's Pickin' Parlor on Tuesdays. Most of the music scene is up in Nashville. Franklin is more families and kind of shuts down around 8pm. 

**Food:** Just know there will be slim pickings for vegan options. Animal products in ALL THE THINGS. These places have some vegan otpions: 

* House of India
* Vui's Kitchen
* Mellow Mushroom pizza
* Juice Bar 
* Franklin Juice Co
* Tazikis
* Greek Cafe Grill
* Herban Market
* Core Life Eatery

"* Traffic: I find it best to jump on 65 to go in and out of cool springs. Mallory goes all the way through but can be nuts. Getting on 65 for just 1 exit up can sometimes be faster. Around Thanksgiving, cool springs traffic on Mallory by the mall will be stop and go because of mall shoppers getting Christmas presents. Go around, not through.
* Grocery: Trader Joe's is coming in soon! Ever been to Aldi? It's cheap groceries. You're welcome. Right across from Costco. There's also a Kroger and Whole Foods.If you haven't yet, please get vaccinated! Walgreens on Mallory/Cool Springs is prob the closest pharmacy, if not the Kroger pharmacy on Mallory.
* Fav local Franklin/Cool Springs Restaurants: Yats, Ground, Vui's Kitchen, Pasta and Cream, Mojo's, House of India
* Kids: Lots of music, dance, cheer, and gymnastics place, plus daycares on Seaboard Ln.
* Need a coworking space? Spaces is off Mallory, ESpaces is just by Whole Foods.
* Culture: A difficult mix of ultra right and ultra left with some tired middle of the roaders. From my experience, Very few people are actually from here. Most people have not lived here prior to 2015.
* Downtown Franklin is cute! Fun to walk around, shop. The Factory gets talked up a lot, but many visitors find it meh. It's shops and a few eateries. Keep an eye on Visit Franklin for local festivals, events, fairs, movie in the park, etc.
* Like coffee? Try Honest, Frothy Monkey, and the Coffee House at Second and Bridge.
* Like tea? Try Frothy or Triple Crown Bakery.
* It can be lonely when you first get here. Many people are friendly! Just keep getting out there to meet people so you don't go insane and get depressed. There are networking groups on FB.
* Weather: Follow Nashville Severe Weather on their blog and twitter for very good weather updates. They're better than the news. You'll want to get a weather radio or app that wakes you up as we get tornadoes (mostly in the Spring) and flash flooding.Winter: It rains here. A lot. Rain shoes are a must. It also gets super cloudy and kinda depressing. Get a happy lamp if you struggled with SAD on the east coast. You probably already have a good winter coat.
* Fav nearby parks: Pinkerton, Harlinsdale Farm, Marcella Vivrette Smith Park, Preservation Park. 
* Welcome home!

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"Franklin definitely worth considering... if you can get in! Housing market is insane if you're trying to buy.   


Affordable is a relative term. The apartments in Franklin are on par with the rest on Nashville.  What kind of apartment/amenities are you interested in?   


Commute is a little iffy right now. It's far less traffic-y than normal because more people than ever are working remotely, but I have a feeling the traffic will return in full force in a year or so- if not only for better public health, but for increased growth/volume, too. Commute can be delayed in Nolensville as it's another high-growth area with a lot of 2 lane roads. There are a few spots out there that are still stop signs and it can take a looong time to cross an intersection during the morning and evening rush hours.

**Things a boomer might like about Franklin:**

* Lots of historical sites from civil-war era. Houses, plantation, battlefields, etc. 
* Many local restaurants and a decent selection of national chains
* Parks, green spaces, and walkways. Like fishing? There's a few spots around! The harpeth river goes right through town.
* Live music (it will return more!) - Kimbro's, Puckett's, Zoe's are the three that come to mind that have music right now. 
* Shopping- local boutiques for unique gifts and a larger mall in Cool Springs
* Costco!!!! 
* Local orgs for volunteering and such- Historical society, Chamber, Rotary. 
* If you're a Christian, there is no shortage of churches to pick from
* Arrington vineyards is close by
* Lots of street festivals in Franklin (or there will be post-covid). Main street fest, Pumpkin fest, Dickens of a Christmas, Tree Lighting ceremony, Independence Day, etc.)
* Many healthcare locations. Nashville's a big healthcare center, and Franklin has it, too. No need to drive far for healthcare! There are numerous clinics, specialty places, in-patient and out-patient offices. Williamson county is a great hospital. There's quite a few Vanderbilt offices around.",t2_4n05b41u,permafacepalm,0,1619538148.0,0,t1_gw28h78,gw28h78,True,Lisk56,t3_mzh6h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FranklinTN/comments/mzh6h8/commute_to_nolensville/,Commute to Nolensville,/r/FranklinTN/comments/mzh6h8/commute_to_nolensville/gw28h78/,4,r/FranklinTN,0,4
"Nolensville, Arrington, and College Grove are all worthy contenders if you're interested in something less urban and close to where you'll be working.

Franklin is nice, the downtown area is highly walkable and has some nice shopping and eating.  Depending on which side you live on vs where you're trying to go traffic can be a pain during rush hour.

I feel like franklin is more affordable than brentwood.  In mind Brentwood is office parks and super expensive houses.  They used to not allow apartments in brentwood, but I'm not sure if this has changed over the years.  There are definitely apartments in franklin.

Rent is stupidly expensive here.  A friend of mine is paying $1,800/month for a 2 bedroom apartment.

Edit: the commute from either location to Nolensville is around 30 minutes.

"First impression: very kind people here, everyone has been very friendly. I moved here from Arizona, having lived in Chicago before that, and the people here have been the most friendly. Great restaurants, lots of outdoor activities available. 
If you’re used to a big city, Franklin is NOT that. Definitely a family town, great for kids I imagine (I don’t have any). But it’s about 25 min out from Nashville! So the opportunity for “big city” things is right there. I liked that I’m not IN the city but still have an easy option to be. 
Not super diverse and it’s definitely not culturally unique in my opinion (at least not compared to Chicago). 
The weather has been so beautiful and awesome, I’ve noticed a lot of people complain about the weather on other Tennessee Reddit pages but coming from the desert heat that is Arizona or the wind tunnel of Chicago—I think it’s been beautiful.

You would be crazy for Hendersonville. Yeah, it's the ""wrong way"" of main commuter traffic, but it doesn't matter. That's a long-ass drive on a stretch that is often backed up with accidents. 

Bellevue to Franklin is not direct. Most of the time you'd have to go north first to 440, then south on 65. Side streets through Green Hills won't be faster than 440. Green Hills is very heavy in traffic all day.

Mt. Juliet/Hermitage: You'd have to get on/off 440 daily which is a terrible life experience. 

If you're going to commute, why not look at other areas? Murfreesboro, Mt. Pleasant, Columbia, Fairview? (I'd veer you south over north). Also consider life stage.

"Hello. I live in Franklin, but I've lived in Spring Hill before. Personally, I would go with Spring Hill, but be warned that the traffic is especially horrible on weekends.

Ironically, you mention Hendersonville - when I lived in Spring Hill, I was commuting to Gallatin. Took about an hour to get there in the morning and an hour and a half to get back after work- this was 10 years ago though.

"Go to our parks!

The Park at Harlinsdale. Gorgeous little hike and dog park. Great spot for pictures. Also the location of Pilgrimmage Fest-- albeit it's never been as good as their first year, shame. 

Jim Warren Park is great for kids. Lots of amenities and a skate park too. 

Percy Warner Park is my favorite for hiking... North of Brentwood. Further drive but it's huge!

Honestly... check out Facebook marketplace. Keep an eye on it for a few weeks and you'll find something! Franklin is a very wealthy area and people get rid of brand new stuff just because they're redecorating.

"Picky ownership. High rent. There used to be this (honestly, just ""ok"") cafe across from 5 Daughters where they'd have live music. It was a nice ambiance! People think the factory is this great destination, but it's honestly never been that spectacular. I don't know why people put it on ""things to do in Franklin"" lists. If there were more history info and plaques about the factory it'd be a bit more interesting.

I personally think the factory would be an AMAZING cafeteria. IT's basically halfway there with all the eateries they have... Put a few more fast casual restaurants and to-go counters in there a la NYC and Atlanta's Krog Street Market and the few retails stores will be ok!  


\*edit There are actually quite a few offices and non-retail businesses in there.

"Farmers Market is the main event. The factory has been busy in years past but several factors work against it. The Square has been blowing up for awhile so most businesses focus on that area.

"Just an opinion from someone who moved to franklin last year; you can find decently priced housing here if you look really hard. I’m in a pretty nice apartment (wood floors, up to date appliances, two bedroom) for a little over $1000 a month, and I’m just a few minutes from downtown franklin. 

If you’re the outdoorsy type, there’s several really nice parks in the Franklin/Brentwood/Nashville area. Beaman Park, Percy Warner Park, and Radnor Lake are all great for hiking. 

There’s also a lot of great food downtown, along with a couple of cute shops that mostly tailor to the wealthier day tourists, haha.

"I mean... I don't know how anyone can give you any real guidance based on what you've said so far. You haven't mentioned a budget and your lifestyle comment leaves a whole lot of gray area.

If you're coming in early and leaving late everyday then you're going to beat a lot of the commute period in particular if you live in Nashville your reverse commuting and it shouldn't be so bad. If you choose spring Hill you'll be commuting with everybody else and traffic will be worse.

There are plenty of young people that are active in Franklin and there are plenty of young people that are active in Nashville and there are plenty of young people that are active in East nashville. It's almost more of a vibe and thus hard to say which vibe you would fit in better with.

If you want to see more green trees and less city life and try to stick near Franklin but maybe head east or west a little bit to reduce cost.

Me personally, I despise a commute and will pay more money to reduce that commute time. There are some condos near whole foods in Franklin that might be right up your alley.

"It's in Rutherford County mostly.  I think some of the property may front New Castle Rd. near Mike Freeman's outfit (the castle).  It's right beside 840.  Looks to be a high end facility.

I'm not opposed or in favor of it, but 840 is never quiet.  It's a ruination of my quality of life. The track / facility noise won't bother any neighbors.... they already have no peace and quiet.
