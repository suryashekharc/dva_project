"I wasn't going to \*not\* ask the dentist to smooth out the filling when I see him in two days (though I can see how my poor phrasing would make you think that). I already went back to him the day after the filling because the initial filling job made the retainer way too tight. (The current tightness is minor enough that I can wait for it.) I'm just not sure how much smoothing can be done before the dental people and I stop being able to tell where the too-tight areas are. And I wasn't going to \*demand\* that the orthodontist make me a new retainer; if they checked and felt that a new retainer isn't necessary, I'd be perfectly fine with that. Probably even feel relieved that I won't have to gag on the mold again or go back to braces.

Besides, at the very least, it'd be better for me to find an orthodontist that can do retainers now, when I'm \*not\* in urgent need, than to wait until something happens, like my retainer breaking, and spend days or weeks worrying while looking for an orthodontist and\\or waiting for an appointment and potentially ending up going to a doctor that I shouldn't be going to or that'll waste my time just because they had the soonest availability.",t2_3m82w46v,Queenofdragons6,0,1649006100.0,0,t1_i38tc27,i38tc27,False,Queenofdragons6,t3_tuycwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tuycwm/looking_for_orthodontists_in_columbus_that_accept/,Looking for orthodontists in Columbus that accept Medicaid or Delta insurance,/r/Columbus/comments/tuycwm/looking_for_orthodontists_in_columbus_that_accept/i38tc27/,1,r/Columbus,0,1

> 
> NEW YORK (VINnews) — A security guard at the Columbus Torah Academy in Ohio was arrested this week by local police after making anti-Semitic threats online against the school.

> 
> Thomas Develin, 24, of the Northwest Side, was arrested Wednesday. Develin had posted a photo of himself on social media site Discord holding a gun with the message “I’m at a Jewish school and about to make it everyone’s problem.” He also posted about wanting to shoot the parents picking up their children from school. A second photo was captioned: “The playground is about to turn into a self defense situation.”
> 
> Police were alerted to the post and arrested Develin for his threats. He is currently being held in the Franklin County jail.
> 
> Joel Marcovitch, CEO of JewishColumbus, the local federation arm and JewishColumbus board chair Audrey Tuckerman issued a press release on Thursday calling Develin’s threat “an act of anti-Semitism.”
> 
> “It was a cowardly act of intimidation. It was an attempt to silence our Jewish beliefs. For far too, long Jews have been mentally and physically intimidated online, at schools, universities,” they said. “Virulent anti-Semitic rhetoric breeds extremism and has no place in our community.”
> 
> Speaking to JNS on Friday, Marcovitch said that the school was notified by law enforcement a few days ago about the threat and were able to immediately convene representatives from the local day schools, preschools and synagogues to discuss the situation, as well as determining the communal response.
> 
> “What I’ve been telling people is that ‘yes, the guard was part of a company that was hired by the school, however, the systems we have in place, the partnership we have with law enforcement worked this time,’ ” he said, adding that the relationships that local officials have with the Jewish community were critical in this instance.
> 
> Marcovitch added that the school would now be relying on local police for security instead of private security guards. The move is intended to reassure parents, who had expressed their fears after Develin’s threats were publicized.
> 
> “For a security guard at a Jewish school to allegedly make deadly, terroristic threats is unthinkable. First and foremost, we are thankful that no lives were taken,” said a post on Twitter from the regional office of the Anti-Defamation League. “This is yet another sobering reminder that anti-Semitism left unchecked breeds extremism and violence. Anti-Semitism has no place in Columbus, Ohio, or anywhere.”

"They have fiber to the node where I am. I tried it once a couple years ago. The installer completely made up the answers to all my technical questions. I was ready to remove it before he was out of my driveway. I gave it the weekend and found it couldn't keep up decent video quality on any streaming service. Maybe it has improved since then but my real problem with it was that they control everything and use old tech. Gigabit was standard even for home networking at the time but they didn't have it. There was no way to use my own router without a double NAT. If you like to have control of your own network, they are not the ISP for you. No gigabit, no custom DNS, no custom DHCP. I never got as far as trying to change the wifi key but in my time doing on-site computer service, I never found anyone with a custom key on AT&T. 

On top of that, they told me they would only bill for the three days I had it, then they billed me for a whole month and told me month after month that the refund was on the way. I ended up using a credit card dispute to get the whole charge reversed.

The township roads were wet and lightly muddy due to the Intermittent rain throughout the day. Some sections were soft and slippery yet nobody got stuck.

The quarry provided the limestone for several iconic buildings around Columbus, including the Ohio Statehouse. There is still an active quarry on the property, in addition to the many phases of the park build.
> 
> Park officials are hopeful that the climbing wall will be completed this year. In the meantime, if you’d like to get a good view of the climbing area, you can always take the Tall Wall Trail, which runs right alongside the climbing area and also along the ridge above.

"If you want to ride often without traveling far from your home, consider road. You can find a do-it-all gravel if you want. Or go with an endurance bike if you want to go long distances comfortably.

However, the MTB tails in and around Columbus are a ton of fun. Alum Creek trails are great. Canal Winchester has a good trail. Mohican is a blast up north and Caesar’s Creek is fun down S/W. I ride MTB, road, and gravel, so you do have options. If you want true gravel, you could be looking at traveling just as far to ride gravel as you would travel to ride the MTB trails. Road biking is the most accessible in the Columbus area, though.

I ride road the most. I frequently ride through downtown because riding into the Arena District or around the Scioto Mile is fun. On longer rides I can ride to Xenia, Yellowsprings, Dayton, or Cincinnati depending on my motivation, and length of time I want to dedicate to the ride. To get to the other cities aforementioned from Columbus using the trails, you’ll be riding to Xenia and then branching off to go to the others. To get to Xenia it’s ~50/60 miles depending on where you’re starting. The farmland can get boring on those rides, but sometimes it catches you right and the planted fields are beautiful. I would ride MTB and gravel more, but work and weather often interfere with my available time. So I ride road the most on the trails/rails to trails. I have a Fuji SL, Trek Checkpoint and a Trek Fuel EX. (I’ve given Trek a lot of my money). And I alternate between the SL and Checkpoint the most.",t2_2qo2aw80,brempt14,0,1648988927.0,0,t1_i37silh,i37silh,True,DavidDoj0,t3_tuvtyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tuvtyv/what_kind_of_bike_should_i_buy/,What kind of bike should I buy?,/r/Columbus/comments/tuvtyv/what_kind_of_bike_should_i_buy/i37silh/,3,r/Columbus,0,3

"Amateur leatherworker here.

This sounds pretty difficult. It's one thing to make a jacket from a pattern, but another thing entirely to alter an existing one. The margin for error is much tighter, as you're only gonna get one shot at your hem. If that's the only change you need to make, is to cut off 2' of material and redo the bottom edge and (I assume) delete the belt loops, you might find someone that'll do it. If you want it drawn in at the bottom, they might be able to make a welt out of the material they removed to kind of cinch it a bit.

My advice is to look up leatherworkers, not tailors. A leather stitching machine is $3.5-5k, and I can't imagine a tailor having one. Only leatherworker in town I know of offhand is Open Hand. They do make large stuff like tote bags, so I assume they've got a stitching machine, since doing it by hand would probably be cost prohibitive.

"I don’t like to generalize public employees since some actually do some great work. But it’s well known, at least in the civil engineering world, that you move to the public side for the benefits and the work life balance.

It’s like pulling teeth to get county/city engineers offices reviewing plans to have a quicker turn around. The smaller cities with private firms reviewing plans are so much easier to deal with or even the smaller cities who have engineering offices are super easy to work with cause the workers there worked there for their careers and haven’t gotten lazier over the WFH craze.

I don’t blame people for wanting to WFH permanently. But people don’t see how much a switch like that changes the world. The economy is not setup like that at all. There’s restaurants and multiple other businesses in places where work from office is needed. Fully WFH changes everything. If you desire to WFH forever than try and switch jobs but don’t lash out at your company for wanting you back in the office. After seeing how the city of columbus went WFH and the turn around for submitted civil engineering plan reviews sky rocketed I can see how fully WFH could have lowered productivity. I know definitely not all maybe even not most people have worse productivity working from home but some people def do and that’s why some companies want people back fully or in a hybrid situation.,t2_ftnx9,BigEth,1,1648922972.0,0,t1_i34ucuc,i34ucuc,False,Meredithbaxterburly,t3_tuje0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tuje0y/intel_project_update/,Intel Project Update,/r/Columbus/comments/tuje0y/intel_project_update/i34ucuc/,4,r/Columbus,0,4

"I mean, this is according to an Ask Reddit thread, so it’s certainly nothing official or reliable 😂

Columbus has just come “on the map” in the last decade. People don’t know what to expect when they come here, but IMO you can really make life here what you want it to be. There’s no one overriding personality or identity that attracts the same type of people (like the Portland stereotype). 

I also feel like Columbus is pretty focused on the present/future rather than the past. Which in some ways is sad, because we’ve lost a lot of the history of the city. But at the same time, I think it’s good because there’s no preconceived notions about Columbus being a city that “was cool 100 years ago, but now it’s a shithole” like Cleveland or Detroit. (Not saying those cities are shitholes, but they are often the butt of the joke). 

But every day in Columbus there seems to be new restaurants, new districts, upcoming neighborhoods, new developments, new attractions and events, that all keep people excited to be here. I just feel like there’s been a great sense of anticipation and looking forward in Columbus for years.

* Relatively young as cities go, with pretty much zero national historical significance
* Ohio State.  I can't think of a major US city besides cbus whose identity is so wrapped up in its being the home of the big State U.

"I'd be curious to see how people define ""generic.""

But if you think generic means something like, ""what people think of when they picture an American city"" then you're gonna get New York City or LA, just because of all the movies and shows set there.

> 
> WASHINGTON, D.C. — Pope Francis has appointed Father Earl K. Fernandes, a former staff member of the apostolic nunciature in Washington and currently a Cincinnati pastor, to head the Diocese of Columbus, Ohio.
> 
> He succeeds Bishop Robert J. Brennan, named to head the Diocese of Brooklyn, New York, last September. He was installed Nov. 30.
> 
> At 49, Fernandes will be one of the youngest U.S. Catholic bishops. Ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati May 18, 2002, he served at the nunciature from 2016 to 2019. He has been pastor of St. Ignatius of Loyola Parish since 2019.
> 
> His appointment was announced in Washington April 2 by Archbishop Christophe Pierre, apostolic nuncio.
> 
> Fernandes will be the 13th bishop of Columbus. His episcopal ordination and installation will be May 31.
> 
> “We will miss his incredible intellect, unflagging energy and concern for all people, but know that these traits will serve him well as he expands his ministry to shepherd the faithful people of Columbus,” Cincinnati Archbishop Dennis M. Schnurr said in a statement.
> 
> “Through all his assignments, Father Fernandes has been an ever-joyful witness to the goodness, beauty and truth of the Catholic faith,” the archbishop said, asking the faithful of the archdiocese to join him in congratulating the Cincinnati priest “on this joyous news.”
> 
> “Let us keep our beloved brother in prayer as he starts this new ministry,” he added.
> 
> Fernandes was secretary at the nunciature from 2016 to 2019. Before that he was dean and assistant professor of moral theology at Mount St. Mary’s Seminary in Cincinnati from 2008 to 2016.
> 
> He is the published author of one book and numerous articles and essays, and has given talks and retreats across the country.
> 
> Born Sept. 21, 1972, in Toledo, Ohio, he is the fourth of five boys born to Indian immigrants. After graduating from St. Francis de Sales High School in Toledo, he earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Toledo.
> 
> He moved to Cincinnati to study at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. He had completed two years of medical school when he felt called to the priesthood. In 1996, at age 24, he went to a house of spiritual discernment in Rome. A year later he entered Mount St. Mary’s Seminary in Cincinnati, where he earned master’s degrees in divinity and theology.
> 
> After his 2002 ordination, he was assigned to Holy Angels Church in Cincinnati as associate pastor and taught at Lehman Catholic High School.
> 
> In 2004, he was sent to study in Rome at the Alphonsian Academy, a graduate school specializing in moral theology. He earned a doctorate in moral theology there in 2008.
> 
> For the next eight years he was academic dean and an assistant professor of moral theology at Mount St. Mary’s Seminary. From 2008 to 2014, he was a weekend assistant at Guardian Angels Church in Cincinnati, and from 2014-2016, he was the administrator of Sacred Heart Church in Cincinnati.
> 
> In 2016, he went to the apostolic nunciature in Washington where he was secretary. In 2019 he returned to Cincinnati and was named pastor of St. Ignatius of Loyola Parish.
> 
> He has been a board member of the Starfire Council of Greater Cincinnati, which assists disabled people. He is the published author of one book and numerous articles and essays, and has given talks and retreats across the country.
> 
> In 2020 he was named to the board of trustees of the Pontifical College Josephinum in Columbus.
> 
> An avid reader and writer, Fernandes has a particularly strong interest in education, culture and languages. In addition to English, he is fluent in Italian, Spanish and French.
> 
> The Diocese of Columbus is comprised of 23 counties in central and southern Ohio. It covers 11,310 square miles and has a Catholic population of about 207,000 out of a total population of over 2.8 million.

"So 3 months of rent in advance is very different from a larger deposit. At the end of the first 3 months the landlord has the exact same amount of risk that you will disappear or stop paying rent. With a 2-3 month deposit the landlord is protected if you do decide to stop paying they can go through the eviction process which can take 2-3 months without “losing” rent because the security deposit can cover that lost rent. The higher deposit also gives them added security if you damage the space significantly. Usually the security deposit only covers minor damage, and for a landlord if you do major damage their own option for collecting money for the damage is through the legal system, and if you either don’t have a significant income or you are locked up there is little to no chances they can collect any significant amount of money let alone any money. The larger deposit gives them protection for that.

You don’t have to know anyone in a church to reach out to one (and FYI I’m not trying to push you to Jesus or anything I’m not even Christian lol).

"The article fails to mention that there is an ongoing pandemic. Over 35,000 deaths in Ohio and over 2,500 deaths in Franklin county. Why is this statistic not worth mentioning for a countywide population shift of just over 2,500 reported in the article?  Other large urban counties who reported the greatest number of deaths around the state also ranked in the top five for population loss in the last couple years. With that said, I agree the population shift within central Ohio is driven more by the desire to live in “safe” suburban neighborhoods with lower instances of violent crime, access to higher quality public education, proximity to  grocery stores, restaurants, medical care, etc., and of course, last but certainly not least, access to affordable housing.",t2_5b0gnpt,malarosh,0,1648906616.0,0,t1_i33ufvc,i33ufvc,True,710-oil-614,t3_ttoklc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/ttoklc/as_columbus_housing_costs_rose_last_year_franklin/,"As Columbus housing costs rose last year, Franklin County lost population",/r/Columbus/comments/ttoklc/as_columbus_housing_costs_rose_last_year_franklin/i33ufvc/,0,r/Columbus,0,0

Indianapolis os absolutely miserable after the 3rd day of being there.  Everything closes early. I mean like 9p, early and good luck getting a bite after work. Mass Ave is 3 blocks of the equivalent of the Short North, hopping on the weekends but otherwise dead during the week. At least in the SN there SOME sort of life and people walking around.  Unless you are downtown, everything is at least 20-25 mins away: Speedway. Avon, Plainfield, Greenwood, Zionsville, etc etc.  

And the area around this magnificent Speedway you talk about....not the best. 

If you are a race fan, it's ok.  

If you are there for a weekend for a sporting event, heck of a time. 

If you are there for work every week like I was for 3 months, it's miserable after a few days because there isnt shit to do. Some nights, I even drove back to Columbus instead of staying because it was just blehhhhh.

But if I lose cell service on my handset for too long (my office is in the basement) then my incoming calls never ring, I just get a voicemail alert from a client asking if I'm screening them.

I've looked into cell repeaters, but boy are they expensive. $500 & up for a decent one.",t2_3yn91,discretion,0,1648902708.0,0,t1_i33no0n,i33no0n,True,BigWally68,t3_ttft86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/ttft86/wow_internet_has_been_awful_lately_who_is_better/,Wow internet has been awful lately.

Got 'em!

These people are talking about renting $200+ *over* their mortgage payment. The problem isn't that the poors can't afford to buy their shithole rental, it's that they can't meet the many requirements to get a loan. So, naturally, they should pay someone else's mortgage instead. Don't like it? Well, you should have thought about that and been born with rich parents. Or at least married for money.

"Private landlord here (as of now all of my places that might be a fit are rented). But some advice, be 100% honest and transparent about everything, I am personally ok with hearing someone out and possibly giving them a chance but if they lie to me on the application or give me false information about their past or background I will almost certainly turn down your application.

Have everything you need ready to go quickly and make sure you do everything by the book. I had someone a few months back take a week to fill out the application, I had assumed they did not want the place by the time I received their application. I had to call them back and tell them the unit was already rented and they were annoyed and frustrated. If someone is going to do you a favor and hear you out then you have to make sure you work hard to get your things together quickly so the landlord sees you as a serious candidate.

Understand the risks the landlord is taking on by renting to you and try and offer up a solution to reduce their risk. In your case they are taking the risk of renting to someone with a bad credit history, a criminal background, and someone who could be sent back to prison without any notice to the landlord. Offer up additional security deposit, if their standard is 1 months rent offer 2-3 months rent, find a co-signer, or at the very least find a community leader that is willing to vouch for you. Even though that last option doesn’t offer any financial security to the landlord you would be surprised how far a letter of support could go from the right person.

Be ready to move quickly, very often smaller landlords will have units available immediately, if you find a vacant unit don’t expect them to hold it for a few months or even a few weeks.

Lastly present yourself nicely, talk to the landlord with respect if you arrive to a showing dress nicely, take a shower, put on some clean cloths, and don’t pull up to the showing blasting music. The landlord is looking for someone who will take care of their space and be a good neighbor to their other tenants or neighbors. If you present yourself in a bad light they might hold that against you.

Now when it comes to actually finding a place I think you will have a very hard time cold calling places. I would recommend reaching out to housing organizations, local churches, or community groups. There might be community leaders who will be able to connect you with the right person.

"Airsoft pellets are plastic, not rubber (not sure what /u/Not_High_Maintenance is talking about here but whatever). They come in different weights (.2, .25, .28, and .32g) and constructions. The heavier ones and some specialty low weight variants are usually solid and you can get around 500-600fps out of the .32s with decent accuracy. You can go higher but you lose accuracy so nobody really does that. You can absolutely put a hole in a plastic fence with one of these. I know because I've accidentally done it from about 15yds when I used to play and I wasn't even using a high end gun (spring loaded M40 replica which clocked in around 550fps)

C02/green gas airsoft pistols can get up to those speeds as well. Source: have been shot by both my gun and a decent gas pistol. If that was a gas rifle Not_High_Maintenance was referencing with ""rubber bullet machine gun"" then that could be pretty high velocity with pretty remarkable accuracy. Gas pistols are usually a little lower powered than the rifles as well but that's because the rifles are usually of higher quality for milsim stuff.

"As for the freezing bit:
That is totally false, and not mentioned anywhere in the article.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVDBTVUFLY

Video shows what happens to orbeez after freezing them. They lose their ability to maintain structure. They grow as they freeze, so frozen ones would not fire from an orbeez gun. As they thaw, they completely fall apart.

They also begin to fall apart during the freezing process, so they are oddly shaped and freeze together as a single mass if stacked up.

There's absolutely no way people are successfully freezing orbeez and shooting them out of guns. 

Here's another video of someone trying to do exactly that:

I guess I should elaborate a little more. So I just got out of.prison in December. During my 2.5 yrs incarcerated my credit went to shit because of car repossession and other things that went to collections. I ended up getting out 19 months early. But I have to spend 7 of those months in this halfway house. I am not from columbus. I am able to leave and go to home confinement but I need a place to live. So I only have 2.5 months of work history. I swear it has been impossible for me to someone to rent as I really can't go around town or anything. Facebook and Craigslist are full of scammers. And it seems everytime I found a lead someone else steps in and takes it that has better credit or no criminal background. If I don't find a place by July I will go back to prison and lose my additional year off. So dire situation here. But we take home.over 5000.00 per month income and looking for 1-3 bedrooms not to picky on the area.
