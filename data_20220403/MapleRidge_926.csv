In 2019, there was a shift away from focusing so narrowly on “Political Islam” in their advocacy, and the reordering included more targeting the 2SLGBTQ+ community in ACT’s newsletters and articles published on the website. The establishment of a new organization, Action4Canada, by Price and another activist Tanya Gaw\*, allowed a slight rebranding and an easy expansion of topics requiring action.\*

If it is not a pre manufactured kit, they won't care unless greater than 10x10. So if it is a custom structure greater than 10x10, technically it requires a permit.

That being said, we don't force anybody to get a permit for anything unless a neighbor complains on them. And the municipality I work for does not punish people who start work without a permit.

"Incredibly biased, baity article. (""The nearly all-white jury"").

Apparently the taser did not affect him, he tried to attack an officer with a paring knife he had in his room (close quarters). So they had to shoot him. 

What more could of been done here? 

Maybe waited for other siblings? 

Why didn't she call the siblings before the cops, if he was being so uncooperative?

I know it's popular these days to be anti-cop, but I don't see what they did that was so wrong here. These people have families too. Knives in close quarters are incredibly dangerous. I'm all for scrutinizing and looking into incidents like this, but typically Canadian cops are, on average, far, far better than US cops that dominate the headlines. 

I also believe every cop needs a bodycam these days. 

To act like this is some race motivated shooting and that the white jurors would side with white cops regardless of info is incredibly weird.",t2_h9flu,alanpartridge69,0,1648495664.0,0,t1_i2h3tqt,i2h3tqt,True,idspispopd,t3_tkc803,https://www.reddit.com/r/MapleRidge/comments/tkc803/police_shot_kyaw_din_to_death_he_didnt_need_to_die/,Police Shot Kyaw Din to Death.

I really feel like MR gets an overly bad rap. We lived in Pitt Meadows for years before moving to Ridge. Pitt always seems to have a better reputation but when we lived there we had our home broken into once and my sons bike stolen. On the bad side of things….

"There is a crime map on the city of Maple Ridge website to look up so you can see what kind of crime is in the area. Typical stuff though, don't leave anything in your cars, be careful about what you leave outside (like bikes), assault type crimes are low.

Trains, you can hear them but there's a no-horn bylaw for most of Maple Ridge. However, you will be able to hear the horns from across the river. Train noise is a fact of life if you move where there is train transport, they are loud and the sound carries many km. Be aware that area is *not far * from the tracks or major arterial routes so it will definitely come with a variety of noises (planes, trains, and automobiles) so you may want to visit the area at multiple times of day/night and have a meal and read a book both in and out of your car before you buy. If train noise really affects you then looking in Silver Valley might be more suitable for you. 

Traffic can be totally horrendous because of the lack of infrastructure upgrades. 1h is probably average for most days but there's a lot of places that can go haywire. Your wife could take the west coast express if she works downtown, it is a luxury ride compared to the Skytrain. There's also the ""rapid"" bus, but you driving her is probably the best option.

"I moved here in 2017. Overall I really like it. My neighbourhood is extremely safe. There’s definitely homelessness and property crime, mostly around downtown, but it’s safe. One thing you don’t see here is gang shootings, but that’s because this town belongs to the bikers, and honestly I think most people are a-ok with that. 

If you buy a house here, property taxes are fairly high, despite the fact the city doesn’t supply some basic services like garbage pickup. That was a big surprise when I moved here, and somehow people here have convinced themselves that’s a good thing. 

City council is owned by developers, and you can see it by the rapid infill without adequate infrastructure. Traffic during rush hour can be brutal. There’s new townhouses popping up everywhere they can clear land. If you have a job in Vancouver to commute to, be prepared for 1.5 hrs each way. I work from home or I’d never move here, tbh. 

Also one thing a lot of people don’t realize is MR is very conservative. Our MP who has been repeatedly re-elected is a hardcore conservative who voted against, among many things, *banning* conversion therapy. And people here celebrated that. You will see maga hats, confederate flags and convoy idiots here. For a leftie moving here from east van that was probably the biggest culture shock. 

Now, the great thing about here is the proximity to nature. If you like to hike or fish, or off-road, or go boating, this place is fantastic. I’m an avid fly fisherman, and that’s one of the main reasons I moved here. That and it was one of the most affordable options still in the greater Vancouver area.

"Like most cities of a similar size, it depends on where you are. The crime is substantially centered around the town core are. If you are further out in the burbs it's as safe as any place. Relatively few violent crimes; mostly property crimes to support drug addictions.

The upside is the proximity to outdoor oriented activities. Hiking, biking, equestrian, etc.

I was born here now Im old here.  The town is developement crazy, the town council is thinly veiled developer sponsored. So we are behind in services and are crowded. Plus weve never had an industrial tax base so no jobs, high property taxes and a deaf city council. 

We have a growing street person population, hence small petty crime is rampant and we have a large low income population so we have dollar stores walmart etc everywhere.

The pluses I am aware of, proximity to many other cities, mountainy parks, many rivers, great library, good fishing, foraging hiking biking alouette lake stave lake and 100, ooo sushi places and starting to erupt with chicken and pizza places.

"Fair comment. However, ""rate of infection"" refers to per 100k rather than overall figures comparing unvaccinated to vaccinated, as evidenced by data from the WHO, CDC & others, therefore when Dr Henry acknowledges vaccinated people being infected at a higher rate, it's not speaking to the high number of vaccinated people here. As that pertains to Isreal, well... Again, on their 4th jab, and rates of infection among the highest in the world to parallel their rate of vaccination being equally as high. Here's a WHO link to the interactive dashboard if you wish to confirm: https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/il

I'm glad we can agree Trudeau is terrible; I think most Canadians can agree on that.

I still like to think that guy in the photo is on my side of the fence referring to Israel's grim covid situation, and that the Star of David is more to communicate the country in question rather than the religion or any grisly historical reference, however I admit that I may just be an optimist who believes in the good in all people.

"There are higher rates of infection for those vaccinated than for those that are not vaccinated because there are more people who have been vaccinated in this country than not vaccinated. That's pretty simple math.

 All you have to do is take a look at World War II documentary footage to see Jews in Poland walking around with the star of David stitched onto their clothing.

"I dunno what you mean by ""clearly"" but that's not the connection I made, not at all, and I don't think it's the connection the individual in that photo was trying to make either.

Isreal has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, maybe the highest idk for sure, and the only vaccine they use is Pfizer. I believe they were the second country (after China) to introduce vaccine passports. They are in the process of administering the 4th booster to their populace. They have led the way in most of the measures many western governments (including our own) have used & age using to fight covid

In spite of this, they also have among the highest covid infection rates in the world. Our own Dr Bonnie Henry has admitted higher rates of infection by those vaccinated than not, increasing with the number of boosters one has received.

I think this has left a lot of people with questions as to the efficacy of the vaccine, particularly in light of how many people have lost their jobs, been segregated, mocked and labeled racist, misogynist, told how to think and that their views were unacceptable, and that just by the Prime Minister - without even mentioning how broader society treats those same people.

One of those questions is, I think, ""should we be following the example of a country like Isreal, considering how poor are their results?"" I think that is what the multiple needles coupled with the Star of David likely symbolizes.

"Maple Ridge is great. We were between Maple Ridge and Squamish as well. Like many of the communities in the area, it is having trouble keeping up with growth. I wanted to tackle a few of your individual points:

Doctors: It's tough to find a practice that is accepting single patients, let alone a family. We live in Maple Ridge and our doctors are in Vancouver and Port Coquitlam. 

Specialists: we have a few specialists out here and in the surrounding areas. It depends on what you're looking for. 

Shopping: means Coquitlam Center. Our mall is terrible. We have quaint small shops. One does not move to Maple Ridge for the mall.

Outdoor: Trails are great, but they're getting crowded. We have Golden Ears and the UBC Research Forest (no dogs allowed). You need a park pass for Golden Ears during the warmer months. It's crowded and uncomfortable at times. 

Silver Valley: It's great, but not self-sustaining. You need to go to downtown Maple Ridge for ammenties/shopping/groceries, etc. There are few schools in the area, meaning that if you have children it can be a hassle to get into a school nearby.

Housing: Our housing prices are nuts right now. The official community plan calls for multi-family properties.

Growth: From the official community plan: ""To meet the population projection of approximately 109,000 people by 2031, Maple Ridge will require an additional 6,250 to 7,500 dwelling units, depending on dwelling type mix and average household size... Affordability, location, and availability of ground-oriented and apartment style units will be major factors in attracting new residents and young families to Maple Ridge, and providing greater choice for the changing needs of current residents.""  We're losing greenspace. Where multi-family homes are being developed it is stressed the current infrastructure. Parking for example or increased traffic on quiet residential streets.

With all that being said... I wouldn't move - yet. It's a good community to raise a family, but if you're moving here for the small community feel you might be disappointed.

"That's right - but the total amount of property tax the city collects, is based on *their* costs. All costs are rising across the board, due to rampant inflation, caused by the quantitative easing (creation of new money) by all governments, trying to ""kick start the economy"".

So people saying ""if I have to pay more taxes, we should at least get free garbage pickup!"" just don't understand how these things work. You can have *free* garbage pick up any time you like, but starting such a program *will* increase the city's costs and *will* have to be funded by increased taxes, regardless of rising/falling home values.

"I used to work there as a chicken cook. It was very understaffed, especially in the back. The employees could not keep up with peak demand. And that led to cutting corners. The work was comparativly harder than other fast food places for nearly the same wage. The work wad harder because of the understaffed, and the cycle kept going. On top of that management wasn't the best. And broken things were rarely fixed. This led to worse reviews and less demand. I quit before it closed however. I tried not shortcut while making chicken. However the other cooks wouldn't bother to follow protocol, it wasn't properly taught, enforced, and we were understaffed.",t2_a1i2vgtu,Senior_Mention_6298,0,1641338382.0,0,t1_hra1v2s,hra1v2s,True,Shawn_Yang24,t3_ros9ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/MapleRidge/comments/ros9ax/kfc_closed/,KFC Closed,/r/MapleRidge/comments/ros9ax/kfc_closed/hra1v2s/,4,r/MapleRidge,1,4

Big O tires - they do more than just tires though. They saved me from having to buy 4 brand new winter tires when I drove over some nails. KalTire and Canadian Tire wouldn't attempt to repair it. I was to leave for work in a couple days and have a 4 wheel drive and wasn't able to find a single to match the 3 that were fine. I was looking at 1500-2000 for a new set. Guy at Big O said to just let him try to fix it...that was 3 years ago and I'm still driving on it. It cost me $35. I took it to Big O on my mother's recommendation - she's 70+ and never feels taken care of when it comes to anything auto related...because she usually isn't.

"I moved to Pitt Meadows in 2011, at age 40-something.  My husband & I had been out of the real estate market for decades, throwing away money on rent. We chose Pitt Meadows for one reason: it was affordable.  We bought a two-bedroom apartment in a low rise building in ""downtown"" Pitt Meadows (kitty corner to the library), and lived there for eight years. 

If you like to get outdoors (walking, cycling, hiking, kayaking) it's a great area. Commuting into the city on the West Coast Express is one of the most beautiful commutes in the country. You will be very reliant on your car for shopping, as there aren't many walk-to-shop opportunities. There are only a handful of restaurants (at all), and maybe 3 - 4 you'll want to patronize regularly.  There's a new microbrewery (Foamer's Folly) that's popular. 

I would be a little bit concerned about you, as a single guy, being able to find a lot of social connections in Pitt Meadows.  It's a community dominated by families and retirees. There aren't a lot of casual social spaces. I think I might have been lonely living there by myself.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Im a 25 year old guy and I've lived in Maple Ridge my entire life. MR and PM have to be the worst places to live for 20 something year olds.

I've been griping about this for years now. MR and PM have the worst night life in the GVR and seeing as they're bedroom communities for people raising kids, I don't expect this to change anytime soon.

On a more positive note, if you like the outdoors, hiking, camping, fishing, or, hell, even if like to be able to run/job with a beautiful senic view of the mountains then you will love it here.

The cities here are really good for families who have or plan on having kids. The schools are nice, the neighborhoods are (mostly) safe, there's plenty of community events that a great for small children, again greats spot to introduce your kids to the outdoors, ect, ect.

"We just had a new elementary school open 2 years ago in Albion. The idea of another elementary school is always floating around as even with this new school, maple ridge is at or over capacity in all the schools. I would say that even if they purchase land in the near future, I would say we are a minimum of 5 years away from any progress there. I know east ridge has more of a need as it's growing so fast. There are some.really good programs out here though including Montessori and outdoor school. There is also meadowridge if you're considering private school.

As for daycare, it really depends on what sort you would like to use. For big centres, there will most likely be waiting lists. There are lots of stay at home moms looking to take on another child to help bolster their income. That being said, the 10 dollar a day daycare that has been promised by the government could change all that so it's a tricky one to predict 5-7 years down the road.

Here’s my advice. Drive around the downtown area of MR and get familiar with the park and school zones. Yes you do have to do one parallel park but it’s not on a hill when my son did it.
Here’s what you do…..shoulder check every time you make a turn. Scan the intersections. Watch your speed! Anything over 30k in a school or park zone is instant fail. No floating stops!

"There is a reason the test route is withheld. It’s no different than getting the answers for a school test beforehand. They do need to determine many things about your driving skills before they release you on our city streets.

However, I highly recommend going to test in Port Coquitlam. The wait time to get tested can be a little longer. Depends if you want to spend more money or more time. (It does take less time than having to rebook for your second test.)

None of the teens I know passed in M.Ridge but did when they took the test elsewhere. My daughter didn’t pass here in M.Ridge. Apparently she had several issues on the road test. In PoCo she passed the first test.

Mind you this was six years ago, maybe things have improved since then. Maybe they decided the money grab was too obvious. No young person we know passed without taking the test twice, sometimes three or four times. Someone suggested she should test elsewhere. 

According to her the test route was so much better than here in Maple Ridge, with less trick questions and situations. She wasn’t familiar with (and much more worried) the PoCo roads at the time but she said it was an easy route. Even the instructor was nice!

Roughnecks, auto workers, mill workers, and longshoreman rule the town and make the most money, so boys with little ambition gravitate to those professions and never leave town. When I left in my late teens there was still a really bad Oxycontin sales problem and some of my friends got into trouble down the road. Girls define themselves by what logger they managed to snag, and SAHM was the top job aspiration for most of the ladies I graduated with. It's not that opportunity was low there, just everyone's ambition sucked, and they bullied anyone with a spark of greatness into the same doldrums they were in. 

That said, it is the NATURE that makes Maple Ridge incredible. If people are unwelcoming, that's why: no need to be welcoming to strangers if there's loads of space for you to never see anyone. Pick a trail and go. We have ELEVEN LAKES. The Golden Ears mountains are on our back porch. We have Pitt Lake, one of only two tidal lakes in the world. We have Bears, Mountain Lions, Bobcats, and huge owls and herons. It's a nature lovers paradise. You can drink from alouette river. The air is some of The cleanest in the whole Fraser Valley. There's a humidity pocket in the summer that brings MR up to 35 degrees some years and it's like Kelowna.

Anywho, if you do move there, just make your own circle as quick as you can and stick to it like everyone else does and IMO you'll be very happy. It's a great place to raise young kids, just get out before their minds solidify.",t2_titbeod,Nehima123,0,1631169088.0,0,t1_hc5k0y5,hc5k0y5,True,19h_rayy,t3_p82tke,https://www.reddit.com/r/MapleRidge/comments/p82tke/what_is_maple_ridge_really_like/,What is Maple Ridge really like?,/r/MapleRidge/comments/p82tke/what_is_maple_ridge_really_like/hc5k0y5/,0,r/MapleRidge,0,0

"Most people would say it's recommended but I've been driving on these roads the last 24 yrs and never once put snow tires on. I've also had my road star for the last 15yrs and I use to commute to and from North Vancouver and ski at all the local mountains. I do own a truck and a set of chains but rarely need either for the mountains here.

The other guys made some good points but depending on how comfortable you are behind the wheel, I wouldn't sweat it if your not looking to shell out a bunch of money on tires that you may only need a couple weeks out of the year. Especially if you're not commuting far or super early when it would be colder with possible ice. 

The snow is typically sparse here and usually its only the last couple weeks of Jan - beginning of February does it get really cold... and even thats hit or miss.",t2_dukiwh8w,timhortons81,0,1630297759.0,0,t1_haw42mv,haw42mv,True,neilcbty,t3_pe2u4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MapleRidge/comments/pe2u4z/is_it_recommended_to_have_winter_tires_for/,Is it recommended to have winter tires for driving around pitt meadows- maple ridge area in fall & winter?,/r/MapleRidge/comments/pe2u4z/is_it_recommended_to_have_winter_tires_for/haw42mv/,3,r/MapleRidge,0,3

"I use a 3rd party company, TekkSavvy. They piggyback off of Telus and the cost is half of what Telus charges. The service is the same as Telus, with an occasional 30 second blip around 3AM every other week, which is not usually a problem since I'm usually asleep.
The price is super cheap, although you have to purchase your router whereas with telus or shaw you usually rent the router and any issues are replaced for free.

I would reccomend TekSavvy to anyone in the lower mainland; the outright cost of purchasing a modem is steep, but the long term cost is insanely cheap.

Download speed is in the 900mbs upload around 80 during the day.  Drops down to about 400mbs and 40 in the evening.  

Had some issues with lost connections over the last year and spent time with tech support complaining each for 4 nights and then they sent a technician.  He fixed the issue in about 30 minutes by changing some coax to the router.

I pay 20$ a month for weekly garbage and unlimited green waste pickup. There's not a chance in hell the city could replace that service for even close to that amount.
