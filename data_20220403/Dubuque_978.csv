Shot tower inns pizza seemed pretty good. Their nachos were garbage though and just tasted like the cheap stuff you'd get from Walmart. Not sure how their other appetizers are though.

Adobos is pretty solid. It's basically Qdoba.

Pusateri's is garbage pizza and I wish I had my money back. Horrible. Overpriced garbage.

Your Pie (another pizza place) seemed ok. Their pepperoni pizza was good but the Buffalo chicken one (they call it southern heat) was just eh.

"u/sweet-tuba-riffs posted this guide a few years ago, so credit goes to him. My personal favorites from his list are Oolong and Copper Kettle. I’ll also throw out Knockout Melts as a newer recommendation (sandwich shop). Here’s the guide:

I'm just going to throw some things out here for you. Sorry for the wall of text.

Fine/Romantic dining experience with higher-class atmosphere: Brazen (Millwork District, stylish, with open kitchen and craft cocktails), Pepper Sprout (Main Street, great culinary constructions, bills itself as Midwest Cuisine), L-May Eatery (Main Street, fancy pizzas and such, cocktails), Vinnie Vanucci's** (Main Stret, italian-american food, neat place, okay food).

Asian restaurants with good atmosphere: Pete's Thai (North End, good portions of authentic Thai dishes), Ichiban Sushi Bar and Hibachi (off highway 20, for the Midwestern US this is honestly some of the best sushi you can get), Lena's Thai (off Northwest Arterial Highway, about the same as Pete's Thai, but out of your way), Oolong Asian Cuisine (off Main Street, Vietnamese and Thai food, not my fave but I know lots of people who like it, in the vicinity of a lot of stuff).

Craft breweries: Jubeck New World (just off Main Street, cozy atmosphere with some solid beer selections, right next to Oolong), 7Hills (Millwork District, big venue, good food, Bockberries Burger is amazing, least favorite beer of the three though), Dimensional (Main Street, best beer selection of the three, nice venue).

American fare with good atmosphere: Barel House (Main Street, loud sports bar atmosphere but still very nice), 1st & Main (Main Street, quieter by day and gets a little bar-like at night, very good), Copper Kettle (North End, solid local place with a neat atmosphere)

Experiential things: American Lady Happy Hour Cruise (North End, for like $18 you can get all-you-can-drink plain beers and all-you-can-eat appetizers on a 1.5-2 hour Mississippi River cruise), Yardarm (North End, food, drinks, and pretty cool live music venue right on the Mississippi), Stone Cliff Winery (Riverfront, not particularly great wine, but neat venue right on the river walk which is worth a visit), Mississippi Moon Bar @ Diamond Jo Casino (Riverfront, a cool venue, expensive drinks but shows are free a lot of the time); Q Showroom and Backwater Stage @ Q Casino (North End, indoor and outdoor venues respectively, some shows are free), Rainbow Lounge (off Main Street, karaoke).

Coffee: Monk's (Bluff Street, coffee shop by day, pub by night, cool vibes), Jitterz (Main Street, normal coffee house), Jumble (JFK Mall area, drive through coffee shop).

Bars worthy of mention: The (Busted) Lift (Main Street, below an italian restaurant, great beer selection, great atmosphere, music sometimes), Monk's (see above), Gin Ricky's (Central Avenue, if you're into clubbin' and questionable decisions).

Best burgers: Paul's Tap (just off Main, like Bob's Burgers if it was a bar and was decorated with taxidermy); Knicker's Saloon (Central Avenue, kind of an old towny/biker bar, but their food is stellar and cheap).

Don't forget: There are lots of other things to do while in Dubuque, including natural/wildlife areas, the Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium, Fenelon Place Elevator (billed as the world's shortest and steepest railroad), and much more.",t2_7j8dd,ryandavenport,0,1645967455.0,0,t1_hyn1yv0,hyn1yv0,True,bbgarnett,t3_t2gpnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubuque/comments/t2gpnf/visiting_mar_911_looking_for_food_recommendations/,Visiting Mar 9-11 looking for food recommendations?,/r/dubuque/comments/t2gpnf/visiting_mar_911_looking_for_food_recommendations/hyn1yv0/,8,r/dubuque,0,8

"There are basically no COVID restrictions at this point (honestly there wasn't much of any to begin with here).  With no clue as to what you and your wife like to do here's the basic of basic rundowns.

There are lots of places to drink. If you like craft beer Dimensional is the best, followed by Jubecks, followed by 7 Hills. Speaking of 7 Hills, they are down in the Millwork district which is a pretty fun area to walk around and experience. There's also good food down in that area in the form of Brazen, 7 Hills, Ginos, Backpocket. Did I mention there is a cool arcade below Backpocket in the Novelty Ironworks building?

OH, everyone's going to tell you to go to Paul's for their burgers. It's a fine little dive and the burgers are fine and cheap and if you like taxidermy it's a fun sight. I'd argue the best bar burger is actually the charmichael at the Doghouse, however.

It's an odd time to come to Dubuque because if it wasn't cold and or melty outside, I'd recommend bike trails or the Mines of Spain or Eagle Point or the river or a plethora of other outdoor things. But this weekend weather-wise is going to be weird, 27 on Sat and 51 on Sunday. Sunday might be a good opportunity to look into some of those things but I imagine everywhere will be a wet mudfest with the melt. My suggestion would be to keep it mostly urban and try and find and photograph as many murals as you can. There's been a big mural initiative in the past decade and we now have a TON of them downtown.

There are a couple casinos if gambling is your thing, Q and Diamond Jo. I prefer Q as they are owned by the city VS D Jo which is owned by Boyd Gaming which is traded on the stock market. Diamond Jo is probably a better facility however and has some decent places to eat (Filament) and the riverwalk which is down by it would actually be a great place to walk along Sunday morning with those temperatures I brought up.

Without knowing more about your interests or how familiar you already are or aren't with the area, it's hard for me to guide you further. There are plenty of chain restaurants, their's a mall that has some okay shopping, there's a couple movie theaters, there's the field of dreams just outside of town (but I think it's not officially open right now), there's Galena just right outside of town with lots of small town shopping, there's a few local wineries, etc etc etc. Good luck!!!

"I would recommend Adams Pet Hospital in Asbury. They are on the more expensive side but are a reputable vet clinic and licensed pharmacy.

I would **not** recommend Coloniel Terrace. I have never brought my own animals there but have called on behalf of a local rescue many times. I have been refused to see for initial exams and microchip scans which they are able to do. While dropping off for other people they never can find the the right information and upon giving one owners name they asked if it was for (X)? Which is the deceased brother who passed away in 2011.

"Perhaps a mindful response that is meant to be helpful or at least informative would be best offered after the responder knows to whom he/she is speaking. Speak to the level of the audience is always the right way to go. So, I always read the the profile and make an effort to know the backstory before I simply dismiss someone based on my beliefs or my lack of understanding regarding their post.

To say my statement was a me thing was correct. I was bored. To assume it was because I’m lazy or just too ignorant to make the effort to not be so is rude.

"You’re probably not going to notice too much difference between the screens and sound, they are about the same. AMC has the traditional tiered seating layout you’re probably familiar with, and I prefer over the much flatter slope of Phoenix. 

(Re-7:30 showings) Theater customers are way way way down since covid, there’s not enough demand to warrant staying open later. I’m not sure how they are staying open at all. I’ve been going to AMC 4-6 times a month (AMC stubs, up to 13 shows a month for $25 a month) since before covid hit. Since covid, the most I’ve seen in a theater during a showing was about 10 people for the latest Bond film. Lots of times my GF and I were the only ones watching that particular film showing. 

Personally I don’t like Phoenix, the buttons for controlling the reclining seat are on the inside of the arm rest, and my leg keeps triggering it randomly, which is very annoying… that, and I find it much harder trying to drink my soda in a reclined position. Combine that with tickets being much more expensive than an AMC stubs membership (6 shows would cost me more than twice as much), and I’ll stick with AMC.",t2_21m1s,Wrathwilde,0,1638788825.0,0,t1_hng2q6m,hng2q6m,True,bleedingwriter,t3_ra1az3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubuque/comments/ra1az3/phoenix_theaters_compared_to_amc_classic/,Phoenix theaters compared to Amc classic?,/r/dubuque/comments/ra1az3/phoenix_theaters_compared_to_amc_classic/hng2q6m/,2,r/dubuque,0,2

"A lot of you are not, I'm assuming, living in the 3rd ward. I do, I work there, and we have a fledgling business there. I also know several liberal people with wealth that are buying up rental properties and investing in them. Which is a good thing. However, rent increases are also corresponding to the investments and properties the city has provided funds to buy, refurbish, and then sell are tipping over 100k for less than desirable location and amenities like non existing yards and 4 feet between houses. We looked at one with the intention of buying. Great work, very attractive on the inside fully modern but that's the only perk. Not even close to the valuation of 120,000 when the internal and external aesthetics are the only value.
Aside from that, if you are concerned with gentrification, most of the residents in my area can't afford that so they are still stuck in rentals or, their rental is rehabbed and then the rent is renegotiated, causing them to have to relocate to a property they can afford. My neighbor is one that is doing this and he is not concerned, left on politics, he stated it was inevitable anyway and he's not concerned.
Personally, we rent a 3 bed 2 bath 2 story house for $850 a month with a two car garage and large driveway. We can't afford more than that and it's a hell of a deal in dubuque at that price range. So if our landlord does take up the offer, we now have to relocate.
All in all it will rejuvenate the third ward housing, but will also cause rents to rise, home prices to be out of reach for the residents to purchase, and serve nothing more than to gentrify the north end with more affluent residents from other wards. But that's my opinion based on the conversations I've had with landlords, new landlords, residents of my ward, and my own personal stake.",t2_agpdoo21,doyoureresearch,0,1636432970.0,0,t1_hjwe0ny,hjwe0ny,True,judojon,t3_qpmnz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubuque/comments/qpmnz3/new_mayors_first_act_is_to_sponsor_land_monopoly/,"New Mayors first act is to sponsor land monopoly m Free money to landlords is not how you lower rents.

Empty land costs less than occupied land; on empty land you don't have to pay for fire/police coverage, administrative, educated employees, road maintenace, sewer/water, etc. For all the services we pay property tax for, the city (that's you) has to make up the difference.

"I was a freshman during the ""race riots."" My former babysitter was one of the cross-burners.

Although that was a long time ago, I've got present family there (we're white) who are in their 20s and 30s that are still spouting some pretty nasty racist stuff. Like, bans on Facebook kind of stuff - they seem to think it's appropriate when surrounded by white people to say all sorts of nonsense. Their kids are picking this up, and unless there's some grand interruption, the cycle will continue.

So yeah, to the OP, if you're really concerned about this sort of thing, then Dubuque's probably not a great choice. I know the town has been trying to make strides, and they have since my high school days, but the problem is that they need to make marathon-length strides and they're not anywhere near that yet. It's disappointing because Dubuque otherwise has a lot of promise in how it's developed over the last 15 years or so. But folks still reference Chicago whenever crime is brought up, and if that hasn't changed over 30 years then I don't know what will change it.",t2_497t6,gloomchen,0,1632887987.0,0,t1_heom5oo,heom5oo,False,oliveartichoke,t3_pxchcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubuque/comments/pxchcc/diversity_in_dubuque/,Diversity in Dubuque?,/r/dubuque/comments/pxchcc/diversity_in_dubuque/heom5oo/,3,r/dubuque,0,3

"If you're used diverse places and that remains important to you, you're not likely to be happy in Dubuque.  Chronic-lesOfGnaRnia is spot on in my experience. Yes, there **are** many who embrace diversity. But there are many more who have no clue. These are the folks who, seeing that you're white, will simply assume you share their views and comment on the (insert racial slur here) that moved into the house across the street. Folks who won't go downtown (such as it is) at night because of the proximity of the ""ghetto"".  People who will tell you publicly that  White Lives Matter too, missing the point completely. It's a widespread point of view. Here's a news story titled [A look at Dubuque's racial climate](https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/A-look-at-Dubuques-racial-climate--422431603.html).

When BLM protests were happening after the murder of George Floyd, there were local rumors that BLM agitators were going to take buses to Dubuque from the Quad Cities area (about 90 miles south) to riot in Dubuque. It spread wildly.  I was personally warned by several people about this. I think it was posted on FB as well.  A regional grocery chain that has 3 stores in Dubuque had workers board up their glass store front, but **only** the store closest to the predominately black community -   which suggests to me that ignorance has money behind it here.

Dubuque is conservative and very Catholic. (Judgements will be made.)

Dubuque is an ""All American City"" winner. It's beautiful and has a lot going for it, but diversity is not it's strength. It's nowhere near some other places  in terms of embracing and celebrating inclusion, diversity, and different points of view. And if you're politically left leaning, you'll constantly find yourself wondering if it's worth the effort to respond to the words that just came out of  someone's mouth. (Yes, there are still some Trump signs up.)

Personally, I'd consider Madison, WI or Iowa City if diversity is important to you.

"I was born in Dubuque and lived there till my mid-20s, and am very pastey white.  I wholeheartedly agree that Dubuque is extremely racist toward black people.  For context, I was in Senior during the ""race riots"" (wasn't really a riot just a fight caused by a black kid that ran off with a bag of weed from a white kid) and knew the people on both sides of the fights. A kid in my grade schools family got chased out of town in the 80s when someone spray painted racial epithets on their garage.  Crosses were burned, and the KKK and Oprah came to town.  It was a shit show.  The most racist people I know still live in Dubuque.  

All that said, Dubuqe's racism always seemed specifically directed at black people, and more specifically poor black transplants from Chicago. I grew up with friends of Peruvian, Mexican, Spanish, Vietnamese, Hawaiian, and black american descent. The black kids were the only ones that ever had any real issues that I'm aware of. 

I know several black people that have lived in Dubuque for decades at this point.  They're all doing pretty well and seem to like it there.  However, as someone that's traveled quite a bit and lived for years as the only white person within a mile radius in another state, I wouldn't live in Dubuque again.  I have some fond memories, but its full of shiftless alcoholics, heroin and meth addicts, and some of the most closed minded people I've ever encountered.  Violent crime is commonplace.  For a town of what 60-70k people there should not be so many robberies, shootings, stabbings, beatings, etc.  

Essentially the OP and significant other would probably be fine as adults living in town, but growing up could be rough on those kids.  Not because they are not 100% white, but more because the mentality of people there tends to be awful. A Dubuquers idea of travel is going to a mall in Cedar Rapids or going to an all inclusive resort in Mexico/Dominican.  A culinary experience there consists of putting too much pre-ground black pepper on a turkey and dressing sandwich. 

Though this post was entirely negative, Dubuque is beautiful and there are a lot of things to do; however, I would never consider raising my child there.",t2_89yqy,Tankbean,0,1632876480.0,0,t1_henys6a,henys6a,False,oliveartichoke,t3_pxchcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubuque/comments/pxchcc/diversity_in_dubuque/,Diversity in Dubuque?,/r/dubuque/comments/pxchcc/diversity_in_dubuque/henys6a/,7,r/dubuque,0,7

"So, due to Dubuque being mostly white, you're going to get a lot of white people from Dubuque telling you ""there's not a lot of racism. It's super accepting around Dubuque!"" 

It's not. I grew up there and have a family of a few different races, none of them white. Can you make it in Dubuque as a minority? 100%. Are your kids going to experience racism? 1,000,000%. You'll find community that is completely accepting, and a lot of the white people in Dubuque are very progressive. But a shit load of them are absolutely redneck dipshits who fly the Confederate flag because of ""heritage."" (Yes, in a union state.) I was called a nigger in highschool more than once, and also told that I can't be offended. I was told I couldn't be offended by the word nigger, by a white person. At my first HS football game, a guy was talking about ""mutts,"" to which a girl said ""what's a mutt?"" 
""You know,"" he replied, ""half white, half nigger."" I dated a girl and her dad found out she was dating a mixed guy, or as he called me ""a black boy."" She said yes and he told her that ""no she wasn't."" Not understanding, she told him ""yeah, here's his picture."" To which he told her that as long as she lived there, she would not bring a nigger into his house. 

Dubuque is getting more diverse, for sure. But Iowa is just a tough place, in general, to raise minorities, and Dubuque might be the worst ""big town"" to attempt to do that in. My own brother in law, married to my black sister, told her to her face that any racism she experienced was all in her head, and yet thinks that black people are the problem with police brutality. He has two black daughters who are FUCKED with that type of mentality going on in their dad's head, and his family all think the same way, and are a big-name family in Dubuque. My other sister got her black son into the Catholic school but she was being told by people whose kids go to that school that he doesn't belong there and that he wouldn't fit in. That he was, and I quote, ""a different class from the people who go to school there."" Our family is upper middle class. There is only one reason for that comment, and it's his skin. This was 6 months ago. 

I live in Denver, CO now, and living here has only exemplified how stupid my experiences were growing up in Dubuque. People can tell you all day that Dubuque is super accepting but it's generally people who are white and have never actually dealt with that. Your kids will find other minorities to hang out with, and other white kids who will accept them for who they are, but to pretend that Dubuque isnt racist is bullshit. I love Dubuque.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.
