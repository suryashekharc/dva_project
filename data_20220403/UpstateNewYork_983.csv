"I live 20 minutes or so from Canton so about a half hour from Potsdam, it's really all about what you make of it.     Between Canton and Potsdam you shouldn't have any problem finding a decent rental.  Canton has a townhouse section and Potsdam has plenty to offer.  You also should be able to find a good place in the towns immediately outside those two villages like Hannawa Falls.  

I grew up here and went to college here, always thought I'd leave but all my friends and family are still here and I've come to appreciate the good parts.  If you're into hiking you found the right place, because there is state land all over the place with a ton of trails.  It seems like I find a new one to hike every year.  

This area is prime rust belt territory so there's plenty of abandoned buildings, but in the last 10 years or so there's been a bit more development.   Healthcare is probably the main growing industry around here. 

You're right about day tripping to other places.  I do it quite often to Lake Placid which would be about an hour from Potsdam.  

Winters can be dreary, but you get used to it.  Summers and autumn are great though.   My advice would be to find friends that own lakefront property, as a large portion of the county spends time in the summer at any one of the numerous lakes in the area.

I'm happy to answer any questions you have about here.",t2_ao7ncvz2,tropic_gnome_hunter,0,1649009281.0,0,t1_i3916ns,i3916ns,True,AppropriateMove8989,t3_tve7le,https://www.reddit.com/r/upstate_new_york/comments/tve7le/opinions_on_living_in_potsdam_and_lawrence_county/,Opinions on living in Potsdam and Lawrence County area?,/r/upstate_new_york/comments/tve7le/opinions_on_living_in_potsdam_and_lawrence_county/i3916ns/,1,r/upstate_new_york,0,1

">Let's say I have a commercial tenant, maybe a coffee shop.... They're late on rent....

To use a comparison, you need to make a valid comparison. In this case, it isn't a ""late on rent"" situation, this is a ""they're late on rent and I've taken them to court and gotten a judgment saying I'm owed the the money"" situation.

Never mind that corporate landlords don't have the legal authority to freeze a bank account, but a state government with a court judgment in hand does have that authority.

>should I freeze all their bank accounts because I promised my sugar baby I'd buy her a new BMW?

If you're using a valid comparison, then the question is ""should I legally enforce the judgment?"" And I would argue the answer is yes. When a business has a judgment against it, the court can authorize outright taking of assets. That can be a straight up seizure of funds in a bank account. 

We can agree that a stadium isn't a good way to spend the funds, however that issue is separate from the issue of whether the money was validly owed, and whether the method used to enforce the judgment was legal. Intentionally conflating the two issues doesn't help you prove the state wrong, it just makes you look like you have an agenda.

>Now all the baristas are out of a check and can't pay their student loans or buy $5/gallon gas.

"Depends on what part of Byrne Dairy, and what manager.

I've worked in their bottling plants and it was by far the worst job I've had, surpassing the short while I spent working in a tampon factory. If you're just starting out, 12 hour shifts plus overtime was the norm. Most of the jobs were broken so far down into as repetitive and menial a task as possible. They're always hiring machine operators. Why? Because what they actually mean when they say ""machine operator"" is:

*""person who is willing to lift 25 pounds of packaging material from it's own packaging and load the machine. Every 1 minute and 30 seconds. For 12 hours with only two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.""* 

You also have to manage babysitting the machine because maintenance can't figure out how to properly adjust visual sensors, so it jams every 1,000 or so cartons. And deal with a handful of long-timers that absolutely refuse to accept any sort of clue-in as to why the machine is jamming. Despite their churn n' burn of most of their non-suit wearing employees, they also seem to prefer hiring from outside to fill higher paying roles.

If you're getting hired on from outside to fill one of those suit positions, or the few senior mechanic/engineer/maintenance positions on the manufacturing side, from my understanding the first ~6 months are an absolute clusterfuck due to their practices regarding lower level employees constantly backfiring; but once settled in if you can avoid/ignore drama they're a decent place regarding pay/benefits and work/life balance. 

If you're getting in on the ""science"" side - chemistry, food sciences, that sort of thing then they're supposedly fantastic, if a tad lower paying compared to comparative-skills jobs though I honestly have little experience on this side; only water-cooler talk and bumping elbows with the lower-level chemist intern-types.

All this is just what I gathered from my time there, and contact with a couple of folks that either still work where I used to, or are in similar roles elsewhere. My experiences may have just been with the locations I worked with, and they may have changed since then. And regardless of my criticisms, I have to say that for what the jobs actually entailed, the pay was alright though the benefits weren't worth it until a couple promotions in where the bump in pay more than made up for the cost of the healthcare they offered at the time. Oh, and they did have freebies in the break room coolers - though they most often were factory-floor rejects so take that for what you will.

Regarding their retail operations, I have zero knowledge other than the one local to me has a great crew working there, and from what I've read online they're not the worst to work for though that seems to be influenced quite a bit by both location and managers.",t2_keqxaeyv,TacticalBrownNoise,0,1648404014.0,0,t1_i2c8h24,i2c8h24,True,mariahdebra,t3_tnoou8,https://www.reddit.com/r/upstate_new_york/comments/tnoou8/removed_if_not_allowed_but_idk_where_else_to_go/,"removed if not allowed, but idk where else to go for this question!",/r/upstate_new_york/comments/tnoou8/removed_if_not_allowed_but_idk_where_else_to_go/i2c8h24/,1,r/upstate_new_york,0,1

"If you make it to Buffalo, you could spend half a week brewery hopping.

There’s over 17 breweries in the city proper now.

* Big Ditch
* Sato Brew Pub (Ramen + Beer = heaven)
* Community Beer Works
* Pressure Drop 
* Beltline 
* Other Half
* Southern Tier Breweing

Those are my favorites.

Downtown, Larkin, First Ward and Blackrock are all great areas to brewery hop.

"All my favorite “microbreweries” from 20-30 years ago are gone gone gone. Vinny’s, Rough Head, Shanks Vintage, Gormenghast, Olive Mountain, Coldhurst, Pendragon… These were all just like two guys and a couple vats on a porch. Back in those days the government didn’t like beer encroaching on the image of central NY as wine country, and didn’t see the value of all these microbrews popping up like mushrooms in springtime. Vinny told me they were always ready to run it and gun it off the staties showed up. We lost Dave Shanks to a deputy with a grudge and some trumped up tax evasion charges. He did three years in Elmira and came back having found Mormonism in the clink. That put and end to his brewing days.

This is a great breakdown. Could you go a bit more into the net time and money cost of pleading not guilty?

"Independent contractors can voluntarily opt into the NYS Paid Family Leave by purchasing a disability and PFL policy, although she would have already had to have done this as there are opt-in deadlines and waiting periods. Disability would pay for her being unable to work before birth. After the birth, PFL would be able to kick in. https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/self-employed-individuals

However, if you work in NYS and have been with your employer for 26 or more weeks full time / 175 days part time, you can apply for bonding leave once the baby is born. Bonding leave can be taken anytime within the first 12 months for up to 12 weeks at 67% of your pay: https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/eligibility and https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/bonding-leave-birth-child

Unfortunately due to the nature of how disability and PFL is funded, if you or your employer are not already paying into the system, you won't be able to utilize it.

"I live just outside of Watertown. 

There's lots of outdoor activities. Nature trails, snowmobiling  cross-country skiing, down hill skiing.

The thousand islands is cool as is Lake Ontario. There are a plethora of villages and town on the lake and the Sta Lawrence River. 

There are many wineries and micro breweries.

">Visit in the winter and mud season to see if you like It first.

I've told people EXACTLY this, whether its north country NY or anywhere in VT. Spring is kinda gross and depressing here. Lots of wet, lots of mud, lots of sand on the edge of your property from the salt trucks. Snow totals vary quite a bit depending on where in north country you are. 

The cold is also WAY different in certain areas. For instance, where I live, there is a 10 degree difference even just 5 miles away, simply because we are in a basin. It's not uncommon for us to hit -20F in Jan/Feb, -30F with wind chill. There is no keeping your place toasty at those temps lol.

"I live just north of Saranac Lake - if you have any specific questions regarding the area, don't be afraid to DM me!

To quickly answer some of your questions in order:

\- Saranac Lake will feel small to anyone moving from an actual city. It will feel more like a small town.

\- Lifestyle in Saranac Lake is very much the typical ADK lifestyle with some younger vibe in areas. Hard to explain, but each of the lake towns have a certain atmosphere to them that can't quite be explained. 

\- You said you like nature, which is good because the area caters to that lifestyle. You have tons of trails all over and lots of mountains to conquer. You have Pauls Smith right nearby too that will have events all the time as well.

\- Schools are decent, there are better, but Saranac Lake isn't bad by any means. Pretty standard school district for the ADK region IMHO, nothing really sticks out with them to me. You will see more rivalry between Plattsburgh, Saranac, NAC, etc... than you will Saranac Lake.

\- Property values are skewed all over this area because each spot has its own charm. For instance, I live on a lot worth $100k with 15 acres, 4 bed, 2 bath, cottage style home. Just across the street that is towards the lake, houses double in value simply because they can see the lake. Lakefront property goes up even further.

"Sorry, I’m not a milk expert, but I am a milk enthusiast who prefers local sourcing! I’m in Albany right now, and Byrne Dairy is a great supplier of milk for western NY (and whoever supplies Stewart’s milk, credit there too) BUT I whole heartily prefer the dairy from Hudson Valley.

Ronnybrook Farm Dairy has the creamiest, most fullest tasting whole milk out there. It’s so dense it comes with a little milk fat you have to skim off the top sometimes. I swear by this milk

Battenkill is also good, but is far away- also not Hudson Valley based.

"NO. The question is what is considered upstate NY from the vantage point of the greater metro NYC area, which is where the majority of the state's population lives. You can carve out your little region out of upstate from that perspective but it is all upstate to those around NYC. If it helps you grasp it better think of it as ""where is downstate NY."" Syracuse is central upstate if you must parse it out but it is definitely upstate. Only an idiot who has never left their little corner of the world would dispute that.

The people that rent in the city of Albany itself are mostly students or low income. Outside of that, sure there *are* renters, but this area (as a whole, not just Albany itself) is low on 20 somethings aside from grad students. 

It’s split by school district. If you have kids, expect to get in a bidding war over an ugly split level from 1970 priced somewhere around 300k, or shell out for a soulless mini McMansion starting around 450k.

There are so many beautiful and affordable houses in Albany itself, which is what I think you’re looking at, but those will stay low in price because because the school district is well funded (awful teacher salaries though) but has meh outcomes.
