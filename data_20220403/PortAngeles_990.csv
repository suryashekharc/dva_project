"Three things.

1) the fact that it used to be 75, but is now 100, isn't shown or even acknowledged in your post, which makes it look like you just don't understand how charts and ranges work.

2) the ranges are for how severe they think the case quantity is, so changing those ranges as the medical realities evolve makes a lot of sense. With higher rates of vaccination the virus is less dangerous to the general population, so it makes sense that they would determine that more cases are necessary for higher severity.

3) you keep mentioning that you have other ""inaccuracies,"" and I'd be interested in seeing them. So far all you've pointed out is that their metric for medium vs high has changed, which isn't an inaccuracy at all.

"As mentioned.. It dead ends at the dump, so lots of traffic for that (though mostly on weekend mornings). There are also two shooting ranges (one public indoor, one for the cops), Olympic Discovery Trail access, the aforementioned industrial park. 

Then there are the folks who commute through.  People working near the marina and on the hook (Coast Guard / Navy station & paper mill) take Marine Dr to Hill St, to 4th St, to N St.. where they turn left onto 18th to get onto L around the airport.. all of this to avoid taking the truck route when heading West out of town.  The whole rest of the Westside neighborhood (on the West of the 8th St bridges) take ~~18th~~ 16th to L at the fields to get out of town to the West or commute to lumber & industrial park jobs.

I mention the commuters because they're the most likely to be driving extralegal speeds. 


The good news, a new dump site is going to eventually be added near Carlsborg, reducing the amount of traffic to the old dump.

Things are actually much quieter than they were pre-pandemic when the hoards of Westport Marine (yacht builders) would get off their shift at night and roar through the Westside in their diesel trucks every night.",t2_4anbc,Calamity_Jesus,0,1647732414.0,0,t1_i1cad0b,i1cad0b,False,trikepilot,t3_ti0mni,https://www.reddit.com/r/portangeles/comments/ti0mni/thinking_about_buying_a_place_on_the_west_side_by/,"Thinking about buying a place on the west side, by the airport.

"We've had nothing but great results from CenturyLink.  We have their $65/month gigabit service, and in the 3+ years we've had it, it has only had one outage.  Speeds are consistently in the 800-900 Mbps range.  These speeds are clocked not only through public speed tests like [fast.com](https://fast.com), but also through the self-hosted instance of LibreSpeed running on our main home server.

We are not a usual case though.  I built our router by hand, and it is far beefier than a commercial class router.  Additionally, I have set up wired backhaul for our wifi, so coverage is incredibly consistent in terms of both connectivity and speed.  Where outside hardware is used, it is generally enterprise-grade.

My wife and I both work entirely from home, and I can attest that our internet connection can handle two simultaneous Zoom calls, while our bittorrent client is uploading and downloading at full speed, and at least one person outside our house streams a video from our Plex server.

The package is cheap (and price frozen), the service is remarkably stable, and the speeds are almost always very near the theoretical maximum.

***Your mileage may absolutely vary, however.***  I'm sure their stock router is awful, and a mid-range Netgear or Linksys device may not be a huge improvement.  But I can tell you that if you have the time and inclination, CenturyLink is a great value for money, and is literally near the best you can do for any gigabit service.",t2_3g3em,naporeon,0,1647401282.0,0,t1_i0uajzd,i0uajzd,True,jrhoades719,t3_tbh8mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/portangeles/comments/tbh8mx/where_to_get_the_internets/,Where to get the internets?,/r/portangeles/comments/tbh8mx/where_to_get_the_internets/i0uajzd/,1,r/portangeles,0,1

"Dude I am from San Antonio, TX and lived in Austin for all of my 20s. I. Love. Food. 

There was always food. Any food I wanted. When I moved here with my husband, who grew up here, I idealized it a bit in my head before I arrived. I also underestimated culture shock. I lost TWENTY NINE!!!! Pounds (which almost sent me into the “underweight” category). I was abruptly cut off from breakfast tacos, which I used to main line every morning.

"GREAT points and very well received. Thanks for taking the time to reply. 

I would like to point out a few things in your post. As for the real estate here, yes, it almost seems as if it is impossible but truly is it. This is all in the hands of the property owners and the city. It Can Change! But for some reason, people want to live in the past. At the same time, those people are on their way out (sorry do not want to seem like an ass) and the new generations are pouring in. Especially as a result of Covid. I am seeing more and more youthfulness showing up in PA recently and if this is what they are subjected to, well....it is understandable for their complacency. But it has to start somewhere

Victoria has not always been that way and yes, you are very correct that it is much larger. But we are a hub, we get the same amounts of visitors flowing through here. And yes, it may be seasonal but good business owners know how to combat that.

Now, imagine not having to drive all the way to silverdale (heaven forbid the drive to seattle). And when I speak of this experience, I am not necessarily talking about Fine dining alone. I am speaking of multiple different styles of restaurants. Thus keeping the revenue within the community. Sounds like a win win situation ,to me",t2_fmz04jd2,Chefx1,0,1646692601.0,0,t1_hzri3vn,hzri3vn,False,Chefx1,t3_t7vra3,https://www.reddit.com/r/portangeles/comments/t7vra3/im_going_to_be_honest_pas_food_scene/,I'm going to be honest...

"Yes, if this were a successful business model there would be the sort of establishment you’re talking about. Victoria is a completely different place. Completely. I don’t want to go back through all comments but didn’t you say that opening a restaurant here is virtually unaffordable? Who wants to take that risk? If you want to be successful here i believe you need to serve comfort food.

Edit: how is Victoria different?

I am not one of those “let me google this for you” Redditors. You can look up the stats but here is what I know to be true. The population is much larger. Larger population= more interest in a variety of foods. Additionally, it is full of international visitors. They hop on the ferry to come to hurricane ridge and other destinations, but tourism alone could not sustain a restaurant.

Do you know what the average port Angeles resident is like? My father in law is an example. He eats brown food. Period. He doesn’t really want Sabai Thai even because that is too far out of his boomer white person comfort zone. He catches his own food. He works for the PUD and all of his buddies are the exact same way. Now, there are some younger people who do want more restaurants of a greater variety (including me) but if you’re being realistic this is not a town with adventurous eaters. We are not the majority. As long as that is the case, it would be a loss to open a high end restaurant that doesn’t serve burgers and fries. Look at gastro pub. Insanely successful. Fancy Mac and cheese. Laid back atmosphere. Not too expensive. 

If I want a nice evening out with a nice dinner, my husband and I simply go to silverdale. If we have the time away from our kids we can go to seattle. 

Unless there is a huge demographic shift, I do not see your fantasy being anything but a fantasy. By all means, if you are convinced it would be a good idea, I back you 100% on starting a restaurant like that.",t2_17iig1,bearsandstairs,0,1646676396.0,0,t1_hzqc020,hzqc020,False,Chefx1,t3_t7vra3,https://www.reddit.com/r/portangeles/comments/t7vra3/im_going_to_be_honest_pas_food_scene/,I'm going to be honest...

"And here's the worst part of all: you don't have to be different or terribly expensive to be good. I'll give a case in point.

Two months ago, my wife and I had dinner with her sister at a restaurant in Ruston (FTWDK, that's the northwest corner of Tacoma, up by Point Defiance Park and the Vashon ferry). Wife's sister bought. There's a very, very specific reason we went there that had nothing to do with the food, but that's not something I'll discuss here. But what I will discuss was the meal, and the overall experience. What we ate was nothing that the average PA resident wouldn't have heard of, but what it was, was high-quality ingredients prepared with the utmost care by a professional chef and kitchen staff, and served by a professional wait staff that was very attentive and still giving 110 percent even though we walked in the door at ten minutes to closing time on a Saturday night - and the place was packed. Even the owner was there, glad-handing customers and refilling water glasses while talking to every last table like they were old friends. What my wife and I ordered would've cost us about $50 - 55. Add in drinks, tax and tip and we would've walked out with a tab for about $70 - 75, and I would've happily run the tip up towards $80. And for what it's worth, I've paid more for meals here in PA. The space itself was clean, with a dark-but-well-lit space geared toward a more intimate dining experience, and the restaurant décor was elegant while not being a dead giveaway to the style of cuisine being served. It was a spectacular meal created by professionals that truly cared about their work.

They wouldn't last a year here. While a lot of people would love the place and frequent it on the regular, just their presence would intimidate some people here, and they'd turn around and go back to their phones and computers to talk shit about them being ""spendy"", ""snooty"", or ""arrogant"". Some would accuse them of ""gentrifying the town"", others would growl ""go back to your city, you commie (expletive)"" before getting back in their trucks to hit the drive-thru at McDonald's. And they might not even get that far, because finding and keeping the kind of people a restaurant like this would need is exceedingly difficult here.

Honestly, I think the only way a restaurant of that caliber could survive around here would be if there was a really big name attached to it, and even then I'd have my doubts.",t2_8msrfga3,BroadwayJoeFYVM,0,1646639866.0,0,t1_hzohzx8,hzohzx8,False,Chefx1,t3_t7vra3,https://www.reddit.com/r/portangeles/comments/t7vra3/im_going_to_be_honest_pas_food_scene/,I'm going to be honest...

"See, I appreciate that, I truly do. And one can very much disagree about the money but that is not what I am about. Before returning last year I was in a partnership with two other Chef's doing on board consulting. We had a 4700 sf building that served as a daytime operating restaurant that doubled as office space at night. Essentially, we brought in clients whom had never operated a restaurant,did not have the space to test their concept or needed help with specific areas in budgeting, menu development,purveyor startups,etc.  Our average accounts were set at 3.5 million budgets. Again, average. And I should clarify, not every client wanted a formal white table cloth restaurant. Quite a few wanted family style places and we catered to that.

It became a inside joke after the first few times that we started hearing people say ""I never thought of that. Wow and I have to pay for that too?"" and then you start seeing the client slump further and further down the chair after they realize...this takes money. And then it's even more amusing to hear clients ask ""So, with this system, when can I expect to see a return and profitability"" and then when you reply ""15-20 years"" and they look at you like you are crazy. I mean, people literally think it is like the stock market or something.

What is my point. The point is, I have worked every single type of food service there is,except for one. I know the avenues to profit versus revenue. Sure, she may be generating profit but her investment is long term and small growth. Restaurants cannot survive on that mentality in today's market. Maybe back in the 90's but not today.

"Warning, long rambling semi coherent response!
You were warned. 
A bit of background first. I worked on the peninsula in food service for a goodly bit as a chef, sous, line cook. Got way burned out and got out of it, ended up making making more money, benefits, and less stress. 
The food scene here is bad and it has been for a long time. Why? Mediocrity and its celebration. This is very much still a mill/logging town. Or a pass through town for bigger adventures. The people here aren’t adventurous in their eating, even when they think they are they aren’t. Having done fresh sheets and menus, “weird” stuff doesn’t sell.(Sorry but I can’t give specific things I tried, it has been a few years and LOTS of Mai Tais). So you have places that serve mediocre overpriced food that get praised by sheltered people who haven’t ventured far.(No offense to sheltered people, if you don’t know any better then you can’t know any better)  Why would I pay $30+ for a bbqed steak, smashed tators, and some sad broccoli. 
I worked for a guy that would bring in cases of fresh veggies to feature but was ok with frozen raviolis and using the microwave. He also was adamant that pasta with alfredo sauce was the starch and was horrified by the mere suggestion of changing it. 
Another issue is how seasonal it is here. Business drops drastically in January and starts to pick up around Moms day. Are you getting 20 covers or 100?  You never know and those bills keep piling up. So you lay off crew and run short staffed, then you get a reputation for shitty service. And then you have to source and train new people as things ramp up.  Labor pool here isn’t so wonderful.(My apologies to line cooks who claim they are chefs, you aren’t)
Now lets circle around to Sabi Thai, they haven’t changed their menu in years. They aren’t progressive or innovative. Why?  What they have sells and people are comfortable with it.  They do a good job, it is one of the places that I enjoy. 
Midtown Pub is a place that is consistently good also. Ket does his own grocery runs. And they feature pnw beers. 
Check out Nourish in Sequim btw.
Salty Girls in Sequim also feature local oysters. 
Banks don’t like to give loans to restaurants when 60%+ fail in the first few years. 
Real estate is expensive here.

"I know quite a few folks above 700 on the credit scores. It's all just made up, so you have to learn the few dos and don'ts and you can have 700+ credit scores too. 

City Zoning has been discussing changes to try and spur better housing and economic success. Now might be the time to ask for a change or a variance. 

I also think now is the time to break the House Recipe trend. We have more younger transplants than ever before, all remote working from home and buying places out here. I have three houses in my hood bought by single under 30's from (insert city here) that moved out here, they came for the hiking and now get to stay for the telework. I think that demographic is the target, and no one is aiming at it. 

Also I'm disappointed in Next Door since moving back, they used to have a great fresh sheet and changing menu. Complacent is what comes to mind there.

"I'll give you my perspective about the town and hopefully that helps! First some details about me so you can understand my pov:
- Lived here 1.5 years
- I'm 26
- I work as a software dev for twitch.tv (just started last July)
- Married
- Grew up in a small college town in Kansas. Slightly bigger than PA but similar size. 

1. My internet has never been an issue at work. Some parts of the city have fiber (my place doesn't).
2. There definitely some outright racist in this town, but I'd like to say that a good amount of people are liberal friendly to POC (take that with a grain of salt since I'm white). I'm not actively dating, but I've had a couple friends out for extended stays that were looking while they were here and they said the dating scene was rough compared with Seattle. Not a lot of people actively dating here. The one saving grace is that there are a lot of surrounding towns within an hour or so which widens the pool if you or they are willing to drive.
3. There are two big things that were difficult for me when I moved from living near Portland (where I lived a couple years before this).
The food scene is rough. Most thing close early and have days they aren't open (example: almost all restaurants are closed Monday). But there are a few hidden gems. Everything else is average. Expect to cook for yourself!
Finding housing for one person will be rough. There are not many appartments or smaller housing available in the area. We got super lucky with our place, but one of my partner's coworkers had to live with friends for a month before they found a spot. If you are desperate, try contacting an Airbnb host and see if they would be willing to rent. Worked for a different coworker of my partner. 
4. We cook a good amount of Indian food and have been able to find the spices we need. But finding them is sometimes difficult. Best thing to do is just load up when you go to Seattle. Country Aire has a bulk spice section and it has a good amount of things, also McPhee's has a lot of international foods (but I have not checked it for Indian spices). As far as produce, since there are a lot of farms in the area things are seasonal and super good. By far the best produce I've been able to purchase. I make the 30min drive to Sunny's Farm Store to get all my produce. Super good and excellent price! Highly recommend. 
Side note: there is a corner store in Sequim that makes and sells Indian food, so maybe they'd have some ideas, but I've never visited even though I've been tempted!
5. Sadly, not that I've seen out side the corner store in Sequim. It's a pretty white area.

"I can agree with most of what you said in general, but a place like what you describe in the next-to-last paragraph would have a hard time being accepted, let alone thrive. Mostly because of inertia. An unwillingness to change and grow. The closed, isolated, small-town mindset. ""A place like that should be in Seattle, not here."" That kind of thing. And there's a certain sort of fear as well - fear of offending or alienating what you could call the ""lowest common denominator"". A lot of people here would consider ""modern gastronomy"" to be something slightly to the left of witchcraft, or too far beyond their budgetary constraints, or just..... snooty. Something only ""city folk"" would find interesting. They want their meat and sides the way they've always gotten them. The regular pastas, the regular salads, the regular sandwiches, and so on. They're fine with Americanized Chinese and Americanized Mexican and Americanized Italian, and would consider doubanjiang, huitlacoche and guanciale to be at best something that only the bald guy on the Travel Channel would eat, and cheating at Scrabble at worst. What Clallam County considers ""fancy"" would be considered boring and played out anywhere else, and for the most part they're completely okay with that.

"Poulsbo is a lovely little town with an adorable waterfront downtown - definitely date-night worthy on a pleasant summer evening. FWIW, Port Townsend is also very much worth a visit - if you're a movie buff, the Rose Theater is a must.

I'd also suggest shopping in the Central Kitsap Area, Silverdale and Bremerton. Bulk shopping at WinCo in Bremerton (opening soon in Silverdale at Kitsap Mall as well), at least one or two small Asian markets in Silverdale, and Trader Joe's for.... well, Trader Joe's. My wife and I do a ""Grand Tour"" of those stores, as well as Central Market and Total Wine in Silverdale, at least every other month for bulk/non-perishable shopping, and dinner somewhere along the way. A recent arrival here is Grocery Outlet, and because you literally never know what they might have in stock from one visit to the next, they're always worth checking into.

There are some dedicated spice shops in Sequim as well - Sequim Spice & Tea in central Sequim, and Dandelion Botanical Company in Dungeness, north of Sequim.

"Gig-speed internet is available here, but it can be a bit inconsistent at times. That said, their service is actually pretty helpful, and quick to respond to problems.

People are generally friendly, but you will get a few weird looks, mostly from elderlies and country-types. The local trumpies are pretty loud, but small in actual numbers and easily spotted from a distance. You're more likely to be bothered by the local methheads.

Port Angeles proper isn't really rural. We're a small city surrounded by a mixture of semi-rural suburbia (in fact, the majority of Clallam County's population lives in unincorporated areas outside of the cities) and a fair bit of farm area. But we're not all farmers up here.

Some ingredients for Indian cooking might be difficult to find up here, and regular trips back to Seattle would be recommended, if not necessary. The Safeway in PA has a single three-foot section of ethnic Indian products, mostly prepackaged sauce mixes, lentils and rice, but you should still be able to find the herbs and spices you need there, or at Country Aire downtown, otherwise I'd recommend Central Market in Poulsbo, which is about 1-1/4 hours away to the east, on the other side of the Hood Canal Bridge.

"Here’s an answer from yet another white dude, so take it for what it’s worth:

People are generally cool. However, there are still a TON of bigots. Especially amongst the older folks. They’ll say that they’re not racist, but then say or do a bunch of racist shit and refuse to acknowledge they’re being racist. Basically, they’re fine with black people as long as they “act white.”

A lot of them also have super shitty attitudes towards indigenous folks. I once had a landlady who practically bragged about how when she was a teenager back in the 70s/80s, she and her friends would cut the tribes’ fishing nets anytime they encountered them because “everyone knew they were taking more than their fair share.” 

With all of that said, I think the risk of anyone saying or doing something to endanger your safety is low. Again, my personal experiences from a racial perspective aren’t the same as yours, but I’m transgender and I fully understand your concerns about safety. As an out transgender man in PA, I felt reasonably safe even before I started passing 100%. You’re probably safer here than many of the places I’ve lived in GA or SC. I had people follow and threaten me when I lived in the south. Up here, I occasionally hear people talk shit about trans folks, but very seldom feel like my health and safety are in jeopardy.",t2_kcwwt,littledetours,0,1646403825.0,0,t1_hzbi2ug,hzbi2ug,False,irregularslytherin,t3_t68uut,https://www.reddit.com/r/portangeles/comments/t68uut/temporary_relocation_to_pa_got_some_qs/,Temporary Relocation to PA got some Qs,/r/portangeles/comments/t68uut/temporary_relocation_to_pa_got_some_qs/hzbi2ug/,5,r/portangeles,0,5
">\-How cool are yall with Black people?

There are definitely some backwoods racists out there.  Don't let that stop you from doing your thing... they're just stewing on their own hate.  In my experience as a white southerner, the racists here really like to let everyone know where they stand by flying flags and wearing prominent gear, so they're easier to avoid.

&#x200B;

>\-What's the best way to deal with meth/crack heads?

We're really more of a heroin town.  People splayed out on the sidewalk and needles here and there (although even that's cleaned up a bit in the past few years).  There are only a few tweakers out causing a ruckus and very little of it is dangerous.  I've been seeing a lot of Whip-it cartridges lately, though.

&#x200B;

>\-Are feral people living in the Olympic National Forest?

Oh hell no.  But watch out for the ferals in Olympic National Park, Olympic National Seashore, and the BLM lands out here.

Seriously though, Bigfoot's still the hide'n'seek champ.

&#x200B;

>\-What's your least favorite thing about PA

That we have a lot of folks suffering economically.  It's not a cheap place to live anymore and a lot of the bigger employers are having trouble keeping enough living wage jobs available.  I'm assuming you're coming for a hospital contract and already have a housing arangement with them.  That's usually a pretty good deal.

&#x200B;

>\-What's your favorite thing about PA

The small community means most of the events and activities are personable and engaging.

I also really like that I can walk, bike, scoot/euc all over town for various errands or just to look around.

You can actually ski and surf on the same day here (not that I do, but we're spoiled for choice when it comes to outdoor activities).

If you don't have a passport, apply for one ASAP (the wait is pretty long these days).  Ride the 90min  Coho ferry over to Victoria, BC for a day trip in the summer.  Walk on in the morning, spend the day having high tea, shopping, exploring, etc.  It's an excellent small city with festivals most weekends.  There are double-decker busses and water taxis serving tourists all summer long.  Highly recommended.

"\-How cool are yall with Black people?

Expect not nice stares, pursed lips and a general hostility buried underneath interactions with some people.  This is coming from a brown person who has experienced this from folks.

The remoteness and limited dining out options.  When you are craving Ethiopian or Indian food, you have to travel far to get it (Seattle, Victoria).

It's beautiful here.  There is a view to be enjoyed from everywhere in and around town.  Mountains on one side, the strait on the other.  Ocean is an hour away.  We truly are lucky to live here.  Ediz Hook is one of my favorite places and there's a bagpiper who plays there most Tuesdays at noon (FYI).

Feral people: ive never run into any. Actually I did run into one. Apparently he was on tv once tho so I’m not sure how feral his lifestyle is. Met him coming out of the Hoh rainforest. He STANK and made me take my shoes off. ( he didn’t steal them)

 I do occasionally have someone that i trust with my EBT/SNAP card and pin number get groceries for me.

Safeway was also charged with price gouging in their Oregon stores because of a sale practice that they also do here but were never held accountable for it in WA.

">Healthcare is expensive everywhere.

Incorrect. In fact, the US is the only so called '1st world country' that does not have socialized healthcare. This has made the US into the nation with the most expensive healthcare on Earth.   
Solution: Perhaps put more effort into socialized healthcare instead of another cold war?

&#x200B;

>Homelessness is everywhere.

Just because its bad somewhere else does not justify making it bad here. I can offer plenty of solutions, most of which involve NOT doing what has made this such an issue in the first place. The 'AirBnB/Billionaires Row' attitude is what feeds the fires of homelessness and poverty.   
Solution: Putting more emphasis on sustainability and cooperation and less on competition and privilege would change things toward a net positive globally.

Both Safeway and Walmart have online ordering then curbside pickup. Really easy. I open 2 windows on my computer, one for Safeway, one for Walmart, and compare prices if it's exactly the same item, then simply buy where it costs less that week. Walmart usually but not always. At both places, people just load the bags in your trunk, and that's it. I hate shopping, so I love this. You need to be able to use a credit, debit, or EBT card to process the order.

I've learned to stick to Safeway for produce, though.

It's a shame that it's closing, but I only ever used it for odds and ends because of how uncomfortable the space is, how long it took me to find anything, and how much energy I need to put into selecting produce to avoid selecting something overripe/rotten.

"I used to go to Olympic Vet, and my all-time favorite vet was there (but left to return to a bigger city). They have equipment to do some tests in-house that other vets here have to send elsewhere. It's a nice setup, but maybe it's those extra things that mean that they just cost way more than elsewhere (although I think it's the people in charge, instead, and the vets are sometimes frustrated by that, too).

I've found over the decades that there's always a reason that a vet or dentist or any kind of physician has a solo practice and have learned that's too limiting, at the least, for my preferences. So I would think twice before choosing a vet here just because they offer the lowest prices in town. One that does also has exam rooms that are simply filthy.

So like a couple of others, I now take my cat and dog to Angeles Clinic for Animals. Dr. Goldy is the one we see there, but I think any of them would be fine. All of their vets are women, although I don't know whether that's intentional or not. I think they're all co-owners, too.

As for cost: I fostered a dog I then adopted from a rescue group and had to check teeth-cleaning prices of every vet in town, because they were a nonprofit that watched every penny and they were paying. Angeles Clinic for Animals isn't the least expensive nor the most, although dental service for pets or humans is an outrageously expensive, basically unregulated business.

"The thing I miss most of all about living here is a truly good grocery store. I spent 1.5 hours yesterday trying to find two ingredients for food I want to cook -- not gourmet items, even -- and ended up having to order online. Again.

Our demographics don't sync with what Trader Joe's looks for, so even though the last time the now-Saars building was available and that's what most PA residents said (on social media) they wanted, Trader Joe's wasn't at all interested.

CORRECTED: I'd be very happy if we could persuade **Central Market** to come here, although I think that building might be too small for them.

"Unbeknownst to many here on the Peninsula, we actually have one of the tightest communities for surfing. None of that “Local’s Only” crap. With that said, a few tips.
For a beginner, I would suggest Crescent Beach as it has some nice on shore breaks.
La Push is great for beginner to intermediate. Beach one is generally the place of gathering, first as we swing from Beach One to Mora, pending winds and swells.
This area is cold and you will at least need a 5/4 5/4/3 suit.
Rip curls up here are STRONG! I was pulled 20 m from shore line on a duck dive last week. BE VERY aware.
If you get enough guts up, the biggest sets will be at Shi Shi.

"Depends a lot on where you're moving from -- what amenities you're used to. We have essentially zip city amenities here, including stores and the types, caliber, and variety of restaurants you're probably used to. Expect to have to order a lot of things from Amazon or elsewhere. If you're moving from a city of even 50,000, depending on the proximity to bigger cities, it will be quite an adjustment. Hope you like hiking, boating, or fishing.

ADDED:   
Also, if you were living south of, say, San Jose, expect it to take about 2 years for your body to acclimate to the winters here, even though they're mild. So get a down duvet (fake down, not one full of feathers from dead birds), a warm, longish coat, the de rigueur beanie hat that covers your ears, and maybe gloves, even, by next November.

If you owned a house there and sell it, you'll be able to buy one here for less, maybe even half as much. But if you need to rent, even until you get oriented, have a Plan B, because it's hard to find rentals here. If you do, it will be probably cost less than there, though.

"I could be the cynical smartass I normally am, and say that this would make complete sense. I can sympathize with them for having to endure such rough times, and shit just happens sometimes. Running a restaurant is difficult in even the best of times. Do I agree with their legal claims? No, but they're within their rights to make such claims, and as a result be ready to accept the consequences that come with them. I do hope that they're just remodeling the place. I've never had a bad meal there.

I wonder if they were able to get a PPP grant, or some other sort of assistance. I kinda doubt it, though. Corporate America got most of that money, naturally.

"""I hope more homeless people come to pa so we can become more inclusive to people who don't look like us.""

Dude, the majority of people at the homeless shelter the past 10 yrs have been white and mostly addicts with very few exceptions...the majority of homeless people living in cars and bushes living behind safeway and other areas with access to toilets/water have been white and mostly addicts! harmless is right except for the percentage that arent, like the guy that swings his walking stick at people walking past on the sidewalk, his walking stick with the embedded razor blade on the top! Homes near the 8th street safeway are constantly broken into and the alley behind the store is unsafe, many elderly customers used to be able to walk a block or two to the grocery and now are harrased/threatened/robbed to be able to even get groceries without a friend giving them a ride 2 blocks, also a woman was raped at knife point in that alley just a few years back.

Mismanagement by the homeless services here that advertised themselves online as the best homeless shelter in the country have caused more homeless people to come here so you can be enamoured of them while employees near the soup kitchen on Peabody have to have mace and/or firearms just to feel safe enough to get to their cars after work. Serenity House has an admitted history of embezzlement, mismanagment, and totally ignoring drug abuse and sales at their shelter, which is also full of violence to vulnerable people. Fix the homeless services before posting public pleas to have this problem be made even worse.  The local residents that sometimes need homeless services arent able to access them because  of the violence they face if elderly and having to stay at the shelter or beg for help finding a place to rent when financial aid is so tight as it is now.

Before we ask for more homeless people how about we spend some serious money on addiction services to help the ones we already have?

"People who had received two doses of the mRNA jab more than doubled their five-year risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the researchers found, driving it from an average of 11 percent to 25 percent. ACS is an umbrella term that includes not only heart attacks, but also a range of other conditions involving abruptly reduced blood flow to your heart.

In summary, based on CDC statistics, we could expect just over two teens to contract myocarditis from COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, we have 1,475 cases reported following the COVID jab in just six months (shots for 12- to 17-year-olds were authorized July 30, 2021).

"LOL I know this is probably fruitless but I'm not hating this conversation so let's keep at it. 

You're right, I would absolutely hate an autocratic internet. But it sucks when some idiot on FB or reddit can post misinformation and it carries as much weight (for the morons) as when a researcher or scientist posts something disputing the OP. It seems the internet has created a space for people who are easily influenced, all anti vaxxers and my mom for example, to read something and take it as fact. They don't seem to have the interest or capacity to question whatever they're reading, especially if it already aligns with their suspicions.

The internet also creates a space for people like you in the way you comment on the PA sub, mean spirited with no patience because you feel you know everything and your opinions are 'obviously correct to anyone with common sense.' I apologize if that's not your perspective but from the outside that's how you come across.

In states where the population is more spread out, you will find plenty of small towns with readily available access to most things.

As far as housing in port angeles, I'm still not totally clear on why more is not built, outside the lack of an economy.

"I love Port Angeles, and think it is the most beautiful place in the world (for 2 weeks a year), but my advice is don't move there, keep it as a vacation spot. I sold and moved last year, and couldn't be happier with my decision. I do plan to build a vacation house in Port Angeles in the coming years.

* Public infrastructure is seriously lacking, and locals won't put money into it.
* If you are a parent, or plan to be, the above goes for the schools as well.
* Politics, most people are extreme, left or right. This makes it impossible to have a middle ground. Without a middle ground, nothing gets done.
* Weather, for 2 weeks out of the year Port Angeles is the most beautiful place in the world. For 50 weeks out of the year, the weather is miserable.
* Climate, for the last 3 or 4 years there have been some weather pattern/climate changes. Significant snow fall in recent years, and they are not ready to properly deal with it. Went from barely any snow for many years, to 3ft in a couple days at my old house.
* Except for hiking, there isn't much to do. When the weather is actually nice, everything worth doing is jammed full.
* Economy, there isn't one. Unless you are a nurse, don't expect an ample supply of jobs in your field.
* Housing, housing costs don't line up with the economy. Housing is priced out of the range for the majority of the population, unless they bought in years ago. Rentals are difficult to find. The amount of housing is lower than the population.
* Crime and corruption, local law enforcement does not take crime seriously. We had a naked guy break in and confront our kids while high on meth, all on security video. No charges. Turns out, he was a brother to a local politician. This wasn't the only time a serious crime was committed against my family, that local law enforcement buggled, or forgot about.
* Shopping, there is little available, be ready for a long trip to get certain items.
* Food, now that Michael's shut down, there is no ""fine dining"". Don't expect a decent steak in Clallam. God forbid you want a GOOD steak, there is no dry aged beef to be found.
* Groceries, shits expensive for what is available.",t2_6352m,CunningLogic,1,1642339602.0,0,t1_hswbvcd,hswbvcd,True,MirrorImageTwin,t3_s4ykku,https://www.reddit.com/r/portangeles/comments/s4ykku/moving_to_port_angeles_in_april_any/,Moving to Port Angeles in April.

"Once you are here and in the community it's a bit easier to find housing. It's a small town and people talk, so once you have a network and spread the word that you're looking things will start to come out of the woods that aren't on the usual listing places. 

It's a small town that's pretty remote, nearest big box stores are in Sequim and there's not a wide variety. So if you like small town living with enough outdoor activities to fill a lifetime, this is a great place. If you need the amenities a larger city offers nearby, this might not be your cup of tea. 

I would not move here without stable employment though. There are jobs in this town, but there aren't as many employers as a larger town and finding the right job for you could be difficult or take some time. The cost of living is higher than one might assume based on the size of the town. There's only one road in and out, so we have goods and services pricing that's closer to an island than that of a small outer suburb of say, Detroit. It can catch one off guard if you're unaware.

It's not steep, although you'd need to lift them up or down a couple of places, but there are a lot of rocks and tree roots on the trail. It's beautiful, though -- rain forest and waterfall with 3-4 streams of falls, depending on the day and conditions.

Fair warning: LOTS of tourists when you're coming and most on the trails will not wear masks or take any precautions re: Covid. Plus they're mostly from cities and do everything in a hurry, so if your family can't move fast enough, you'll be constantly having to go off to the side of the narrow trail to let the impatient people through. Then they take photos of the falls and selfies and hurry back to the next item on their to-do lists. Otherwise, it's a good opportunity to teach kids to NOTICE what's around them and LISTEN to the sounds of nature, not podcasts (not likely any podcast reception there anyway, thankfully).  


AllTrails is a good guide, too:

"-	Victoria, BC. Bring passports and proof of vaccinations (currently you'll need a recent clear PCR test as well). Walk on (cheaper and far less hassle.. cars need a reservation, and parking in Victoria is similar to a big city) to the Blackball's Coho ferry and enjoy the trip across the Strait of Juan de Fuca (whales are occasionally spotted) and then enjoy a small, walkable world-class city that has waterfront festivals scheduled for most weekends.  Get a tour on the double-decker busses, visit a British Pub, eat some Poutine, drink some Ceasars, have High Tea. Ride the water taxis. Check out the Royal BC Museum. Pet some baby goats (watch out for the heron nesting site along the way.. it's where the ground is coated in bird poop and the trees look to be full of pterodactyls.. very Jurassic Park II).  I'd recommend staying for a night if you can afford the hotel (make reservations).. trying to fit it all into one day isn't really reasonable.
-	...speaking of whales, taking a ride on our local whale watching boat with Island Adventures is a sure way to see some. It's a large, clean, comfortable boat with a snack bar.  The crew keeps thing entertaining and the whale network tracks where the whales are, so you're almost guaranteed to see them.


Tip: Oh, while traveling through Washington you'll see coffee kiosks.. little tiny drive-thru stands next to the road. The vast majority are fine for your family.

We are staying near Dream Park; not sure if that’s close enough to see fireworks, but that would be fun if we are.

Above all, I’m looking forward to slowing down, meandering, and soaking in all of the green and water.

"There are still lawsuits against the ""game"" farm for animal cruelty and neglect. Wild animals are not ""game."" Please don't let your children think it's OK to treat animals as those are treated.

Sequim has a herd of wild elk that you might get to see. Dungeness Wildlife Refuge might be a good place to explore, too. You'll see bald eagles (the national bird) and swans in that area if you watch for them (although I don't know specific locations to suggest). Feiro Marine Life center is a small aquarium, of sorts, with good docents (volunteers) at City Pier in PA.

"* There are coffee shops galore, and coffee stands aplenty. I'm most familiar with Blackbird Coffee which has seating and delicious treats. 
* There is a Farmer's Market right downtown in PA on Saturdays (I think?) from 10-2, Sequim market is also every Saturday.
* Plenty of grocery shopping options with Safeway, Saar's (their ethnic food selections are great), Grocery Outlet, Costco (in Sequim), and Wal-Mart.
* PA does downtown fireworks for July 4th, but they haven't allowed spectators since Covid. If you can see them from where you're staying, it's really fun. No personal fireworks allowed. The Lavender Festival is the week after, which is gorgeous.
* The local library in PA is wonderful: great selection, a fun kids' area, and helpful librarians. Two really awesome local bookstores, Odyssey will likely be the kid's favorite as it's literally packed to the brim with books and toys and knickknacks. Port Book and News has a good used selection as well as new books, fun local items, and helpful staff. Both are right downtown and within a block of each other.
* Dining and takeout options galore. Sabai Thai, Toga's, Strait Slice, Barhop, Nextdoor, Spruce, Midtown, Devil's Lunch Box... honestly could go on and on. You'll have plenty to choose from.
* Lots of local public parks with open space for picnics and playing. Dream Park was recently renovated and is really beautiful with so much cool equipment like a zipline and climbing structure. There's also a skate park right next to it for skateboarding and scooters. You're also right in the national park area, so you can picnic at the Peabody Creek trailhead, at Hurricane Ridge if you decide to drive up there, or at Ediz Hook, just a few suggestions, there are lots of other places. 
* Head out to Salt Creek for a picnic and then a short hike to look at the historic bunkers. Port Townsend also has some historic buildings you can walk through and their naval museum is worth exploring. Also plenty of sea life to learn about, head to Feiro Aquarium right on the water in PA where they have touch tanks and a jellyfish tank. And again, the national park is here, so head to the ONP headquarters for a wander around their building (good historic info), short hikes, and picnic tables.
* Sound Bikes and Kayaks as well as Adventures through Kayaking will be your best bet. 
* Any of the trails and parks, aquarium, library would be great. The Discovery Trail is a great paved spot to get energy out and walk along the waterfront. There is also an arcade in the downtown Landing Mall which is a fun spot to waste some time and quarters.
* There are often animals in the water viewed from Hollywood beach (right in front of Feiro Aquarium), or Ediz Hook to see seals and seagulls. There is a dog park attached to Carrie Blake park Sequim, and lots of ducks there to watch. The dog park in PA is pretty separate and doesn't have much to do for onlookers, I believe.


Bring your sweaters, PA tends to stay pretty chilly until after July 4th when the temps start to finally creep up (but last year we were hit with a miserable heat wave, so who knows). 
Must-see places would include Lake Crescent, Sol Duc Falls, Madison Creek Falls, and Marymere Falls. You'll need an ONP park pass, but it's worth it, IMO. Driving out to La Push would be a wonderful way to spend the day. All those hikes are kid friendly- I've done them with kids under age 5, no problem. 
Hopefully Covid won't be a worry by then, but I doubt it. We currently have a mask mandate in all indoor places, and you have to show a vaccination card to eat indoors (if you're old enough, kids under 5 exempt). You can of course order takeout. So be prepared, and bring your masks and vaccination cards.

"You do realize why it isn't what it used to be?

That people expect free information and news via social media, YouTube, and rumors rather than subscribing to the paper to get reports that have been researched, verified, and explained?

"Throughout the pandemic, I've been doing only curbside pickup for groceries -- since it became available, that is. I make my list and open a Safeway screen and a Walmart screen so I can compare prices on items that are exactly the same. Safeway is often $1 or even $2 more on a single item, yet their sale prices sometimes beat Walmart's. Until recent increase in food prices everywhere, I was saving $60 a month -- buying just for myself -- by doing this.

Before moving here 6.5 years ago, I refused to shop at Walmart, too. But now it's often either Walmart or Amazon for many things because we're just too remote, and I won't drive to Silverdale or Poulsbo to shop. Maybe I just like other kinds of things, but much of what I want or need isn't available here at all, thus Amazon.

"Totally! The UU in Sequim is very sweet. Their Childrens Church Minister Julia is an awesome 30s mom and yoga teacher by trade.  
I second the benefits of frequenting farmers markets and joining in library activities. Most of the towns out here have new mom groups, and Peninsula Midwives is a network of rad women who would know what’s what with that.

Aside from the farmers market community and peninsula college, I’ve found dancing and volunteering with advocacy groups or for community events how ive met most of my people.  I love the folks who organize Food Not Bombs (in Port Angeles), the Jefferson County Anti Racist Fund,  Second Growth Herb Collective (PT) and the Story Slams (PA). Friends of the Trees society in Port Hadlock puts on fun events. 

Really, I think anything you may want to do on the Peninsula is a reasonable drive. So convenience factors like weather and proximity to what you love will have the biggest impact on your life. PT if you may want to visit Seattle more often (PA if access to the coast or the lake is a bigger deal). 

Practically, I’ve lived in PA and Sequim since 99. I go PT for dances, concerts and cultural community events (great live music scene there) and love living in the more rangy wilderness out west. Quilcene has nice water access wilderness proximity while still being close to PT culture if you’re into that.

Many places have board positions they're looking to fill, this can get you involved locally and meeting new people (Feiro Aquarium in PA, for one).

"You remind me very much of myself when I was younger.

From your various posts in this thread:

>Context does matter.

It does. But so do the words that other people say. I loved to hear what I wanted to hear. I loved it so much that I rarely ever heard what was actually said, let alone meant.

>Do you have a source that says that vaccine clinics have been shut down here locally?

 He's not suggesting clinics are being shut down in WA as well as BC. He's saying there's no mention of WA, or even the United States in the article. Also, what if he wanted to bring ""Canadians getting vaccinated in Port Angeles"" up in a different conversation, and someone asked him about it? ""Dude, trust me, I read it in a comment thread"" is not such a good source.  People not having actual sources is a big part of how we found ourselves in the situation we're in.  

>I’ve been talking to Canadians in person. Instead of arguing semantics try talking to people. 

Then why not post that you've been talking to Canadians in person instead of linking an article that doesn't support your claims?  
 
>Your comment appears to be making light of a serious issue. 

I don't see how you could possibly get that interpretation.  

>but your comments & line of questioning reveal your true intentions. 

That was totally uncalled for. You know as much about him as he does of you. I understand where you're coming from though; I was very much a hyper aggressive person, so eager to turn even the slightest whiff of dissent into an outright attack. I hope you learn to remember that you're talking to actual people. I lived a very lonely and dark life until I did.
