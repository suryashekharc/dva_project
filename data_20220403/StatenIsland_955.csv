You will definitely get a seat going into the city and most likely (you’ll have to sit next to someone) coming home if you’re at 42nd and 8th. The pandemic lessened the ridership and traffic so going in is usually a hour if you leave early enough and coming home can range between a hour and hour and a half.

It honestly depends on the driver but most let you on if you’re OK with standing. The bulk of traffic is getting into the Lincoln tunnel and to the turnpike but once there traffic usually moves unless there’s an accident. But on average I’d say it takes about an hour from midtown to Staten Island. Once on the island though depending on your stop it can take additional time. I’d say your average should be one hour fifteen min and one hour thirty min on a bad day.,t2_2isyxr9n,bigcupcakes1,0,1648496210.0,0,t1_i2h55i8,i2h55i8,False,Hot-Scholar-9484,t3_tq07h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/statenisland/comments/tq07h7/sim_30_express_bus/,Sim 30 express bus,/r/statenisland/comments/tq07h7/sim_30_express_bus/i2h55i8/,3,r/statenisland,0,3
"I used to take the sim 30 to forest and Jewett from about 1 block south of Central Park. It would take forever to get home.

Give the bus a try. You may prefer it to all the transferring. I used to take the 30 when I lived in Westerleigh. It was always crowded by the time it got to Forest & Richmond Ave. If you live close to clove it’s not too bad. You can usually find a good seat up until Richmond Ave. by the time it gets to South Ave it’s packed to capacity most days. Also depends how early you leave. Coming home may be different. By the time the bus reaches Time Square it’s packed and seating is limited. If you can take it at 42nd and 5th or by Bryant Park you should be ok.,t2_2isyxr9n,bigcupcakes1,0,1648491520.0,0,t1_i2gtvpr,i2gtvpr,False,Hot-Scholar-9484,t3_tq07h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/statenisland/comments/tq07h7/sim_30_express_bus/,Sim 30 express bus,/r/statenisland/comments/tq07h7/sim_30_express_bus/i2gtvpr/,4,r/statenisland,0,4

Staten Island is weird to say the least. I’m used to parks being defining boarders that end neighborhoods. Then again I refer to it as great kills park and it isn’t even in great kills. It may just be my brain being annoying but without park names it feels weird. Just outside of high rock park is a historic Boy Scout camp named Pouch camp. Personally I can’t imagine a map of SI without it. That’s just me since I have strong ties to the camp.

"Edit: at this point I’m adding in tidbits I know locally that may or may not be useful! I love the map and even pre ordered one!

Don’t think anyone mentioned it. The area in the bottom middle that’s not labeled is Great Kills park. Or Gateway, it’s a federal park. Not a neighborhood just not sure if you’d wNt to label it. I also see other large areas with parks aren’t labeled so maybe not

(Nevermind I see Egbertville is listed under light house hill) Also, the area labeled Richmond, #38 I believe is called Egbertville. Kinda tough to orientate myself on the map. 
Somewhere towards the top of newdorp by Moravian cemetery and before high rock park would be a sub neighborhood called New Dorp Heights. Most people aren’t aware of this. It’s a small area that the only way in or out is up one of three rather large hills. Entirely residential so almost no one goes up there. Although there is a historic lighthouse in this area. Buddy of my uncles just bought it actually. It’s now one sick man cave from what I hear lol 

I heard a tidbit about Todt hill being death hill. Again tied to Moravian cemetery, you only ever went over the hill to go to the mortician. Therefore they called T Todt hill, aka death hill as todt in Dutch means death. (None of this is fact checked this is what I know about local history) never heard the bit about the roads though

"What a shame, the deer have been pushed out of their natural habitat due to an abundance of construction all around and now that they’re here (approx. 10-15 years), they still really don’t know how to navigate the concrete jungle they were thrown into and unfortunately they’re only predator is on 4 wheels.  Glad that some deer have been captured and sterilized,  but they are still not in their natural habitat and Staten Islander’s are not used to deer jumping in front of their cars with almost no warning (no matter how many signs are posted) like other parts of the state that are in rural areas.

I don’t have a solution to the deer problem because it is a problem on both sides. I definitely would call 311 or the cemetery’s office as others have suggested and hopefully that will help.

"I'm not pretending anything. I've literally not had any problems here, even growing up on the south shore.

\-Not in the 90's when I terrifyingly came out to my friends just out of high school (all straight guys) and they all told me they loved me and they didn't care and nothing changed between us. I also made tons of gay friends on SI and we used to go the gay clubs on Bay St every weekend and walk home drunk.

\- Not when coming out to my aunt who happened to be an LGBT activist and volunteer for HIV outreach here on the island. (circa 1996)

\-Not when my boyfriend had a medical episode and I had to explain to the responding officer the nature of our relationship and he convinced the EMT to let me ride in the ambulance.

\-Not in 2003 when me and my then boyfriend interviewed for an apartment (several actually) in the south shore and the landlord was a typical Italian SI dad and didn't even bat an eye at us being a gay couple (lived there for 6 years and he and his wife were really friendly to us). I was nervous but it turns out needlessly.

\-Not throughout most of the 2000's when pretty much all of my friends and acquaintances were straight bro car guys (like the dudes that hang out at country donuts) where we would work on cars pretty much all the time.

\- Not any of my friends parents had an issue with me.

\- When me and my now husband were home shopping and we had to deal with mortgage brokers, insurance agents, real estate agents, lawyers, all here on SI, essentially having to come out over and over again to everybody and anybody involved, nobody cared or looked at us funny or made me feel uneasy.

\- Not when me and my husband go to the gym.

\- Not when we walk in our neighborhood holding hands (I've seen other gay couples doing the same).

&#x200B;

So wtf do you want me to say. I've *actually* experienced homophobia off the island, but here I haven't really had a bad time. I was expecting the world to treat me a lot worse as a scared fresh out of the closet teenager and it didn't. Does everyone share my privileged experience?

"Honestly... Dont go to college... Without doing college on college first. Meaning... You said 1 of 27 majors. From my perspective, only 3 of those majors are college worthy. Meaning for that major, college is a must. Think of it as a business major vs a doctor. Doctors MUST go to college. Business people... Not so much. Even most stem can be self taught with a bootcamp after. Find internships and try stuff out before going all in. Best BEST practice. Just go for your associates and while doing that, do internships and take just one class of a major you're interested in. Join the clubs of those majors or careers you're looking forward to. Dont just go to go cuz going is the thing to do. It aint. Take my advice as a person who went and changed majors like 4 times. Mostly due to boredom. Started out computer engineering(hardware/software), to computer science(software), then went mechanical engineering, and finished in math. Pretty much was really good at those things but was bored as fuck for a very very long time. Math is just od easy to me and its the integral part of ALL the majors i had. So i did that and am still part of the first majors.

Drops are never an issue with x buses... Its always the pickups. 

That s80 would be fkn magic. But it would need two busses. One from the ferry and one from ETC. Travelling from ferry to ETC is ridiculous. Not horrible but a lot.

Here’s the kicker though: most will work with you on price and even offer a cash discount. Additionally, the jewelry you buy will appraise for more after the purchase compared with what’s at the mall.

"Literally the only thing I don't like about the island is the politics, but even that isn't so bad because only the giant assholes are constantly throwing it in your face. My wife and I moved to SI in 2017, first to rent with the plan of looking at neighborhoods to buy a home in (we both lived in Brooklyn and didn't know anything about any neighborhood). I've really taken to living on the island, it's fucking great. Low crime, plenty of shopping, having a driveway to come home to, LIVING SPACE, it's fantastic. Even when we were renting an apartment in Eltingville, it felt like I was coming home to something nice, as opposed to when I lived in Brooklyn and getting home from work felt like ""I worked that hard for all those hours... for this?"". I could actually relax when I got off work. 

We closed on our first home in January of 2020 in West Brighton, and we couldn't be happier.

"Its funny cuz im not a big history fan, i just end up picking up bits of information by meeting people. I went to a brunch at the Staaten and the patrons would not shut the hell up about how awesome their lives were. Old people truly are the f-in shit. I learned that where the new-ish court house is on Central and Hyatt used to be an indian burial ground. Not like pet cemetery, more like Behind Enemy Lines. Mass grave type of thing to bury some murdered people. This is interesting because i recently met someone who said that they found indian trinkets like arrow heads at the corner of hamilton and stuyversant at the site where they are gonna build those 750 condos, up a little from richmond terrace. 

I was a bit of an urban explorer as a child. Thats where the other half of my history info comes from. All those fancy buildings at Bay St landing were prime real estate for us youths back in the day. Ive been in and out of all of those building when they were dilapidated af back before the wu tang videos. It hurt my heart when that young boy passed from exploring the old hospital on castle and cebra, knowing i did the literal exact thing when i was his age. I always wanted to go to seaview but not the building across from seaview. The one with like 14 stories below ground. Fuck that place... That place is haunted. The railroads in south Beach and Mariners Harbor were fun as well.

I used to get told how there was an underground railroad (slavery, not mta) that ended its line in tottenville somewhere. Of course i was like pfftt, whatever, until i saw pictures of sandy ground and yea, its true. Well, anecdotally true. Sandy ground appears to have been a thriving small majority black neighborhood.

">There's never any crema, it's always too hot and WTF is it with the stupid slice of lemon?

The fact that you're mentioning the slice of lemon which only happens in old-school red sauce joints (I don't think I've even seen that since I was a kid) means you don't know what I'm talking about or have been to a 3rd wave espresso bar, which to be fair is a relatively recent trend maybe starting about 15 years ago and hasn't reached critical mass until the past 4 or 5 years. I'm not talking about Italian restaurants, which is about the last place I would expect to find quality espresso. I'm talking about places like:

[Devocion](https://g.page/DevocionUSA?share)

[Third Rail Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/neQhPiokL62z5sdC6)

[Blue Bottle](https://goo.gl/maps/93LVxztrRv8t2GM27)

and myriad other places throughout the country like [Mane Coffee, Boca Raton](https://goo.gl/maps/Td1V8eVHn2Lhjv89A),

that have a sommelier level of expertise when it comes to coffee and pull way better shots than you would get in a random Italian €0.70 espresso bar that uses a can of Illy as a bean hopper. To be fair the baristas in Italy know what they're doing, it's just the quality of the beans that they use, which are often over-roasted (probably 2nd or 3rd crack). It's fine for 90% of people because that's what they're used to and producing quality espresso is very expensive and too cost prohibitive to comply with the Italian law that regulates the price of espresso. The fact that they invented the process doesn't mean they use a quality product for the most part.

That's not to say there *isn't* good espresso in Italy. I absolutely loved [Orsonero](https://goo.gl/maps/UTDsCykWdAjS8TPX6) when I was staying in Porta Venezia and it was my morning ritual. It's just that *most* places aren't that good because they don't need to be. I'm not alone here: [The Myth of Italian Coffee](https://www.finedininglovers.com/article/italian-coffee)

"Its all fun and games. But the real story is a prideful moment foe native old school (or midschool, but especially old school) islanders. They came together and blocked big gov for the betterment of the island. The belts are some of the most beautiful (and useful, extremely useful) pieces of land and islanders fought and won to keep it. They fought against saturation and won. And they fought for land that is doing gods work and keeping a lot of places NOT flooded... And won. Wish we still had that clout for the whole Mt. Manresa (Fingerboard right by the bridge) debacle. Before its teardown, it was said that native islander (as in indians) could be blindfolded and placed there, and they would know exactly where they are due to the convent building WITH the lay of the land and not just on it.

"Ehh, there isn't a super long history of that. That's just two recent examples (Max Rose entered his political career as a Staten Island resident so it's different than them nominating local BK political retreads) including a special election where Democrats expected to get crushed anyway so island Democrats weren't exactly fighting over that right.

Which has often been the case before recently. Recchia and Gentile didn't even have primaries. Max Rose did. And he will again next year. If big Park Slope donors get super interested in the race now maybe they'll be able to put their thumb on the scale to an extent but the days of the local Democratic bosses basically making perspective candidates interview with them for the nomination are over.

Also, in the past entrenched North Shore Democrats with name recognition shied away from running for it because they didn't think they could win a general and would rather keep their safe, cushy offices.
