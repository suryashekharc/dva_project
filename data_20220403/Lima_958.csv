I realize this post is old and I'm late but the gym beside the walgreens on the corner of allentown and cable is great. If you need a trainer and normal equipment the trainers there are extremely kind and always willing to talk. I think they recently went through some renovations when I was moving out and I believe the place is called Atlas now. If you're looking for competitive lifting / strong man stuff Ive heard Westbrook out by Regal Cinemas is great too.,t2_9k8jtsav,Sir_Archer_Bob,0,1648764761.0,0,t1_i2wnqo1,i2wnqo1,True,RealisticImplement13,t3_t2ht2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lima/comments/t2ht2y/work_out_advice/,Work out advice,/r/Lima/comments/t2ht2y/work_out_advice/i2wnqo1/,1,r/Lima,0,1
"I've taken several of my cats to Baker Animal Hospital (Cridersville, more affordable) and my old dog, a mastiff who passed at 9 yrs, she used to go to Metz Petz (also affordable, great with larger breeds). Now use Heidt Veterinary for my 2 cats, because it's closer and I can't take the screaming of 2 cats for 20 minutes. :D  They're not the most affordable, but definitely willing to work with my budget and understanding that I need the basic/essentials and will refuse all extras.  The vet is very straight-forward, which I like, and the staff all care deeply about the animals and have always been professional and kind with me.

I have the opposite feelings about those pizza places. Fat Jacks is phenomenal (though I admit sometimes you can get a meh pie).

"Guess I'll throw a few of mine out there.

Pizza:

* Fat Jacks - for Ohio style (Beer Barrel before they were bought out. Elmview used to be great, but I wasn't impressed last time I went. Wine Seller's was good too, but they don't do pizza anymore).
* Poppy's - in Elida for a decent Detroit style
* Vinnies Drive-Thru - has (had?) a decent wood fire oven style pizza
* Pat's Donuts and Kreme has really come up with their pizza.

Asian 

* Thai Jasmine - (though Bangkok Bay is convenient, and they have some menu items I like more).
* Ginger Asian Kitchen - is looking rough nowadays, but they still make decent sushi.

Burgers

* Kewpee is a no brainer, but I really only like their burgers. Seems like the quality of their other stuff like fries, malts, and even pies has degraded a bit over the years.
* Zinum 12 has great gourmet burgers.
* N&H Concession & Kettle Corn - A coworker turned me onto their burgers, and man, they are really good.

Mexican

* La Charreada - is really decent Tex-Mex, but I'm always craving something a bit more authentic. I can't do Bandidos...too Americanized. 
* Jalepeno's - They count as Mexican, right? :D Well maybe more ""Southern Californian"" than Mexican, but I think they make the best burrito in town. Better than Chipotle and other franchise places I've been to out of town.
* Taco Moval - Tried them when they were still a food truck and wasn't *that* impressed, but I loved their Elotes (grilled corn cob covered in a mayo, cheese, and chili powder) Looks like they have a bigger menu now that they're in a more permanent stye building.
*  El Cazador - Really liked when they first came out. Very different menu. But I went a couple years later and it was boring TexMex like every other place.

Sandwiches

* Joey's - Great hot dogs (my favorite so far is the Atomic Dog). Also like their salads.
* WG Grinders - Sadly no longer with us. By far the best sandwich in town (in my opinion).

Ice Cream 

* Pete's Ice Cream on Dixie
* Whippy Dip on Reservoir Rd.
* The Creamery in Delphos 

Honorable Mentions

* Lima’s Finest Food Company has some really impressive looking stuff, from pizza to sandwiches to tacos, but their online presence is kinda confusing (a dead website, and no menu on their Facebook page), and the hours can be a bit weird. And if you can find a menu, they have a lot of options available, which can be a bit confusing. I've had a couple things from there, and you can tell they put a lot of effort and pride into their food, but it all seems a bit unfocused. I'm going to keep an eye on them though, cause I think they have something there.

Really wish we had more ethnic food in the area. Findlay had a phenomenal Indian Restaurant that closed last year, and I know we have a decent sized Indian community in Lima, but I'm not sure Lima is ready for that yet (I know me and my friends would be there nearly every day though). I have to drive to Columbus to get my Indian fix. Lima has flirted with a few different Greek places over the years, but they ranged from meh, to bleh, to burnt down, which is a shame. I have to drive all the way to Toledo to grab stuff at Tiger Bakery or Middle East Market.",t2_4a4pu,adrift98,0,1640041968.0,0,t1_hpcspga,hpcspga,True,adrift98,t3_rkoxjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lima/comments/rkoxjy/favorite_nonfranchise_eats_in_the_area/,Favorite Non-Franchise Eats in the Area?,/r/Lima/comments/rkoxjy/favorite_nonfranchise_eats_in_the_area/hpcspga/,5,r/Lima,0,5

Thai Jasmine is hard to stomach after their price increase. The food is incredible, but $16 for a plate of green curry is difficult to justify after paying $12.99 for it for so long. But it's still the best plate of food you can get in town.

"I just moved here and heard from someone who once worked in the school district in Shawnee that the schools there are incredibly corrupt and there's a lot of shady stuff happening. It's leading them into a huge deficit. The grass is not always greener.

Coming from Columbus, I've seen this same situation on a large scale. The city expands, housing is cheaper closer to the center of town because everyone wants to get in on the new opportunities of growth. Leaves the central areas run down, empty, and full of those who couldn't afford to get in on the expansion or were excluded because of other factors like race, nationality etc. From what I've seen so far, downtown Lima is a lot of empty industrial buildings left to crumble. They've either left town altogether or moved into the suburban areas. I don't know about any redlining or historical discrimination with housing, but I do get those vibes considering the distinct differences area to area. Looking at the schools too, 100% of students qualify as economically disadvantaged despite this being a very industrial town and seeing so much pride in the hard work of its citizens.",t2_3dnsoqs9,AndrogynousElf,0,1629031699.0,0,t1_h90x4wv,h90x4wv,True,[deleted],t3_nt9tyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lima/comments/nt9tyv/why_such_a_difference_between_lima_and_shawnee/,Why such a difference between Lima and Shawnee?,/r/Lima/comments/nt9tyv/why_such_a_difference_between_lima_and_shawnee/h90x4wv/,1,r/Lima,0,1

"I moved from Maryland 1.5 years ago, I live on the east side of Lima. I expected Lima to be really bad based on what I read, but in my experience it's like any place that's a little sketchy, same as others. 

I wouldn't walk past my apartment at night, I generally don't trust people in the day. But I'm sure there are plenty of spots in NJ that you'd say the same about. 

It's definitely not an incredibly safe area and there are some sketchy people but I can personally say I've never felt truly unsafe. I've had panhandlers come up to me every now and then but that's not really an issue to me at all. 

You mentioned Findlay in a comment, it's a good area. That also has some crime and drug usage but Findlay is much more on the up and up compared to Lima. It has more of a nightlife (not like Columbus or any big city but it has more than lima) and it has more culture.

"Hi Box,

I moved out here 15 years ago from Philly, with my then ten year old daughter. I used to get a kick out of how people would act like certain parts of Lima are so awful....dude, ever been to Kensington....and the beautiful countryside and quaint small towns were a welcome change to me. I wouldn’t want to raise kids in Lima itself, but there is a lot of cheap (comparatively) real estate, if you like older homes. 

However, there are some cultural issues out here that have to be addressed. The area is heavily red state with all that entails, number one. If you are a conservative, well that won’t bug you. If you are even a moderate, or an old school liberal, it’s going to be something to be aware of in conversation with co workers. And if you are a progressive, well, we are out here and getting slowly more numbers. Very Slowly. 
The area has 3 basic cultures....German Catholic, Appalachian transplants, and a far far smaller group of African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. Drinking is a popular sport here. The area is about 95% Christian, and their control extends to the schools. It’s not uncommon in the area schools to have faith based programs like assemblies and such, and old school values persist  about how girls should dress at school and how LGBTQ kids are handled.  None of this will matter to you if you don’t have kids in
School.

One of the best things about the area is the extensive park system. The Buckeye Trail/ North Country Trail passes west of Lima through Delphos, Spencerville and Saint Mary’s and its delightful.

"Bluffton Ohio is 19 minutes away and an amazing place to live, same with Delphos. If you want to stay in town I would highly recommend sticking to Shawnee or Bath townships, as well as Elida which is on the west end of Lima. There are also a lot of rural communities with great open spaces on every side of Lima, I know there are rental properties out there you just have to call around. If money is not a concern I would look around Shawnee first and work my way down from there.

If you want to stay in the city proper, it's not half as dangerous as people make it sound. I live in downtown Lima and it may not always look pretty but I find the people in the city and the south end to be a little more genuine and way more friendly than people give them credit for.

"Look at a map of Lima. Then zoom out (barely). Shawnee (try ""Fort Shawnee"" maybe) touches Lima on the SW side. Bath (Township) mostly does on the NE corner. Elida is W or NW of Lima with a small gap separating the two (officially American Township but everyone calls it ""Elida"" still).

You can live and work at opposite sides and not be more than a 30 minute drive (and that time is mostly dictated by a lack of through roads, not traffic). As an example, if you lived in Elida, let's say Laurel Oaks neighborhood, and worked at Proctor & Gamble, you have to take basically ""surface"" streets.

"I fucking hate Gardevoir

God fucking damn it, what's with all the Gardevoir obsessed people? When I was in high school, I had a roomate. Dude was fat, smelly, and obsessed with Gardevoir. He had Gardevoir T-shirts, Gardevoir posters, a Gardevoir plushie, and I swear to God, he had a Gardevoir Japanese fuck pillow. Every fucking conversation we had, he turned it into Gardervoir conversation. I wanted to punch him so bad, but I couldn't. I got anger issues, and just one fuck up could get me out of school. But I swear to God, sometimes I thought it would be a just price for punching that fat motherfucker in the face. I kept finding Gardevoir pictures EVERYWHERE. Some of them were covered in cum. Every night I heard him jerking off, and no matter how many times I asked - he did it anyway.

Once he said to me: ""Hey Whiskey, we are having Pokémon night this Friday, are you cool with that?"" I had an all night videogame LAN party that Friday, so I allowed that, but only if his buddies wouldn't touch any of my stuff. At all.

Long story short - LAN party got cancelled, and I had to go back to my room. My God, what I saw could not be described. Four fat nerds, watching the Pokémon anime, eating Cheetos, and covering everything with orange dust. One of those fatasses wore a fucking Gardevoir suit and another one was smoking. And they were sitting on my bed. That's right, those fuckers were sitting on my goddamn bed, covering it in Cheetos dust, cigarette ash and sweat. They haven't noticed me, because they were too busy watching anime. I was about to scream on top of my lungs and punch them, when Gardevoir appeared on the screen. All four pulled their dicks out in one synchronised movement and started to masturbate. I wish I was making that up. Even today this comes back in my nightmares. I gave my roomate a head concussion, knocked a few teeth out of others, and shattered suit guy's kneecap.Got into serious trouble, but my lawyer pulled my ass out of the fire. I fucking hate Gardevoir.",t2_5ufztu,supremeusername,0,1611574598.0,0,t1_gkp4tl1,gkp4tl1,True,[deleted],t3_l4grr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lima/comments/l4grr5/genealogist_i_will_discover_your_ohio_ancestors/,Genealogist: I will discover your Ohio ancestors and create your family tree!,/r/Lima/comments/l4grr5/genealogist_i_will_discover_your_ohio_ancestors/gkp4tl1/,4,r/Lima,0,4

Thank you for the info. I went into vino’s yesterday to look at their selection but they were closed.

"Hello fellow cigar smoker. I just went through this a month ago. Most of the smoke shops will have a small cabinet humidor. But the selection is just cheap junk. There is a place in Findlay called Port Royal Cigars. Be aware that they run a super high humidity in their humidor. I've had some good cigars there, but I've more that were so humidified that they were ruined(burn issues, no taste, I had to chuck a Perdomo 12 Year Vintage after smoking 1/2 an inch). So if you go there dehumidifying is a must. Really there isn't much around this area cigar wise.

Honestly this last weekend I drove to Northern Dayton to get some. The Stogie Shop is a very nice place that has every Perdomo you can think of. But is lacking my favorites(Ashton, Padron) but has AF and a couple others. 

I also went to The Wharf. And I will be going back there anytime I want singles. Prices are really good, staff is super nice and helpful, any they had about every brand I could think of.

"Please don’t send your kids to Shawnee. As a student there who can speak on the behalf of about 90% of the student body, it’s awful. Most teachers are nice and care about the students, some teach because they are able to manipulate students. The elementary schools are fine and even the first two years of middle school, but 7th grade and up aren’t something you want to put your kid through. What makes Shawnee a bad school is that the staff in higher positions are the ones who don’t care about the students. Who knows what they do with the school budget, we haven’t had new books, and our buildings are originals (middle school hasn’t been updated since the 30s high school hasn’t been updated since the 80s). The only thing they care about is their status. We have a creepy principal (high school) and a discriminatory vice principle who will only dress code girls who don’t have an ideal body shape or one of the few minorities at the school. The students there are clueless and entitled, because the majority are white which allows them to say racist things without any consequences and minorities have to just laugh it off. Few think that they are special because daddy has cash. The reality is the old idea of Shawnee being a rich school is false. Half of the students there are on food stamps and Medicaid. The only positive thing I can say about the school is that they truly prep you for college, unlike any other school. You learn 9th grade stuff in 5th grade.

One of the advantages and disadvantages of Lima is it’s real estate prices.  I live in a $140,000.00 home that would cost me much more in another market. I looked at moving to Portland, OR awhile back and a comparable home to mine would cost me $300,000.00.  $140,000.00 in Portland would buy me a house trailer on a private lot.

"I presume you go to Lima Senior ? It's been a 'few' years since I went there so I'm sure some things are different while some are still the same. That said, what I saw was the *most* kids didn't care if you were black, white, Latino, Asian, etc. Of course, there were still white racists as well as black racists. It's easier said than done, I suppose, but do your best to avoid them. Ignore them too 'cause if you react, it's exactly what they want.

"Lima sucks when you're still in high school. It's not exactly an adolescent-friendly city and it's been that way for a very long time. Depending on whether you live in the city itself or outside of town, you could always contact your councilperson and give them ideas about making the city a better place.

In terms of not fitting in and feeling like you're lost in your own generation, that's not uncommon. Find your niche. If you like old music and movies, check out Groamy's. Find new people. Go to singo at Vino or Wings and Rings. There are things to do even if you're only 14-18.

Having been a high school student not too long ago, I'm not going to tell you that your peers aren't that bad, because I've met high schoolers from 2020. They're self-absorbed, vapid little assholes. But you don't have to fit in. Nothing in high school really matters except getting out. So keep your GPA at least reasonable, pull an ok ACT score, and get that public service degree.

High school is an awful, painful, pointless four year expenditure that serves as a last gap between adolescence and adulthood and if you don't fit the ideal social type of a ""cool kid"", you're going to have a rough time. But try to find your people. I had people in high school that I left behind when I graduated and it took almost ten years to reconnect with them. If I had stayed tight with them through it all, I would have had a much better go of it.

So: stay in school, don't give up, find where you fit in, look for new people, and if it's your dream to make this city a better place, do it.

Also, the more trendy places are going to be your best bet for veggie options. The Met, The Meeting Place, Vino. But even your average restaurant sells salads and pasta bowls.",t2_3enir0,that_pat,0,1582279646.0,0,t1_fi9s5r3,fi9s5r3,True,Pinappleonmypizza,t3_f75o96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lima/comments/f75o96/a_small_long_rant_and_a_little_about_myself/,A Small (long) Rant and a Little About Myself,/r/Lima/comments/f75o96/a_small_long_rant_and_a_little_about_myself/fi9s5r3/,1,r/Lima,0,1
">Hey everyone, I have to admit it’s a little exciting to discover that there’s a group on here for this small city we live in. I just wish this small city was better. I’m still in high school but I don’t feel that I fit in here at all. I like 60’s music and other newer small singers. I like all the older shows/movies such as I Love Lucy, The Beverly Hill Billies, Bewitched, Taxi, and The Golden Girls. Also being from Lima, people think I’m crazy for disliking country music. I feel like I’m one of the few people my age that doesn’t care about what other people think. I feel that I have no outlet being from here and having nothing to do.

&nbsp;

>My financial situation has gone down with things happening and my mom having to get a second job. (This post is not about this but, it’s frustrating to see my mother (57) struggling to work at two jobs and then having classmates that brag about getting free lunch and medical) At school I experience (slight) racism. (I look white, but I’m half Mexican and also black) People think it’s funny to yell “go back over the border” when both my mom and I were born in Lima, and my dad was a U.S citizen. I’ve been called a wetback “as a joke” and my family doesn’t believe that it’s “that bad”. I just wish the people of Lima/my school were a little nicer. I’ve had better conversations with some nice random older ladies at the store than I’ve had at school.

&nbsp;

>I’m just tired of being around immature people. Maybe I sound immature writing this, I don’t know, but I digress. My goal in life is to make Lima better. I want to go to college to become an Urban Designer. I want to restore all the older buildings to their original form and bring in beautiful new buildings and some greenery. I want there to be something for people of every age. I want to attract people and really put Lima on the map. I know it’s forever away, but daydreaming about this kind of stuff keeps me sane. I’d like to here your opinion on what would make Lima a better place/what’d you like to see put in.

&nbsp;

>Also it’s hard to find a nice vegetarian restaurant around here. So if you have some suggestions about anything that I mentioned it’d really be helpful. Thanks to whoever read all that :)

"If you’re on Facebook, find the group Lima Area Runners and ask there. You’ll get a ton of feedback as it is a pretty active group. 

Personally, I do most of my miles on the river walk that runs east/west through town. Many times I’ll just run a couple miles to get to it, or I’ll park my car at Farout Park and just get on it there. You can find a map of the river walk on the Lima Parks website. 

All the reservoirs are nice to run around. Ottawa Metro and Heritage Parks are on each end of the river walk but bother individually have enough trails and loops to run if you just want to stay in one area. If you want some easy trails, most of the Johnny Appleseed parks have some good, easy trails to run. There are several people each weekend looking to run with someone.

"What makes an area desirable to live in are subjective but Lima consistently falls behind most in the state and nationally when compared with similar sized areas. The places that you mentioned are a start but still leaves the area well behind where it should be for its size. They are an improvement but the overall area remains stagnant from my viewpoint. My point about the economic situation of the area is a major contributor to the state of the area. If people are struggling to get by and don't have disposable income, the money isn't there to support a diverse restaurant and entertainment sector.

I'm not moving the goal posts by pointing out that they are not special or unique. A diverse and unique selection of places is what makes a place unique and exciting. Having a craft beer bar or wine bar does not make for an exciting place to live. The restaurant scene in the Lima is pretty bad to say the least. There are a handful of unique restaurants (most are the same old places) and a bunch of boring chain places. The music scene is no better unless you want to see country music or washed up acts trying to maintain some type of income. Most of people that I know in Lima are going to Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, or Detroit to see desirable live music acts.

Some of the parks in and around the city are nice but that is only one small ingredient in what makes an area nice to live in.

Investment in downtown by the hospital or college are great but it doesn't help when the majority leave after finishing. One of the top automotive schools are in the area but unfortunately most leave after graduating. The majority of the successful students leave for better opportunities. The population of the area is far behind on education when compared to the state and even further behind when compared nationally. A hospital alone can not save a city.

As far as Detroit goes, there is around there tens of billions currently being invested in the metro area. The city itself has more than 10+ billion being invested currently. I live 15 minutes out of the city proper where the suburbs have been well off for decades. The cities decline itself was due to people leaving for the suburbs that make up the metro area. The MSA of Detroit has a population of 4.3 million people and the CSA has 5.2 million. Outside of Chicago, the other cities mentioned are less than half the size.",t2_8prjc,mrmikehancho,0,1571512804.0,0,t1_f4bhxg6,f4bhxg6,False,LaDavison,t3_clzea0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lima/comments/clzea0/how_do_you_defend_lima/,How do you defend Lima?,/r/Lima/comments/clzea0/how_do_you_defend_lima/f4bhxg6/,0,r/Lima,0,0
"Your original post was that Lima was ""bad, stagnant, boring, and run down."" I just provided you with a bunch of examples that show, at the very least, that downtown Lima is not stagnant and that many if not most of the formerly rundown buildings in downtown are currently being renovated. ""Bad"" and ""boring"" are of course subjective but I certainly don't find Lima to be either of those things. My wife and I fill most of our weekends taking in live music, dining at some of the great restaurants we have here, biking and walking through our parks, golfing, watching college/high school level athletics, and going to shows/plays. Pretty much all of the same stuff I was doing when I lived in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, except it's not a pain in the ass to get to or an arm and a leg to pay for.

Your second post seems to be moving the goal posts to point out that Lima and the businesses moving to downtown Lima are not ""unique"" or ""special"" and that there is a lack of investment. There's of course a lot of space between ""not being unique"" or special"" and ""being bad, stagnant, boring, and run down."" Well I didn't take the position that the new restaurants, bars, coffee shops, media companies, retail stores, or housing were unique or special compared to other similarly sized downs. So I'm not sure what your point is there. Regarding investment, I just gave you examples of about $80 million within a half mile radius of the square. That's pretty significant for a town of this size.

Regarding your position that none of the mentioned items will help spur economic growth, a multi million dollar investment in a business incubator downtown was recently announced.  I'm also  of the opinion that adding two secondary education centers and a huge residency program in one of the industries expected to have the most economic growth over the short and long term will help spur economic growth.

"I am back in town multiple times per year and am aware of 90% of what you have listed. I also have a lot of family and friends back all around the Lima area who keep me updated on what is or isn't happening in the area. I have been to the new Mulligan's and it is not anything special. It was a couple of pool tables and a some tables in a big room. I have been told by multiple people that Teaser's does not have good food or service. Regardless, you are right that there are a few new places in town. These do not make up for years of decline and are things that a metro area of 100k people should have had long ago. The population continues to decline I'm the city and the surrounding area and I doubt that will stop any time soon.

Expanding the hospital or Rhodes adding another building is nice but it isn't going to do anything to grow the city. The building and apartments downtown follow a national trend that has been occuring some time of a migration back to city centers and downtown areas and is not something unique or special.

The city of Findlay, while have a smaller metro population, has surpassed Lima in city population and offers basically everything you listed and more. 

There is no new industry or opportunity in the area. If you want a low paying wage and minimal opportunity, then Lima is the place to be. Of course I am painting things with a broad strokes but it is because it is relatively true. The median household income for the entire Lima metro area is $10k less than the national average and the average resident only has an income of $24.5k. The number speak for themselves when you look at the area and the future outlook doesn't get any better. Without a significant investment or new industry coming to town, this trend will continue.

"Well...I was born in Lima in 1975 at Memorial Hospital. I went to Shawnee Maplewood and Shawnee Middle school, but moved away in 1988.  I remember going to the Mall, and The Ground Round and all the peanut shells on the ground.  I remember all the rich prick kids in Shawnee picking on me and my friends, everybody in everybody else’s business.  I remember Ronald Regan came thru on a train when I was a little kid.  I also vaguely remember people talking about Willie Nelson putting on a concert there.  And through all of it I remember seeing the light and smell from the refinery burning at night and lighting up the underside of the thick sheen of gray clouds that always seem to blanket the sky there.  For me it’s all just a bunch of memories now.  I’ve been back off and on over the years and I get what people are talking about...but I guess I just remember it fondly because it was my childhood.

"I guess I just disagree with your assessment of racial tensions in Lima, but I suppose that's anecdotal on both sides. From my perspective - I have coached youth sports in largely minority school districts in Dayton, Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland, and my experience has been the complete opposite of what you're suggesting. While Lima could certainly be better in terms of inclusion, diversity, etc., in the other above mentioned cities I've found that individuals living in poor areas are significantly more segregated and have less access to the larger community.

Regarding ""making it big and then never acknowledging Lima's existence,"" I just don't have any idea what you're talking about. Is your one example Phyllis Diller? She was in Lima touring the city just a few years before she passed away ([https://www.limaohio.com/news/425685/phyllis-dillers-legacy-remembered-in-lima](https://www.limaohio.com/news/425685/phyllis-dillers-legacy-remembered-in-lima)). What other example do you have of this claim?

Regarding parks, running/biking paths, music scene, arts scene, etc. - I didn't say that these things are on par with Central Park or that the Rally was Woodstock, but rather that Lima offers all of these amenities and events (often free), which, in my opinion, are on par or better than many of the surrounding communities offer.

That your original comment has been upvoted indicates that some people agree with you. But the question posed here was ""How do you defend Lima?""

"> The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 8th bullet points in that list don't have anything to do with the current state of Lima or living here.

Lenny Bruce (who spent the majority of his time in the largest city in the U.S.) thought Lima was a bunch of country people? Color me shocked. There were a bunch of very outwardly racist people here prior to the civil rights movement? There are parts of Lima with high crime?

C'mon, man - most of these are things that could be dressed up differently and said about 99% of the country.

Oy vey. Lima has a past which explains the present. There is a reason why racial tensions still simmer under the surface in Lima more so than some other communities north of the Mason-Dixon line. The fact that people choose to leave this place once they make it big and never even acknowledge it's existence afterwards is telling. 

Cleveland is number #4 on the list of dangerous places, Cincinnati is #7. 

> Lima, like every city, has plenty of flaws, many of which you named above. But it also has a beautiful park system,

Lima's park system is not all that. The new Hermon Woodland's park is nice. The rest are pretty pathetic.

> great bike paths and running trails, 

They're meh at best.

> a TON of community-wide music events (not many small communities have something like Rally in the Alley every Friday night in the summer and followed by the Concert in the Park series every Sunday night),

Ain't no one getting excited about Rally in the Square. Plenty of smallish communities have similar musical events. There's nothing unique to Lima about our music scene. Maybe back when we had a thriving punk scene, but that's been ages ago now.

> a great local sports scene,

Yeah, high school sports. Just like every other town in Ohio.

> a bunch of local musicians, comedians, artists, 

Yes, Lima is known for it's comedians. Come on dude.

> etc. that put on great acts at various local establishments on a weekly basis, and a lot of local entrepreneurs and organizations (from The Met, to Art Space Lima, to Legacy Arts, to Downtown Lima, Inc., etc.) that are committed to making downtown Lima a welcoming and enjoyable place to live. 

I mentioned the Met. Art Space Lima is mostly the same bunch of stuck up snobs who pride themselves on being big fish in a small pond.

> Lima is small enough to where anyone can make a meaningful impact if they're willing to put themselves out there and do the work, but also big enough to provide many of the resources typically found only in larger cities.

I suppose that's true enough.

Well I'd say those people who've never lived anywhere else have got it right.

"I critique Lima. There's not much good to say about it. 

* It was the home of one of the most violent wings of the KKK (the Black Legion). Blacks were banned from swimming or using the drinking fountains as Schoonover Park, and a separate bathroom was built for blacks at the old Kewpee. And because of this history, plenty of tension between race is still present in Lima today.

* Its greatest claim to fame is probably that Dillinger shot the sheriff here (that and the speakeasy had Lima acquiring the nickname ""Little Chicago""). 

* Most of our industry moved out by the 70s and 80s, and it was so bad that PBS created a documentary about it called Lost In Middle America. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210822/
 
* We're currently the 5th most dangerous place to live in Ohio. https://www.roadsnacks.net/most-dangerous-cities-in-ohio/

* There are higher levels of cancer in and around the refinery than there is in surrounding communities according to a relatively recent article on Lima in Rolling Stone magazine. https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/where-the-tea-party-rules-69923/
 
* Phyllis Diller is from here, but, as far as I know, she never came back for a visit. 
 
* Glee named its imaginary town after Lima, a town that was brighter and perhaps more interesting than the one that exists. 
 
* The notorious comedian Lenny Bruce (played by Dustin Hoffman in the biopic ""Lenny"") passed through Lima and had a couple comedy routines about what a back-country bunch of hicks everyone here was. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WighLoWdgvA

* The city tore down most of it's beautiful old architecture, and the architecture left standing is now being converted into low income housing. 

* We're lucky to have two Thai restaurants a struggling Greek restaurant and some Mexican and Chinese places, but generally speaking food culture isn't that big here unless all you care about is pizza and burgers.

* UNOH probably helps keep business running on Cable and Elida, but you have to put up with kids driving around like maniacs in souped up rust buckets, and lifted trucks with plastic ball sacks on the back that roll coal at traffic lights.

Defenses for Lima? 

* We've got Kewpees. 

* Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken started in Lima, so there's that.

* The Met, Vino Bellissimo, Old City Prime and a few other places are doing their best to try to elevate food and drink culture in Lima.

* If you like looking at old ruined buildings, and you don't mind risking getting caught by the cops, or getting tetanus, there's an old graffiti covered tuberculosis hospital behind Clayton and Western Ohio Ave. 

* Property is relatively affordable.

* People are generally friendly. 

* Groamy's is a nice throwback to when record stores ruled (specifically Mind Dust Music in Elida).

Multi-Vehicle Crash Shuts Down I-75 near Lima
DIESEL SPILL KEEPS INTERSTATE CLOSED FOR HOURS

Lima – On November 27, near 11:41 a.m., troopers from the Lima Post of the Ohio State Highway Patrol were dispatched to a multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 75 near mile post 127 in Allen County.  When troopers arrived on scene, the northbound lanes of Interstate 75 were completely blocked by a commercial semi which had jack knifed, along with two other crashed vehicles.

A 2006 Dodge pickup, driven by Albert Morales, 43, of Columbus Grove, was northbound on Interstate 75 when he lost control, struck a guardrail, and ricocheted back into traffic where he struck a 2017 Freightliner semi, driven by Russell Hardesty, 75, of Wapakoneta.  The Freightliner jackknifed and pushed the Dodge pickup into a 2007 Ford Crown Victoria, owned by John Chapman, of Hamilton, Ohio.

Mr. Morales was transported to Mercy Health St. Rita’s Medical Center for non-life threatening injuries.  Mr. Chapman and Mr. Hardesty were treated on scene for minor injuries.  All occupants wear wearing properly adjusted safety belts.

A significant amount of diesel fuel was spilled during the crash.  EPA officials were called to the scene to oversee cleanup efforts, delaying the opening of the interstate for several hours.

There were additional crashes reported as a result of the lengthy traffic backup.  Interstate 75 has since reopened and normal traffic flow has resumed.  Mr. Morales was cited for failure to control.

The Lima Post was assisted on scene by Bath Township Fire and EMS, Allen County EMA, Allen County Sheriff’s Office, Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), Beaverdam Fleet, Kinstle’s Towing and Big Daddy’s Towing services.

The crash remains under investigation.
