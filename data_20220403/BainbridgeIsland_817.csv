"DM me, my parent has been here since the late 90s the only ppl buying on Bainbridge are buying because they have to. While I don’t think it’s going to pop I think a dramatic downturn will happen. First, Amazon goes back in offices in 2022. It’s a HELL of a commute. I’ve done it. I’d tell you it was doable a couple days a week for sure. It is not. It’s not so much the commute it’s the ferry delays now, the missing of one boat causing you to be home hours late, no 24 hour urgent care. If my kids weren’t already integrated in the school system we’d never buy but we may be forced to just eat $200k paying top dollar over-inflated prices. 

If I could move anywhere? I’d pick waterfront in port orchard. Schools are meh. Do you fly regularly? We do. Flying from Bainbridge sucks. Getting to the airport from Port Orchard? Drive or ferry. And neither take hours. 

All that being said, I love Bainbridge. Been coming “home” here for almost 25 years. Schools are great and it’s nice and safe. That’s why it’s so much more expensive. 

I think if you bought waterfront here it would be a great investment (well, idk if I’d advice waterfront due to climate change). AND I think somewhere like Port Orchard will ultimately be as much or be more desirable in 10-20 years.

"I’m new here and in my 20s so what I’m gonna say is based on my limited experience and talking to locals. I like Bainbridge and Kitsap county as a whole cuz it’s beautiful and it’s a slower pace than regular city life near Seattle and Tacoma. Bainbridge is an expensive place to live. I see this as a place for older people and their kids for growing up. I don’t have concrete evidence but I imagine many of the teenagers/young adults here think there’s “nothing to do” and want to move closer to the city. The parks are really nice. Many of them overlook a bay/the Puget Sound. It probably has similar weather to you in Scotland, especially during the winter. I grew up in a large suburb of Los Ángeles and felt there was “nothing to do” even though there was tons so make sure you’re looking for what exactly you want to do. My priority was to be living in a beautiful green place that offers tons of hiking nearby but be within an hour drive from a large city. Yes we have the ferry that takes us to Seattle but unless you’re really active about going there all the time it doesn’t feel as close as you think. If you grew up in a really small town then bainbridge will feel large and have a bunch to do. American high schools vary so much depending on where you went to school and what type of personality you have. I went to a largish high school but was shy so I didn’t do much adventuring.

"Lol all g, I was at lytal beach, eagle harbor, and William olsen park the last 3 days... Each have different pros and cons.

Lytal: sandy flat beach which you can walk pretty far out into, downsides are it's unprotected so you get wakes from the ferries. It also has a pretty strong current which makes it cold... Like classic Puget Sound c o l d. It also has alotta box jellies which are b I g... 6/10

Eagle Harbor: I row in the mornings from 7-9, the waters calm but it's eagle harbor, rreeaallyy freakin dirty. The beach we launch from is Always sharp and muddy. 3/10

William Olsen Park: I actually just got back from paddleboarding with the varsity boys team... High tides like lytal but low tides like eagle harbor beach wise... The water tho.... Ooooo MAN it's WARM. Ya you heard me, the Sound is warm there... Shocked me aswell xP
Only downsides is the lowrider beach, but also there's seaweed around, aswell as crabs fish and seals... We saw one today while I was swimming and got a lil nervous... But then again we saw a box jelly pretty deep and was like frick this crap I'm out!

"This is terrifying. No lie. This is horrific. I thought the church was supposed to be some kinda resource for mental health; for guidance and counseling. Granted, I'ven't been to mass in over 2 decades, idk what it's like anymore - but I thought the church was there for people who are struggling and looking for a path, even if that path includes a *healthy* adherence to religion; to better someone's life.

To deny psychology, and to deny the idea people need access to mental health therapy/counseling makes me absolutely ill in my heart. I'm getting the vibe that this ""Pastor Grant"" is someone who would willingly, gleefully, rid of services like Helpline House (where I'm getting counseling mind you), so that more people can get brainwashed to his interpretation of ""God""...if they held that power.

As an avid cyclist, Classic Cycle has always struck me as one of those shops that embodies a lot of what's bad about the cycling community: pompous, unwelcoming, unwilling to change, arrogant, etc.  For example this little nugget taken from their [website](http://classiccycleus.com/home/rentals/service-request/):

> The Canyon brand seems to think that the world doesn’t need bike shops. They’re pretty obnoxious about it, actually. We might suggest that you send your Canyon back to the factory in Germany to be repaired, no offense.
> 
> Some electric bikes have wheel sizes, general heft and custom parts that aren’t found elsewhere in the bicycle world (Radpower has a couple of bikes like this), so if we can’t lift the bike or fit the wheel into a truing stand, we won’t be working on it.

or this

> While we do work on bikes purchased elsewhere, and will build bikes or install parts that you purchase over the internet, please show us some courtesy.  Bringing in your own replacement parts for us to use during the course of a tune up is tacky.  Shopping for parts at our store, buying them online, and then bringing them in for us to install is really insulting.

I've heard countless stories from friends regarding their negative experiences, I've had negative experiences with them myself.

"I've intentionally sidestepped the drama in my other posts. It's Bainbridge Island. There's always drama. :-)

Prior to the reopening, there were folks up-in-arms about not reopening, and now there are folks up-in-arms about the district reopening. You can go find it on the various Facebook groups out there.

I basically sat in the presentations about the reopening and went (in my mind): ""Ok, you guys (district) have taken in a lot of data, analyzed it, and made a reasonable decision based on it, and there's no data that I know of that refutes this, so I'm going with your decision here.""

"Answering your question about Odyssey first: Both of my kids are in Odyssey (4th and 6th grades). It's not for everyone, but they love it and thrive in it. It's a highly parent-involved program: you're expected to volunteer 10 hours/month, and there's a school-wide parent-teacher meeting every month (starts with all-school, then we break out into classroom ""clusters""). In a normal year, the school year kicks off with a two-day camp at Fort Flagler (again, at least one parent is expected to attend). Everyone is on a first-name basis at Odyssey -- students address their teachers and the principal by their first names, not ""Mr Lastname"" or ""Ms Lastname"".

Standardized test scores at Odyssey seem to be a bit lower than other schools, but if you care about standardized test scores, Odyssey is not going to be a good fit in the first place. Placement is by lottery.

Here's what my son's (4th grade Odyssey) schedule looks like:  
Mon and Wed:  
7:50-8:10: Spelling and grammar  
8:10-8:40: Math review; goal work/finish work  
8:40-9:20: Art/Specialist  
9:20-10:30: Finish math review goal work (if needed), or  
9:35-10:35: Read aloud and Workbook  

Tue and Thu:  
7:50-8:10: Spelling and Grammar  
8:10-9:00: Math review; goal work/finish work  
9:00-10:00: Read aloud and Workbook  
10:00-10:30: Social Studies  
10:30-10:35: Discuss PM workplan  

Friday:  
7:50-8:05: Community meeting (school-wide)  
8:05-8:25: Class meeting  
8:25-9:25: Meeting time for students who need support  
(Still have Reading Buddies and other group meetings on Fridays)

The suggest schedule for the afternoon (at home) is:  
10:35-12:00: Transport home; lunch; recess  
12:00-1:00: MyMath  
1:00-1:15: Recess  
1:15-2:00: Writing lesson

"elementary teacher in the district, I can answer these!

&#x200B;

In hybrid (for k-4) students do still receive in person specialist instruction during their half day, but not every day. My school has students seeing specialist 2x a week. 

&#x200B;

The expectation is that they spend half of the day doing in person instruction and the other half doing asynchronous learning through assignments posted online or paper tasks sent home - so homework more or less, but without it the kids aren't getting their full instructional minutes each day. Some teachers are doing instructional videos, others sending home menus of options for the time at home, etc. It differs from class to class and school to school, but since teachers are teaching in person all day, students must access these asynchronous materials during the part of the day they are not at school, no access to Zoom. 2.5 hours a day is not enough time to cover everything, and the state department of education has made no concessions regarding standards to be covered this year or breadth of curriculum to teach - we are expected to still cover a normal school year's worth of material. As an example, in my class, we do our core reading/writing/math instruction, and then students do independent practice for the math we start in person at home, and get to choose literacy tasks from a list to complete on their own (reading for 15 minutes, practicing sight words, practicing handwriting, etc.)

&#x200B;

Fridays are asynchronous for the most part but most teachers are doing a short meeting on Zoom to get all the kids together since they're split into cohorts and don't get to interact with their whole class during the rest of the school week. The rest of the day would be accessing online learning materials. Fridays are currently always in this model. The hybrid schedule is consistent week to week, no changes in what days students attend or how the schedule works.

&#x200B;

Odyssey is an opt-in program within the district, I believe on a lottery-based system. Multi-age learning has a lot of benefits, academically and socially. It is not a school your child is going to be assigned to like a neighborhood elementary school.

"Thanks a bunch for your reply, very helpful.  If you can answer some follow up questions

With the Hybrid model.  In the 2.5 hours do they get the core learning done, such as English, math, science and forgo the PE, art, and music classes?  Do they go home with homework to finish up the day?  Do they go home and finish up the day with digital learning (highly doubt that would be the case)? 

|Fridays are “asynchronous” days at home
Can you expand on this.  Does this mean every other week they do a full day face to face or is it a full day digital?

|There’s also a multiage program (Odyssey) that goes from K-8, and the classes above kindergarten are grouped into two grades each
Is this an ""non-standard"" school you can elect to send your kids to.  Trying to understand reasoning for grouping two grades together (not saying its bad or good just trying to understand).

"We just restarted hybrid learning up through 8th grade. There’s an all on-line option for families who prefer not to send their kids in.

Hybrid is currently Monday through Thursday for 2.5 hours, either AM or PM. There’s a break between the groups so the classrooms can be cleaned, and windows are required to be open for air circulation. Fridays are “asynchronous” days at home, and the schools get a deep cleaning. Masks are required at school, and for now parent volunteers are not allowed.

The high schools (Bainbridge, Eagle Harbor) will be reopening later this month per the plan.

Note that elementary school is K-4 here. We have an intermediate school (Sakai) for 5-6, and a middle school (Woodward) for 7-8.

"Short answer: no.

Long answer: Technically KPUD has fiber run around various parts of the island. But a few years back Comcast got the state to make it so municipalities cannot act as ISPs, so that killed the dream of municipal broadband. You can still get service through a commercial ISP, *if* you are close enough to the fiber and you are willing to pay to have it trenched over to your house. They've had a survey up for literally years to gauge the interest of people in getting fiber, and the answer is an overwhelming *YES*, but to my knowledge no neighborhood area has hit whatever benchmark they've set for actually, you know, getting around to actually supplying it. There are some serious tech types who've done it, usually because they need to run a server from home, but it's stupid expensive. Kavu networks offers it to businesses in the Coppertop Park.

"My family moved to the island from the Bryant/Ravenna area 2+ years ago due to the city/urbanization of the neighborhoods. Traffic, property crime, etc., were all getting to us. We don't regret the decision one bit.

Pros: ""small town"" living, but near a big city; lower priced (but not low-priced) housing, compared to most popular Seattle neighborhoods; really, really great emergency services (police + fire); schools; easy to schedule most things (doctor visits to Virginia Mason, dentists, most common other needs).

Cons: very white, BUT very accepting/welcoming of POC (but, this is coming from me, a white male, so I can only infer from what I see anecdotally); for ""real"" shopping (Costco, clothes), you're driving around to Silverdale.

For our lifestyle, the pros heavily, heavily outweigh the cons.

Tip: if you think you'll be taking the ferry often (as a commuter, etc.), buy or rent housing somewhat near it.

">I am curious what the job market is like.

Yes, BI is pretty much a bedroom community.  Sure, there are some people that work for companies on the island, or work from home, but the vast majority of working islanders work in Seattle.  

If you are looking for a service job there are some decently busy restaurants on the island.  Just off the top of my head: hitchcock (& their deli), Marche, Brucciato, Pegasus, & Via Rosa.  Personally, if I was a young 20-something I'd be trying to get in with the Hitchcock group or over at Pegasus as they seem most ""hip"".  That being said, I have no idea what it's like to work for either of them.

Another option is commuting in to Seattle everyday to work at a restaurant there.  The monthly pass is about $106 BUT you get at minimum $15/hour over in Seattle.  

When you're ready to move to a more 9-5 job you will most likely have to target companies over in Seattle. 

>I am also curious how welcoming the town is to outsiders.

I've lived here for a little over 3 years no and haven't noticed any bias towards outsiders.  I'm friends with a lot of people that grew up here, but also with a lot of ""transplants"".  

While I'm not going to discourage you from living here by any means, I do hope you understand the realities of living on BI.  As someone else mentioned the island is mainly made up of A) Retirees , and B) People looking to start / raise a family.  I rarely run across BI residents in that 18-28 range.  I rode with a 25 year old that moved to the island last year from Chicago because he really ""liked the idea of it.""  He lasted about 7 months before he moved over to Seattle.  I'm really hoping that BI starts to skew younger in the near future, but right now we just aren't there.

Raves:

- Established businesses that cater to the community

Rants:
- Nature at your doorstep (spiders, huge spiders everywhere, and lots of deer and coyotes to run into at night, with very little road lighting)
- The ferry will control your life, especially if you go the no-car route (good luck going to any events that run late in Seattle)

- At one point, the vaccination rate of children on the island was the lowest in the western half of Washington. Not sure if this is still the case, but there’s a good enough chunk of nutters on the island that Town and Country has a huge homeopathy section. No joke.

I’ll be frank. I had my ups and downs with the place. I still visit occasionally. I’ve made good friends there, and there’s a fantastic, albeit small art scene.

"Going to college was really great for me. By the end of senior year I was ready to meet some new people! (More on this later) I go to WSU, so fairly far away but still in state. Pullman is similar to bainbridge because they share a small town vibe. Teach your kids how to exist in a city though - bainbridge won't do that.

I would recommend getting your kids involved with Boy Scouts (if they're boys). I'm not familiar with the state of Girl Scouts on the island, but the coolest things I did outdoors were through scouts. Bainbridge is located in such a way that we have excellent access to the Olympic National Park as well as fairly easy access to stuff in the Cascades. So I got to experience a lot of the great hiking that's close by. My troop was great. Pretty much all of the adult leaders are experienced, knowledgeable backpackers, as well as being smart, capable role models for your kids. 

Another cool (or terrible) thing about growing up on the island is that you stick with roughly the same people through your entire time in school. I was lucky to find a large but close knit friend group in high school made up of people who I had just met and also who I had been in school with since kindergarten. This probably makes it harder to say goodbye to people when you leave for college, but it also has given me a large group of people to hang out with in the summer.

"I've been playing disc golf for years and would love to have a course on the island. Most of the opposition, expressed both in the letter and on Facebook, is absurd. But, then again, most people don't know a thing about the game. And NIMBYism. 

There are essentially two types of courses: 1) wilderness/confined, and 2) public/open. The Battle Point proposal is obviously the latter. Most disc golfers prefer to play the former. Additionally, most confined courses are for adults only because they are challenging. Courses in public settings are better suited for all ages and abilities.

There are a handful of good confined courses in Kitsap, the closest being at Fredericksen Park in Poulsbo. I love that course, but I'm not of fan of driving to PBO to play. I'd play more often if we had one on the island, and I'd teach my kids sooner. That's where I'm coming from and I know I'm not alone. 

Arguments against the Battle Point course include: traffic, parking, grass damage, tree damage, visual blight, and, of course, beheadings...

This will not be a destination course. Very few people will drive past Fredericksen and go over the bridge to play at a public park. Certainly no Seattle area golfer will ride the ferry for it. 

I will admit that many confined courses such as Fredericksen are ecologically trashed, albeit in a fairly limited way, with erosion and garbage. Fortunately that's not a concern here, but as for grass getting worn out or tree trunks getting dinged, I doubt Battle Point would get played often enough. The ducks will be fine, too.

The tee pads and baskets would be inconspicuous, in my opinion, and would blend in with all the other recreational stuff already in place. Disc golf courses are not sprawling.

As for resident trolls looking to get hit by a disc so they can sue, it won't likely happen. I've played at very active public and open courses much more poorly designed than the proposed Battle Point course and it's just not going to happen. It's not like that many people use Battle Point, either. It's difficult enough to hit the basket; it's more difficult to hit a person. 

I hope to provide these comments and more at a future public meeting, and perhaps to Parks board members and staff. But really, it's a stupid ""fight"" and doesn't exactly endear me to Bainbridge.

"I'm pretty indifferent, but for any valid point the author raises they really discount their argument with the sensationalism and afterthought handwritten section. 

Some of the sillier points:

- ""there is already a disc golf course 45-minute drive away that they can use"" [45 minutes isn't terrible convenient IMO.  There's also a bowling alley 45 minutes away – doesn't mean we can't/shouldn't have one here] 

- ""speeds of more than 70MPH"" [I highly doubt that ordinary everyday players are hurling discs at 70MPH.  This [Disc Site](https://www.bestdiscgolfdiscs.com/using-science-to-increase-your-drive-distance/) has average drive distance by speed.  I'm thinking 70 might be over sensationalizing the whole thing]

- ""Do you want the ducks and geese to be frightened away and the trees and grounds to be destroyed by disc golfers?""  [I'm going to need a source for all of that.  Seems like someone is making assumptions.] 

- The whole ""Google"" bit is a little much.  Woman disfigured in park lost vision in one eye from being struck by a disc. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there are baseball fields, tennis courts, & a roller hockey rink at battle point park - I think a projectile from any of those given the right circumstances could do the same damage.  That Google search is so pointed and the sources so, excuse me, *fake*, that it's hard to take any of this seriously.

Personally, I don't have strong feelings about its aesthetics. The block of multi-family along Wyatt is jarring, though. Perhaps if the north side of Wyatt eventually gains height, then it'll be appropriate. A related design problem is south-end traffic using Wyatt. 

There's plenty more to be said about the community itself, and those opinions may also taint perceptions, but I think most islanders are reacting to how it looks and feels when driving by.

"Since OP mentioned gardening, let me expand on this a bit:

> Permitting is difficult for this reason, if you are considering building.

There are laws about how many / what size trees you can cut (there's a 'significant' tree designation, measured 4' off the ground, that's anywhere from 6-10"" depending on type of tree and neighborhood). You get to cut up to 6 insignificant trees per year. 

There are protected regions - especially the shoreline - where doing ANYTHING is getting increasingly difficult. The way the shoreline master plan is written right now, you can't even do routine trimming of deciduous trees within 200' of the coast; don't even think about cutting down a tree, building a new structure or installing a bulkhead.

I'd like to add a couple of things as a rather new-ish Islander (moved to the island just over a year ago because... baby.  of course)

Patience is critical with the ferry commute, especially in the summer months.  During busy seasons it can run late pretty consistently (30 - 45 min is not unusual on evening commutes).

There are a good amount of deer in my neighborhood, & everyone that does garden has raised-beds with high fencing around them. 

If you travel out of SeaTac a lot get ready for the ""2nd leg.""  You can't just hop in your car / cab from the airport and be home.  Seems obvious, but it's a consideration.

More food options are starting to pop up on the island, but it's still pretty limited (take out chinese food should be open soon.  HOORAY!).  Be comfortable with cooking / eating most of your meals at home.

"hear! hear! Thanks, /u/wiscowonder.

The FB group does occasionally tackles interesting and relevant topics. Without getting too meta or dwelling on certain characters, I think this sub should experiment with being a mirror of sorts. For example, the Kitsap Sun story on proposed development at Wyatt/Madison drew a fair number of reactions and (mostly) ugly comments. I'm curious what we'd say. (I'll post it to start...) I reckon there are plenty of other things to discuss that the FB set misses, so again, thanks for the work, mods.
