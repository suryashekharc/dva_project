Previous Post: $1950/month x 6 months = **$11,700**

Current Post: $2300/month x 5 months (August Free) = **$11,500**

$11,700 - $11,500 = **$200**

$200/$11,700 ≈ 0.01709 ≈ **1.7%**

So based off your previous post OP, this new rent is **$200 cheaper** over the time period of 6 months.

"I’m hoping this gets some traction, specifically about the shell fishing because I’ve been thinking about it as well.

And I have seen folks actively collecting (I believe clams?) down in the Cummings Park Beach area. Granted I wouldn’t rely on other people’s actions when my own safety is in the mix haha but that paired with the apparent water testing leaves me more optimistic.

"Had family/friends living in all of the mentioned spots, here is there and my take.

Stamford Urby: weirdly reminds me of a black mirror episode - pretty weird location next to a highway and ancient mall. Apartment layouts are absolutely bizarre and force inconvenient minimalism.

Parc Grove- (currently live) - awful since this new management took over, nicely located though and huge apartments for cheaper than normal

Postmark- Not the best bang for your buck in harbor point, amenity fees here were 30% more than NV and Beacon in Harbor point (and sentiment about Postmark having a lot of kids is true). Apartments are beautiful though.

NV- Very interesting layout, if you value community rooms and amenities NV is really cool. The apartments are a bit weird though, but you can get a bit more space here than other harbor point options.

111- hear a lot of mixed things here, heard management is not great and not as professional. Half of this building is on a not so great part of town. A stretch where my SO and I have to avoid when walking back from the train due to cat calling and confrontation. 

Beacon- Surprisingly affordable options for being right on the water (likely moving there in August).

"Lived in 121 Towne, basically the same apartment building as 111, same owners, etc. 

Everything was fine except management being a complete pita in my experience.I was a bit singled out so I don't know how good my testimony would be. Person under me would complain about my dog barking whenever he heard a single dog bark, so they would come and knock on my door at 2AM waking me and my dogs up, then tell me that my dogs are barking because theres a strange person angrily hitting my door. When I moved out before I sublet it, I got 2 more noise complaints that week from them for my dog barking. There was literally nothing in the apartment and they called multiple times about my dog - 30 miles away - was being loud. It wasn't until I showed them that the apartment was completely empty that they stopped calling.

Obviously, they illegally kept my security deposit despite the inspection paper being perfect, and then would hang up when I called.

there was usually an open grille at any time and the pool doesn't get that crowded (my apartment overlooked them).

"+1 Stay away from Honda of Greenwich.

When we were in the market for a sedan, we thought of the Accord and when we went over to check it out we noticed they treated their sales people like absolute garbage (yelling and cursing) and that made our sales person -extremely- pushy to make a sale while low balling our trade-in by $4k and insulting pretty much every other brand we were considering (just insulting, not a pro/con).

We eventually picked a Kia Optima (from Stamford Kia), which was $5k below MSRP just by asking (tech package and brought all the way from Cape Cod because we wanted a specific color, $32k MSRP, sold for $27k) but I do have to say you should get financing from outside as they will try to fleece you with the APR.",t2_3xeun,nekoeth0,0,1647104023.0,0,t1_i0dwy7q,i0dwy7q,False,Grapeflavor_,t3_tc4yt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StamfordCT/comments/tc4yt7/dealership_recommendation/,Dealership recommendation?,/r/StamfordCT/comments/tc4yt7/dealership_recommendation/i0dwy7q/,2,r/StamfordCT,0,2

"I checked in with most of the local dealers of those brands except Kia (did check in on Hyundai) back in December / January. All that I contacted wanted $3K over MSRP for crossovers or small SUVs.

Wasn't happy about the price but they were at least friendly and easy to deal with.

ETA saw you wanted a GP as well. Highly recommend Dr. Anne Williams, she’s in the Tully center.

"Yup; [JA academy](http://www.jaelitesoccer.com/) has indoor games. The website is just ok, I called up and asked and they found me a spot on a week night men's league team.

[Chelsea piers](https://www.chelseapiersct.com/soccer/adult-leagues/) also has games, both league and pick up though I haven't been to pick up in years. Generally more expensive.

[This meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Stamford-CT-Pick-up-Soccer-Meetup-Group/events/284135853) group was active during the summer despite not looking like it on the site, might be worth reaching out to the owner and seeing if they are still playing.

In Norwalk, the [SONO Field](https://www.sonofieldhouse.com/) house had men's league as well.  
EDIT [Here is a meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Stamford-Indoor-Soccer/) that plays here.

[This meetup gam](https://www.meetup.com/White-Plains-Co-Ed-Soccer/events/284293305)e in White plains is solid too. You can sign up and pay only when you want to go. It does fill up quick though.

There is also the [Amateur Soccer league of Connecticut](https://ctsal.leaguerepublic.com/index.html) that used to play full 11 v 11 mostly at Cove.

"So honest opinion, no one comes to Stamford for fun, you get people for work. If you can get a condo near some offices you'll probably do ok but expect business travelers only, and you're competing with big and kind of cheap hotels, and limited to 3-4 nights a week on average tops. I think the math for an Airbnb investment is questionable here. (250k for a 1br anyone would actually pick over a hotel room if the company is paying for it anyway, and maybe you can get 600-700 a week from the limited nights, one week is going to taxes every month, 3 weeks are going to mortgage, another week is going to expenses, maybe more, and most months only have 4 weeks). Also a large chunk of buildings ban short term rentals or charge fees for it. (Heard of a place foreclosing on someone for short term renting and couldn't find the owner easily, it was a thing, 500 $ fine per violation).

In my experience, Airbnb rentals do best in places where people go for fun, and ain't no one coming to Stamford to see the sights.",t2_4dfo8zxc,knightofsolarisbos,0,1644744125.0,0,t1_hwrcgjp,hwrcgjp,True,MightyPizza25,t3_sr8909,https://www.reddit.com/r/StamfordCT/comments/sr8909/airbnb_in_stamford/,AirBnb in Stamford,/r/StamfordCT/comments/sr8909/airbnb_in_stamford/hwrcgjp/,7,r/StamfordCT,0,7

"1. If the server is considered eligible for tips, their base pay plummets to a little over $6/hr for restaurant workers. The difference between that and min wage has to be made up by either tips or their employer, but only up to min wage.

2. Some restaurants do actually funnel some amount of tips to other staff, called “tipping out”.

3. If the person you’re picking up the food is also the one that cooked/prepared, they are in fact receiving that tip (many fast/casual joints).

4. Even if the tip is just going to the server, they did spend time getting your order ready, handing it off to you curbside, etc. that takes away from tipping customers inside, so tipping them is fair to do.

"I actually grew up in PA and moved to Stamford/Norwalk a few years ago.  The restaurant scene is pretty different, it was actually one of the most striking things about moving to this area.  Chain restaurants (Chilis, Applebees, etc) exist, but they are far less common.  However,  there's way more locally owned/smaller local chain restaurants (such as Barcelona).

The overall bar/restaurant scene is pretty great in both Stamford and surrounding areas, it's a very high cost of living area so a lot of people with cash to burn eating out.  1 bedroom apartments are probably going to be in the $1,700 - $2,200/month range.  A lot of younger people (in their 20s/early 30s) tend to gravitate towards Stamford because of the bar/restaurant/stuff to do.
