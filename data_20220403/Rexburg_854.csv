"We all grapple with things, my friend. They're not asking you to not feel attracted, they're simply asking you not to act on it. This isn't any different than Heterosexual couples, really. (Indeed, authorities delineate between same-sex attraction and homosexual behavior)  


 However, you're now at an impasse, aren't you? You either fall in line with the Gospel and feel as though you're rejecting yourself, or you continue to live the way you are and feel isolated on campus.  


As such, there are two options, really; whichever you choose is ultimately up to you, and what \*you\* would consider best for yourself.  


1. You conform to church culture, and integrate into the community out here  

2. You save up, and move away, perhaps transferring to a non-LDS campus where you can integrate easier.",t2_clywm124,Rex_Sacrorum,0,1632508172.0,0,t1_he4eayt,he4eayt,False,[deleted],t3_pny8sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rexburg/comments/pny8sp/looking_for_people_who_dont_fit_the_mold_here_in/,Looking for people who don’t fit the mold here in rexburg.,/r/rexburg/comments/pny8sp/looking_for_people_who_dont_fit_the_mold_here_in/he4eayt/,1,r/rexburg,0,1
"It wasn’t like this at all 3 years ago. I ran away to BYU Idaho to escape my family because I thought it was safe. Tuition was cheap and I thought this a perfect opportunity to make something more of myself, this included being more faithful and resilient. But as I continued to attend I slowly realized that I didn’t have a place here. I went to counseling and the answer I received was to be celibate and shortly after they tried conversion therapy. In the end I recently gave up hope, if I can’t make it to the highest kingdom what’s the point. I can’t afford another college and there is no other family that will take me in. I wish I was straight, I wished to have a future family, I wished to be just like all of you, but every time I try I fail. I feel like I can’t do what is required which is to never love someone I feel attracted to. I could go on but what’s the point, you people don’t really care, only on condition that live the gospel is when I’m welcomed with open arms, to hell if I’m not.

"If you are patient and caring check out HAS Inc. I work there. It's an assisted living company for adults with developmental disabilities. Starts at $11/hour with opportunities for raises, so pretty good for Rexburg, still meh for everywhere else. However, there are always opportunities for overtime if you want it, so if you don't mind extra shifts paychecks can get pretty big.

You get to meet lots of fun people, and get paid to take clients to activities like the zoo. Yesterday I was paid to go to Lagoon!

It can be pretty difficult because of the demographic of people we work with, but if you've got the patience to work with them it is very fulfilling.

"Idaho is full of idiots, and openly racist people. My roommate is proud to be racist towards asians and let's us know everyday.

Common sense and decency isn't common in Idaho. Was watching the final episode of the Bachelor earlier this week and the entire apartment was racist remarks, not understanding or listening to any of what was being said, and overall just going in with prejudice and not even attempting to keep their minds open or consider where people are coming from.

Most of Idaho doesn't know what it's like to be discriminated against because of skin color, what it's like to be told ""shut up, you're brown"", ""your opinion doesn't matter"", ""go back to where you came from"", and grew up in a bubble of people with the same experiences who are overall just very close-minded and hateful towards their neighbors.

Overall, don't worry about it. We're all here on this earth together, we're all people. If these people want to hold hate and be racist, I feel sorry for them because they're living a life of hatred, and feel as though they haven't really figured out why they're here or what they want to live for. We're all here together, spread love, love will find you back, even if that means that some hate does as well.",t2_10xn06,huntingboi89,0,1616210713.0,0,t1_grk0rda,grk0rda,True,[deleted],t3_m8ec26,https://www.reddit.com/r/rexburg/comments/m8ec26/brown_in_rexburg/,Brown in Rexburg,/r/rexburg/comments/m8ec26/brown_in_rexburg/grk0rda/,1,r/rexburg,0,1

Smoking and drinking is so heavily regulated, and it's a choice where COVID isn't.  Plus, so far this year, we've had almost 1.5 MILLION deaths worldwide.  The flu is pretty bad, but even bad years show about 690,000 deaths worldwide, [according to WHO.](https://www.health.com/condition/cold-flu-sinus/how-many-people-die-of-the-flu-every-year)  This very well could be what we have to expect annually if we don't do something about the virus.

I'll concede that my arguments are moot if we can get a vaccine out there that's potent.  We do have the government to thank for the future vaccine being free to the public (or should we be cursing them for denying a business their right to make profit from a product?) There's also the anti-vax movement to worry about, and a resurgence with a mutated version could hit us *again.*

I will agree that the whole essential business thing is pretty BS.  I'm an employee at an essential business, but apparently not essential enough for the HEROES Act.  I do also believe that this comes with a caveat, that social distancing is enforced as well.  On an individual level, I feel mask mandates should be enforced.  Just like the laws governing alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and seatbelts.  And don't start with me on China.  I half believe the Chinese government fabricated and released this virus in hopes to put a stop to the protesting happening in Hong Kong.",t2_5xi5j,shuboni,0,1606453154.0,0,t1_gdqjrwh,gdqjrwh,False,shuboni,t3_jxn8b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rexburg/comments/jxn8b1/sometimes_im_ashamed_to_say_i_live_here/,Sometimes I'm ashamed to say I live here,/r/rexburg/comments/jxn8b1/sometimes_im_ashamed_to_say_i_live_here/gdqjrwh/,2,r/rexburg,0,2

"You've never had the flu? Ever? I'll call BS on that. If true, doesn't change the fact that the flu is far deadlier for younger demographics. It kills a consistent several thousand a year in US alone. So why no masks and talk of quarantine with it? One answer is that we've learned to live with it. Something that people are, mentally, going to have to do Covid. 

There also is the principle of acceptable risk. Thousands of people die by the flu, in automobile accidents, from smoking and drinking effects on the body, etc. Yet we aren't and haven't ever tried to regulate any of those factors (save for prohibition). The reason is that we have determined them to be an acceptable risk. We will have to do the same because there is no beating this virus. Sorry. Vaccines will help, but it isn't going away. So if your solution is to mask up forever and shutdown indefinitely, ignoring the needs of those whose lives are radically affected by such measures, you're being impractical, short-sighted, or both. 

I hope we can agree that China sucks and that protests in the streets, vma award show concerts, black friday shopping and arbitrary decisions on what businesses are essential or not are all ridiculous, though.",t2_8zlikgb5,dueNbAldarion,0,1606449384.0,0,t1_gdqegb3,gdqegb3,True,shuboni,t3_jxn8b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rexburg/comments/jxn8b1/sometimes_im_ashamed_to_say_i_live_here/,Sometimes I'm ashamed to say I live here,/r/rexburg/comments/jxn8b1/sometimes_im_ashamed_to_say_i_live_here/gdqegb3/,0,r/rexburg,0,0
"I'm pro whatever stops this virus.  You say everyone is going to get it?  For one, I've never caught the flu, so that argument is BS.  Two, how can we have countries with no new cases if, as you said, everyone is going to get it?

Your argument leads me to believe you're betting on either the vaccine or herd immunity.  Published tests say 95% efficacy for the vaccine, but it still needs to be seen to be believed.  As for herd immunity, the idea that you're immune once you've caught it, according to [the CDC,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html&ved=2ahUKEwizhpO-36HtAhUISq0KHbMEA78QFjALegQIFBAB&usg=AOvVaw13NnsRSrhTR5KjIjP2hU8i) while reinfection is rare, it isn't impossible.  According to newer findings published in [Science Magazine,](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/more-people-are-getting-covid-19-twice-suggesting-immunity-wanes-quickly-some) more and more people are getting reinfected, leading us to believe that immunity is only temporary.

If we don't stop the virus, it's just going to keep whittling away at us. More and more people will develop permanent damage, and the death toll will dwarf that of any other virus.",t2_5xi5j,shuboni,0,1606447085.0,0,t1_gdqb2y9,gdqb2y9,False,shuboni,t3_jxn8b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rexburg/comments/jxn8b1/sometimes_im_ashamed_to_say_i_live_here/,Sometimes I'm ashamed to say I live here,/r/rexburg/comments/jxn8b1/sometimes_im_ashamed_to_say_i_live_here/gdqb2y9/,3,r/rexburg,0,3
"Guess what? Your were always going to get it. Just like the flu. It's here to stay. If your solution is to lock everyone down for an indefinite amount of time and get spoon fed by the government for your expenses, you're being unrealistic. 

The science on masks has gone back and forth several times. And they are more about protecting other people than yourself. If you are really worried about getting this virus, which is, again, here to stay, then you should make the decision to quarantine. Not force everyone to abide by what makes you feel better. 

Now, for the record, if a private business or organization decides to mandate masks, they have the right. BYUI campus? They have the right. Blisters? They have the right. Great Scott's? They have the right. The government, however, does not have the right to mandate city or county wide mask requirements.

"Everything surrounding this case is so weird. My parents as well as my sister and her husband are in the same ward as Chad. His first wife, Tammy, was actually my sister’s good friend and ministering sister. There are so many little coincidences that make Lori Vallow look totally Off-The-Rails crazy and guilty. 

It’s going to really upset a lot of people in this community if she isn’t prosecuted for something more serious than her current charges, but my opinion is that the authorities just haven’t found any crucial evidence. They don’t have proof she actually did anything to the kids, Tammy’s autopsy likely won’t show anything incriminating because she was embalmed so quickly, and anything linking Lori to her ex and brother’s deaths is circumstantial at best. 

My speculation is that Chad knows way more than he’s let on and that he’s just unsure of how to rat on Lori without implicating himself. If he figures that out or strikes an immunity bargain with prosecutors, maybe she can be convicted. Who knows, maybe he can even end up with a nice profit from a book on the whole ordeal. *eye roll*",t2_q7m9tzp,josh_archangel,0,1583963202.0,0,t1_fk8ul53,fk8ul53,True,jendeon,t3_fh2epa,https://www.reddit.com/r/rexburg/comments/fh2epa/lori_vallowchad_daybell_case_missing_children/,Lori Vallow/Chad Daybell case.

"**Snake River Plain**

The Snake River Plain is a geologic feature located primarily within the U.S. state of Idaho. It stretches about 400 miles (640 km) westward from northwest of the state of Wyoming to the Idaho-Oregon border. The plain is a wide, flat bow-shaped depression and covers about a quarter of Idaho. Three major volcanic buttes dot the plain east of Arco, the largest being Big Southern Butte.

"I've assumed it refers to the Upper Snake River Valley, or the Snake River Plane. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_River_Plain

If you look at a map, most of the area from Island Park to Boise is in a valley between mountainous areas. The Upper Valley is the most northern section, including Rexburg. 

It just refers to the part of the valley that we live in. 

For another example, the Phoenix area is often called ""the valley,"" and different parts of phoenix are referred to as the east or west valley.

Edit: I assume you cant find anything specific about the upper valley because officially we live in the snake river plain, the upper valley is just a term locals have developed over the years, but doesnt refer to anything official.

Here is a good map that shows what I mean

"The fact that you won’t mention the company name speaks more about this op, than the sales pitch. Nobody cares about perks and office parties anymore. 

Upfront, what’s the pay, hours, benefits, location, and prerequisite skills?

You were upfront about the fact that it’s a call center gig, but kids these days are tired of being tricked into the next “amazing job opportunity”. Ping-pong tables are out. Cold hard information is in.

What exactly does it mean to “move up”? What exactly are the responsibilities gained by moving up? More importantly, how much is the pay increase from moving up? 

People don’t need to be sold on the idea of doing hard work. People will do hard work if it it’s worth it to them and they feel valued. People feel valued by paying them a reasonable market wage and providing them with base benefits and necessities. 

Remember kids, it’s a seller’s market. You are selling your time and labor. Companies can no longer pitch their beanbag chairs and free snacks and reel in thousands of interested candidates.

"First, let's talk numbers. If you've worked at a call center before, you've heard of adherence and conformance, right? Most of the time they want you in the mid-to-high 90's percentage wise. If you haven't heard of this metric before, it's basically how often you are on the phones and how closely you follow your schedule. I know, I've worked at places like that before. The company I'm at now realizes this isn't realistic. They want you to be working, sure, but they won't reprimand you unless you dip below 85%. Coachings aren't a roast fest and actually help you to improve and excel, you can move up in as little as 6 months, we regularly host celebrations, perks and discounts out the wazoo, and the lowest quota I've ever heard of. Get over an 8% product per call ratio and you automatically qualify for an extra $200 each month you reach it on top of whatever incentive you get for those products. Not to mention the people are pretty awesome.

Working for a call center normally feels like prison. Here, you feel like you can actually get out and do things to break up the monotony. The constant strive for positive interactions no matter who you're working with makes for a very friendly atmosphere as well. A team feels like a team, not a free-for-all.  Easiest way to experience it, though, would be to apply.

Most importantly? ALL INBOUND CALLS, MOST ARE CUSTOMERS WITH EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS.

"While living at the Apple tree apartments on 4th West, I experienced something very similar. It doesn't help that it was around Halloween time and there were some shows on TV that were all about trying to communicate with spirits in haunted places and, being really bored one night, I was briefly watching one of the shows just to see what it was about. After that, there was almost a palpable spirit of darkness in the apartment. I tried ignoring it for a while, but it wouldn't go away. So, being a Melchizedek priesthood holder, I decided to cast the spirit out and rededicate the apartment. After that, the dark spirit was gone and everything went back to normal.

"Are you going to be working? You said your partner is here and starting school? It will depend a lot on the kind of time you have.

"Asking people on reddit how to get social connections is a good way to get bad advice. 

Bad advice:
If you're into music, the music scene is getting started up again. The Romance theatre on Main Street is doing some trial concerts, and that's a good place to meet people with common interests.

There is also a hobby shop if you're into LoL, DnD, Magic, etc... They do a bunch of activities and the community is pretty alright.

Idaho Falls has a ski club that is mostly full of geezers, but they'll always send you invites to events that are pretty cool and you can find adventure buddies there. TGR (who does some pretty legit stuff) almost always screens their stuff in IF. 

Motorcycle = instant fraternity (and there are some great roads around here)

If you're willing to drive around a lot, you can have a really good time. It's a small town where nearly everyone establishes their social relationships through church (if you automatically see someone at least once a week you're probably going to end up being casual friends with them), so finding your niche can be tough, but it's an cool place if you let it be.
