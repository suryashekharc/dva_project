"Big debate here too.

I have Oboz Bridgers for winter hiking for the insulation. I have heard that the soles are not very grippy but I wear traction (microspikes, snowshoes) with them so I haven‚Äôt tested mine in that way. 
I have Adidas Mid Terrex R2 Swift (goretex) for shoulder season. The soles are sticky, the uppers are reasonably waterproof, they are light. 
I have Hoka Speedgoat Evos for dry, non-frigid conditions. Comfort and sole grip are amazing. But they have taken a beating - uppers not so durable.

I‚Äôll be trying the Altra Lone Peak 5 this year when my Speedgoats die. I‚Äôm up in the Whites so for me the soles cannot slip.

"I'm not really familiar with Agawam specifically, but I know the area a bit. As long as you can avoid the main gate area of the park, I think you shouldn't have much of a problem with traffic. The town itself isn't really a draw for anything besides Six Flags, and there's only one major road to get there, so I doubt you'll have any problems with crowds outside of there. 

Although noise could definitely be an issue. If you're close enough to see the tower, then you may be close enough hear the rollercoasters if you had your windows open. Then again, there's a lot of trees in the area, so that helps absorb sound. 

Not sure where you're moving from, but I wouldn't really consider Agawam to be the country though. You're right down the road from Springfield. Specifically, the Big E fairgrounds are also on this strip, which might be a bigger issue for you than 6 Flags, although that's just a couple weeks a year. And then Bradley is like 15 minutes south.

"Few people roll coal in Mass, I‚Äôd say.  You‚Äôll want to stick with more populated areas.  Some beautiful places up in the mountains, but way more conservative the farther away from cities you go.  

Check out Northampton MA.  Cool town, very liberal, 3 great small music venues that get nationally touring name acts.  Great restaurants.  Top notch marijuana dispensary right in town.  Great downtown retail/entertainment/dining district.  Near a bunch of colleges, not terribly far from Bradley International, and Springfield nearby has great doctors (Bay State is a great hospital out in Springfield), god forbid you should need it or maybe if you have kids, they would be a great place to go.  Springfield is the closest urban area, but it‚Äôs not wonderful.  Northampton is accessible to Boston for bigger urban needs, and you‚Äôre less than 3 hours to NYC should the urge strike you.  So close to endless outdoor activities, throw a stick in any direction and it will land on a trail or a river.  

If I lived in western MA, I myself would certainly choose Northampton.  I‚Äôm inside of 495, though.  Northampton is close-ish to the southern Vermont ski areas (Mt. Snow, Stratton, Magic, *Bromley*) as well as Berkshire East out in Western MA. 

You‚Äôre 27.  Great age.  You‚Äôd really like it there.  Kind of place you can really become part of a vibrant community and put some roots down without the crush (or cost of living) of a major metro area.  $227,000 a year will go very far in Western Mass.

"I grew up in Littleton.  It used to be a small little country  town amd is now a busy happening place.  Not too much in the way of land for sale in that area. Most of the land that used to be around has been bought up and already been turned into neighborhood's.  If it's land you're looking for then head west out Rt2 from Littleton or west out Rt290 towards Worcester for land. Littleton is about 40-45 minsbwest of Boston. So little farther west you'll get more bang for your buck. If it's a house you're looking to buy then the Littleton/Acton and surrounding towns are a great area to live and for $500-$700,000 price range you'll find a great home.

"While the other poster isn‚Äôt wrong about there being trump supporting areas of New England, I‚Äôm not sure what their point really is. On average New England rural areas are far *less* Trump supporting than rural areas in other parts of the country. Vermont only had 1 county vote for Trump despite being a rural state.

Also sounds like you‚Äôre more interested in the Boston metro area suburbs which don‚Äôt fall under what they are describing at all. So I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs relevant.

I will say, $350k for a house isn‚Äôt feasible in most places 1-1.5 hours from Boston. $700k is a fairly solid budget for some of those areas though. If you like Salem but want better schools, check out Marblehead, Beverly, and Newburyport. They are all old New England coastal towns with the walkability and density that comes with that (similar to Salem in that regard) but have better schools than Salem.

"I agree with this above person's advice about choosing one or the other, and honestly I also agree with those in the thread saying maybe just stick to the coast.

This is a weird time of year for interior New England and the mountains. On the whole it will still probably be pretty cold with the potential for snow, but it's also kind of too late for ski season and definitely too early to hike if you're not experienced with winter hiking.

The coast will be milder on average (though still probably all over the place in terms of temperatures). For instance, it looks like most days next week it will get into the 50s in Portsmouth, which while cold by California standards isn't bad for walking around and sightseeing. Whereas in Burlington it will ~10 degrees colder on most days next week and being in the 30s and low 40s will still feel more wintry.

Given you like small town shopping and quaint restaurants, I think you'd love taking the shore route up from Boston to Portland, ME. There are many classic New England coastal towns along the way. Take the Essex Coastal Scenic Byway (mostly route 127) along the North Shore of Massachusetts to hit a whole bunch of them, including Marblehead, Salem, Manchester (not the New Hampshire one), Gloucester, Rockport, Ipswich, and Newburyport. You can easily make a whole day of this leg of the trip and then spend the night in Newburyport, which has some great restaurants.

The next day, drive up to Portsmouth, NH and check it out. This is another great town with great restaurants and shopping. You could spend the day and night here before driving to Portland, ME the next day.

Portland is a bit bigger than the previous stops so you could spend a couple days there if you want. And then from there you can always head further up the Maine coast along route 1 for more New England coastal towns and scenery. Or double back to some of the previous spots you enjoyed the most (Portland is only a 2 hour drive from Boston so you could easily change plans last minute).

But Burlington, VT is great and with six days you could totally do it. I just personally think the coast would fit well with your stated interests and probably makes more sense this time of year. And if the goal is peaceful and relaxing you may not want to spend too much time driving around all of New England in a car.",t2_aiudb,WinsingtonIII,0,1646855914.0,0,t1_i00hwx7,i00hwx7,False,rittlette,t3_t68dtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/newengland/comments/t68dtx/six_day_new_england_roadtrip_next_week_leaving/,Six Day New England Roadtrip next week leaving from Boston?,/r/newengland/comments/t68dtx/six_day_new_england_roadtrip_next_week_leaving/i00hwx7/,1,r/newengland,0,1

"So ‚Äì¬†end of winter isn't great. Autumn post-tourist season is my favorite around here. But you can make do.

If I were you, I'd pick coast or mountains. Closest you're gonna get to both is Acadia up by Bar Harbor, ME. But going Portland to Burlington is straight through White Mountain Nat'l Forest. Problem being it's not summer hiking season, and it's kind of the tail end of skiing season. If you do ski, could be worth it.

If you'd rather do the coast, March is about the coldest the ocean gets around here, but it can still be pretty. That includes points south of Boston too, the Cape, Islands, and Rhode Island, etc.

Everything is much more ""packed in"" around here than in most of the US. There are a hundred-fifty little towns to visit you've never heard of that are about Burlington-sized or bigger. Some are outwardly tourism focused ‚Äì¬†like Falmouth and Newport and Bar Harbor. Others are not so much, but anywhere along the coast or near a ski slope will have tourism and scenery and quaint restaurants and small-village shopping. This whole region is just a series of small villages all nestled around every corner. Denser in the south, more forested in the north, but villages everywhere all the same.

Anyways, if you do go south, you can try the Cape or Newport and Mystic. Stop anywhere along US-1 and explore the coastline.

"The major tenants like Target, Dicks, and JCPenney have their own entrances and people park close to those and never go into the common space part of the ""mall"".   It might be more about little interior stores not doing well and there not being enough of them to be interesting, so if you wanted a cellphone store or something you'd just drive to one that's elsewhere in a storefront.  Someone going to this shopping area may have a specific plan, while if they just feel like ""going to the mall"" to browse, the much larger and more vibrant one in Holyoke isn't that much further to drive - say 12 miles vs 3-5 for the Hampshire Mall.

What's kind of ironic is that just across the street there's a Walmart, Barnes & Noble, EMS, Bed Bath, Whole Foods, carfting chain, and Marshalls forming a solid wall, and if you drive there it's a far enough walk between the various entrances that people tend to get back in their car and relocate it to the next store.  If I borrow a car to drive out there, starting it up just to move a distance just beyond reasonable walking feels silly enough that I'll often just not go into another store out of curiosity.   It all backs up to the bike trail, but a bike's limited capacity and lack of place to lock up a first set of purchases means that in the more common situations where I bike over, those are often one or two store trips.

The Trader Joe's across the parking lot seems to be hopping, the Aldi and Home Depot across rt 9 seem to do well.

So overall it's not a lack of market, it's that what the interior of the mall has to offer doesn't fit what the market wants or thinks it does.",t2_19fvuaof,UniWheel,0,1646323158.0,0,t1_hz72lov,hz72lov,True,thedjarty84,t3_t5u64q,https://www.reddit.com/r/newengland/comments/t5u64q/there_once_was_a_mall_that_was_busy_in_western/,"There once was a mall that was busy in western mass, and now is empty - what went wrong with the Hampshire mall",/r/newengland/comments/t5u64q/there_once_was_a_mall_that_was_busy_in_western/hz72lov/,6,r/newengland,0,6
"I went to UMass in the mid-90's, and there was actually another mall next to it that we referred to as ""the Dead Mall."" Now that mall has a WalMart, Barnes & Nobles, and a bunch of other stores that I hear are doing pretty well, as big retail goes.

The Hampshire Mall was never really busy by mall standards even then. It was run down and half-empty at the time and I remember a ton of vacancies there (though not nearly as bad as the Dead Mall). Since it only had a JC Penney and a K-Mart as anchor stores, most local students would drive to the the Holyoke Mall off I-91 which was about 30 minutes away. That was much more comparable to what I was used to in eastern Mass.

"Bubba's is absolutely a local treasure, but just to give you a little more info, it's also got a reputation for being pretty rowdy (in a fun lively way, not a bar brawl way, but still). I've had coworkers who grew up here describe it to me as ""the place you go to get drunk with your aunt"". It's also on a street that feels slightly sketchy - but this is sketchy by Portland standards, which is still very safe compared to most major cities. I live right in the neighborhood and don't feel unsafe, but I also don't walk down that street alone at night unless I absolutely have to.

Anyways, if your daughters are looking for a more chill (but still very fun) bar scene, I love The Jewel Box on Congress Street. There are tons of breweries in town - personally I'm not a huge beer drinker so I like Urban Farm Fermentory, which has ciders and kombucha and other interesting drinks. It's also a really nice space and they have live music sometimes.

There's a ton of good food here too; in addition to the places people have mentioned here already I'd recommend Norimoto Bakery, Cong Tu Bot, Crispy Gai, Empire, and Banh Appetit (can you tell I like Asian food?).

If your daughters like second-hand/vintage stores, check out Weekend Vintage, Find, and/or Flea For All.

For outdoorsy stuff that's a very short drive from town, I would recommend Two Lights State Park (disclaimer: no lighthouses actually in or visible from the park, but there are lovely ocean views) and Mackworth Island (you can drive onto it via a causeway - limited parking so you may need to park on the mainland and walk over the causeway when it's busy).",t2_e8cy3,thurn_und_taxis,0,1646320911.0,0,t1_hz6wy4w,hz6wy4w,False,rittlette,t3_t5ei9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/newengland/comments/t5ei9v/looking_for_not_to_miss_spots_in_portland_maine/,"Looking for ""not to miss"" spots in Portland, Maine and Portsmouth, NH",/r/newengland/comments/t5ei9v/looking_for_not_to_miss_spots_in_portland_maine/hz6wy4w/,2,r/newengland,0,2

"New England is a highly expensive area to live. Sure, you may find a job, but you‚Äôll be homeless until you‚Äôre making enough to afford an apartment. Idk about the other states, but New Hampshire doesn‚Äôt have very much to offer in terms of shelters, food banks, and homeless programs. Wait lines are extremely long, and if you settle somewhere with very little housing within walking distance of available jobs (most of the state, honestly) you‚Äôre kind of up the creek without reliable transportation.

As much as I would love to welcome you to this beautiful part of the country, I‚Äôm concerned your situation is too unstable and you‚Äôll end up worse off than you already are. This is a hard area to live if you aren‚Äôt in a stable financial situation. If you‚Äôre going to be homeless somewhere and starting from the ground up, maybe try a warmer area and work your way north. I hope you get to come here someday, I‚Äôm just not sure now is the right time.

"Depends wether or not you want a big city or more Vermont/Maine country environment to live in.

If you want a relatively calm, coastal city, New Haven would be phenomenal. The food is world renowned (legend has it the pizza is on par or better than a lot of what you'd find in New York) and it's not too far from even calmer coastal areas like Madison, Clinton, etc.

If you want big city, Boston is your choice. Hartford and Providence are great cities too but Hartford isn't by the coast and Providence is the edge of the New England pretty much. It's far from everything 

Connecticut and Massachusetts aren't far from RI, and they're also very close to the rest of New England.

If you want a coastal city close to Rhode Island, New London Connecticut would be a good option.

New Britain is known for its polish heritage, the same could be said for the New Haven Italians and there are large Chinese populations in Norwich CT by Mohegan sun.

For me personally, Connecticut is the perfect mix of country and city. We have major world players like Hartford and New Haven and I'm still only an hour or less from NYC, Mass, and Rhode Island. At any given point I'm less than a half an hour usually from the coast. If NYC is 10, and small Vermont towns are 1's, CT is where you can really find anything from 1 to 7.

">They do breakfast & dinner

Some huts *don't* do meals in the off season, which I love! Carter, Lonesome and Zealand are open mostly year round for much cheaper in the winter. You can use the kitchen yourself, so it's awesome to pack in a huge meal to cook since what else are you going to do when it's dark and 0F?! My favorite is to bring all the pizza ingredients, but on a lazy trip we bought a frozen pizza, snapped it in half so it would fit in the pack, and just made that.

They are about $40/nt winter and $120/nt summer. It's kinda wildly expensive for summer considering you get a bunk in a double or triple and there are a dozen or more people packed into each room, but worth the visit for those that can manage.

Providence is known as the ""creative capital"". We have excellent art and music scenes, which is why I personally love it so much here. There's lots of outdoor events downtown during the summer that celebrate local art & culture, and plenty of venues/bars around for live music. It's a pretty liberal city, and very LGBTQ+ friendly. 

It's definitely more affordable than Boston, and Boston is only about an hour away. Many Providence residents work in Boston & commute by train every day (the ride is about an hour one way).

"Portsmouth and Portland are both great little cities. Portland has more going on but Portsmouth is pretty awesome too.

Honestly, my two favorite places in New England though are the Stowe/Waterbury, VT area and the Littleton/Whitefield area up in NH. It is just incredible how such beautiful areas are just a few hours away from Boston.

"The toughest hikes that I can think of:

* Huntington's Ravine up Mount Washington. Arguably the toughest ascent in the Northeast. Please, please read and prepare for this. It's not a cake walk, and the weather at the base will be 70F and the summit 30F. If it rained or dropped below freezing the day before, do not try to ascend it. This is a one direction hike, so plan a loop. *Do not descend this trail*. Once you get to the headwall, you don't have a bail out option, so be sure the weather is clear for your ascent.

* North Tripyramid Slide (white mountains) Ascends about 1500' in .7 miles of open face rock. There is a bail out route on the east side of the slide that darts between the trees. You can descend this, but it is not recommended. Makes a loop with the South Tripyramid Slide.

* Precipice Trail in Acadia National Park. It isn't a really tough hike, but it will give you sweaty palms. It's short, but will have you hiking up a cliff side with multiple places with 100' drops. Another trail to avoid if it is raining. You'll be hanging off iron rungs on the side of a cliff, so they may be slick. To a lesser degree, Beehive Trail also in Acadia is its little brother.

* Knife's Edge in Baxter State Park/Katahdin. A narrow trail along a ridge with wild views and drops on both sides.

I want to say though, if you're not familiar with New England hiking, probably work your way up to some of these. If you want legitimately tough hikes, look up the ""Terrifying 25"" list of hikes in New Hampshire.

"[Brimfield antique flea market is mid July!](https://brimfieldantiquefleamarket.com) I don't know if that's your thing, but it's a huge event and it's great even to just walk and look around. It takes over the entire center of this tiny town. They usually get a bunch of food trucks too.

Northampton is always great to check out and has some cool book stores and shops. The [Eric Carle museum](https://www.carlemuseum.org/) is close by too. 

Up a bit further north is the Bridge of Flowers in Shelburne Falls, as well as the Butterfly Conservatory in Deerfield. Be sure to drop by Poets Seat Tower for an epic view.

"Any of the presidentials in NH are great, particularly Madison and Adams.  The Franconia loop ( little haystack Lincoln then Lafayette) is a must but plan a full day. Smaller hikes include Chocora, Cardigan or Kearsarge. If your seasoned hiker Mt. Moosilauke in the winter is awesome. 

If you can, Mt Katahdin in Maine is a good one to.

Two biggest things to do if you are hiking NH: get a hike safe card and have a bail out plan. Most transplants don't understand how dangerous hikes can be even though the elevation isn't anywhere near the Rockies. The weather changes quickly and most hikes the tree line ends around 3500-4000 ft leaving one exposed for hours.

"Mass Audubon's Joppa Flats location is great and they have touch tanks for kids. Also, I can't say enough good things about the Wenham Museum, they have tons of fun, unique things for kids to see and do. Current exhibitions include ones on:

*  **trains** (climb aboard a kid-sized train, take the Seek ‚Äòn Find challenge to search out tiny details, and go around the corner to explore the history of the ice industry ‚Äì including our kid-sized ice house and ice blocks ‚Äì that created the need for the real trains in Wenham that inspired our collection of models. Don‚Äôt miss this holiday treat for the whole family!)
* working **mechanical toys** ‚Äì the oldest one dates from the 1780s! These toys work using gears, levers, gravity, and other basic principles of physics and simple mechanics. This hands-on exhibit will safely introduce preschoolers and their caregivers to simple machines and help them practice hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills.
* **polo**, the ancient ‚Äúsport of kings,‚Äù first took hold in New York City in the 1870s and spread up the East Coast to Boston and the North Shore. For over 150 years, polo has been a local pastime. Learn about the history of the sport on the North Shore in this reprise of the polo section from our Equestrian Histories installation. The youngest (and young-at-heart!) visitors can try their hand at playing polo with our ride-on ponies and indoor polo field. (the museum is very close to the Myopia Hunt club, which has one of the oldest polo fields in America - it's super swank)

You might also want to check out the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem. It has a ground floor that has lots of interactive exhibits where the kids can touch and make things. The kids might enjoy Salem Willows, which is a short drive from there. They have bumper cars and ski ball. I would stay away from the witch stuff - cool, but waaaay too scary!

"Much of New England was farmland at one time (apart from the Maine wilderness, anyway).  It's been said that even with the explosion in population growth here since Colonial days, there are now more trees than at any time since the early 19·µó ∞ century.  What's shown in this photo is mostly young-ish trees, with most of them being only a few decades old.  So it's a good bet to assume that this was farmland or pasture until the 1970s or 80s.  This is the first answer to the question, ""Why am I finding a stone wall in the woods?  Who would have made that, and why?""  (Stone walls found in woods are generally over a hundred years old, long enough to have been abandoned as farmland and for the woods to have grown, but the fields were probably used for decades prior to that abandonment.)

But the primary reason why stone walls exist at all is that's the most efficient way to remove stones from a field or pasture.  I'm not going to go into the math, but proofs of that are available if anyone wants to look for it.  Walls are more efficient than piling all the rocks in a central location, and they can also be useful.  So: the hillside was part of someone's farm, and they wanted or needed to use the field.  Because it has that southern exposure (evidenced from the shadows; in the winter the sun is nearly always mostly in the south), this would have been good growing land, except for that slope.  Sloping land is hard to raise crops on, and with New England's thin topsoil, heavy rains could be ruinous.

So my guess is that the farmer who owned this wanted to plant it, but to do that he needed to get stones out of the field, first, and also wanted to terrace the land a bit so that erosion wouldn't have been disastrous to whatever topsoil he did have.",t2_fuhhj,chris06095,0,1644944822.0,0,t1_hx21miz,hx21miz,True,[deleted],t3_st03i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/newengland/comments/st03i5/what_might_be_the_reason_for_terracing_this_small/,What might be the reason for terracing this small hill with six parallel stone walls?,/r/newengland/comments/st03i5/what_might_be_the_reason_for_terracing_this_small/hx21miz/,22,r/newengland,0,22

"Are the walls parallel, or perpendicular to the road?

If they are perpendicular to the road, maybe, at one point, each space between a set of walls belonged to a different farmer (all sons of the original father? The father split his land amongst his sons), and this was a way to give each son access to the road as the land was divided into smaller parcels. Maybe each ""lane"" was a road at one point? If you were interested enough, you could find out when each nearby road was added.

An interesting fact about New England stone walls is that combined, there is more stone in NE stone walls than all the Pyramids of Egypt.

"Nashua & Manchester are cheap - Manchester has more going on than Nashua. East side of the former and tree streets of the latter tend to be rougher areas. No public transit, drive gets kinda far by Manchester, and Tolls on the Everett after Nashua too.

Lowell feels like more of a city than Nashua. But there's not a ton going on either. Closer to Boston. More expensive. Gallagher will get you to North Station, but it's not super convenient. Acre and back central are the roughest neighborhoods generally. Lawrence is further and poorer and rougher than Lowell, more affordable though.

Worcester has more going on. If you're willing to pay the pike, that's a way in. Public transit too. Main South can get rough.

Providence has the most going on by far of any of your list. But you're going to have to pay 2 income taxes if you live there and work in MA, even if you get some back at the end of the year.

"You‚Äôve said somewhat close to Boston, so I‚Äôll advocate my hometown in CT: West Hartford. Those who have seen my other posts will know that I‚Äôm somewhat of a townist (is that even a word? Patriotic but for your town? Idk). But your criteria are: affordable, safe, family friendly.For safe, you can look up the stats, but I‚Äôm relatively sure the violent crime rate here is barely existent, if not zero. I‚Äôm fairly certain the murder rate is zero, and most crimes are petty theft and carjacking, but only in certain part of town at night.For family friendly, I‚Äôm assuming you mean children. We have some of the best public schools in CT (and our high schools, there are two) are ranked in the top 5% nationally (I read that somewhere, don‚Äôt quote me). The town (which has a population of 60K plus) has several elementary schools, parks, and other recreational spots. Plenty of places to take / send your kids to lessons in sports, music, etc.As for affordable, we bought our house for around 350K.

"Based on your criteria and snooping in your post history  I think that Providence, Lowell and Worcester are you best options. All three of those cities have large student populations, have an arts and music scene, great food and are relatively affordable. 

Manchester and Nashua are fine, I just think they are more boring, dont have as much of a social and cultural scene for young people and dont have a public transportation connection to Boston. The only city on your list I would avoid is Lawrence. I think its a cool place to visit, has a pretty nice downtown and a lot of great food but there are a ton of problems there and there isn't much to do unless you like drinking and dancing to reggaeton. 

I know the most about Lowell, I grew up in Chelmsford which is a neighboring suburb. Its definitely not Boston but Lowell has a lot going on. The University has a big impact on the city, there's a lot of students and nightlife for young people. There's places to hear live music in the city, I'd check out the website for the Lowell Summer Music series and there's a burgeoning art scene. I'd definitely recommend Mill No. 5 and the Western Ave Studios. I dont know if you have kids but the school system in Lowell is also pretty good. 

There's an absolute ton of good food in Lowell. Get pizza at Espresso, Simply Khmer is great Cambodian food, Life Alive is the best vegetarian I've had in my life. The Owl Diner is my favorite breakfast place. Theres way too many great places to list. Merrimack St is the main downtown street along with Market and Middle streets are where a lot of the culture is. It's about 40 minutes on the train to North Station, and with no traffic  its about 30 minutes to Boston driving so it's easy to get into the city when you want to. 

Lowell has its problems like every city, certainly with opiates and homelessness but it really is a safe city despite what some people will tell you. It was something like 50th for crime of towns in Massachusetts year behind places like Cambridge and Northampton. The only area I would definitely tell you to avoid is around Appleton St. Its Lowell's answer to the Methadone Mile and is the epicenter of drugs and homelessness in the city. 

There are a few other ""rougher"" sections of Lowell, around Fletcher and Broadway St in the Acre ( anywhere named after anything in Ireland), the area around the intersection of Chelmsford and Westford streets in the Highlands, and the low number streets (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.) in Centralville ( Always pronounced Centahville I have no idea why) across the river. However even those areas really aren't all that bad and I wouldn't rule them out completely if you found a place you liked. Everywhere else in Lowell is pretty nice. 

I dont know Worcester that well but I think overall is has a very similar vibe to Lowell rough around the edges and with a lot of students, good food and stuff to do for young people. Providence is the closest to a ""Big City"" feel in New England other than Boston, also has a lot of students and cultural activities.

"It's a turn based post zombie cataclysm survival game. It's set in a modern day New England except that scientists working for a sketchy company discovered inter-dimensional travel. This seems to have broken reality. Now there's all kinds of horrors in the world and they evolve and grow more monstrous as time goes on. The blob is an entity from one of the other dimensions. During a ""portal storm"" where our reality was crashing into others repeatedly, the blob rained down on earth for a while. It seems to bind and alter living beings. This drove most of the human population crazy and makes them come back to life after dying. This affected all living beings, mutating and changing them. There are now mole rats the size of cars tunneling underground. Giant bugs of all kinds. Feral carnivorous deer. There are being from other dimensions as well, very few of them don't want to kill and eat you.

 The base game uses ASCII art and is heavily inspired by Rogue. It's a really niche game that leans more towards realism than gameplay balance. Which is interesting because you wouldn't expect it at first glance. The game is open source with a core dev team, meaning anyone can contribute content to the game but they get the final say on what's actually accepted. There are also mods that change the core game entirely. One introduces magic, spells and a bunch of fairytale horrors. Another goes full cyberpunk and has you getting murdered by giant autonomous killbots.

I really like it because most of the time, everything that happens makes sense in a real world context. Whenever I come across a problem in game, I can think up a completely novel real world solution to it, and then use that solution in the game. If something is missing from the game or doesn't make sense, it's not hard to add it yourself or reach out to the dev team and have it added.

This game is not for everyone. Learning the game at the start is less of a curve and more a wall you have to climb. Because you can do pretty much anything you can think of, the controls and menus and whatnot can really frustrate new players before they even have a chance to get killed by their first zombie.",t2_j6daz,TheOtherCrow,0,1644256740.0,0,t1_hvz021l,hvz021l,False,TheOtherCrow,t3_smf0ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/newengland/comments/smf0ds/what_do_you_call_this_tool_in_new_england/,What do you call this tool in New England?,/r/newengland/comments/smf0ds/what_do_you_call_this_tool_in_new_england/hvz021l/,7,r/newengland,0,7

School budget gets proposed with how it‚Äôs going to get divided up. Town votes either approving or disapproving. If it‚Äôs not passed it‚Äôs talked about . Say we want more or less money going to school supplies. It‚Äôs gets rewritten then passed.
Planning and zoning in town. We have a elected commission that oversees everything. When changes are proposed a town meeting is held. Example I‚Äôm from CT. CT has a right to farm law but left it up to the towns to see how they want to regulate it.
Someone brought it up the townspeople showed up we all talked about it what we liked didn‚Äôt like. Then voted on it. Now everyone no matter where your located can sell vegetables to flowers without a permit. Put up a 200 sq ft greenhouse/shed without a permit provided it‚Äôs x feet away from property line.

">effective form of government

That is rather subjective in the way it implicitly incorporates what a given person believes government should do.

For example, it can sometimes be hard to get a school budget passed, since citizens who don't want their property taxes to go up in response to rising expenses can just keep voting the budget down, without really having to come up with an alternative that fulfills legal obligations.  They're great civic education for high school students newly voting age eligible (or aware in anticipation of that birthday), especially when those students are devoted to budget-threatened programs.

In a representative body you can traditionally bargain and reach some compromise and have a sense if it's going to pass when put to a vote by a limited number of city council members.  With a town meeting and referendum type direct democracy vote it's harder to know what degree of cuts are needed to get something that can pass.

It goes without saying that certain representative legislative bodies have in the past couple of decades started to see some more town-meeting-curmudgeon type opposition without any interest in finding a solution.",t2_19fvuaof,UniWheel,0,1643223826.0,0,t1_huby9d6,huby9d6,True,CourtofTalons,t3_sd9b81,https://www.reddit.com/r/newengland/comments/sd9b81/have_new_england_town_meetings_proven_to_be_a/,Have New England town meetings proven to be a successful and effective form of government?,/r/newengland/comments/sd9b81/have_new_england_town_meetings_proven_to_be_a/huby9d6/,3,r/newengland,0,3

">Hey! Could you emphasize on bit by bit? I am scared if I will pickup lot of speed and can‚Äôt stop on the bigger hill.

The key skill, and something to practice on the little hill, is that you don't go straight down the hill, rather you go back and forth sideways across the hill, reducing the slope, and thus your rate of descent.  If need be, you can even make the horizontal part aim slightly back up the hill, bringing you to a stop.

For a beginner these will be really big switchbacks.  Later on as you get used to moving faster and different methods of turning, they'll be very short and rapid switches between the edges on one side of your skis and those on the others.

Another very useful skill is learning how you can stand unmoving with your skis sideways to the hill and if you bend your knees slightly downhill start to slide down sideways, then point your knees back into the hill to make your edges bite again, stopping you.  This can be key for getting down a brief stretch too steep for your comfort.  Since you're barely moving, ""falling"" is just about your uphill hip landing on the snow.

All of these are things to practice on the shortest slope, so that they're familiar when you take the lift to the top and do the easiest green run down the full mountain.  Sometimes that green run will have stretches that are too gentle a slope to even keep moving, so you also want to make sure you've learned how to ""skate"" to propel yourself.

>I am curious if it is possible to star somewhere in the middle on the bigger hill and ski down

Midway chair lift platforms used to exist but have probably all been torn out due to accidents.  Just like when unloading you had to keep your ski tips up - and forward, but unlike at the top, people tend to be distracted and not preparing to unload.  Once as a kid I was sitting lazily with my skis pointed outwards at an angle, and they hit the fence at the midway platform twisted around and were dragged through backwards.  Kind of surprised they didn't release and I didn't break anything... youth.

Also midway platforms preclude having a ski rest on the safety bar.

And anyway, the run under the lift tends to be one of the steepest and most challenging, so a midway platform would also need a beginner trail that crossed the mountain at that point.

My most enjoyable skiing experiences were with family groupings where we'd descend for a couple of minutes, then pull over and watch the last / youngest catch up, the most experienced adult would make some suggestions and we'd set off again.  In contrast my least enjoyable was a date with a former childhood ski racer who as we got off the lift said ""see you at the bottom"".

">Their beginner hill is very small, so jumping to the next hill seems like it is going to be significantly difficult there.

Typically you just take a green run on a bigger hill bit by bit, using the strategies for moving down in a zig-zag fashion that you've developed on the little beginner hill.

There isn't really any point to driving for a different beginner experience - especially when much of what you get by travelling is a longer run, wheras you're probably looking for a shorter descent ""commitment"" with the break of the lift line, and lift ride in between.  Sure, bigger mountain resorts will all have a beginner area, but what you get by is longer runs, not better beginner experiences.   

You might avoid the weather conditions when the snow is likely to be icy though.

"**[Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)** 
 
 >The Holodomor (Ukrainian: –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æÃÅ—Ä, romanized: Holodomor, IPA: […¶olodoÀàm…îr]; derived from –º–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–∏ –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º, moryty holodom, 'to kill by starvation'), also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It was a large part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933. The term Holodomor emphasises the famine's man-made and allegedly intentional aspects such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs and restriction of population movement.

"There will be fall colors in October, but it's impossible to predict when things will really peak. I suggest you plan out all the small towns, overlooks, and destinations you want to visit and wait as late as you can to pick the actual dates. In late August/Sept they should at least be able to say if fall is coming early or late. I know that isn't always feasible, though. Just aim for October. You'll definitely see some color somewhere along your drive, especially if you're flexible and willing to drive a couple hours out of your way one day.

"As part of your planning, plan to stay off of the freeways/interstate.  You can't appreciate anything at 50+ MPH.    You need to get into the small towns and, stop at overlooks, and if you're able to walk for 30 minutes, walk some easy trails to get the full appreciation of fall colors.  

Also, avoid the weekend.  Even during the week, popular places may need day-before reservations to get to the best spots -- e.g. Acadia National Park needs a reservation to drive past certain intersections.  

What I've done the past two years is to get an AirBnB/VRBO in a central place, and then I can go north for a half hour if peak colors isn't there yet, or south for a half hour if peak has past.

After the siege and subsequent evacuation of Boston in March 1776, 600 colonial militia were placed there to watch for a possible British return.  This is celebrated in Massachusetts officially as Evacuation Day so that we can have a holiday on the same day as St. Patrick's Day without running afoul of the Commonwealth's rules on not having a religious based holiday.

">One common example is the reflexive, and you can see this in the motto on the Quebec license plate, ""Je me souviens"". It means ""I remember"", though if literally translated would say ""I me remember"". Many native francophones in the US have done the same when first learning English, just out of habit, and this was lampooned in a once-popular Rhode Island bumper sticker, ""I [heart] Woonsocket Me"".

Just so you know , this is a bad exemple since je me souviens is the only correct way of saying it.

Je souviens is improper both in France and Quebec. It's a special type of verb that require the reflexive.

A better exemple would be : ""tu veux tu"" wich mean ""do you want"" but is litteraly translated to : ""you want you"". This isn't said in France but is common in Qu√©bec.

"Just a heads up, completely skip Hartford and most of those Mass cities. Take 95 north from New York, drive along the coast, hit up Mystic and Providence before Boston then you're in Maine.

"How much time do you have? And what's your budget?

If you're driving up from New York, I'd suggest this itinerary, not knowing anything about your interests or timeline:

1. New Haven, CT. Really cool city with great restaurants, fantastic architecture, and the Yale University Art Gallery is excellent and free. The pizza is there is better than New York. 
2. The Connecticut shoreline is fun: RJ Julia in Madison is an excellent bookstore in a cute town, and Old Lyme has the legendary Bookbarn and the Florence Griswold Museum. 
3. Mystic, CT is a must-see (but ignore the shopping plaza confusing called Old Mystic Village). It's a beautiful touristy town. Stonington Borough is really cool as well, although mostly domestic. Great atmosphere. Around there, in Noank, CT, eat at Abbot's if you want a lobster roll. 
4. Rhode Island has exceptional beaches, although they're probably going to be too cold for swimming during your trip. However, Newport, RI is another must-see. Historic city with beautiful historic mansions. 
5. Providence is also worth checking out, and then it's an easy trip to Boston. This does cut out the Cape, but you've got to make some sacrifices and there's not going to be much going on that time of year. 
6. You don't need my advice on Boston, I imagine. There's tons out there. I'm a museum guy so I'd say the Isabella Stewart Gardiner Museum is a priority, but everybody has their own things to see. 
7. Heading north, Salem, MA and Portsmouth, NH are very much worth checking out. Maine has beautiful beaches and then you're in Portland. 
8. Heading back, swing inland. I'd strongly recommend you explore the White Mountains in New Hampshire. They're really majestic and it gives you a very different sense of New England. 
9. Drive home via 91. You can see Hanover, NH and Brattleboro, VT. Northampton,  MA is a really cool place and definitely worth a stop: its a funky college town all kinds of great little shops, restaurants, etc. Deerfield, MA is a hidden gem. 
10. Final scenic detour would be to head into Northwestern CT on your way back to New York and explore the Litchfield Hills. There are some really lovely little towns with all kinds of foody stops available.
