">Utah Lake’s recovery is now a top priority for state leaders, but how to restore it has become a bone of contention, pitting scientists, Native Americans and environmentalists against real estate developers who say they can dredge the lake back to health.

...

>Growing up here, Holdaway heard stories about the Native Americans who once roamed the valley and survived on abundant fish pulled from the lake.

>“I just thought it was so strange that they lived here, yet nobody around here knew that they were here and that this was their land,” says Holdaway during a recent visit to the family’s property. “I knew they would build these shelters called wickiups. When I was little kid, I’d be like, ‘Oh, I’m going down to the property and I’m going to build a wickiup.’”

>Holdaway is the visionary behind Walkara Way, a proposed nature preserve on 1,000 acres of private land along the shore. By stitching together a series of easements, he hopes to develop a public-access pathway between Provo and Vineyard, part of a 98-mile trail that someday would encircle the entire lake.

...

>The plan is to plant up to 5,000 trees, build three miles of trail, reestablish wetlands with the help of artificial beaver dams and construct raptor nests. Holdaway also wants to put cows on the land to knock back the phragmites, the 10-foot-high invasive reeds choking the shorelines.

>“We’re not going to have any deer, we’re not going to have any elk come back at the levels that we need to maintain a healthy ecosystem. They’re just not going to come back,” says Holdaway, who lives on the family’s original homestead beside Shadrach Holdaway’s still-standing tiny historic home, surrounded by rapidly expanding subdivisions and a golf course.

>“The dairy farmers went bankrupt between 1998 and 2003,” he adds. “So there’s no hoofed animals to send down there to have a natural cleaning.”

>To demonstrate cattle can get the job done at minimal cost, he turned 30 head onto 50 fenced acres last year. After about three months, most of the phragmites were gone. Holdaway was not in it for the money, but the rancher who owned the cattle paid him $1,500.

...

>Rushforth and other scientists who study the lake reject this characterization of the lake’s condition, arguing current restoration efforts — like phragmites and carp removal along with habitat restoration — are working. Endangered June suckers are rebounding and algal blooms are declining, except in Provo Bay.

>“The lake restoration people are doing their best to spread, to deepen the negative narrative,” Rushforth says. “The lake is not toxic. The lake is not deeply polluted. The lake has lots of nutrients and always has had. The lake is very productive and always will be.”

>The company behind the Utah Lake Restoration Project argues the lake is terminally ill due to accumulated pollutants in lakebed sediments. It proposes deepening the lake by 7 feet and sequestering the contaminated sediments into 34 new islands, some of which would be developed. According to the promotional literature, the result would be a clear, clean lake with beaches and navigable water for recreation.

>What dredging proponents call “restoration,” however, Mary Murdock Meyer describes as desecration of a sacred place. Her people may no longer live in Utah Valley, but she says they deserve a say in what happens to the lake that sustained their ancestors.

>Like the endangered June suckers, the Timpanogos “have endured near extinction and deserve to live,” Meyer says. “Think about tomorrow and the future generations. We, as native people, say you must look ahead seven generations when making decisions because what we decide today affects future generations.”",t2_10tmvp,Insultikarp,0,1648750724.0,0,t1_i2vnmcu,i2vnmcu,True,Insultikarp,t3_tt61ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahValley/comments/tt61ws/how_utah_lake_once_sustained_tribes_and_mormon/,How Utah Lake once sustained tribes and Mormon pioneers and why it needs help,/r/UtahValley/comments/tt61ws/how_utah_lake_once_sustained_tribes_and_mormon/i2vnmcu/,1,r/UtahValley,0,1
"Chiming in very late here, but I wanted to possibly clarify a few things. I live right on the border of Saratoga Springs and Lehi. The mink farms definitely smelled gnarly, and the only way you ""get used to it"" is just to come to terms that it is going to be there.

That said, as far as I know there are only 1 or 2 still operating in the area, and in my opinion, the mink smell has improved. It was already usually quite localized, but sometimes the wind would blow just the right way and it would travel. I can't recall that happening for some time now.

The problem that people interested in the area might run into though, is that minks are not the only generators of flies and stink around here.

• A common complaint about the mink farms were fly infestations, but I think that was a bit of a misconception. The thing is, the closer you get to Utah lake, the fly and mosquito population grows exponentially. I live nowhere near a mink farm, but as soon as it warms up, you can't go outside in the evening unless you want to have every possible surface of your body attacked by mosquitos and biting flies. By mid to late summer, our house is full of house flies, despite our attempts to employ every technology and tactic to kill them. It's not that the traps and stuff don't work, it's just that you can't kill enough to do more than keep from being overrun. I don't think a lot of people who are moving near a lake or pond get to experience this before buying.  


• There are stagnant pools of water and marshes everywhere the further south you get. Not only do they contribute to the aforementioned bug problems, they also smell bad and that intensifies in the warm months due to the algae blooms.  


• The large population of skunks and raccoons means that many brave vermin lose their lives each night in the never ending battle to cross the road. In the more farmy areas, you can tell where the skunks live because it always smells like them. I think this is an under-appreciated source of stink in the area, though I suppose it will steadily improve through attrition as traffic increases and habitat decreases. I should note, however, if you are lucky enough to see a mother skunk with her babies and they aren't already spraying you, they are incredibly adorable.

• There are still plenty of cattle farms in the area, and even people with fairly small yards might have 1 or 2. I don't think most people find the general smell of cows offensive. However, I made a discovery a couple of years back about how cows that die are disposed of, which for several of the farms in my area is to just drag the carcass to the back of the lot and throw it onto the corpse pile to rot. I don't know if this is the standard method of livestock disposal, but I do know that 4 or the farms near where I live do this. It didn't take a lot of detective work - I was walking one of the city's paved trails adjacent to a cattle farm with maybe a 25-30 foot buffer zone in between. I noticed what looked like a bone in the wooded buffer zone, and went to have a look. As I walked into the area, I saw that it was actually strewn with bones everywhere. Approaching the fence, I noted the more fresh pile of dearly departed moo cows right up next to the fence. Clearly, the buffer area used to be the cow graveyard, and it just got scooted back a bit. I started looking more carefully at the rear of properties like this, and discovered more of the same. As you might imagine, the smell and thoughts of groundwater contamination were a bit... unsettling.

• Utah lake stinks like fish and urine when the toxic algae blooms, and this smell DOES get blown around, frequently.

I know this was quite an essay, I just wanted to throw it out there. I feel bad when I ask the latest tech sales bro how he is liking the area, and you can see a slight quiver run through his sturdy PED nurtured Crossfit frame, a bead of sweat rolling down the side of his face as the facade drops for just the slightest instant - before he yells, a little *too* enthusiastically, ""Bruh, Silicon Slopes is unreal. My single family home only cost me 500k! Isso *bitchin'!*"", and does a burnout in his entry level beamer.

I really like it here, though I probably won't be able to afford to live here too much longer. Realistically, all of these issues are probably going to go away as development continues. Except the bugs. And probably the toxic algae in the lake. And the sales bros. But that one is like, universal.",t2_1sa8bhn5,doc_sav,0,1647505983.0,0,t1_i0zumme,i0zumme,True,Electrical_Award_169,t3_pq2k4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahValley/comments/pq2k4q/mink_farm_and_smells_around_holbrook_farms_area/,Mink farm and smells around Holbrook farms area,/r/UtahValley/comments/pq2k4q/mink_farm_and_smells_around_holbrook_farms_area/i0zumme/,1,r/UtahValley,0,1

>Utah Lake is the heart of Utah Valley — sovereign lands belonging to the people of Utah. In the discussion to restore, rehabilitate, protect the ecosystems and repair Utah Lake, we are fortunate to have an expert, Ben Abbott, who has studied this lake for many years.

>Just hours before the January 11, 2022 Utah Lake Summit, co-hosted by Conserve Utah Valley, Ben was served with a $3M lawsuit initiated by Lake Restoration Solutions. Lake Restorations Solutions was invited to participate in the Utah Lake Summit and the video of the meeting is available online.

>Over the past year, we’ve shared the stage with Ben, met public officials with Ben, and engaged in public dialogue with Ben. In every interaction, Ben has been civil, engaging, thoughtful, inclusive and kind. His approach is the model for how civil dialogue on important public issues should be the standard.

>Conserve Utah Valley vigorously supports the First Amendment rights of all Utah citizens to speak freely. Public dialogue, questions, and opinions are a fundamental right and part of the public process and should not be quashed by any party.

>The Utah Lake Summit was an important effort to open dialogue, share information, and provide the public with places where they could learn about the many efforts to care for Utah Lake.

>However, that goodwill and all requests to meet with Lake Restoration Solutions prior to the meeting were met with rejection.

>Now, one of the strongest advocates for the importance of the Utah Lake ecosystem could be silenced without your help. It will take all of us to send a message loud and strong that the public must have a voice in any process, and especially one where such a drastic change to the ecosystem is proposed.

>Support the lake. Support the science. Support Ben Abbott by donating to the legal fund today. Show your support for robust public dialogue and discussion, and even disagreement, regarding claims being made by any proposal.

>100% of funds collected through this fundraiser will be directed to Ben’s legal defense fund. In the event that the funds collected exceed the actual legal fees and costs, any remaining funds will be directed toward Utah Lake-related research and conservation initiatives.

Lake Restoration Solutions is barely disguised greenwashing grift that is well-crafted to funnel land from the ownership of the public commons (*our* land), decimate the slowly but steadily recovering Utah Lake ecosystem, and perpetuate lazy suburban sprawl at this aforementioned taxpayer and environmental expense, further contributing to decreasing air quality, energy waste, and social atomization. It is a sleazy, greedy project, and this organization is attempting to silence experts and critics through frivolous lawsuits and intimidation.

"There are all kinds of folks in Utah with lots of different tastes.

The most important thing is to be you. Accept and present the ways you are unique. Be comfortable in your own skin and don't try to be someone you're not.

The next most important thing is good grooming- be clean and present a good appearance. If you feel you're unattractive because you're too heavy, work on your fitness. You don't have to be a supermodel, but you do need to communicate that you care about your health.

And finally, you don't have to be an extrovert, but say hello to people and talk to others. If you're too shy to do this, have a mutual friend introduce you. You can't meet people if you don't reach out. You'd be surprised how many people would love to meet you, but are hesitant to take the first step.

One of the best things in Utah is that lots of people are looking for long-term relationships– both friendships and romantic. If one relationship doesn't work out, don't get discouraged, meet someone new.

I live in the area and I dislike mink farms but I will absolutely side with them over those that want them gone. They’ve been here for generations. 20 yrs ago this whole city was farmland and they were far away from developments. They shouldn’t have to move just because others now want to live where they are at. And it’s not just a matter of picking up and moving to the outskirts again. I can’t remember all the reasons they’ve given in the past but it includes things like needing to be within the delivery range for the feed trucks.

"Yep, it's worse across 2100 at The Exchange, but that whole area gets pretty bad.  Some people claim they get used to it and don't notice the smell anymore but I'm skeptical.

When we were looking for a home we considered a number of properties in that area.  We ended up buying elsewhere, but visited that part of town many times over the course of a couple months.  It was hit or miss, but we noticed the smell maybe 30-40% of the times we visited that area.

Many people are hoping to outlast the farmers, but if you watch the local facebook pages some of these guys intend to die on their farms and no amount of developer money will change their minds.  A guy in his 60's could last another 20+ years - realistically what are the odds you'll still be in that home in 20 years?

I'm not saying don't go for it, like I said some people say they get used to it and plenty of people tolerate it.  But don't buy hoping that things are going to change.

"Really depends on the neighborhood.  Most places you can do Comcast and Centurylink.  Some areas with good line of sight (no trees) can do microwave like Rise Broadband and UBB and Vivint.  T-mobile has home 5g.  I think there are a few neighborhoods with fiber but sadly not mine.

Here's my experiences:

Century Link - I liked the price for life option, don't have to call up every year and threaten to cancel.  But the network was too unstable.  Service dropped all the time, had to reboot the box weekly.  

Comcast - Connection is pretty solid, I rarely get outages.  Gotta deal with the usual comcast garbage of promo rates.  If you rent their box if comes with a built in guest hotspot for any comcast customers.

T-Mobile 5G - I was on the waitlist so I tried this one immediately as it released, it's been a year or two so maybe things are better today.  Customer service with this one was great, it's nice to talk to a person when you have an issue, even when I cancelled they didn't try to strong arm me into staying.  We're a heavy use household (1.5+ TB / month) and the network just couldn't keep up.

My neighborhood had lots of trees so the fixed microwave never worked for me.

"Orem rec and PG rec both have indoor tracks, but they will charge admission for non-city residents. Someone told me a while back that the PG track is free for PG residents, so that might be an option if you live there. (I like the PG rec center, but I live in Lindon, so I've always had to pay.)

The Murdock trail is nice because it's relatively flat, but it's not pre-measured. In the past, I've used Google maps to determine the length between starting and stopping points. Alternatively, I've heard some of my co-workers mention an app that will use your phone's GPS to tell you exactly how far you've gone. 

I've also heard really good things about Planet Fitness in Orem, but I've never been there myself. (I now have a treadmill in my basement that I don't use nearly as often as I should.) PF will let you pay month-to-month without any kind of commitment.

"This is were I learned to disc golf! I spent a lot of time there about 10-15 years ago, but haven't been back down there for a long time. It's a shame that most of the baskets are gone now. 

The course used to keep going past hole three over to the power station and then up the hill to the east and behind those shrubs and trees at the top of your map. There was lots of construction going on to the north and east of the park, and I assume that area is full of homes now.

There also used to be another basket at the bottom where the dog park is now. You started to the east of the pond and would have to throw over it. We had all gone swimming in there for our lost discs at one time or another.

One of the most underappreciated hikes is [Rock Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RockCanyon.jpg) in Provo.  The best time to go is at night on a full (or nearly full) moon with a clear sky.  The moon throws some pretty dramatic shadows.  You don't have to hike all the way up, and on the hike back down you get a nice view of the city.

You can also drive to [Squaw Peak](http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I00000WbMB5Sqtlw/s/860/860/20110917-SquawPeak-001.jpg) and watch the sunset.  It's a nice drive and definitely worth it.

"July's Freedom Festival in Provo is quite the ""county fair"" gathering. Also, Stadium of Fire around Independence Day is a huge deal.

Campus-wise, there's UVU and the LDS church-owned BYU.

Since most of the population is LDS, religion plays a big part in the culture here--some of the big sights for that are the Provo Temple, Provo City Center Temple, Mount Timpanogos Temple, and Payson Temple (they're eye-catching buildings, def worth a photo or two). Also part of the ""pioneer heritage"" culture here is Pioneer Day, observed on July 24 and commemorating the Mormon pioneers' first arrival in the Salt Lake valley in 1847. With fireworks being allowed, it's kind of like a second Independence Day around here.

For visitors, the mountains are a big draw. I'd recommend drives up the many canyons, and a hike up to Timpanogos Cave.

"Black Sheep is awesome.

Four Seasons Hot Pot and Dumplings is really tasty and different. I've heard the dumplings are amazing but the wife wasn't there the day I went, so I was left dumplingless.

180 Tacos is like 80% of the taco flavor of Masa, at a fraction of the cost.  It's right by Maglebys Fresh.

Station 22 is delicious, though it can be hit and miss sometimetimes. Last time I was there I had the shrimp and grits and wow. They were stellar. They also have a cool 'root beer bar' for those who don't imbibe. I recomennd the Virgils Special Bavarian.

I second Bam Bams for BBQ. It is stellar but the sides leave a bit to be desired.

Smoking Apple is also a stellar BBQ place but the meat isn't as good as Bam Bams (and it's cheaper) The sides blow Bam Bams out of the water though.

Lucys Pizza for authentic NY pizza. Super thin crust, great toppings. It is a chain, but not a large one. Authentic NY Pizza from and Idaho chain!?  It's tasty. You won't regret it.

That's all I can think of right now. Got to get back to work!

Edit: These are all pretty casual places, except maybe Black Sheep.

"There are a row of studio apartments behind the little ceasars.  It's kinda sketchy but I knew a couple that lived in them years ago.  It seems like the kind of place that would only advertise vacancies with a sign out front.

Other than that basement apartments is probably your only option in Payson.  Maybe talk to some people who live in town.  Stop and buy something from a few shops downtown and talk to the proprietors.  There are a lot of old families in town and people know people and if you're spending money in their shop they'll be happy to help.  Or talk to the cashiers in the gas stations when they're not busy, especially those working the morning shift, even if they're not local they often chat with the locals, and they may know of something.

"**Overnight spots**

In the south end of the valley both Payson and Santaquin canyons have a number of free camping spots.  

Strawberry has free camping spots, but that may not be close enough depending on what you're looking for.  

[This site](http://freecampsites.net/#!Utah&query=region) suggests that Diamond Fork has free spots once you get past the 12 mile mark.

It also suggests Sandy Beach, which I would not recommend unless you're looking for redneck bonfires.

Going further south (and 15 minutes out of the county) there are free spots at Burraston Ponds and maybe Goshen Canyon as well.

**Day Use** 

This really depends on what you're looking for.  This is nowhere near an inclusive list of places, it's just a quick list of a few places in various categories. 

Easy hikes - Grotto, Battlecreek Falls.  

Bigger hikes - Loafer, Lone Peak, Timp (pay unless you go up the front).  

Mountain Biking trails - Rock Canyon, Benny Creek.  

Rock Climbing - Rock Canyon, AF Canyon (pay), Santaquin Canyon.  

Fishing - Almost any river in the county.  

Boating - Lincoln Beach might still be free to put in, most of the other harbors are pay.  Mona Res.  Salem Pond (non-motorized)

Trail Walks / Biking - Bonneville Shoreline, Murdoch Canal, Jordan River, Provo River

I just noticed that your title specifically mentions hikes, so you probably don't care about some of this stuff, but I typed it out so I'll leave it.

As for hikes specifically, the mountains are covered in trails of varying quality.  Pull up google maps and scout out a few trails that look interesting and explore.  Afaik the only pay section of road in the county is AF canyon to Aspen Grove.  Every other public road you should be able to drive for free.",t2_7qgry,blink_and_youre_dead,0,1407439207.0,0,t1_cjjs299,cjjs299,True,natjbrown,t3_2cugml,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahValley/comments/2cugml/looking_for_recommendations_for_free_campsites/,Looking for recommendations for free campsites and day hikes in Utah County,/r/UtahValley/comments/2cugml/looking_for_recommendations_for_free_campsites/cjjs299/,1,r/UtahValley,0,1
"Dry Canyon, Battlecreek Falls, Squaw Peak, and Rock Canyon are the only ones that I can think of right now that don't have overnight fees. 

Day-use however, there's a bunch along those areas mentioned above that are really nice to hike, BBQ at, play frisbee, or ride bikes at. We like Sundance (hike from the bottom!), Dry Canyon, Bridal Veil, Big Springs, Timpanogos Park, Canyon Glen etc (along Provo Canyon). Indian Springs above Battle Creek is something to hike and go see, and I have a book on how to climb Timp from any angle from Michael Kelsey (not that I've tried it) so technically climbing it from the Utah Valley side top to bottom in one day would be free.

If you had to pay, I'd look into Diamond Fork (Fifth Water Hot Springs), Big Springs for overnight, Timpanooke side of Timp, Maple Peak (Whiting Campground), and then Dry Canyon (free). I also really like Stewart Falls, and up to the 2nd large waterfall along the Aspen Grove trail to Timpanogos (or hike all the way to Emerald Lake and back).

Hope some of those ideas help. If you have a National Park year pass that helps us get by when we go to American Fork Canyon or Aspen Grove. We also have Sundance ski passes and hike / mtn bike there in the Summer months by riding the lift half way up (but I've hiked many times from the bottom and it's free - but no camping allowed).

"I'm down for anything that my schedule permits. We could also see if there are any good local bands playing and hit up one of them. The three bars on center are (in order of distance from the 15) city limits, a rather terrible, dirty dive, the Madison, either hanging with the bros or the hicks, and ABG's, my preference of the three.

The Madison has a few pool tables,  but last time I was there, they were swallowing cue balls instead of returning them. There's also almost always a cover fee. The lower two floors are for the hip hop/house crowd, the upper two are the country section with a mechanical bull and a karaoke room. 

City limits takes ""hole in the wall"" to a new low. From what I've seen, it's where all the old homeless tweakers spend their panhandling money. If someone has used the bathrooms in the last hour, you'll know... They've got two pool tables in a pretty small area, so it gets crowded to play. 

ABG's is a cool little place. There's only a cover if a band's playing, two pool tables that actually work, a jukebox, and a TV that shows sports. The food is pretty good for bar grub, and they have a solid beer selection. Most of the staff is really friendly, a few are a little quiet and can come off as rude if you don't get to know them. The problems there are that the tables can get filled and then you've got a line of quarters waiting to play, and if there's a show the place is packed and the bar gets a good sized line.

There are also some really awesome ethnic food choices in provo, ie Indian, Chinese hot pot, vietnamese, sushi, Mexican, etc.",t2_9noqa,Kavemann,0,1398544296.0,0,t1_ch2sb2y,ch2sb2y,True,Detached09,t3_23zhl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahValley/comments/23zhl7/global_reddit_meetup_day_v_has_been_set_for_june/,"Global Reddit Meetup Day V has been set for June 14, 2014.

"Actually yes.
We paid ~$200 back in early December, and had it since then.

We use a belkin wireless n router that we got online for 40$ and average between 8mbps down and 20mbps down, and 5-10mbps to 20mbps up.

The 30mbps has been hit on offpeak times, but overall I won't complain about the speed.

I've had problems since the beginning with random packet loss, it seems one out of every 15 packets or so drops, which gives you pockets of lag in games. They've attributed this to my router, so I tested one from work, a Linksys e2500, and there was no difference whatsoever.
Now, I'm using a wireless N USB card, which I suppose 'could' account for the packet loss, except my wife also gets it, and is using a 4ft cat5 cable I made.

Also, they block torrents, all of them. I understand why, but considering Blizzard uses torrents when updating their games (WoW for the wife, Diablo3 for me) and caused a major problem until I used my VPN and found an alternative solution.

Also, my domain seems to be on and off their block list.. and I have yet to find out why.. I say that because again, VPN to a foreign country and it loads up, sites like http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/ show it up just fine, and my wife can't access it while I'm on it via the VPN.

Truth be told, for a broke college student, or for folks that surf the web, it's fantastic.

For hardcore gamers, it's terrible.

* Keep & Exchange Books in Springville is a small used bookstore with a decent selection. You can trade in a book and pay $1 to get another. You can call in for inventory inquiries.
