Haha your comments about the freight trains are so true! We live on the north of Main and thankfully it isn’t too loud near us. I would hate to be within 1-2 blocks of that freight line.

"We just moved to Lansdale ourselves and bought a rowhome. So far we’ve really been enjoying it. We live closer to the train station and the vibe is definitely rougher than I’m used to in the suburbs, but is nowhere near feeling dangerous or uncomfortable as I’ve felt in some areas of Philly and Norristown. It’s solidly working class/middle class near the center of town and gets more upper middle class the further out you get. 

For us, it’s been a happy compromise of finding an affordable home (rare these days), a walkable downtown, a nearby Septa station, good schools, and a place that’s close to shopping. We have everything we need within a 10 minute walk or drive and it’s really great.

"The entire area is pretty safe and nice. I grew up in Lansdale and Towamencin. There are definitely some more affluent areas surrounding the borough, and the houses will get bigger and newer the further out you go. Depends on what you want but there's easy access to rail lines into the city, both the turnpike and the northeast extension. I'd stay away from the center of town near the train station though, as the freight train STARTS at 12am and doesn't stop until like 4am, and blows the horn all night while crossing the street.

"""Lansdale"" encompasses different things. There's the Borough of Lansdale, and then there are places that use Lansdale as a postal location. For example, we moved to Lansdale in 2007, but we're in Upper Gwynedd Township, not the Borough, but if people ask, I still say Lansdale.

Upper Gwynedd township and places like Lower Gwynedd, Towamencin and Hatfield township all seem pretty nice, and some would be ""Lansdale.""

"I couldn't care less about being down voted. The town hasn't changed enough in the 40+ years I've been a ""part"" of it to warrant me wanting to spend much time here aside from residing, and that's by necessity and convenience. Everything on Main closes at 9 (including First Fridays). Speaking of which, how many barber shops, comic/magic stores and Hispanic grocers does one town need in a half mile stretch? The prime real estate on Walnut facing the train station is a desolate wasteland, the borough does jack shit to ""landscape"" anything other than the municipal building, and even off-peak traffic is a joke due to horribly timed and sequenced lights. Did I mention the roads are shit? There's nothing for kids that don't skate except to ride wheelies (manual, for those in the know) through the aforementioned traffic and the drunks and tweakers are somehow still the face of the town.

"1. Yangtze - Amazing specialties (almost certainly the best Gen. Tso's), got a giant fingernail in the fried rice.  Never ordered there again even though the duck was delicious.  Almost certainly a fluke, but... geez.
2. Golden Chopsticks - No experience. Which is weird.
3. China King - Very generic, solid.  Never had expectations, never been disappointed.  Very reliable and will straight up tell you if they can't/can't do something.
4. China Panda - Slightly worse than China King on normal dishes, but better on the specialties.  About the same on General Tso's.  Less transparent customer service than China King.
5. Mama Thai - For some reason I've only had subpar food and experience here (3-4 tries).  Maybe just bad luck or bad menu choice.  Not really a General Tso's place though.
6. Asian Legend - Actually really, really great.  Not the generic General Tso's fare you're looking for though.
7. Kowloon - Great, pricey, worth it if you actually want Dim Sum.  Honestly, pretty surprising that it's decent Chinese food outside of the city.
8. Abacus - Pricey, small portions.  Significantly better quality than China King and China Panda though.  Not worth it to me, but if you're dieting or care about how nice the broccoli in your gen. tso's is, go off.

Weird shout outs to Oki Sushi and Izu Sushi, of which I think Izu is better... but they're definitely not Gen. Tso's places either.  Oki dece terriyaki.  Umai Sushi is the real premium shit in town.

"Not LGBT, but if it's any solace, there was a rather significant Pro-George Floyd/Pro-BLM protest in town last summer.

We're at least outwardly pro-LGBT and have had/do have LGBT owned businesses that aren't harassed from what I know.  On main street, we had an LGBT owned comic shop (that has a new owner who's very pro-LGBT).  We have a Black Bookstore, which is literally an African-American owned business that sells almost exclusively books catering towards diverse audiences.  Which is pretty close by to the rather beloved vegan mom&pop style restaurant.  All of which are nearby vape shops and tattoo parlors which are very LGBT friendly.

It helps somewhat that our populace is relatively young and has instant access to Philly via the Regional Rail if you just want to sleep here and never hang out.

**That being said**, we're still a PA suburb, so if you're from NYC or LA, you'll find it rather racist/homophobic in general.",t2_61zjc,ShatterZero,0,1633828103.0,0,t1_hg1sk32,hg1sk32,True,lgbt4lansdale,t3_q4xdw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lansdale/comments/q4xdw5/how_lgbtfriendly_is_lansdale/,How LGBT-friendly is Lansdale?,/r/Lansdale/comments/q4xdw5/how_lgbtfriendly_is_lansdale/hg1sk32/,15,r/Lansdale,0,15

"Agree with some of these tips but not all. A lot has changed in the last few years. First Fridays are fun, but seasonal. Couple fun and casual places to eat such as Lansdale Tavern, Well Crafted (outdoor beer garden on weekends), Round Guys, and Stove and Tap. Wisters BBQ is so much more than bbq. A ton of pizza places and everyone has their favorites. Amicis Deli on Broad is great. Main Freeze for ice cream. A bunch of hidden gems like Giulianos Deli are tucked away too. Lots of local shops to check out too- Small Batch Kitchen, Love Obsessed, so many tattoo shops. Umai sushi is top notch and Izu is pretty good too.

"Main Street shuts down at nine pm. Avoid ""the wedge"" area around Walnut and the surrounding neighborhood. Also, the Gulf station on 3rd and Broad can be sketchy af. The town hasn't evolved much in the 35 years since I left so keep your expectations in check. The best part is that it's near major thoroughfares (SEPTA included) to other areas. 

Welcome

Also, mail service sucks. The PO is overloaded and not adequately staffed or mapped (no space to add routes)

"Thank you. So do I!

I actually got done work early so I drove around for an hour in Lansdale just to see if I got lucky and the thief just dumped it somewhere.  

Its especially upsetting to me knowing someone stole something from him that means so much just a few weeks before Christmas.  

It makes me almost hope that whoever took it was someone really in need and not just a chop shop for bikes or a well off teen that was just getting his kicks. Does that make any sense? I've considered, if I got the bike back, buying a bike for the kid who needed it if they were that desperate. 

I'm not one to reward bad behavior,  but it is Christmas. Maybe they need a bike more than my son?

"“There’s absolutely no duty to retreat in one’s home. Your home is your castle. If an uninvited person attempts to come into your home, then you’re presumed to act reasonably if you use lethal deadly force against them.”

Again, at what point do you as a victim discern the intent of an individual who has forced their way into your home, vehicle, or place of business?

The following should shine a brighter light on the matter and it’s straight from the horses mouth.

It is perfectly logical. There have been murders during the rioting and looting by the rioters and looters. There is no debating it. Ignoring that would be unjust to the people who have lost life and property while simply trying to exist and conduct their business. Choosing to fabricate a debate against the notion that people have the right to keep what is theirs (including their own lives) while ignoring the fact that people have been murdered especially in this event specifically requires some very damning mental gymnastics.

"Rioters and looters are distinguishing between thievery and harming individuals less and less as this continues.

"Franks is kinda crap.... New Station is better. Venezia's is way, way better but doesn't always deliver to Lansdale, and there one delivery driver always convienently 'forgets' to bring change. It's worth it to pick it up, however, as it's not far if you take back roads. (https://www.veneziaspizzahatfield.com/)

I'm yet to come across a Chinese delivery place that I really like, so just keep trying different ones until you find one you do. 

As for other Asian food, Amber Asian has good thai food, and they're on main street. Briyani bowl is good Indian. Pho 'n' More in the shopping center by Radnor's is good. BUT! here's the worst kept secret in the area, close to it, on Welsh, on the way to 309, is Assi market. Asians from all over the region go there to grocery shop, so they have excellent produce and the like if you do a lot of Asian inspired cooking. Best of all, they have a little food court, which is all really high quality, fresh Asian food specifically meant for Asian people who know what's up. Their sushi in particular is great, and is a steal. In addition to that, Izu Sushi on main street is also very good, but more pricey, and has other excellent Japanese and Chinese options. 

As for cheesesteaks, forget what everyone else has said. Venezia's makes a great garlic bread cheesesteak, but there's this place a couple of blocks off main street called Giuliano's. It's located here: 429 N Chestnut St, Lansdale, PA 19446. It's very, VERY good. Better than Delassandros.

As for beer, Round Guys is meh, tbh. I want them to be better than they are, but they're really just not very good. I went to a new place, Blue Print brewing last night, and they were atrocious. Lansdale and North Wales just seem to not have good water for brewing beer. 

As for produce, there's produce junction, and you're also pretty damn close to a Wegman's which is hands down the best super market in the area.

"Yes and no. We moved from Dallas TX to far ne Philadelphia about 3 years ago. Moved cross country from a standard 3bd home (which are vastly different from standard homes here ) to a 1bd apt sight unseen. So stressful, lol. But got lucky and it was a great complex while we figured out where to buy. We liked Jersey (to a point) but not the people, it’s not that they’re bad or rude just ....loud. Lol. Delaware was just not convenient enough and Philadelphia proper (which we love) is just too peoplely. So after 2 years of saying what about this town, or that area, we landed here and are quite happy with our choice. So far we’ve tried franks?? pizza and yannis gyros both very tasty, and the meat market rocks too. Now I need a good produce place and Chinese delivery and we’ll be set.

"Ah! that does make it tricky. Most of my friend group was formed through work or college. We'll hang out at Pizza Pub in Hatfield, Blue Dog in Lansdale, or Margarita's in Lansdale but it's not like they are great places for meeting new people, they are just convenient locations for hanging out with people you already know. I imagine if you think about it, you'll realize that's true of most of your hangout spots back in Orlando. So what you need is something that will actually get you in repeated contact with the same new individuals.

"Jumping Jacks (""the bouncy castle"") is a great time for a small kid; just head in and let him/her go wild.  Great way to let your kid burn off a lot of energy.

If he's/she's a bit older, there's Rebounderz - (former supermarket filled with trampolines).  And that's a lot of fun for the adults, too.

The Montgomery Mall has a great little playground, as well.  There's also the ""castle park"", as my son calls it, at Sumneytown and Parkside Place, the ""train park"" (Whistle-stop park) at Walnut and County Line, etc.  A lot of good playgrounds; google around.

Another good place is Freddy Hill Farms - Jack always has a good time with mini-golf and ice cream.  When he gets a bit older, we'll try the driving range and/or batting cages.  Merrymead farms is nice, too - also good ice cream, but we usually only go there for events (like the Halloween corn maze they did this year, which was pretty damned epic).

Another thing Jack's recently been (ahem) stable enough for is movies - and Frank's Theater in the complex at North Wales and Horsham is a great, low-key theater (but not so low-key you stick to the floor).

The Borough also does a lot of programs for kids.  Jack just finished with Hummingbirds soccer, which was as adorable as it was good for him (he learned a lot about how to work through frustration - a goddamned miracle for a 4-year-old, if you ask me).  Check out some of their other [youth programs](http://www.lansdale.org/209/Youth).

During the summer, there's the Farmer's Market, which is excellently run, and has some consistently awesome comestables.  Seems to change location annually, though.

As for housing, the choices are pretty diverse.  Note that my pricing information is about 5 years out of date (that's when we bought this place).  but here's what I remember: 

Our area (8th and Moyer) is middling, with a good amount of diversity, reasonable prices ($180k range), and low walkability.  The half-mile or so radius around 5th & Walnut is a fantastic area, but the prices are a little higher ($190k range).  The strip surrounding Derstine has some really great houses - and is a block from Main - but they tend to be more in the $225k range.  Just a little to the north of us is some lower cost stuff ($160k range).  Smaller houses, but great people there, and a playground integrated into the community.  If there's anything available in or around Wedgewood Estates, I'd strongly recommend snapping it up for a new, smaller family.  Their playground is walkable from us, so we take advantage of that a lot.

All-in-all, I'd definitely recommend joining us here; it's a great little town.  Or Hatfield, which is just across Cowpath Rd.  Or North Wales, which just just to the south on Church Rd.  The whole area is just a really great place to be right now.",t2_3ttlh,Fordiman,0,1478271075.0,0,t1_d9lj2k4,d9lj2k4,True,[deleted],t3_59jast,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lansdale/comments/59jast/possibly_moving_to_the_area_to_accept_a_new_job/,Possibly moving to the area to accept a new job in Lansdale.

"Last year it was $90/year, on my current ~$3,600/year bill; inflation 2014-2015 would have raised it by $4.27 - so, a net loss of $85.73 there.  This one's another $25/year; inflation 2015-2016 added $68.67 - so a net gain of $43.67.

Honestly, though, we're talking ~2.5% and ~0.7% increases over the previous years (1.97% in '15, 2.02% in '16 and now, 2.036% in '17), respectively - to pay for keeping up the quality of this outstanding Borough.

"Having recently looked for homes on the market in Lansdale, twins are starting around $230s these days. It all depends on the condition though. A modernized twin just sold in the West Ward for over $300k, while a larger incredibly out dated project twin, located down the road, sold for $225K. The West Ward is considered the most desirable section based on price however. Singles in the West Ward, with yards at least, rarely come up for sale for instance.

You (u/soldado387) may want to look at the numbered streets.  We had been looking for some time and finally purchased. Having observed the market in the borough over a few years, your best bet is to wait until the spring if possible - although 2016 was a bit of a dry market. There are a few homes, that may be for sale now with lower prices, but of course the market always shrinks towards the holidays.

"$175k will get you into a twin (a two house townhouse, 3 BR, 1.5 BA, ~1500 sq ft per unit) in/near Lansdale but probably not a detached home.  Those start around $230k.  You'd have to look about 45 minutes north along I-475 (like Pennsburg or Red Hill) to find a detached for less than $200k.

Commuting in the Lansdale area can be slow due to the lack of bypasses or limited access highways.  Only two such roads pass through upper Montgomery county (I-476 and PA-309).  Going 10 miles usually takes over 30 minutes, which can double during rush hour.  It takes an hour to get into Philly by train from Lansdale, $9 each way, no transfers needed.

"I honestly never thought I'd be saying this as I'm generally pretty liberal, but the solution to Lansdale's problems isn't going to come from government grants or spending. The issue is a massive discrepancy in rent prices and demand. Rent is just too high for the buildings on Main St. I don't know who is making the decisions about what they're charging, but empty storefronts are in no way better than having to lower rates. And now there are SO many empty ones, there's going to be options for any businesses that want to move in. 

Maybe I really just don't understand it, but how can what was supposed to be Lansdale's best restaurant, Shell.Fish.Sue be forced to close in one building, while right across the street is a MAGIC SHOP? How can the same street force out the only upscale-ish, non-brewery bar in the town, yet support TWO absolutely garbage comic book shops? We've got a god damn theater makeup store, but we can't support ONE independent coffee shop? A freakin cobbler and a coin shop, but no but no place to sit down and eat good, non specialty food?

"The former Molly Maguire’s Irish Pub in Lansdale might soon have a new look, a new menu, and a new chef.

“The decor will definitely change to be kind of a lighter, more of a rustic, more modern feel. We’re going for an American, rustic feel,” said Matt Moyer, who is in the process of acquiring via bankruptcy and reworking the former pub.

“It’ll be very American, very much like back woods America — the menu proposals we’ve seen and the chef partners we’ll have are phenomenal,” he said.

Moyer is originally from Glenside, and is a partner with HFA Bridge, a New York-based restaurant accounting firm which deals with real estate groups to rehabilitate restaurants — and is “very excited to be doing business closer to home.”

Located at 329 W. Main St. on the northeast corner of Main and Wood streets, the former Molly Maguire’s building fits that description: it housed real estate offices until 2010, when it was sold to the owners of Molly Maguire’s. That sale took place in April 2010, according to Reporter archives and Montgomery County property records, and the restaurant operated there from July 2010 until January 2015, when the restaurant closed its doors on the heels of a bankruptcy declaration last summer.

Moyer said he met countless local residents — and several borough officials — at last month’s borough Beer Tasting Festival, and heard nothing but support for the idea.

“We love Lansdale, and we think we can have a big impact there. We met a lot of people at the Beer Fest, did our homework, and it just seemed like a great marriage, a great location,” he said.

Internal renovations should only take two to three months, according to Moyer, but the timeline will largely be dictated by the state Liquor Control Board and how quickly the liquor license for the restaurant is processed and approved.

“We’re very excited to continue to finalize the details on the project, and hopefully open this fall for Lansdale,” he said.

As of Friday afternoon county property records listed the 2010 sale as the most recent transaction. The bankruptcy process is still underway, Moyer said, and as the highest bidder he’s “continuing to follow the steps of the bankruptcy process.”

Details are still being finalized as to the chef and menu, and Moyer says he hopes to create a new local destination.

“We’re getting the feeling that a lot of people are there to support us, and are excited about the fact that we bought it in bankruptcy, and the concept we’re putting in. It’ll be phenomenal food, phenomenal craft beer, but at approachable prices and approachable from a culinary standpoint,” Moyer said.

Borough Mayor Andy Szekely said news of a new business in the former Molly’s building would be “nice news” for the borough — “there are a few open properties on that block of Main Street, and it’d be nice to get another restaurant on that block to help trigger our downtown revitalization.”",t2_3cyeq,jdr,0,1437917032.0,0,t1_ctgmyno,ctgmyno,False,jdr,t3_3elq9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lansdale/comments/3elq9h/new_identity_planned_for_former_molly_maguires_in/,New identity planned for former Molly Maguire's in Lansdale,/r/Lansdale/comments/3elq9h/new_identity_planned_for_former_molly_maguires_in/ctgmyno/,1,r/Lansdale,0,1

Either that or just start promoting that we have more hair and nail stores per square mile.  Then more will open and we can get into the Guinness book of world records.  Just think of the tourism dollars we could bring in.

"> How's commuting i.e. traffic, ease of roads?

Like u/hive_worker stated, depending on where you go, will depend on the type of rush hour your experience.  Going towards King of Prussia or Philadelphia, you might need to plan for a slow commute.
Going towards Doylestown, Quakertown, Allentown and the rush hour might be a little lighter but your drive might be longer.
Regarding the quality of the roads.  Right now they are pretty bad, at least in my commute, due to pothole season.  Except for pothole season, the roads are pretty good.    

> Are there good restaurants/shopping nearby?

I really like the smoke house tavern.  Which is right in the Station Square complex.  You are also very close to Prisim, which is nice local brewery.  Main street in Lansdale has some nice restaurants as well.  There are many pizza places, a Sushi place, Gyro, Seafood, Italian, another Brewery, two sports bars, a local coffee house, and ice cream and water ice places.  The Montgomery Mall is nearby, Wegmans, Acme, Giant, Target, Best Buy, Old Navy, Home Depot, Lowes, etc... are within a 15-25 minute drive (depending on traffic).  

You are also near the Pennbrook train station, which can take you either into Doylestown or Philadelphia.

Depends where you're commuting to. Traffic can get bad in rush hour. Especially where you will live because it's right next to a gigantic series of Merck offices/plants.  But it's not terrible and weekends/afternoons it's pretty light. 

> Are there good restaurants/shopping nearby? 

Yes... depends what you're looking for. Montgomeryville area is a 5 minute drive and has tons of chain stores and restaurants, and a mall. If you want more local/small restaurants just search around. Lansdale does have a walkable main street with a few places to check out. So does North Wales, which you are also close to.

"Hello.  

 I thought the /r/lansdale subreddit might be a good place to post about what we are doing here (NTN).

My colleague, Shannon and I, are turning Lansdale Applebee's into a music venue on Saturday Nights.  

It's akin to an open mic night, but with a little more order...
We would like to make sure anyone who performs would be family friendly, of course.

Thank you for responding to my post.  I have always found Reddit to be a great tool in a lot of ways (as well as a major distraction at times, ha!)

This is definitely not spam, but rather, raising awareness for a demographic in our area that has musical talent and needs a medium through which to express it.

I'd appreciate your support, modmania.  What do you think about NTN?

"Hello Modmania,

I'm a resident of Lansdale and I work at Applebee's.
I recently presented my managers with the idea of an open mic night event on Saturday nights to both, increase sales for the restaurant and showcase the hidden talents and gems of our community.  

I'm not a spokesperson for Applebee's, I just work there and am passionate about music.  

If we could use /r/lansdale as a medium through which which talented musicians in our community could connect, I think this subreddit could vastly improve.  

The mission of any subreddit is to strengthen a particular community.  Our community happens to be Lansdale.
Music is a universal treasure, and I believe that if the subscribers to 
/r/lansdale who have musical talent are approached or find interest in performing, Reddit would be the perfect venue to help the community of musicians connect.

Thanks!

"Applebee's in Lansdale is proud to present NTN on Saturday nights from 9-11.!Christopher, myself and Shannon T are on the ground floor with this weekly attraction.

We are looking for performers who would be interested in showcasing the talent of our community.

Both Shannon and I are just a little worried about bookin the first few weeks, but any interested performers, whether playing guitar or piano and even Ambient EDM music are all fair game.

The whole idea with NTN (neighborhood tune night) is to strengthen our community.

There are lots of musicians in the area and a place like Applebee's in lansdale 2333 welsh Rd (on Ralph's corner) would be the perfect venue for talented performers to showcase their abilities.my partner Shannon and I are scrambling to have quality acts for the first week (May 3rf, Saturday from. 9-11pm.

The consolation for performers will probably consist of a free appetizer or a coupon for $6.50 off an entree. Until NTN takes off the ground we may not have much in the way of cash payment, but any talented performers are more than welcome and would be very be very much appreciated.  

If interested, please send us an email at applebeesntn@gmail.com. We are cutting close to the first show on May 3rd

We are open to all kinds of performances genres, and if you are a musician in the Lansdale/Hatfield area we are looking for you.

Neighborhood Tune Night (or NTN for short) has a lot of potential to get your original music off the ground and gain a following in our community and showcase any hidden gems. We are very excited to see what kind of turnout we will receive.

So please don't be shy! Applebee's  has strong community values and we need musicians from the area to showcase their talents!
 
If you are even the slightest bit interested, please check out the Facebook.com/applebeeslansdaleNTN and show us what you've got. It would be an absolute delight.

We are looking forward to booking performers for the first week and if you have talent of any capacity please get in contact with us via applebeesntn@gmail.com or fell free to call me at 717 385 4155 to talk more about booking.

This event is all about strengthening our community and there is no better place than a family restaraunt like applebees. Our small suburban town has many a diamond in the rough.

Once again, I am - Christopher a. And I am very excited to see the diamonds I. The rough in our community!

Thanks so much - Christopher S.

"From the other post:

I went to get something from my car tonight and when I walked outside I was greeted by a friendly, calico (orange and black) cat. She's fairly small, meows quite a bit, and looks fairly well-groomed so I'm guessing she belongs to someone and I'd like to reunite her with her owner or owners. I know if she were my cat, I'd be heartbroken if she were lost.

We found her in the alley between the first blocks of east 2nd and 3rd St. in Lansdale. We haven't had a chance to check for microchipping yet, as the local vets are currently closed. From the looks of their websites, most, if not all, also don't do non-emergency services like microchip identification on Sundays, so we probably won't be able to get her checked out until Monday morning.

Anyway, she's a wonderful little cat and I'd really like to see her get to her rightful home. If you think she's yours, please let me know and describe her a little better, send me a picture that includes her facial markings, or both.

Thank you for your help in getting this little calico home.",t2_461lp,rxninja,0,1391905618.0,0,t1_cfajp6y,cfajp6y,True,rxninja,t3_1xe9fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lansdale/comments/1xe9fv/lost_found_found_calico_cat_in_lansdale_xpost/,[Lost & Found] Found calico cat in Lansdale (x-post /r/Philadelphia),/r/Lansdale/comments/1xe9fv/lost_found_found_calico_cat_in_lansdale_xpost/cfajp6y/,1,r/Lansdale,0,1
