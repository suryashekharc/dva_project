"My mom claimed that when my parents were first dating (early 70s) it was originally northern lights bowling alley and then at some point they built the bowling alley I remember up on top of the hill that later was the original casino.

I do think that _______ wonderland is the correct name. This all came about because my kids had a birthday party at our roller rink in Wisconsin and it brought back memories. I kind of wish I was older when our roller rink was around, thinking back now it seemed like they had a pretty cool bar and could have been a fun place to go out to.

"It was reported to the police early on and they took it to where they could. It was dropped criminally due to an ""uncooperative victim."" At that point it becomes an internal matter.

It sucks for everyone involved (that didn't do anything wrong. It the accusations are true then clearly someone did do wrong). Fast resolutions are the best case scenario, but they're rarely the correct scenario. From an HR standpoint the school really can't say anything publicly until the audit / investigation is completed, and it's being done by a respected third party. False accusations can destroy an innocent person, and incomplete accusations can let a guilty person walk free and repeat what they've done elsewhere.

Supporting the band program I feel is fully correct. It's been an institution and fantastic experience for a lot of students. Supporting the instructors, however, may be best to hold off on until the investigation is complete. Just because someone did great in the past doesn't mean they should be absolved from their crimes.

The shit part about any situation like this is the waiting and uncertainty. If what allegedly happened took place publicly with lots of witnesses then parts of the process can move fast, but if it's behind the scenes then even publicly finding out can take time.",t2_4m0ak,fireturn,0,1644421177.0,0,t1_hw8i5mz,hw8i5mz,False,bakayaro8675309,t3_soa8up,https://www.reddit.com/r/petoskey/comments/soa8up/httpswwwpetoskeynewscompicturegallerynews20220207d/,https://www.petoskeynews.com/picture-gallery/news/2022/02/07/demonstration-shows-support-petoskey-band-program-teachers/6694077001/,/r/petoskey/comments/soa8up/httpswwwpetoskeynewscompicturegallerynews20220207d/hw8i5mz/,4,r/petoskey,0,4

I wish there was an easy way to solve the issue, and the school has been dragging it out WAY too long. I get that they can't accuse anyone without legal ramifications, and due to the nature of the actions already taken there's no privacy in regards to the parties involved.

The school can't come out and say ""XX happened"" because legally they'd be accusing a person, even without naming them.

"My husband (35) and I (36) moved here 3 years ago.

"I would say getting your housing settled first is imperative. It was $60-$80 to get on the waiting lists (no guaranteed apt, just the waiting list) for various apartments in the area and actually securing an apartment took about 4 months. It was very expensive and there were not a lot of options. Also been looking at non rentals but it's incredibly difficult trying to buy vs people who are cash buying homes at ridiculously inflated prices. Very few options under $200,000, almost all are sold within moments. Not only are houses expensive, but the components to make them have also inflated vastly. It's very difficult to buy things like fridges and water heaters, along with base material like lumber. Many contractors have long wait times, and they tell you the price of components varies so rapidly that whatever price they give you is only good for a day or two. You absolutely must establish how you are going to reside before you move.",t2_2ngrv7iw,Reasonable-Contract9,0,1641430119.0,0,t1_hrfis5t,hrfis5t,True,lunarttrash,t3_rom3j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/petoskey/comments/rom3j5/moving_to_petoskey/,Moving to Petoskey,/r/petoskey/comments/rom3j5/moving_to_petoskey/hrfis5t/,1,r/petoskey,0,1
"I'm not sure what you constitute is years but I've lived here my whole life. So I can tell you that most of what you say is wrong. Yep those three sites that you talk about that are vacant are vacant but most of the rest of downtown Petoskey is not. And unfortunately due to covid there has been some businesses that had to shut down just like all over the United States. And I'm not sure why you consider the locals hostile did you think maybe it's just towards you.  And I can show you some schedules of people that are working a hell of a lot harder than most. And yes when tourists do come here they do get kind of entitled and snotty but that happens everywhere in every tourist town. And for what you call it being a ghost town it's been pretty packed here this summer. And the past 2 years has been pretty bad but that's due to covid and everybody's hurting not just here. You moved to a small town there's not going to be more than one of the same business. Any smart business owner knows you're not going to make money if somebody already has that same business opened already especially in a small town. I'm not sure what you're expecting out of Petoskey but it sounds like what you're actually looking for is a town like traverse City where it's bigger but still a tourist town and you still get the small town feeling. But you're going to get those same tourists that you don't like. Petoskey is a great town. Right now every town is having a hard time unfortunately our little gem is going through that too. And for the ""chunks of Petoskey are literally falling in the bay"" it's called the shoreline erosion and it's happening to all of Michigan. We can't help that it's not something that the locals of Petoskey have done. So you are pointing out few of the bad things. But most of the things that you are pointing out are things that people have no control over.

"My advice: don’t move to Petoskey.  Petoskey locals are very hostile to people who didn’t grow up there.  The rich retirees are hostile to younger people because they want the area to function as a retirement community and they don’t want to be around kids or “millennials” (anyone under 50). Lots of racism, very conservative politics.  

Customer service is non-existent, because there’s usually not more than 1-2 of any kind of business.  Nobody works harder than they absolutely have to, and/or don’t have the capacity to do their job.  That’s annoying when you’re dealing with Burger King, and terrifying when you’re dealing with a pediatrician. The tourists are rude to the workers all summer, so the workers take it out on the locals the rest of the year.  The downtown shopping area is turning into a ghost town, because the guy who owns most of the buildings makes more money from vacant building tax breaks than he does from renters.  Chunks of Petoskey are literally falling into the bay, possibly in an attempt by God to erase his mistake.

"There's also a street called Emmett Street right in town Petoskey and people in town call it ""the ghetto of Petoskey"" but it's nothing like what anybody is thinking of. The house might be a little more on the rundown side but the apartments and the rent is going to be a little bit more cheaper. We also have what is called subsidized apartment complexes where you have to make at least $20,000 a year in order to be able to afford to live there. And they will actually ask you if you make that much. There is also an apartment complex called traverse woods that is income based also the ones behind them that is called Lafayette apartments that are on the cheaper side for this town. But there are a few places that are quite expensive like a Bear Creek they're pretty expensive more so than I think they're worth.

"I think everyone should read the following excerpt in particular, and realize that very soon we're gonna run out of healthcare workers. The entire system is in a freefall right now, and it's going to get worse before it gets better.

My wife's a nurse, and turned down a job making $6k/wk because it's been too much for too long. She tried being a traveler ($90/hr) at Macomb, and left after her first shift because they're going 12:1 on ICU patient ratios. Safe is 2:1. There's a point where the risk of your patient dying because you're in a different room coding a different patient isn't worth losing your license for.

Shit's bad yo. Do everything you can to stay out of hospitals right now. 

I mean, the [videos are sometimes funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5tgNPOdKGM), but also [admins aren't doing much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVp7i6Qf9T8), and without more workers, can't really do much.

At Sparrow Hospital, administrators are generating creative ways to incentivize and motivate nurses. It just ended a program to reward those who volunteered for an extra shift a week for eight weeks with $10,000.

Concerns persist. “I worry about the new nurse who’s never worked in a hospital before and this is their experience,” said Brown, of Sparrow. “And I worry about the experienced nurse who feels like this isn’t what they are used to, and they don’t want to do this anymore. So, I worry about the profession in general.”

Critical care providers have experienced “quite a bit of stress,” Schult said.

“So we know that our teams are struggling with some, I don’t mean to be dramatic, but (post-traumatic stress disorder) from the number of patients that they’ve had to care for, and not survive.”

They work for hours in an N-95 mask, a face shield and extra layers of protection. “And so that adds another strain.”

The market is driving nurses to travel positions, where they are paid double or triple what they make in a hospital system, she said. “And that leaves us uncovered.”",t2_16r1kk,MiataCory,0,1639060387.0,0,t1_hnusry4,hnusry4,True,c0viDOMME,t3_rby1mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/petoskey/comments/rby1mq/at_mcclaren_northern_michigan_in_petoskey_for_the/,"At McClaren Northern Michigan in Petoskey, for the first time in known history, the hospital had to decline more patient requests than it has accepted, seeing appeals for beds from as far as Kansas, said Shari Schult, vice president of operations.",/r/petoskey/comments/rby1mq/at_mcclaren_northern_michigan_in_petoskey_for_the/hnusry4/,2,r/petoskey,0,2

>The market is driving nurses to travel positions, where they are paid double or triple what they make in a hospital system, she said. “And that leaves us uncovered.”

>The McLaren Petoskey hospital has 202 beds, but hospital capacity is less about space and more about availability of caregivers. They are stretched with about 113 to 150 patients.

>Administrators do what is possible to keep the patient-staff ratios safe, but they are probably seeing a much heavier workload, Schult said. Burnout leads to exodus. Thousands have left the field.

>The Petoskey hospital, situated in a city of about 5,900, does not typically experience a lot of death.

>In November, there were 14 deaths from COVID-19 alone. In October, there were 16. In August, the hospital saw four.

>“So when you’re looking at these numbers, and the same care providers are taking care of these patients day in, day out. They have seen a lot of deaths,” Schult said.

">Speak with hospital administrators and doctors across the state, and trends quickly emerge.

>There are record numbers of COVID-19 patients filling their units.

>Critical or intensive care units are necessarily expanding; it is difficult to find places for people in need of advanced or long-term care; and staffs are stretched, discouraged and sometimes overwhelmed by a wave even more taxing than those that preceded it. Some have left all together, exacerbating shortages that predate COVID-19.

>The crisis isn’t unique to one hospital or one region. It is everywhere.

>At McClaren Northern Michigan in Petoskey, for the first time in known history, the hospital had to decline more patient requests than it has accepted, seeing appeals for beds from as far as Kansas, said Shari Schult, vice president of operations.

>At Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, it is not uncommon for some COVID-19 patients to be at the hospital for 10, 14 or 18 days, longer than most stay for heart surgery, limiting flow through the hospital.

>Late last month, staff at tiny McKenzie Hospital in Sandusky made 35 or more calls on behalf of one dying patient in need of intensive care that no hospital in Michigan’s thumb can provide. It took two days to finally find him a place to go, in metro Detroit.

>In the weeks since, it has gotten worse, Dr. Mark Hamed, emergency department director at McKenzie and medical director for several counties in the thumb and northeast Michigan, said Tuesday. “We are calling, literally, 35 to 40 hospitals, in Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania.”

>Dr. Darryl Elmouchi, president of Spectrum Health West Michigan, was recently doing rounds in an area that has not traditionally been an intensive care unit. His lasting impression? Tears. “Tears from our team members who just have been burning the midnight oil seeing so much death, taking on extra shifts. And then honestly, the last time I rounded, tears from a family member that was about to lose a loved one, and I believe that person was far younger than I am.”

>This week, the state hit a record, topping one set in the spring 2020 and documenting the most total COVID-19 hospitalizations since the start of the pandemic. Michigan, worst in the country, was averaging about 440 hospitalizations per 1 million people for the last seven days. During previous peaks, in spring 2021 and December 2020, the average was about 420, according the University of Michigan’s MI Safe Start Map, last updated Tuesday. The incline, steeper in months past, has been more gradual, increasing since summer.

>As of Monday, state hospitals were treating 4,585 adult and 51 child patients with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, according to state health department data. This included 1,007 people in ICUs and 618 on ventilators.

>The number of people hospitalized with both confirmed and suspected cases has increased about 101% since the beginning of November, when hospitals were seeing 2,249 adult and 56 child patients, including 578 patients in ICUs and 289 on ventilators.

>Most of these patients are unvaccinated – about 76% of the total, 87% of those in ICUs and 88% of people on ventilators, according to data released last week by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Michigan Health and Hospital Association. Those who are vaccinated with COVID-19 usually have other health conditions and are older, doctors said.

>Only 1% of vaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at Henry Ford Health System, based in Detroit, are without a medical comorbidity and they are elderly, Dr. Adnan Munkarah, executive vice president and chief clinical officer, said on a Friday call with reporters. About 11% of the unvaccinated population have no comorbid conditions and they are 10 to 15 years younger than the vaccinated patients, he said.

>Henry Ford Health System, which operates five Michigan hospitals, was treating 420 COVID-19 patients, as of Friday, and another 30 patients with COVID-19 were waiting to be accepted. This was a more than 20% increase from Nov. 22 and slightly below what the health system was seeing in December 2020, when there were 499 COVID-19 patients, Munkarah told reporters. Henry Ford Macomb Hospital in Clinton Township was seeing the highest number of COVID-19 patients with 135.

>Demands on caregivers are greater than during past swells. Patients overall are sicker, at least in part because many avoided care early in the pandemic. And COVID patients are staying longer because treatments have improved, and it is difficult to find alternative places for them to go – longer- or short-term nursing or rehabilitation facilities don’t have beds either, doctors and administrators said.

>Amy Brown, chief nursing officer at Sparrow Hospital, said caregivers are feeling “defeated.”

>“The feeling a year ago was, many people were very hopeful thinking that we are going into the new year with a vaccine and then to be back at this spot, especially near the holidays, is just disheartening,” Brown said.

>The percentage of positive tests -- at an unprecedented 20% statewide -- and the seven-day average of new, reported coronavirus cases in Michigan have reached pandemic highs in the last month. Experts blame cold weather, forcing people indoors, waning immunity, lax safety precautions and too-low vaccination rates. About 56% of the eligible population, recently expanded to include children 5 to 11, is fully vaccinated in Michigan.

>As of Monday, Sparrow had broken its pandemic record with 130 COVID-19 patients. Twenty-five were in critical care.

>The hospital has had to scale back on surgeries to reallocate staff. Procedures are being delayed.

>Other hospitals are reporting the same. In about two weeks, University of Michigan Health-West in Wyoming, near Grand Rapids, had cancelled or delayed more than 70 procedures, Dr. Peter Hahn, president and CEO, said Friday.

>There is constant shuffling and evaluation to handle those with most urgent or life-threatening needs. People with lesser concerns might wait for several hours in emergency departments.

>Munson Healthcare based in Traverse City had 146 COVID patients as of Tuesday. This surpasses its peak recorded last week. It remains on the highest pandemic level status. Like many others, the hospital system is “very red,” the chief medical officer said in an update this week.

>“I think everyone is just really tired at this point. It’s just trying to figure out how to staff bed and keep services open is a daily puzzle we have to put together,” said Dianne Michalek, chief marketing and communications officer, but she was quick to add: “We are doing a great job at it.”

>Munson’s “safety valve” has always been the downstate hospitals, such as Spectrum Health based in Grand Rapids, Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor and Beaumont Health based in Southfield. “And as we see those hospitals reaching higher capacities, it does cause use concern because we rely on each other to transfer patients when one facility gets full.”

>In the last month and a half, Spectrum had received 700 calls to accept from outlying Michigan hospitals with patients in need of higher levels of care, Elmouchi said, and Spectrum cannot take them. “Historically, we accept all of those patients, and that is not just here. That’s happening all across the state.”

>Spectrum West Michigan, which saw its most-ever number of COVID-19 patients last week with more than 450, had 126 ICU patients. “This is beyond capacity,” Elmouchi said. And the numbers keep rising.

>Schult of McLaren in Petoskey said the hospital fields requests from places and people who never before asked McLaren to take patients. “We’ve had families call. It’s not even a physician-to-physician request… ‘Will you take my loved one?’”

>An emergency transfer to the Detroit area might take a week and a half, McLaren learned in the last few months.

>“Yes, there are times that we too have to hold patients that probably aren’t the right patient to be here,” Schult said.

>“If there’s no place for them to go, they’re getting the best care that they can from us.”

>To help alleviate the strain, federal assistance has arrived. Two teams of about 20 doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists are now helping at Beaumont Hospital in Dearborn, Covenant HealthCare in Saginaw and Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids.

>Additionally, the John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit has opened ten beds for civilians. These include five in acute medicine and five in intensive care, a spokesperson wrote in an email. The Detroit VA also opened beds in April 2020 for patient transfers from community medical systems.

>There is no effect on veteran care, Elliott Sprehe wrote in an email. “Detroit VA has managed to stay ahead or atop COVID surges through calculated plans based on supportive data that follow specific operational protocols.”

>There is probably not a hospital in the state that wouldn’t qualify for aid, said Bob Riney, president, healthcare operations and chief operating officer at Henry Ford Health System. Henry Ford was not yet at a point that it would solicit assistance. “We are very close,” Riney told reporters.

"Hi, can you stop engaging in targeted harassment? It's against the sitewide rules of reddit.

Ways you're violating reddit's sitewide rules:

> Reddit is a place for conversation, and in that context, we define this behavior as anything that works to shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse, online or off.

^ You're repeatedly calling for me to be banned in numerous posts I make in different subs

> Depending on the context, this can take on a range of forms, from directing unwanted invective at someone to following them from subreddit to subreddit

^ You're following me from sub to sub with harassing messages.

"I moved here from Georgia six years ago, I feel your pain. Glad to see a fellow southerner around here. Feel free to friend me if you'd like someone to commiserate with. I'm Samara Hunt on Facebook.

I don't know about tire studs. I don't use those or chains. I just try not to brake real hard, and I don't leave town if I can help it. The highways outside town are windswept sheets of ice that roll for miles upon miles. If you leave town, drive something heavy with a low profile and four wheel drive.

No black flies or mosquitoes, but there are a lot of midges, so if you ride in anything without a roof and windshield, wear goggles and a mask or your diet is gonna have a lot more protein in it.

No moose. Never seen a moose this far south. Deer are rampant though, so watch out at night.

I haven't seen any dirt roads in my time here, but there's a pretty sharp distinction between standing-on-the-moon cold and ten-feet-from-the-sun hot here, and the winters here are dry as a bone, so I haven't seen much of a ""mud season"".",t2_bni9g,AuthorSAHunt,0,1631277064.0,0,t1_hcayo4w,hcayo4w,True,iamicanseeformiles,t3_plb6e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/petoskey/comments/plb6e4/moving_to_area_questions/,Moving to area questions,/r/petoskey/comments/plb6e4/moving_to_area_questions/hcayo4w/,-2,r/petoskey,0,-2
"1) no studded tires in Michigan, sorry. A good set of winter tires should be sufficient though.

2) black flies and mosquitoes tend to be bigger issues in the U.P. (Upper peninsula) and in boggy areas. Generally the Petoskey area they aren’t a big issue. 

3) we have “seasonal roads” that aren’t maintained by the county in the winter, some of these may be closed if conditions are poor enough. You’ll need an ORV pass if you want to utilize certain 2 tracks. 

4) deer are definitely a concern at dawn and dusk. No moose issues and the elk herd isn’t really in our area. 

Our ski industry is definitely an easy place to get some hours in the winter, you’re probably the perfect fit for part time at Boyne or Nubs.

"I know this post is old now but I just found it and would like to offer my opinion. 

I really understand where you are coming from. I have been as plagued as any other low-income person for housing of any kind, and I'm in my 40's so I can remember when rent wasn't so insane! And yes, it is a problem everywhere now. The ""just move somewhere else/just get a mortgage"" people don't have a grasp on what is realistic for people on a shoestring budget, who never got a meaningful lucky break like paid-for college, a rich uncle, or even a malady-free body. It has sucked 'out there' in the world of cheap apartments since 2008. I remember making about $9/hour in 2001 and renting for about $300/month and thinking that I was 'splurging' on a slightly-bigger apartment than was necessary. 

Decades later, it has all become completely insane. I don't have to tell you. And yeah, the class divide hits you in the face. 

BUT, here's what I want to say; to pick on Bay View, to let it bother you...IDK I think there are just so many better targets for your ire. I grew up in Petoskey. I watched the atrocity that is Bay Harbor go from an old cement plant where teenagers used to four-wheel and drink to what it is today - a tacky, faux 'neighborhood' of cheap excess. Hate on *that*, comrade! Seriously. AT LEAST Bay View is ancient by comparison, and no-one can say that it isn't charming as shit. I mean, just take a walk through there and remember that those people have so much money they would have ripped it all up and built steel-and-glass bullshit or 'luxury' towers with no trees or sidewalks anywhere else in the country, but *Bay View has been preserved*. The houses definitely do not ""rot,"" they have very strict rules of maintenance to keep them in good order. 

Another thing: it's tiny. It's like, *super-small*, and represents so few acres that you just have to say ""Eh, it doesn't matter that much."" 

Both of my parents and my sister and then me all worked for one of the families for a stretch of years in the 90's, maintaining their cottage there. It is one of the most impressive ones. I thought about it a lot, the disparity. Why their family inherited the zillion-dollar property that my family all had to work to maintain. We're atheists, too, if that matters. I guess I 'got over' my resentment for some of the reasons I talked about above; mostly boiling down to *other things are way worse.* 

So, you know...I realize it's just my perspective I'm sharing with you, and it won't be enough to change your mind. Personally I'm still down to eat the rich but Bay View just isn't where I'd start.",t2_zvbwa,Quay-Z,0,1628538148.0,0,t1_h8bnnlr,h8bnnlr,True,[deleted],t3_oex5iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/petoskey/comments/oex5iq/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/petoskey/comments/oex5iq/deleted_by_user/h8bnnlr/,3,r/petoskey,0,3

"As a 24 year old who was born and raised here, went to school in Grand Rapids, and moved back. You cannot go wrong here if those are the things you are into. There are so many amazing nature trails, hiking trails, and other outdoor things to do here both in the summer and winter. The Little Traverse Conservancy Organization has hundreds of miles of marked and maintained trails all over their many many many nature preserves. 

As for Skiing, within very close distance is both Nub's Nob (My personal favorite!), Boyne Highlands and Boyne Mountain. These places aren't quite as good as some of the outwest places, but will scratch that itch. 

Boating is a no brainer in the summer, we have a ton of smaller inland lakes (Crooked, Pickerel and Burt all come to mind right off the bat) as well as Little Traverse Bay (Lake Michigan) which is lovely. 

Being a touristy town in the summer, Petoskey has a ton of great resturants and bars, including some fun breweies (Petoskey Brewing is my favorite, but Beards isn't half bad either.) The surrounding areas are great as well, Boyne City, Harbor Springs, and Charlevoix all have good offerings. 

I think the only thing Petoskey may really lack is that Electronic/Alternative music scene. Most places here when they have live music have some crowd pleaser Rock guy or country. 

The only thing I will say to prepare yourself is to A. Have a car, everything is very spread out for the most part and the public transit is non-existent. B. Get ready for the summer time to be crazy busy and packed up here, the tourism is nuts! and C. Be ready for snow! The winters here are quite a bit longer and harder than Detroit, but if you enjoy skiing and other outdoor activities in the winter you should be fine!

"Hey welcome to the area.  This sub doesn't get a ton of eyeballs so I will chime in. 

I don't do much fishing myself but I have seen folks fishing off of the Bay View dock in Little Traverse Bay.  The water is very clear there and I rarely see fish so I'm not sure how successful that spot might be. 

There is an inland lake spot off of Pickerel Lake Rd.  Take Pickerel Lake Rd east from US 31 for a few miles.  It will curve to the left and right before you get to the Crooked Lake public access there is a bridge that goes over a swampy/marshy area and I have seen people fishing from there as well.

There are probably not the best spots but I didn't want you to go away empty handed!  I'll bet if you ask any bait shop they'd be happy to direct you to few places as well.

"His father runs a small cult and school called Burt Lake Northern Michigan Christian Academy in Levering, MI. 

His district is very rural and mainly a summer tourism destination. It was [districted by Republicans](https://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/michiganmaps) who grouped the large rural area with a fairly moderate town for wealthy summer cottages in Petoskey. Meaning his organized cult plus large rural areas that vote R always on principal, can outvote the liberal voters in Petoskey in his small district. Efforts to make such districting more neutral were just allowed to be [placed on the Michigan Ballot](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/07/31/michigan-supreme-court-gerrymandering-initiative/871624002/) Proposals this fall by the Michigan Supreme Court.

He graduated from his father's church ""school.""

He went to a Baptist college in Wisconsin that no longer exists.

His only job was as a teacher at his father's school. He was not certified for Michigan, but it didn't matter at the private Christian school.

His campaign was financed using his father's church cult's money.

He then, while raising 5 kids with his wife, also raised in the cult, and being a state legislator was able to get an online master's in political administration from the religious Liberty University.

The Michigan GOP made him #2 in the house and saw him as a rising star. Despite his main platforms to be ""education"" which he has no actual qualifications for and being anti-gay as a stance.

The irony is, he is the product of his father's cult and faux religious degrees and Republican districting. 

And here he is showing his stupidity, and the literal religious cult around him will instant forgive him I'm sure as the state GOP groom him to eventually succeed Bergman in US Congress.

""The Lord forgive those who take unregistered loaded guns in their bag and try to get on a plane. He just made an honest mistake leaving a loaded handgun in his bag during his 4 yr old daughter's birthday party and forgot to take it out. Could happen to anybody.""

And the crazier question is: [Is this a stunt just before his primary where he's facing someone to the right of him on gun control?](https://www.petoskeynews.com/featured-pnr/where-they-stand-legislative-primary-candidates-on-gun-control-school/article_55e9520c-8e71-11e8-9913-d7db35581185.html)",t2_1wdwd6dg,MIDistrict1,0,1533160068.0,0,t1_e3ft89t,e3ft89t,True,MIDistrict1,t3_93tdht,https://www.reddit.com/r/petoskey/comments/93tdht/rep_lee_chatfield_apologizes_after_loaded_gun/,Rep.

"Downtown has a couple good places. No ""Wing Places"", but a couple places I know of.

[Tap 30](http://tap30.com/food-menu/) has some pretty decent wings, and a few other solid options. And, of course, 30 taps of beer and cider.

[Mitchell Street Pub](https://www.mitchellstreetpub.com) also has wings, although only Spicy or Not. The White Chili is pretty damn good, as well as the burgers. And they also carry a ton of Michigan Craft beer.

[Beards Brewery](http://www.beardsbrewery.com/food) has House or Spicy Buffalo and an awesome Cherry BBQ made with their own beer. The Fish and Chips and the Jalepeno burger are also good.
 
A little out of town on M119, and is closer to Boyne Highlands and Nubs Nob:

[Petoskey Brewing Company](https://www.petoskeybrewing.com/menu) has a few different sauces with their wings, and of course, their own beer on tap.

It's a great place to live though, and truly beautiful.

Housing: Craigslist. 

Friday in summer: Bonfires with friends. Friday in winter: Drinking. 

Absent from town: Large malls. Fix: Go to Traverse City. 

Most of the summer population are older people who already have summer homes in the area (ALL of Bay View shuts down for the winter, and then opens in the summer for example). The other balloon is weekenders, or people from down state coming to visit. 

Biking is realistic, but it's quite hilly. There are good bike paths that connect the north and south sides of Petoskey, and continue all the way up to Harbor springs (and actually connect everywhere from Charlevoix up to Mackinaw if you want a long trip). 

Craft beer: There are 3? craft breweries in Petoskey IIRC (I actually live in Ann Arbor now, but was raised in P-town and go back at least monthly). Beards Brewery is my favorite, but it's because my buddy owns/runs it. Stop in and say hi to Ben. Then ask him about his eye. There's also Petoskey Brewing (out by the state park, you'll have to take the bike trail).
