"I’m glad to hear that, I have spent quite some time in lake county (Waukegan) and the city of Chicago during my visits there. But as a SoCal native I really like the north shore and areas between the city all the way to Waukegan more. Enjoy the food and coffee shops more in Arlington heights, Libertyville, Skokie, Vernon Hills, and Evanston than the city. I’m from the San Fernando Valley and this place is too fast paced now, I really enjoyed that slower pace life style in the Illinois suburbs.

im moving to evanston/wilmette area. i spent like 6 months trying out suburbs and the north shore does feel kind of like southern california to me. proximity to the lake is the obvious one- but there's also just more nature and good walking paths that way. we don't have hills to hike here, but lots of bike paths on the north shore are keeping me optimistic. also proximity to wisconsin for more nature.

the fact that the north shore has the metra line into chicago, purple line for transit, and lots of downtown areas along green bay road in each neighborhood makes me pretty excited about the north shore. haven't tried a single restaurant up there, but there's plenty of them. a lot going on without feeling like you 'have to' go to chicago for culture and activity.",t2_104n2n,interstellargh,0,1648846384.0,0,t1_i314tfx,i314tfx,True,JUJR1995,t3_tmngox,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tmngox/best_chicago_suburb_for_la_native/,Best Chicago suburb for LA Native?,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tmngox/best_chicago_suburb_for_la_native/i314tfx/,2,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,2

"I've lived in Naperville for 25+ years and will challenge a few of the other opinions and agree with some others.

Taxes are high, especially if you're in the Will County part of N'ville.  You're paying for all the new high schools recently built.

Schools are great, very competitive and highly political. If you're hoping for your kids to play sports, the competition is huge and your son or daughter needs to have an A game or be kissing the coaches arses.

Drugs are bad in the high school system.  Naperville Central had a heroin problem for years.  A bad side effect of affluence.

Crime in Naperville isn't fully reported in order to maintain the perception of safety.

Traffic can be terrible, as noted.  Even with the expansion of 59 to 3 lanes in both directions is can take 15 minutes to go from 88 to Ogden.

Restaurant quality have improved dramatically and there are now great areas of restaurants..  

Activities, again, great. Golf courses are well maintained. North Central College brings some nice performing arts to the city.

Depending on the part of the city you're in, it can be very friendly or very snooty.

Naperville has a known swingers community if that's your thing.

Given the choice between the options you listed, Lake in the Hills/Huntley/Algonquin would be my first choice.",t2_gun6uheo,JustAGoodGuy1080,0,1648838719.0,0,t1_i30mfp3,i30mfp3,True,helpdesk-26,t3_ttai36,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/ttai36/what_are_the_overall_vibes_of_these_areas/,What are the overall vibes of these areas?,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/ttai36/what_are_the_overall_vibes_of_these_areas/i30mfp3/,1,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,1

I have also went to 3 national forests that are around, Shawnee, Chequamegon and Manistee, Ive also been down to Hoosier national forest as well. i have also driven around Lake Michigan (5 day trip but got to go to so many beaches, cliffs, forests, towns, etc). For 4wheeling or snowmobiling I like to go to WI where they have great trails that go from town to town.

I also enjoy being close to not only one of the largest lakes in the world and all the beaches but a world class city that has countless things to do and offer. several pro sports teams and close proximity to 40+ or so minor league baseball teams to visit.

"I like the location and vibe of Glenview the most out of all of those.  I'd probably pick that if I could afford it.  

You have the best access to both the city and the suburbs, plus the Gallery Park area with the lake in Glenview is top tier.  Hard to think of a better suburban location to spend a lot of weekend afternoons if it's in your backyard.  And you have a bunch of cool forest preserves within 10 minutes.  I live in nearby Des Plaines now and think this is far and away the best location in the suburbs logistically.  Things within 20 minute drive: Ravinia, Allstate Arena, Des Plaines theater, 4-5 great forest preserve locations, any grocer you want, Botanic Gardens, Rosemont entertainment district, Northbrook/Skokie shopping, over a hundred restaurants.  Plus metra access to downtown.  

The north/west suburbs are nice enough but you're kind of landlocked- there's no great way to get anywhere else from Crystal Lake/Lake in the Hills, so you'd better like Crystal Lake. 

Those areas are all pretty different in terms of property values and property taxes.  You're looking across a few counties there.  I'd definitely look at those as part of your budget.  

Honestly, the areas don't seem to have that much in common with each other, unless they rank high on some list someone put together.  I can see different people loving to live in any of them, depending on what they like to do.

McHenry: Its way out there and there isn't a whole lot of interesting stuff going on there. It may be on the Fox but its night and day different than places like St. Charles. Pretty conservative and tends to be older residents.

"This is only true IF YOU DO NOT LOSE THE TITLE.

The state of IL has no idea you've paid off the car until the DMV or SOS has seen that signature. So if you lose the title and go to the DMV to get a new one, the DMV is going to think you still have a lienholder. At which point you'll have to contact your lienholder and get a notarized lien release (which some lenders charge you for). Then once you have the lien release, you'll need to take that back to the state and pay for a new title.

Some park districts allow people to sign up and pay as an individual and then add them to teams, and other districts will ask around to already registered teams to see if any are looking for more players/subs.

"You're supposed to park on bluff road. I went down a road I'm not sure you're supposed to use. Basically if you're heading south on lemont road you pass bluff road and make the next right on the street where the trucks are always coming out of. That takes you over Des plaines River and you make a right on the street right next to the trail. Just take that road all the way until you're under 355. That's where I parked. And then walked on the trail parallel to 355 and basically under 355. After you get over the Des plaines River look for a trail to your left. Should be able to see the Tower and the trail and figure it out. Also if you are taking an SUV what you could do is keep following that road and it just keeps going and going for quite a while. We did a little off-roading back. It goes on for a while until you hit a bunch of stone blocks in the road.

\--------

We moved to Schaumburg from San Francisco. We have no family out here, just moved because it was time to ""place down roots."" I transfered my job to Chicago and my husband works from home.  
We picked Schaumburg because it's (somewhat) diverse and has immersion schools starting at Kindergarten. We've now lived here for about 7 months, our son starts Kindergarten in the fall and we've bought a house in the school district we wanted.  
The good:  
\-VERY little homeless. Like, I've only seen a few people begging for money, and even then, they are known in the village (they are called villages out here, not cities, not sure why) as people to beg, and from what I understand they are not actually poor.  
\-It's clean. I'm not sure if San Diego is dirty, but in the Bay Area there's just trash... Everywhere. It's not that way here.  
\-It's safe. I don't have to make sure there's nothing showing in my car when I park it.  
\-Everything I need is here. There's two Targets, two Costcos, and everything in between.  
\-SO much for kids to do. There are multiple small theme parks, Lego-something at the mall, small waterslide parks, splash pads, ect.  
The bad:  
\-There's not as much diversity as I expected. It's still very white. Sure, there's a few minorities mixed in, but where I live especially, it's 95% white.  
\- People don't walk too much. There are people who walk around the block with their kids, or dogs, so you'll see some, but I'm used to seeing people walking everywhere, all the time.  
\-Not too many healthy eating out options. We used to go out to eat a lot, and had a lot of options for healthy food. It's just not the case here. There's VERY few places that market as healthy.  
\-No mountains for hiking nearby. We used to hike multiple times a month... We haven't gone at all since we've lived here, I wouldn't even know where to go.  
Best of luck to you!

\-VERY little homeless. Like, I've only seen a few people begging for money, and even then, they are known in the village (they are called villages out here, not cities, not sure why) as people to beg, and from what I understand they are not actually poor.  
\-It's clean. I'm not sure if San Diego is dirty, but in the Bay Area there's just trash... Everywhere. It's not that way here.  
\-It's safe. I don't have to make sure there's nothing showing in my car when I park it.  
\-Everything I need is here. There's two Targets, two Costcos, and everything in between.   
\-SO much for kids to do. There are multiple small theme parks, Lego-something at the mall, small waterslide parks, splash pads, ect. 

The bad:   
\-There's not as much diversity as I expected. It's still very white. Sure, there's a few minorities mixed in, but where I live especially, it's 95% white.  
\- People don't walk too much. There are people who walk around the block with their kids, or dogs, so you'll see some, but I'm used to seeing people walking everywhere, all the time.  
\-Not too many healthy eating out options. We used to go out to eat a lot, and had a lot of options for healthy food. It's just not the case here. There's VERY few places that market as healthy.  
\-No mountains for hiking nearby. We used to hike multiple times a month... We haven't gone at all since we've lived here, I wouldn't even know where to go.

You might have a hard time in some areas suggested with your budget. I have friends trying to buy in wheaton / Lombard with a slightly higher budget and it’s incredibly difficult . When you see a listing price assume that you’ll need to bid over asking right now especially at that price point. Get a very good realtor once you narrow down an area. Look at Elk Grove/ schaumburg / Hoffman estates .

"No. Maplewood does get flooding during a one-hundred year flood, but only in the yards and streets. The homes there are indeed expensive. The area that floods the worst is West Avenue just south of Forest Avenue where there is no berm to prevent flooding of those properties.   


Groveland has a berm alongside it that prevents river flooding, but the problem is that during more severe floods the flood water in Maplewood comes through the yards into Park Place and thus Lincoln and Groveland. After which, it fills up like a fish bowl. The proposed replacement levee would run from the train tracks up to Park Place then follow Park Place to Woodside Rd.

"I would recommend checking out the fox valley region so Batavia, Geneva and st charles. Plenty of bike path, forest preserves, and overall plenty of outdoors.

If you want something closer to the city Naperville is another good place though it is much larger and crowded than the fox velvet region.

I would look at Shorewood/Plainfield if I were you personally. The area isn't terribly diverse but it's close to Joliet which has to s of supermercados and it's close to Naperville which has as asian market. They're right by I55 and I80 so traveling would be easy. I think they have bike paths and some of the areas are gorgeous. Joliet also has a train station that has trains going to and from Chicago all day and every other hour on weekends. The houses are in your price range. With your specifications. And Joliet Junior College is right on the other side of I55 from Shorewood. Shorewood and Plainfield are very safe.

"Second the suggestion for batavia, st. charles, geneva, these have really wholesome communities and nice town centers for walking around etc.

I lived in Warrenville for over a year and wanted to love it, but it really lacks a real downtown center designed for people rather than for cars. Everything there is just in underwhelming strip malls.

Naperville is kind of obnoxious  & tacky.. plenty of money but cringey mcmansion taste.

"Nearly all of Riverside's homes are well above any flood risk from the Des Plaines and climate change is quite unlikely to change that. Once water rises out of the river channel and into the floodplain the amount of flow to increase flood level increases dramatically. The difference between a 1-in-100 years flood and a 1-in-1000 year flood is like an inch in flood level, perhaps even tenths of an inch.

However, on the NW side of Riverside there is a section that wasn't part of Olmstead's plan that is at risk of river flooding. There is funding to build a levee to fix that, which I believe will come to pass. Regardless, that area is mostly multi-family or starter homes, which I think this person wouldn't be interested in.

However, one thing to be aware of throughout the Chicago Suburbs is that our lovely combined sewer-overflow system can cause flooding well away from any river. As such, even if you wouldn't think an area would flood, one should always ask about it.",t2_qcrd0,mr_yozhik,0,1648614352.0,0,t1_i2od2mh,i2od2mh,False,Ok-Cartographer-5544,t3_trh4q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/trh4q7/best_place_to_live_in_cook_county_regardless_of/,"Best place to live in Cook County, regardless of cost?",/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/trh4q7/best_place_to_live_in_cook_county_regardless_of/i2od2mh/,1,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,1

"For biking and running I would look at places that are on Prairie paths. the Chicagoland area has some of the best Rails to Trails prairie paths in the country. These are mainly in the western burbs but it looks like you have been looking in the western burbs

Illinois Prairie Path: Stretches from Oak Park to Wheaton where it splits north to Elgin or South to Aurora. It also links up with the Great western train and the fox river trail

Fox River Path (Paved but probably the most scenic): Aurora to Elgin (runs N to South)

Great Western Trail: Starts in Villa Park and goes all the way west passed Dekalb.

The suburbs with the highest asian populations were Naperville (Shocking I know!), Oak Brook and Hoffman Estates. I dont really picture any of these as high asian areas although Naperville has a Asian Market as does Arlington Heights

Hispanic population, youd be looking at Aurora, Elgin and West Chicago.

For considerations of having a young family I am factoring in good schools, low crime, safe communities, easy access downtown.

Naperville: Its huge and traffic can really suck here. You are further from actual bike paths but there is a fair share of forest preserves. has an amazing downtown and basically 2 metra stops to chicago.virtually no crime and some of the best schools in the area. Also has a community college that is downtown naperville. You will def get way less house for your money, I preferably would take my money and go elsewhere

Warenville: More spread out, has less of a traditional downtown and isnt very walkable. It is surrounded by forest preserves, has good schools and the Prairie path runs right through the town. No metra stop however but housing is more affordable. Not far from college of dupage community college (which is in Glen ellyn and ranked as one of the best CC's in the country)

Geneva: If I was working remote, I would live in the river valley area (batavia, geneva, st charles). Geneva has some great schools, virtually no crime, really great downtown and 3rd street, you have the fox river to fish, and canoe or kyak, and the fox river path that connects with both paths in a short distance. Geneva has the metra station but its about 45min-50min to get to downtown chicago. Close to aurora for hispanic food/markets. Community college that is close is Waubonse

St. Charles: further from the highways which may be a negative but probably the more built up and modern downtowns. Again has virtually no crime, close to elgin for hispanic markets. On the fox river path but also has great western trail that goes through here. very good schools as well. Community college that is close is waubonse

Batavia: again on the fox river so its safe and has some great outdoor items. The downtown is a little more quiet out of the three but nothing small like warrenville. great schools and closer to the highway for easy access. Community college that is close is waubonse

Lombard: The IPP runs straight through here, and it has has good schools. Out of the options above you will find the more affordable housing here. But you are also smack dab in the middle of the chicagoland so easy access to anywhere.

&#x200B;

I would say wheaton but it may be the least diverse suburb. Its very christian but also extremely safe. Its also very expensive but the IPP runs right through here and the schools are awesome.

&#x200B;

So if you want more cookie-cutter neighborhood and the safest (99.9% no crime): Naperville

more outdoorsy, cute town vibe that is 99.8% safe: Geneva

small town vibe but modern busier downtown 99.8% safe: St. Charles

small town vibe and small town feel 99.7% safe: Batavia

quiet town but not far from everything 99.0% safe: Warenville

safe and in the middle of it all: 98.5% safe: Lombard",t2_3igbky5c,buffalobutt12,0,1648611897.0,0,t1_i2o8ob7,i2o8ob7,True,lopzas,t3_trx69v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/trx69v/out_of_state_house_search/,Out of State House Search,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/trx69v/out_of_state_house_search/i2o8ob7/,9,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,9

"""A state law the Illinois Legislature passed six years ago offers property tax breaks to disabled vets who qualify. It wipes out the tax bills on their homes entirely if the federal Department of Veterans Affairs certifies they are at least 70% disabled.  
The law puts a limit on how expensive a home can be to qualify for the break. It has to have “an equalized assessed value of less than $250,000” — which translates this year in Cook County to a market value of about $775,000. The county assessor determines the market value and the assessed value. And the state applies what’s called a multiplier to equalize assessments from one county to another statewide.  
But in dozens of instances every year, Cook County has ignored that limit under former Assessor Joseph Berrios and now under Kaegi,a fellow Democrat who challenged and defeated him, promising tax reform, doling out these tax breaks to disabled vets living in homes too expensive to qualify under the Illinois law.  
As a result, those vets have gotten tax breaks they didn’t qualify for, deeply discounting or erasing their property taxes by as much as $28,000 this year.""

"In Illinois, it's actually *relatively* easy to collect if you know what you're doing. You know what bank your rent check is being deposited (or sent via ACH or Zelle or whatever). So you can seize the funds from their account. It's a pretty straightforward process (compared to most states, anyway). You'll pay a small filing fee upfront to do it, which you'll also recover when you collect. 

The bank places a hold for double your judgement amount. Then, they will send you a cashier's check after a certain amount of time (should be 30 days). There's a bit more to it than that, but I was the person at the bank that placed the holds and sent the checks. As a bonus, the bank will *also* charge your landlord an astronomical fee after you're paid.

And I think Playroom has upper age limits, whereas at Ball Factory, there were usually much bigger kids vying for space. 

All of this with the caveat that we last visited all of these places pre-Covid, so current reality may be way different. 

I’m seeing conflicting info on if it’s still open, but 2Toots Train Whistle Grill was also always a hit with my niece.

"I can’t even begin to recommend @glitterjellybean on Instagram enough! I’ve been seeing her since pre-covid when she was in a salon downtown, after they closed up she started doing house calls and recently opened her own studio space in the far west side of west loop, but she still does house calls (for a $15 fee). She’s genuinely one of the most kind and wholesome people I know, and she’s insanely talented on top of that. She does everything from minimalist modern nail art all the way to super realistic painting of your pets on nails. There’s never been anything I’ve shown her that she hasn’t been able to do. Her prices are reasonable too. 

Her studio is just a small space split between herself and a hairstylist and they usually don’t overlap - she’ll go out of her way to make sure you’re comfy there. Otherwise, if you prefer a house call, she brings everything she needs! I tried quite a few different places in the suburbs before I realized she was doing house calls and no one has been able to touch the quality of work she does.",t2_g5fsg,neurogeneticist,0,1648387969.0,0,t1_i2b7x6u,i2b7x6u,True,paxenb,t3_tp5w9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tp5w9x/nail_salons_that_specialize_in_unusual_styles/,Nail salons that specialize in unusual styles?,/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tp5w9x/nail_salons_that_specialize_in_unusual_styles/i2b7x6u/,2,r/ChicagoSuburbs,0,2

"I've been taking that train every working day for years. (commuter) 

The worst I've ever seen are wild teens during concert season. Like when Lollapalooza is downtown, they'll take up all the seats and be unruly. It's not 'unsafe' per-say, just annoying. The worst teen I've seen was smoking a cigar shamelessly and was kicked off at the Glen Ellyn stop going outbound. 

Maybe three months before the pandemic, I saw a dude on the first floor during my commute home shooting up heroine on the Metra UP-W line. (he shot up while the train was waiting to depart at the station.) Again, they promptly removed and arrested him after it was reported at the next stop. (This was still safe for other passengers, he just passed out in his seat.)

Finally I'd say that while not unsafe, the last undesirable thing is when the cubs were doing super well and had some sort of parade a few years back. (forgive me, I'm not a sports fan so I don't exactly know what was going on.) They allowed so many people to pack into the cars that I felt it was unsafe.

"Without giving more information, you are only going to get responses on where people live currently, because they just want you to move to their area. 

I tend to always suggest staying around the western suburbs. You have easy access to both airports as well as the city and if you ever change jobs or need to get to the northern suburbs or southern suburbs you are already smack in the middle.

I am not sure on your budget, your likes and dislikes so I will try to list each one.

**Downers Grove**: Great downtown, easy access to the city (metra and highway), has some decent night life if you are into that, great schools, low crime, more on the expensive side. You are close to shopping in Oak Brook, and if you like biking, running, etc you are close to the prairie path in lombard and the arboretum in lisle.

**Lisle**: Great downtown but smaller than Downers Grove. Great schools and some even feed into Naperville. Can easily get downtown either car or metra train. Safe as well and more affordable than Downers without too much compromise. 

**Lombard:** Has a slightly bigger downtown than lisle which has some great places to eat, drink, etc. Easy access to downtown via highway or metra. Its on a different line than Lisle and Downers grove (I prefer this line than BNSF which is lisle and DG, tends to have cleaner, newer cars but less trains during rush times). Right on the prairie path (I believe two run through Lombard).

**Glen Ellyn:** Small town vibe, extremely expensive, great schools and easy access DT via metra (UPW) or highway. I would move here if you had a family, as a young person I would not.

**Naperville:** Extremely safe and a amazing downtown, best out of the ones above. Great if you are young and like to go out. Be warned though, Naperville traffic is HORRIBLE. I moved away and I prefer visiting naperville than living there. It could take you 40min to drive across naperville in rush hour but npaerville is also very big.

"Ed and Joe's for pizza (taco pizza is really good but expensive so we usually just get a family thin crust), Tandoori house for Indian, Eggheadz for breakfast/brunch, Sem sem for Mediterranean/middle Eastern, Saigon for Vietnamese, I could go on and on lol.  Is there any particular cuisine you like/don't like?  I also love supporting local in case you can't tell!  Rubinos is a great Italian deli too, and the sandwiches are HUGE.  I second Mickey's as well.",t2_9mtr2,Hodana_the_Kat,0,1648263714.0,0,t1_i25f3y6,i25f3y6,True,Apprehensive-Ear-426,t3_tocmdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoSuburbs/comments/tocmdb/what_are_some_lesser_known_underrated_restaurants/,what are some lesser known underrated restaurants in Tinley Park?

Well since like a dozen legit answers didn’t find a winner I’ll just throw in the worst outdoor history area in the entire country - Fort Snelling. It’s located next to the largest amusement park in MN - Valleyfair. Basically as big as 6 Flags and 20min from Minneapolis. We’d go to stupid Fort Snelling on field trips every year and think they’d surprise us and pull the Valleyfair switcheroo. But no. Never. Always stupid Fort Snelling.
