"We've recently gone through the math. On a purely financial basis, AC is cheaper when you look at the cost to buy, install/maintain, and run, for the time being. This cost will go up in the coming years, and the price for all of this for a heat pump will almost certainly go down, but it likely will be a several years before you'd come out ahead with having installed a heat pump. So purely from a math perspective, AC makes sense if you only have money for that and would have to borrow for the added cost of a heat pump, especially if you aren't sure if you'll be selling your place before the payoff period to start coming out ahead. However, if you have the money and are planning on staying in the house for a decade plus, a heat pump most likely will have you come out ahead in the long run.

Something to also keep in mind is that the Canada Greener Homes Grant has money for air sealing and insulation, and those might help your house significantly if it's older.

"I'll clarify this for you as I work related to this in energy efficiency.

AC and Heat pump the exact same technology. Your fridge and freezer use the same tech as well.

Any comments about usage, electricity vs gas, and sizing ill sum up here.

Sizing - you need to get a unit appropriately sized for the conditions. In most of Alberta (like all of it), if you get below 30C you need a back up, so a heat pump will likely not be replacing your furnace at this time. This isn't a negative, but you are comparing ac cooling to heat pump cooling AND some highly efficient heating.
If you size it for heating for -20, that's a different question than just sizing it for cooling and a bonus if heating. You don't need it sized for heating and you should double check the estimate that aspect.

Efficiency - an AC can be just as efficient cooling as heat pump. These are specific ratings on the model. If you want long term benefit, look at the SEER and compare that for the operating cost.
Heating efficiency and the benefit of heat pump is that they can be 250% and up efficient for heating vs a condensing gas furnace - highest i see on a regular basis is 96%, but 97% and 98% do exist, but that is the maximum.
The trick is electricity doesn't count for generation and transmission. Generally if our grid is all natural gas, its a comparable efficiency at 250% efficient (some models for heat pump are higher). For future use, if we get more renewable or nuclear or anything thats not carbon based, then heat pumps is a clear win for heating as well.
For long term predictions, if winter become more mild as climate change happens, then heat pump is more a win, if natural gas demand is increased by current and future demands but electricity doesn't increase as much, then heat pump is the win. So some of the calculations if you want to factor in heating electric vs gas is what your future predictions say.

So if you only want cooling, then yes, AC is the most cost effective choice short term.
If you do the math to put in the heating offset and future price factors, heat pumps could very likely be the better choice.

As a comment on the current industry - they will push AC, not because heat pumps don't work, but because they have stock in AC, they likely have certain deals or contracts for such, they have more experience with them, and heat pumps do have a higher base cost, so it is easier to overcome pricing concerns with a cheaper AC. You may have to do a bit more digging for heat pump installers than AC.

Personally, with what I see happening, and the grants from greener homes for 5000$, maybe others in your local grants, id only do a heat pump at this time, and if I waited 5 years, it d only make more sense for heat pump.

A system like this is locked in for 20-30 years.

You can also dual heat your home with a HP and a furnace if it's too cold out for the heat pump to not condensate.

Having lived here, I've noticed that the climate is ripe for majority heat pump usage. Just make sure to have a smart thermostat that can default to a furnace when the efficiency drops in the heat pump. You will need to check though if your furnace can support having a heat pump installed; it's a thing about the fan activating to circulate heat while the furnace is not in use.

"Book 2: Nature  


""Canada, the most affluent of countries, operates on a depletion economy which leaves destruction in its wake. Your people are driven by a terrible sense of deficiency. When the last tree is cut, the last fish is caught, and the last river is polluted; when to breathe the air is sickening, you will realize, too late, that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you can’t eat money."" - Alanis Obomsawin  


Chapter 1: Water  


""Anyone who can solve the problem of water will be worthy for 2 Nobel Prizes 1 for science and 1 for peace"" - John Fitzgerald Kennedy  


Water is often said to be our most precious resource, it is not called the ""universal solvent"" for nothing. Nearly every industrial application, building, and even life itself require water to work yet we waste it on an incredible basis. We actively pollute our watersheds and leave our tailings to be swept into the ocean. Due to this many people in remote areas have lost the ability to access clean water.   
In order to preserve our most precious resource it is necessary to force companies to clean up after themselves. Thus laws will be put in place for companies to foot the entire bill for any environmental cleanup operations caused by their activities. A portion of the royalty money will be reserved in the event that they cannot complete their obligations. Furthermore the Board of Executives will be held directly liable for the cleanup expenses in the event that company assets are not enough.   
These measures may seem draconian however the are necessary to making sure that our water remains pure, our lakes remain swimmable, and all of us may experience the joy of cooling off with a splash on a summer day for generations to come.   


Chapter 2: Earth  


Years ago, I told my father it was 'just dirt.' But it's not just dirt. It's where we live. It's our dirt, dammit. -Gage Yevgenny (Halo: Evolutions)  


We get the vast majority of our wealth from the earth, yet we leave it scarred and pitted, long festering wounds on it's surface. Industries that deal with extracting materials from the earth such as mining, logging, agriculture, and the like should have environmental assessments done. with the same cleanup rules applying as those for water. If companies want to extract materials from our dirt, we're definitely going to make them pay for it.  
And as to lessen the burden on the earth a robust return chain needs to be implemented reuseables, recycleables, and composting would all be necessary to become the ""decomposers"" of the anthrosphere. The ability to return bottles for sterilization and reuse as well as laws for right to repair. Reusability, recyclability, and repair-ability criteria the need to be met by all goods would be introduced into law and a demonstration of the recycling process would also be required. A small tax on new material will be used to subsidize the costs of recycled material. Returnables/reuseables would be place din a separate box before being sent to a sorting facility and shipped back to the manufacturer or recycled if the wear is too much.   


Chapter 3: Fire  


""Fire is life, not just destruction"" - Sun Warrior Chief (Avatar)  


But how will we power all of this? There are many ways to power things, in every case save for nuclear power all of our energy comes from the sun, whether stored in the remains of algae for tens of millions of years (oil) or directly in the form of solar panels. We are close to causing a climate disaster and thus we must diversify our energy sources. To do this we can go back to the caveman days relying on insulation to keep us warm or we can store the energy. While insulation and updated building standards are a good way to start (use less energy) there is still a major need for the production of energy. One way to start is to implement a combination of grid scale storage and timing regimes, an example of this is charging your car at work. Other improvements come through the use of large scale public transportation, namely trains, allowing for energy use during the day when solar energy is plentiful. 

Alberta is one of the sunniest provinces and best positioned for distributed energy. The parking lots in Calgary alone would be enough to power the entire city if they were covered in solar panels. As such I would implement a ""free solar panels"" policy where the government would pay for the sizing, installation, and cost of solar panels in parking lots and homes for a fixed rate electricity bill. The electricity bill would actually be a 0% financing plan over 10 years after which the cost of the panel and installation would be fully paid off. Smart meters mean that a Crown corporation utility company can buy the power at a cheaper rate during the day and sell it back from grid scale storage at night.   
But Alberta also has other energy assets that are not solar. we have multiple hydroelectric dams in Rockies, wind in the crowsnest pass, and even high altitude airstreams. I would order the development of vertical axis wind turbines and eventually a flying wind turbine that would allow for the VAWT to be lifted into the sky and generate power. Even limited scale nuclear reactors would be a good thing. This would not be a substitute for primary distributed solar but merely a supplement. Base load power makes up the majority of our energy use (aside from vehicles) and replacing this entirely with nuclear power is not a sustainable option given the low density of uranium in uranium ore.   


Chapter 4: Air

“Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Jaques Yves Cousteau 

Lastly to deal with air pollution it would be necessary to do carbon capture. But not merely storage. Carbon capture could be used to make Carbon fiber. A cap and trade program could be used to make this a viable industry, you would be paid at both sides of the supply chain.

"I think the primary changes Alberta needs are related to 3 primary causes. Infrastructure, Economy, and Environment

Most of the comments I've read say high speed rail, roads, hospitals, education, lack of needs met due to poverty, and concern for our natural beauty, etc.

The changes I would make if I was SUPREME EVIL DICTATOR OF ALBERTA:

Book 1: Economy

""A Prince can never secure himself against disaffected people, their number being too great"" - Niccolo Machiavelli 

Chapter 1: Upflow & Downflow

""One must consider not only the flow of money coming down but also the flow going up. There must be balance in order to maintain a functional economy"" - Astro\_Alphard

My first move would be to make sure that the rate of the money flowing down is in balance to the rate of money flowing up. This requires the funding of the people to allow them to live good lives while at the same time suppressing greed. In order to stabilize the system there needs to be a massive shift of wealth towards the lower classes. Once the system is stabilized and the wealth at the base is greater than the wealth at the top the tax code must be adjusted to allow for the rates of upflow and downflow to be in balance.

One must do detailed economic modelling to achieve this balance and be aware that money cycles, it does not come from nowhere.

Thus these 2 assumptions form the basis of my hypothesis.

Chapter 2: Taxes & Royalties

""No government can exist without taxation. This money must necessarily be levied on the people; and the grand art consists of levying so as not to oppress."" -Frederick the Great

I would start by bringing the corporate tax rate up to 13% and add on tax breaks for small businesses. Furthermore I would shift the tax policy such that investments are taxed heavily and employment income is taxed minimally. Certain registered funds such as a retirement fund with contribution limits would not be taxed. A progressive income tax would be required with a 70% income tax rate on the highest levels of wealth. I would also put a tariff on any money being transfered into accounts in known tax havens in amounts above 1 million dollars per year equal to the tax rate.

All these measures would be to ensure that money comes from actual work and goes to the people doing the work. That the balance of upflow and downflow rewards those who put in work and not those who leech off the backs of the workers through investments or mere ownership.

Furthermore I would bring back Alberta's oil royalties at the 20% rate. A carbon tax of 20% or a cap and trade program would be implemented (an appropriately taxed). The funds from this will be allocated to environmental issues.

Chapter 3: Crime & Poverty

""The majority of crime is that born from Poverty""

The solution to crime is to make sure people don't have a reason to commit it. This means guaranteeing the life of the individual and allowing them to maintain a certain standard of living such that they may be ready.

Expansion of government aid to the poor, education on how to do taxes, and a cap on rents and real estate prices as well as utility and insurance rates. Most of these benefits will be funded by the revised tax code. Minimum wage laws will be updated to meet the living standard allowing for minimum wage to afford a modest life for a married couple and a single child.

Chapter 4: Growth & Stability

""Economy is the basis of society. When the economy is stable, society develops. The ideal economy combines the spiritual and the material, and the best commodities to trade in are sincerity and love."" -Morihei Ueshiba, The Art of Peace

Many people compare water and the economy and I have done much the same with my analogies of upflow and downflow. An economy where everyone makes the same amount of money is stagnant and has no direction. An economy that is solely dedicated to greed and personal desire breeds resentment resulting in instability. While I do not have specific numbers on how to make the economy a certain way there is a model that I find useful when explaining it.

Imagine a building made of bricks of money with the layers as the economic classes, the height of the pyramid is it's economic power and the width of the pyramid is it's economic stability. One only has a finite amount of money to build this building out of. To any engineer it is obvious that the ideal shape is a style of pyramid with more money on the bottom than on the top. Yet many will say that the economy is not strong enough and go out of their way to stack the money higher and higher eroding the stability, some will even split the bricks of cash in half in an attempt to create more building blocks (inflation) and stack the bricks ever higher (growth) claiming that it is necessary to maintain the health of the economy. This is all in vain when a disaster strikes. Finding the right balance is crucial to maintaining a stable and just economy. And one cannot do it by expecting to expand ad infinitum.

"So are you saying that accountants, lawyers, optometrists, pharmacists and realtors also have conflicts of interest and shouldn’t be self-regulating?

Another thing to consider - because it is a professional association as well as a union, the ATA has a huge incentive to get rid of bad teachers to uphold the reputation of the rest. If the disciplinary function is removed, the only incentive the ATA will have as a union is to protect its members, no matter what.

"As a teacher, I can say that the main issue with school is the students themselves. You were one day a kid/teenager. You can understand, it's harder for them to speak french than english, so they just speak english.

On one side, we could so nothing, which in turn makes them wonder why they are in a french program (french immerson, francophone school). I have heard of teacher letting the kid talk to them in english and they would answer in french. It's sad, but it's a though battle.

On the other, we could punish them for speaking english. They will just leave or get a sour taste. That's when you loose them and they won't send their kids to the program.

For sure, some teacher don't have the ""proper"" level of french, but if you are waiting for that, you won't have programs at all. I think what Boards should do is give them a job first, then make sure they upgrade their french level by taking mandatory classes. It may seems mean, but they got a job because they speak french, not because they are teachers.

For the speaking parts, there is a lot francophone activities all around the province. In my region, there is a meet up every month. Sometimes shows, sometime supper. We even have a big hockey tournament in french. If you look with your local ACFA or francophone school, you might be surprise what is offered.

"I still grieve. Having said that, after nice and high marks in grade school in the Peace River Region, I only scored a 50 something on the Departments. This was 1988-1989. I went to U of A and could not qualify for the harder French courses (I was just taking one language course because I was taking the BMus at the time). BMus is inside the arts program.  


I didn't marry a French man. He was 1/2 English/mutt and 1/2 Ukrainian. This is considered not right in the francophonie culture, I think. Also, in Edmonton, it was easier for me to get jobs when I passed as English. I learned to not mention the French in general.

My son speaks English, Spanish and Japanese. He asked for Japanese instead of French, and I said yes. I couldn't image him sitting through more conjugation, when he had plenty with the Spanish. The Spanish was part of a Saturday school where cultural learning was paramount. They had art/dance/food, and then language things. This was my ex-husband's hobby at the time, and so I went along.

Now, I no longer identify as French. I am French enough, but the culture is not included in my present life, as I am no longer Catholique. It is amazing to think that if you are not part of the Church, then there is no French culture left.

It really didn't help that my original French was not considered proper by the University, and that later on in my insurance job, I couldn't communicate with the Quebecois moving to Edmonton.

"Thank you very much!

We are trying to figure out what to do with our kids. We intended to send them to French immersion, but when our oldest was 3, the school board announced that the French immersion program was cut for budget reasons. We could drive half an hour to one of two other districts for her to go, but that's a huge commitment with two younger kids to take along (not to mention the price of fuel.)

My father-in-law came from Quebec in 1982, and certainly never lost it as he's taught at French immersion schools. My husband's two siblings did French immersion until high school. My husband started but unfortunately couldn't continue because of partial hearing loss and learning disabilities; basically, English school was a steep challenge, never mind adding a second language. We would like our kids to learn French for both the extended family and for career options, but we're trying to figure out what to do yet.

"Homes have a service ampacity calculation determined by Canadian Electrical Code. This is done using the square footage of the home plus your range, clothes dryer and other loads in your home. Have a qualified journeyman electrician evaluate it for you. For most modern homes this will add up to a 100Amp service. Most insurance companies prefer a 100Amp service and I have had to upgrade services and panel boards to 100A when insurance companies have requested it from home owners. The cable that feeds the house must be rated for the load. You can’t just change a main breaker out. The cable from the transformer must be sized to suit the main breaker and the panel (the metal can that holds all of the breakers) has to be rated for the main breaker also.

"Did you listen to her talk show at any point?  I did occasionally, purely for entertainment value.  

Smith is remarkable in that she can seem intelligent and well spoken one moment and espouse completely insane conspiracy theories the next.  It's almost as if a part of her brain just failed to develop.  

There was enough stuff of sufficient craziness in her show that just resurfacing it will doom her bid for re-election, even in a rural riding.  Yes, there will always be some people who fall for *some* of the same things as Smith, but I sincerely doubt a majority of any riding in Alberta would fall for *everything* Smith has fallen for.  

Is someone who probably won't be able to win a seat a serious candidate for party leader?  Probably not.  However, I have a funny feeling the same gullibility that makes Smith susceptible to QAnon nonsense is being used to get her back into UCP politics now.  She is highly unlikely to win a leadership race, but she might help split votes away from other old-guard Wildrosers like Brian Jean.

"I fucking hate this post and you going through it.  I wish you both the best and hope it works out.

We need to also realize this is a political decision.  We are not putting enough resources into our ""insert basically any social service"" while a few people make billions.  And the secret is not to tax them (thought I am on board) it is to make them pay the workers who make them their money better.  If the pandemic taught us anything, healthcare and retail deserve way more and we have to make politicians make that happen.

I live in a small town, a town where a few years ago no one would pay $500k for just about any house in this town.  Now you cannot get a house for 500k.  2 people making $25 an hour cannot afford to buy a house starting from nothing in a fucking small town that does not even have a chain restaurant.  We are losing nurses at unprecedented rates because we pay them like shit and let people bully them, our emergency dept had to close overnight from lack of staff.

"I'm in eastern Alberta, so not much fracking out here. As you likely know already, it's hard as a female to get respect and decent oilfield jobs. It is changing, and I hope it starts to go faster. Even if you went the service rigs route, there are winches and pickers to do the heavy lifting, most of that macho shit is going away due to safety and injury concerns. Well testing has always been a bit dodgy though. They usually hire you as a contractor so they can drop you without renumeration should it slow down. At least that was my experience with well testing outfits in the past. Wireline work is a bit of a different one. For E-line work, you'd need to be fairly strong as the lubricators and tools are very heavy and are usually carried by hand, at least for set-up. Slickline is also some heavy lifting but not on the same scale. The tools are lighter. I did that for 8 years and it was a really good job for learning bottom hole well characteristics and tubular tool components.  
 Have you tried getting a well operator position at an oil company? It's not physically demanding work, but it is busy and you have to be a decent problem solver. That's the route I went 17 years or so ago when my first daughter was born. Best work schedule in the patch as far as I'm concerned.

"> Also the fact that employees don’t have a choice about whether they join or not.

Because once there is a collective agreement in place, in an environment where a union exists but not all employees are members, it would be very easy for the corporation to undermine it. 

This fact should be so obvious I'm not even going to bother giving you an example of how, because the only way someone could be unaware of it would be wilful ignorance.

"There no straight up benefit to taxes per say(100% of anything spent either way is fully tax write-off able for the employer) however there may be different expenses and financial benefits other than taxes

For CPP AND EI there is an employer's portion and an employee's portion.  If you are an employee your employer will deduct the CPP and EI from your cheque (the employees portion) and then match the CPP and 1.4x the EI and submit that total to the government.  If you are a contractor instead of an employee you have to pay both halves (the employer's and the employer's portion) to the CRA directly yourself and are ineligible for EI (so you don't make payments there).   

However as an contractor you can probably write off more expenses that are related to creating income including portions of your vehicle costs(insurance, gas, maint, etc), tools, supplies, training or software required and maybe a home office...  

And of course as a contractor you have the ability to work for multiple clients and can have more control over your schedule (in theory). But that comes at the cost of having few of the protections that employees have by law. For example they can end the contract(unless you know... The contract says otherwise) without notice whereas employees have minimum notice or severance in lieu of notice, access to EI, rules about Overtime, etc

"Exactly. I consider problem solving, processing information, logical deduction, and applying knowledge to be signs of intelligence. Other signs of intelligence could be a good memory, and mathematical skills.

Hosting a radio show, and being a good public speaker to me is a verbal skill but not related to intelligence, and some of the smartest people I have met have stutters, stumble verbally because their mind goes faster than their mouth. To crib from D&D it is a charisma skill, not an intelligence skill.

Being a fast on her feet when it comes to interviews could be a sign of intelligence, but from what I've seen of her, she comes out with the same textbook conservative responses every conservative does when asked questions, there really is no thinking involved there.

Considering that she falls for every tinfoil hat theory out there, her deductive skill, and intelligence are very low.

That being said, when people mistake being a good public speaker with intelligence, it is no wonder we end up with such shitty leaders.

"City, town or county you reside in.

Hinton 

Your age (20s,30s,40s,50s etc).

20s

What field do you work in? Are there jobs available in your area?

Transportation. Yes, every transportation company in the area is looking for as many class 1 drivers as they can get their hands on. It is an employees market and really tough to find people right now. 

Do you have kids? Would you recommend your area for people with kids?

No I do not. Yes, the area is great for kids. Lots of things for kids in town like dance, performing arts, hockey, skiing, hiking, camping, bike park, etc... Outside eof town is anything you desire outdoors-wise and the Jasper gates are 10 minutes away. 

Is your area pet/animal friendly?

Extremely pet friendly. Most households have dogs. There are more trails in hinton than any other community I have visited and lots are off leash and there are endless more trails that lead out of town to take the dog on. In the winter you can walk the golf course with the dog, or skate on some of the flooded trails by the town. 

How would you rate your area on transit accessibility?

Hinton has a fully operating transit program, which can be useful and is accessible, but a majority of people drive. There is also daily transit to Jasper, if you plan on going that way

How would you rate your area on drivability?

Difficult question to answer. The town of hinton is fine, although quite physically large for 10000 people. Driving east on 16 is fine, as it is twinned. Going north or soufh on 40 can be a really, really bad highway. Going west to Jasper is always a dangerous drive with the amount of tourists on the road. 

How would you rate the walkability?

How would you rate the affordability?

Affordability is definily hinton biggest downside. Wages are much higher than the provincial and national averages, but homes, groceries, rent, etc.. Are more expensive. 

What does your area offer in terms of hobbies and recreational services?

Mainly outdoor activities like mountain biking (largest free use park in Alberta), hiking, camping, quadding, sledding, fishing, etc... 

What is your favourite thing about your area?

Proximity to the mountains and bc as well as the bike park and boardwalk. Having gigabit fiber for over 5 years in town has also been really nice. 

What is your least favourite thing about your area?

It can get exceptionally busy with tourists which can be hard to handle, but they are integral to the economy.",t2_b4ftwc0a,boardwalk-throwaway,0,1648919368.0,0,t1_i34m0v0,i34m0v0,True,AutoModerator,t3_t9inik,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/t9inik/moving_to_alberta_megathread_march_2022/,Moving To Alberta Megathread - March 2022,/r/alberta/comments/t9inik/moving_to_alberta_megathread_march_2022/i34m0v0/,1,r/alberta,0,1

"I agree. I also think there is a significant component around communication that has created significant challenges. 

e.g. the use of the word ""restrictions"" instead of another less political word such as ""protections"". The use of the word ""mild"" when mild is very much relative, and depends on vaccination status (to a large degree). 

Science and messaging changing and evolving is a difficult thing to communicate well, because people get anchored to the earlier advice (e.g. 2m distance is sufficient). 

There's a lack of trust that gets involved, especially when politicians interfere (or shield) with public health recommendations under cabinet confidence.

"It seems to me that Covid has become a political disease. Public health protocols & restrictions have polarized us politically, based on whether we agree or disagree with them, and governments at all levels have put political considerations above scientific in deciding how to respond.

Now, it’s not considered politically expedient to respond at all, it seems. In provinces with right wing governments, where their supporters are overwhelmingly anti-vaxx, anti mask, anti-restrictions, it’s a bad move to even count cases, deaths & hospitalizations on the off-chance the numbers will be perceived as “bad” and the government forced to act. It’s not that they don’t understand the concepts of exponential growth or lag times, it’s just not in the government’s political best interests to do anything but watch people die.",t2_9ngdb,3rddog,0,1648912679.0,0,t1_i346yej,i346yej,False,Patient-Yesterday-10,t3_tu21mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/tu21mo/alberta_covid19_wastewater_trends_apr_1st/,Alberta COVID19 Wastewater Trends - Apr 1st,/r/alberta/comments/tu21mo/alberta_covid19_wastewater_trends_apr_1st/i346yej/,5,r/alberta,0,5

"Definitely. And I do think that the government mandating EV sales will actually help spur investment into infrastructure to support EV. It’s that positive feedback loop which can be hard to get kicked off, but once it’s rolling can happen very fast. When it comes to EV, we are going to see amazing growth and adoption in most modern nations. I’m a fan to be honest. That being said, we have to invest billions in upgrading infrastructure, not just charging stations, but actual upgrades in cabling. Modern subs aren’t designed for the coming increased in electrical load. They can be, but again not without significant investment, which also means we are all going to pay even more for energy. Think bills are high now? Just wait. Also, one thing I am struggling to understand, is how we produce the power needed to take on all the additional load coming from EVs. Maybe, just maybe the additional power can be produced by renewables. But then we are still stuck with our existing power load. No way renewables can take on both additional demand from EVs AND current base load. It’s going to take massive investment in both renewables, CCS, and growing production of O&G to make all this happen. Which again, means our utility bills are going to go up. A lot. But also again, that’s just Canada. What about India? Or Pakistan? Or many south Asian blocs? Will the populous poorer nations make these investments into renewables? Or will they continue their expansion from cheap O&G? I believe modern nations can achieve significant reduction in emissions, at significant expense. I also believe poorer nations will simply pick up the cheaper O&G to grow and our global emissions will stay the same, or probably even rise.

"I agree; and we're just starting to get into the 2-3 week window from when this trend started upward.

The +8 increase in hospitalizations week over week was an indication that we may be seeing the start of an increase in Monday's hospitalization numbers, I expect if we had numbers from Friday we may already be seeing an increase (but sadly those numbers aren't public anymore until Wednesday).

It's a weird gamble we (UCP) play every time: we get on an exponential growth trend, and then we decide that we'll wait until our healthcare system is under severe pressure before we take action. The risk balance is so bizarre... We end up risking more lives, we risk the need for more stringent public health measures, and we end up putting more people in hospital... And then it takes months for the situation to normalize. 

Now, at some point this will reach endemic status where we can manage it more easily, and while I can understand the desire to test this by entirely removing restrictions - when evidence suggests the contrary, we are SO bloody slow at reacting to limit loss of life (& other negative impacts)...",t2_7q7tukln,Patient-Yesterday-10,0,1648910624.0,0,t1_i342ivw,i342ivw,False,Patient-Yesterday-10,t3_tu21mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/tu21mo/alberta_covid19_wastewater_trends_apr_1st/,Alberta COVID19 Wastewater Trends - Apr 1st,/r/alberta/comments/tu21mo/alberta_covid19_wastewater_trends_apr_1st/i342ivw/,3,r/alberta,0,3

"(not the person you're responding to, but) I take allergy meds daily (and change them out every 3 days so my liver doesn't clear them) and I've still gotten extremely mild intermittent sore throats very frequently throughout the pandemic -- not like ""wow definitely got a sore throat"" but like ""Hmm the air's dry and maybe I slept with my mouth open?"" Sore throat where like once every 20 mins I get a twinge. something I would not have paid any attention to whatsoever before COVID. Husband sometimes feels the same way. Like I would almost go so far as to say it could easily be psychosomatic.

In December we were both feeling like that so we got PCR tested, he was negative I was positive. He kept doing rapid tests because this is when the rules changed, including throat swabs, never became positive. My sore throat never got any worse, was always just at ""air's dry"" barely noticeable level. In discussion with the nurse, since it never changed and lingering very mild sore throat isn't a COVID symptom*, he said it was possible I just had asymptomatic COVID plus the random sore throat nonsense.

So while stay home when you're sick is clearly the best policy, I can definitely understand it being difficult to draw the line between what's sick and what's not, especially when the govn't isn't giving us much help making the decision. I don't know what OP's sore throat felt like, but if it was anything like the nonsense mine's been doing, I get it.
