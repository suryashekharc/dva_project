"Technically speaking, Roanoke has not ""grown"" since the 70's. It was about 95-100k residents then, and still is now. Downtown is far more active than it used to be though. Drinking is a big thing here. Restaurants are pretty good, though not as many choices as where I moved back here from.

Lack of decent paying jobs is the big problem. There is no real tech sector, manufacturing has gone downhill, engineering (what brought my family here in the 70's) as well. Even the railroad laid off people. They were supposed to connect I-581 to I-73 in Greensboro, NC, but I guess that never materialized.

"I live near Hollins.  I think long term they are going to create more trails and link into Carvins Cove.  There’s already a trail on the north side of the interstate (the tinker creek greenway) that goes into Carvins Cove. 

The county built that paved trail from the corner of Plantation and Williamson up to the interstate that is part of that plan.  The problem is that there’s not really anything at the Plantation/Williamson intersection to use the trail right now.  It’s all basically commercial. I think the hope is to build some mixed use stuff in that area.

"I lived in Eugene, Oregon for quite awhile. Roanoke reminds me A LOT of Eugene.

Google images of both cities and you'll be amazed at how similar they look. Both cities are in a valley surrounded by mountains, both have a lot of trees, both are roughly the same size (Eugene has 60,000 more people, I think), both have a larger metro population when surrounding areas are included, both have some funky business zoning and growing pains, both are a few hours' drive to a bigger city, both have hippies and outdoor enthusiasts, both have people who drive pick up trucks and go fishing on weekends, both have a university presence (UO vs VT), both have a fun, compact downtown with stuff to do, both have a well-defined, somewhat quirky sense of community spirit, both make for an easy, laid-back lifestyle from day to day. Before you know it, you've been there for ten years and it's been good.

Summers are way more humid in Roanoke, though, and we do not have a Trader Joe's yet in Roanoke. It also rains a lot more in Eugene, although we get enough to keep things green.

"There were raves going on literally everywhere in the US, and it was kind of like the Wild West, tons of MDMA (and everything else), and they were being held all kinds of places you wouldn't expect. I went to some in the middle of nowhere in WV and NC, I went to one in a dark field in Blacksburg (it got shut down, someone cut the power to the whole party and all the tents), etc. 

What the Rave Act did was make it so at any party like this, drugs would be the responsibility of the promoter, so if there were drugs IN the venue the whole place would be considered a crackhouse, and they would charge the promoter with multiple felonies. Things slowed down considerably after that and things went back to just being the occasional small event at a hole in the wall restaurant or tamer sanctioned events at pre-existing clubs (instead of rented warehouses).  

[I just looked it up](https://amendtheraveact.org/), coincidentally Joe Biden is who introduced it, thanks Biden!

"I find myself looking more into the butter/dipping accoutrements.  It's irrational, but I'm annoyed when ""fancier"" places serve bread with cold food service pats of butter.

I had bread at Local Roots, but it came with my salad.  Their butter was tasty.

We somehow ended up with a bowl of biscuits and muffins at Cracker Barrel.  I thought it was a menu item, but we didn't get charged.

I haven't been in a long while but I feel like I've had bread at Carlos and maybe Billy's for dinner, because they do the wire-basket/napkin serve.  Definitely Billy's because I was annoyed at the cold pats of butter.

O'Charley's, where ever they may be open.  Same for Ruby Tuesday.  And similarly, Red Lobster has those cheddar biscuits.

(As much as I like Mexican food, the free chips irritate me because everyone crunches them like they're auditioning for a Doritos commercial)

Every once in a while I'll see a studio go up for around that range, and then a lot of them have a utilities and cable package for somewhere around $150 or so.

"> It's opioids and addiction issues.

* Lack of access to affordable/quality healthcare--including mental & reproductive health--that supports various belief systems as well as agnostic viewpoints
* Lack of access to quality education options

Which is why the concerns I cited address a proactive approach rather than the reactive examples you cited. Unfortunately both are necessary and the trend toward the visible and reactive solutions will only continue with less public services receiving funding/support.  

I also acknowleged that these concerns aren't unique to Roanoke... With that said, I'm not sure you're looking at the comparison of NY to VA objectively. NY has a higher population density than VA as well as a higher COL so you'd see higher numbers across the board. 

I grew up in this area hearing these arguments. I also took them at face value when I was younger, had less life-experience, and hadn't been exposed to other narraitives. My **personal** experience has been that it's easier for scared, uninformed, and entitled people to blame individuals--including children--for the culmination of things outside of their control than address the barriers that I listed in my original response. 

With that said, I thank you for sharing your perspective. I'm happy to agree to disagree on this and if you are open to learning more, other people talk about their personal experiences in povertyfinance.

"All local school districts are already under way hiring for the upcoming school year.

FWIW, Roanoke City is going to have the highest pay scale for next school year. Currently, Salem does, but that’ll change unless they also approved as significant pay raises (not sure.)

I have friends who work for Roanoke City and really like it. There are many folks who refuse to work for the city again, but that was under a different superintendent. There’s been a big culture shift with the new administration. 

Working in the city does have challenges in other ways, as there are more students who have tough home life situations, discipline issues, etc. But at the same time, a lot of the surrounding districts have conservative school boards, so given everything going on currently with education, that would make me nervous.

I think at the end of the day, there are always going to be people who love or hate a certain district depending on their school, the principal, etc. I know some teachers who love the city, others who swear by RoCo, others who say the county is worse than the city, etc.",t2_7z4umcv2,electrical_yak_,0,1648423965.0,0,t1_i2dgctp,i2dgctp,True,projecthonesty,t3_tpssz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tpssz8/when_do_the_city_of_roanoke_teaching_jobs_post/,When do the City of Roanoke teaching jobs post?,/r/roanoke/comments/tpssz8/when_do_the_city_of_roanoke_teaching_jobs_post/i2dgctp/,7,r/roanoke,0,7

">a large lot directly behind the colab building shared with the co-op

The parking directly adjacent to the Co-Op (like the section you drive through from Grandin Rd) is owned by Co-Op.  They do occasionally have a security guy who presumably might call towing if a car is parked there too long.

The parking beyond directly beyond that is owned by the Virginia Heights Baptist Church.

The parking behind CoLab is owned by the same company that owns the building CoLab is in, Commonwealth Partners LLC.

"Thanks for chiming in! Love hearing the different points of view!

Public Domain is dope! Stumptown is still good but jumped the shark some years ago. Blue Star is a donut place; they got coffee, but I wouldn't put it in this type of discuss (that's just me, lol). 

Sweet Donkey has always been great when I've been there. I'll admit I'm no coffee snob or whatever, but I got really accustomed to tasting great coffee all the time while living in Portland for over 10 years. I knew plenty of coffee snobs and drank plenty of top-end coffee that they respected (Deadstock, Barista, and Sterling cafes stand out), including with a buddy who has an incredibly precise pallet to the point he was the lead bean buyer for Stumptown for years because of how spot on his taste buds are. So I'm not a coffee snob and will often drink whatever, but I know what great coffee tastes like (or is supposed to taste like), if that makes sense. All that being said, SD noticeably tastes more like what would be ""good coffee"" in Portland than RND.

**ADDED:** I see you added some price info - cool! I haven't been to Stumptown in years due to the BS they were doing and going through a while ago, but they're controlled by a company out of NYC, so it wouldn't surprise me if their prices were being set artificially high and/or were being raised because less people go there then 10+ years ago before their ""coolness"" in the city fell (*ex: many brunch spots all stopped carrying their coffee, so that revenue stream has dried up*).",t2_oml3b,WinesburgOhio,0,1648212521.0,0,t1_i224gnh,i224gnh,False,ownseagls,t3_tmve27,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tmve27/coffee_culture/,Coffee culture,/r/roanoke/comments/tmve27/coffee_culture/i224gnh/,2,r/roanoke,0,2
"I respectfully disagree. Sweet Donkey always tastes REALLY acidic to me, and their flavors are the same generic flavors you can get at any coffee shop. I do love the vibe of that place though. I don't think Sweet Donkey would even get looked at compared to Public Domain, Stumptown, or Blue Star tbh, it's simply not as good and the flavors aren't exciting.

RND would though, because their seasonal flavors offer a unique experience and overall the food their is pretty next level for a coffee shop.

All that said I don't think there is any coffee shop in the world that could peel me away from Public Domain.

"Coffee culture and quality in Roanoke isn’t that great tbh. I worked in the coffee industry for 5ish years. 4 in Roanoke, 1 in Charlottesville.

Sweet donkey is a cool place and has capable baristas, but I personally don’t like the roasts they have that much. Their espresso drinks are pretty good though!

Mill mountain sucks, it’s really over roasted and a lot of their beans smell styrophoamy. Their baristas are paid minimum wage and are completely untrained. Expect really shitty coffee and drinks from there. 

I’ve heard good things about RND but I haven’t tried it since I quit coffee 😅

Unfortunately, most other coffee places in Roanoke are staffed by people that have 0 clue what they’re doing and don’t get paid enough to care. The largest coffee house going demographic in Roanoke is old dudes who’ve smoked too much and can’t taste what they’re drinking. The apathy is real, there isn’t demand for quality stuff here because people think what they have is good enough.

It’s the same thing with food, and it gets worse the further southwest you go. For example, in the Pulaski/Blacksburg area everyone thinks “Sal’s” is the best goddamn Italian food they’ve ever had in their lives. I had co workers cheer for the day the company bought us fucking sal’s. That shit was the most disgusting Italian food I’ve ever eaten 😂 0/10. They just don’t know, because they’ve never tried anything better.

I will say though, Champloo Bubble tea and ice cream is some of the best bubble tea on the east coast.

"> We love it here but we know our time is limited. Housing prices have gone crazy and overall cost of living is way to much. We both have good jobs and we are barely making it work. Also, we have really struggled to find a community here because it is so transit. We are exploring options of places to move and Roanoke has moved to the top of the list. We really enjoy paddle boarding, hiking, backpacking, mtn biking and road biking. I will say the best thing about living where we live is that we can easily leave our home and hop on a trail to bike or hike without driving. We also love going out to restaurants and brewery’s when we can. From what I have read it seems that Roanoke offers a lot of those things. Any feedback would be really helpful!! We are just trying to understand the place a bit.

"Not yet.  Maybe in 5-10 years.

One of the reasons IPv6 is being deployed (and also why CGNAT - Carrier Grade Network Address Translation is used) is because the world is running out of IPv4 addresses.  If you remember the Y2K debacle where dates were going to run out of digits - ipv4 has a similar issue.  There are only about 4 billion possible IPv4 addresses and since the rollout of Internet Of Things (IoT) devices, a smart phone in every pocket, multiple computers per household, etc, we are quickly running out.

An IPv4 address is x.x.x.x where each x represents a number from 0 to 255, so 256 total possible numbers in each block.  256x256x256x256 = 4,294,967,296 possible numbers.

Some of the issue is resolved by using a router in your home that only consumes a single IP and allowing all the devices in your home (Local Area Network) to have a special private IP address (usually starting with 192.x.x.x, sometimes with 10.x.x.x or 172.x.x.x).  Your router can determine what traffic belongs to which device and send the data to the right place.  This is called Network Address Translation or NAT.

Some ISPs (like GloFiber in their default setup) use 'CGNAT"" or Carrier Grade NAT.  Basically, they have their own set of IP addresses that they 'own' and can operate on and for all the customers who don't need public/external IPs, they do their own form of NAT to stretch out how many external IPs they consume.  The issue is if you have things like IP Security cameras or your own web server, you won't be able to get an ISP to forward all that type of traffic to you so your router can get it to your device.  Many ISPs are happy to set up customers who request it with an external IP address (sometimes at a fee, sometimes for no charge).

Eventually, even CGNAT won't be enough to keep up and we'll just need more addresses.  That's where IPv6 comes in.  Instead of only 32bits of data (giving us that 4.294 billion possible IPv4 addresses), IPv6 is 128bit and can therefore have 340 undecillion (thats 340 with 36 more zeros after it) different addresses.  Those will never run out.

But right now, no common applications require IPv6.  Many support and can make use of it but since so many ISPs don't yet support IPv6, game and app developers are not building their apps to only use it.",t2_4nw00,nhluhr,0,1648139349.0,0,t1_i1y5sn7,i1y5sn7,False,skadeda,t3_tlbu8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tlbu8i/is_glo_fiber_more_reliable_than_cox/,Is Glo Fiber more reliable than Cox?,/r/roanoke/comments/tlbu8i/is_glo_fiber_more_reliable_than_cox/i1y5sn7/,2,r/roanoke,0,2

"We have had GloFiber for almost 1 year.  We are in Salem, so we previously had Xfinity at this house, but have also previously used Cox at another house.  We are absolutely in love with Glofiber.  We have lost connection 2x.  Once was late at night (midnight), so didn't bother us much.

Right before switching, we had the TV package with Xfinity.  When we switched, we just went to streaming (Netflix, Prime, Hulu, Discovery Plus, and Frndly).  We are VERY content with what we have to watch.

"Public transit only goes to certain areas and most people in and around the city travel to and from the outskirts anyway. This is where people get it all wrong to compare the USA vs other countries that are as small as most states.

We shouldn't look at the weapon of choice we should be addressing mental health and most of that comes from economic needs. We don't need to be giving free rides or hand outs either to combat this.

"Hey, I work with a lot of people with food instability. So here's a few I take them to and what I've learned about them. I'm not 100% sure of economic restrictions as most people I work with meet the criteria. Most just ask for IDs. 

Christian soldiers: parking on the street but its generally pretty open. They just need your ID. Open tuesday-saturday from 10-12 I do believe. You can go once a week. 

Rosalind hills: drive through food pantry with a clothes closet. There is parking. They are only open on Mondays and Thursdays though. They generally just ask for your name, amount of people in your household.

Catholic Charities (st. Francis house): they ask for your address and how many in your household. Open monday-friday until noon I do believe. They do have a parking lot. 

It also depends on where you live, but Salem has a food pantry as do most counties. The rescue mission also has a food pantry but I don't know much about it.

Literally just arrived in Roanoke from Arizona yesterday. We are trail runners and mountain bikers and wanted to escape the heat and insane growth of AZ. We chose Roanoke for the reasons you mention. We haven’t experienced the humidity and we assume it will take time to adjust to from the dry desert but I’m so ready for seasons and a different type of people. I am so blown away at the friendliness we are experiencing all ready. We opted for the Hollins area mostly for its quick access to places like Carvins Cove and the AT as well as because it’s a bit more diverse than some of the other suburbs in the south county.,t2_d4h7hpp3,Becoming_wilder,0,1647821542.0,0,t1_i1gxonx,i1gxonx,True,CallMeD1234,t3_tiesc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tiesc9/should_i_move_to_roanoke/,Should I move to Roanoke?,/r/roanoke/comments/tiesc9/should_i_move_to_roanoke/i1gxonx/,3,r/roanoke,0,3

This argument is so tired. Gang violence is violence. Just because you can afford to move out of the dangerous neighborhoods doesn't mean other innocent people can. Stray bullets are real. Violent people can get angry with you for the smallest perceived threat and escalate. It is a source of great fear and stress for many people.
