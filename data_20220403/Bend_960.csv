"As a person who has lived in both Portland and in different places in Central Oregon including Bend, plus has also had to spend nights in my car I feel like jumping in on this conversation. Around 10 years ago I stopped helping the homeless. I was that person that brought dog food, treats, bedding and other animal supplies to homeless camps tucked back in blm, and to those that sat at intersections. I worked with dogs (mostly) for years and tended to have leftover supplies from work or from my personal efforts to foster and wanted to share. I lost my heart for these efforts after almost always being refused the offerings, money was the most requested item, but I didn’t have much to my name. Honestly I mostly just had animal food and a strong desire to help to offer. I often, almost every time I went back to blm, was threatened with rape or robbery, luckily my dogs always protected me. But It was absolutely disheartening. I’m not saying that every homeless person is like this (!!), but enough that I stopped my efforts. And as I said, I too have had to sleep in my car, life is not easy. I didn’t have the support that is now offered to many of the homeless. I was alone and struggling with basic supplies. It drove me in a personal desire to better my situation. Today I see homeless with brand new Specialized brand bikes, Columbia brand camping gear, Patagonia brand coats, and etc. things that even now in my more comfortable years I could never afford. Frankly Bend is very welcoming, friendly and supportive to the homeless, much more than Portland is even, spend any amount of time talking with people in this position in Bend and from Portland and they will tell you. I don’t think the homeless have life easy, but I think the overwhelming amount of support and donations they received aid some people in not having that personal drive to step away from homeless life and strive to better their situation. This safe haven mentally,I personally think, is driving more homeless to the area but not providing the opportunity and drive to step outside that lifestyle. Please tell me how wrong I am. I know this is not a popular opinion. But as someone who has been there, worked with, and tried to help out the homeless it is my PERSONAL opinion.",t2_4fuupyq6,sinopa82,0,1649007394.0,0,t1_i38wip5,i38wip5,True,arrriah,t3_tut0hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/tut0hc/look_i_am_very_giving_to_the_local_house_less_and/,Look I am very giving to the local house less and I will always be however....,/r/Bend/comments/tut0hc/look_i_am_very_giving_to_the_local_house_less_and/i38wip5/,3,r/Bend,0,3

""Forestland"" means any woodland, brushland, timberland, grazing land or clearing that, during any time of the year, contains enough forest growth, slashing or vegetation to constitute, in the judgment of the forester, a fire hazard, regardless of how the land is zoned or taxed.""

"Not sure the issue you are having but try Bobcat and Sun, Inc. 541-389-7365.

 They installed our solar hot water system years ago. We dismantled it because of a remodel, but when it was there it would heat the city water in a big blue tank, which would then feed in to our electric water heater. Basically preheating the input water. It still worked after 20 years. The heat exchanger (Grumman) has a big Bobcat and sun sticker on it.

Edit: read your post closer and see you think it is an issue with the gas in the demand heater - not sure if Bobcat can help but keep them in mind for all the solar stuff at least.",t2_2jhhge4s,Username-is-random,0,1648925306.0,0,t1_i34zabp,i34zabp,True,athey,t3_tufqq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/tufqq5/plumber_hvac_recommendations/,Plumber / hvac recommendations?,/r/Bend/comments/tufqq5/plumber_hvac_recommendations/i34zabp/,2,r/Bend,0,2

"I refuse to support this establishment. I actually worked there for about a week. I was hired on the spot without much discussion. When I asked if I should email him my resume, I was told that it isn't necessary. 

The following day, I was sent the employee manual and kind of disappointed to learn that they charge their employees (50% discount)  for an employee meal. I have worked in restaurants for around  20 years and have never had to pay for a meal while I worked. 

It is quite the opposite at good restaurants. In fact, on my first day at Broken Top Club, Chef Paul Ellis encouraged me to try everything and was constantly saying, ""try this!"".

I can't count how many times I brought home hotel pans full of leftovers to let my neighbors experience the flavors. Hell, why should food go to waste?

OK, back to Life and Time... about a week after I started, a customer canceled their to go order that had just finished being prepared. That's when I learned that their policy is to throw perfectly good food in the trash instead of feeding it to their underpaid employees. The reason was to prevent employees from intentionally messing up orders to get free food. 

Reatraunts have so much food waste that it is unnecessary to have policies like this. Feed your employees. Make them love the food they are preparing and encourage them to experiment with the available ingredients to create new items. This is how innovation and loyalty flourish.

Life and Time is promoting itself as a healthy lifestyle restaurant. Healthy lifestyle begins with the way you treat your team and how much joy everybody has while working together.  People before profits. This place is founded on greed. An extra $3-4 dollars a day in food cost per employee is going to make them better workers for your company. You can literally nourish a better employee for next to nothing. 

I hope that the owners read this and have some serious discussion about their wasteful practices and relationship with staff. I left the same day the food went in the trash. Plus I never tried your food after working their a week?  How am I supposed to promote your product via word of mouth if I am supposed to pay for the product samples? Also, you should know that black beans are being cooked a hotel pan at a time and immediately frozen. This is a sign you are cooking too many beans. The freeze/thaw process alters the cellular structure and thus the taste of the frozen product. Fresh is best!

Sorry for the rant guys. I am passionate about food and have owned two businesses. This is not the way.

Hey, chef Paul, if this gets in front of your eyes, I loved my experience there. I am the guy that pitched a tent out back during the eclipse. I was not in a good place then. I am sorry for that. I am in a better place now. If you ever need a spare pair of hands, let me know. I will even do dishes just to get my foot in the door.

"> This entire thread is a red herring. A lot of these comments are unfair and show a lack of understanding of the Deschutes basin and Oregon water laws in general.

Totally agree. There's just such a tremendous deficit of knowledge here about how water use, water regulation, and water distribution in the Deschutes Basin work. This rage is totally misdirected. The irrigation districts using over 90 percent of the water in the basin to produce net negative farm income, who just got 100s of millions in taxpayer subsidies for their millionaire (and billionaire!) patrons are thrilled with the misdirection.

Does Verheyden’s property abut the proposed route?

"Here is a brief history of the issue.

Verheydens attorney claimed that a 17 year old [Deschutes Co. land use decision](https://www.dropbox.com/s/et6dc35n4t46se2/2021_04_26%20Notice%20of%20Gate%20Closure.pdf?dl=0) gives him the legal right to gate the road and even ""requires"" it.

The [Forest Service wrote back](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w1ewyu650hpcz0d/2021_05_07%20ltr%20USFS%20to%20Verheyden%20Keeling%20%28redacted%29.pdf?dl=0) and said, ""...it could not nullify Federal property rights...""

However, later upon further review the [USFS wrote,](https://www.dropbox.com/s/isay58q4mg68agw/2021_08_12%20ltr%20USFS%20to%20Verheyden%20Keeling%20Garcia.pdf?dl=0) ""the agency holds a valid easement on FR 4606 where the southernmost of your three gates is presently located."" and then went on to say, ""Forest Service interests are insufficiently clear."" at the other two gate locations.

""Insufficiently clear"" does not mean that the USFS doesn’t have a valid easement or Right-Of-Way.  The Forest Service has not been forthcoming in exactly what or where the problem is.

This is a common problem and the [Forest Service Manual (FSM)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sge1w1ix24ys079/2022_01_15%20FSM.pdf?dl=0) addresses Right-Of-Way issues in detail.  Section 5460.2 (4) of the FSM  says, “**When records indicate that an existing NFS road or trail lacks a proper right-of-way, the necessary right-of-way must be acquired as soon as practicable.**

I don’t know why the Forest Service is not following the manual and acquiring the Right-Of-Way like their manual directs them to.  The  Forest Service could maybe start [prescriptive easement action](https://www.findlaw.com/realestate/land-use-laws/prescriptive-easements.html) since the road has been open for decades if not a century.

FYI, the southernmost gate is generally locked after business hours.  The Forest Service has been notified numerous times and has taken no visible action..  Also, if the Land Use Decision ""requires"" Verheyden to lock the gates then why is the southernmost gate generally open business hours only?

**Opinion - We're being forced to detour and pay up to $700,000 for a new road so  some multi millionaire can rent out** [**Airbnb's**](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/50193998?adults=1&source_impression_id=p3_1631664339_l3RlATm%2FfSh1LHwL&guests=1&check_in=2022-06-24&check_out=2022-06-26) **for up to nearly $1,000 a night and float around on his permitted 2 acre private pond using our water.  Sorry, that's total BS.  The Forest Service needs to take legal action or explain why it can't.  Not just pass the buck down to the Deschutes County.**

"Upvoted because I agree with much of what you’re saying in principal.

However, there are plenty of scalpers that just use bots normally and don’t work with the devil itself.
There are also plenty of normal fans who get tickets. Fans who use artist presale codes, who are subscribed to mailing lists, etc. or who just buy during the normal on sale.
If you look at a map when tickets go on sale for a seated show, you’ll see most seats are released normally barring any artist VIP and stuff. I bought Train tickets via presale and got great seats, and checked during on sale and many many seats in the front were released to the public. There are still many great seats available because it’s not as popular of a show. I’d be interested to see where you get your numbers for “small percentage” that actually go on sale. 

A more popular show will sell more and faster. If people didn’t buy scalpers tickets, and if they didn’t buy Ticketmaster platinum, the tickets would be sold for less money. But, someone is willing to pay those prices. So, Ticketmaster and scalpers both take advantage of that. 

I’ve been to hundreds of concerts and have been going for over ten years. Adding in Ticketmaster platinum hasn’t changed that much, if anything at all. Scalpers and bots have always been more frustrating; seeing the entire first three rows become available and suddenly pulled within a second. That’s not a bunch of people, that’s bots. 

Again, I hate Ticketmaster, I know the history of all of their bullshit and lawsuits.

"Erica at Kind Canine. https://www.thekindcaninepetservices.com/ happy to DM you some detailed notes on why

One note as you’re looking at trainers: there are many whose answer to dog training is “submission due to fear of violence”, and I think that’s a bullshit, regressive approach. Seemed like the mainstay of “trainer bro dude who’s been doing this For A Long Time” (and be ready for “how dare you question my methods” if you ask them to break down “how does this work? What feedback loops does this teach?”)

A red flag for us as we worked with our blue heeler (a very smart and very nippy breed) to find a trainer was “oh an ecollar will fix what you’re dealing with.” He’s been 100x more fun and happy and obedient with operant conditioning than any amount of thrown objects (I shit you not) and ecollars.",t2_9utd36pe,DoubtfulAmbivalence,0,1648828202.0,0,t1_i2zvvvk,i2zvvvk,True,Iupvoteanimals,t3_ttqjh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/ttqjh9/in_search_of_a_dog_trainer_experienced_with_gsds/,In search of a dog trainer experienced with GSD's,/r/Bend/comments/ttqjh9/in_search_of_a_dog_trainer_experienced_with_gsds/i2zvvvk/,9,r/Bend,0,9

Also, the quantity of water here is miniscule compared to the bigger picture of water use throughout our watershed.

We then filed a [Anti-SLAPP motion](https://www.rcfp.org/anti-slapp-guide/oregon/) making the case that this suit was just to keep us from speaking up about an issue of public concern and has no merit. One of the issues that cropped up was how Oregon treats media vs. non-media defendants in defamation cases.

It turns out that there is a case pending in front of the Oregon Supreme Court that is going to hopefully decide that.  We advised the court of the pending case and the judge suggested waiting 180 days for the Supreme Court decision.  Verheydens attorneys are opposed to this and want to start limited discovery. 

The bar is really high to win an Anti-SLAPP motion because the judge is tossing the case out and not allowing a trial. If we lose we go to trial, win and the case is dismissed. Either party can also appeal.

The case that is of interest to ours is [Tom Lowell v. Matthew Wright](https://web.courts.oregon.gov/records/sccalendar.nsf/b29dd44d01dffea088256c91005b3a5b/7c97142da97573fa882586b2007cd80e?OpenDocument) This is a case about a guy in the piano business who wrote a nasty on-line review on another piano store in Medford.

"> A local resident requested a permit to pump 14 garden hoses worth of water.

FTFY


Two wells @ .24 cfs

.24 cfs = 107 gpm

A good garden hose can do around 15 gpm.

One well is ~7 hoses worth of water, so 14 in total.

This isn't 14 hoses running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is an over-estimation of the water that will actually be used/needed because that's how permit applications work.

If they were planning on running those 14 garden hoses wide open 24/7, they would meet their maximum annual volume (9 acre feet) in less than 10 days.

"James Verheyden is a piece of shit. Assuming he's the same James Verheyden that works as a hand surgeon at St. Charles (how common can that name be?) he's the least compassionate doctor I've ever had the displeasure of working with.

 I had a very simple procedure on an intensely painful finger and he showed zero interest in how my pain was managed from start to finish. During consult he pressed unreasonably hard to localize the source of pain (it was obvious visually, on light palpation, and I described in full detail where the pain was and how much it hurt) not once but twice. 

During procedure my hand was numbed and he left for 20 minutes, and when the anesthetic was wearing off he tried to tell me that the pain I was experiencing didn't exist as if I were trying to get a free injection (because obviously I was craving another needle in my hand). After a brief argument, his assistant offered to re-dose my surgical hand with anesthetic.

To which Dr. Verheyden angrily injected my hand but didn't even give the whole injection, rather squirting it onto my hand as asking angrily if I felt it. Yes, fucker, I can still feel wetness on my hand even with an anesthetic. So I ended up feeling everything from incision to having ~3 inches of surgical packing stuffed into my thumb. And the cherry on top, I received no pain meds until I begged the front desk to make a request.

Made a formal complaint at St. Charles and they took it very seriously and the reaction when I told them who the doctor was told me this was not his first complaint.

Point being, this man is not compassionate, he is not looking after the needs or goals of anyone in Bend but himself and his property.

I hope you succeed in your legal battle and hope he gets fucked, people like James Verheyden need a taste of reality sometimes.

"Hey u/OriginalPNWest, did you see this from OHA today? Apparently they are no longer doing press releases, meaning we may not get our data or at least I won't have my death info readily available to provide more detail to your base numbers. I may end of April 4 and just do a two-year recap....

Oregon Health Authority (OHA) will stop distributing a daily media release about COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths (including individual death summaries), effective Monday, April 4. Daily information about new COVID-19 cases, current hospitalizations of COVID-19 positive patients and deaths, along with other COVID-19 data, will continue to be available daily on the OHA website, data dashboards and social media platforms.  
  
The daily media releases grew out of the urgent need to communicate quickly evolving COVID-19 trends early in the pandemic. The news releases were sent to media partners seven days a week, including holidays, until July 2021, when the agency switched to weekday distribution.  
  
Now, as cases and hospitalizations have declined following a surge due to Omicron, and the public has the knowledge and tools to protect themselves, OHA is again adapting to the pandemic.  
  
The change in the cadence of media releases does not mean the pandemic is over. OHA will continue to monitor and report cases, deaths, hospitalizations, variants, vaccination and booster rates, and other developments. These monitoring efforts include analyzing wastewater samples across the state to track COVID-19 spread.  
  
Since the early days of OHA’s COVID-19 reporting, the daily media release has included information about every person in Oregon who has died with COVID-19. While these summaries recognized those we lost, the shift in reporting will better capture trends over time as Oregon moves into the next phase of the pandemic.  
  
Effective Monday, April 4, OHA will post the following information every business day on OHA’s COVID-19 website, and on Twitter, Facebook and OHA Facebook en Espanol:  
  
Newly reported COVID-19 cases  
Total COVID-19 cases  
Newly reported deaths with COVID-19  
Total deaths with COVID-19  
New hospitalizations of COVID-19 positive patients  
Total current hospitalizations of COVID-19 positive patients.  
In addition, OHA will publish a new data dashboard daily, highlighting data from several sources that monitor for COVID-19, trends and links to related dashboards for more detailed information.

"AS was the only airline that flew RDM-PDX in recent years (UA Express did in the distant past, and Boutique  Air offered flights on a PC-12 for a little while; see https://ktvz.com/community/community-billboard/2020/10/12/boutique-air-to-begin-daily-redmond-portland-flights-this-week/ )

AS started the CA flights (LAX, SFO) long before they cut back PDX during the pandemic. And they don’t fly to SLC from RDM (Delta does), so don’t think that impacted PDX.

The problem seems to be that 

(a) AS wants to consolidate connecting traffic at SEA to fill planes and maintain gate allocations

(b) AS doesn’t actually have enough pilots to operate all their Horizon flights.  They announced that by end of next year all Q400 turboprops will go away.  Some of them will be replaced by E75 jets, but their overall regional fleet will still be down by 30% or so.

"As few tips on doing the swim in open water in triathlon in general: 1) If swimming is not your strength, sit back and wait until all the fast swimmers have taken off. It's usually madness at the start, with tons of people thrashing around, swimming into and over each other etc....if you have no chance of crossing the finish line first anyway, it's better to avoid this. Once this is over, the field is much more stretched out and you can pass people later on in the bike and run. Hanging back for the swim shouldn't hurt your time since usually your timing chip does not start running until you cross the start gate  2) Practice swimming in the actual river. Swimming in open water (which will be murky and full of people for the triathlon) is quite different and you'll need to hold your head up higher to see where you are going than in a calm pool with lines and clear water. 3) Consider wearing some type of water shoe or sock. In the summer, there's a bunch of morons with glass bottles on the river and some end up on the bottom, plus there's old mining equipment. It happens all the time that people cut there feet during the open swim (at other triathlons, not sure about this one) and then the rest of the race is toast.
