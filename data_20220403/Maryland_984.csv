"Sorry if this is spam, but we at r/AmericanFlagInPlace are trying to maintain a US flag in the r/Place canvas. Unfortunately, it's crazy difficult because Reddit has a a large amount of both foreign and local groups who really hate America and American citizens in general, sometimes to bigotry levels. There's also a large contingent of 4channer who hate trans people and Americans (for being ""mixed breed"", ugh) and raid constantly. They basically spam out flag at 480 with random black specks or phallic graffiti.

We need some serious help fighting back. We have a discord pinned in our sub that you can join and help out with. Keep in mind that we have a peace treaty with Turkey, the UK, the LGBTQ vertical rainbow, and the r/Transplace flag. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying, so don't expand into those spaces. Were open to many different groups as long as youre not bigoted, attempting to brigade, or actively rude to friendly users.

"Alcohol has taste, local breweries have atmosphere, they become local hangout spots. The two industries really aren‚Äôt comparable more than both being drugs. 

I‚Äôm in favor of unlimited licenses because I think it‚Äôs best for the consumer and diminishes the opportunity for corruption. But it does stretch the market out so thin that individual retailers are unable to grow and increase their profit margins so larger, vertically integrated companies are able to dominate and ultimately buy out the competition. 

It‚Äôs really a policy decision: is it better to share the wealth between, say, 100 retailers who all make good money or between 5 major retailers who make a ton of money. Sharing between 5 large retailers would likely bring the cost down for the consumer ultimately but presents less opportunity for wealth generation, particularly in communities where prohibition was most heavily enforced.",t2_10sovk,HotSauceCommitteeMem,0,1648995921.0,0,t1_i385l2p,i385l2p,False,Maxcactus,t3_tug71i,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/tug71i/maryland_general_assembly_passes_bill_setting/,Maryland General Assembly Passes Bill Setting November Referendum On Legalizing Marijuana,/r/maryland/comments/tug71i/maryland_general_assembly_passes_bill_setting/i385l2p/,1,r/maryland,0,1

"Own a shop, we don't do inspections anymore.

 Generally, if they have mechanics there, do the work there. Why because they sign-off on it when the repair is done, and they will do it right and to the inspectors liking. You aren't going to save more then 10% first, second they will do repairs, I will not.

Lastly, you avoid the shop bounce. Where they don't like the work and make you back to the original shop. Even if it is no more then a 1/4 wrench turn.

One piece of advice. Set up an appointment. Most of the shops I called for my truck a couple months ago wanted the truck at 8:00 a.m. and to be left al day.

It is a one time deal in Md, so they are pretty thorough. Why do we not do it anymore. The new state trooper who took over our inspection (yes, we get audited by the state and it was is a trooper) was being a jerk. He wanted  us to repaint our building.

"when i went online to register my car (moving from Cal to MD), the approximate calculator said i was gonna have to pay $2100.  I then delayed my registration for another year, and opted instead to have my tags be mailed by to me by my family. Insurance was also from cali. Good thing is that they dont check how long you've been having your car unless you create a record like getting a ticket or not paying your local mechanic for the car inspection. (Speed cam tickets dont count)
  
Anyways, when i went to the actual building, i first got my MD license followed by the car registration. At the counter i only had to pay $200 (actually $220 for the orange lic plate).

"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever say something like that because it‚Äôs objectively untrue, what is true is that there has been a pretty large schism among republicans over Trump and the Jan 6 bullshit, to the point where Trumpers have attacked non-Trump supporter republicans for being traitors or ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù 

Cawthorn is an example of the Republicans that have gone completely off the rails

A lot of republicans though aren‚Äôt happy with that and don‚Äôt support shit like Q or Trump, even during Trump‚Äôs term some republicans actively disliked his decisions (shit both Romney and McCain who were both Rep presidential pics didn‚Äôt support Trump)

Shit some people who initially supported trump, even his own Vice President, didn‚Äôt endorse the kind of shit that went down on Jan 6

"I want to move to Sweden.

There's a nicety here, but it seems to be from the wrong places. It seems like people are nice because they should be, and not because they have any compassion towards each other.

Property values are high at the moment, and taxes are high as well. Theres also a mass exodus of retirees due to a lack of state programs. There's very much money to be made here, but everyone knows that, so everyone wants a cut. However it is causing the population  to be much more youthful. I see a promising future in the educated wealthy youth, but more and more people are being pushed out of cities due to pricing.

"I'm hating on a group that keeps insisting on perpetuating the problems they created for younger generations to try their best to fix before they end humanity.

They had a chance to fix global warming - they're blowing right past the point-of-no-return.

They had a chance to fix the justice system - they criminalized overworked people who self-medicated with drugs they put into their neighborhoods while in poverty, and then profited off of their incarceration.

They had a chance to teach love and compassion for each other, but they created (and still create) anti-civil rights laws.

They had a chance to fix healthcare in this country MULTIPLE times, and instead insist on making it worse for managed health corporations to control how doctors treat patients for their own benefit, not the patients, and not the doctors.

They had multiple opportunities to fix the education system so kids don't slip through the cracks and join the military that's never gone a decade without being involved in some major war, yet the majority of our tax dollars go towards the military instead of education.

They had multiple times to restore the tax codes that have kept us a prosperous, happy, and healthy country. Yet, the wealthiest people in our country pay a marginal tax rate of less than 40% for the enormous wealth this nation's citizens, roads, laws, first responders, economy, etc. has afforded them to create, unlike the 90% it used to be.

Don't give me laughable silliness on ""you'll learn that hating on groups is wrong"" crap because of whatever culpability you might feel. Boomers are creating wealth on the destruction of the future, and passing the buck for younger generations to try their best to clean up over decades.

"Since people in communities of color were prosecuted significantly more than white communities despite roughly equal usage rates - and a large reason for cannabis prohibition in the first place to be to incarcerate minorities - members of the legislature feel that licenses should be set aside for minority-owned businesses to sell cannabis. This is especially the case since when medical cannabis first became legal not a single minority-owned business was awarded a license to sell. 

However, per state law, the General Assembly can‚Äôt create laws to set aside things like licenses for classes like race without completing what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúdisparity study‚Äù. This approach gives time for the study to be commissioned and completed while moving the ball forward on legalization.

"Basically, that's why the quality of marijuana took a few years to get good in MD dispensaries. The laws stated the growers had to start from seed to sale, only through the eventual cloning process can you churn out consistent, high quality bud. As far as buying farmland to start your own legal, commercial grow- Good luck, especially with the cost and demand for land in MD. That's kind of the point a lot of people here are making, the laws were structured for multimillionaires to come in, buy up farmland and start growing. The laws weren't written for commoners to be a part of the legalized distribution process. The nonrefundable application fee to even be considered to grow in MD was thousands of dollars, along with an unnecessary amount of acreage, something like an annual $125000 licensing fee and around $500000 in the bank. Also remember it's a cash only business. I'm pretty sure the initial application process was a scam/cash grab, most likely the growers were already decided upon with a backdoor handshake and the rest of the applicants gave the state of MD a bunch of free $$$.",t2_3oju0u1x,SchmohawkWokeSquawk,0,1648921814.0,0,t1_i34rq2q,i34rq2q,False,Maxcactus,t3_tug71i,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/tug71i/maryland_general_assembly_passes_bill_setting/,Maryland General Assembly Passes Bill Setting November Referendum On Legalizing Marijuana,/r/maryland/comments/tug71i/maryland_general_assembly_passes_bill_setting/i34rq2q/,2,r/maryland,0,2

"If the very exercise of legalization exposes you to a fine, up to a misdemeanor, at any LEO's discretion? It's just begging to be abused. It's another free charge that a cop or prosecutor could throw at you if they want to squeeze a plea deal for some unrelated matter. Beyond that, the argument of 'intent to distribute' doesn't make any sense considering I certainly intend to distribute if I buy a handle of vodka, for example. If anyone (over the age of 21) is allowed to have weed in the state of Maryland, why write a provision against possessing that legal thing?

"LMAO why is everything so creepy to this dude? They broke into someone's house - that's not even close to being a mansion - and they're rummaging around like a couple of 12 year olds in a haunted house. That house is clearly not abandoned. Two things must occur for property to be abandoned: (1) an act by the owner that clearly shows that he or she has given up rights to the property; and (2) an intention that demonstrates that the owner has knowingly relinquished control over it. The passage of time, although not an element of abandonment, may illustrate a person's intention to abandon his or her property.  
New and old items, food items, dishes, and miscellaneous things everywhere doesn't mean the house is abandoned. Nobody living in the house doesn't mean it's abandoned. An overgrown backyard and a car graveyard doesn't mean the house is abandoned. And finally, personalized SLY license plates don't indicate that Sylvester Stallone owns/owned the vehicles. 

If it's abandoned, why didn't those idiots take that ""radio or whatever it is""? He figures it's gotta be worth something since it's so old... and it's abandoned right? So why didn't they take anything with them? It was all too creepy I guess. 

If it's stealing, that means the property is not abandoned. So taking anything, including any of the cars or that old antique valuable looking radio thing, or some clothes... or that leather furniture - that wouldn't be stealing if it's abandoned. It's literally up for grabs. They didn't take anything because they knew it would be stealing which means the property can't be abandoned. Someone has a claim on it.

Some clear action must be taken to indicate that the owner no longer wants his or her property. Any act is sufficient as long as the property is left free and open to anyone who comes along to claim it. Inaction‚Äîthat is, failure to do something with the property or nonuse of it‚Äîis not enough to demonstrate that the owner has relinquished rights to the property, even if such nonuse has gone on for a number of years. 

Given there are very old items in the house with newer items, it's obvious someone lived there for many years. The overgrown yard and non-maintained collection of cars indicates the person stopped maintaining the property but I don't see how that implies it's abandoned. Whoever the person was, it wasn't Stallone or his family, because if that were his family's home, they moved away when he was a child and they definitely couldn't afford a car collection. So this is nothing more than a couple of morons sneaking around some poor old dead person's house, amazed that ""there are clothes still there.""

"Hi!  I've spend lots of time in Sweden (mostly the Stockholm area) and loved it there.  What a beautiful country!  The rural areas there are just amazing, and there seemed to be a lot of outdoor things to do.  The public transportation system is fantastic and safe, never needed a car when I was there.  Mobile phone service was very inexpensive relative to here in Maryland.  However, the cost of groceries and rent (and of course, alcohol) was quite high, which makes the overall cost of living higher there than here I think.  People were very nice, and since nearly everyone there speaks English I never had problems communicating with others.

"It‚Äôs meant to keep people on the teet of corporate weed, which is NOT the point for me. Plants do not magically produce each day so people need the ability to harvest when plants produce and keep until they produce again. Legalization is when people can grow and keep harvest. I understand the ‚Äòworst case‚Äô scenario of some nutter growing 8000 plants in a neighborhood but historically the greater worst case is cops targeting minorities for growing 5 plants or holding 5 oz because they were good at growing two plants. 

The point of the law for me, as I need to clarify, is legalization to stop the unfair treatment of vulnerable humans by police.
