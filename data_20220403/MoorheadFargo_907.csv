"I'd echo many of these recommendations, especially if you're near downtown. Are you renting a car? Uber/Lift? Do you know where you're staying in town. There is likely some decent restaurants/bars near you as well. Also if you're coming to town soon, the fall colors are at their peak right now and a short drive into MN is enjoyable if you'd like.

Regardless, I love Fargo and thinks it has a lot to offer. Ignore the trolls that have answered already. Downtown is safe, but just has a homeless population like any other city.

"There is such a large variety in local restaurants. Some of my favorites are Vinyl Taco, Blackbird Woodfire Pizza, Doolittle's Woodfire Grill, Izumis, and Indian Palace (which is currently carry out or reservation only). There are also a couple decent coffee shops, such as Red Raven Espresso Parlor, Babb's, Nichole's Fine Pastry & Cafe, and Beans. If you like Chai, from 7a-10a there is an EXCELLENT Chai Tea truck called Namaste Chai that parks in the South University Hornbacher's (our local grocer) parking lot. I would definitely check them out. 

I would avoid The Empire and Rick's. But Dempsey's is fun, especially for trivia or bingo nights. I think this Wednesday you get a free hotdog with a drink purchase, and they have some pretty decent hot dogs for being a bar. Side Street is another fun one! 

Otherwise, there are tons of boutiques (not sure if you're into that) and live music events at various places.

"Well, for starters, it isn't cold the entire year, mostly just really really cold in the winter. Today was right around 100‚Å∞F.

I actually work as a security guard at Minnesota State University Moorhead and we are almost always hiring. I'm sure Concordia College is similar.

They reduced tuition to 27k this past year and you still get scholarships. No it‚Äôs not for everyone. There is no point in arguing with you. You had a bad experience at literally one of the most expensive private liberal arts colleges in the state if not the country and now Concordia sucks because of it basically. You also definitely do not get federal aid in your fifth year. If you actually got federal aid you would know that.,t2_3jwtlws5,LucyBallistic,0,1619923218.0,0,t1_gwm7gqz,gwm7gqz,False,[deleted],t3_n2krrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FargoMoorhead/comments/n2krrp/im_interested_in_attending_msum_and_was_wondering/,"I‚Äôm interested in attending MSUM and was wondering if someone could show me the inside of the building (Cafeteria, Dorms, typical lecture hall etc..)",/r/FargoMoorhead/comments/n2krrp/im_interested_in_attending_msum_and_was_wondering/gwm7gqz/,0,r/FargoMoorhead,0,0
9k tuition/year vs 43k. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you paid a year out of pocket. My spouse and I both took more than 4 years to graduate. Our aid continued on unaffected. I actually started at Macalester (similar to Concordia in St. Paul) and figured my parents were broke enough to get tons of grants. I was wrong. Shit tons of loans for one semester. Including shitty private loans!

Ya I‚Äôll get right on that. Bottom line is this: Look up 4 year graduation rates of MSUM. You‚Äôre talking 21 percent for 4 years which means you‚Äôre absolutely going for 5 at minimum. NDSU is similar. How much aid do you get in your fifth year? None. However you‚Äôll graduate in four years from a Concordia. They even have a four year guarantee that if you don‚Äôt they will cover your fifth year.

A lot of the professors are really good, I've yet to have a really dramatically bad one, only one was below average. The campus can be kinda quiet, this isn't a party school by any means, but  it's fun anyway. Lots of really cool people. Kise food is either a 1 or a 10, no in between. Ask about the mouse incident.

"Music Education student here. 

It's a really good small campus and it's easy to make friends. COVID levels are pretty good at the moment and we feel very safe. Unfortunately, there's not as much going on right now for entertainment but I hope things get better once things get back to normal. Lots of cool local music venues. 

The campus as a whole is pretty, but some of the facilities could use an update, but of course there's no money for that. I really like how cheap the cost is and the community that is there.

"I just moved back to Fargo/Moorhead from Shakopee MN (Moorhead class of '85).  I was in the cities for about 25 years and Shakopee has a large Amazon Distribution center there that was built about 5 years ago and here's what I've noticed:

Forget any Tax benefit.  Amazon is brutal in their negotiations.  Cities think they're going to get this huge tax windfall and tons of new jobs but in the end, the city always comes up the loser.  They use their size to bully cities to give them tax credits and if they don't get what they want, they go somewhere else - offering jobs to the next victim.  It's not unusual to see them not pay any taxes for the length of their stay.  It's cheaper for them to back out of a contract after 10 years than to pay taxes.

All the jobs are minimum wage jobs for people to box items.  The warehouses are highly automated so there's very few people who make more than the minimum.  This doesn't mean anything but yes, the large majority of people working at the Shakopee Distribution center are Somali.  Every few months, they walk out because Amazon doesn't give them enough time to pray 5 times a day.  Hey, if that's what they want to do, fine, as long as it doesn't add work to others.

My daughter worked there for a short time.  Usually 4 x 10 hour days but burnout is high.  Same gig day after day.  You never leave your post - they have ""runners"" to get you things:  They run from station to station all day filling your cardboard, labels, etc.  Run out of tape? You hit a button that turns on a light and the runner comes a running to give you more.   You are judged by the number of boxes you fill based on the size.  Large boxes = 'x' amount of time, book boxes you have to do more.  It is a fire-able offense to not make your numbers.

It's good for the consumer as you can get same day delivery - works great for groceries but don't expect your property taxes to drop or a bunch of high paying jobs to open up.  It's not going to happen.",t2_jnu691g,JohnnyByte64,0,1609883299.0,0,t1_gi88zg2,gi88zg2,True,ShellyMarcone,t3_k6wmgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FargoMoorhead/comments/k6wmgs/is_fargo_ready_for_amazon_to_come_to_town/,Is Fargo ready for Amazon to come to town?,/r/FargoMoorhead/comments/k6wmgs/is_fargo_ready_for_amazon_to_come_to_town/gi88zg2/,1,r/FargoMoorhead,0,1

Some of my faves: Buffalo River State Park (within 30min or so of Fargo), Maplewood (a little over an hour), and Itasca (about 2.5 hours, and that one especially is absolutely stunning in the fall).

"Vegetarian restaurants is one I kinda know!

Every Indian/Nepali restaurant in F/M will have pretty good vegetarian food. India Palace, Passage to India, Himalayan Yak, and Everest Tikka House are the main ones, if not all of em. They're all doing take-out/delivery atm, but a few do lunch buffets when the world isn't falling apart.

The two Thai restaurants I can think of, Leela Thai and Thai Orchid, both should have good selections of vegetarian food.

There's also a couple Mediterranean restaurants, Ishtar and Cafe Aladdin. Ishtar is pretty decent. Cafe Aladdin is imo not very good, but it's there.

One more *exceptionally good* place to try is Bernbaum's. It's a Scandinavian/Jewish restaurant (i think). Regular fare is bagels, egg bakes, and salmon lox. It can be hard to explain and a hard sell, but it's really fantastic imo. I went there daily for a full week after first discovering it. They have some vegan/vegetarian options. If you eat egg, the ""Daily Egg"" is usually stellar.

There used to be a vegan restaurant downtown called Green House Cafe, but that's been closed for a few years. Since then, I don't think there's been a restaurant that only serves vegan/vegetarian food.

I took all that all differently. They used his unrelated past crimes to make that determination.

"A warning if you're going to play at a game store vs. having a home game. 

Sessions held at game stores can be great to meet new people that play. They can be great to teach you the mechanics of the game and how sessions can be run on the technical side. They're also full of laughter (barring the occasional d-bag) and are great fun!

However, they tend to lack in RP or heavy story-telling moments. That's not to say they don't happen but it's rare when playing in Adventure League as DM's are mostly worried about getting the players through the session in a timely manner.

"*Some have complained the process to put legislation in place to accommodate the sale, possession and use of medical marijuana has taken too long, but the industry is relatively new across the country, and states need to take their time to put regulations in place that will make access to the drug safe for patients, said Ben Kimbro, director of business strategy for Harvest Health and Recreation, which will open dispensaries in Williston and Bismarck.*

*‚ÄúI would commend North Dakota on the way they have handled implementing the process,‚Äù Kimbro said.*  


Ahahahaha fucking **morons**.  It'd be real great if they would take a look at **any other state** that has implemented it, and then compare how much longer the 'great state of North Dakota' has taken to handle such a process, when we've got about .05% of the potential trouble to deal with here, thanks to our population density.

The simple truth about this shit is that the legislators have drug their feet as far as handling the will of the people, which is the complete extent of their job, badly enough that they should all be kicked the fuck out of office, and banned from any positions in public service, or any others in private service where they're in charge of any other people or resources.

"NDSU as an FCS school can‚Äôt pay as much as an FBS school, especially a team from a ‚Äúpower 5‚Äù conference. Those schools have the larger fan bases, lucrative TV contracts, wealthier alumni networks.

Unless NDSU is in the highest division of college football, a successful coach will never be a lifer with the Bison. There‚Äôs no road for the Bison to get to that upper-tier for the foreseeable future because adding NDSU to one of these conferences would not create a net financial gain. Even if NDSU was a successful football program in one of these conferences (Big Ten or Big 12 are the only geographical matches) they won‚Äôt get an invite because North Dakota isn‚Äôt a sought after TV market.

TV money is the driving factor in expanding a conference footprint. Even if you considered ND and SD together (blasphemy, I know), the Big 12, most likely conference in my opinion, would have bigger markets, that still make geographical sense, in Nevada and Montana.

The picture was taken from the catwalk outside the old Fargo Armory which was torn down 10 years later.",t2_14m3z5,DJSonicTremor,0,1539356887.0,0,t1_e7n13rn,e7n13rn,False,DJSonicTremor,t3_9nbo4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/FargoMoorhead/comments/9nbo4b/red_river_flood_fargo_north_dakota_1952_red_owl/,"Red River Flood, Fargo, North Dakota, 1952.
