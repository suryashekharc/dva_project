Then the word BASED is so huge and in my face. Is this a book we should all know? Because I don’t know it it, so it doesn’t help me to understand if I want to see this film, but that message stays on screen for a LONG time. A lot of the text lingers on the screen too long. What is MESN? A person? Is this about getting pussy and drinking beer? Is this an ad for a music festival in Denver? Does this take place in airports? Are these shots from the movie? They kind of look like stock footage. That can be a good thing, because they’re high quality… but the visuals also don’t really tell me anything about the film.

"Oh no worries at all, trust me I understand where you are coming from 100%. I can imagine that is the case lots of time, but yes just being honest just simply did not think to include it right away. But like I said I am very upfront and honest that the pay is just minimum wage so understandable if that discourages people. However, like I said it is a decent amount of hours each day and one is able to work more then the required 3-4 days per week if one likes. So this job definitely will still give you an opportunity to save up some money this Summer. It also has the benefit of being in a state park, which obviously I am biased because RST is my major, but I feel like lots of people would agree with me that it is pretty cool. But yes if anyone has any more questions or wondering more about each position, do not hesitate to ask.",t2_ff1nxyk9,Willyt2_2_3,0,1644443170.0,0,t1_hwa5mvi,hwa5mvi,False,Willyt2_2_3,t3_so2jxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralillinois/comments/so2jxo/kickapoo_state_park_job_opportunity/,Kickapoo State Park Job opportunity,/r/centralillinois/comments/so2jxo/kickapoo_state_park_job_opportunity/hwa5mvi/,1,r/centralillinois,0,1
"One last thing, there is openings as I said for the customer service position. But we are also looking for drivers. As a driver it would be the same pay, hours, and amount of days expected to work a week. However, instead of jut normally working at the store, you will be in charge of driving a bus and meeting people at the store who have either made a reservation for tubing or kayaking. Once at the store you will be in charge of helping load up the kayaks or tubes and then take out the people to the starting point on the River for their trip. The kayaks and tubes are pretty heavy so we recommend for this position people who are confident in lifting heavy objects throughout the day.

"I mean I can ensure you that it is not a passion exploitation job. Look I'll be honest I am just a Senior at UIUC right now and really new at this. So me not including the salary and more information was honestly just because I did not think to include it. But look, I will be upfront about it, it is not the best pay, however it is easy to gain lots of hours and still make a lot of money this summer. This job is just meant to be part time and for people just trying to have a fun work experience while making some extra cash. I will be the manger during the season and right now am in charge of recruitment and marketing so just going through lots of different medians to try and get the word out. Furthermore, I will be honest I never worked there during the actual season, like I said I just started right now as this semester started 4 weeks ago. However, I have been out to the park and the store and I can ensure you it is very beautiful. I also have reached out to the last two managers during the last 2 seasons and they each told me that people in these part time positions we are offering truly do enjoy it. I have heard from them it is a very laid back work environment. The uniform will just be a shirt you are given with the logo or you can even wear a tank top version of it when it gets really hot out. The managers also told me it normally slows down around 2-3, so the last few hours are even more laid back and they told me lots of times they would all just jump in the Lake that is right near the store and swim around in it for a bit when there is down time. Normally the positions are filled by people in High School or early in College that live in the area and just trying to find a Summer job. So if that is you or someone you know, you should definitley consider working here as you will not have to work 5+ days a week as some other part time jobs will require and truly will be a fun work environment as manager I will obviously make it so that work comes first but will still be laid back enough so people can truly enjoy the time here. That is a lot I know but I hope that answers some of your concerns and questions.

Flash forward to today.. almost exactly a year after the last experience.. it’s 2:30AM. Normal bedtime routine. I hear a little girl crying. It sounded like my daughter. I opened the baby camera that picks up all noise from the upstairs. Silent. No noise. The crying stopped instantly. I ran upstairs and all the kids are passed out. My husband is confused as can be.

"Well, for one thing, it wasn't 1,700 mph. It was 1,100 mph.

"It was an encounter along Illinois Route 78 near Chandlerville that lasted just seconds.But it left a lasting impression on a driver going from Cass County to Tazewell County that night.""When it hit the shoulder, it looked back at me,"" he said. ""I said to myself out loud, '(expletive)ing Bigfoot!'.""Even those who consider the idea of some super-sized primate wandering through the woods to be hokum are finding their interest piqued. Witness Patrick Garver's report has drawn the attention of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization and has been making the rounds on various social media sites, both pro- and con-Bigfoot existence.The legend of a huge creature lumbering through isolated, wooded areas dates at least as far back as the Salish Indians. They told stories about encounters in the Pacific Northwest with ""se'sxac""  — an ape-like man from 6 to 15 feet tall who walked upright, occasionally emitting a high-pitched noise. By the 1950s, the nickname ""Bigfoot"" was born as more sightings were reported and hunters ran across massive footprints that couldn't be explained.But let's get back to Cass County.Garver was driving the stretch of road about 10:30 p.m. Nov. 29, heading north.""I saw a large animal jump into the road about 40 yards ahead. When it hit the road, I could see very large legs spread wide in a dead run with large, swinging, hairy arms. The arms switched back and forth close to the ground as its body was leaning forward. It leaped across the road in two jumps,"" he told investigators for the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, a scientific research group founded in 1995.Garver said it was about two seconds before the creature vanished into the darkness.""I could see it clearly,"" he said. ""It was very large and, even though it was hunched over nearly horizontal, it still was close to being wider than my car and nearly to the top of my windshield. It blocked out the lights of (a) car ahead.""He recalled it having shiny black hair and a huge stride.""It was running and leaping very fast,"" he said. ""Nearly as fast as a white-tail deer.""He continued driving until he reached Havana, where he stopped to send a text his wife and children about what he experienced.Garver also shared the story of the encounter with a co-worker. Instead of being incredulous, the co-worker told of local tales of a clan of Bigfoot living in the area and said there have been multiple sightings by hunters, fishermen and barge operators.It was the first sighting report Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization investigator Matthew Moneymaker recalled from Cass County — although unexplained tracks were found in a creek bed near Chandlerville in 1991. Neighboring Sangamon County has generated 13 reported sightings since 1976, the most recent in September 2017 near Rochester.Moneymaker is founding director of the organization and has been involved with a number of documentaries about Sasquatch, as well as co-host of the program ""Finding Bigfoot"" that appeared on Animal Planet Channel for seven years.""This is a very reliable sighting,"" he said. ""I spoke extensively with the witness by phone. He was not particularly interested in the Bigfoot subject, but he recognized what he was seeing.""There have been four encounters noted in Morgan County: A runner reported a sighting south of Jacksonville in August 2006; sounds and a sighting were reported near Murrayville in July 2006; a motorist said he saw a Bigfoot near Lake Jacksonville in November 2005; and a resident in January 1986 recalled a previous possible sighting in a pasture east of Jacksonville.Of the 301 reports of sightings or Bigfoot-related phenomenon in Illinois, Madison County leads the way with 24. The latest was in August 2017, when a motorist reported seeing a creature crossing the road near Troy. Additional reports since 1972 have come from near Godfrey, outside Hamel, near Edwardsville, near Alton, west of St. Jacob, and near Granite City.Other reports from west-central Illinois counties, according to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization's database:    Calhoun County: 2, the most recent in May 1998.    Jersey County: 2, the most recent in May 2008 near Otterville.    Macoupin County: 13, the most recent in November 2016 near Sunset Lake west of Girard.    Pike County: 1, in November 2007 near Detroit.

"Just gave away all three gaming consoles. Check out the YouTube for the lives and the socials for the posts. All three winners have spoken out and claimed them. All reasonably local and two will be picked up tonight! Awesome!   
I took a bit of a loss on these three but wanted them closed by the holidays and for that damned website feature. Hopefully the new items and said feature help us gain some traction.   
The concept isn't new. People are doing it everyday on 'other' social sites. Waffles, Razz's etc. Those are illegal for a few reasons though. I know the webinar portion can be confusing but it's a necessity here in IL.  We are a fully registered LLC. You can look us up on the IL Sec of State website. (https://apps.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/) tick LLC and enter our name ""Sold Out Webinars"" . We pay 100% of our taxes. The payments are secured and processed via Shopify's provider Stripe. We don't have any access to that data.   
We will not rig a drawing so don't ask. IDK how many times I get that question... Perhaps people are just testing the waters IDK. The live is used to prevent any accusations of cheating.  We use ranom.org to pick the winners. The time, date, etc is all there on the stream to see. We refresh a few times to clear all the data. The way it is all setup we secure our costs and profits before it is ever given away. By the time we give it away we've already made our portion. It would not behoove us in anyway to not give away a prize or alter the drawing results. We have had free promotions go unclaimed and in that case we waited the preset claiming period, listed in the rules (We actually shortened it because of that one) and did a re-draw. The second winner claimed his prize.   
I've been working on getting the winners to post their winnings but it appears some gamblers do not like letting others know.  That might be a tough hurdle to clear but we've had some mixed results...  
Any other questions? I'd love to answer them.

"i hate the fact they are so highly visible; one reason is  because of pollution of the gorgeous starry night sky. Not looking forward to the final aesthetic change once its complete. 

But the bigger issue is there are still tribes that have no idea of this technology in remote parts of the world; and there are laws in place to prevent us interacting with them and forcefully changing the course of their culture. its basically like a Prime Directive light version from Star Trek. 

odds are high it will alter their culture at least from a religious aspect as has been seen with big changes in asterial bodies in past civilizations.

"I am closing the PS5, Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch bundle webinars on 12/4 if they are full or not. I've got a new website feature that will allow users to pick their ""seat"" as well as buy multiple seats for a single webinar under a single transaction.  I am going to clean house to make that transition easier and to guarantee these are given away before the holiday.    


If you're not already familiar with what we do here is a quick walk-through.   


We can’t legally run a raffle, but we can sell seats to a webinar and have a GIVEAWAY attached to it. 😉 😉  


Each item page lists the webinar cost and seat limit for that particular item (for odds) as well as remaining seats before we go live.  


Once all the seats have sold the webinar will go live on YouTube. At the conclusion of the webinar a random winner is picked using random.org. That winner will take the item being reviewed home for the cost of entry.  
  
No need to watch to win. The winner will be contacted immediately following the drawing using the details provided at purchase.  


Local pick up/drop off is available (Morton) or we can ship for free. 

See SoldOutWebinars.net for the official sweepstakes rules, terms and conditions, FAQ’s and an example of one of our webinars.  


Unlike the razz, waffle, etc. pages on other social media sites We are a fully registered and tax paying business. We are biased in Morton IL. All credit card payments are secured and processed by Stripe the official Shopify provider.   


You can always DM, email (Admin@SoldOutWebinars.net) or text/call 1-309-273-1185 with any questions.

"I  lived in the Peoria area for a number of years (don't currently live there).  As far as Peoria is Concerned there is a lot of good eating.  Some restraunts I suggest are Thyme (high end bar food), Sugar (wood fired pizza), Ardor (amazing bakery) and in Peoria Heights the main drag and many higher end places with amazing food.  As far as ethnic and Vegan, I know One World Cafe by the university is very good and well priced.  there are a few Indian and other places around there as well (probably changed since I was there).

In addition to all of this, they have a number of breweries (I suggest Rhodell's), Black Band Distillery, and if you go north slightly there is a Winery in Edwards (easy travel distance) also, I believe there are a few breweries in the surrounding towns (not 100% sure).  As a side note I suggest Pour Bros. bar in Peoria Heights.  The specialize in craft brews and always have a good selection.

Unfortunately I am a terrible source for outdoors stuff as that's not my thing.  After saying all of this I do recommend Champaign as well.  The university is much larger and there will be a larger international community.

Lol yeah ok. All I said is everyone has the right to defend themselves. All the other guys at those car lots had guns. And some of the protestors aka Gage had a gun. And I do wish the cops would have stood up and took care of the situation. Just like I wish that the citizens of Chicago should stand up against gang bangers shooting babies in strollers. Yes that does happen in Chicago. They will shoot a rival gang members baby momma or children for what?? Clout? They really need to start there own neighborhood watch group to protect there families. Atleast then the people in the communities could clean up the violence if the police won't.

"Listen, it seems you’re really trying to defend Rittenhouse here. There’s a lot of emotion in your message and it seems you feel personally attacked by someone doubting that Rittenhouse was nothing but a hero and behaved honestly. 

I’m not sure if that makes you naive, manipulated, or just misguided. In any case, if you think Kyle went there just trying to be voice his constitutional opinion and you don’t think he was escalating the situation by bringing an AR-15 with him, I think you’re just wrong in your opinion and we can just agree to disagree. He weaponized stand your ground laws by putting himself in a position where he caused someone to antagonize him, so he could have the reasonable “fear for his life” that allowed him to legally discharge his weapon on people with whom he disagreed. I never brought up defunding the police, you did. Lastly, when you start talking about groups of people as “them”, you’re displaying a segregational view of the world. I hope you sincerely can understand that people are just people, there are good and bad people in every one regardless of color. All communities are ultimately part of one society and every gun crime needs to be understood in the context in which it exists. Poor people shoot each other all over the world. There happens to be more black people in the poorer areas of Chicago and so that’s classified as “black on black” crime by people who want to create segregation.

"My point is that Kyle weaponized stand-your-ground laws. What he did was not illegal, he’s certainly not guilty and the trial confirmed that. However, he was not innocent in any sense of the word. He went to protest with a loaded gun and discharged it when he felt he would be justified to do so. Then, after already having shot someone who died, he did not choose to leave. He chose to stick around until he was justified to do it again. All within the law, sure, but it wasn’t innocent and it sure was all kinds of messed up. 

What you said last is most disheartening. What you are saying is vigilantism is ok. Let’s just go back to the old west and shoot whenever we feel threatened, that’s fine. Except it’s not, and it only ended this way due to Kyle’s skin color and we both know that.

"Some helpful info missing - power, gas, good or poor insulation.

\-you can always slap in a wood burner and vent pipe and burn whatever wood scraps or firewood you like. No power needed. Can be stoked to roast U out of there if you like it extra warm.

\- Does the detached garage have power (guessing yes, at least a 115v circuit or two; we like our electric door openers, lights, and a couple outlets for a tools, chargers, a radio around here...) then the fastest, easiest, cheapest heat is a kerosene or propane ""salamander"" heater. They work very nicely. They plug into an extension cord and put out lots of heat. Contractors use them on jobsites all the time.

* You can always pick up a plug in carbon monoxide detector if using either type of heater makes you nervous. They are stupid cheap these days.

\-there are some propane radiant heaters that pretty much screw onto the same type of propane tank that are used on bbq grilles. Much better than nothing. Expensive way to buy propane fuel, but cheaper than electricity.

\-don't bother with 115v space heaters, won't have a chance of keeping up and take forever to make even a little difference.

\-If you have 220v power to the garage, then a more powerful electric heater can make a big difference, including a hanging type unit. But it'll put a heck of a thumping on your wallet. No risk of fumes.

&#x200B;

\-If you have natural gas (preferred) or propane (if you are rural) piped to the garage, a hanging heater is the preferred choice for economical and effective heat. It'll cost you a couple-few thousand to obtain one and have it installed with vent. Add another couple few stacks of $$ to the cost to bury gaseous fuel piping to the garage.

"Don't forget about summer, heat and humidity can make it just as miserable working in the garage as when it's too cold in the winter, and some years that can last from late May to September.  A great option in a mini split, the Mr. Cool (sold at a pretty good price at Sam's, but there are countless others, some less expensive and some even better but not DIY friendly).  The biggest downside is that it can't heat below 5 degrees, and close to that temperature (just above 5 degrees) the BTU output drops off.  Central Illinois gets plenty of cold damp weather, but it isn't below 5 degrees very long most years, and I just can't remember a time when it persisted for longer than a week, so for occasional garage usage, for most people I think that would be fine.  The upside is that cost of heating is very good, a little worse than natural gas, but a lot better than propane, and no fumes, and of course it also provides cooling.  Also, that isn't the only mini split, so if heating during unusual cold weather is an issue, some of the others can heat at a much, much lower temperature, just at a higher cost and requiring a professional installation.  Also, don't forget about insulation, improving that can reduce your heating/cooling requirements considerably.",t2_9rs7o13m,Careless-Light6856,0,1635443646.0,0,t1_hieq0xj,hieq0xj,True,[deleted],t3_qhre9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralillinois/comments/qhre9l/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/centralillinois/comments/qhre9l/deleted_by_user/hieq0xj/,14,r/centralillinois,0,14

"\-Catalpa. You are correct. Sorry, we spent a number of years in the South and that's how the folks down there pronounce and spell it. They prize ""Catawba's"" for the ""worms"" attracted to them (Sphinx Caterpillars), used for fishing....

\-Kentucky Chestnut; am as positive as a rookie can be that it's an American Chestnut, either of a variety or particular size that was common in the Eastern KY area his family came from. Hills and Hollers...The friend who's Dad planted the tree built the house when Eddie was a gradeschool student in the 40s. During one of their trips back to KY to  visit, the Dad decided he wanted a Chestnut in his back yard, brought back some saplings from what Eddie described. One of them survived.

Fast forward to 2004, when Eddie's mother passed away at the same home, he asked me to buy the house from the estate so that he would be comfortable with it being kept after (his family actually built it themselves, masonry and all), and he was especially worried about the tree being removed out of ignorance by future homeowners. Well, my wife didn't want that house...she wanted small town life for the children (now grown).

I visit the tree annually about this time of year to see if it's fruiting, and most every year it is. Same for this year, checked on it last week. Mostly I keep wanting to catch the homeowner outside to make sure the owners haven't changed without knowing the trees story and it's importance (i.e. near extinction) so that it's not cut down as a nuisance by an uninformed person. Telling you, those spiky Chestnut husks are hazardous to bare hands, feet, mower tires, etc. Oddly, the squirrels have no problem managing the nuts out of the husks lightning fast - - but of course they leave the spiky husks right where they fell...",t2_6yu4ehou,MostlyUnimpressed,0,1632856750.0,0,t1_hemqv17,hemqv17,False,sylvics_trees,t3_pxbvmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralillinois/comments/pxbvmx/i_am_reforesting_peoria_illinois_usa_ama/,"I Am Reforesting Peoria, Illinois, USA (AMA)",/r/centralillinois/comments/pxbvmx/i_am_reforesting_peoria_illinois_usa_ama/hemqv17/,3,r/centralillinois,0,3

"Hats off to you, Sylvics ! Nut trees are a tad messy but great shade when its needed, and critters really thrive on them. Having them on a property is worth the extra maintenance on the lawn mower blades....

Pardon the babble if you're already working with these, but a couple of species come to mind that are quite striking and do well in Illinois -  Lindens and Catawba trees. Both long lived bloomers that smell wonderful when on display. Have been wanting to add a couple of each on our property in the right placements, but haven't for lack of knowing how to nurse them up. 

\-I do know of a legitimate, genetically pure Kentucky Chestnut in Bloomington IL. It was brought to that town by a native Kentuckian in the 1940s by the father of a deceased friend of ours. It reminded him of home. Stunning trees, but their spiky chestnuts are actually dangerous when they are fruiting. Talking leather gloves to handle them is a must. So they aren't popular in yards or inhabited areas where people or vehicles with tires pass by. Its a shame, due their near extinct status and being a superfood for wildlife. Very careful planning and placement are critical, one would suppose.

Wish I were versed enough to talk intelligently to you about trees, but much appreciation and admiration for what you are doing.

"1. The vaccine is fully approved now - it's no longer experimental. It's also one of the most closely-studied rollouts of all time: they're catching side effects with close to one in a million chances. Also, why didn't you take it months ago when it was approved for teens, before it was mandated?

2. The government already requires you to get a number of vaccines in order to attend public school. This seems like a clear parallel. 

3. The vaccine clearly protects you from getting hospitalized, but it does help your chances of getting infected in the first place too. And it helps reduce your likelihood of spreading the disease to someone else who might be more vulnerable.

"My apologies for being sloppy with language.

We've beaten similarly virulent viruses with vaccination campaigns before.

COVID is more like measles, mumps, and rubella than the flu.  Those technically aren't extinct, but they a non-issue for those of us outside of the anti-vaxxer community.

While those diseases technically haven't died out, we have definitely beaten them through vaccination as far as making them a non-issue.  The only places we see those diseases is through self-inflicted outbreaks in anti-vaxxer communities. The rest of us make a poor habitat for that shit.

If those who say we can't kill off COVID are technically correct, being able to make it as rare and preventable as MMR would be a pretty good endgame.  As a regular person, the distinction between not-an-issue like smallpox and not-an-issue like measles isn't that big of a deal to me -- and it's easy to get sloppy about it.  Either way, my body and my communty make a poor habitat for that shit.

The discussion among virologists is whether we  make COVID extinct like smallpox, or merely a non-issue outside of the anti-vaxxer community.  Either way means my family gets back to normal.  And, either way, getting vaccinated is the way to a better outcome.

There have been many failures in critical areas that have gotten us to today, from the original pathetic response, to bad decision after bad decision during the former president's reign of ignorance, to current politics encouraging large segments of the population to not vaccinate or wear masks which allowed the virus to mutate (not unexpected if you know anything about epidemiology), giving us the highly transmissible delta variant.

Pandemics can be complex enough without so much ignorance guiding individual choices.  There's no one and done (or even two and done).  We have a ways to go before we can consider ourselves in the clear.  Can you imagine if people willingly wore masks all along, and got the vaccine, we'd likely be a giant step closer to normalcy.

"We don't have to agree on specific cases but I agree that there are cases where tax money is wasted and I'd call it broken.  I think we can fix the tax system enough to mitigate that.  I don't go from ""Some things right now suck and we regret it"" to ""There is no way this can possibly be fixed, we shouldn't even try despite all that is to be gained.""  Nothing is perfect.  Private business is extremely wasteful in a lot of cases because they find a way to make it as expensive as possible to maximize profit since their priority is to make money and not the public good.  Sometimes these ends come in to conflict.

People scream COMMUNISM at Democratic Socialism and this is what they don't understand...Democratic Socialists aren't about making the government run everything or oppressive.  Communism is having the government run everything.  Democratic Socialism is about recognizing that the government does a better job at doing some things for cheaper while private business in a free market does other things extremely well that the government should meddle with as little as possible.  The exceptions are things like regulations that prevent economic crisis like what we saw in 2008, and not letting corporations do things like poison the water supply and air because they make a bit more money and don't care if people die because of it.  The government should make sure a single corporation doesn't form a monopoly and hijack the market with things like insulin shots that cost hundreds of dollars where they should only cost a few.  If there isn't a special consideration like this then the government shouldn't have any say and let consumer choice do its thing.",t2_4n5uu,ClutchReverie,0,1626389467.0,0,t1_h5byb8k,h5byb8k,False,raisinghellwithtrees,t3_ojvzun,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralillinois/comments/ojvzun/chicago_splitting_from_illinois_would_be_an/,"Chicago splitting from Illinois would be an economic disaster for downstate, says study",/r/centralillinois/comments/ojvzun/chicago_splitting_from_illinois_would_be_an/h5byb8k/,1,r/centralillinois,0,1

I'm talking about having tax money for the things government ought to be doing.  Some way, some how the government needs the money to do the things that it needs to do the right way to do it.  There are some things government is very good at doing that private business is terrible for and usually those things as it often has its own end that isn't necessarily the good of society.  
This is why not all taxes are created equal and some are more effective than others.  Effective governing takes some thought.  Pointing at the worst examples and then leaping to ""why even have taxes at all?"" is a false dilemma.  It really just sounds like you are complaining about having to pay taxes, because if you'd grow up and face facts then you'd see you really are just complaining.  You're just asking the government to do things and then whining when it needs the money to do what it needs to do.  The fact that not every single thing the government does you agree with doesn't make you oppressed.  We live in a democracy.  Not everything revolves around you personally.  This is how a peaceful society works.  If it bothers you \*that much\* you can move to another state where more people agree with you and more of your tax money is spent the way you approve of.    


I think that applies to all the cases you mentioned except the black market marijuana case which is sort of an odd case in general.  I think for that one the issue is the total price for what you are buying and not how much taxes there are.  If I could buy the same weed for the same price or cheaper legally, I wouldn't care some % of that is taxes.  All that matters to me is the total price.  It's true that currently black market weed is cheaper, but it's also a lot more plentiful.  Once legal weed business grows enough and some barriers are removed (like federal legalization to open up banking services, simple business growth) then legal weed will be more plentiful and therefore cheap.  On top of that it is a regulated substance so you get the benefit of knowing someone didn't cut it with something and that it's safe.  When that day comes there will be no reason to buy black market weed.  The point is of all this is to say that taxes are fine here too and despite these issues in its growing pains stage we're still seeing a windfall of tax money that we can use to buy all this infrastructure, educate these kids, make sure everyone is safe, and do anything else we need.  At the end of the day it's really either entitled or childish to accept this reality and then complain about the bill.  It's irresponsible to ignore this reality and break the system or manage it poorly simply so you pay less of a bill.  


Again, me accepting this does not mean I'm looking to spend more than I need.

"This is a perfect example of how conservative folks like yourselves think of freedom.  To you, freedom is being able to impose your values on everyone else and choose how their taxes should be spent, and/or manipulating the situation to where the rules never apply to you in practice yet you reap all of the benefit.  You feel entitled to have your way because historically you basically always have by virtue of having been the majority.  Your ""freedom"" in this case is going against what the majority of Illinoisans actually want by outlawing abortion and cannabis for others and paying next to nothing in taxes, while having no restrictions on your own freedom of choice (as you have now cemented your values for all in legislation) and also still expecting the state to have money to pay for your schools and roads and whatever else directly benefits you in your perception.  Money spent \*anywhere\* else is oppression imposed on you because you had to pay taxes and you think only of yourself.  You see your freedom as having the ultimate say in everything and ignoring everyone else.  This gets even more ridiculous in context where the state is having money issues because of a history of blowing money that was collected and designated to sustain our budget on what you wanted, without having to produce new funds to actually pay for it (aka taxes.)

In a nutshell, you break the budget as it was intended to work and then point it being broken as evidence that it is fundamentally flawed and that somehow only Democrats are to blame.  Meanwhile you stand by and wait for other people to clean up your mess and bitch and moan that at some point someone responsible is going to have to come in and make the tough but necessary call to balance the budget by collecting taxes \*somewhere,\* which is a mess you always leave for Democrats to clean up, and then you vilify them for having to do it.

Agreed. I lived on the eastern edge of Madison county and went to a Madison County Democrats mock caucus the night of the 2016 Iowa caucus.

I agree with everything you said except for the metro east voting democrat. The metro east is reliably like a straight-ticket GOP area.
