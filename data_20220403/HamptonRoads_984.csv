"Bluf: You can try to audit a photography course at one of the local colleges.


Before looking for a paid course. Have you tried to look online for photography technique courses?

Some things to look for are:
Camera basics (Aperture, shutter speed, ISO settings, properties of lens, etc.)
Photo composition (Rules of thirds, Dutch angle, etc.)
Techniques (Long exposure, lighting, body positions)

Then perhaps a little on photo touch ups with tools such as photshop, gimp, etc.

For the most part all you need to do is go out and take a ton of photos. Parse through them for the ones you like and just build up a feel for your camera and what draws your eye.

"True.  Well Chesapeake was never really a community to begin with.   Too big of an area for that.   If you want a community in this city,  look at the poor areas.   The areas with actual detached housing.  Not the areas with the McMansions. It's a big ask of cities like Chesapeake and Virginia Beach to have neighborhoods. Too often it's whatever climate the developers or the neighborhood associations create.   No independent housing in the wealthy areas, so it is what it is.

"If you are only commuting once a month through the tunnel, and especially if your meeting isn't like 8 or 9 in the morning, you wouldn't need to rule out a house on the pennisula. Commuter traffic can make it your commute around your hour-and-a-half limit going to the meeting, but you won't regularly hit longer than that until your way back, especially if you leave work before 3:30 or so. I absolutely don't want to downplay the annoyance of the tunnel, but actually you are more suited to deal with it than 90%+ of workers, and so you may not want to rule the pennisula out entirely. Hampton has a particularly awesome family attraction called Blue Bird Gap Farm which is free but is clean and wholesome and very fun for younger kids. Newport News has the Virginia Living Museum which is not free but worth it; it's a combination nature museum and native species zoo.

You also mentioned quiet and space, though, and that's not really a strength of Hampton and especially not Portsmouth. Suffolk would be the way to go to prioritize that, or even further out that way in the nearby counties, like the Smithfield area you were looking at. You have a commuting advantage and don't have to pay the extra to live in Chesapeake or Va Beach like those who drive every day would value more. For low density on pennisula, York is very expensive and Gloucester is way too far. And Williamsburg is of course both. But if that's not a must, you may well decide that Hampton, Portsmouth, or Newport News suits you well enough with a combination of a modest yard and proximity to parks and bike trails.

Crime patterns: Newport News, which I know the best as far as localities, avoid any street with a number! But tbh, the really best way I know to find a safe area, is to go on sites like [https://www.greatschools.org/](https://www.greatschools.org/) since there's a strong correlation between safe neighborhoods and good schools, and you'll probably need to know what the schools are like anyway.

"Hampton Roads derives from the roadstead formed by the confluence of the C. Bay with the James, Elizabeth, and Nansemond rivers. As a result, it doesn't really make much sense for Williamsburg to be considered officially a part of Hampton Roads.

Eventually I realized it was quicker to just ride my bike the ~5 miles down VBB to Military Circle Mall, so I started doing that instead. I would’ve ridden my bike the whole way if the roads allowed it, but that’s a whole other can of worms.

"True the elephant in the room going from Target to Wal-Mart.  Definitely not worth the walk because of traffic and because of the distance.  But I think those were the design cues from that time. The other malls in the area have similar designs.   

It's just super suburban on that property.   They could build all of it on a fraction of that land and build out the rest out as residential.  What the city has done with Greenbrier should be duplicated there.   They have the land to do it.  This would also create another urban area in Chesapeake.  I'd put around 10 mid rise residential on that property and cut my losses.   That may require removing half of the mall but as it is only half of the mall is in operation.

"Only thing keeping Sears/Kmart open is real estate.   They're into other things.   But their retail operation is dead on arrival.  They're on life support. 

JC Penny still has an opportunity to reinvent themselves.  Their issue is their primary consumer is like 50. Young people aren't going into JC Penny.   I'm 49 and I go in there for the nostalgia of it but I don't really like their lineup.   I might buy a pair of shoes out of there.   But they struggle with designer clothing.

"They still get foot traffic through there.   I go there once a week. Far more than I go to Military.   It's like the stores that are still there get a lot of traffic but most stores are closed so it looks dead but it isn't quite as bad as it seems.   

If there were just one other development in Portsmouth it would be the nail in the coffin. Logistically,  the location of the property relative to what's actually on the Portsmouth side is the major advantage.  So it benefits because of a lack of options in Portsmouth.   If you're on the Chesapeake side it makes more sense to get onto 64 and drive to Greenbrier.   

I would go to MacArthur but I see no need in paying the toll for the downtown plus paying for parking.   Once Nordstrom left there was no real reason to go.

My kids went to Hidenwood for two years.. it completely had them so behind. The school is terrible and dropped in rating from a 2/10 to a 1. The teachers hate it there (I volunteered once to help with picture day and they were all screaming and saying how much they hate their job and the kids not realizing I was a parent and not the photography team). My kids teachers would miss school on purpose and threaten the kids to never come back . The kids were pretty intense and lacked any manners. Bullying was not addressed.

"This. So much this. 

I would also say, racial tensions can sometimes be very high in Hampton too. Hampton is majority black, which I loved growing up in. If diversity matters to you, Hampton is fantastic. However,  there is a lot of...not necessarily red lining...but there can sometimes be divisive neighborhoods stemming back from the Civil rights era where some old neighbors really think this is ""their"" neighborhood 🙄

 Lots and lots of poverty in Hampton: 15%, so 1 or 6 people live in poverty, and same ratio for children under 18 - 1 in 6 kids live in poverty. 

As a kid, I recall lots of unstable family dynamics with my peers - divorce, abuse, kids living in a rental for six months (or as little as one month) and then just ""disappearing"" from my life (they had to hop somewhere else). Of my childhood friend group, 3 of 5 best friends got pregnant as teens, and only one went to college. Just...not a lot of positive role models or growth.  Hampton has a huge ROTC community, so lots of high school kids who want a way to move up/out tend to follow that route. 

Hampton is very very very pro military if you have any strong feelings about that too. 

There's things I love about Hampton. Downtown Hampton has amazing facilities. The water is beautiful and easily accessible, say compared to someplace like NN or Norfolk. I love how small the city is, you can know people from all over the city and run into them as you just do errands around town. Buckroe Beach is a jewel as is Fort Monroe.

"Hampton schools are kinda overrun. The administration don’t support the teachers much. Basically the kids can scream and act out and call teachers names and hit the teachers without much consequence at times. My ex-wife taught there and I grew up there moving from different parts of Hampton. The high schools are Phoebus, Kecoughtan, and Hampton High. I used to hate Newport News and think it was sketchy…..which kinda is in some parts. But once I moved to NN, whenever I look back at Hampton, I  just shudder. 

Also, Hampton has had political issues for decades. The city managers battle the elected city council, etc. There’s almost no room for growth as it’s a smaller city completely locked in by the York River on one side, Newport News and York County land locking it on others. Not much investment going on in most places and no room to grow causes Hampton to stagnate which affects funding for old, dated school systems that haven’t changed since I was attending decades ago. 

There are a lot of racial scars dating back to the Civil War itself. They finally changed the one local highways name after all the BLM protests shut down traffic. It was named Magruder Blvd. General Magruder was the Confederate General that upon having to evacuate Hampton when the Union was coming, burned down the entirety of Hampton so the former slaves being protected on Union enforced Fort Monroe would have no where to seek shelter. After the war, all the whites also came back to burned down Hampton and thought, “what a hero” for preventing blacks from finding shelter. So theres a lot of deep seated issues that date back even centuries. 

I grew up in Hampton and can’t believe anyone would say the schools are nice. Teach somewhere like York County, James City County on this side of the water or else Suffolk, Chesapeake or even Virginia Beach on the other side of the water. And live near where you work. You DO NOT WANT to be daily commuting through the tunnels and even now the James River Bridge. So many people worked on the Peninsula (Hampton, Newport News, Langley AFB, York County) but hated living here so they all built houses/subdivisions in Smithfield and Suffolk and now commute across the JRB making that commute a nightmare.

"Hampton Roads is a region consistenting of the seven sister cities, Hampton is one of those cities. Hampton might be...one of the worst of those cities (I say as a former Hamptonian).

The great thing about HR for a person not from the area is that....everyone is not from this area. Due to the military, lots and lots of transplants live throughout the region so its not like you are walking into a locality where ppl are ride or die Hampton/Virginian/Southern or make it difficult for transplants to settle down. 

Each sister city is really unique, depending on what kind of lifestyle you want. Do you want rural? Do you want a city? Do you want suburbs? Do you want a blend of both? 

The only thing I hate most about the area is traffic. Its one of the most congested areas in the states and during rush hour it can take awhile to get from area to area, so if you work on one side of the James River it would be best to live on that side of the James River. 

However, tons of beaches, wildlife preserves, hunting and fishing if you are into that, outdoor sports, racing, sports lifestyle no problem. Tons of musical acts go to Virginia Beach and the Norva in Norfolk, so you can have some fun.. Theres lots of festivals too..

I don’t take pleasure in shitting on this effort, but I’ve been there the first time I lived here. The tide needs support of the VB leaders and it must go to NOB. The logistics are tough, but if it doesn’t go to the base then what’s actually the incentive for anyone in the Beach?

">What's the metal scene like out here? I would love to attend some concerts this year.

I'm not entirely sure, sadly.  I'm an old fart who doesn't get out often anymore.  I'm up in Yorktown, and it seems most of the shows are on the south side.

I know there's a venue in Chesapeake that has some metal/hard-core shows regularly.  I think it's usually local bands, but I've forgotten the name.  Always wanted to check it out, but never got the chance.

Richmond seems to have the larger metal and goth/industrial scenes it seems (normally Fallout or Broadway I think).

As for gaming, there's pretty good communities around Hampton Roads for all kinds of board, card, and rpgs.

Depending what side of the water you're on, there's the Funny Bone in VA Beach and Cozzys Comedy Club in Newport News.  The Funny Bone typically gets more the A-lister headliners, Cozzy's is more of a hole in the wall/lesser known acts, but both are decent venues for a visit.  


The Virginia Living Museum and um...others? in Newport News are decent.  I don't really do the south side often at all.

"> They are renting a room and that includes equal part of the shared living space which would be reduced by an extra person living there, it’s not a hard concept and is standard. 

You don't seem to understand how room rental works in Virginia. The only thing that is rented is the actual room. If there is a bathroom that they share, it will be stated as such or if they have it to themselves. Other areas of the house that may be perceived as ""shared"" are house privileges and are not rented. This is usually dictated in a contract for room rentals.

>If they don’t have a lease, they are a shitty landlord and I’m not going to assume that of OP.

That's an inane assumption. I've known several people without leases with someone for years that have worked out just fine. I wouldn't recommend it but calling them shitty? That seems pretentious at best.

"Personally, I hate it here (I live in NN, but I also lived in Hampton), but that has to do with the fact that I prefer to live in large cities/heavily urban areas (or in rural environments) and can't STAND suburbia, esp. the chain-restaurant, strip mall, & sprawl that's so prevalent around here. It also doesn't help that I'm a radical pacifist living in the most militarized area in the world where almost everyone has some connection to the military.

I mean, I like my neighborhood, I like my neighbors, I like a few of the restaurants (Pho 83 is the best banh mi I've ever had), and I sure do like the cost of living (I had to move out of my preferred city because, on disability, I couldn't afford to live there anymore, esp. with housing costs), but for the most part, I wish I could move home. (It also doesn't help that we had a HORRENDOUS move (signed 3 leases in less than a year) and less than a year after we got settled, COVID hit and with us & our entire family being high-risk, we went into lock-down and pretty much haven't come out since. I've made 1 friend since I got here & I met them online & it was a total coincidence that they live in the area.)

I wish I could afford to live in Williamsburg (a place I've been going to since I was 3; my grandparents lived there & it feels a lot more like home), but there's SO little affordable housing and the stuff that is there is snatched up by college students (and 1 management agency discriminates against unmarried couples (I didn't think that was legal, but they do - they won't combine your incomes together)).

I'm trying not to hate too much, but you asked my thoughts so I'm being honest with you.

"These old cities, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Newport News, Suffolk, are experiencing gentrification which is a politically correct way of telling poor people to GTFO.  It is a slow process, but if you aren't paying attention you look up and you can't afford anything, and none of the people you grew up with are still around because they've all been priced out.  Nobody looks like you anymore.  People are wearing stuff you can't afford.  People are eating stuff you can't afford.  This is something that started to the far North of this region and to the far South and has closed in from both ends, the more recent examples being Charlotte and DC.  It will end here, which means people that can't cut it will either have to go back to the Midwest, if they can even afford anything there anymore, or go deep into the Appalachian mountains as that is the only thing affordable anymore.  And then they turn around and give people casinos which gives people a false sense of hope.

"Growth is slow.  A big part of that is the need for infrastructure.  The area does not have enough housing.  The area is also light on public transportation options; the bus is about as good as can be expected given the low ridership here but there is a need for light rail throughout the region to supplement the bus.  The issues are typical, if you build more people may use it but people are not paid enough to use much of anything.  So something like more bus routes or more frequent trips on existing routes may create induced demand for those that cannot afford a vehicle the same as more apartments may create induced demand for those that cannot afford a down payment on a house.  But if the cost to rent those apartments is high there may not be anyone to rent out those apartments to.

An ongoing argument is how entertainment options, particularly sports, in this region makes sense if people cannot afford the existing options.  For example, if Norfolk does build an arena, and ticket costs are high, which they should be because the infrastructure is new, do you go to see your favorite artist or do you wait for cheaper options?  Is it worth it to pay $20 to see your favorite artist, what about $200, what about $2,000?

Hampton Roads is turning into a place where people that already have money can park their cash at but a place where it is really difficult to obtain money to begin with.  Unless you're working in one of these industries that provides auxiliary services; computers, internet, medicine, healthcare, shipyards, television, radio, construction, hospitality; what are you really doing here?  A lot of the good paying federal jobs are in the Northern Virginia/DC area.  Really it is large enough if you can get a job there is plenty to do and enough work to go around but small enough that people still bump into each other and recognize people from some other church or some other job they worked at.  It isn't DC, it isn't Chicago, it isn't LA, it isn't NYC. But it is moving in that direction to take on those larger areas.  It is just missing the cultural forces and that feeling of being part of a large city.  Hampton Roads is still sort of that area of a ton of neighborhoods with their own distinct feeling, suburban in many parts although that is definitely changing.  I just fear that it will end up being a place with a bunch of people in front of their screens at home, making money, but that money having nothing to do with a fixed geographical location.  Yet it is enough to afford everything here.  Those that are left behind in that digital divide stuck commuting to work will get the raw end of that deal, complaining about the gas tax, complaining about the tolls, complaining about the traffic, and fighting against light rail and innovation because they're afraid it will make the area palatable to undesirables.  There is already a divide here between people that like it the way it is, people that want it the way that it was and those that want their own version of Chicago or NYC here; and you can't necessarily tell who is on what side based on whether they are native to this area or not.

If Hampton Roads wants quick growth, it is going to have to do something dramatic.  Maybe some large employer needs 200,000 employees.  Maybe there are other incentives.

"Stagnant as far as population growth is concerned. I do believe it is turning the corner though. Your points are pretty off. Each city has their share of 'big companies', but Downtown Norfolk is the region's CBD despite some trying to give it dually to it and Town Center.

I’d say the region as a whole is slow growth. We’re heavily dependent on defense spending which keeps things much more stable so we don’t feel the full force of a recession but also don’t benefit much when things are booming elsewhere. Portsmouth & Norfolk have been pretty stagnant to declining for decades while the former counties that incorporated in the 60s have experienced suburban growth (Virginia Beach/Chesapeake/Suffolk).,t2_ja1ri,Jackman_Bingo,0,1645735034.0,0,t1_hyaf2z4,hyaf2z4,True,Blazevale,t3_t0kh3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HamptonRoads/comments/t0kh3d/need_help_for_a_research_project_opinions/,Need help for a research project.

"This is going to be controversial, so I hope I don’t get many thumbs down 😅

The big one in our area is riverside… (though on the other side of the bridge, but many people do work and drive across for work) but I advise against it. My friends all just started there for about 26 I think. I did clinicals there for school and when I talked to the nurses there, they said you NEVER get pay raises at riverside. Ever. My current coworker told me that she worked in a speciality unit and they changed the way they paid them since they felt her unit was being “overpaid” and after 10 years of working there, she took a 30,000 pay cut and quit. 

The other large ones are sentara and bon secours. I don’t know a lot about sentara, but I heard it’s a lot like riverside. Bon secours seems really strange. I met an aide who said that while she worked there, they actually do random nicotine tests to make sure you don’t smoke on your off time. 

Those are the main hospital chains in the area. I’m Norfolk you have Norfolk general hospital (sentara) and chkd hospitals together.

"> I'm basing it off my experience... as a mortgage underwriter of 15 years.

If you are, which I'm going to give you a slight benefit of doubt here, but you are walking on a thin edge with no post history.

You are telling me that a person doing $30/hour is only capable of making up to a $1,600 per month payment while $17/hour per is only capable of up to $1,200? Something seems wonky..you say loose but the consistency is odd. 

>I've seen A LOT of positions that require a bachelor's degree, but start at $15/hr!! 

I've looked around..I see a ton of fast food places offer $15 STARTING and that is considered bottom rung. 

>For a single person with no kids, yes $60k is doable, but we aren't factoring in other bills either.

I'm factoring in other bills because I've done the calculations previously as I deal with real estate on a frequent enough basis in some capacity and it's insanely easy to look it up. You are looking at around $3,900 per month after taxes. If you think that's not more than enough to handle a mortgage, ALL your bills and expenses and set some aside then I'm also a Wallstreet tycoon for the past 15 years.

>What about single parents? Or families with multiple kids? Yes SOME people wait until their 30s or later to have kids, some don't, that doesn't change the fact that living costs, specifically housing, are rapidly increasing while wages are not.. There WILL be another housing and employment crisis unless one or the other changes.

I've clearly stated most are waiting until their 30's to have kids so the kid factor is gone and shouldn't be included. Families with multiple kids could also have other incomes and revenue streams so you are including different possibilities to throw off from the main point. 60k is well beyond what is reasonable to live in and thrive in this area specifically.

"> People need to be able to save in order to make a down payment in the first place, which is nearly impossible on $15/hour

That's not remotely true at all. I have multiple people I've known do just that. The folks that complain it's not possible usually are the ones who saddle themselves with unnecessary things. You can get a place in a less than desired area..struggle and move up. People were making $5.15 an hour in the early 2000's around here with apartments in the 800's and making it work. You are talking about almost triple the wages now but apartments have not tripled in the amount, they haven't even doubled.

>Yes it's possible to do those things, but if you don't have a degree it's not easy to find a job that pays that much

There is literally vendor/warehouse jobs open everywhere that don't require degrees that make way more than that. That's just off the top of my head. There is quite a few other places that offer higher too.

I think the disconnect is people aren't opening their horizons of what they are capable of. Possibilities in flourishing are usually things people hold themselves back with.

"This isn't anything new. This has been happening for at least the past 20 years. When I was thinking about getting my first apartment, **AVERAGE** 1 BR rent was around $500. Now? It's close to $900...almost **DOUBLE** in 20 years.

Have wages doubled for most people? I doubt it. It definitely is unsustainable. Thanks gentrification and NIMBY types.

Then what are you all going to do when you price all the workers out of HR? We're not going to do a 2-3 commute to be overworked and underpaid and underappreciated/undervalued and be screamed at by Karens. This has happened in resort towns in the Rockies for example. They've increased housing/cost of living so high, the workers can't afford to live there and thus can no longer afford to work there either and then they just leave entirely.

Something has to give, or we're going to have an exponential increase in the amount of homeless people. This is what happens when you let property owners charge whatever they want with no regulations in place and let NIMBY types prevent additional multi-unit construction that gasp, isn't $900/month or more.

How about when Trump knew china had a deadly pandemic brewing for over a month (actually more like 2 months) and sat on his thumb trying to will it away because he didn’t want it to impact the economy. And then he pumped the economy with ppp money and handouts which has led to inflation.

"Vaccines do a great deal. The vaccines were developed for the alpha variant. Since then we've seen delta in notable numbers and now the more easily transmissible omicron, for which vaccines are being prepared. Current vaccines provide very strong protection against Omicron causing a serial health issues in an infected person. Almost 100% of people being admitted to hospitals needing that level of care with Covid 19 right now are non vaccinated. 

There is a difference between getting Covid-19 and needing serious medical attention as a result, or even dying from it. 

[The current graph](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status) is worth looking at. In November and December, as compared to vaccinated and boostered individuals, those that were NOT vaccinated had a **13x greater risk** of acquiring Covid-19 and a **68x greater risk** of dying from the virus.

Never have and never will. Many years ago in paper auto trader days I went to look at a mustang there. I assumed the price had been misprinted as it was thousands over what an equivalent mustang was going for elsewhere. I talked to one of the salesmen about it and he told me that it wasn’t a misprint and they wouldn’t negotiate the price. So at this point I started showing him other nicer cars going for the same price and his response was to tell me they would find some young military member to buy it. I was livid that they were flaunting the fact they were taking advantage of young military members but they couldn’t care less.
