This is what happens when you give one party a carte blanche. Voters in this state have never in the last 20 years held elected officials accountable. I gurantee that ~15% of state tax revenue gets lost just due to incompetence and just plain not being responsible with taxpayer-funded time. Remember when the state auditor (or someone close to that title) was called out for spending hours at Brewsky's while on-the-clock?

"The Ponderosa in Weston, NE is awesome.

If you are going to be in Western Nebraska, check out Bootleg Brewers, its outside of Taylor, NE in the middle of nowhere by Calamus (which is a lake).

Some of the best wings you will have can be found in Surprise, NE at the Eagles Nest (only on Thursdays, hard to get a seat).

A couple good places to get a steak:

1. Nowhere Special Steakhouse and Saloon (Linwood, NE).
2. Leroy's Steakhouse in North Bend, NE.
3. Round the Bend Steakhouse (Outside of Ashland, NE). They specialize in Rocky Mountain Oysters here.

If you are going to get a steak, get a Ribeye, and for the love of God, don't get it cooked beyond Medium Rare. If you get it beyond that, I'd rather you not get it and ruin a perfectly good steak (this is coming from someone who's family raised cattle until recently and who's wifes family raises cattle). Also, NE is the top fat cattle state in the country, basically our stuff tastes better then those skinny Texas cows.

I am going to steer you to places outside of Omaha or Lincoln, support us small town folks.

Also, Nebraska has some great wine and wineries, if that is your cup of tea, you can hit up wineries all the way across NE.

"I spent 5.5 years reporting locally here. I used to call out any politician who didn't return calls, emails, etc. I tried to keep local entities accountable.

Eventually, I wrote a few stories about the local city council and how they weren't doing their job. The mayor called my editor who said I should give everyone a chance to state their side. I did. The same people from the first story refused to reply or return calls. I noted it in the story.

A few months later, there was another story I wrote. The mayor called again. I got written up for doing my freaking job, protested and the writeup went away. Next city council meeting, the editor refused to run two stories because it would make the council members look bad. I started looking for a new job.

In that time, I had the hospital's marketing team and lawyers run PR shit or just flat out refuse to talk to me when we knew things were going on. The last editor had a thing about not writing anything bad about the schools in the area, so things go swept under the rug.

That city council story made me cross a line I didn't want to cross. The last year I was there killed my joy and passion and was adversely affecting my mental and physical health. The paper lost an award-winning reporter in me. A coworker, who was a damned fine ag reporter and investigative reporter left the week before I did. The editor was let go a couple of weeks ago.

I feel you for trying to get information. It doesn't matter if it's local politicians, hospitals, businesses, etc. They all hide behind a wall and everyone protects everyone else. I just couldn't do it anymore.

Anyway, I just wanted to know that when I say, I feel you, I really do. I just couldn't do it anymore. Now, no one reports on the stuff that needs to be reported on and I stopped reading the local paper because it's mostly wire stuff and feel good stories. 

Best of luck to you though.

"My grandma never made bierrocks, but we love classic runza, and have made pretty comparable versions at home. I agree with this guys comment tho, salt, pepper (to taste) and onion flavoring.

We specifically mix 1 packet of onion soup mix with 2 pounds hamburger.  Also, to disagree with the current top voted comment, I would NOT use a mixture of beef and pork sausage, unless you know the pork sausage isnt heavily seasoned to begin with.  Also classic runza restaurant  version is 100% beef, so if you're going for authenticity, skip the sausage.  Not that beirricks with sausage mix is bad tho.

They really are not that difficult.  If the burger filling tastes fine before you wrap it up, it will taste fine when it's all done too.

Also they freeze amazingly well.  I feel its 100% worth it to make a ""triple"" batch and freezer bag up a bunch for another entire meal or if you bag them individually they make great lunches.  They usually microwave up pretty nice.

"Being pretty much landlocked, we're not real big on seafood around here - lol.

Many of Nebraska's early settlers were of Bohemian and/or German descent.  I wish I could tell you to try the old Bohemian Cafe, but they closed.  One vestige of Bohemian food you can still find are kolache - they are little round bread-like pastries with a generous dollop of filling in the middle.  My Bohemian grandmother used to make mostly poppy seed, apricot, and prune kolache, though you can also get them with apple, berry, and other fillings.  A typical Bohemian meal might include roast duck, goose, or pork with dumplings and kraut.  Grandma's often included rhubarb, gooseberry, or raspberry pie as she grew all 3 in her garden.

There is a meat market in Wahoo that makes really tasty natural casing wieners.  They also make jaternice and jelita, which are both Bohemian sausages.  I quite like their jaternice, not a fan of jelita.  You'd need a kitchen to prepare them if you want to enjoy any of those dishes, however.  Oh, and there is a bakery in Wahoo that makes pretty darned good kolache, too.  Also, the Wahoo Meat Market sells Applekraut - which is like sauerkraut that tastes a lot like applesauce.

There might still be some restaurants that can serve a good Bohemian or German meal.  Perhaps another redditor will come along and mention them.

Reminder: Nebraska is a ""semi-open"" primary state. If you are registered as non-partisan you may request a partisan primary ballot, either Democratic or Republican. However, the Nebraskan Republican party only allows non-partisans to vote in national office contests such as U.S. Representative, while the Democratic party allows your vote in all partisan contests in that election. If you want to influence statewide Republican primary contests like governor, SOS or AG, you'll need to register as a Republican. This should be done before April 22, 2022 if done by mail, at the DMV, etc. or by May 2 if registering in person at the Election Commission office.

"This is just my 2 cents, but I drive/deliver for FedEx and see our (Dixon County) local Sheriff's deputies about 4-5 times a day patrolling all over the paved/gravel/dirt roads.  I would say they are respected and have pretty good relationships with the people and communities of this county...

  
Whenever I hear about negative interactions with police officers it's almost always from the State Troopers that occasionally patrol this area.  I believe they are slightly antiquated and should be mostly reserved to the Interstate Highway (I80) and to help support the larger municipalities in the state when asked.

  
They do provide other important jobs such as fingerprinting, explosives permits, concealed handgun permits, AMBER Alerts, missing persons, criminal history/public records requests, etc. and definitely should continue to fund/focus these responsibilities.

Personally -- Fuck Nazis and anyone supporting Nazis. They are horrifically misguided people and their beliefs have no merit. I wish they were scared to fly such flags in the USA, let alone in the same city as me. It's ironic that if I vandalized their flag I could face consequences, yet they can freely hang a symbol of hate that my grandfather fought to oppose and lost friends in their fight to oppose.  

Volunteering as a mod in any community sub has nothing to do with my beliefs and what's right or wrong. I personally would avoid the house flying that flag if I came across it in the wild and caution friends to do the same. But regardless how I've come across it, I think they and anyone like them are racist, disgusting scum of the earth that should burn a thousands deaths in hell if they live their lives that way. They are the worst of what America has to offer and I am sad they exist as such ignorant, prejudiced, and hateful people. I don't wish death on them, I wish change for their soul. 

After looking up the removed post, the reason for removal was entirely to avoid allowing Nazis the space, platform, or time of day to get any audience -- supporting or opposing. `i.e. ignore the turbo-deranged and not give them notice.` It's fine if you disagree with that perspective and approach on this particular subject, but the intent meant well.

And I get that some will disagree with that approach to not allow the sub calling out Nazis. I don't disagree with such a perspective. But it's a fool's errand to then equate the well-intended effort to squelch giving Nazis airtime as 'the mods are sympathizers' -- we're a group of* independent thinking individuals. One does not speak for the whole. I don't speak for all mods now. I didn't even know about all of this until 20 minutes ago. It's too easy to be hasty and jump to the brashest possible conclusion, regardless of whether isn't even marginally correct.

"First of all, that's a bad faith argument. No one expects that for option number 1.

Option number 1 would be a descendant of German heritage from German immigrants who came here during that era of 1871-1918, and they're proud of their family's history as people who came here with nothing and built a life for themselves and their family.  As Omaha has a history of immigrants from all over Europe, this is a very likely scenario.

"**[Flag of Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Nazi_Germany)** 
 
 >The flag of Nazi Germany, officially the flag of the German Reich, featured a red background with a black swastika on a white disc. This flag came into use initially as the banner of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) after its foundation. Following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in 1933, this flag was adopted as one of the nation's dual national flags, the other being the black-white-red horizontal tricolor of the German Empire. This dual flag arrangement was ended on 15 September 1935, one year after the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg, and the Nazi flag became the only national flag of Germany.

"Part of it is a contrary tract out of opposition as required by the rules of the culture war and part of it is actually an attempt to inflict suffering as required by the rules of domination at any cost and I mean that literally.

The right is so blinded with hate and ignorance that they'll settle for the other guy losing something rather than gaining anything tangible themselves. Name one thing the right has done that actually improved someone's life rather than merely took something away from another group. I'll be over here if you think of something.

Those that actually control the right are not stupid. They're evil. The majority of their base isn't completely stupid either. Just sadly ignorant and as such they're vulnerable to manipulation. That's where acts like Bruce is performing come into play.

The last few years and have set new records in lows when it comes to behaviour and ""issues"". Bruce took the low road as a shortcut to power. It's bad attention is better than no attention on steroids. It's MLM 101. It's dumbed down and amped up to get more people involved and add to the division that allows those at the top to operate unimpeded by public backlash. In this case the amount of backlash generated actually powers the right rather than weakens it.

Very early in his career, Rod Serling learned that his scripts about social commentary would be rejected but if he cloaked them in horror or science fiction he could get them produced. Think 666 from the bible being code for Caesar. A good example of what's going on now as it was then is his story: [The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monsters_Are_Due_on_Maple_Street)

And *that* was the short version :-/

I got more. The culture war is carefully orchestrated for maximum efficiency.

I was a little taken aback and stare up at this beanstalk of a man with a rabbit of hair on his head. He then begins to greet the Bishop and completely steps in front of me in the space he pushed me out of.

Bishop gave me a sort of embarrassed smile and a quick wave and that was that.

"Covid ran the risk of uniting us so they flipped the script. Masks was a good one. Right up their with armbands and stars for quick and easy identification of friend or foe. No verbal exchange necessary. No understanding of actual politics required to be a participant in the war.  Just look to see what team color they're wearing and go from there.

Dumbing it down to that level allowed a greater number of  people to participate in the culture war. It was marketing genius.

All of which only supports my theory that Covid was allowed to burn unchecked for reasons other than  saving money on preparedness. They knew it was coming before it got here. The alphabet agencies, like the CIA, the NSA,  and all the others I can't think of right now,  aren't stupid. They watch every little thing all over the world. It's their job.
