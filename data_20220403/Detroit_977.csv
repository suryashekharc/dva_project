"Yes! Detroit has so much room to do and try many things! There is a great art and music scene in Detroit, and lots around to be inspired by. Every time I look around, there is something interesting to look at. I think Detroit is a great choice.

Cons to living in Detroit: you will need a car.

"The following is my own personal view.  I do not live in the city proper. I have traveled often in the USA but not a ton.   

Detroit is authentic.  The corporations have never really set up shop here.  We still have unique places to eat and shop.  We are real.    I love returning home from a flight and hearing the different languages from people.  I like heading into Detroit and seeing so many different people.  It makes me feel comfortable 

Other big cities that I have traveled to seem to be repeating stores like inside a mall.  To me that was very depressing.  The cities might have a hook that is marketed and the rest is just the same cookie cutter outfits that every big city has.  That makes me sad.

"Moved in about a month ago, I’ve really enjoyed my experience so far. There’s a grocery store connected to the lobby so that’s extremely convenient. The unit itself is sleek and spacious with the option of a balcony. Bathrooms are hotel quality, appliances are very above average, and maintenance is responsive. The location is amazing and gives a great view of the river from either side. Parking is expensive but it’s a gated garage so I know my car’s safe. Apartments are basically sound proof because of the concrete structure. Staff is friendly and generally competent. The gym and pool are shared with the hotel next door but they’re almost always empty. 

However, the elevator situation is not ideal. 33 stories and there are only 2 elevators running at a time. Some tenants Air Bnb their unit so it gets a little rowdy on the weekends with visitors. I don’t understand why management is fine with random people using it like a hotel.

Sorry, but when you were placed in a situation where you've had the border effectively closed to you from March 2020, to late last summer, just to have some COVID spreading asshole cause your wife's LTC facility to lockdown where you can't even see her, after already being unable to see her for about a year and a half, you learn to hate certain people. When you're throwing a baseball bat in the car, thinking something is about to go down at the border when protestors are trying to blockade it, and you're forced to either side with a government that's effectively separated you from your wife for a year and a half, or side with the super spreading freedumb convoy that effectively fucked you over when you finally could see your wife after eighteen months, and for all you know will try to do it again, because fuck everybody else but themselves, you learn to start feeling really negative about the country.

"Unfortunately, seems like you captured the reasoning for [this](https://www.biggestuscities.com/city/detroit-michigan):

*What was the peak population of Detroit?*
The peak population of Detroit was in 1950, when its population was 1,849,568. In 1950, Detroit was the 5th largest city in the US; now its fallen to the 24th largest city in the US. Detroit is currently 63.8% smaller than it was in 1950.

*How quickly is Detroit shrinking?*
Detroit has shrunk 29.1% since the year 2000. Detroit, Michigan's growth is extremely below average. 100% of similarly sized cities are growing faster since 2000.

"The city didn't actually pay money to build either of them.

The QLine is entirely privately owned, and the city has nothing to do with it.

The People Mover was 80% paid for by the federal Downtown People Mover Program, with a 20% state match. It was done by SEMTA (today known as SMART), but it was mismanaged. Part way through construction the city took it over and completed it. The city didn't pay the cost overruns.

During the same time, SEMTA had a regional transit plan that had $600 million (over $3 billion in 2022 dollars) of federal funding which was lost because of suburban political squabbling. It included a commuter rail station in the lower level of the Joe Louis Arena garage (you might have noticed before that there's a strange double height empty spot in the back of the ground floor), a commuter rail station just east of the Ren Cen where the parking garages are now. A light rail line from either Royal Oak or 8 Mile, which would have also gone down Jefferson to near Grand Boulevard. BRT lines, and general bus improvements.

"It's just that so much of the area is freeway and single family houses. You'd have to get an unrealistic amount of value from the available developable land. Also I think there would be opposition to building the guideway through Corktown.

What might make more sense is extending starting from the Joe Louis Arena Station, with a station at Jefferson and Fort, and a station at MCS. It would be cheaper to build on top of the park and rail right of way, and it would put the stations directly at the places where there is more development opportunity.

The issue would be how much work it would take to convert the area from industrial to residential, and also how many businesses would be displaced, when the same amount of development could go elsewhere in areas that are already ready for it.

I do think ideally there would be a line in that direction. The airport is an important connection, and Dearborn is already a major employment node and destination and still has a ton of open land. It would also really improve the bus network in the west side of Detroit and suburban Wayne County.

"Statistics are statistics, they can tell any story you want. Are you just looking for anecdotes about people getting harassed by police or maybe somebody using a slur towards them in public? 

You’re not going to find a place in this country that doesn’t have racism. The worst parts of it aren’t overt like that, they exist in far more nefarious ways. Not getting job interviews because of your name, a realtor not showing you homes in certain areas. 

You might get one person responding that they had an ugly neighbor who made them feel so uncomfortable they had to move and you might find the next person on the next block who loves their neighborhood. 

I believe all of this is a personal experience, not something you can just quantify for somebody else. A situation that makes one person feel super uncomfortable might not bother the next person at all. 

How do you handle experiences? Does the sight of a Trump 2024 sign in a yard make you very uneasy, or do you not care?

"The capital cost numbers I used are very close to being accurate. You can look at page 346 of [Surrey Rapid Transit Study Phase 2 Alternatives Evaluation](https://skytrainforsurrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/surrey_rapid_transit_study_phase_2_alternatives_evaluation.pdf). It doesn't contain how much stations cost, but a different document did. RR 1 and RR 3 are pure SkyTrain but contain a different amount of tracks and stations. 

$90-105 per mile of elevated guideway. Their guideway would be about twice as tall as ours though, because their station design has an intermediate mezzanine level between the ground and the platforms. For that reason I've used $90. 

$22 per station (specifically, [Lincoln Station](https://www.archdaily.com/804019/evergreen-line-stations-perkins-plus-will?ad_source=myarchdaily&ad_medium=bookmark-show&ad_content=current-user)). However, their stations are 80 meters (262 feet) long. Our current platforms are 80 feet, but for the sake of future capacity, my stations are 120 feet. I use the station layout shown [here](https://www.arup.com/perspectives/material-change-can-timber-play-a-role-in-sustainable-rail-infrastructure). A similar station has been built [here](https://www.arup.com/projects/orientkaj-and-nordhavn-metro-stations). Since the stations are roughly half as big I use $11 for the station cost, although you can see my stations are not just smaller but simpler. 

$3.5 per vehicle. I'm pretty sure they were able to get cheaper vehicles because of the massive orders they were put in. The People Mover recently cited $4.5-5 is pretty standard for metro vehicles in general. Technically you could run decent service without getting more vehicles, but from a transportation planning point of view, this extension requires painless transfers from buses, so the very high frequencies are important.  

$0.65 per vehicle for the operations and maintenance facility. Our current one is only half full, so we don't need a new one.

My extension has 6 stations, 2.75 miles of guideway, and 12 vehicles. That's $363.5 million. That's $475 after adjusting for inflation since 2010. Add some amount for soft costs and contingency and I figure $500-600. 

There's the caveat that I mentioned that all projects are unique, and the costs depend on the specifics of the project, and what the cost of concrete and steel and labor are at that time. 

&#x200B;

The SkyTrain, the Copenhagen Metro, and a People Mover expansion, are what are called light metros. Basically, a 10 vehicle train coming every 10 minutes provides the same capacity as a 2 vehicle train coming every 2 minutes, but the 2 vehicle trains need shorter platforms. Stations are one of the most expensive parts of building a metro, so having stations that cost 20% as much saves a lot of money. 

You can calculate the capacity of a system by multiplying the capacity of each train by the trains per hour. The People Mover and Seattle's light rail actually have about the same max capacities. Except in order to get that high of capacity Seattle would have a very hard time operating it reliably, because a large section is at grade in a road median, and also because their station designs don't allow for that kind of passenger flow. 

It's also worth noting that even though the People Mover's vehicles are 35 years old and are costing more money to maintain, the People Mover actually has lower operating costs than Seattle's light rail. Each of their vehicles costs $494.10 per hour to run and hold 97 passengers. Ours cost $325 per hour and hold 80 passengers. The SkyTrain is only $102 per hour.",t2_v49wk2k,Jasoncw87,0,1648863859.0,0,t1_i3259ow,i3259ow,False,Live-Telephone-5431,t3_tszh59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/tszh59/people_mover_needs_100m_in_upgrades_and_more/,People Mover needs $100M in upgrades and more Detroit riders,/r/Detroit/comments/tszh59/people_mover_needs_100m_in_upgrades_and_more/i3259ow/,1,r/Detroit,0,1

"Brooklyn? I would have suggested corktown.

West Dearborn has turned into a solid suburb due to how the community has taken care and invested in it over the last 20 or so years.

Mostly, you'll want to go east to Detroit or farther west to Ann Arbor for fun.

Basically explore these areas and you'll have more than enough to do for a while:

- Downtown Detroit
- Midtown
- Corktown
- Ferndale 
- Royal Oak
- Birmingham
- Ann Arbor downtown
- Ann Arbor parks
- State Parks

"I understand there are federal funds for this - but it takes a lot of work to try and get those federal funds for your locals only transit.  I also understand that money from the feds still isn't free money (you and I pay for that).  

>$3.7 million a year in new tax revenue. 

Cost of new tracks (at grade - not elevated) are $15-100M per mile.  I'm in Denver, and we just spent $6.5B on 122 miles of rail and BRT, and much of that was on existing rail corridor or in the eastern plains (not through residential like any expansion of the People Mover would require).

> That new apartment building at Harbortown has a taxable value of $7 million, and would make about $0.5 million. It was 134 units, so $0.1m in income tax. Obviously, if higher value developments, and wealthier people moved in, the amount would be higher. 

There are cities with booming populations (Seattle, Austin, Denver) that can't make the finances work - but you think Detroit could?


> Fares from new ridership (not transfers from existing bus ridership) could generate a few million a year in fares. 

Bullshit.  The only somewhat sustaining fares are from NYC.  No other system, not even Chicago breaks even from operating cost, much less maintenance.  And you can't tell me you think Detroit should build a MTA system, right?  That would be trillions.  Have you looked into any of this?

> With moderate property value increases, moderate new development and residential growth, and moderate ridership, there would be enough to cover most or all of the capital costs.

You probably could put a small modern cinema there but you'd have to figure out how to handle parking to make it work.

That's unfortunate, yeah I did notice the marque showed 2 auditoriums, pretty rare for those old theaters. Detroit is about to make a bigger mistake with the United Artist theater downtown.

"Here is the list of federal programs: [https://www.transit.dot.gov/grants](https://www.transit.dot.gov/grants) During the Obama administration they were bending over backwards trying to support transit here but we couldn't get our act together for the local funding. 

The big one is the Capital Investment Grant Program, which is competitive/discretionary and distributes a fixed amount of money to projects across the country. They could cover up to 60%. 

For the local side of things, the area along the route, excluding downtown, has a taxable value of about $350 million. If overall property values were raised 15% (the equivalent of rent going from $1,500 a month to $1,725), that would create about $3.7 million a year in new tax revenue. 

New developments would add to that. Orleans Landing is $90m. If a TIF were created, every new Orleans Landing would create about $0.6m in property taxes every year. It has 278 units. If the occupants of each unit make $30,000 a year, that's $0.2 million a year in income tax.

That new apartment building at Harbortown has a taxable value of $7 million, and would make about $0.5 million. It was 134 units, so $0.1m in income tax. Obviously, if higher value developments, and wealthier people moved in, the amount would be higher. 

Fares from new ridership (not transfers from existing bus ridership) could generate a few million a year in fares. 22,000 people live along the route. If 1/3rd of the people who both lived and worked along the route took the People Mover, and everyone else took the People Mover only once a week, it would create $1.5m in new fares. There's also people visiting the Riverwalk, Belle Isle, and Chene Park. There are hotels, a hospital, grocery stores, restaurants, schools. 

With moderate property value increases, moderate new development and residential growth, and moderate ridership, there would be enough to cover most or all of the capital costs.",t2_v49wk2k,Jasoncw87,0,1648845628.0,0,t1_i3131hu,i3131hu,False,Live-Telephone-5431,t3_tszh59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/tszh59/people_mover_needs_100m_in_upgrades_and_more/,People Mover needs $100M in upgrades and more Detroit riders,/r/Detroit/comments/tszh59/people_mover_needs_100m_in_upgrades_and_more/i3131hu/,1,r/Detroit,0,1

"Disclaimer: not an accountant, not your accountant.

Ask your workplace if they'll withhold Detroit taxes for you (they'll figure out the rate based on where you live and work). A lot of software seems to support municipal tax withholding (my work does), and then you don't have to think about it; you just file city taxes as well come tax season. If you have an accountant or halfway savvy tax software (TurboTax, etc.), this will also be handled for you.

If your work does not withhold, you'll have to do it yourself and pay **quarterly**.

"Democrat supported Unions predominate in industrial Detroit drove the auto manufacturers and other factories out of the city because what company in their right mind wants to pay a pension for some junkie installing mufflers on trucks for the next 20 years after they retire???  It only makes sense to send that job to Mexico for $3 an hr or to a right to work state where a 401K and financial literacy can do the same job.   Hurr Durrr union power....si señor!

Obviously the police also weren't funded or motivated enough to conquer the crime epidemic...probably because it's by design.

It's a containment zone, keep everyone poor, have them vote a certain way, a solid voting base, racial gerrymandering.

You have to be an idiot to live there, and that's how Detroit votes, like idiots....for their own destruction.  Bon Appetit.

""Many of Detroit’s problems resulted from a lack of political competition. Democrats have dominated the city council, and there’s been a Democratic mayor since 1962. One-party government quickly became bad government, featuring a stream of liberal, blue-state policies such as sweet deals for government unions. Now, though, the bill has come due for these liberal policies.  
  
“For decades, Detroit sustained itself through the usual suspects of bad fiscal management: unaffordable borrowing, state grant schemes, raising taxes, and deferring public pension contributions rather than cutting city spending,” explain Heritage’s Alison Acosta Fraser and Rachel Greszler. “But Detroit’s tragic downward cycle has reached its end.”""",t2_4nos17mp,Locutus_Picard,0,1648835873.0,0,t1_i30fhch,i30fhch,False,princessvespa42,t3_tnos8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/tnos8i/midterm_political_ads/,Midterm political ads,/r/Detroit/comments/tnos8i/midterm_political_ads/i30fhch/,1,r/Detroit,0,1

You're proving my point, 90% of Detroiters are voting for their own destruction.  Look, you can't deny the place is a bombed out shithole outside of the city with block and blocks of razed homes unlike anywhere else in the US. 

Detroit is always one politician away from becoming normal again.  What has happened besides a bajillion homes being knocked down and the city revitalized for businesses (not for the poors). 

All that will happen is a few more trees will get planted and a new mural here and there.  It's a containment zone and you're living in it, defending it lol.
