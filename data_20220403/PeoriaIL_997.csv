Can't comment on Le Peep specifically, but I've worked in the service industry most of my (tbf, rather short) life in Peoria and I do well enough. Certainly, it sucks for a lot of reasons, & I'm in a low tax bracket, for sure, but I get by great. IMO the service industry is great in Peoria. And I think it's because the cost of living is so low.

"I think they’re worthwhile. The prolonged outages are rare, but can do a ton of damage to the house. Usually such outages are during extreme weather (rainstorms, ice, heat). If you have a sump pump, the battery backup won’t last more than a day, then your house floods. Without heat for 3-4 days in sub-zero temps… your pipes will definitely burst. Without AC for a few days in extreme heat… materials warp, finishes peel, and creates opportunity for condensation and mold once cooling kicks back on. Your homeowner’s insurance may cover a lot of the damage, but you’ll get a discount for having a backup and save yourself the hassle of claims and repairs.

"It just seems ironic that they paint themselves as defenders of democracy, but also feel the need to nationalize the narrative out of fear that Russian influence will not divide their narrative. It seems dangerous to only provide one narrative to the people and give them a false sense of the reality of the current situation. Ukraine has no incentive to be neutral in their coverage and instead will be very biased toward their objectives. I highly doubt the motivation for shutting down independent media is due to safety concerns.

That's the hope, but overall it is concerning that he views freedom of the press as a convenience that can be done away with when necessary.

"In war time, the battle for narrative is nearly as important as what is actually happening on the ground. If the Ukrainian government can’t control the media, then independent outlets are in danger of Russian influence. Censorship is an important weapon to have in your arsenal, and it could very well be important to the integrity of their military operations and safety of their citizens. Russia has been targeting civilian structures and independent media could very well do more harm than good right now.

Also, foreign media still has a presence there.

"My point was there are no articles you can point to that don't have some sort of bias or opinion in them. Regardless of the source someone will say it has some sort of lean. It's a fool errand to think you can find an objective source on every topic. 

That's not what it means. I literally explained it in my response to you that I said would because that was not the topic at hand. Yes I condemn Russia, but the point I was making was about Zelenskyy so it did not apply. The implied piece of that sentence is "" I'd condemn Russia (if that were the point of discussion)....""

I don't disagree with your argument about it potentially causing harm, no doubt having Russian propaganda is bad for Ukraine's side.

I find it hard to believe that you don’t see what would happen if Ukraine lets pro-Russian voices spread their own propaganda in an active war zone.  Russia is known for their powerful disinformation and far flung spies and such.  Flooding the media with those voices is 100% something they’d do and could cause some serious issues.

And I respectfully disagree that nationalizing media isn't a bad idea. You don't get to pick and choose when you get to censor voices. If there's pro-russian voices they deserve to be heard and shot down in the court of public opinion, but nationalizing one voice turns the media into a propaganda machine that will misinform the public.

I informed him my home had recently been inspected as it was a new purchase and the inspection found zero issues. He started measuring between existing deck spindles. The whole thing felt very icky.

I noped out. I wish I remembered their name, but I don't. The whole experience put me off getting another quote. They were on the top of the Google list last year, began with P I think.

"MORTON – The Morton School District must take steps to ensure that Morton High School female and male student-athletes have equal opportunities, facilities, equipment and supplies.


That's the bottom line of a resolution agreement reached between the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights and the district after a Title IX complaint was filed against the district last year by former Morton High School softball coach Gigi MacIntosh.

An investigation by the OCR that began in December resulted in the agreement, which was approved March 8 by the Morton School Board by a unanimous vote.

Title IX, a federal law enacted in 1972, prohibits discrimination based on sex in any education program or activity that receives federal funding.

MacIntosh and Morton Superintendent Jeff Hill view the agreement between the OCR and district differently, but both believe it will produce positive results.

""I'm pleased with the outcome of the OCR's investigation,"" MacIntosh said. ""The OCR is unbiased. It does fact-finding. It isn't on my side or the district's side. It did a great job with this investigation considering it couldn't do it in-person because of the pandemic.

""I'm sad, though, that an outsider had to come in 50 years after Title IX passed and point out the sports inequities in the district. The administrators should have been doing their job.""

MacIntosh said the ball is now in the district's court ""and hopefully the district will do better and girls will feel they matter.""


Hill said the district cooperated fully with OCR investigators and he found it telling that the agreement doesn't have any findings of non-compliance with Title IX, ""just things that we need to pay attention to.

""We've been asked to do things we typically do formally or informally. Now we'll formalize everything,"" Hill said. ""We're always assessing our sports facilities and equipment, and typically ask students about their sports interests. We're always working to make sure everything is equitable.""

Here's what the OCR has asked the district to do:

Provide Title IX training by July 1 for district staff members responsible for the athletic programs at Morton High School and Morton Junior High School including principals, athletic directors, business managers/staff who work with athletic budgets, and coaches.

Offer sports that accommodate the interests of female and male students at Morton High School no later than the 2024-25 school year. The district must conduct a survey of students within 90 days after approving the agreement to gauge athletic interests.

Provide equal locker rooms, practice and competition facilities for Morton High School and Morton Junior High female and male student-athletes by the 2024-25 school year.

Provide equal equipment and supplies for female and male student-athletes at Morton High School by the 2022-23 school year.

The district must meet deadlines to demonstrate its progress.

Hill said the Title IX training will be part of ongoing professional development for district employees.


What the investigation found
MacIntosh said the request from the OCR for Title IX training ""speaks volumes.""

In an email written to MacIntosh that she provided to the Journal Star, the OCR investigation team expressed concerns about:

Sports participation rates among Morton High School female students.

A difference in amenities between the Morton High School varsity softball diamond at Birchwood Park and the Morton High School varsity baseball diamond at Westwood Park.

The fact that ""boys teams (at Morton High School) are allocated substantially more funds for supplies and equipment both overall and per athletic participant than girls teams.""

According to the OCR investigation, the Morton High School student ratio in the 2020-21 school year was 50.9% male to 49.1% female, but competitive sports participation rates were 61.4% male to 38.6% female.

Birchwood Park and Westwood Park are Morton Park District facilities. The Morton Girls Softball Association and Morton Youth Baseball Association have contributed to the construction and upkeep of the varsity softball and baseball diamonds.


However, the diamonds are subject to Title IX scrutiny because they're used by Morton School District teams. The district receives federal funds.

The OCR investigation noted that the district has taken steps in recent months to improve the Birchwood Park varsity softball diamond including replacing the netting in the batting cages, working with the park district to install climate-controlled restrooms, changing the outfield grass so there can be IHSA post-season play, and removing a pond ""in which geese congregated resulting in goose droppings on the facility.""

However, ""spectator viewing opportunities remain inferior at Birchwood Park as compared to other district ... competition facilities and the facility has fewer amenities as compared to the (varsity) baseball field (at Westwood Park).""

Hill said the district has demonstrated its commitment to Morton High School female student-athletes by spending about $1 million over the past several years renovating the Birchwood Park varsity softball diamond.


The district's sports equipment and supply budget for Morton High School for the 2020-21 school year was $68,850, with $49,625 allocated to boys teams, $18,150 to girls teams and $1,075 to the combined boys and girls cross country teams, according to the OCR investigation.

Investigators also noted more frequent uniform replacements for the boys basketball team compared to the girls basketball team over the past three school years.

MacIntosh said she filed the Title IX complaint against the district as a last resort after investigating concerns brought to her attention by a community member, sending emails detailing equity issues to district administrators, meeting with administrators at Birchwood Park and speaking at a School Board meeting.

""I waited for a positive response to fix the equity issues. No response back,"" she said. ""So I filed a Title IX complaint with the OCR.""

My brother and I launched the Oliver’s Trivia Series in 2019, and it has been an incredibly successful project that we have a great time running.

We are already drawing fans from many other states, and at the rate at which tickets are selling, we expect a sellout.

"Yep this dude is a giant douche bag. Worked for him as well. 

A non-exhaustive list of things this diaper person has done:

We had to put business expenses on credits cards that would be maxed out. 

He refused to pay at least one employee the raise amount that was agreed upon. 

He has been seen with white powder under his nose during work hours. 

He took every bit of credit away from the people that ACTUALLY did all of the work in regards to COVID: The lab professionals and IT department in Reditus and all of the factory workers of PAL (orthotics company) making faceshields. 

Apparently he's made over $200 million off of COVID testing. Complete pandemic profiteering.

He refused to compensate a previous business partner over $25,000 in travel and sales fees.

He swindled money from a local physician. 

Also, the guy that wrote the software in the IT department for the PCR machine interface was given no additional compensation even though this was not a part of his job requirements.

Even look at a place like Tennessee where housing is affordable and the weather not so bleak (I say this as a Canadian who lives here, weather would be fine if it got cold enough to skate outdoors more than few weeks or we had hills for skiing locally etc, even sledding is limited as we don't really get that much snow consistently.

"I transplanted here about 10 years ago now, from the Chicago suburbs. Still love it!  


It's got most of the perks of living in a big city, easy access to some actual big cities, but without the cost of living. The pace of life is just slower too, and folks are by-and-large genuinely nice.  


It's not as ""hopping"" as a city center, or even a sprawling suburb. If you and the family like to get out and do stuff, there's definitely some good options, but you will have to be a bit more intentional about finding the events. But they're there for sure.  


Other comments about the weather are spot-on. The rate at which it can change is mind boggling. Two years back, a good friend of mine noted that in a 3 or 4 month span, we went from having temps at -30F all the way up to 100F. Ya learn to just be flexible.   


Job market right now still seems really awesome, no matter what work you do. That won't last indefinitely, but it's a great time to get your foot in the door. While Caterpillar and the hospitals do make up a huge chunk of the jobs, there are plenty of chains and smaller businesses around too.  


I can't promise it'll fix all your woes.

The traffic is minimal, the people are warm and friendly and the housing prices are low in comparison to anything on the West Coast.  We don't have the ocean, or mountains, or deserts, but we do have nice lakes, rivers, forests, hiking trails, nice restaurants, and no crowds. The hospitals are excellent also.  And it is only 2 1/2 hours to Chicago, St Louis, and Indianapolis.  My only recommendation is to look at the surrounding areas to Peoria, like Dunlap, Washington and East Peoria.

"I'm a born and raised Peoria local and I have never moved out of the area so maybe take that into consideration with what I'm about to say.

Peoria is good if you are looking to live somewhere cheap and you don't care about outdoor activities for most of the year. I am someone who requires sunlight as much as possible to keep a positive outlook on life and Peoria (and by extension Central IL) has been hell in that regard. The winters are fucking brutal and most of the time it remains cold and dreary well into April. Weather patterns are unpredictable and you will often get 70 degree days followed swiftly by <32 degree snow storms in the Spring/Fall. The wind is almost always a major factor to account for and, accompanied by high humidity, makes for some blisteringly cold days.

Then comes summer. I personally don't mind the summers as they are usually pretty sunny but they are HUMID. If you've ever been to the south and experienced a summer there its very similar but without as many places for shade. Now the reason I say that you should move here if you don't care about outdoor activities is partially bc of the weather, but it is also because of the topography of the area. IL is actually the second flattest state in the country only outdone by FL and that is incredibly apparent in Central IL. Peoria itself is beautiful and the Illinois river valley is a scenic place to be when the weather is good, but everything (and I do mean EVERYTHING) outside of the valley is miles on miles of endless corn fields. There is no nature to speak of and you will get used to the feeling of deja vu while driving down the highway and feeling like you've passed the same farmhouse and field multiple times that day. I've seen people recommending Blo/No as an alternative to Peoria and I have personally lived there. It is by far the most bland and lifeless scenery out of the whole area. I would not recommend it unless (see beginning of comment).

It all comes down to what you value of course and you will find a hell of a deal if you want to buy a house here. Just know that there is a reason it's so cheap here.

Also to address your concerns about drugs and homeless people where you're from, unfortunately that's the case for most major cities that don't experience major winter weather. Many northern cities used to have policies of underfunding their homeless services and instead paying for bus tickets to ship their homeless to southern cities where they could survive on the street year-round. I can't speak to their current policies unfortunately. There are plenty of struggling homeless people and drug addicts coming from Central IL, they are just well hidden or moved elsewhere.",t2_15kz6mxq,ManDooku,0,1647387529.0,0,t1_i0tfydb,i0tfydb,True,NoBuilder9047,t3_tf0go0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tf0go0/hello_there_from_california/,hello there from California,/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tf0go0/hello_there_from_california/i0tfydb/,3,r/PeoriaIL,0,3

"“The simple irony here is that we have grown adults throwing temper tantrums over the Founding Fathers,” said a school board member during a private meeting Monday evening, “when what they really need to get mad about is the fact they haven’t FOUND any bitches.” In contrast, most D150 students affected by the name changes seem unfazed.

“I don’t care,” said Payton Martinez, a fifth-grader at soon-to-be Reservoir Gifted Academy, weighing in on the new name for Washington Gifted School.

In fact, a poll regarding the name change, conducted by The City of Peoria found that 87% of kids “don’t care”, while 10% “think it will be cool.” The remaining three percent were curious about whether our correspondent had games on their phone and couldn’t be bothered for an opinion one way or the other.

“The fact that the young people going to these schools have no opinion on the matter really draws the focus onto the creeps on the internet that are all of a sudden so infatuated with elementary schools,” another school board member said in a Tuesday morning video call to The City. “I just can’t help but ask, ‘why are you, a grown man, so interested in and getting defensive over elementary schools?’ It seems kind of suspect, in a real pedophile-type of way. I’m happy to say, however, we are working closely with the Peoria Police Department to document these comments and put these individuals on a watchlist in order to protect our kids. These childless freaks clearly have a mental health disease or something, to be getting this hot and bothered over elementary schools, and then to get defensive when they’re pressed on the issue. Just nasty.”

This story will be updated, so please like and share to spread the news on this polarizing event.

EDIT: I suppose after seeing all of these comments, I need to address the seemingly-invisible elephant in the room: 

Please consider the fact that this is parody and in no way real. The statistics are made up, the quotes are made up, no school board member made any such comments. There is no “Payton Martinez” in fifth grade at Washington Gifted School (well maybe not, I didn’t check honestly). It was fabricated to poke fun at the absolute absurdity that is the struggle between people who care way too much about the changing names of elementary schools, and the inability of the school board to act in a meaningful way that will actually benefit kids.",t2_fe00th67,TheCityofPeoria,0,1647380987.0,0,t1_i0t02va,i0t02va,True,TheCityofPeoria,t3_tf1bso,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tf1bso/d150_school_board_members_accused_of_erasing/,D150 School Board members accused of erasing history of Founding Fathers [MIC],/r/PeoriaIL/comments/tf1bso/d150_school_board_members_accused_of_erasing/i0t02va/,8,r/PeoriaIL,0,8
