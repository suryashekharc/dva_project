"First off, I can't say if this WOMAN is the answer, but the city needs better than that BOY Hermann.

Hermann needs to go.  Even without the lawsuit and his questionable ethics, his conviction rate is below the national average.  I've read stories since his tenure about all charges being dropped because a suspect asked for a speedy trial and prosecution staff didn't file paperwork to request a delay in a timely fashion.  They've had to drop enhanced charges for gun possesion because staff didn't turn evidence over to the defense attorneys.  There's the whole Aleah Beckerle and Shane Breedlove murders that are unanswered.  A man who killed his wife and attempted to kill his daughters was nearly granted another trial because of juror misconduct.  The man who severely beat and burned his infant son had his first trial end in a hung jury before getting a conviction in a second trial - something that cost us taxpayers because the prosecutor's office couldn't get it right the first time.  These are literally off the top of my head, but there's a lot more to find if you do the digging.

"I was offered a job there back in the old days back about 2000. At that time I didn't have degree in business and accounting and was working in another manufacturing plant in the auto industry and it would have been a pay raise for me. It did seem to be hard work when we went and did the pre employment tests and orientation back then. Then again I was already doing that so I was in good enough shape. 

However, Princeton totally sealed the deal when I was spent a bit of time in that town. Even from where I am from in South Central Indiana in the Salem/Bedford area it was like going back in time to the 1960s or so and Vincennes then was another town that reminded me of the 1950s or 1960s with the appearances of the town. I hope it has improved since then since its been about 15 years since I was last in Princeton. I just remember how run down and dumpy the whole place was at least back then. Maybe it has improved since then. Another thing I was told by some locals was that everything there was so economically depressed even for that time in 2000 when the US economy was doing pretty well with Clinton in charge.

Princeton wasn't back then all that much to write home about even though my dad was encouraging me to take the job but I also said to him that I didn't think too much of the community over there from first sight and a few other places around there didn't look all that hot either.",t2_ekbrbjqi,MightyMouseIN,0,1648766822.0,0,t1_i2wslxz,i2wslxz,False,fater1014,t3_ts4zzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/ts4zzf/anybody_have_any_insider_information_on_toyota/,Anybody have any insider information on Toyota and whether it’s worth working there?,/r/evansville/comments/ts4zzf/anybody_have_any_insider_information_on_toyota/i2wslxz/,2,r/evansville,0,2

"I work there. It's a overall not a decent place to work. They've made some changes recently to get people in the door. so you get a sign on bonus, a bonus for moving closer to the plant, PTO from the get go, access to the car discount program, and the same insurance as regular toyota that good insurance. The pay is pretty good as well. I actually really like it. There are some downsides to it. We work a lot. Currently, I really never know when I'll be off work. We can work up to 2.5 hours of over time, so it's just variable. BUT the pay check from that is super nice. Additionally, East plant (where I am) is being moved to 8 hour shifts early next year. So we will have set end times unless you volunteer (or are voluntold, tho enough people are already begging for OT that I'm not sure how much that will happen across the plant). West plant is switching to Lexus and will remain on the 2 shift options.

&#x200B;

Currently, they're moving people over from track (variable) pretty quickly depending on department.

"I've worked there for nine years. Expectations are everything.  Almost any other factory will have you working harder for a lot less money in much worse condition, but some people just aren't cut out for manufacturing or have no idea what to expect.

There is one big negative that they need to understand. Toyota hires people through what they call their track program. You'll be in this until they transition you to full time, probably within a year. You'll be offered the same benefits as full time employees but you will pay extremely high premiums for family coverage. When I hired in they were using a staffing company for their variable workforce and did not offer any benefits until the ACA became law, then they offered a Obamacare-acceptable plan at a fairly high cost. The plan had high copayments and deductibles. It also took me almost two years to be hired on. Now Toyota manages their own variable workforce and new hires are considered ""track"" team members. They will also be going to overnight or the new afternoon shift that starts next year even if they are placed on day shift to start, but that should be expected for any entry-level factory position.

The variable workforce is also vulnerable to short term layoffs. During the COVID shutdown in 2020 the full time employees were paid 80% while the variable workforce was laid off and expected to apply for unemployment. With the labor market what it is now and planned expansions at the plant I wouldn't consider it much of a threat.

If you're young and single you can start at Toyota, get married, have kids, send them to the on-site daycare, have plenty of PTO for family obligations and live comfortably. If you already have those obligations and need to provide insurance for an entire family and take time off regularly for family obligations you'd be better off looking at Alcoa or AstaZenaca. It may even be worth it to just stay in town and work at a place with a similar starting wage even if the top wages are lower by the time you consider cost of benefits and the commute.",t2_6prvq,BusyBeinBorn,0,1648657051.0,0,t1_i2qc4te,i2qc4te,True,fater1014,t3_ts4zzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/ts4zzf/anybody_have_any_insider_information_on_toyota/,Anybody have any insider information on Toyota and whether it’s worth working there?,/r/evansville/comments/ts4zzf/anybody_have_any_insider_information_on_toyota/i2qc4te/,16,r/evansville,0,16

Van Bibber just off of Weinbach? It's actually not too bad, I'd live there.

It sounds weird because they're literally a block or two apart but that's kind of how Evansville is lol. My husband is a mail carrier and he delivers a couple blocks north of this part of Van Bibber and he's delivered there before. I just asked him, he said he would live there and he's pretty picky about where we live.

My half-sister's great-grandma lives over there too, I've been to her house a couple times and from what I remember, the area is nice. It's not fancy but there are lots of well-kept yards, people clearly take pride in their modest homes. I think most of the people who live there have lived there a long time which does make a difference in the safety of the neighborhood. People look out for each other, they're just the right level of nosy haha.

My advice is to drive through the area yourself and see if you feel uncomfortable. Drive by at night, especially on the weekend. Trust your gut.

People will talk about how cheap the real estate is but never really stop to think about why it's so cheap.  The brain drain from here is bad.

People talk about how it's a nice mixture of small town and big city.  In my experience, you get a lot of the attitudes that come from big cities without many of the amenities.  Ypu get a lot of the crime without the variety you find in bigger cities.  You close mindedness of small towns and the headache of driving in pretty bad traffic.

"**$10,000 worth of lunches**  
But his office's generosity toward victims didn't extend to food — at least not compared to the food Hermann and his staff ate.  
  
Newman's county card paid $101 for two dozen ""gourmet drizzled strawberries"" sent four days before Christmas 2019. Ordered on a Friday, they were delivered to her home that Saturday with a card saying ""Merry Christmas!""  
  
Newman said the strawberries were for ""some kind of community outreach meeting in the office on a Monday.""  
  
""The place I ordered from did not recognize our work address, so I just had them sent to my house, and then I brought them in on Monday,"" she said.  
  
""We have all kinds of things that we order food and stuff for.""  
  
Prosecutor's office credit cards paid nearly $6,900 for 21 catered lunches from Panera Bread in 2020 and 2021, with several receipts stating the food was intended for 20 people. Newman said these were continuing education sessions for attorneys.  
  
Between them, Hermann and Newman spent an additional $2,931 on 12 meals at The Rooftop restaurant in Evansville in 2020 and 2021.  
  
Most of the Rooftop meal receipts came with no explanation, but Hermann referred to one in official correspondence as an ""attorney luncheon."" Another Rooftop receipt came with the words ""CLE (Continuing Legal Education) luncheon.""  
  
Other restaurants and eateries handled the prosecutor's office's credit cards. Two bills at McAlister's Deli each tallied more than $300. Nine charges at Papa John's added up to $1,200. A receipt for a Lamasco Bar and Grill to-go order for 10 pizzas came to $293 with tip.  
  
When the office bought food for crime victims and witnesses, on the other hand, the spending was mostly in the single digits.  
  
One March 2020 receipt gives as its purpose ""lunch for a victim here for a deposition."" The victim got an order of McNuggets at McDonald's for $8.20, paid with Newman's card. Five days later, Hermann's credit card would pay for a $590 catered lunch at The Rooftop.  
  
""Lunch purchased for witness in State v. Bengert murder trial,"" says another receipt's handwritten explanation. It was a quarter-pound grillburger-cheese combo with a large Blizzard at Dairy Queen. The tab: $9.16.  
  
""Dinner for a victim being interviewed at Holly's House"" came to $9.66 — the cost of fries, double cheeseburger and a large Pepsi at GD Ritzy's.   
  
One receipt was simply marked ""victim food."" It was a Filet-O-Fish with Coke at McDonald's, no tartar sauce. It was $6.69.  
  
**The victim lounge**  
Strawberries or strawberry-flavored food popped up again and again in credit card receipts filed by Hermann's office — at least 15 times in 2020 and 2021 — and not always with an explanation.  
  
When there was an explanation, receipts typically stated sliced strawberries were being purchased for the ""victim lounge"" — a room where crime victims and their families can meet during trials and trial preparation. Two receipts citing the ""victim break room"" and one stating ""victim asst."" included the purchase of ice cream, also using Newman's card.  
  
But Robyn Mastison, director of victim assistance at the prosecutor's office, told the Courier & Press that the victim lounge hasn’t offered sliced strawberries or ice cream or any other food that would require refrigeration or a freezer in the 12 years she has been in that position.  
  
Many other curious items were listed on receipts identified as being for the victim room, including a bottle of Hershey's Syrup, acid-reducing omeprazole tabs, a special edition of People magazine, maraschino cherries, 54 Reese's peanut butter cream Easter eggs, kosher salt, chunky applesauce, chicken salad and chocolate pudding. Newman's credit card was used for those.  
  
Acid reducer? Easter eggs? Newman said those were ""for the office.""  
  
The prosecutor's office has a break room of its own and a grand jury room where meetings sometimes are held, she said. Crime victims and grand jury members are sometimes around.  
  
What about all those strawberries?  
  
""It wasn’t that (un)common to have like a fruit tray or, especially if they had a breakfast meeting or something like that, to have snacks in there,"" Newman said. ""We always did that for the staff.""  
  
The strawberry purchases stopped in late January 2021, 10 weeks before Newman left the prosecutor's office.  
  
**County auditor's judgment call**  
Brian Gerth, who became county auditor in 2015, told the Courier & Press he would prefer the prosecutor's office and other agencies not have credit cards. There's too much potential for problems to arise.  
  
But Gerth, a Republican who is up for re-election in November, knows it's his job as the financial bookkeeper for county government to vet credit card claims and see that they are itemized.  
  
Hundreds of millions of dollars go through the books in his office, Gerth said. He doesn't personally see every transaction.  
  
""My claims people, you kind of get used to seeing some of the same stuff you get when you see (the prosecutor's office's) stuff monthly,"" he said. ""You know what it is.  
  
""Could the documentation be better? Sure. I really expect that, but this credit card statement is – I mean, it is a pain, everything that’s on there.""  
  
Questionable credit card claims put his office in a uncomfortable position, Gerth said. When the card has been used, the transaction has already happened.  
  
""At some point, are you going to let it go unpaid?"" he said. ""Well, if you let it go unpaid, now the credit card’s going to accrue penalties or interest or both. Well, we don’t want that to happen. So you kind of got to make some kind of judgment call.""",t2_88uox,TonySPhillips,0,1647466000.0,0,t1_i0xqj7z,i0xqj7z,False,IUErBear,t3_tfiql1,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/tfiql1/oh_nick_hermann/,"Oh, Nick Hermann...",/r/evansville/comments/tfiql1/oh_nick_hermann/i0xqj7z/,3,r/evansville,0,3

"# Prosecutor's office credit cards paid for bra, gourmet strawberries, $10K in staff lunches

EVANSVILLE, Ind. — The words ""nude"" and ""38DDD"" jump out in a stack of official credit card receipts filed by the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's Office in 2020 and 2021.  
  
A visit to Eastland Mall confirmed what cash register shorthand seemed to suggest: Items purchased with a county credit card at a women's store called Torrid included a ""push-up T-shirt"" bra, ""goddess foxy tank,"" jewelry and other items.  
  
The $262 bill was among thousands of dollars in questionable purchases the Courier & Press found in a two-year analysis of credit card spending in Prosecutor Nick Hermann's office. Charges ranged from the gourmet — a hundred-dollar order of drizzled strawberries — to mundane items such as a back scratcher and corn remover.  
  
Prosecutor Nick Hermann announces that he is running for re-election in the Prosecutor’s Office at the Evansville Civic Center Complex in Evansville, Wednesday afternoon, Feb. 2, 2022.  
All charges were made on two credit cards issued to the prosecutor's office, many with no explanation. All were paid by the county auditor's office.  
  
**'I’d be pretty outraged'**  
Julia Vaughn, policy director at Indiana Common Cause, said Vanderburgh County residents are entitled to wonder about such spending.  
  
""If I was a citizen of the community, I think I’d be pretty outraged and would be demanding a process that passes the smell test — a real accounting of what these expenditures were for and some sort of justification as to how they are related and a legitimate expense for this public official to make,"" said Vaughn, whose nonpartisan organization promotes government accountability.  
  
Hermann, the county's top law enforcement officer, is paid $164,950 a year to run an office that employs some 70 people. First elected in 2010, he will face voters in a May 3 Republican primary election against challenger Diana Moers, an Evansville-based section chief in the Indiana Attorney General's Office.   
  
  
The office prosecutes local felony and misdemeanor criminal cases, conducts investigations, supervises grand jury proceedings, enforces child support orders, handles juvenile prosecutions and assists crime victims.  
  
What is the prosecutor's office allowed to spend money on? That depends what pot it comes from. It has a county general fund budget of $2.6 million and receives at least half again as much money from grants, user fees and forfeitures.  
  
  
Following a state audit of Vanderburgh County government for 2014 and 2015 that found some county credit card transactions didn't have itemized receipts or ""adequately"" itemized receipts and that others went against the county's usage policy, the county commissioners adopted a credit card use policy specifically for the prosecutor's office.  
  
The resulting ordinance cites travel, training, legal research, equipment and expenses related to criminal investigation and prosecution as permissible uses of the prosecutor's credit card. It gets vague after that.  
  
""Any activity or program that is intended to reduce or prevent criminal activity (is permitted),"" the policy states. It also names ""ancillary expenses required for the administration of the office.""  
  
**'Not taxpayer dollars'**  
The credit card used at Torrid was assigned to Regene Newman, who was finance director for the prosecutor's office until last April. The receipt lists her as the customer.  
  
In an interview with the Courier & Press, Newman didn't dispute that she made the Torrid purchases but said the money came from user fees. The user fees are fines paid for infractions committed in Vanderburgh County, such as driving over the speed limit.  
  
To her, that makes all the difference.  
  
""What you need to understand is, none of that is paid with tax dollars,"" Newman said. ""That’s really important. You need to know that. It’s not out of taxpayer dollars or general fund money.""  
  
**Torrid Receipt**  
Infractions money is still public money, Vaughn said.  
  
""They may not have come out of the tax coffers, but they were collected by the government,"" Vaughn said.  
  
The Torrid credit card receipt is one among many for about $4,900 in gifts Hermann's office purchased in 2020 for ""Christmas angels."" Included with the receipts from Amazon, Old Navy and other stores were the wish lists of 10 children and teens, which included items such as clothes, a superhero bed set and a Baby Alive doll.  
  
Newman, who now works as a business director in Vanderburgh County Superior Court, conceded the Torrid purchases ""may not have been for the Christmas angels.""  
  
""That could have been for — you know, it’s been two years. I don’t know. We donate a lot of things to a lot of different companies,"" she said.  
  
Newman began in the prosecutor's office as a receptionist in the 1990s under then-Prosecutor Stan Levco, rising to become director of finance a few months later. She does not have a college degree, she said in her deposition in Hermann's settled sexual harassment lawsuit.   
  
She said the majority of examined credit card receipts were in her name because ""a lot of people"" used her card.  
  
""I’m the only one that had it in the office, that people could grab or use,"" Newman said. ""Nick carried his.""  
  
**Nick Hermann's credit card**  
The spending on Hermann's card included, among other equipment purchases, a karaoke portable PA speaker system for $267 on May 26, 2020.   
  
Hermann did not return a message about the karaoke PA system or his office's other credit card use. The karaoke receipt came with no explanation, but Newman said she thinks the equipment was meant for a large conference room and grand jury room built in 2016.  
  
On another occasion, Hermann spent $139 at Variety Village 2, a produce and plant store. The receipt simply says ""PRODUCE F.""  
  
Hermann's office also used a county credit card for floral arrangements costing $137, $135 and $62 in 2020 and 2021.  
  
It's not uncommon for politicians to send flowers as a show of sympathy or congratulations. Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke, for instance, has done so — but he paid for them out of his campaign fund, not government accounts.  
  
Youth and charitable causes have benefited from Hermann's credit card spending of public money on occasion.  
  
The prosecutor's office paid about $1,000 for 100 customized coloring books with saddle stitching. There's also a $250 donation to the 2020 Youth First Champions Celebration and money for pizza and makeup for kids' events. The office spent $1,853 from grant funds in October for books for students.  
  
Nearly $1,000 went to fundraisers for Deputy Jason Cutrell, who collapsed while on duty and was diagnosed with metastatic lung and brain cancer.  
  
Newman said Hermann ""watches out for victims of crime and kids that are in need.""

"FYI, Brian Holtz is the fired park's department director who is currently under investigation for committing fraud with parks department funds.  According to a C&P [article](https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/local/2022/01/19/evansville-parks-department-investigation-recreation-brian-holtz/9091860002/) from January 19, 2022 there's been little released by the EPD regarding the status of the investigation or the findings of the  audit by the Indiana State Board of Accounts.

In June 2021, Winnecke appointed deputy mayor Steve Schaefer as interim director of the parks department with Holtz out.

So, I think the reason there's been no movement on this since the pandemic hit is because of disorganization within the Parks department.  That being said, if you're emailing Brian Holtz, your most likely emailing the wrong person and should start emailing Steve Schaefer.",t2_s5h844w,IUErBear,0,1647272495.0,0,t1_i0mmm7c,i0mmm7c,True,Mr_Gilmore_Jr,t3_td91gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/td91gk/can_we_spam_these_guys_until_they_start_hosting/,Can we spam these guys until they start hosting events again?,/r/evansville/comments/td91gk/can_we_spam_these_guys_until_they_start_hosting/i0mmm7c/,2,r/evansville,0,2

"It's about like any other town.  The Home Depot's, Walmarts, Targets, McDonald's are the same in Eville as they are in ATL, Nashville, Cincinnati, Tampa.  

Only thing is Eville has no traffic compared to those cities.  Personally Eville is the biggest city I ever want to live in anymore, you can be anywhere in town in 20 minutes.  I've lived in cities where it takes 45 minutes to get to the other side of the street.  No thanks - not anymore.

I think the hospitals in this area are pretty good.  

If you miss the big city Louisville, Nashville a couple hours away.  3 hours to get to StL, Indianapolis, 4 to Cincinnati.  

Delta is in Eville so anytime you want to go back to AtL.

Evansville is flat corn land for most part - go 45 minutes east and you get into Hoosier National Forest and hills.

Evansville is probably one of the cheapest areas in the country to live, but real estate has been skyrocketing as in every other place.

It seems like a lot of the locals who were born here seem to have a negative attitude towards the place though.  This place sure beats the heck out of spending HOURS (plural) in traffic as some of the places those same people imagine to be a vibrant urban utopia metropolis.

"Evansville is a decent central location to bigger better cities.  2ish hours from Nashville, Louisville, and Saint Louis.  3 hours from Indianapolis and 4 hours from Cincinnati.  So going to concerts or large sporting events isn’t a major hassle.  We have 2 4-year universities, University of Evansville and University of Southern Indiana.  USI will be a Division I school starting this fall, so it’s possible some decent college basketball games will pop up from time to time.  We have an arena for concerts and a local minor league hockey team.

There’s a mall here that is just a standard mall on the small side.  Lots of restaurants, including some various ethnic varieties: Thai, Indian, Mediterranean, Japanese, Mexican, Vietnamese, etc.

If you take advantage of Uber or Lyft rides, we have that here too, but it’s nowhere near the scale of other cities.

We have a farmers market in the spring/summer, a historic courthouse, it’s on the Ohio River.

Occasionally we have air shows by the Blue Angels, we have the third largest street festival in the US — the West Side Nut Club Fall Festival, that runs for the first full week of October.

"I think it depends on what you like and what your views on life are. Things I agree with from above: definitely a conservative area, and racism does exist, though I'm sure it does everywhere; Centerpoint does make a killing; being  2-3 hours away from several major cities is a perk; Wesselmen Woods is nice, but our parks system is lacking otherwise. 

A few other notes... I personally think our school system is lacking and not very diverse. Our roads are terrible yet we pay a high tax on gas, to supposedly have nice ones. There isn't a whole to do and the focus lately is reviving downtown which I'm not sure is really working. Even our riverfront is lacking, especially when you compare ours to others that are a short drive away. Newburgh, for me isn't attractive because it's smaller, busy, full of subdivisions, and tends to be more uppity. East side is busy with a lot of shopping and eating, with the most diversity. Northeast and far north is growing to a lot more subdivisions and higher income. South side is what people would call the rough side of town. West side is its only little city, and the people don't like to go too far from it. Northwest is houses with more land and no subdivisions, quiet country with a short drive to North Park. I personally have always lived north and west. 

I'd say if your white, with conservative views, looking to raise active traveling sport kids, it's an ideal place.",t2_a4tmw8bd,Low-Plastic3454,0,1647004250.0,0,t1_i08id3b,i08id3b,True,sheezy520,t3_tbfro7,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/tbfro7/i_may_have_an_opportunity_to_move_to_evansville/,I may have an opportunity to move to Evansville for work.

"To support all of the overhead associated with these different places in the building it would take no cover charge to get into the building to generate enough foot traffic for a single day in the best-case scenario.  Adding $150-$200 monthly for the opportunity to just walk in the door as a starter will suffocate a restaurant (as an example) unless the prices are very high. 

We can look at either ECC or a club like Tri State Athletic to form some type of premium baseline this business bis looking at but TSA is struggling mightily and ECC's membership is aging out rapidly and the next generation in town  mostly has no interest in purchasing a social circle.

"I'm really not sure why you're so mad at me or why you're calling me names. I've not been mean to you. Are you okay? 

There actually *are* places called food pantries, maybe you haven't heard them called that before? 

https://eefpc.org/in-need/ 

I have been to them many times before because I grew up in poverty. I would have gladly taken food out of one of these little neighborhood pantries when I was a child because it would have kept me from going to bed hungry. The food orders you can get once a month do not last very long. There are independent food pantries in Evansville but I don't think there were nearly this many when I was a kid. I'm glad that more exist now. 

The way it worked when my family got food orders was that you went to the health department with the social security card of every person who lives in your home. Anyone who didn't have a social security card for whatever reason (lost, stolen, etc.) doesn't get counted for the amount of food they give you. You get approved through the health department and they give you a little paper to give the food pantry and list of pantries you can go to. The process may have changed since then but the website listed above says that referrals are given every 30 days so I don't think it's changed all that much. 

I actually haven't been able to volunteer at a food pantry before but I do donate money to Tri-State Food Bank (since they can do much more with cash than they can with in-kind donations). 

Again, I don't know why you're being so negative. Sure, the boxes are open to the elements but most of what was pictured here was something that could easily sit in a hot location for days and still be safe to eat. And to be fair, you don't really know where the canned food donations you get from a food pantry came from. Someone could have left the food in the trunk of their car for a month before donating it and you'd be none the wiser.",t2_b05uc,jersharocks,0,1646710212.0,0,t1_hzsl39f,hzsl39f,False,Joshdriskell1,t3_t6lrgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/t6lrgm/look_at_how_our_neighbors_care_for_each_other/,Look at how our neighbors care for each other!!!

"Thanks friend. It is not my little library. It is my neighbors. It is also at least four-five other ones 

If you want to donate books you can, the little libraries are on Spring and Walnut, Alvord and Mulberry, Mulberry and Frederick, and a few more in the area. 

These are around U of E but someone messaged me and said the ones farther out on the east side have also been hit. 

I know times are tough right now but being a bad person isn’t the answer. As I stated the one by house is run by kids, kids built it, and maintain it. It’s a pretty shitty thing to do.

"The ""best"" restaurants in Evansville....you need to travel more. Every restaurant here uses the same 5 ingredients. It's literally the shittiest diversity of food. I know we have more than say Henderson, but we just have more shitty, bland restaurants masquerading themselves as special, while they are just the new fad that week/month. Then they close within a year and the cycle starts all over again.

TLDR: Mind your own shit and don't stress about ball caps in Chick-Fil-A.

ALSO, why complain about ball caps when Evansville has the 7th worst air quality in the nation (ahead of Chicago and New York City), we have the highest population of obese people (coronary valley) and the ugliest Hooters in the nation (not sure if it still is voted that, but was some years ago).

"I rarely watch 44, so I can barely say for sure in general, but I will say that 44 totally botched their coverage of implosion of the 420 Main building. Behind-the-desk reporter missed the countdown despite the on-site person trying to warn him and then talked over the explosions he was trying to explain. They squeezed the mayor’s interview in hastily. It felt extremely unprofessional, especially in the moment. I’ve studied the coverage of the implosion from 44, Eyewitness 25, and 14, and 14 by far had the best coverage, especially because they waited and had their mayoral interview after the implosion, when there was no time constraint. 44’s was the worst. Eyewitness’s audio was peaked and sounded somewhat redlined during the explosions. 14’s coverage was very professional overall.",t2_53zputqv,ayedunno013,0,1645672736.0,0,t1_hy6w8go,hy6w8go,True,Just_Communication32,t3_szw39d,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/szw39d/44_news/,44 News,/r/evansville/comments/szw39d/44_news/hy6w8go/,6,r/evansville,0,6

Per CP:  CenterPoint Energy utilities are not allowed to markup, nor profit, from  
 the purchase and sale of natural gas. Only gas costs actually incurred   
and approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission are recovered   
from customers. Natural gas is a commodity bought and sold in a national  
 deregulated market and prices fluctuate daily due to supply and demand   
pressures. CenterPoint Energy purchases natural gas on behalf of its   
customers and then passes those costs on to customers through the gas   
cost adjustment, which is listed on the bill as “Gas Cost Charge.”",t2_10ioyw,mlotto7,0,1645022003.0,0,t1_hx6d3nt,hx6d3nt,False,DocShards,t3_stjyhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/stjyhn/if_youre_mad_about_centerpoint_prices_andon/,"If you're mad about CenterPoint prices andon Facebook, you may be interested in this group",/r/evansville/comments/stjyhn/if_youre_mad_about_centerpoint_prices_andon/hx6d3nt/,-7,r/evansville,0,-7

My bill for my apartment was higher than some of my friends who have houses, and we're pretty careful with our energy consumption.

For folks who have gas, many were expecting higher bills because of increased gas prices, but there's also the problem of fee hikes, which for many are outpacing the gas price increases and more expensive than their actual gas use.

Sharing personal stories is a powerful tool for instilling change and many people have been struggling with energy costs for a long time in this area.

"Everyone needs to educate themselves on how regulated utilities make money. 

Part of your bill is a straight pass through of fuel costs. There is no mark up. NAT gas is October was five times more expensive than the previous June. CNP can’t help that and we look uninformed if we blame that on them. But that is not the only place where costs are rising and they will hide behind the increased fuel costs if you don’t call them out. 

They also make money on delivery charges and return on capital requested in rate cases and those are entirely within their control. If inflation raises the price of anything they claim they need to increase fees. But if they lay off staff or negotiate better contracts they don’t have to lower fees and pass those savings on. 

They also ask regulators to let them charge fees that guarantee a rate of return on assets like pipes and substations. This is understandable as businesses need to make money. But while you and I make less than 1% on our saved assets, CNP requests 9 to 10% and regulators grant it. Go after PUC officials and ask them to justify why we should be charged to guarantee such a high rate of return for a privately held company.

"The example I've heard from teachers is that if a student comes to them and tells them something that is happening at home, the teacher cannot engage in conversation.   I'm assuming they'll be instructed to read a script.  The exception to this is if the parent authorizes the teacher to speak with the student on these issues.   So if a kid comes to a teacher and says his Father is drinking all day and verbally abusing them, they would have to get permission from said Father to actually talk about it.  Think that will happen?

My wife's a teacher.   They are all burnt out.   It's a hard enough job and they don't get compensated enough for it.   A few years ago I tracked her hours to figure out her pay and it was less than $4/hr with the amount of time she puts in.

"I'm opposed to it.

* Point 4 is too vague. What classes or lessons can students opt out of? All of them? Some of them? A certain number per school year? Will all subjects be included or just certain ones (probably Literature, History, sex ed)? Where will students go if they opt out of lessons? Who is supervising them during this time? Etc

* The point about a committee that includes lay people is concerning. Why would untrained professionals get say in creating curriculum? This does not happen in most other jobs.

* 9 doesn't make much sense. An assignment can't ""reveal"" their attitude, habits, etc?...so, we're just not teaching the personal essay anymore? We're not doing food and exercise diaries in health class? We're not doing reflection and analysis in lit class? We're not letting teachers know our learning styles? Part of learning is learning about yourself!

* Point 11 will result in dead kids. Kids need a **safe** outlet to discuss issues and notification to parents beforehand is not a safe outlet. A kid wants to confide about abuse? Sexuality? Gender identity? Pregnancy? Shady stuff mom and dad are getting up too? They now have to wait for parents to okay. And not all parents are going to. And kids aren't going to talk and they're going to continue to try to carry those burdens and it won't end well. Teachers and other school staff should be seen as safe people to turn to, no matter what.

* Point 12--what are they changing sexually explicit *to*? What exactly is dissemination to minors? Assigning it in class? Having it on shelves? For libraries, which also serve adults, this is particularly tricky. How can they provide materials for adults while not providing it to minors? Create old school ""adult rooms"" with the curtain in the door and the sense of seediness and shame?

* Posting curriculum on the site might be okay, if it was flexible and clear that things change. Teachers alter lesson plans all the time. Sometimes students struggle to grasp a concept so they spend more time on it than planned. Sometimes the topic creates vibrant discussions so they stay on it longer. Sometimes they realize another book is going to work better with this set of kids, so they read something else. Sometimes it is a nice day so they go outside to identify plants vs sitting inside talking about theories...and also. This isn't much of an argument, I'll admit. But I'm generally weirded out by how much parents ""need"" to know about their kids days. Like. Teachers are constantly emailing, they're posting on different apps, they're posting on private Facebook pages throughout the day. Parents can log on and check each child's grades (not just overall class grades, but individual assignments). They know everything their kids have done all day, without needing to ask the kids at all. Is this healthy? Normal? Should a parent know in August exactly what their child is going to learn in January? I think it would be much better and healthier to step back. Let the kids have some breathing room and then ask about their day at dinner or on the drive to soccer practice or whatever.

"I cannot even begin to explain how disastrous this bill is.  Anyone who has any kind objection to their child learning something already has multiple avenues to make sure that they get exactly what they want, regardless of how fringe or marginal their opinions are.  The obvious example is homeschooling, but if the family would prefer an online class option, there are many different curricula ranging from reasonably mainstream to terrifying strange.

Additionally, anyone can appeal to the state department of education and voice concerns about curricula.

These are all tools individuals already have, with no requirement to be invested in any ""sincerely held belief"".  This bill expressly makes it easy for anyone to warp or dilute education for an entire class -- or, more likely, an entire school corporation.  It is dangerous and unjustifiable.",t2_eowfmcue,Dances_With_Turtles,0,1644890240.0,0,t1_hwzdtob,hwzdtob,True,MrPeteO,t3_ssowj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/ssowj3/indiana_hb_1134/,Indiana HB 1134,/r/evansville/comments/ssowj3/indiana_hb_1134/hwzdtob/,14,r/evansville,0,14

"Couple of thoughts on this:

1) teachers are over worked as it is. Having to create alternative assignments, tracking opt outs, etc. is just leading to even less prep time on the rest of the curriculum. Burning out teachers or reducing quality. 

2) Schools are supposed to be a controlled space for kids to be challenged with new information and perspectives that don’t align with their existing world view. Just because they are exposed to another perspective doesn’t mean they are being indoctrinated. 

3) Parents are not qualified educators. How many other professions allow a group of lay people to second guess the professional’s best judgement based on their years of formal training?

4) this could lead to large swings in what is taught from year to year based on what is deemed objectionable to the committee and parents at that time. Lots of work planning a class every year and potential uneven knowledge base entering college based on what was in and out of curriculum during that class’s matriculation. 

5) the tracking and consent clauses are probably covered by other laws and policies if not as explicitly stated 

This seems like an idea to address a current hot button issue, but the long term ramifications have not been thought through. Every generation has some topics or materials that parents object to. But reading catcher in the rye didn’t turn an entire generation into misanthropes. I know why the caged bird sing didn’t scar me for life or introduce me to adult material I wasn’t already seeing on TV or the internet. 

Trust your kids. You will probably be surprised how quickly they reject bad ideas and concepts even if they can’t fully articulate why. I could teach a group of teens communism is great every day for years and it wouldn’t convince them to give up individual earning power, the choices of a free market economy, and join a collective. Even most of those that ran away to join hippie communes in the sixties eventually realized that being an adult, working a job, and having a family was a legit life choice.

"Disclaimer, I’m not well versed with this kind of stuff. I have a couple of issues with how this is worded. 
The title of the bill is “Education matters” but it seems to me this is acting to prevent students from learning (part 4). It’s very vague about what people can opt in or out of. What meets the requirements for being able to opt out of something? Just the committee? Or what determines whether something affects someone’s beliefs(part 9)? I feel like these can be abused. 

I do like the idea of making curriculum easier to find for each school (part 2). Any mental health support is always awesome. I didn’t know part 8 was a problem haha. 

On paper it seems like it could be good to shake up the curriculum. It does seem a little outdated and   would like more specific routes going through high school. So having committees make suggestions for things to be added to the curriculum seems good. 

A part of me feels this was made to address people that are scared of critical race theory. I believe it will divide people that can’t agree what we should be learning in schools. It’s a hot button issue and I don’t know what we should be teaching in schools. It’s tough.",t2_164ual,Huey421,0,1644886514.0,0,t1_hwz642c,hwz642c,True,MrPeteO,t3_ssowj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/ssowj3/indiana_hb_1134/,Indiana HB 1134,/r/evansville/comments/ssowj3/indiana_hb_1134/hwz642c/,3,r/evansville,0,3

"People really need to educate themselves on the purpose of the EARN IT Act  and what it entails before they spread sensationalism generated by the media and by uninformed citizens who haven’t taken the time nor effort to understand the content of what has garnered their oppositional stance.

While this isn’t great, it’s not the privacy-removing measure that will allow the government to spy on people implicitly in the manner it’s being perceived by the people who are vehemently against its introduction into law. 

Besides, the government has been able to, and has utilized its access to our communications for years, without fear of retribution. It’s the government; they do what they want in this “free” country of ours. And the bill was being discussed before the pandemic began, apropos of nothing.

">I’m also an alumnus, and I haven’t heard anyone that I have spoken to recently about it in the community (fellow alumni, former student athletes, current students, current professors) like this move.

I've generally had the opposite experience, though to be fair, most of my exposure to this is via Facebook friends and LinkedIn groups. 

>The softball and men’s basketball championship runs were awesome a few years ago, but we won’t get back there for decades, if ever now. 

The 2019 run was special, but remember, for all this talk about how strong USI's program is, they've only been to the Elite 8 four times. I remember being on campus in 04 when we upset Metropolitan State to get to the National Championship game. We had a watch party in.....I forget which lecture hall, but people were celebrating after like we won the national title. It was awesome. Now imagine USI winning a conference tournament to get to the NCAA Tournament. I think you'd get a similar on campus reaction for something that might only happen once every few years.


>I’d rather attend games that have a chance to end in a win and eventual championship than be a D1 doormat/dumpster fire. Idk why everyone is so negative about D2.

We don't know if USI is going to be a doormat. If USI is even an occasional NCAA Tournament team, that's a win for me. The OVC is one of the conferences rumored to be interested in USI. Look at the teams in the OVC that are not leaving. Who scares you in that league? USI is in the middle of the pack enrollment wise, and an endowment that dwarfs a lot of the schools. There's no reason to think USI couldn't compete in a league like that.


>I kept seeing things like “wow it’ll be so nice to go to more games now.” What was stopping you before? 

I don't live in Evansville anymore, but I go to every USI game when they're in Indy. We used to have alumni events at these games. I think in general, every sports team could benefit from more community support. I know folks that don't go to Otters games because ""it isn't MLB so it's pointless"". I hope USI schedules games at IUPUI, it'll be nice to continue the Indy Alumni events. 

As an aside, every USI Alumni event I attended, the University president attended. The number one quest asked of the president, every time, was when are we going to Division 1? I think for the alumni, there's long been an appetite to see the school continue to grow.",t2_rrq9z,otterbelle,0,1644348348.0,0,t1_hw4dzea,hw4dzea,False,The_Smoothie,t3_smy82m,https://www.reddit.com/r/evansville/comments/smy82m/university_of_southern_indiana_moving_to_ncaa/,University of Southern Indiana moving to NCAA Division I sports,/r/evansville/comments/smy82m/university_of_southern_indiana_moving_to_ncaa/hw4dzea/,-2,r/evansville,0,-2

"I’m also an alumnus, and I haven’t heard anyone that I have spoken to recently about it in the community (fellow alumni, former student athletes, current students, current professors) like this move. Most conversations that I heard around campus when I was still there were along the lines of “it’s a bad idea but the trustees are going to do it anyway once Dr. Bennett retires😬😅” The athletic budget is going to have to at least double. D1 entry fees are over $1.5mil. We are splitting community/corporate donations in an already small market with UE. Student fees are going to go up. There are already so many things (dealing with academics and student experience) around campus that need financial attention. The softball and men’s basketball championship runs were awesome a few years ago, but we won’t get back there for decades, if ever, now. 

It’s like the university got the survey results back and then completely ignored that the majority of the community was not for making the move to DI. It’s just rubbing the students the wrong way. Why ask for their opinion if it doesn’t even matter, you know?

I’d rather attend games that have a chance to end in a win and eventual championship than be a D1 doormat/dumpster fire. Idk why everyone is so negative about D2. I kept seeing things like “wow it’ll be so nice to go to more games now.” What was stopping you before?

Even the Crossroads Classic (RIP) was great because of how close Purdue, IU, ND, and Butler are to one another. 

Let's make this happen. If you are upset that the Aces pretty much never have something to cheer for, this gives them a big game every year that matters even if the MVC is way out of reach. And this gives USI an instant boost in what could otherwise be a rocky transition. Both teams get to hype it up every year, it would draw in big crowds, and even if the game was sloppy it gives our city a cool talking point that ultimately makes us all look good.

"President Biden certainly doesn't have control over the lax regulations in Texas that let energy companies run wild. He doesn't run the Exxon refinery in Houston that's had two major explosions in the last year, forcing the refinery to shut down which makes gas prices rise. He had no control over Centerpoint not weatherizing their facilities in Texas which led to over 700 people dying in Texas and our Centerpoint bills rising because Gov. Abbott is allowing them to add a surcharge to all bills to recoup the billions they lost last year. Biden also has no control over rising demand for enegy as the world recovers from the pandemic. 

Sadly, the narrative that the USA was energy independent is not true. We did sell more energy than we consumed, making us a net energy exporter, but we still needed to import certain products, like the LT crude used for gasoline from other countries. It's also a false narrative that denying the permit for the Keystone pipeline made the USA energy dependent again. The Keystone pipeline was designed to transport dirty Canadian tar sands oil straight to the Gulf for export to China. The company refused to guarantee any of the refined products would remain in the USA.
