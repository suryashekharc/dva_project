"To work on your parking skills, I highly recommend you get some traffic cones and set up your own practice area, EXACTLY as it shows in the guide.

The tester will test this in this order, with cones set up.  The biggest thing with the parking is to do your best on the first shot, but don't shift forward and back to make it perfect.  Each time you shift, it's a point. Hitting a cone is a point. I think you max out at six points in the parking test.

"Surely, 20% is still the standard for good service for all service workers. This is not always the case and we understand that. On a lower side, tip the price of a gallon of gas to $4. Anything above $50 bucks should be above $5 up to 20%. I get standard $5 tips from a bunch of customers even on $15 orders, which is why we understand not everyone would do 20%. There is some leeway there.

Things to consider when tipping, weather, distance from the store, politeness of the driver, getting the correct sauces and drinks (mostly the driver's responsibility to remember sides), and time it took from ordering until it gets there (a busy night should yield no longer than an hour and a half for most pizza places unless understaffed).

Things that don't matter, drivers, getting lost in unfamiliar areas (they might be new), the classic various trackers food places have these days malfunctioning (the software relies on apps the drivers download and they don't work on all phones), or the creation quality of the product (drivers almost NEVER make food and are not responsible for this, call the store and the managers will take care of you).

I've been doing food delivery for 17 years and I have done the math, if every customer tipped $4-5 the drivers would almost never complain. The stiffs add up over the course of the night and unless there are some big tippers, the driver might not make anything after gas costs.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should also note that 20% is easy to figure out mentally without a calculator.

anyway, there's s section of M-54 which is assigned to the old Dixie Highway that was rebuilt as a 3-lane with center turn.  Also, Dort Highway had some road diet too, because Dort Highway was an early pre-Interstate bypass route that was built with passing lanes as early as the 1950s.

I knew that some semi-rural roadways had 4-lanes in the 1950s prior to Interstates because I found an old 1950s road map of Michigan from Shell Oil which indicated which roadways were multi-lane, and well, Dixie Highway and Dort Highway both fit the bill in that era.",t2_wqwoj,SupremoZanne,0,1641175502.0,0,t1_hr0nfwr,hr0nfwr,False,SupremoZanne,t3_ru1ezs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Saginaw/comments/ru1ezs/a_section_of_dixie_highway_between_birch_run_and/,"A section of Dixie Highway between Birch Run and Saginaw, it had four lanes as early as the 1950s before the I-75 freeway came along, it used to be part of US-23 and US-10, you can see it has really bad pavement as of January 1, 2022",/r/Saginaw/comments/ru1ezs/a_section_of_dixie_highway_between_birch_run_and/hr0nfwr/,1,r/Saginaw,0,1

Sometimes crime rates are more of a perception than reality; cities with working people to middle class incomes are often pegged as ""crime-ridden,"" while suburbs and rural areas are considered ""safe."" People are people, no matter where they live, and crime can be manifest as embezzling, murder, rape, animal cruelty, speeding, or a recent high school shooting in a small town.

"Don't know if you are still reading this thread, but I've been bogged down by my semester duties at Saginaw Valley State University, and am now taking time out to do some ""me"" reading.

Briefly read through the posts and responses, so I'll offer my 2 cents.

I moved to the area in 2005, for a position as assistant professor at SVSU. I started with an apartment in Saginaw Township, because I wanted to learn the area, and that was one of few apartment complexes where I could keep 2 cats.

After a year, I moved to a home in Carrollton Township, next door to the City. I moved there because, frankly, it was five minutes to work. Translation - I could get home in five minutes. I enjoyed my time in Carrollton Township, but over the years I realized I was paying for a house that I was not fully utilizing (basement!), and decided to downsize. The VA mortgage was about $700 for a two-bedroom, 1,300 sq ft home.

I knew I wanted to live in the City, so I started looking for homes with about 1,000 sq ft, with no basement. I now live in Fordney Park area, and pay $370 VA mortgage for a two-bedroom home. My drive to campus is now about 15 minutes, but I'm a full professor and don't mind the short commute - when I lived in Tennessee I could always count on a 30- to 45-minute commute.

While the majority of the commenters recommended moving to an outside township or different part of the state, I've always enjoyed city life, whether it was in California (Monterey & Oakland/Berkeley), Ohio (Toledo), Tennessee (Nashville & Chattanooga), or Michigan (Detroit & Saginaw). And yes, the quality of life is still interesting for a city of 48,000, which is down from its peak population in 1990 of 69,000. But it is always challenging to look through rose-colored glasses at ""how it used to be."" Memories, assumptions, and ""what I've heard"" tend to distort the reality.

I've learned to enjoy where I am - and if I don't, then I move, change, or do something different. I'm glad I moved to the City - wish I hadn't waited almost 15 years to do so.",t2_hr7dv8pj,KatzMa_9Lives,0,1640017802.0,0,t1_hpb6kh2,hpb6kh2,True,shartnadooo,t3_qovz3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Saginaw/comments/qovz3h/looking_at_moving_to_saginaw/,Looking at Moving to Saginaw,/r/Saginaw/comments/qovz3h/looking_at_moving_to_saginaw/hpb6kh2/,2,r/Saginaw,0,2

"I don't think diversity will be an issue, as it relates to white/black/brown (mexican). You're not gonna find the type of diversity you may be used to in SoCal (I've spent a significant amount of time there), but it will be decent enough.

The homes that, IMHO seem to be in better shape are mostly the single level ranch style brick homes, and those tend to exist in the same neighborhoods.

" Avoid city of Saginaw stay in township of Saginaw and there’s also Zilwaukee and Kochville Township. All three are near businesses and the mall and things like that.

If you want to be near the airport Freeland is where you want to be and that’s near Saginaw as well. It’s actually right between Saginaw and Midland. Midland has a lot of the same stores and businesses you would find in Saginaw. Don’t limit yourself to just Saginaw.


 If you want to be near the beach maybe Bay City would be a little bit better.

Frankenmuth is another town outside of Saginaw that is mostly tourist attractioning family owned shops selling gifts and candy. It’s a very pedestrian friendly area. After 8 PM it’s kind of a ghost town everyone goes home and businesses are closed.

Don't limit yourself just to Saginaw though... if employment opportunities allow, Midland and Bay City are similar sized and the three cities basically connect at this point, along with Freeland in the middle.

"You should absolutely do a scouting trip...and more than one if you ask me (unless you plan on staying for at least a week).

You mention wanting to visit Detroit...South East Michigan is full of wonderful 'burbs' outside of the Metro Detroit area. They're all different and worth checking out. I'm currently living in the Cleveland area, and for comparison there's really only Toledo, Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. They all stand out by themselves and are distant from each other (nothing really in between or surrounding). Each of those cities around Detroit offer a unique opportunity and experience which you won't find in most other midwestern states. I didn't appreciate it until I left the state.

I think you'll find what you're looking for in the tri-city area. There are smaller towns that may tick your boxes, but you'll have to factor in the bias you'll probably encounter when you or someone mentions Saginaw...as Saginaw will get lumped into one big bucket by people who don't know the difference between the city/township and who have never stepped foot anywhere near there. My best friend and her husband was telling me about their experiences with their 7th grade son playing football (they live in the township mind you!) and how the parents/refs where stereotyping them because they lived/played for Saginaw (again, they live in the township and their son attends a nice school).

I applaud you for wanting to give back. I'll be moving back to the west coast by April of 2022, but I'm more than happy to help point you in the right direction or give you some contacts when it comes time for you to make a trip out there/here.

"Thank you so much!  I was wondering if some of the fear of crime was a little out of proportion to day to day living.  I'm probably just as likely to get my car broken into here.  We have a lot of meth here, and I know crime usually stems from poverty and desperation.  I'm really encouraged by some of the changes that are happening in Saginaw, because it takes so much to break the cycle of poverty and desperation in a world that benefits from keeping folks there.  I was feeling it myself until we decided we had to leave.  I'd like to live somewhere that's feeding that hope, and try to contribute.  We looked at Detroit because of that for a minute, but it's too big for me. Definitely worth being close to and visiting, though!

We are relatively limited in price, and are thinking heavily about the Tricities area.  It sounds like there's a lot to choose from in the area, though, and it's going to be worth making a trip out in the spring to explore and check out some houses.

"Ignore most of what the person you responded to said. They are correct when they say to avoid the CITY. Also, car insurance is expensive...but that's state wide and nothing to do with Saginaw (blame Detroit for that one). The water bills are not out of line expensive compared to other areas. I'll tell you how I know in a bit. Getting shot? As others have pointed out, the majority of the crime is targeted...and the violent crime is in the city, not the township. People leaving the state for jobs? That's not a Saginaw issue...that's the majority of the midwest. Young adults graduate college with skills/degrees that don't translate to jobs where they currently live...or they get job offers from out of state...and they leave. Same thing is happening in Ohio and other surrounding states. 

I spent half of my life living in Saginaw. I live out of state now. I've lived in the Midwest, the West Coast, back to the Midwest and soon back to the West Coast. I have family and friends in Saginaw, Flint, Grand Blanc, Lansing, Ann Arbor, etc. I don't go back as much as I used to, but I was just there last week. Because my trips are more like snapshots in time, the differences in between trips stand out to me more than someone who lives there and sees nothing but Saginaw every day.

Saginaw is divided by a river.. East side (City and one township) and West side (City and township further west). This division was/is also along poverty/racial lines as well. Black/Mexicans= East side/City. Whites=West side/Township. That's just how it always was. But back then, the east side/city didn't look like it does now. GM was THE major employer and decent paying jobs with benefits were available. Anyways...I won't get too deep into it but when GM left, the poverty blight crept in. People who could afford to, moved west across the river to better housing. Eventually, the blight slowly crept across the river too. 

Other commenters have hit the nail on the head as to what has happened since, and the attempted rebirth of at least the downtown area in the near east side of the river. There's also truth in the fact that there's a significant part of the white population that feeds into the ""you'll get car jacked and shot if you go across the river"" ..which is blatantly not true. The city has wonderful events/programs on the east side during the spring and summer. There is a significant amount of investment going into the downtown area (and others). Don't buy into the FUD.

I grew up in Saginaw, spent a lot of time back forth between both sides of the river and have more than a few high school friends and family still there. I've also spent a few decades living outside of the city and state. The other people who replied have pretty much nailed the advice. I'll just double down on:

* Don't buy a house in the city. Stick to the township or surrounding areas
* If diversity is important to you, stick to the township, or look at Bay City. Frankenmuth (smaller but lots of tourist traffic) or Birch Run (busy because of the outlet mall) might be options if you're wanting a more 'city' vibe. Once you leave the township, well, you can check the demographics yourself. As someone previously pointed out...self segregation.
* Consider the western part of the state. Extremely beautiful, especially in the Traverse City area. This is coming from someone who spent their whole Michigan existence trying to get to Detroit to party.
* Facebook groups are a good source of information
* [Delta](https://www.delta.edu/) is a great community college and [SVSU](https://www.svsu.edu/) is nearby and is also a great school. You can't go wrong with either.

"Glad to be of help. Basically anything outside of Saginaw City and Saginaw Township are going to be heavily rural. The towns I referenced are mostly one traffic light towns. The only one that's not is Birch Run. Frankenmuth is also a really nice area if a bit snooty. Heavily rural but also somewhat ""progressive"". They've got an organic/health food type store(they've got essential oils and all kinds of organic/keto/Paleo diet foods). Healthy Habits is what it's called. Saginaw has three. One is called Heritage Natural Foods another is Discount Health Foods then there's Greens and Grains. Saginaw for all it's short comings is more or less the big town out of the three considered to be the Tri Cities in the area(Midland and Bay City being the other two. Both worth a look as well). The main roads are usually well taken care of during the winter. Side roads and residential roads aren't usually plowed though. Otherwise it's a pretty normal area I'd say. There is the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge on the south end of Saginaw. Nice spot to go for a walk and check out the nature. Then there's the Tobico marsh in the Bay City area that's also part of the nearby state park. There's a lot more to see and learn about the area.",t2_3qnoagpc,GUNROAR62,0,1636338759.0,0,t1_hjr9beq,hjr9beq,False,shartnadooo,t3_qovz3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Saginaw/comments/qovz3h/looking_at_moving_to_saginaw/,Looking at Moving to Saginaw,/r/Saginaw/comments/qovz3h/looking_at_moving_to_saginaw/hjr9beq/,1,r/Saginaw,0,1

If you're looking to move to the area I might suggest looking further outside the city. The township is great. Thomas township is great. Hemlock is to the west and plenty quiet if that's what you like. Reese is to the east and much the same as Hemlock. Freeland is really nice but a bit more expensive. Freeland gets the overflow of well off folks from Dow in Midland. Birch Run to the south is nice if a bit busy with the large outlet mall. If you want to live in the city specifically I'd say living in the area that borders the township would be best. The Adams Boulevard area is nicer than most. You've also got the area around the Country Club that's nice. The city is getting better between investments from the local colleges(Delta College and Central Michigan have satellite campuses in or near the downtown area) as well as improvements being made around town between the new parks that have gone up and are being worked on to the new construction on both sides of the river.

If you have Facebook, I recommend following City of Saginaw Government, they do a great job highlighting community members making an impact and also events around the city. From what I can tell there is a lot of excitement around new businesses, improvements, etc. to downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods. The Saginaw Basin Land Conservancy is pretty active if you are into conservation. They work on a lot of projects all around the area. I also really liked the Hoyt public library when I lived there!

"We've been looking on realtor.com for the most part.  We're less interested in investment properties or gaining equity than we are having a place that we can live comfortably (like, dishwasher and a roof that doesn't leak, hah) and affordably.

I appreciate your input, and it does sound like the crime isn't quite as big of an impact on the average person.  I'm sure there are still some break-ins and robberies, but I know here it is a bit more random crime related to meth.  We're also on a trafficking corridor, so that's fun :(.  But even so, it doesn't impact our every day life, and we do lock our doors and vehicles and practice general common sense.

"I spent most of my life in the area so I'll take a stab at your post. I think the first thing to do is back up and look at the recent history of the city as that will illuminate a lot of what discussion/answers follow: 

Saginaw is - like most of the rust belt cities (there are many) - almost in a sort of 'fallen' status from an earlier economic golden age when the automotive industry was stronger and before the population self-segregated *[1]*. The population base, infrastructure, and commercial base that was pumped up on auto dollars are now in states of disrepair and decay. Only relatively recently have some of the more notable cities (such as Detroit) begun to recover from this. 

I don't however think Saginaw has much more decaying to do but what has occurred has left run down buildings/blocks/infrastructure everywhere and large numbers of people in poverty. What will happen next is anyone's guess, but prior to me leaving a few years ago there the outlook seemed hopeful for the future of the city. It is tenuously trying to incubate new businesses and industries in the City and regain a strong financial footing.

*[1] Note the large number of townships surrounding the city. If you're curious check the demographics of these townships against Saginaw and you'll see the self-segregation. Saginaw skews poor/black and many of the townships skew wealth(ier)/white.*  

With that out of the way, let's move onto your questions:

-

**How's community involvement?**

Many within the city are pushing for it's renewal/rebirth and there is a *general* push to incubate new businesses/programs as noted before. People around the area outside of the city tended to be pretty dismissive of it however.

-

**What sorts of jobs and wages are there?**

The largest industries in the city are Automotive (and related) and then healthcare by virtue of having the majority of the hospitals in the region (known as the tri-cities or Saginaw valley. Bay City and Midland are nearby with different industries). If you have a useful education or skillset towards one of those two industries there are pretty good opportunities be found relative to the cost of living. If not, most of Michigan is pushing into baseline wages around $15/hr so I would expect there to be many jobs around that wage rate that are also entry level. 

Do take some time to look at the available job postings. I highly suggest also looking into the major employers in the tri-cities. If you're thinking about working as a factory laborer I would recommend looking into trades or technician work. Those roles can have good boosts in pay with fairly small barriers to entry.

-

**I have heard the east side of town is a little sketchier, what does that mean exactly (break-ins, poor infrastructure)?**

The east side of town has fallen hardest. There are many rundown structures but a lot of the blight has been removed and there are now simply vacant lots where there were once houses and midrises. I personally stuck to the west side of the river and never ran into any issues with crime there. I recommend looking around on google maps. More on this topic in a later point.

-

**How is the water in town? It sounds like they're making progress in Flint, and that's its own thing, and lead pipes are really everywhere, but does Saginaw have any infrastructure issues like that to be aware of?**

The water is fine. Flint had their water source mismanaged, it's not as though all the water in MI contains lead or something. Do read up on these topics more if you're considering moving to the area. The biggest infrastructure concern is the road quality - they are pretty bad.

-

**I have read about high crime rates, etc., and some folks are saying that is improving. Are there precautions you feel you have to take to mitigate this or feel safe?**

Unless you are looking for trouble I wouldn't expect trouble to find you; follow basic precautions of living in a city (lock your doors, hide valuables in your car and keep it locked, etc.) and you are unlikely to have any issues. At the very least violent crime is generally related to personal vendettas or gangs/drugs. Much of this is probably driven by the poverty present - maybe not unlike how you describe your current area becoming.

-

**Mostly, I'm interested in how we can move there in a way that we can contribute to the community and not take over/take away from the locals.**

I can confidently say that you shouldn't worry about being a gentrifier in Saginaw. There are also plenty of community orgs to become involved with if you so desire. 

*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

With all that out of the way I really recommend trying to read up on the  area (maybe even MI as a whole) and thoroughly investigating available job postings. If you're able to visit for an extended period of time I would strike up conversation with as many people as possible (small business owners of cafes and the like might be easy targets) to get their feeling on the state of things. If you're honest about your situation and intentions I don't think you'll run into many issues.

Lastly: I mentioned that I used to live there - I did end up moving away to Metro Detroit for better financial opportunities. Yhat isn't to say there aren't opportunities in Saginaw and the surroundings but they are much weaker than the larger cities in MI. Given, cost of living is higher elsewhere as well.",t2_myh5f,Kasrkraw,0,1636319835.0,0,t1_hjq2qrb,hjq2qrb,True,shartnadooo,t3_qovz3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Saginaw/comments/qovz3h/looking_at_moving_to_saginaw/,Looking at Moving to Saginaw,/r/Saginaw/comments/qovz3h/looking_at_moving_to_saginaw/hjq2qrb/,14,r/Saginaw,0,14
"I'm going to be the negative Nancy here

Don't move to Saginaw if you don't have a reason 

It's a dump. Do you like high crime? They have shootings every fucking day. 18 or 19 homicides this year so far. Your car and house can get broken into if your neighbors aren't watching. Hell they will even steal your air conditioner condenser and pipes!

Car insurance is stupid expensive because of Michigan and the property crime rate. Many drivers here don't have insurance anyway.

Jobs? Hahhahaha. Everyone moves away after they go to school because there aren't many prospects. There are some good companies in there area but there's really not much here.

What do you guys do? There a couple fields where you could get a decent job pretty quick.

The east side is the worst and you definitely don't want to live there but the west side is pretty bad now. Especially near the hospital or by stone school. 

House are cheap in the city because nobody wants to live there. Your water bill will be a hundred bucks a month and you have to pay for trash pickup too. It's mostly renters, single baby mommas with tons of kids and idiots that want to play loud music all day and night and park cars in the yard. The schools are terrible because the kids are bad and the parents so t give a fuck.

If you must I would try to find a cheap house as far in the township. Still poor job prospects but at least it will be quiet and you won't have shootings on your street....yet. The crime is slowly going to bay city and Saginaw township.

Commercial? Maybe. Residential? ***FUCK***. ***NO***.

To give you an idea, a lot of houses in Saginaw were built sometime around the mid 1900s, or in the transitional period between the mid and late 1900s. So electrical is outdated, plumbing is shoddy, and a lot of houses are straight up being bulldozed. The Carrolton neighborhood is a little better, but many of those houses don't escape what plagues most properties in the Saginaw area, and that being that they're pretty small, not just house wise, but yard wise as well. Carrolton does have some areas where the yards are more spacious, but it's not a guarantee.

So properties here are usually pretty cheap, for those reasons.

"“The OK City.” Perfect tagline - that about sums it up.

When friends from larger cities around the state (Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, etc.) visit, I feel as though I’m apologizing for the relative lack of things to do around town. However, for myself and my family, I very rarely feel deprived of anything. It’s only in contrast that it seems lame, imho. As mentioned, there’s plenty of other places to go/things to do within 30 minutes, too.

I’m in the township, and it’s never felt unsafe to me. We spend plenty of time outside the township, and though there are definitely sketchy areas, it’s not hard to avoid them. I used to go to Old Town frequently, and although it’s not ideal to hang out there into the wee hours of the morning, I’ve never had any issues. It seems to me that the city in general is on the upswing (as far as new businesses, not real estate prices) but maybe that’s optimistic.

"Do not under any circumstances ever buy a car without a title.

Also, just an FYI, even if a car does have a title, make sure you look it over and ensure that there is no active lien on the car. A lien (if there is one) will be indicated on the front of the title and means that the owner owes money to a lender or bank and the car cannot be sold or transferred until the loan is paid in full.

Once a car loan is paid off the owner either receives a lien release paper with the signature of the lender's employee/representative that they give to you attached along with the title. Or, in some cases, the lien area on the title itself will have a signature and indicate the lien is released.

If you want to drive 45 minutes to an hour you can be in the forest or a river or lake. I highly recommend eating at the Maple grille in Hemlock. Check out their menu on Facebook, it changes every day. Everything is fresh, locally sourced and cooked on a wood fire. Also craft beer made there.

"Ok, so... You can't think of the Saginaw area as ""Saginaw"".

There's 3 cities/towns right together, hence ""the Tri-City Area"", Bay City, Saginaw, and Midland.  Each has its own stuff.  

For sports, there's The Great Lakes Loons in Midland (Minor League baseball - affiliated with the Dodgers).  In the winter, Saginaw has the Saginaw Spirit, an OHL hockey team (16-20 year olds - gateway to the NHL).

For outdoors, there are several walking/biking trails in all three.  There's a nature area in Saginaw township, one in Shields, a bike/walk trail that goes from Saginaw township to the next township over (Kochville).

Or, you go to Bay City and they have a nice river walk on both sides of the river (and in summer, downtown BC is where you go for concerts and fireworks).  

There's the Children's Zoo.  The Saginaw Art museum.  The Japanese Tea Gardens.  There's a man made lake in Saginaw (the name escapes me right this second) so you can swim, paddle board, etc.

Like racing?  Got dirt racing at Tri City Speedway in BC, or go south to Birch Run to Dixie Motor Speedway.

Saginaw Symphony Orchestra (which usually performs in the Temple Theater which HAS to be seen to be appreciated), Midland Center for the Arts.  Also, Bay City state park fire camping on the bay.

There's stuff.  But you gotta bounce from town to town.

Plus, you're an hour and a half from Tawas, and you're right on Lake Huron.",t2_gct6x,MrValdemar,0,1625084982.0,0,t1_h3lpcxe,h3lpcxe,False,[deleted],t3_ob2m2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Saginaw/comments/ob2m2y/moving_soon/,Moving soon,/r/Saginaw/comments/ob2m2y/moving_soon/h3lpcxe/,16,r/Saginaw,0,16

Green Point is also nice and part of the flats, but it's on the other side of the Tittabawassee.

----------

SAGINAW, MI - The defunct beans elevator featuring Saginaw’s iconic “beans bunny” sign will be coming down to make room for Saginaw Public Schools’ new comprehensive high school campus, Superintendent Ramont Roberts said.

The district has a contract agreement to buy the building, located at 1741 N. Niagara St., Roberts said. The district’s new high school will be built along the Saginaw River at the current Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy site as part of a $100 million bond millage project voters approved in November 2020. The elevator site will make room for an arena-style athletic fieldhouse and football stadium, Roberts said.

“We knew we were gonna have to acquire property when that site was chosen as the site for the new high school,” Roberts said. “We just didn’t know if we were gonna be able to or not.”

The district intends to preserve the sign, a 50 foot-long landmark that has stood over Saginaw’s skyline for decades, Roberts said.

“We’ll work with individuals who would like to preserve some of the historical artifacts of the city,” Roberts said. “I understand the bean elevator and that sign holds a historical significance to the city.”

The building was originally a grain elevator but later became associated with the Michigan Bean Company, said local historian Thomas Mudd, founder of the Saginaw Valley Historic Preservation Society.

The company’s president originally put a similar sign on the building around World War I, Mudd said, which lasted until the late 30′s but was turned off because of the difficulty of maintaining it.

“The letters had incandescent bulbs in them, and above that was a flag using red, white and blue bulbs to make it look like the flag was waving,” Mudd said.

The current sign came in 1947 and lasted until 1985, according to previous MLive reporting, after the neon lights on the sign were deemed too expensive and dangerous to maintain, Mudd said. The bean-packaging plant itself closed in 1993.

After the closure, Mudd undertook a campaign to spread the sign’s history and solicit donations to restore it. On July 4, 1997, the sign lit up once more, funded by selling plush bunnies to interested residents, he said.

“There was a lot of sentiment in the community to save the sign and restore the sign, bring it back to life,” Mudd said. “People always associated the sign with coming home, it always had that feeling of coming home late at night in the car as a child.”

The sign stayed on until 2009, when a rainstorm with heavy winds took out so much of the neon that Mudd and others decided to end the project, he said.

“From 2009 on, the sign has been dark,” Mudd said. “The only problem is... once you take that bean bunny off there, it loses its significance, it loses its identity.”

The building was not going to last forever despite its age and historical significance, Mudd said, and he doesn’t hold any sentiment for the elevator itself. He’s going to feel bad if it’s torn down, but unless there’s a use for it, he can’t see why it should stay up. However, getting rid of the building also gets rid of much of the sign’s stature, he said, and he’s not sure it’s worth keeping the sign around without the building.

“It’s sad, but I can’t see the sign having the kind of significance once it’s off its lofty perch overlooking the city,” Mudd said. “A lot of people are going to be really upset when they hear what I say about that.”

Identity is a huge part of the sign’s enduring appeal, and there are many difficult issues to sort out when trying to move the sign somewhere else, Mudd said. You need a high place to put it, most likely on a tall building that is going to endure. The neon lights would need to be replaced by LEDs. Someone needs to provide electricity and ongoing maintenance. The act of cutting it down will be difficult. And all of that will require quite a bit of money, Mudd said.

“This is not a simple project,” Mudd said. “It’s very easy for people to say ‘save the sign’ until they see everything they would have to do to save the sign.”",t2_406ji,EatMoreFiber,0,1618504015.0,0,t1_gumcnjc,gumcnjc,False,EatMoreFiber,t3_mrhxde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Saginaw/comments/mrhxde/saginaws_iconic_beans_bunny_sign_coming_down/,"Saginaw’s iconic ‘beans bunny’ sign coming down, making way for new school athletic complex",/r/Saginaw/comments/mrhxde/saginaws_iconic_beans_bunny_sign_coming_down/gumcnjc/,9,r/Saginaw,0,9

"Gotcha. Well, it really depends on what y’all like to do and I am not sure what is all open now due to COVID but;
The Japanese Cultural Center in Saginaw has a nice garden to walk in and you can sign up for a tea ceremony. It is fairly inexpensive and really chill.
Both the Temple Theater in Saginaw and the State Theater in Bay City are historic theaters that are gorgeous and super impressive. They do movies, concerts,  have comedians, etc. The Temple theater also has the Leopard Lounge open for some events and it is a trip ( bar with cozy booths and leopard carpet everywhere). Shiawassee National Wildlife refuge is in Saginaw County and has hiking trails and a drive you can go through to see wildlife. LOTS of birds to be see, even flocks of white Pelicans sometimes! Bay City State Park is nice too. There is a walk around the lagoon/beach, and hiking trails with lookout towers to see the marshland. In Midland, I really cannot recommend Dow Gardens enough. It is a beautiful, manicured garden to stroll through. They have outdoor concerts and events too, like butterflies in the greenhouse. They also have an elevated canopy walk so you can walk up in the trees in the Whiting Forest area. Dow Diamond is in Midland too, where the minor league baseball team plays ( the Loons). Kokomo’s in Saginaw has laser tag, mini gold, bumper boats, etc. That is fun. Also, I really like the planetarium in Bay City ( A good activity sober, or not if you are 420 friendly, haha). Oh, also, the Marshall Fredricks sculpture gallery on SVSUs campus is small but very cool!

A big issue in the area is new patient waitlist. Some are six months to a year. You might be better off going to med express. But I would recommend going to your insurance website and start calling around to see who is accepting new patients then call and ask about their waitlist.
