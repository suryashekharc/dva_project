"> I can't comprehend how some Alaskans think.

Most people don't. They regurgitate whatever they see and hear from talk radio, pod casts, or news sources. I've caught myself doing it a few times. It takes real effort to look for good sources and figure stuff out for yourself.

It's something that we got used to journalists doing for us. We don't have many of those anymore, though.

"Looking at it in pure monetarily terms isn't, at least for me, the best indicator. For me looking at it in what the average person gets for their time, effort, and skill is a better indicator, they may make less and get taxed more but they also can generally do more and have more time away from work than an average US citizen. Beyond free healthcare, they also tend to have free or even paid higher education. They have more paid time off for building families. Most jobs actually allow a living wage to allow anyone willing to work the ability to afford food and shelter, only working one job. In cities there is a focus on robust public transportation, meaning that extra money going towards a truck probably isn't needed, unless you have it for a business, at which it should be worth the investment to make you money. Even with all of the public investment, most of their businesses are privately held, and the income gap between owner's and workers isn't as significant as it is in the states. 

In the states you might pay less taxes, but for a lot of people every expense is on themselves. You mentioned that older people there might not be seen as quickly, that sucks, but seeing as they had the option to preventive medicine many of the harsher symptoms of old age are caught earlier. Also the savings they got would allow them to pay for private entities if it was bad enough. Personally I think focusing on the general working class when it comes to healthcare is a smarter move, especially since they tend to retire or leave the workforce earlier as well. They have less people who stay in the work force past their 50's and 60's and the ones that do are also less likely to be in as labour intensive positions as those in the states. People leaving the work force in their 50's and 60's also leaves room for younger generations to move up and make more money. That is partially why a lot of those countries fared better during the recessions of the last few decades.

"People in the Nordic region have a tax rate of 55-57 percent of their income.  It is a high cost for what they get.  It hits the poor really hard.  Plus, they have a 25 percent VAT tax.  You would be surprised what the average Nordic person brings home.  They also have a GDP on par with Missouri and Connecticut.   Businesses pay no taxes.  

They might get free health care, but it also favors the young.  If you are over 65-70, you might not get the life-saving surgery you need.   If you in the eighties and need a hip replacement?  It is not going to happen.  

If you own a truck, you are going to pay 1200 dollars in taxes for it.  Not only do you make less, but you are taxed to death.  Americans pay an average of 27 percent of their income in taxes.

"Who gets to decide what is good for them?  We just want liberty and to be left alone.  We don't want indoctrination. We don't want socialism thrust down our throats.  We want a state where we can hunt, fish, hike, and explore.    We want good jobs where we can adequately take care of our families.  We want our kids to get a good education.  We want safe neighborhoods and decent roads.  We are tired of extremist environmentalists ruining any opportunity we have for harvesting our resources, but on the flip side, we don't want environmental destruction either.  We want enough fish and game for both sporting and commercial interests.   We need to find the balance point between the two. 

we understand that oil is necessary and we want the state to be able to harvest that resource.  We have several active military bases here, they need to be supported.  We need responsible government and a government that serves the people and not dictate to them.   I would not mind another road to Anchorage from the Matsu valley.

"How so? The many articles I've read argue most convincingly that the only downside to RCV is that ""it's complicated,"" or ""it confuses voters."" These arguments seem nothing more than a perfect start to a race-to-the-bottom scenario. After all, if simplicity in voting is the ideal, then it stands to reason the ideal voter is the simpleton, if you catch my meaning.

"Yes, from the mainland (in Wales), your only possible view of Russia is Big Diomede island.  And from that perspective, Little Diomede island is “in the way”.  The only part of Russia you will actually be seeing is the taller part of Big Diomede that sticks a little bit above Little Diomede, with Little Diomede being in front of it.  You cannot see “mainland Russia”.  There is an FAA Weather Camera (weathercams.faa.gov) at the Wales airport that looks directly (West) at the islands, so you can get a sense of what it looks like (weather permitting).  It’s a very clear day right now, and you can see that you can barely see the islands out there.  It’s a *little* better in the summer when everything is not so white and you can tell what is land and what is water. Right now, the white sea ice blends together nicely with the white snow on the islands.  You can also sometimes see the helicopter or Bering Air aircraft from time to time in these cameras. They park right under the “North” facing camera.

There is also a web camera sitting in the school building of Little Diomede that points down at the helipad, and across the water toward Big Diomede.  You can get a sense of what you would actually see of Russia in both of these cameras.  The view from Little Diomede island is WAYYY better. If you can get there. Lol

The entire thing will be a surprise so i really felt as long as we make the journey there and i point and tell her what shes facing then it would be a success. It was a bucketlist crazy idea we had when we first started dating so i guess my point is to show her i remembered and to show her the effort ill put out for her. Ibhad another thread where a lotnof people told me the chances of being stuck on little diomede for weeks so i changed my idea to wales i figured that would be more realistic. We have 4 kids so we cant get stuck out there that long lol,t2_iw6ol4q,iIdentifyasToaster,0,1648924121.0,0,t1_i34wu41,i34wu41,False,iIdentifyasToaster,t3_tuhoj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/tuhoj9/how_to_travel_to_wales/,How to travel to wales?,/r/alaska/comments/tuhoj9/how_to_travel_to_wales/i34wu41/,1,r/alaska,0,1

"As has already been mentioned, Bering Air will fly to Wales, but “seeing” the island of Big Diomede (Russia) is going to be (very little) hit and (more likely) miss.  Another option is to take the helicopter service out to Little Diomede Island.  Even on crappier weather days when you cannot see either island from Wales, if it’s good enough to fly “da choppa” it will be good enough to see Bid Diomede which is only about 2 miles across the channel. 

Pathfinder Aviation is the operator who runs the helicopter service to between Nome and Little Diomede.  Tickets are $350 each way.  There is a weekly passenger service every Monday, and a weekly mail run every Wednesday.  Passengers are allowed on the mail run on a space/weight available basis only.  If you take the passenger flight, you will only be there for about 5 to 10 minutes.  They do not shut down the helicopter - they land, people get off, people get on, they go.  You would have just enough time to get off, get on your knee, and get back on… she’d better not hesitate with her answer! Lol.  (Seriously, though, both pilots (one pilot at a time) assigned to this run will do what they can to accommodate you including probably taking your picture, if you talk to them ahead of time about what it is you want to do. Their names are Mike and Zack and are both great guys who have been doing this for a long time.)  

If you’re REALLY lucky, and there is room on the mail run, you can stay a little bit longer on Little Diomede.  They fly some mail on the helicopter from Nome, but the majority of the freight is hauled to Wales by Bering Air on a more daily basis and stored there.  Pathfinder makes a run to the island with lighter stuff, and then makes 2 or 3 shuttles back and forth between the island and Wales, before heading back to Nome.  If the pilot knows your plans, and they know if the weights in both directions will allow you to fly in the space-a seats, they will leave you there on the island for an hour or two while they make their shuttles back and forth. 

BEWARE!!!  These flights are VERY heavily weather dependent. About 40% of the flights are delayed by a day or two, and sometimes there is no weather for a week or more. It is not uncommon for them to have a very busy Saturday where they first do the passengers from the previous Monday, and then go do the mail from the previous Wednesday.  If you plan your trip to Nome on a very tight schedule, you have a good chance at being disappointed with the flights getting bumped and bumped and bumped.  There’s room for 9 passengers, and tickets are first come first serve - but you can buy them in advance.  If you choose to go this route, I would suggest planning on a week long vacation to Nome, arriving on Sunday, and hoping that the helicopter flight gets to do one of those days that week.  

If there is no space on the passenger run or the mail run, you CAN charter the helicopter and spend several hours on Little Diomede being a tourist (there’s like 5 buildings to look at), but it’s going to run around $10,000.  They will take you to the island, drop you off for a while, and go sit over on Wales to wait before coming back to pick you up.   (They do not shut down on the island because the helipad is too small to get a second helicopter in there in the unlikely event that something mechanical prevents them from leaving).",t2_11bsyn,jiminak,0,1648922491.0,0,t1_i34tab7,i34tab7,True,iIdentifyasToaster,t3_tuhoj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/tuhoj9/how_to_travel_to_wales/,How to travel to wales?,/r/alaska/comments/tuhoj9/how_to_travel_to_wales/i34tab7/,7,r/alaska,0,7

"I’m going to try not to be a huge downer here, but this endeavor is a huge logistical and economical nightmare for a very slim-to-none chance that you achieve the goal of seeing Russia from Wales. The way to get there would most certainly be to fly. Wales is over 100 miles from Nome, so you’d fly into Nome, and from there get on a much smaller plane to Wales. Bering Air goes there twice daily most days when weather permits, and a RT ticket will run you $250 per person. There really aren’t many lodging accommodations of any kind in Wales. There’s maybe one or two places that you can contact through the Wales native corporation, but more often than not, everywhere is full because of transient workers. Also, no restaurants and no banking services. Best bet would be to plan on staying in Nome. Once you’ve arrived there… here’s the deal… it’s foggy there like, A LOT. Even on a nice day, seeing Russia across the Bering Strait is like trying to see Catalina Island from LA. Not technically impossible, but very unlikely. Annoyingly, if it is a clear day, you’ll have a pretty good chance of seeing Russia on the plane ride to/from there. Airfare RT from Anchorage to Nome will run you somewhere around $400/ea. A semi-decent hotel room in Nome can be anywhere from $200-450+ per night depending on the time of year. Add in probably $40 per person per day worth of groceries/ take-out, cab fares, etc… With a comfy buffer, I’d guess no less than $2500 for a two day trip, staying in Nome and just briefly visiting in Wales.

"When the sea galley burnt down I worked in Anchorage supporting adults experiencing intellectual developmental disabilities.

Knew a guy with a diagnosis of autism and he worked in a rural Alaska cannery many moons ago and developed a DEEP hatred for freezing fish vs canning. Still ate frozen fish, but hated the act of it happening because it was something he had to relearn (his words here). Deep hatred for farmed salmon also. 

He hated the sea galley with a deep passion because they served farmed salmon and fish not from Alaska. 

Like he would ruminate on this and ruin hours of his own day with the thoughts if we drove by it.

He likes to celebrate 9/11 (shock value gained from others) with burning something... Like his parents shed or garden.... Mom's recipe book..

I rode my bike commuting to work the day the sea galley burnt and I rode by it as they were putting it out.

I was just so sure ""oh god, Dave did it. Dave burnt down the sea galley.""

Got to work. Coworkers mentioned it burning and the first thing they said was ""Do you think Dave did it?..."" Then we all started thinking. ""shit, I guess he did it finally"".

Then we mentioned this to our boss and she got in touch with his guardian to learn that he was at work early that morning and spent the time before sleeping then getting ready.

""Here’s what we could gather about Sarah Palin’s life these days: She lives, at least most of the time, in the same house on Lake Lucille in Wasilla that the family has occupied for more than a decade. She applies for a Permanent Fund dividend every year, which would indicate she spends the majority of the year in Alaska.

"I called DNR, and the guy in charge of program is very helpful.

There are no production requirements. You just have to show it's agriculture. Even all fields in fallow would count. It's mostly about the clearing the certain amount in the first 5 years. Then you cannot do something to the land that would be hugely detrimental to agricultural potential.

I asked about farming cannabis and he has some personal opinions against it but DNR doesn't care he said. 

There is zero property taxes and zero permitting and beyond the agriculture requirement zero zoning. It is in the unorganized borugh 

You show them a plan showing your farm layout, what area you are gonna build a homesite, garage , barn etc etc and they ensure you aren't doing something like planting a potato field on a steep hill or building in a wet land zone. 

Be very cautious of buying wetland up here. Just don't buy land with much IMO.

"Honestly there isn't much to worry about in terms of the difficulty of traveling in Alaska. If you've traveled alone in other countries then you'll do just fine. Some roads can be rough, and obviously there are many places with no cell service, but just get a recent map or a GPS and make sure you're always prepared (snacks/water/extra clothes/etc.) and there's not much of a concern. If you plan on camping then a little more caution is recommended of course, but a can of bear spray and proper camping etiquette will eliminate most of that.

"Aviation rules-wise. There are a few populated areas with special rules but this state has by far the most unrestricted airspace. Yes, GA is expensive, but there are *affordable* alternatives.

I totally agree with that aspect concerning cost. But snow machines cost as much as snow machines regardless of where you buy it.

And, you're probably right. Those places are great too. But circumstances left me in Alaska and I had already started to love it. I probably would not have initially chosen to live here, but after coming here I knew it was home.

___

I was running from people. These people happen to lack initiative and Alaska has provided a tedious obstacle that they are reluctant to navigate. It's not a place you can ""drop in"" on with affordability and ease. It is foreign enough to them to stay away. And after decades I can say confidently, that it works.

Yes, the video is correct in that coming here without a bulletproof plan is the epitome of stupid, but intelligence, forethought, and willpower can be just as effective as stupid and empirical.

"I moved to Fairbanks for a job in 2015 and only lasted a bit under two years. I could only do one summer. I was crazy and miserable that one summer. The 24 hour daylight, the mud, the tourist, the big slow bugs; it was a lot to put up with imho. Also the reality that it is, literally, the end of the road.  You’ll find a lot of misfit toys up there.  Being a single person I found it pretty miserable and swore I’d only go back if I was in a relationship/ had support.  The Thai food is incredible though. That was one of the best parts.  I don’t mind winter and loved the twinkle and colors during that time but March is very very long. So was April.  
I’ve returned to work along the inner passage and think a little about working in Anchorage but I don’t think I would.  Anchorage is just another city surrounded by Alaska.  I hear it’s spreading too. 
I’d move to Juneau in a heartbeat but then your dealing with a lot of tourists also. 
So it depends on where you land and if you are honestly ok with loneliness and a lot of weird (but sometimes very interesting and fun). 

Right now I’m not seeing salaries match the increasing cost of living so that makes it much less worth the expense to move there.

"Sure I understand that visitors are likely not going to eat muktuk, or seal, or bear. That's why I left those items out of the list of traditional foods that visitors can find. 
Most visitors are only gonna get salmon halibut and crab. And that's probably for the best. 
But some may want to be more adventurous. And how many of these items the visitor tries is depends on the visitor and how much work they put in. 
Some visitors are here for the day, some for a week , some for the whole summer.
Some people might want to try a berry, some might try to catch their own king and others might try to shoot their own moose($$$$). 

But more importantly, I was pointing out that some of the best meals I've had here have been harvested by friends, family, elders and I. The distinction that you have between traditional Alaskan Native foods that are available and the ""interesting stuff"" may be arbitrary. Though I am mostly unfamiliar with the interiors cusine and laws regarding food if they vary by borough. 

 Smoked salmon is traditional Tlingit food, it's a part of the culture. And it is very easy to find smoked salmon here in south east for sale to tourists.  Except for the fact that I add butter instead of seal oil, I would argue that cuisine made from ingredients foraged here in Alaska are traditional staple foods which are indeed available to the public if they put in the work and money to try it as visitors. Otherwise they can eat mc Donald's.

"Quite the rant. Outdoor access in Alaska aside from north of the Brooks Range for the most part is actually quite accessible and not as cost prohibitive as he describes. If you live in any of the “large cities” you can literally load up a pack and head out. Sure you need to know what is up but the wilderness effect here surpasses any location in the lower 48 without question. If you do this in the SW lower 48 there are maniacal hordes of tourists and unbearable summer temps. Hell, Moab sees more fatalities in a season than remote Alaska without question. And cost wise, good luck not spending as much at a SW National park and having an experience on a similar level. I’ve done both and Alaska wins every single time. 

FWIW I don’t snow machine or ride 4 wheelers. Mountain biking in the SW is better but it’s all technical riding. I prefer BC for any of that and that means I have to live in Washington.

"AX is a good company to work for. The zip line tour was really fun and the only one I’ve been on where they encouraged us to try flipping off the platform (but if you just wanted to jump off that was totally ok). The owner can be quirky but he’s pretty funny and generally a nice guy. Be prepared for some long days and a lot of customers per day. But the scenery out in Dyea (where the zip line and dog mushing tours are) is gorgeous and historic. 

If you do decide to come to Skagway:
Try to set aside a few days to enjoy yourself while you are here. I’ve spent too many summers accepting all the hours I could possibly work and covering for others and regretted not going to some events like the fair in Haines. 
If you don’t have a passport I highly recommend getting one. The drive up the pass and to Whitehorse is the most beautiful drive, though the drive down the Seward Highway (south of Anchorage) does give it a run for it’s money.

But it kinda sucked working for such a big company and knowing they didn’t personally care for us. They would tell us all the time how their profits were so much higher than expected yet the pay was $11/hr. I didn’t have a pillow for weeks and they wouldn’t let me have a spare one from one of the numerous unused rooms…like cmon lol. We were also terribly understaffed and we had a lot of overtime and had to help in different departments. That being said, it was just a good way to get up here and make a little money and then find better opportunities with smaller, Alaskan-based companies that respect and value their employees.

"I worked there last summer. A couple of things, a car would be nice but getting around without one is still doable between the shuttle and hitchhiking. Don't buy bear spray when you first get up there, lots of people at the resort leave the bear spray at the end of their vacation so the front desk will probably have some they can just give to you. A perk of being front desk is you get to do all the fun activities (rafting, helicopter glacier landing tour ect.) for free at the beginning of the season to have the experience to pass on to customers. If you're not front desk you will have to wait till the end of the season and get lucky to be able to sign up for free tours. As far as gear comes for backpacking, it would be nice to bring your own sleeping bag/tent if you can easily do so but if not there will be stuff you can borrow and there is a gear shop in the canyon or ""glitter gulch"" area where you can rent all types of stuff including bear canisters which you will need.

Of the 3 cars I bought in AK, one was terrible, one was unsafe, and one was the best used car I’ve ever owned.  If you do get a car, people will want to borrow it.  I was pretty nice about lending my car out the first season I was there, but I got burned doing that, so I stopped.

"You massively misinterpreted what the guy asked for when he said gun *rights*. **Rights**. As in, protections to keep access to guns in a not ridiculously inhibitive and/or prohibitive manner. 

You wrote off a dissection of why and how you're wrong with a flippant ""Meh that's not why he lost"" even though a statement like ""Hell yeah, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47"" while simultaneously saying that *systemically racist* law enforcement should be the ones who *control access to guns* is taking guns away from the private citizen and taking away agency of why someone would need a gun.

Would that same *systemically racist* law enforcement allow gun access to ethnic and queer minorities? No, they won't. Would *systemically racist* law enforcement equally and impartially allow gun access? No, they won't.

I don't even know if you understand the difference between gun *rights*, which is what the guy was asking, and gun *control*...And trying to write off a massively intersectional dissection of how race, sexuality, and gender-nonconformity all play a role in hypothetical restriction of exercising and keeping the 2nd amendment as ""one cause"" is intellectually dismissive and dishonest.

I would maybe stay away from Valdez just because it is expensive (food is a big expense and I'm not sure about housing but every time I look for a rental they are scarce and pricey, although town is very walkable), and your kind of stuck out there.  But it is beautiful and fun to visit. 

My complaint about SE Alaska is it reminds me of Cleveland weather a bit...

Wherever you choose, you will make it work and it will be a great experience.

"You’re probably looking at SE (Juneau, maybe Ketchikan, maaaybe Skagway), maybe Seward or Valdez depending on your definition of ‘necessities’ and ‘decent transportation’. Jobs like zip lines out of town in these locations *probably* offer a shuttle for employees of some sort, especially in SE where they aren’t going to expect you to show up with a car. 

Skagway/Juneau/Ketchikan all have some level of public transit. I know at least one of the big day boat operators in Seward offers housing. Not familiar with the setups in SE, but wouldn’t be surprised if some of the bigger companies there did as well.

Apply to anything that looks interesting and ask these questions to a recruiter. Take vague ‘oh it’s fine’ as a red flag to any of your important questions. They’ll all be desperate for help this summer, so ask lots of questions and make sure you feel good about whoever you choose. 

Also: can be worth checking employer reviews on Glassdoor, etc. Lots of disgruntled former seasonal employees out there, but look for systemic issues: ‘housing was moldy’, ‘promised employee shuttle didn’t exist’, ‘boat kept sinking’, etc.",t2_9jisa10y,akrdubbs,0,1648701913.0,0,t1_i2t6ujs,i2t6ujs,True,Mean-Spinach3488,t3_tsr4t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/tsr4t0/seasonal_job_tipstravel_advice/,Seasonal Job Tips/Travel Advice,/r/alaska/comments/tsr4t0/seasonal_job_tipstravel_advice/i2t6ujs/,2,r/alaska,0,2

In scientific studies conducted by University of Calgary grizzly-bear expert Stephen Herrero, bear spray was found to be 94% effective in deterring aggressive bears. Unlike a gun, bear spray does not have to be aimed precisely to stop a charging bear.

"What they are calling the Pt. Mackenzie dock is little more than a barge dock at the moment.  There is far more to a ""port"" than just the dock. ;). Given that half of everything offloaded would need to go by truck back through Wasilla to Anchorage, it wouldn't help congestion.  Containerships need container cranes and tankers need tank farms.  It's already a pita to keep the Anchorage dock clear of ice for the ships, doubling the area needed to keep ice free might be an issue. 


The disaster that was the port of Anchorage upgrade was predicted to happen before they ever started.  They essentially chose a technique that was used successfully for a handful of small docks in western Alaska and tried to scale it up to about 10 times the size of the largest dock they'd ever done before.  Many people had questions, but the ""right"" people settled on the design because it was patented by a certain company.........

I've always thought they should move the air freight business to Pt. Mackenzie.  Perfect place for it and I hate it when the wide bodies take off to the east and fly over my home on the hillside.  Move it to the valley.  What do I care if my packages take 4hrs longer to get delivered. ;)


That last bit was me just being snarky. :D

Seriously though........those jets are loud!  Thankfully it rarely happens and the usually pass closer to Stuck again heights than flat top. :)

It would be possible to put the air freight business out there.  Most of their fuel comes by barge so you could  probably get that over the existing dock with small modifications.

"Why the aurora are more active in the spring and autumn is not fully understood yet,  but has been an area of active study for decades.     
It at least partially has to do with the interaction between the earth's magnetic field (which tilts with the earth) and the sun's.    
When the sun's magnetic field lines up in certain orientations with the earth's, it cancels out a portion of the earth's field at the point of contact, opening a door for increased energy from solar winds to reach the inner magnetosphere.

"I have noticed that auto insurance policies aren’t like other services or goods: loyalty programs and “grandfather’d” policies actually cost more than switching agencies.

I shop around every 6 months or so to see if anyone can provide me the same coverage for less. Every once or two years I actually find another company that can - I just switched to Statefarm this month and saved a bit. You can bet I’ll be searching again to see if I can reduce my rates in 6 months; because there’s no loyalty discount worth staying with one agency. Shop around: insurance markets are pretty cut throat and one company is usually willing to undercut another’s price just to bring you in.

Assuming the vehicle gets 30mpg on the highway and has a 16 gallon tank that's roughly 500 miles per fill-up and average $6.50 a gallon (greatly weighted to Canada's gas prices) that's five fill-ups on the way up.  16x6.50x5=$520.

Why drive through Denali without stopping?  2 days in Homer and Seward is probably too much, but then again, Ive spent a lot of time in both.  The only exception would be if you plan to do some fishing...
