- there’s a square for food trucks that’s super cute with a variety of different cuisines (1073 E El Camino Real), the Catos Mexican one is amazing, love their burritos! 
- Madras Cafe is a super famous South Indian brunch place, their Dahi Vada is super yumm  
- If you are into beer, Narrative Fermentations is a great brewery in San Jose not too far from here 
- Hanabusa Cafe is apparently famous for their soufflé pancakes (I’ve never been myself, but my friend in South Korea was talking about it and it’s apparently a big deal)

"Here are some of my favorite spots:

Sunnyvale: Dish Dash: (Mediterranean food) hands down is the best restaurant in downtown Sunnyvale. I’ve never had a bad meal.

Dish N Dash: Fast Casual Mediterranean food.  Fresh ingredients, Everything is amazing! On Mathilda closer to 101. There’s also multiple locations.

Bibimbowl: Fast Casual Korean. Great build your own rice bowls. Located near Mary Ave. and Maude Ave.

Falafel Stop: Israeli/Mediterranean food. Delicious!!!! Also build your own plate. Always a long line but they move fast. Definitely worth the wait. Mathilda and Fremont intersection.

Pho Lovers: The name says it all. Hella good. Located on East Maude Ave.

Merit Vegan restaurant: I’m not vegan but the food is amazing! Long wait at peak hours but totally worth it!

Saravannna Bhavan: South Indian vegetarian. One word: Flavorful

Country Gourmet: pretty good American food. Intersection of Mary Ave and Fremont Ave

Lilly Macs: my favorite Irish pub in Downtown Sunnyvale. Love to go and have a glass of wine and a steak salad.

Jang Su Jang: In Santa Clara, Amazing Korean BBQ!!

Mountain View:

Ramen Yugen: Hella Good Ramen!

Oren’s Hummus: great Mediterranean

Cascal: Latin Tapas. Nice ambiance. Good food.

QBB: BBQ and Bourbon. Great selection of Bourbons and Whiskeys

Steins Beer Garden: Nice spot to drink and hangout with friends. Nice outdoor area.

Blue Line Pizza: killer deep dish pizza

Mervyns: Dive Bar it’s kinda behind a boba tea spot.

Cheztakos! : taco truck. Not downtown. At night they’re in a liquor store parking lot on El Camino. During the daytime they’re located in the Kelly More parking lot next to Mountain View BMW on El Camino.  This taco truck is legit 🔥🔥🔥

"I live in this exact area right now. It's very safe for walking and biking (even at night), however, bay area drivers are something else. There are several LinkedIn and Apple campuses right there that are nice to walk through. You also have LinkedIn and Apple security cars patrolling basically 24/7.

The most ""sketchy"" part would be near the Lucky grocery store, but it's not that sketchy. You just see homeless people hanging out there a lot and they usually don't even ask you for anything.

If you're into Indian food there is ""Little India Cafe"" which is S-tier Indian food.

**Edit:** One small tip I have after living here is to avoid the Evelyn & Mary intersection when you're trying to go N on Mary. It probably happens in the morning too, but around 4-5 PM Caltrains go by there pretty often and the light system is completely fucked. Each time a train goes by it resets to the same loop, so if a second train comes within 2 minutes of the first train leaving you are stuck there if you are driving Northbound on Mary.

Southbound is slightly better based on the timing of the light, but you are also prone to getting stuck.

"Oh, hey. I used to live in Midland! Stop laughing.

Sunnyvale is super nice, mostly, but really expensive because there's good schools. You could probably find a more affordable place to live in the East Bay or South Bay, but you'll be adding a heinous commute as well. Gotta figure out the pros and cons. Like I said, I'm sure there's cheaper places in Sunnyvale itself that was just my rent for my one apartment that I had until September 2021.

"If you're going to live anywhere on the Sunnyvale side of downtown San Jose, your best bet is probably to live in a 3-4 bedroom place with 2-3 roommates.

">Also, how is public transport in general in California?

California is too large to generalize about public transportation. Sunnyvale is served by the Valley Transportation Agency (VTA).

The Amazon offices in north Sunnyvale are served by the Lockheed Martin transit center at Mathilda and 5th Street. There are two main bus lines that stop there: the VTA 56 and the VTA 523. The VTA light rail orange line also stops nearby.

You can look up the bus maps and schedules at [https://www.vta.org/](https://www.vta.org/)

VTA buses are moderately reliable, but they are slow; and their routes do not provide great coverage. If you live near a bus stop, and your destination is near a bus stop, and your trip does not involve a transfer, then it's doable.

A lot of employers run shuttles in the area -- you should ask whether Amazon offers such a service.

"Years ago when I was in college I used to work for U-Haul in another area of the country. I can't answer all your questions but I can answer some of them.

* Typically one-way moves are more expensive than in-town, however U-Haul's one-way fleet is significantly newer and nicer than the in-town trucks (which are retired one-way trucks that have too much mileage to be reliable over long distances). However, one-way rates can occasionally be really cheap if the truck is going to an area that needs that type of truck. You can quote rates on their website, so just do that to compare.
* For in-town rentals, there is no variable rate in any sense, it's just a flat fee and then a cost per mile (which is higher on weekends IIRC). You can use this to estimate your total cost and compare to a one-way rental. For one-way rentals, no, there was no difference in price based on booking day like airlines, the price on any given rental period is solely based on the known supply and demand for that period.
* As previously mentioned, weekends have a higher mileage rate than weekdays. Everybody also tries to move at the end of the month for obvious reasons, so demand spikes then, in-town trucks are hard to get, and U-Haul raises the prices on one-ways. The cheapest rates are going to be weekdays that are closer to the middle of the month.

EDIT: One more tip, always pay for their collision damage waiver at a minimum! U-Haul is super crappy about litigating over the dumbest things and credit cards do NOT provide a damage waiver for moving trucks like they do for rental cars. You do not want your move to be ruined because they find a scratch on it that wasn't noted when you left and take you to court over it.",t2_dhq8f9z,FaxedForward,0,1647122539.0,0,t1_i0f55r8,i0f55r8,True,[deleted],t3_tcq954,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sunnyvale/comments/tcq954/moving_questions_uhaul_from_sf/,Moving questions (U-Haul from SF),/r/Sunnyvale/comments/tcq954/moving_questions_uhaul_from_sf/i0f55r8/,13,r/Sunnyvale,0,13

Other states were able to address the concerns of officer safety by putting the scanners on a delay, like in Oregon.  Somehow their officers are managing to stay safe.

Kind of an industrial neighborhood, not much of a walk around downtown experience, which tends to be the more expensive new rentals. Probably would be a good place to start exploring the rest of the peninsula.

I don't have a rating. I have never played the sport competitively. But I say I'm beginner-intermediate because I know my strokes fairly well, but there's a lot more I need to work on.

Yeah I've considered taking coaching which will obviously improve my game, strokes etc. But it gets pretty expensive as each session of an hour is like $60-80 which can get pretty expensive per month even if I want to play twice a week.",t2_1f3igkef,perceptron333,0,1645413868.0,0,t1_hxse9dk,hxse9dk,False,perceptron333,t3_sx9tdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sunnyvale/comments/sx9tdn/looking_for_pingpong_tabletennis_partners/,Looking for ping-pong / table-tennis partners,/r/Sunnyvale/comments/sx9tdn/looking_for_pingpong_tabletennis_partners/hxse9dk/,2,r/Sunnyvale,0,2

"1250 Lakeside is brand new and has only been open for a few weeks.  So it's impossible to get seasoned reviews.

There is one restaurant next door (Faultline) and a McDonald's nearby and a few more restaurants beyond that (generally good).  There are a two of empty restaurant locations close nearby, but I doubt those will be reoccupied this year.  It's fair to say that the area is a safe place to walk (and sterile / boring too).

You pretty much need to drive to/from that area for any shopping. Closest grocery store is the Wal\*Mart Neighborhood grocery across the freeway.

On the same parcel as 1250 Lakeside they will start building a large hotel building this year.  So your going to get noise from that construction work during the day 5-6 days a week.

There is another big apartment complex coming online at the old AMD campus just across the expressway. The sign out front says: [https://redwoodplaceapts.com/](https://redwoodplaceapts.com/) 855-782-6025 The URL points to another property of theirs, but you could call and ask when they will open.  Probably also expensive.

There are only a dozen or two events each year at the nearby football stadium.  I would not worry about that too much (Sundays mostly). You'll probably have you windows closed anyways since 1250 Lakeside is right next to the freeway.  The Great America Theme Park by the stadium has summertime fireworks.

Everyone has cars because the entire bay has horrible public transit, so everything is accessible and usually within 20mins.

Housing is insane. Most of the jobs (unless you work for apple/google/tech) are far away. City is relatively safe from violent crime, but take care where you lock your bike or park your car and watch out for drivers in certain neighborhoods at night.

We've got a lot of cops, so expect today hi to them pretty frequently. They're jumpy too.

"Sunnyvale resident here. I've lived here for over 10 years, walking distance to our tiny Downtown area. The whole town is sleepy (especially the last 2 years) and reasonably green, the weather has always been great. There is little to say about this town in particular... the whole area from San Jose all the way to South San Francisco is a pretty much a single city... with ""burrows"" flowing from one to the other by the US 101.

Boston and Seattle are real cities. So is San Francisco. The South Bay towns are something else... basically Silicon Valley ""burbs"". 

From what I can tell, people live in these towns because they like the quiet, or the schools or the minimal commute when they happen to have a job in the next 'burb over.

* Don't leave an expensive bike locked up for an extended period of time, especially if out of sight. $1000+, very roughly, is a baseline, but cheaper bikes are certainly targets as well. I've had $300-400 singlespeeds stolen.

* When you lock, use two different styles of lock. I.e. a U-lock plus a cable lock. U-lock through frame and anchor point, and cable lock through wheels and, hopefully, through anchor independent of cable lock. Ideally through wheels and frame and anchor independent of anchor.

"Sorry to hear man. 

This is the reason why I used to walk into the shops holding my bike. I got told so many times I was not welcome in because I could ""hurt someone"" with my bicycle and I should leave it outside. 

I understand, perhaps if the store is really busy or super small ... but in Sunnyvale it very unlikely and if we have to keep 6 feet apart for social distancing I think walking around holding a bike a perfect way to social distance.

Anyway, most of times I didn't want to argue with managers and so I left. I got too many bikes stolen in my life and don't trust leaving my bike outside, even if locked ... especially in this city.

Some people install Air tags on the bike, I think that could be something you could consider for your next bike, and also you should try looking on craiglist and ebay in a few days, perhaps you can find your same bike and report it to the police. 

Really sorry to hear that.

"You seem unnecessarily hostile but since this is covid related it seems important to respond.

Your own source from Northeastern says that we “generally” expect covid to mutate to increase transmission and reduce lethality, but *there are exceptions*. So your source does not disagree with the politifact article (and a pandemic is absolutely a political event), which, if you’d clicked through, you might have seen lists **21** university sources and science journals. The problem is with your use of the term “all” and the word “always” in the header of the statement politifact is responding to. The virus MAY evolve to lower virulence but mutation is a random process and a virus that is MORE lethal and MORE transmissible that still takes a week or more to kill its host is absolutely possible.

"Hi, I had a cat who had regular grand mal seizures. You’re correct, most seizures are over so quickly that there’s not time to get to the vet, and there is zero reason to rush right to the vet or the emergency vet because there’s nothing that can be done directly after a seizure and it’ll just be more stress for your cat. 

The only time you would want to rush your cat to the vet right away would be if the seizure doesn’t stop because that’s an immediate life threatening situation.

You’ll definitely want to get to a vet as soon as you can to find out the reason for the seizure and prevent it from happening again, which it sounds like you’re doing.

Also, Pet’s Friend is the vet I used. I don’t recommend them, find somewhere better.

Edit: it’s helpful to write down everything you can about the seizure, including time and possible triggers, to pass along to the vet.",t2_6xb51,misdy,0,1642144118.0,0,t1_hslm53s,hslm53s,False,FaxedForward,t3_s38ahx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sunnyvale/comments/s38ahx/best_vet_for_cats_in_sunnyvale_or_surrounding_area/,Best vet for cats in Sunnyvale (or surrounding area)?,/r/Sunnyvale/comments/s38ahx/best_vet_for_cats_in_sunnyvale_or_surrounding_area/hslm53s/,3,r/Sunnyvale,0,3

"**[Corvidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae)** 
 
 >Corvidae is a cosmopolitan family of oscine passerine birds that contains the crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. In common English, they are known as the crow family, or, more technically, corvids. Currently 133 species are included in this family. The genus Corvus, including the jackdaws, crows, rooks, and ravens, makes up over a third of the entire family.

 >B3: Battle by the Bay, the B4 Championships, and the B5 Championships were the first three instances of the open fighting game event that is now known as the annual Evolution Championship Series. B3 was created by Tom and Tony Cannon, Joey Cuellar, and Seth Killian, and was held in an arcade hall in Sunnyvale, California in 1996. B4 and B5 were held in Folsom, California in 2000 and 2001 respectively, and the tournament was renamed Evolution in 2002. The three tournaments were entirely focused on the Street Fighter and Capcom Versus video game franchises.

"1. What could you hunt them with that would be safe to use in a densely populated urban area like downtown? I saw an abatement falconer going after them one night about a month ago and it did help for a while but I haven't seen them again since and now the crows have come back with a vengeance.


2. They're noisy af and shit EVERYWHERE. They're like pigeons but worse. It's a health hazard and an eyesore. The city has to power wash the crow shit off the sidewalks daily just to keep them looking passable. Crows aren't an endangered species and are also very aggressive about chasing any other kind of birds away from their territory. There's a lot of people who live and work here. They shouldn't be forced to put up with that kind of unnecessary noise and physical pollution, especially somewhere as expensive as downtown SV.


3. It's COVID. A lot of people don't have a choice but to dine outside right now. The crow problem being so bad it drives people away from eating or even just walking around downtown also further hurts all the restaurants and small business who've already been hit hard by the pandemic.

crime is alright. it's been alleviated by the renovations at fair oaks park but I'm sure it'll ramp up once the renovations are done. most of the crime stays on Maude going towards wolfe, at least from what I've seen


area is pretty walkable. a lot of neighbors are aware and everyone keeps an eye out. obviously, practice common sense. a lot of things are close by on bike, a little farther out walking but all very feasible. i usually wait until Saturdays for the farmers market to do my shopping anyways",t2_2apcy6gv,SavMac14,0,1641868977.0,0,t1_hs5k87u,hs5k87u,True,khakijaguar,t3_s0z8rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sunnyvale/comments/s0z8rv/moving_in/,Moving in,/r/Sunnyvale/comments/s0z8rv/moving_in/hs5k87u/,3,r/Sunnyvale,0,3

there is or was rampant mail theft. the post office on java used to be open 24hrs and now it closes at 8pm. :\

"I live here. It's super bikeable. Tons of stuff is within a 10-15 minute radius including CalTrain and downtown. Also the bay trail.

Walkability depends on your destination. Crossing Lawrence expwy isn't fun. Taj Mahal is a great grocery store but they don't have everything an american supermarket does. Chavez is also good but not comprehensive. The closest supermarket is Lucky's and it's farther than I'd want to walk. I learned to cook lots of Indian food :D

You can't hear the 101 if you're more than a block or so away from it. Safety is a non-issue.

"Haven't lived there but I'm nearby (south of Evelyn).

You won't get train noise but I'd guess the 101 is probably pretty loud unless you're south of Amador.

You're near the Movement climbing gym and the skate park, which are great. Daily Donuts is also a great cheap spot for bagels.

North Sunnyvale is definitely the cheaper end of town, in terms of rent and home prices, and a little more working class, with worse rated schools. There's more crime if you check maps, but all of this stuff is relative. North and East of the 101 is worse.

I'm looking at homes in the Sunnyvale/Santa Clara area and I'd definitely be happy moving there.

The area has a large income inequity in housing. Very low end housing and some very upper end. People without steal from those who have.  It’s a civility problem and people not being raised with good morals and ethics or just decent respect. Those people have kids and the cycle of predatory leeches on society continue.

"My friend’s kid’s bike was stolen near Walgreens in Sunnyvale. She saw it on Craigslist a few days later (it had very specific markings). The police wouldn’t help her. Her friend ended up setting up a meeting to check out the bike “to purchase”, asked to take it for a a quick spin, and rode off with it, giving it back to my friend. This strategy obviously comes with possible risks so I’m not necessarily endorsing it, just letting you know what was required for her to get it back. If you’re unable to retrieve your own bike, there are some robust Buy Nothing Groups on Facebook where you might find something for free. Or, there’s a super nice guy who lives on the west side of Mary, just a block or so south of El Camino, who sells used bikes in his driveway.

"Maybe it’s different now, but I went to Crunch pre-covid and didn’t like it. If you primarily want to use the cardio machines, Crunch is fine. But the weights section gets crowded even during typical off-peak times. There were often large groups taking up all the squat racks and they’d stay there for a looooong time. It felt like a hangout spot for students from Homestead High School and De Anza College, which are just down the street (I went to Homestead and I’d walk over to this plaza for lunch, that’s how close it is). Since they’re students, the large groups can start to show up as early as 12pm.

"I was working as a production eng for 2 years there.  Their manufacturing set up was some of the worst I’ve seen. Their final product of their new servers had a total yield of 45% (not first pass yield), which is ridiculous.  They constantly pushed out quality concerns to just ship things out, even going as far as shipping prototypes to customers which would break and then be replaced with another dying product. 

 Even if you don’t believe me, look at their stock price for the last 6-7 years. They never got back up to double digits and have been hovering at $8 for the past four years.  Then at every quarter, they try to boast that they will somehow beat the big contenders like Huawei even though they are barely above water.

Moving away from someone on a bus might hurt their feelings.  They are struggling with enough problems already.  You really don't want to shun them unless they are acting crazy or are very dirty and malodorous.

There are many local organizations that assist homeless people with meals, hygiene kits, gently used clothing.  I think if you went out as a volunteer with one of ghese groups you would feel more confident about being around homeless people.

"It really isn't common to be attacked by a homeless person.  I've been riding buses in Santa Clara County for 40 years, and I've never had such an unfortunate experience.  You are probably correct that this person was establishing territoriality over that bus stop.

 If he is removed, all or most of his belongings will be thrown out.  Even knowing that, I think you should contact the Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority, aka VTA, our local bus agency.  They are in charge of keeping the bus shelters clean and safe.  

All riders should be able to use the bus system in peace.  You can always tell the bus driver about anything this serious and ask them to report it on their radio for immediate action.

Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it’s too late.

Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances.

Actually, I think it was probably Oakland (in fact, I think most or all of the equipment used in Fleet Week were out of OAK or SFO -- the United Airlines 777 was out of SFO for sure; I tracked it). At least, that is where the Blue Angels' support C-130 hung out (it wouldn't make sense to have your transport vehicle that carries your crews and supplies at a different location). You can see its flight history here: https://flightaware.com/live/flight/VMBA10

What you are seeing from Moffett are different.

Around Fleet Week there were some jets that flew over a Stanford game: https://twitter.com/taiwaneseprick/status/1446523992785842178

Otherwise, the jets provide training aid to the Air Force, according to a Nextdoor post I read. The post explained that they basically mock as the ""bad guy"". I'm trying to see if I can actually find a description somewhere. But I guess https://twitter.com/TacticalAirUS is the company that flies those jets. (Their Twitter has some info on what they do.)

These are some relevant Twitter posts:

https://twitter.com/taiwaneseprick/status/1450522662065737729

EDIT: Some more here: https://twitter.com/cvvhrn (The stuff around Fleet Week also involved the USMC doing a fly over to honor Secretary of State George Schultz. That account also has a re-Tweet of a shot of the Blue Angels' C-130 ""Fat Albert"".)

And this account sometimes posts about it:
https://twitter.com/WatcherCtp

You can track them on www.flightradar24.com. You'll usually see them go out and zip around just north of Monterey over the Pacific.

And sometimes because of visibility the direction the planes take off in will change (I think they usually take off to the south during the fall and winter months).

"Just an opinion.. With nom burger I think their attitudes, especially management killed their business, especially during pandemic. 
Their prices sure were high already, while it was a tasty burger, they were snotty and it was a lot to pay to feel like garbage, and when they ended up takeout only it just got sad.


The weirdest was when I tried to email a complaint to them—around the time of the hot sauce and they immediately responded, but with a fake “this email is out of service” reply. 
They don’t want to hear it and if you look at Yelp reviews you can see how they are sort of the food police over how you eat their food and the mgr seems to have control issues. I hope she leaves the restaurant business bc she was wrecking it.

The opening of the AMC and Whole Foods is a good sign though.  Hopefully more to come.

I'm really bummed about losing Tap't and Nom as I fear they will be replaced with large business chains.  It seemed to me those restaurants were reasonably busy so if they can't make it who can?

"We discovered bed bugs one week after moving in. Reported to the leasing manager. They blamed it on us and made us pay for the treatment. Meanwhile they hired treatment company, who isn't incentivized to treat any bed bugs. They came in with the spray you can get from Home Depot for 20 dollars. Made a few treatment and never solved the problem. 

The leasing office was rude, arrogant, and basically felt fun to watch us get bites. The building 4 had many many incidents but they lied to us and claimed there are no bed bug incident ever. They also called and said they will allow us to pay for the treatment. I don't even know what that means. Sounds like it's our privilege to pay for treatment. They also did not allow us to break the lease because of the bed bugs.

I haven’t had any issues living at Windsor Ridge in general. I think maybe the only comment I have is that the Caltrain is close enough to shake the apartments on the higher floors. Feels like a small earthquake every day, but you kind of just get used to it.

"You should find empty lots of land in multifamily residential areas, and report on why they remain undeveloped into housing.

For example, right next to the apartments at 451 S. Bernardo Ave is one such lot. This lot has been owned by the same person since 1995, who currently lives in a wealthy part of Napa. Thanks to Prop 13, he pays barely any taxes on this property, so he has no incentive to sell the land to anyone who might use it. So instead, he just keeps this empty land in his investment portfolio, enjoying the 10-20% annual gains from rising land values.

You could also survey the abundant supply of blighted retail lots.

Turns out, there's plenty of land that could be used to construct additional dense housing units without tearing down existing detached housing. But to make use of it, we'd have to reform Prop 13 (maybe to only apply to a person's primary residence), or modify retail zoning to be mixed-use.
