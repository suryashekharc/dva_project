"I wish I had seen this post sooner, you may have already made a choice but if you haven’t yet-here goes…I lived in that apartment complex for the past four years. You won’t be stuck up there for days if it snows! The city prioritizes Talus for snowplowing. The apartment complex isn’t super quick with clearing snow/ice from the apartment complex parking lots but you can get in and out. You may have to shovel yourself out of your spot once a year if the area experiences a crazy snowstorm but again that’s maybe once a year and probably likely to be less than a foot of snow in one dumping to deal with. It’s super quiet and a nice place to walk. Traffic up and down the mountain is pretty light. Using “crowded” to describe it may be a bit of an exaggeration, you may have to wait with a dozen or so cars for a light to change but that’s about it on Talus.",t2_z04oiqu,serendipitousLB,0,1648965819.0,0,t1_i36yxti,i36yxti,True,teajoeytristian,t3_s812z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Issaquah/comments/s812z8/anyone_live_or_used_to_live_at_estates_at_cougar/,Anyone live (or used to live) at Estates at Cougar Mountain Apartments?

"I think the ""Seattle Freeze"" isn't really specific to Seattle, but more a symptom of a workaholic culture. We are an area with a lot of people in careers that force a really unhealthy work/life imbalance, with insane cost of living and long commute times, so a lot of people here just don't have time or energy for having much of a social life. I'm talking about people that work in tech, engineering, medicine, etc. As much as I want to meet new people, I often just don't have the time. All my friends are people I've known for over a decade, or people I met through dating sites that just didn't work out as partners but were cool people.

[Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) does have some cool local groups around the area for hiking, dining, and other activities so those are good for meeting new people.

There are a lot of nice trails around Issaquah. The [wta.org](https://wta.org) trail finder map is super useful for figuring out trail locations, filtering by distance, elevation gain, and other parameters.

Food around Issaquah is pretty great. Umi Cafe is super adorable, especially for outdoor seating in the warmer months. Buhkara Indian is rarely crowded and a great place to try Indian food. Wild Fin is expensive but always has good cocktails, beer and wine, and the appetizers make a great meal for cheaper. Their entrees are pricey but delicious. Teriyaki Bistro and Japan Ginger are both great teriyaki joints. Black Duck and Levitate Gastropub are both nice if you like the hipster, pub vibes, and they both have good cocktails and beer.

People might recommend Stans BBQ but just FYI I have been there twice and got food poisoning both times. Also, food wasn't great. If you want good BBQ, check out Jack's BBQ in South Seattle (they have other locations too but that's the only one I have been to).

Beware the speed cameras around town. By Issaquah High School sometimes the beacon won't be flashing and you'll still get a ticket, so pay attention to the times is says the area is a school zone. I think it's 20mph from 7am to 4pm, M-F, when school is in session.",t2_b6ealgm5,AnneNonnyMouse,0,1647818917.0,0,t1_i1grzww,i1grzww,True,pescatarrison,t3_ti99f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Issaquah/comments/ti99f7/tipsrecommendations_for_someone_new_to_issaquah/,Tips/Recommendations for Someone New To Issaquah?,/r/Issaquah/comments/ti99f7/tipsrecommendations_for_someone_new_to_issaquah/i1grzww/,3,r/Issaquah,0,3

"Bukhara has the best Indian, my fav that not everyone has is paneer pakoras. Bai Tong is excellent and imo has better ambiance than any of its other locations and i genuinely think the food is slightly better than the other lcoations. Legendary Donuts is amazing and you absolutely should try the Creme Brulee donut, which they have to make for you but its worth the added wait (and the sugar overdose). Their breakfast sandwiches are amazing too. The don't serve coffee, which is basically a sin, but there's a Starbucks in the same lot, so you can grab both in one car trip. Ohana is adorable, though I think the food is less good than the ambiance (which, their food is still pretty yummy, so not meant in a bad way, its just such a fun place to go). Cafe Rio is a whole experience. It's a chain from Utah I think? But their salads are awesome and it's just such a step up from Chipotle or Qdoba. Dickeys is also yummy but only if you get the spud and it's still a step down from Pecos Pit, if you're familiar, but it's close and still delicious as heck. Oh and. If you get breakfast out, issaquah Cafe is good but the wait is forever long buuuut you can join the waitlist online and hang out at home for an hour before going in. Their Monte Cristo is amazing and actually a proper Monte Cristo, not a French toast sandwich.

"No problem. I'm a nerd about utilities, dirt, roads, etc. and am always happy to share my nerdy knowledge. Civil Engineering is a very overlooked field because if we do our job right, you probably won't realize we exist.

Rest assured, the reason they're using that material for asphalt and concrete is because it's really good material that's very stable. It used to be a vertical cliff, so it's less steep than it used to be.

Eventually, like many quarries in the region, they'll stop the excavation activities and revert to just being an asphalt and concrete production area, so you'll still see material moved around but the overall topography along the hillside won't change.

"Hopefully this alleviates some of your concerns. I am a civil engineer that grew up in Issaquah  long before ""the Highlands"" existed, and even lived in the Highlands after it was developed. What you're calling a mine is actually a quarry. A lot of the work you see is aggregate sorting and cleaning, not active mining. While there is still a lot of earth being moved around and material being taken away for use in construction, it's probably less than you think. The soils/rock under the Issaquah Highlands are actually pretty sturdy. That quarry was there long before the plateau was cleared for development of the Highlands. There have been multiple earthquakes and heavy rain events in the quarry's existence. Over the years they have turned what was a cliff into a more gradual slope, likely at the recommendation geotechnical engineers/geologists. The City of Issaquah actually has special development standards for the ""quarry area"" that are akin to the type commonly applied around critical areas such as steep slopes and erosion prone areas. This means all buildings, structures, walls, etc. built in this zone require additional geotechnical investigation not typically required for those types of development.",t2_b6ealgm5,AnneNonnyMouse,0,1647145506.0,0,t1_i0gekcn,i0gekcn,True,tinymammothsnout,t3_tctp9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Issaquah/comments/tctp9r/whats_up_with_the_active_mine_in_issaquah/,What’s up with the active mine in Issaquah?,/r/Issaquah/comments/tctp9r/whats_up_with_the_active_mine_in_issaquah/i0gekcn/,26,r/Issaquah,0,26

"> I'd bet that the answer to this probably depends on how far from the highway you are on both sides, any highway transitions you need to make, and what exits you're getting on / off at.

This is the crux of the matter. There's a world of difference between some place like the Issaquah Highlands, and then a house five miles down Duthie in terms of commute time, but as a crow flies it's not very far. The arterial streets around here are slowly getting widened but there are definitely chokepoints. For a point of example, I was commuting from roughly the neighborhood of Duthie Hill Park to SoDo for a long time - On a good day where there were no traffic incidents, it would be 40 minutes leaving the plateau to arrive at 9. 20 minutes of that drive was getting to the freeway. Now I'm living on the Issaquah Highlands and I can zip straight onto 90, and it cuts that entire leg out of the journey.

*Without mentioning retailer Target directly, City Attorney Rachel Turpin said the intent of the ordinance is to protect the community from a business that allows “a haven for criminal activity.”  The City since October has been attempting to get the national retailer to address shoplifting, with little luck.  The proposed language would make it clear that allowing “outrageous criminal conduct to occur” without trying to intervene or prevent will not be tolerated, Turpin said.*

"I live very close to this Target store and visit 1-2 times per week . I also pass by frequently on my way to other places so I can see what's happening in the parking lot and on neighboring streets. This is really happening, it's awful, and  Target is absolutely at fault.

Almost every single time I have visited between October 2021 until now, I have witnessed shoppers wheeling cartloads of electronics, alcohol, and assorted items without paying. There is also a trail of Target shopping carts leading from the store parking lot to the  Issaquah Transit Center (located just half a mile from the Target).

People from all over the area are bussing in because they have heard about how lax this particular store is and they are clearing the shelves. They often have large suitcases in the cart, so when they push their carts back to the Issaquah Transit Center, they transfer their loot to the suitcases and then abandon their carts. You can see the trail of Target carts strewn everywhere and while driving at night I see people rolling bulging suitcases towards the bus station. I have been amazed at how long this has gone on for and wondered why no one was calling Target out on it.

Why do you think shoplifters are traveling all this way to this one Target and not to other Targets where they live? Targets are located everywhere, after all. The store manager at this Target refuses to take any safety precautions that might deter these crimes and the word has spread far and wide.

The steps the store is now required to take like hiring security guards/off-duty police officers, checking receipts at the front door, installing a cart security gatekeeper system, locking up alcohol, etc. are all things that other Targets have automatically done in other major cities I have lived in. Taking these security measures might cost more than just letting people steal, but Target has a responsibility here. It's a cost of doing business. I honestly think Target was ignoring the problem for so long because it was cheaper to do so.

But what about the cost to customers? On multiple occasions I have felt frightened inside the store. Outside the store, I have been picking up dinner from neighboring restaurants after work and encountered shoplifters rolling their suitcases through the parking lot towards the bus station. The city has likely gained a reputation for being a wonderful place to steal (private residences included) and that's bad for the people who live here.

If this continues, I would rather see this particular Target shutdown. It's very conveniently located but after what I have seen over the last few months I really don't think I'll shop there again. I also kind of wish I didn't live here anymore.",t2_529kx82d,PhaedrasMorning,0,1642393712.0,0,t1_hszywcl,hszywcl,True,Space_Queasy,t3_s423tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Issaquah/comments/s423tq/retailer_target_addressing_rampant_shoplifting/,Retailer Target Addressing Rampant Shoplifting After Warnings By the City of Issaquah,/r/Issaquah/comments/s423tq/retailer_target_addressing_rampant_shoplifting/hszywcl/,3,r/Issaquah,0,3

"Chopaka is a decent place. Not sure if they have availability right now or not, but generally there's at least a unit or two opening up.

Seems like good management, in my personal experience over the past year and a half. Also, while it's near the creek, it's not near enough that you should ever have to worry about flooding.

Not sure what they're asking right now due to rent increase bans last year that I think have expired now.

Worth checking on, though, depending on what area of Issaquah you prefer to live in. Not that I'm not aware of a bad part around here... just varying on walkable amenities.

"In spring/summer/fall, Cascade Bicycle Club might be a good way. You can join their free daily rides even if you're not a member. They post the times and locations (and pace/speed) on their website and you can just show up 15 minutes before the posted start time.

Many rides start in Redmond or Bellevue. Not many in Issaquah, although my wife used to lead a few rides around Lake Sammamish, starting in Issaquah. 

Obviously, this sucks in the winter, but there are still rides.

The advantages are:

* many times a week, posted on the Cascade website ([https://cascade.org/](https://cascade.org/))
* you can just show up, and then you spend an hour or 5 hours with some random people
* if you go enough times, eventually you run into the same people again

&#x200B;

If this doesn't appeal to you, here are some more ideas:

* Issaquah Alps trail club (hiking) - not sure how many events they have, right now their list looks empty (not posted yet for 2022?)  - I don't have any personal experience with this.
* Mountains To Sound Greenway has some events where people get together to remove invasive vegetation
* If this Covid thing ever ends, there used to be knitters meeting at the Starbucks on Gilman Blvd on Friday evenings

"Power came back here about an hour ago.  Was a rough night.  My Belgian Malinois, ""Butcher"", was antsy and couldn't sleep.  Did he sense something amiss???  IR cams are down!  Good thing my tattered dirty pajamas double as a ghillie suit.  Checked the suburban perimeter and all was clear.
  
Long-story-short, I didn't get much sleep as I was on pins and needles all night (either that, or I rolled over on my tactical knife strapped to my side).  Looking forward to a long nap now that the furnace is back on.  I'll be sleeping with one eye open and something that goes BOOM! nearby just in case.  If I learned anything from watching plenty of military dramas on TV it's that Charlie is pretty sneaky and could knock out the power again then STRIKE when you least expect it.

"My father volunteers at the hatchery to help with spawning so I've actually got some great info on this.  The count coming through the ballard locks and issaquah hatchery are actually higher this year than last year and a number of prior years.  This last week they had to do two days straight of spawning (they usually do one spawning day a week, or two days in a single week with a few days between to let the pens fill up again).  While it may seem low from only observing the river, the counts that the hatchery and other counters get up stream are quite encouraging.

"When you say ""work at"" - how long are we talking?

Even before Covid, margins for local coffee shops were really tight here. Hang out at a coffee shop or brewpub/do homework/work/use wifi/coffee shops in larger spaces were all a result of a very different economic time. We've felt it heavily here, but I think it's becoming true across the country, even the world. Like a lobster in a pot, it was slowly turning up so that few patrons noticed and owners were slowly bleeding, but Covid quickly turned the hurt to 11.

Even after reopening, indie coffee shops and restaurants are still really struggling (high rent, high wage, unsteady market, extra cleaning, insane coffee beans spikes/supply shortages/, etc). With the exception of big chains, a lot of smaller spots were already running losses when people would come to camp out - unless they bought multiple large drinks, tipped really well, and didn't stay more than a few hours/camped during dead hours. Because coffee shop camping was an accepted culture before property and wage increases, it's awkward for an owner or barista to tell a customer to spend more or time them out. 

I know people are desperate to work from a ""third-place"" when they've been stuck at home so long, but I wish there was more public acknowledgment that public-facing businesses aren't back to normal and that they can't meet our former expectations. I notice it all over the Seattle subs; ""Where are the fun things to do?"" ""Why aren't coffee shops open late?"" ""Why is X so expensive?"" We considered the cost of the coffee, maybe of service, but never the cost of space. Things have changed, but the average consumer doesn't seem to get it.

Forgive my rant, you asked a polite and fair question.

We also have great cultural diversity which is supported by community events such as the recent Juneteenth celebration to Lunar New Year and more. We also have diversity of incomes with a mix of rentals, low income housing, all the way to custom houses on Harrison Street. Neighbors really know each other, kids play in the alleys and walk to school together, adults host get togethers on their front porches in the evenings.

You might already know this, even though it's new, but I thought I'd let you know anyway!

I am so relieved. There was a young (looked like late teens) couple that would panhandle on the corner of the roundabout between Target and TJ's, and both times I saw them they were smoking or vaping - the nerve.

"It's affecting multiple school districts it seems.

Bellevue had this fight last week, eventually settled on a limited 2nd grade that will end shortly, and a show of K and 1st grade for a short time. 

The rest I suspect will be in the fall after the vaccine is distributed.

The teachers know there is risk and don't want Covid for what they get. Even in Chicago 80% of the staff just called in sick.

I personally did not expect school to happen until vaccines are distributed to them.

The kids most likely are a year out on the vaccine at least for now.

to be honest, with how often i'd used Discount Tire as a direct result of I-45, i've been using them up here too - i love costco, but the warranty and availability of Discount has generally overridden any slight discount i might end up with from Costco over the years..

make sure you get something that is Mud and Snow rated - I have yet to encounter any tire people up here that don't know that already, but if you're going to be judicious, it's something to validate..  also, make sure to pick yourself up a set of chains(real or cable,) as we have hills, or if you find yourselves up at one of the passes or even near, you may get into a 'chains required' situation..     is your CX-5 AWD?

"I have Verizon and it seems to work well.  I have been thinking of switching to T-Mobile but I know historically they have had service coverage  issues and I work all over the US.  Also, I used to travel internationaly and I was unsure about how well it works abroad. (obviously not a problem now).  

I know they recently merged with Sprint I would think that would only make things better.  I would imagine that since their corporate headquarters is about 4 miles away that it should be great around this area.

"Yes - try ""Jerzee's Barber Shop"" in Bellevue. I have stick straight, jet black Asian hair and Pon cut my hair for over a year there. Pon has sporadic hours, doesn't take appointments, and doesn't speak great English but she did a fantastic job cutting my hair and the other Asian guys I would see getting cut before me. I stumbled upon Jerzee's because my office was around the corner. 

I would not let anyone other than Pon or the owner cut your hair. The talent level varies greatly there... Good luck!

"I can understand that, hoping your apartment has other options.

Sadly for us we have no other options.

We have true unlimited (due to working at home), phone service we don't use, security (we don't use, but have the door buzzer things), and cable tv that noone seems to use (about 6 hours last month) for $249.

If we get them to drop those features it's 219 and we don't get unlimited (meaning $269 with unlimited upgrade).


It does however have 40mb up and 1gig down, which does keep up with a family of 8 (4 kids remote school, and 2 adults remote work).

So very pricey but works.

On the plus side the unlimited upgrade includes a free wifi mesh kit.",t2_9m4uq,cloverlief,0,1600477246.0,0,t1_g5rj296,g5rj296,False,chloecobryan,t3_ivfp5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Issaquah/comments/ivfp5f/my_husband_and_i_are_moving_to_issaquah_this/,My husband and I are moving to issaquah this month and we’re wondering what Internet provider is best to sign up for?,/r/Issaquah/comments/ivfp5f/my_husband_and_i_are_moving_to_issaquah_this/g5rj296/,1,r/Issaquah,0,1

"It really depends on where you are and what options they have.

A good chunk of the area has Comcast as the only usable choice, that being said unless there is a competing option prices can get quite high.

Eg. If you want 25mb down with 2ip you can get that for $40-60. 

If you want gigspeed you must accept a tv and phone bundle starting at $200/month.




If you live in a place with a fiber option, then comcast will be much cheaper and have better service.

DSL out here is a cruel joke for alternate options.
