"I don't believe that harvesting any kind of waterfowl is legal in Nebraska this time of year.

Getting medieval with a goose in your yard isn't as easy as it might sound. Animal control exists for a reason.

"Perhaps you just don't drive enough.  I KNOW that things have improved a bunch, overall.

Perhaps you don't see it in your particular case, but the green light project made a big difference.

As far as potholes, well, the pothole filling machine is far from an ideal solution, but it does OK.  Better than a hole, that gets chewed bigger by every car that drives through it.  Have you ever lived in a city that has honest-to-God really bad roads?  Go try Detroit, then come back and tell me how bad it is here.

Speeding is your choice.  If you don't want a ticket, don't speed, and officer Denny won't bother you.

Oh, and as far as getting your car moving again, if you start out slower, drive at just under the speed limit, and stop getting frustrated by Grandma in her '99 Buick, Lincoln is a really nice place to drive, and you won't have to stop nearly as often, which eliminates the need to get moving again.  And you'll find you get home about 53 seconds later than you do if you drive as it sounds like you do currently.  Plus your stress/frustration levels drop markedly, and are replaced by amusement if you just relax and watch the morons stomp the gas when the light turns green and stomp the brake at the next light, because it hasn't turned green yet.  And you go sailing sedately by them, as they accelerate madly to keep you behind them, so they can stop at the next light.

We have Allo at work for internet and phone and it is literally the most reliable utility we've ever had. I moved our church to Allo a few years ago too for internet and phone. It has been rock solid for them too. They had the problem of old wiring coming into the building and both Windstream and Spectrum wanted to charge an insane amount to get new service to the building. Knowing Allo didn't charge for installs, I urged our pastors to go for it. Way better service compared to the slow DSL they had, and saves them about 50% from what Windstream charged too.

"I never had any issues with their actual service. I just didn’t like that you had to sign up for promotional stuff every year to keep the cost reasonable and I’d have to talk to multiple people about it because inevitably the first person I’d talk to would tell me it was a new customer promotion only. Then you’d have to buy the bundle and I didn’t want a landline. When I eventually moved I had a lot of issues getting everything set up and had to make multiple hour plus phone calls before they’d send someone out to fix it. The last straw was some lady calling me at work. I answered it because they touted it through the local number so I thought maybe there was something wrong but it was just a marketing call. When I told her I was at work and couldn’t talk she still went through her spiel and asked if I wanted to sign up for some streaming service. I said not really but she could send me the email and I’d look at it. Cut to my bill being huge and I was already in a bad mood that day and then had to sit on hold in 17° and wind for way too long so I was pretty angry and just said cancel it when I got through finally.

"Yes, science progresses by considering new information to update assumptions, test theories, and change consensus. Remember when homosexuality was considered a mental illness? That consensus changed  in 1973, by the way. I’m glad you support homosexuals, at least you accept that medical knowledge. The key here is that medical consensus shouldn’t change because of political pressure or someone’s gut feeling. In fact, the current trend in psychology is moving towards more acceptance of non-gender conforming individuals. You just don’t like it because of your prejudices. 

Any time people like you attack marginalized communities by pretending a component of their humanity is a disease, you end up on the wrong side of history. It’s happened with Black people and is STILL being dismantled today. A not insignificant percentage of medical professionals today still believe that Black people don’t feel pain as much as others and that they inherently have a lower IQ. Sounds absurd today, doesn’t it? It’s happened with homosexuality as referenced above and countless other marginalized communities through human history. 

I sincerely hope you live long enough to realize how hateful you are being. It’s just as likely that you dig your heels in and end up as that mean transphobic uncle at Thanksgiving that none of your nieces or nephews want to talk to.

"People resort to screaming when marginalized people have their rights taken away. People resort to screaming when they are shoved out of societal and political discourse. People begin screaming when people like you tell them they shouldn’t exist, but offer nothing but “if we don’t talk about it’s it will go away.”

By the way, throwing pedophilia into the mix reeks of desperation. No one is talking about having sex with children here 

Also, actually pull up the DSM-5, the framework for mental health treatment in the US. 

“The DSM–5 articulates explicitly that “gender non-conformity is not in itself a mental disorder.” The 5th edition also includes a separate “gender dysphoria in children” diagnosis and for the first time allows the diagnosis to be given to individuals with disorders of sex development (DSD). DSM–5 also includes the optional “post-transition” specifier to indicate when a particular individual’s gender transition is complete. In this “post-transition” case, the diagnosis of gender dysphoria would no longer apply but the individual may still need ongoing medical care (e.g., hormonal treatment). Nevertheless, discussions continue among advocates and medical professionals about how best to preserve access to gender transition-related health care while also minimizing the degree to which such diagnostic categories stigmatize the very people that physicians are attempting to help.”

">and I’m sure that senate quote you stated refers to the part in which sexual orientation and gender identity are prohibited from being taught at certain grade levels. Which that final part how is that not completely reasonable? It is no different than the CRT issue. There’s no reason whether it’s taught or not it shouldn’t be discussed till an upper class man high school class.

You are remarkably full of shit. How is that not completely reasonable? Because children in those grade levels often wrestle with their own identities and orientations. Not allowing that to be discussed or making it taboo will only further alienate children who are already struggling with the mismatch between the clothes their parents put on them and how they feel  inside. Or the mismatch between grandpa asking his 1st grade grandson if he has a girlfriend yet, but the grandson actually has a crush on Timmy. Not allowing it to be discussed makes them feel like they're a freak, they're an outlier, and there's something wrong with them.

Why the fuck do you think that these discussions need to wait until high school? Do you think kids don't realize their own sexuality until they're 16? Do you think kids are oblivious to the changes in their body, how they feel, how they identify, and how they want to present? They aren't. They struggle every day because *people like you* don't think they should exist, or at least they shouldn't exist until late high school... for some inexplicable reason.

If you want to really dig into it, heterosexuality and the binary male/female gender construct are constantly forced upon kids. Where's the outrage? Boy and girl kissing on TV? Cool. Boy and boy kissing? ThE gAy AgEnDa Is CoMiNg FoR mY kIdS!

>Young children are meant to learn the foundations of education not complex social and personal identity issues that can be swayed in either political direction by teachers.

Oh, is that why all of the anti-lockdown assholes were constantly complaining about how under-socialized kids were because of remote learning and how much it was going to set back an entire generation? Education, especially early education, is far more than simply learning the ""foundations of education,"" whatever the fuck that means. They learn social norms. They learn how to interact with other human beings in a socially acceptable manner. They learn how to become valuable members of society.

**Part of being a valuable member of society is understanding yourself and how you fit into society.** Prohibiting them from being represented in education, or even stopping them from talking to a trusted educator about how they feel only teaches them that they don't have a place in society.

"First off let's talk about what you have linked. Your first link is specifically focused on business tax rates. Texas does fine at this. No argument from me. Tax rates are even good at the individual level on goods and services (Texas 8% per your link is ranked 3rd lowest)


Your second link shows the cost of living of each state. Good! Texas, Florida, and Nebraska all have low costs of living. This doesn't provide any actual context to the conversation other than prove that my tax rankings should decrease bases on the CoLi that I provided. Thank you for double checking me.


On a micro scale the tax rates you provided are fine and appealing, but I am looking at this on more of a macro level with many more factors including property taxes, home values, excise taxes, and wage data based on the median state household, respectfully.

Not a controlled burn. Though maybe it could have started out that way. A couple weeks back my house almost burned down because the city said we could burn stuff. We had a permit. Ended up burning most of our land and a lot of stuff the landlord had including quite a few cars.

"Peter Coyote narrator voice: The answer to that question would come in the form of a border wall. An intense fear mongering campaign took place and people everywhere demanded that the nanny state do something. To placate the masses, the state embarked on a journey that would include financial institutions controlled by local politicians and additional fear campaigns to convince citizens a  tax was needed to pay for the wall. Willfully ignorant chimps ate that shit up with a spoon because they wanted to get every drop.

Although there was no evidence to support the effectiveness of the wall, citizens took to the internet in numbers and demanded that the nanny state shut up and take their money.

In the end, despite the wall having been built, the smoke continued to flow over the wall and into the state. So once again financially motivated entities let loose yet another campaign. One that would place the blame for the smoke on those that had voted against the wall in the first place. The plan worked and the elites continued to profit.",t2_6hc4aw0q,RedRube1,0,1648651919.0,0,t1_i2pzdo8,i2pzdo8,False,fishmanblac,t3_trvhur,https://www.reddit.com/r/lincoln/comments/trvhur/whats_burning_downtown/,what's burning downtown?,/r/lincoln/comments/trvhur/whats_burning_downtown/i2pzdo8/,7,r/lincoln,0,7

i worked at a mom and pop shop as just a receptionist then i switched to a bather and the groomers let me groom some of their dogs but doing that i got a lot less pay than i get now but it really did introduce me into the world of it and how much work goes into the dogs so i don’t regret doing that but my starting pay at petsmart was $1.50 more than my pay after my raise at the mom and pop shop. personally my academy was about 15 mins away from my home store but two of my coworkers went out of state (driving distance) for academy. they paid for the gas needed and the hotel stay. i did hands on training for two weeks but they just switched it a couple weeks ago to three weeks of hands on and one week of book work. before this wave of grooming hands on training was a month but i think cause of covid they changed it. i did not look into petco since i knew people who worked at my home store i just got a recommendation and started working here. one of our new hires came from petco and he said they were messing around about sending him to academy so i guess it takes longer to get there at petco but i’m not sure. when i started they didn’t want to send me to academy because of covid i think the delta strain had just hit so i had to wait six months. but the new hire also said they didn’t do sanitary trims as bathers which i don’t like since that really helps getting you comfortable with the clippers but i also have a coworker who just left here to go to petco and she said she does sanis so i’m not sure if it was just and issue with him doing them or an actual policy,t2_gis98nt5,Queasy_Ask_6814,0,1648642805.0,0,t1_i2pfgpd,i2pfgpd,False,Animal_Foreign,t3_qlz28x,https://www.reddit.com/r/lincoln/comments/qlz28x/petsmart_grooming_salon/,Petsmart Grooming Salon,/r/lincoln/comments/qlz28x/petsmart_grooming_salon/i2pfgpd/,1,r/lincoln,0,1

"Thank you so much for replying!  Honestly, and it's a long story, but it would be my first time working at an actual place of business (corporate or not) and truthfully I don't know if I can handle it.  I might find it incredibly overwhelming at first because I worked from home for the past 8 years.  Would you recommend getting a job at a groomer first before taking the plunge at petsmart?  I've even seen somewhere on a different post that someone worked as a kennel attendant at a vet hospital and got to learn quite a bit from the groomer there.  Another thing I was curious about is was your academy far away from your home petsmart?  If so, do they really cover staying at a hotel?  Is training for a month or 2 weeks?

if you can tolerate working for a cooperation i would do it. i wish i was able to find a small business that would take me on but petsmart is a good place to start but i finished school recently along with two other people. one of them quit grooming and the other i’ll never recommend. i don’t like how they try and get you to do more dogs esp people that aren’t ready for that. my grooming training was pretty short but i had prior experience so it didn’t bother me but i can’t imagine the training being enough for someone completely new to it. i think training depends on who you get for it cause i really did not like the guy who trained me and basically did everything on my own with what i learned elsewhere. after school you’ll get more training from your salon manager but i really didn’t need that so i’m basically on my own now. the other people who graduated recently were under him heavily until they felt fully comfortable being on their own which is nice. petsmart really just varies store to store so i think as long as you get along with your salon manager you’ll have a good experience. when you get back from academy you’ll still be hourly but after i think 200 dogs you’ll make 40% then 6months after the 40% you’ll make 50%,t2_gis98nt5,Queasy_Ask_6814,0,1648635981.0,0,t1_i2p4xej,i2p4xej,False,Animal_Foreign,t3_qlz28x,https://www.reddit.com/r/lincoln/comments/qlz28x/petsmart_grooming_salon/,Petsmart Grooming Salon,/r/lincoln/comments/qlz28x/petsmart_grooming_salon/i2p4xej/,1,r/lincoln,0,1

"When I was a freshman in high school (about 6-7 years ago) our teacher made us write a one page paper on a Lincoln man who worked closely with Roosevelt. We were given only one source and it was expected to be done by the end of class. Right away I noticed that some of the information was a little weird and outdated and that the URL had my teachers name in it, so I decided to do further research and I could not find any information about the man in the article, he simply did not exist. I tried reverse searching the images on the website, I tried looking up people who had worked with Roosevelt, I looked up everything but I found no information about a man from Lincoln who had worked with Roosevelt. All I found was an obituary of a man with the same name who was lived and died in Lincoln but it did not line up with the time Roosevelt would have been in office and there was no other information of that man that I could find.

By the end of class I had turned in my paper, but I wrote about all of the evidence that pointed to this man never existing, instead of what was assigned to us. The teacher had overheard me joking with my friends around me that this guy didn’t exist and that we were wasting our time, and at the end of class he revealed the truth to all of us. The story of the Lincoln man was made up and the guy that I found was actually his grandpa. He told our class that he had been giving his students this assignment for over 10 years and that I was the first one to figure out the truth, no one had ever come close. I was genuinely shocked no one else had ever thought to do a simple google search on this man, especially since there was so little information on the website to begin with .

"My wife and I enjoy going to the Delray Ballroom in the Haymarket on their social dance nights on occasion. There is a short dance lesson before that they rotate styles on. Definitely more one on one ballroom type dancing, ranging all over from waltz, latin, country, chacha and swing.  Single friendly, so long as don't mind asking another to dance on the floor.

There is a Contra dancing group Lincoln is also fun once a month. They used to have it at the Auld center, but think they moved post-covid era.  This is definitely more of a group dance than one on one. Bring your tennis shoes for this one, lots of moving!  This is very single friendly, no date required.

Plamor has different dance nights as well on their site.  I enjoyed this more bringing my wife to dance with, vs when I was single and going solo - so not as solo fun.

While not Lincoln, the Jitterbugs group in Omaha is great fun every week, and have a swing dance lesson before the main floor is opened. Definitely fun with a date, or going solo is great too as the crowd always seems to be and flow with pickup dancing.",t2_jdvlgo0k,ZPlexor,0,1648312894.0,0,t1_i27juzs,i27juzs,True,mycatisanorange,t3_tmqxuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/lincoln/comments/tmqxuo/does_lincoln_have_any_arcade_bars_also_best/,"Does Lincoln have any arcade bars, also best places to dance on the floor with your friends?",/r/lincoln/comments/tmqxuo/does_lincoln_have_any_arcade_bars_also_best/i27juzs/,3,r/lincoln,0,3
