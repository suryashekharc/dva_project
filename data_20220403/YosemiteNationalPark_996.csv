"Real Talk: upper falls is really rough for those with poor fitness. 4.5 hours just going up (if they make it). Then there are the crazy trail runners who go gate to gate in 52 minutes. Your experience will be somewhere in the middle. My advise is gauge when you want to be down, rather than up. Count on 3/4 the amount of time coming down. (3 hours up, \~2-2.5hr down, plus snack time and pictures and enjoy the view for an hour up there, about 6hr total is a good guess.) Take into account that direct sunlight hits those top switchbacks from 9-4ish. Sunscreen. Use it.  


Noon start will get you down by 6 or 7, still light out, and you can walk across the street to the bar at the lodge and drink the 4000 calories you just burned in beer. At this time the trail will be very warm (direct sun) and probably crowded. Makes it kind of a drag, IMMHO.  


7am start I like more because cooler start means your body warms up to good operating temperature, hit the falls by 10 when everything starts properly warming up and you can take a nice nap on a rock by a river in a forest above a waterfall. Less crowds at that time too. Count on being down by 2-3 because spending a couple hours up there just enjoying where you are is nice. (pro tip: turn your cellphone off.

"When you go to Yosemite. Have tunnel view be your first impression. It’s the road that leads from the south east. Fucking mindblowing!
Spend some time at tunnel view. Make your way down into the valley. You’ll see bridal veil fall to your right. Easy walk to see that waterfall. After continue driving and you’ll see a pull off for sentinel picnic area and cathedral picnic area. Great views of el cap from both and it’s such amazing spots to soak in the spirit of the valley. Don’t miss that.

After I recommend driving to see Yosemite falls. You’ll get views of half dome from here. Have your first day be more relaxing and soaking In the valley. So much to see and soak in with the spots on mentioned. Following day 100% due mist trail to vernal and Nevada falls. It’s my favorite hike. 
Might be worth getting a poncho as it can get pretty wet lol. 
I recommend starting that hike the second day because parking can sometimes be tricky over there so it’s best to start earlier. 
Mirror lake is another beautiful trail.  

Have fun!! That place is insane.

"**Half Dome**: Arguably, the best view in Yosemite (of Half Dome and much of Yosemite) is from Glacier Point. In fact, it might be my favorite vista in the entire world. The road to Glacier Point is closed, but you should be able to hike to the top. It is a tough hike if you're not in shape. Unfortunately, Four Mile Trail is currently closed.

[https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/fourmiletrail.htm](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/fourmiletrail.htm)

Best option: So, with both Glacier Point Road and Four Mile Trail closed, your best bet would be an ALL-DAY hike starting at the ""Yosemite Valley Trailhead Parking"" parking lot (near Happy Isles) up the Mist Trail (or John Muir Trail) and then to the Panorama Trail up to Glacier Point.

This is an amazing and breathtaking hike (literally and figuratively). However, it's difficult and would take about eight hours. You would climb next to two giant waterfalls (Vernal and Nevada falls) along the Mist Trail before cutting across the top of Nevada Falls toward Glacier Point.

[https://www.yosemite.com/what-to-do/panorama-trail/](https://www.yosemite.com/what-to-do/panorama-trail/)

**El Capitan**: There are some great views of El Capitan from the Yosemite Valley. My favorite view is from Tunnel View in the mid-to-late afternoon (when the sun is shining westward onto the Yosemite Valley).

Personally, I find El Capitan best viewed from the Yosemite Valley floor. Half Dome, on the other hand, is best viewed from elevation (with Glacier Point the best view if you're not hiking up to Half Dome and climbing the cables to the top).

Let me know if you have any questions.

**\*EDIT** \- As a couple of others pointed out, the paved road to Glacier Point (i.e., Glacier Point Road) will continue to be closed for 2022. So, you don't need to call and ask.

The hike option to Glacier Point is still a great option for an amazing scenic hike with arguably some of the best views.",t2_y8lda,chrismireya,0,1648878070.0,0,t1_i32te93,i32te93,True,BASED_BAS,t3_tua37e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tua37e/first_time_hike_in_yosemite_advice_april_10th/,"First time hike in Yosemite advice, April 10th",/r/Yosemite/comments/tua37e/first_time_hike_in_yosemite_advice_april_10th/i32te93/,1,r/Yosemite,0,1

"UPDATE:
We went up Half Dome last Friday with out any problems. We ended up just buying the gear because the hike seemed awesome and it was well worth it. The cables looked pretty steep but with shoes with a good grip that wasn’t a problem. For safety we used two ropes with pursiks. We saw two people coming down when we went up and a bunch of people were making their way up when we went down again. No one used a pursik, just carabiners. I highly recommend to use a Pursik tho, since there is one pretty long part where you would Fall a good bit if you slipped. Better be safe then sorry. 
The hardest part was getting up and down sub dome because it was still covered in snow and pretty slippery, especially going down when the sun melted the top part. 

We left at 6 am which gave us plenty of time to return in daylight and gave us about one hour on half dome with out anyone around. Highly recommend to do this. Just do research on how to use a Pursik, have shoes with good grip and be smart and not reckless.
Can’t really understand why people are saying we shouldn’t do this because I use different terminology. The rope we bought to use was literally called ‚lifeline‘.

Theres a few more areas to live, if you plan on staying a while, you can choose a place, otherwise you'll likely end up in Huff. The Valley is bigger than the little villages in Yellowstone. Working in Yosemite is a little different than Yellowstone in my experience. People in Yos aren't as insane, and there's more people who enjoy outdoorsy stuff

There is alao Wawona and Toulemne. I'm not sure honestly why anyone would wanna live in Wawona, but some people seem to like it. Toulemne is cool because it's smaller, quieter, higher elevation so it's drastically cooler, and you don't get all the crowds from the Valley.

A really nice/popular campsite (i.e., will be impacted and will have fire rings) is a little bit after Yosemite Point: when you are done climbing (and before you start going back down), there will be a wide and flat area (to your left) in the forest.

"Nearly every hike out of the Valley is strenuous. But the Valley itself is flat, very flat. And it's gorgeous and amazing in a way that simply can't be captured in photos. The stunning rock is so very close and vertical even when it's a mile away it's presence is palpable.

People seem to like walking the Merced River and Mirror Lake among the very easy hikes. You should limit driving around; it's a distracting and unpleasant place to be the driver with big views passing you by and while parking isn't summer-awful in April, it's almost never really convenient.",t2_1tcyq43i,UtahBrian,0,1648731375.0,0,t1_i2ubeb2,i2ubeb2,True,busted_tooth,t3_tsa1z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tsa1z5/walks_views_for_elderly_parents/,Walks & Views for elderly parents?,/r/Yosemite/comments/tsa1z5/walks_views_for_elderly_parents/i2ubeb2/,1,r/Yosemite,0,1
"First, you should probably postpone the trip, it’s not easy to plan in a couple weeks if you’re new. 

1. read about the trails, pick what you want to see, be realistic about what you can hike and miles per day. All Trails is helpful for distance and elevation. Pick a back up route too. I went in Sept and my first trail pick was booked. Get on the wilderness pass site and see what starting options you have. You basically just pick a starting point, you have to tell them the planned hike/camp, # of people and days. Just do the research ahead of time, then see #5

2. read about where you can actually disperse camp, read about the backpackers camp grounds in the valley and in little Yosemite valley (https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/lyv.htm) if that’s a point of interest. There may be others, but those were the ones I used or knew about. Pay attention to where the water sources are. Pick camps based on the water sources, much easier. Also read the rules on how far away you need to camp from the water and how far away you should be from the trail. https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/upload/wildernesstrailheads.pdf 

3. research hotel/overnight accommodations, it’s nice to start and end the trip with a roof over your head 

4. You do not need crazy fancy gear. Don’t drop hundreds of dollars at REI. Get on YouTube, look up ultralight backpackers or something similar and they have great, mostly no-bullshit tips. I like Kyle Hates Hiking. https://youtu.be/1NIoX4fJeqg
Or Homemade Wanderlust - she has gears lists in most of her descriptions, a little pricier gear but great for how much clothing to bring (you don’t need much…you’re going to get dirty anyway)
*you do need a bear container for food - get that at REI. The ones you can rent at the park look heavy AF

5. Wilderness permit - once you’ve done your research, know your route and have a back up route, general plan for other accommodations…As early as possible, apply online for the wilderness pass. I don’t know how it works in the spring, but I applied for mine like 3-4 weeks ahead of time for Sept. I submitted 2 apps (one under my name, one from my bf) to ensure we got at least one of the trailheads we wanted for our starting point. We were applying for a half dome permit, which is part of the wilderness permit app, and the HD permits are more limited


My first trip:
Day 1 - arrived in the valley, stayed and parked at Curry Village Cabins. Explored around the valley 

Day 2 - drove to and parked at Glacier Point (it’s close on the map, but a 40mins drive), hiked south down the Illilouette Creek/valley, camped passed where the Mono Meadow trail comes in and crossed the creek - that was a specific stipulation for that area. 5-6 mile hike. (starting a Glazier doesn’t seem to be an option on the trailhead map - looks closed for 2022)

Day 3 - hiked north up the other side of Illilouette towards little Yosemite valley. Camped at LYV backpackers camp. Maybe another 5-7 miles with exploring a little 

Day 4 - left gear at LYV camp, hiked up, did half dome and back early AF. 4ish miles. Rested, packed up, Then did 10ish miles I think, back down LYV and across Panorama trail back up to Glacier Point (that part was a bitch to finish out on) hindsight, we would have done one more day out camping and just backtracked the way we came for a more leisurely route. 
Stayed the night at Yosemite Valley Lodge

Day 5 - biked around the valley for the day and headed out ✌🏼

This route was ‘wilderness’, but not no one is ever going to find us, wilderness. I’m fairly new to backpacking and this felt safe and reasonable. We got that alone in the wild bit through Illilouette, but everything in LYV is pretty populated because of Half Dome. I can’t speak to trails farther out.

"Congratulations on your upcoming visit to Yosemite! 

Apart days with heavy snowfall, I can't think of any reason to need a 4x4. I live in the Bay Area and I've visited the park countless times in my Ford Escape (2wd). I've seen plenty of hybrids at the park too (even during snowy days). As you're going in June, this won't be an issue. 

Outside the park? I can't really say as I don't know the roads you're planning to traverse. I've never gone off-roading around Yosemite. I've gone off-roading elsewhere (e.g., Sedona, mountains in Mexico, beaches, etc.), but it's pretty clear when you need a 4x4 and/or higher clearance.

"There are four main entrances to Yosemite.

Two from the West; one from the South; one from the East.

Highway 120 from the east starts near Mono Lake/Highway 395 and (when open in the summer) routes you through the Yosemite High Country/Tuolomne Meadows before you reach the Crane Flat area and can drop down into the Yosemite Valley near Bridalveil Falls.  This park entrance from the east is closed all winter.  You can't use it until they plow and inspect/repair 120 in spring.

Highway 120 from the west will periodically close with each snowfall, eventually opening up after it gets plowed (takes anywhere from hours/days).  However, access into the high country is closed all winter; this route just gets you into the Yosemite Valley during winter and is cut off from the (closed-for-the-winter) eastern entrance from Mono Lake.

Highways 140 (the more reliable of the Western entrances, as it mostly keeps low elevation along the Merced River) and 41 (southern entrance) are regularly plowed and will close briefly due to snow but open pretty quickly.  Highway 140 has a tendency to experience landslides - these are rare, but when they do occur they take a whole lot longer to clear than the snowstorms that close down 41.",t2_2s3b0707,BlueVerdigris,0,1648618222.0,0,t1_i2oj7y9,i2oj7y9,True,No-Ambition1256,t3_trq01x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/trq01x/is_the_road_into_yosemite_open_on_maps_it_says/,Is the road into Yosemite open?

"There are some great comments here if you are looking to backpack. 

As for Camping: If you want to car camp in the valley and then do half dome in a day, try to get a campsite at one of the campgrounds in the valley (Upper Pines or Camp 4 is your best bet, but Camp 4 is a couple miles from the mist trail, and Upper Pines is right next to the mist trail trailhead). Camp 4 is first come first serve and is hard to get a spot in the summer, so see if you can get a canceled campsite at Upper Pines with [Campflare](https://campflare.com).  The site will text you when someone cancels their campground reservation so you can book it. 

As for half dome permits: There is a daily lottery, the average success rate on weekdays was 47%, but only 24% on weekends. See more [here](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdpermits.htm).

"Hey, I just did the opposite move! Five years in Yosemite and just moved to Bellingham this January. Get ready for the heat and dry dry dry air.

Anyways to answer some of your questions:
- Most people I know get groceries in Oakhurst every two weeks or so. In the summer when Tioga is open I would just go to the East Side every weekend so I’d get groceries in Mammoth. You can supplement those trips with foods from the Valley store in a pinch but it’s expensive. 
- Bring a cooler to the store since it’s so far away. 
- Are you in NPS or Aramark housing? NPS Valley housing is decent but older and I cannot stress the importance of keeping your kitchen clean and keeping your pantry mice-proof enough. I’ve only seen the tent cabins for Aramark housing, which are just what they sound like.  
- Other things that are hard to get used to: lack of amenities and healthcare. A trip to the dentist is a whole day trip to the city. If your car breaks down, it’s a big deal. (I recommend getting AAA with a large tow radius if you have an older or less reliable vehicle.) Generally just doing errands can be difficult. 
- One thing that’s different from most “real” jobs and towns is that your friends are all your coworkers. There’s not really a way to maintain a boundary between your social life and your professional life. If you’re not friends with your coworkers, you don’t have friends, because that’s all there is. This was probably the hardest adjustment for me...it’s a small town and rumors get around. Everyone knows everyone.
- That being said it’s truly super social and most people are kind. There’s lots of events. Someone is always having a party or a potluck. Head to a Sal’s night in El Portal on a night with live music.
-  If you like eating out, there’s some decent food on the East Side, but most of the options in the Valley, Oakhurst, or Mariposa are really bland and underwhelming. 
- There’s lots of cool people doing lots of cool jobs. Generally just keep an open mind and talk to everyone because they’re all doing some cool shit.",t2_gmtom,bendtowardsthesun,0,1648572705.0,0,t1_i2l2nvq,i2l2nvq,False,beantalian,t3_tnecgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tnecgl/moving_to_the_valley_in_april_for_a_year_round/,Moving to the Valley in April for a Year Round position.

Happy Isles to Little Yosemite Valley

Happy Isles past LYV (Donohue pass eligible)

Rafferty Creek to Vogelsang

"If you can get it, the best (and probably cheapest) way is a wilderness permit from Happy Isles to Little Yosemite Valley. That permit includes the permit to summit Half Dome. You also don't need a bear can if only going to LYV (verified on a trip last year) which is another plus.

With that permit, you are entitled to spend the night before you trip + a night at the end in the  backpacker's campground - it will be crowded but everybody seems to find a spot.

If you don't already have the permit then you need to check for cancellations or take the chance on a walk-up.

There's also a lottery/permit for just a day trip to summit Half Dome. It may also be possible. However, you'd have to spend more on lodging at that point. If in decent shape and determined, it's do-able as a day trip - I just prefer to get the night in LYV if possible.

"It takes about 90 minutes from the Valley to the Cathedral Lakes TH. The backpacker’s campground in the Valley is kind of hidden at the back of the North Pines Campground. There is a small temporary parking lot at the back of North Pines where you can unload gear and walk it across the footbridge to the backpacker’s campground. You can pick a site and then set up camp. If all of the sites are taken you just need to share a site with someone. Sharing a site is more likely on a Friday or Saturday night. There is usually a park service intern who works there and will check you in. If they are not around you can pay your camping fee and insert it in the fee box. There is an info board with instructions for the campground. You need to have one person in your group take your vehicle and park it at the Curry Village Lot and then walk or ride the shuttle back to North Pines. The back side of the Cathedral Lakes are the best place to camp because it takes a few minutes to walk around to that area. A lot of people tend to try to camp right where the trail ends at the lakes. Upper Cathedral gets fewer people, both backpackers and hikers, because it is farther and higher from the trailhead than Lower.",t2_cgfhmba,hikeraz,0,1648505377.0,0,t1_i2hqkji,i2hqkji,True,ag2575,t3_tqk8ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tqk8ue/cathedral_lakes_in_september/,Cathedral lakes in September,/r/Yosemite/comments/tqk8ue/cathedral_lakes_in_september/i2hqkji/,8,r/Yosemite,0,8

"The biggest reason is avalanche risk. Long sections of that roadway skirt the bottoms of various domes and treeless slopes that do not hold snow well. When you try to clear away the snow on the road, upslope snow simply slides down into the newly created gap. Polly Dome, at Tenaya Lake, is a great example of what I'm talking about. The dome doesn't hold snow, and the road is right at the base of the dome. I've been told that accumulated snow can be more than 50 feet deep there during heavy winters as snow slides down from above. 

That's a problem that can be overcome, but the park service has no interest in doing so. The Tioga Road is maintained so that park visitors can access that section of the park. When the high country is buried under deep snow and isn't accessible anyway, there simply isn't any reason for them to improve the access roads. The park isn't going to invest in sheltering the roads simply to give trans-Sierra traffic another route across the mountains. 

FWIW, there have been occasional discussions about upgrading Highway 108 to turn it into a year round highway. That one would be a lot less challenging, and would be more politically and socially acceptable to most people. 108 is the route that many already take in the summer when Tioga is inaccessible due to conditions or reservation requirements.",t2_jigwr,codefyre,0,1648424327.0,0,t1_i2dh42j,i2dh42j,True,Glacier_Peak,t3_tpujvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tpujvt/why_does_tioga_pass_close/,Why does Tioga Pass close?,/r/Yosemite/comments/tpujvt/why_does_tioga_pass_close/i2dh42j/,12,r/Yosemite,0,12

"Tioga pass is the highest pass over the sierra at 10k feet. When it snows, it comes down *hard*. Usually multiple feet. Avalanches are common, along with rockfalls, and fallen trees.

It's way more effective to let much of the snow melt naturally, so crews can spot rockfalls and fallen trees and clear those before they ruin snow clearing equipment.

"If you're into steam trains or are a movie buff it's definitely worth a stop. It's small, but the park itself is mostly built around the roundhouse and repair shops. You can actually take tours through the shop and get up close with steam engines that are currently being restored. It's a pretty unique experience. Not something I'd make a long trip to see, but it's a great way to burn a couple of hours if you're in the area. 

If you're a movie history buff, the park has a long history with Hollywood too, and it's trains have been in hundreds of movies and TV shows. Back to the Future, Unforgiven, Petticoat Junction.

Once we got to the valley the sky had cleared up and it was all views like the one I posted. Even some of the falls were flowing even though they usually don’t around that time of year.

"If you're into old ""ghost towns"", Columbia State Park is only about 30 minutes little off route. It's a pretty cool place to visit, but there's  a LOT to see and it can easily eat an entire day. Still, stagecoach rides, gold panning, tours through tons of awesome old buildings. It's always a stop I'll recommend if you have the time.

If you like old trains (or the Back to the Future movies) and want something a little quicker, Railtown 1897 State Park in Jamestown is only about 15 minutes off-route if you're taking highway 120, and the entire park can be toured in 90 minutes (a bit longer if you want to ride on the train). The park is basically an old train roundhouse full of steam engines and passenger cars. They have several old steam engines, including the train from the Back to the Future movies, along with a handful of props from the movies filming. If you actually want to ride the train, buy your tickets online ahead of time because they do sell out.

Vernal falls, probably will get up to Nevada if it's not too icy since we are not bringing anything for traction

Might go up yosemite falls a bit past Columbia point or w.e where you can see the upper falls view

I would go up 4 mile but the gate is probably closed, I gotta check. If I was solo I might go past vernal along the panoramic trail, but I'd check how the trail is up there first

"I’d definitely choose Mist Trail over Yosemite Falls. I think it has far better views/scenery. Mariposa grove will also take much longer than you think. You’ll have to add a legit 4 mile hike (2 miles there and back) just to get to the grove trailheads. Then you’ll have to go at least a mile or so to get to the Grizzly Giant, which is the closest best attraction. The area is spread out with tons of individual groves around multiple trails/loops. I think it would be really hard to do Mariposa>Mist Trail/other hike>tunnel view in time for sunset, especially due to all of the driving. I would recommend staying in the valley for the day—hiking in the morning, then enjoying the valley, then sunset.

"If you are limited for time, you might want to look at a map and reconsider the order of this. You're backtracking a lot depending on where you are coming in from. Tunnel View to the Grove is about 45 min driving each way, so you'll be burning a lot of time driving to come almost all the way back to the Valley for Tunnel View last. 

Also consider that the Mariposa Grove shuttle will not be running until early June, so it is a 4 mile round trip hike just from the parking lot to the entrance of the Grove. Probably doing a longer hike in the Valley plus driving to the Grove and hiking is pushing daylight unless you start very early. 

Personally I would do Mist Trail all the way to Nevada Falls over Upper Yosemite, but it depends what you're looking for.

As for views, hard to say, it’s been years since I’ve been up Mist and JMT but it was very cool.

"You will need a day pass permit to enter the park from 5/20 to 9/30. You don't need one to enter in April.

Highway 120 is a mountain pass that closes for the winter. It is incredibly unlikely to be open in April, so this will be a long detour for you around the Sierras. Also, Glacier Pt Rd is closed for winter and then construction in case you had memories of any specific hikes off that road. You can get there from the Valley via 4 Mile Trail, but that is also currently closed for winter/trail maintenance. It might open up by the time you visit. When you visit in April, plan to be limited to hikes from the Valley, Wawona, and Hetch Hetchy areas.

Tioga Rd being closed doesn't really impact the rest of the park in winter from a getting around perspective because everyone just enters from the west. Here's a visual of the roads: [https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wroads.htm](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wroads.htm)

"Thanks for the post and the replies. It's reassurance of our plan this April.    


We are planning to camp at LYV on the nights of the 27th and 28th of April, with a day hike to Half Dome( I know the cables will be down). We'll arrive in the valley on the 26th to get our permit.  I understand that we can camp at the Backpacker's campground the night before the date on our Wilderness permit, if it's open. The Backpacker's campground is open if North Pines is also open. This web page([https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm)) indicates that North Pines will be open starting April 11th, so I'm hopeful the Backpackers campground will also be open on the 26th.   


Then on Friday the 29th, we are hoping we can get a walk-in campsite at Camp 4 for three nights while we do some climbing in the area.

"As far as I know you only need to check in on the first or by the second day for them to hold your reservation the whole time. If you do not check in by the second day when the ranger leaves the booth than your reservation is forfeit. Some people only camp in a car or van,  but then take the vehicle with them to the trailhead or day trip to another area of the park before returning to the same campsite they reserved, so it is not unusual to see a campsite that looks empty but is actually still being used.

I believe the reservation system online will not let you cancel just one day in the middle, though it will let you edit the date range.

"I did Happy Isles->Illilouette wilderness last summer.

First off, holy smokes it’s a hard climb with a full pack, we really could have packed much less water than we did to lighten the load.  Plenty of water along the route to filter.  It felt like it was straight up the whole way there.

We ran into really bad thunder storms about 2/3 the way up, at one point my wife was growing concerned when it turned to hail.  I said at least we are not above the tree line, then I’d be concerned.  Soon enough and sure enough we cleared the tree line with it still lightening.  Not a great time for a bit.

We camped before the bridge.  Once we cleared the hill and head towards the creek, we never saw another person.  Actually, we didn’t see another person from the time we left JMT that being until we got back on the JMT in the AM. 

It was dead quiet at night back there, made all the bear precautions etc, but we never saw or heard a single animal back there. 

We hightailed it out early AM for LYC to hike Half Dome, our plans were thwarted by an early afternoon thunderstorm. So we ended up going up there the third day in the AM.

"Yosemite Falls is well worth it.

I've seen all sorts of bodies at the top.  If you are in decent shape, you can do it.

You won't get lost, the trail is super easy to follow.  Up top, it's kind of a maze of social trails, but there's so many landmarks with good lines of sight you will be fine.

The Upper Falls overlook is a must see, provided you are ok with heights.

Depending on how much you have left in your tank, Yosemite Point is well worth it.

It is safe.  The biggest safety point for solo hikers: don't go off trail.  I cannot emphasize this enough.

It's been a grotesquely warm winter.  Expect to get hot on the upper part of the trail.  This might change as your date gets nearer, we can get big April storms.

Get up and start early.  Take lots of water and snacks.  Take your time, one foot after the other, be like Dory: ""Just keep hiking, just keep hiking!""  If you don't have them, get hiking sticks, your knees will thank me on the trip down the hill.

"My friends and I climbed up to the bottom of the cables on Monday, 21 Mar. Sub Dome was pretty snowy; we used microspikes on the way up but descended via class 2-3 granite slabs because the snow was too slippery even with spikes. I’d recommend the granite route for the ascent, or take crampons; the steep snow with spikes was a little dicey. It’ll probably melt a lot this week though.

Half Dome itself was mostly dry except for a few 5m sections of ice where the cables were completely buried. We watched one group solo up the bottom patch and retie onto the cables above it but they slipped multiple times. They didn’t attempt to solo the higher patch which was much steeper and the consequence was approaching fatal. I think it might have been possible if we had a 20m rope to belay the leader with and the leader had ice picks or something. But even then, you’d have to build an anchor out of prussiks, which isn’t very safe. And the slush on top of ice on top of granite is not a reliable climbing medium. With all the sun and warm temps this week, it may melt out.

A nice backpacking trip/loop would be to hike (parts of) the North Rim: go up Yosemite Falls across to North Dome and down Snow Creek to exit out of Mirror Lake. A side trip to Eagle Peak is well worth it IMO, but adds mileage (in the opposite direction of the loop).

"\+1 for panorama trail from Happy Isles to Four-Mile Trail (and in that direction) as being the single best hike you can have, especially now that Glacier Point Road is closed, with the following comments: 

1. The side trip to Sentinel Dome (and Taft Point for the most courageous) is well worth it IMO but adds 3 miles roundtrip.
2. The 4-mile trailhead bus stop (E6) is on a different route/shuttle than the Curry Village Stop (14), meaning that you will have to wait for two different buses to get back. As such, I recommend walking over to the Sentinel Bridge bus stop (11), unless you can't fathom an additional (flat) mile or so.

"To get the most out of Yosemite in a day, I would go for 

Mist trail -> panorama trail -> glacier point -> down 4 mile trail. Then shuttle back to the start. I think it's around 13 to 16(alltrails says 13.4, I don't believe it) miles if you can handle it. Nonstop amazing views every mile. You could also do this in reverse, but I personally hate going down the mist trail against the crowds. Starting at around 6-7 am, you should have few people crowding the mist trail. 

Sunrise lakes to clouds rest is also a great long hike. It's my favorite view of the valley, you look down at half dome from 1000 feet above. Though you see a lot more variation in the mist trail to panorama hike.

"Great question! Unfortunately I’m struggling to think of an answer! 😅 

I’ve heard that living in the hubbub of the valley can be exhausting with so many tourists all the time, but I didn’t have to deal with that much. All the stores within easy reach of my residence were very expensive, even with regular things like food, but I also got two meals a day provided so it was never a great burden for me. I think most people in and out of the valley room with other people, so roommates could be a problem, but I got some pretty great ones. It got very smoky during the KNP fire of course. 

It’s probably not for everyone but I loved just about every part of the experience. The work was good, the pay was good (at least compared to my Midwestern home), the weather was lovely other than the limited smoke, and I went hiking almost every day I had off. :D",t2_56znxoob,AmUctually,0,1647905623.0,0,t1_i1lgin0,i1lgin0,False,AmUctually,t3_tjcr0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tjcr0p/i_lived_in_yosemite_for_the_last_four_months_of/,I lived in Yosemite for the last four months of 2021.

There are ways to link up with the JMT near Thousand Island Lake via this trailhead, but it won't be a ""true"" JMT hike, if that matters to you.

What you can do if you want the JMT is to hope for a ""walk up"" permit from Happy Isles or Lyell Canyon (both marked Donohue Pass eligible), or a walk up NOBO permit from Cottonwood Pass/Lakes from Inyo National Forest.

As such, and unless you do want to snow travel, it's probably wise to focus on South-facing slopes/trails that get snow-free earlier than others such as Upper Yosemite Falls and Snow Creek. The downside of Snow Creek is that, although you get nice views of Half Dome from the trail, there is no real peak or viewpoint unless you go all the way to Watkins or North Dome, both of which are likely to still have snow coverage.
