"No problem, happy trails! If you like to bike also check out the Trail of the Coeur d'Alene's, a rails-to-trails converted railway to path, which runs through the Silver Valley down to the south end of Lake CdA, it's quite long and there are a number of trailheads. 

Also, check out the Hiawatha Trail on the Idaho-Montana border that is managed by Lookout Ski Resort. It costs money, but it's a gorgeous 13 mile trail with a ton of trestle bridges and tunnels and a small waterfall. It includes the 1.5 mile long, pitch black, Taft tunnel which requires headlamps/flashlights to navigate. It's a really cool experience. The trail is a gradual 3% grade downhill the whole way, so it's easy for the whole family. At the bottom you can take a bus back to the top (the busses have seats in front and bike racks in back for the bikes), or if you're in good shape and want the workout you can bike back up yourself.",t2_glvnhx5v,iamthequeenofswords,0,1648601544.0,0,t1_i2nn829,i2nn829,False,JustanEdgyGangstar,t3_trfpjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/coeurdalene/comments/trfpjd/how_do_you_bike_from_cda_to_spokane/,How do you bike from Cda to Spokane?,/r/coeurdalene/comments/trfpjd/how_do_you_bike_from_cda_to_spokane/i2nn829/,6,r/coeurdalene,1,6

The Fernan Hill / French Gulch loop is pleasant, especially since they recently repaved the most worn portions of the latter.  I've seen that some people will combine the preceding two loops in a single ride.

Each of those have an elevation gain in the 700-800 ft. range.  If you want to really get a workout the ride up to Fernan Saddle is 2000 feet over the course of 12 miles from downtown.  Really the bulk of that ascent is in the final five miles beginning at the edge of the national forest.  The descent is usually quite pleasant, though snow and ice and currently gravel can make it a bit worrisome.  Stay vigilant on your brakes.

Finally in the other direction a trip out to Q'emlin Park in Post Falls, with at least one direction traversed via Highland Drive, is a good 20 mile loop and around 750 feet of elevation, with a brewpub at the halfway point.  Centennial Trail in that direction is fine and easy but it does go along the freeway which is loud.",t2_3cfi2,nirreskeya,0,1648563387.0,0,t1_i2keu6v,i2keu6v,True,JustanEdgyGangstar,t3_tql2cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/coeurdalene/comments/tql2cf/any_good_areas_to_bike_other_than_the_park_next/,Any good areas to bike?

"Appreciate the thought out post and I think we all can do better with the language we choose to use.  While the vaccine (as all vaccines) only directly protects the vaccinated, there is an argument to be made that being vaccinated indirectly protects others because it lowers your risk of hospitalization and may interrupt chains of transmission (though more studies need to be done about that).

Getting the vaccine, like most things in this country, is a choice. No one will ever come to your door, strap you down and forcibly give it to you. I feel one of the main issue is that moving forward, people don't want to be subjected to the consequences of their choice.  Try to walk into a store with no pants on, they'll likely kick you out. It's your choice not to wear pants, but that doesn't mean businesses (or other people) have to deal with you. 

Also, no one is going to take anything from anyone if they're unvaccinated. If the job you work for decides to require it.. Then you either get it or you don't, it's just a choice. Just like your job could require you to dress like a clown, and if you don't want to, you quit. But you do have to accept the consequences of your actions.

"Sorry for the inflammatory language. I don't really believe in linguistic manipulation for purposes of polishing controversial & potentially amoral subject matter in contradiction to discussing controversial subject matter to begin with. But I do concede that I can lighten up a bit with it. And I'm not ""anti-abortion"", if that matters. Thank you though, regardless.

You're right, it's not about the value/efficacy of the vaccine (edit: which seems self-evident in how much more political this ""pandemic"" is than diseases that nobody dares come in contact with). It's about the undeniable political action that may have started the pandemic to begin with, along with the political powerplay against individual sovereignty and group respect flowering, and most importantly:

The difference between your example where the military requires vaccination, as well as public schools, and beyond and this situation is that people have already been working their entire lives trying to earn their positions in the world, vs being told ""if you don't take these vaccines, you cannot deploy"" or ""if you don't take these required vaccines, you can't enter the school system"". That gives you a choice to GAIN something. Telling people ""If you don't get this vaccine that protects YOU (and not others, as clearly communicated by the CDC, and seen in action via Omicron) in the name of succumbing to my politically-charged position on this situation, I will take everything that you've been working for your entire life. Those two things aren't even in the same universe with each other, in my opinion. That doesn't even begin to get into the variance in outcome depending on state jurisdiction and how they each approached the situation. That's a meta-analysis to be seen in a few years, but without nitpicking every single occurrence of political decision-making along the way from August 2018 until present, the fundamental issue I take is with the tyrannical application of the vaccine by many, as if people aren't capable of or free to draw their own conclusions about their medical health depending on who's in office.",t2_2it3y8e5,walksthiswalk,0,1648524689.0,0,t1_i2it5dn,i2it5dn,False,kelloggflakes,t3_tpyuiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/coeurdalene/comments/tpyuiz/idaho_legislature_passes_bill_to_protect_the/,Idaho Legislature passes bill to protect the unvaccinated from being “treated differently or discriminated against”,/r/coeurdalene/comments/tpyuiz/idaho_legislature_passes_bill_to_protect_the/i2it5dn/,3,r/coeurdalene,0,3

"Found this poor girl at 6pm, 3/23 near Cherry Hill. Checking her out at the emergency vet right now to make sure she doesn't have anything immediately dire. She's badly emaciated and is blind in her left eye, serious oral issues, and afterwards I'm going to make her a warm spot in my garage with food, water, and bedding. I'm not sure how long she's been out, but she isn't aggressive whatsoever. She also has a chip but isn't registered.

UPDATE: I don't have the kind of living situation where I'm able to keep her at all, so I was forced to turn her over to CDA animal control.

Fuck suburban sprawl

To add, its estimated we are ~5.5 MILLION housing units short NATIONWIDE. This is not a cda specific problem but the fact there is no local focus on affordable housing compounds the problem.

To add more, this is EXACTLY why government is important. You think the free market will ever build low income or middle housing without regulation or ordinances? Nope. Out of state developers will continue to build million dollar condos on the river to the highest bidder while locals get to sleep in their cars.

Contact your county and city officials and vote for people who are looking to build affordable density instead of ""all government bad/no growth"". Growth is coming no matter what. Better do something about it now.

"Budget is going to be a major factor but here’s the real answer:

Play cda resort or circling raven for golf.

Mineral ridge hike.

Rent a boat on cda lake, take it to Harrison and get off and eat/drink, maybe cruise down the cda river. 

I’d air bnb anywhere downtown or on cda lake, if hotel try the cda resort.

The other alternative is to come check out cda and move this whole thing to priest lake which is a lake an hour and half north of cda.  Lodging is hills or Elkins or a waterfront air bnb.  Priest lake golf course, tons of hiking and boat rentals with Elkins, take boat up to the thoroughfare etc…

Priest is more rural though, if you are looking for more of a downtown nightlife bachelor party vibe then cda is the place.  Hard to recommend bars I mean you will see the scene, you can easily hit most of them in a night or 2.
 
Both places will be busy especially cda, I’d suggest booking these things like now.

"That's all anyone who isn't from here knows about this place, it's all the national press ever talked about, which is sad because we didn't ask for them to come here. The hate group this area is know for was the Aryan Nations, and it was NOT HOMEGROWN. It's founder Richard Butler came here from California by way of Colorado in the 1980s back when land here was still dirt cheap. He bought some property, then invited like-minded assholes from around the country to come join him and live on his land. I've lived here since the early 80s, I grew up here during that era. The vast majority of locals all hated them being here and went to a lot of effort trying to get them out. A community human rights council was created specifically for the purpose of kicking them out. Ultimately we were successful in suing them after a shooting incident, Butler lost everything including the land and went bankrupt and died a few years later. We never asked for him to come, the overwhelming majority didn't want him here, but we'll be forever tainted by proximity. 

The sad truth is that racists exist and they are in practically every single town and city in this country. Most just don't intentionally try to draw attention to themselves like Butler did - that's the difference. If you look at cities like LA, Baltimore, Chicago, St. Louis, or the deep south you'll see waaaaaaay more evidence and incidents per capita of racially motivated violence and tensions than you'll ever find here, despite our notorious ""history"". Are there racists here?

"Take this with a grain of salt because I haven’t yet been able to have a lot of direct experience with therapy. But at minimum I think it would be really helpful for a therapist to offer regular group Zoom meetings where a variety of genera mental support strategies and coping mechanisms are taught.

For example when I started experiencing regular panic attacks for the first time in 2020, I had no clue what was happening to me or how to proceed. I happened to bring it up to a friend who was seeing a therapist and she taught me what panic attacks are, then shared the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding method. I was able to start using that immediately to help tide over until I could find someone for more targeted care. It made a huge difference in my day to day peace of mind and opened my eyes to the possibilities of changing my life for the better through principles taught in therapy.

Of course the internet is a great resource for learning about mental health but when I am really struggling, it’s overwhelming to try and distill only what I need from the firehose of info online. Having a regular class to attend to learn skills would be so useful.

"Yes. My father in law went in for severe back pain. After weeks of them just giving him steroids for nerve pain, they finally deigned to look closer.

Read to the end of the article, I'll quote it here. He's basically a bully who yells at people and intimidates them, literally sucks with money, and is going to bankrupt the school. ""Former NIC President Rick MacLennan, fired from the college without cause last September by the board majority, described his eyewitness account of Banducci's physical assault of a female college employee at a college-sponsored event on Dec. 10, 2019. That description was included in an email provided to The Press through a public records request.  
The NWCCU panel report declares Banducci is not to be involved in NIC Foundation operations or fundraising, based on an agreement between him and the foundation.  
In April 2020, the board issued a private censure to Banducci for conduct they believed “falls below the standard expected of an NIC Trustee.”  
According to the panel report, the NIC Foundation indicated a loss of approximately $4.1 million in legacy gifts, $343,000 in estimated Major Gifts and another $36,800 in annual donations.  
In a meeting with the NIC Foundation, the investigating panel found the Foundation Board had lost a “historically very positive relationship with the NIC board and the administration.”  
Hazel said the college can't afford Banducci. She cited the nearly $500,000 paid out to MacLennan for his remaining contract and from a lawsuit; the funds paid for a search firm to assist in filling MacLennan’s position; replacing administrators who left the college after his firing; and donations to the NIC Foundation that will not be realized.  
“His agenda is too expensive,” Hazel said. “Community members understand this when they sign our petition, and they’re taking a stand that we’ve lost confidence in the scorched earth leadership that has been brought to us by Todd Banducci.”",t2_5jmgrfo8,Weighenough444,0,1647624091.0,0,t1_i16e112,i16e112,False,Weighenough444,t3_th1u01,https://www.reddit.com/r/coeurdalene/comments/th1u01/resign_banducci_save_nic/,Resign Banducci - Save NIC,/r/coeurdalene/comments/th1u01/resign_banducci_save_nic/i16e112/,5,r/coeurdalene,0,5
