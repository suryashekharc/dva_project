Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"What you said is true to expent, but I’ve seen a lot of new money and development being pumped into Roseburg over the past year or so. Not sure if that’s red or blue or old or new generation wealth coming In don’t really care as long as buildings are left to crumble, esp. the older stone and brick ones. 

Take the downtown for instance. It seemed like a lot of those store fronts use to be vacant  / falling apart.  I’m seeing more and more activity which gives me hope for some sort of a solid community music scene. Open mics would be great.

Also there was talk of a climbing gym opening at one point does anyone know what happened with that and why it fell through or is it just tied up in the development / planning phase.  No  pun intended

It seems like Roseburg could defiantly benefit from a Bouldering or roped climbing gym. Not a lot of taller open interior structures to choose from for the latter. I can’t see new development and a new climbing gym popping up but I can definitely see repurposing an existing building and opening a smaller / mid size bouldering gym.

Just to echo others, good stuff, the Y, wineries/breweries, outdoor activities galore, disk golf...etc. The bike path around Stewart Park has some sketchy places, but every interaction I've had while walking my dogs is friendly.

"I moved from the bay area (although grew up in Portland, and spouse is from Roseburg).

It is a right-wing area, don't go putting Biden stickers on your car if you value it not getting keyed. There is a GIANT ""TRUMP 1"" sign on our hill overlooking the entire city (next to a giant christian cross).

Just about everyone goes to church, even lefty type people. So expect religion. We also have church signs that abortion = holocaust. Also abortion protestors are common. 

Our local police refused to enforce any mask mandates, and in general our congress rep has been a conspiracy theorist type guy (he recently died). Just to get an idea of who the people here vote for. 

For food, there isn't much. Generally fast food or cheap food. Not a lot of ""good tasting"" food, but there are a few spots. In general though, ""value food"" is what wins here, large & cheap meals that don't need taste. 

Ok, so after all that crap, the area is just beautiful. The river is wonderful, you can raft down it. Driving in the area is often near the river and through the woods, so driving anywhere is cool. 

There is a wildlife safari nearby, lots of winery / breweries, and as others have said the local YMCA has a ton of family type activities. There are parks all over, so good for kids to easily get to a park and play. 

I would say the best way to describe how ""friendly"" people are, is to say that if they will know you, they will be nice to you. If they will never see you again, they will treat you like the worst person in the city. For example, your neighbors will be nice to you, but the rando stranger at the local grocery store would not mind stealing the shopping cart you were about to grab. 

Also as a bay area driver, drivers here are horrible. I thought california drivers were bad, but drivers here drive like the city drivers did during rush hour. People will cut you off even though there is no one in front of you. Within 9 months of being here, our car has gotten hit, and nearly hit 2 other times. All people changing lanes without looking. I would recommend a dashboard camera. 

I know I kind of unloaded a lot of bad, but I do love the area except for the religion. You can't escape religion here, and not just ""help your neighbor"" kind, but the judgemental kind. The kind that will protest abortion all of 100 ft away from a homeless encampment. But the area is fun, wonderful, and if you can ignore the people it is a great place to live.

"Moved to Roseburg from Philadelphia about three months ago and we love it! We’ve met a lot of people through taste testing beers at the breweries and the wineries. Also, the YMCA has been a great place to connect with new families and individuals. They have a ton of families activities and a skating rink. Compared to other cities and places we’ve visited and lived, Roseburg has been awesome. Just depends on what your looking for! 

As far as homelessness, i thought the issue is rather small compared to cities more north in the state or compared to Philly but yes there is a homelessness problem and a drug problem but that’s America.

"My current favorite for Chinese food is Chen's. The meat and veggies are always fresh and the food is well prepared and consistent. It looks like a lot of people eat mainly the deep fried stuff there, but the spicy sir fried dishes are really good, too. 

Chinese restaurants tend to have very Americanized food. I've eaten at old school San Francisco Chinatown restaurants and restaurants here aren't too different. Differences I've noticed: Southern Oregon is known for serving pink sauce with Mar Far chicken. The pot sticker thing sounds weird. I would expect them pan fried. That might be an individual restaurant thing. Older restaurants in this area sometimes use spaghetti type noodles rather than more authentic types. Roseburg restaurants sometimes lean towards large portions of mediocre, heavy food, but that may be changing as things sort out post pandemic.

"'Conservatives'? well, should i start with Goldwater?  What i know from the last two administrations is...while a 'republican' is president, there is no such thing as a debt ceiling, That its okay for republican sheriffs to ignore rulings from Democratic governors, but not the other way around.  'Biblical' principles never mentioned in the new testament should guide civil and foreign policy. That only one religion matters, and if you practice a faith they don't like, then you're a terrorist.  Rugged individualism for taxpayers, public assistance and socialized debts for banks.  Certain unelected political officers are immune to subpoenas issued by congress, it's okay for a sitting US Senator to fly to a resort while his constituents are freezing to death.  if you're a loyal to the President, but a traitor to the Constitution, That same President will give you a pardon.

"No, none of those are due to overpopulation. We discard like 1/3rd or all food produced in the US currently, it's not a problem of overpopulation as much as it is a problem of logistics and resource distribution, shit not going to the people that need it. Sustainable development is possible at scale, we're just not accustomed to it in the US, or in the western world, or in the general world, at large. Even the social democracies found in the nordic countries, which are generally good blueprints to point to, still struggle with shit like exploitation of the third world and of domestic workers. To elaborate on this more, I'm not sure if you've heard of the ""economic calculation problem"", but we can basically just reapply that to current global economies. We obviously have the will and means to produce gross and horrendously opulent amounts of trash that nobody needs, wants, or even, is allowed to have access to, if we simply look at how much people throw away. Now, why is this shit all being made?

Our problem is basically imposing our mentality of absolute independence onto everyone else, even domestically, a mentality that doesn't even make any sense, really. Society is inherently interdependent, seeking to minimize that because we have such a lack of faith, such a deeply rooted cynicism, in peoples of all backgrounds, even in ourselves, is our main problem. It's not something like ""the industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for humanity"", as much as our application of the preceding mentalities coming out of feudalism to this new age have been. This has resulted in a massive concentration of power in western european countries, a concentration of power in business owners, and politicians, because our cynicism has been exploited. I don't believe that this cynicism is a part of human nature, either, because I think humans are the only animal that has such a massive ability to change our own nature. What we need is real democracy and self-governance at every level, to ensure that shit that needs to be made actually gets made, and goes to who needs it the most, rather than just getting dumped because it wasn't profitable, because profit can't account for  the bigger picture or long term costs, and neither can any other system, really, except for just decentralizing power in massive quantities, and in real terms.",t2_cdksb4ee,Top_Independence8255,0,1641607931.0,0,t1_hrq38ir,hrq38ir,False,Herbnhood,t3_rx9xtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/roseburg/comments/rx9xtp/josh_chavez_of_roseburg_pd_threatens_to_displace/,Josh Chavez of Roseburg PD threatens to displace camp of 100 people in the middle of winter and the height pandemic,/r/roseburg/comments/rx9xtp/josh_chavez_of_roseburg_pd_threatens_to_displace/hrq38ir/,3,r/roseburg,0,3

"You realize that defunding the police is not the equivalent of total anarchy, right? That's a disingenuous summation of the proposal. 

Defunding the police means reallocating those funds to services more appropriately designed to address the current needs of society. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. 

If you agree we need extreme change, then why not create/fund organizations, resources, and specialists that already know how to address existing problems, rather than try to convert a broken system, full of resistance, to do something it was never designed to do? If the current police system were interested in reforming themselves, they would have done that already. 

If all I had was an Italian restaurant but everyone in my town wanted Chinese food, I wouldn't reform the Italian restaurant, I'd close it (defund), and open a Chinese restaurant (reallocated funds) with people who already know how to cook Chinese food.",t2_43li4,bobfnord,0,1641590796.0,0,t1_hrox6mn,hrox6mn,False,Herbnhood,t3_rx9xtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/roseburg/comments/rx9xtp/josh_chavez_of_roseburg_pd_threatens_to_displace/,Josh Chavez of Roseburg PD threatens to displace camp of 100 people in the middle of winter and the height pandemic,/r/roseburg/comments/rx9xtp/josh_chavez_of_roseburg_pd_threatens_to_displace/hrox6mn/,3,r/roseburg,0,3

In residential treatment settings if a resident breaks a wall, they fix and keep moving.  It’s important to keep this framework in mind.

I run the bike path a lot early mornings on weekends.  During the week in a lot of parks.  To be honest I don’t always feel safe.  And tend to run later now when there is more light but that’s not an option here.  Also a former biker tho and understand that too.  Along the path there are a lot of broken fences and what seem like temporary camps.  I assume but am not sure it is patrolled.  My rule of thumb nowadays is I would rather be seen and be able to see what’s around me.  And have immediate access to assistance even if I got randomly hurt.  For the most part when I do encounter people in the early hours they just want to be left alone and are as scared as we are.

As you know racism has become more 'acceptable' in the last 10 years. Lots of good folks here none the less. As others have offered feel free to contact me to talk more.

"Roseburg is really, really whitewashed and hard-core trumpism/anti-BLM. It is also a retirement community with old school racist mentalities. People are very upfront with their political views so if you do not follow them, try to steer away from those conversations. I say this as a white person who has lived in the area since I was a kid and recently moved away from there. 

I don't recommend having anything slightly liberal on your vehicle, as chances are it will get vandalized or you will get harassed for it. The County itself runs very two-faced, smiles when you are around and bad mouthing you behind your back. You will probably not experience overt racism but you will hear plenty of rumors about you and they will be brought to your attention. Your husband should be prepared for being the token ""I am friends with a black person so therefore I am not racist"" trope. There are people who aren't like that but they stick to a small area so you will have to look.

Roseburg is very much like the bible-belt southern states, so expect lack of understanding about scientific anything.  I do not recommend going to Mercy for any sort of healthcare, even more so now with CoVid pushing it to the max capacity it can handle.

0/10, would not live there again if I can help it.

That being said, if you don't mind keeping to yourself, it is remote enough that you can do so. The area is well forested and there is plenty of hiking, wineries etc. Keep in mind that Douglas County as a whole is trying to separate from Oregon and get added to Idaho.",t2_2spdgs89,ConstantNurse,0,1629857769.0,0,t1_ha8r5bo,ha8r5bo,True,zookeepercd,t3_pazdy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/roseburg/comments/pazdy8/moving_to_roseburg/,Moving to Roseburg,/r/roseburg/comments/pazdy8/moving_to_roseburg/ha8r5bo/,12,r/roseburg,0,12

"Theres not a lot of racism here. Im mexican and have lived here since i was 7. Besides some ball busting here and there i never experienced anything absurd. If he's a good and respectful guy i think people will like him even more. Its nice to change some peoples views on cultures and races. Yeah i have to pretend i'm a conservative from time to time just to keep the peace LOL but other than that its smooth sailing. Respect rules all here. I actually think a lot of people here welcome some different cultures and races. Yeah there will always be those people that only want people here that look like them but thats in every town and city everywhere. 

One thing i will say is dont be offended by people saying some ""odd"" stuff sometimes. Chalk it up to them just not being around very many colored people before. So a joke or remark might fall flat in your presence but just brush it off. They honestly dont know any better and come from a family whos gone generation after generation around only white people.

Where in Florida? I’m from Roseburg but grew up in Florida and certain parts are more open minded that’s for sure. My feeling on Roseburg is it’s more small town ignorance and less racism.

I don't get why you need to mention you're black, or raised in the county, or not on welfare.

It doesn't really change that having pride flags makes you a target, and that there are a ton of hypocrites that live here.

My spouse was raise and graduated here, and she feels the most threatened by the various views because she knows them. Hell, I have family here that refuse to get the vax even though they work in fast food. Including going to work sick because they are shot staffed.

I feel you are just kind of coming at it left field here, not sure what you are getting at. The OP was about damage to her car for BLM stickers, I mentioned how I knew from growing up that we would get hate for simply having california plates, I can tell you how my lesbian neighbors mention how they get hate for their pride stuff.

And if we want to get more into these people, my daycare provider, I can tell you that they openly admit that not only do they think Covid is fake, but they falsify taking of temperatures of kids. So even if the kid has a fever, the daycare keeps the kid there. Disease spread rampant through that daycare and I am actively trying to move my kids out.

There were covid regulations that removed the banning of long-term habitation for homeless people.  Those have been lifted and the city has helped those people move on.
