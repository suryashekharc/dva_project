"So make friends? Finding a hobby is a great start. My coworkers are mostly redneck shitheads too, but you know what? I see them for 5 minutes a day. The actual people I spend real time with are fantastic. York is a very diverse county. The city, suburbs, and rural towns all have their own cultures. The 83 corridor, for instance, is very suburban and attitudes are very cosmopolitan. You may find it more racist and homophobic in, say, Delta. I'm sure with a bit of work, you too can create an awesome, active, progressive, and interesting group of friends too. 

This negative energy you're putting forward will turn off a lot of people before you ever get to that stage, however, so I'd look at addressing the aggression you put off first. Maybe you're just having a bad day, but it puts people on the defensive from the get go, which makes it hard for them to open up to you.

"What things are you looking to do? York's got a lot to offer if you know where to look. Excellent outdoorsman's area, with top-tier biking (Enola Low Grade, NCR), hiking (NCR, Mason-Dixon Trail, Appalachian Trail) kayaking (Redman, Marburg, the Susquehanna, Safe Harbor Park), hunting (tons of state game lands) and fishing (too many good spots to list) access. 

The food (have you tried Handsome Cab? The First Post?) and especially farmers market (Central Market, Browns, Markets at Shrewsbury) / local crafts (Central Market block, Morningstar Market, Market at Shrewsbury) scene is excellent. Most people are astounded that we have half a dozen local butcher shops for instance (Miller's, Sechrists, Godfreys), real independent grocers (Nells), and access to endless local produce (Jmar? Markeys?) and goods (Anderson's Honey? Carman's Ice Cream?). 

You can easily day trip Baltimore, Philadelphia, and DC from here, and easily weekend trip NYC, Pittsburgh, and Richmond, if you want things only found in bigger cities, like top-tier sports venues or night clubs. Yeah, we have the Revs and The Cove is open late, but we don't have what even Baltimore can offer for that. 

Finally, the cost of living / quality of life is excellent. Honestly, would I rather live in Philly or Boston? Probably. Can I afford to have the acre + plot, 4br3ba house, 2 new cars, etc etc, and live there? No way! So take that into consideration.

"We have a very interesting competitive gas station market here. In Pennsylvania (probably the rest of the country too, but I'll stay in my lane) gas stations barely break even on gas sales. Therefore, to remain able to turn a profit, they sell you other things you might need. These companies found that the profit margin for prepared food was humongous compared to simply reselling packaged food/drink so they invested heavily.

It's a hot as fuck market that hasn't really slowed down for at least the 10+ years I've been watching it. Ontop of the food and the regular convenience store items, we have beer/malt/wine sales (huge deal for PA liquor laws), slot machines, huge tobacco+cbd selections, fully stocked coffee bars with every possible bean, creamer, and sweetener. You name it, it's there. And if you're a tractor trailer driver, Rutter's even has truck parking at a lot of their locations with long diesel fuel pumps and well lit and recorded areas for safety.

There’s a greyhound station downtown with busses straight to Baltimore daily and it costs $20 or less and gets you there in 60 min. The light rail/rabbit thing takes several hours and is only a little cheaper. I live in York and don’t drive so I’ve done both and would highly recommend greyhound over rabbit transit.

From what I can see on the rural end of things is that properties are selling over what they are listed for and usually in a quick turn-around (haven’t seen a house sit on the market longer than a week) .. a lot of people are moving up to York Co from Baltimore surrounding areas which is causing our market to get competitive over what’s available. So; if you’re looking - my advice is you gotta move fast... best of luck to you ❤️,t2_2bayx7l1,butterbeanstew,0,1623507719.0,0,t1_h1inrmd,h1inrmd,True,cat_gato_neko,t3_ny7512,https://www.reddit.com/r/YorkCountyPA/comments/ny7512/housing_market/,Housing Market,/r/YorkCountyPA/comments/ny7512/housing_market/h1inrmd/,1,r/YorkCountyPA,0,1

They made a correction about her being torn from the car and so should make a correction about the protestors having right of way. They had right of way on another street and just started marching all over the roads with no permits or barricades. Something very similar happened in my area. Protesters had the right to march on a side street but walked out into a main thoroughfare. A woman came around the band right before the intersection and encountered protesters in the the middle of the street trying to block traffic. The car was surrounded and she panicked because they were screaming at her and damaging the car. Somehow she caught a charge but not a single out of place protester did. I watched that video. She got dragged from the car. Just because she got out to see what was going on gave nobody the right to attack her.

"I have primarily lived and worked in Hanover for 15 years, and it's not all that bad. Now in my late 30s with young kids. Increasingly there are more things for young professionals to do in town, and it's easy to get involved in local organizations if you want to.

0:30 from York, 1:00 from Baltimore, 1:45 from DC, less than 1:30 from Harper's Ferry WV (hiking, history), 25 minutes from Gettysburg, 1:30 from Summit Point Raceway if you're into racing, etc- and a state park with a reasonably nice lake and facilities basically right in town. It's not a bad jumping off point for day trips beyond what's right in town. There are an increasing number of brew pubs (Miscreation, Something Wicked, Sign of the Horse) and other small businesses opening and seeming to do reasonably well now as there is more interest in shopping places other than Walmart.

"Craigslist has been the most popular website for finding roommates because it’s free and has the most members. Unfortunately, it’s not that easy to have a quality pool of candidates when you’re using websites that have little to no security in place to protect its consumers. Luckily, there are sites available that are focused on verifying members identify, allowing members to write reviews, and running background checks.  Here are a few alternatives besides Craigslist to consider.

1.[ **Haydash**](https://haydash.com/roomshare-search/)**-** a new website that requires all of their members to go through a criminal background check before becoming a member. Imagine knowing that everyone you communicate with on the website has as already completed a background check.

2. [**Rommiapp**](https://roomiapp.com/)**-** has some options for verifying your identity through a text message verification and a few options for connecting through your social media accounts. They also offer members the option to complete a background check to obtain a badge on their profile to show they were approved. Since it is optional majority of the members have not completed a check.

3. [**Roomster**](https://www.roomster.com/listings/new)**-** is similar to Roomiapp as they allow you to connect your social media account to your profile and they offer optional credit checks and optional background checks.

4. [**Silvernest**](http://www.silvernest.com/)\- is targeted towards retired seniors (65 +). Each applicant must go through an identity, email and telephone verification process before they are active on the website.",t2_4adf3sap,living2travel,0,1569439811.0,0,t1_f1f9scg,f1f9scg,True,Stupidstray,t3_d97jti,https://www.reddit.com/r/YorkCountyPA/comments/d97jti/finding_a_roommate_in_york/,Finding a Roommate in York?,/r/YorkCountyPA/comments/d97jti/finding_a_roommate_in_york/f1f9scg/,7,r/YorkCountyPA,0,7

"That way that we purchased it, no.  Unfortunately, my in-laws didn't listen to my sense to allow me to select the cuts and then we would sit with everything and distribute when it was all taken home.

They instead insisted we have 4 separate boxes, each named to a particular family (3 kids and their parents, so 4 boxes).  This meant that Nells cut the cow in accordance with their 1/4 animal policy.  This meant all delmonicos, no tomahawk chop ribeyes.  No standing rib roast either.  No tri-tip, just sirloin steaks that could have been cut nicer.  Lots of bottom round, which was cut into nothing but roasts, while I'd have liked some london broil and cube steak.

The beef itself is great.  It could be more marbled, but that is the trade off with grass fed vs. corn fed.  The flavor is exactly what I was looking for.  My major issue was the cuts we received.  That is why I stressed to make sure you select the cuts from all parts of the cow, exactly how you want.  I haven't worked with a butcher that won't cut it the way you want it so take the time to work with them and allow them to educate you while sticking to the cuts you desire.

"I haven't bought an entire animal from Godfrey Brothers, but I suspect their price is competitive.  When my in-laws and I went in on one from Nell's it was roughly $3k for the whole cow, including the butcher fees.  We all went in on a 1/4 each and it cost my wife and me just under $750.  So for a 1/2 a cow you are looking at around $1500 or so.

The nice thing about getting an entire 1/2 is that you get the choice on ALL cuts.

"I work in Hunt Valley and live in Glen Rock.  Typical commute is 30 minutes door to door, and I really like the area.  It’s quiet but there’s enough to do if you go looking for it.

"I spent 5(?) years commuting from Parkville to York, then to Glen Rock (1 exit north past Shrewsbury). I now live in Glen Rock.  

Shrewsbury isn't bad, I was actually looking at houses around there until I got a deal a bit further off the beaten path.  
As others have said, there's really not a lot going on hereabouts, but if you spend most of your time streaming web content and working (like me) it's not a huge deal. Take a look at the stores in the area, because that's what you get without going for a drive. Coming from the Baltimore area, intellectually I knew that would be true, but it has been a bit of a shock how limited options for pretty much everything are. Shrewsbury has far more than my immediate area does, so it's less of ""there's nothing"" and more ""I can count my choices for any given thing on a couple fingers"".  

Re racism: I can't say for sure what your experience might be (me being a white male) but when I first moved up here I experienced some casual racist talk that shocked me. Not hate speech per se, but this really isn't a diverse area. That being said, I don't get out much so it could be better or worse than my anecdotal experience talking to contractors.  

Some additional things to keep in mind:  
Moving over the border you'll be a PA resident and things are a little different here with regards to things like taxes, vehicle inspections, alcohol laws.

"**disclaimer:** I am not with the company in charge of 83, but one of their subcontractors, progress is actually being made on Mt Rose. nor am I trying to defend the shitty management by PennDOT or construction practices of Tutor Perini (d/b/a Cherry hill construction).  we have actually had a hard time getting paid for some of the non-contract work we have done for them (rental of our crash trucks to repair the crash cushions that you all love to connect with).  

Cherry Hill started this project doing a bunch of work out of phasing

The problem *NOW* is that all of the major remaining work activities Have to be done sequentially.  

\- The widening of the bridge carrying SB 83 over the creek at the south end of the project was subcontracted out to another company, started mid spring, and completed about 2 weeks ago.

\- Paving (including around the above bridge widening for the traffic switch to shift 83 SB traffic back towards the water company was completed the other night, and barrier has been set, and the majority of the markings are down. The traffic switch is currently (weather permitting) planned for tonight, Friday June 12.

\- Once the traffic switch is complete, the center support for the bridge carrying Mt rose over 83 can be built, and then the beams and bridge super structure for the south side of that bridge can be built.

"Check out Downtown York, the windows are always done nicely and the square is lit for the holidays. Also Royal Square has beautiful lights that outline the buildings as well as the fire department. In Royal Square there are a bunch of small shops and gallery’s. (I may be a little biased because I co-own one, but I really think Royal Square is a cool spot.) redeux is good for Christmas shopping. Plus there are breweries all over town, if you’re into that sort of thing. If you’ll be there on the first Friday of a month the whole town has special things going on. Some of my favorite places in York are- Molly’s Courtyard Cafe, Central Market, Ironic, reduex, The Hive. (And if you are into art I could give you a huge list of Galleries) 
As far as activities, there’s the holiday lights walk (can’t remember exactly what it’s called) at Rocky Ridge Park. There’s Festivus (an ice sculpture event that goes on around the city) and I know our studio (OMG Studios) will be having group art classes.

"""Safe"" is always relative but downtown/ Newton will be a big step up from where you're at currently. I personally like the hustle and bustle downtown and the huge range of people you encounter. With the courthouse and police headquarters there's a big presence. I know there are also a lot of plainclothes cops circulating around the area on a daily basis as well. And with all the County people who come into town for the market and restaurants, there's a big incentive to keep downtown safe.

I've heard gunshots a few times over the past two years and a guy got killed a few blocks up my alley last year. But like any city, most violence is intergroup and if you're not involved in that you're probably okay. Walking my dog at 3 am sometimes gets interesting, but that's mostly because everybody seems to have a sick grandmother in Gettysburg and needs bus fare to see her, if you know what I mean.
