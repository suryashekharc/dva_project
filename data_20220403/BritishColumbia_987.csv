"Revenue from rent is not the same as profit. 

If you have mortgage payments of $2K/month, plus property taxes, plus insurance, +tenancy insurance, you're looking at around $2700/month. 

So, to continue to make payments, and keep the place, MINIMUM would be $2700, you would think, right? Wrong. There's maintenance, like clearing the gutters, yard work, annual inspections for leaks, etc...so, throw in $1000 on top for that, to budget, also to account for impending major repairs/emergency fund. So, rent is now $3700? Right? Wrong. 

All these arrangements take time, so, tack on a little extra for your time, and rent is now $4K. 

So, $300×12=profit=$3600. That's a far cry from $15K. 

(I'm using a house as an example). 

Let's assume OP owns the house outright, and has no mortgage.  Let's take $2K off that final rental price: Now you think, oh, well rent would be $2K, right? Wrong. See, governments charge Capital Gains Tax on rent collected, and you, the property owner are taxed at ""the market value of rent"" for that property.  So, if rent in the area is $4K, and you charge $2K. The capital gains tax on that means your profit goes from $2K to about $1000. Again, you've got things to budget for, and $1K/month isn't going to cover that. So, you have to jack it up to cover the costs of the Capital Gains Tax. 

Lastly, let's suppose the home owner bought the house in 2010, after the GFC, and house prices took a minor hit, and they got a smoking deal. Let's suppose they bought the house for $750K, and now it's worth $2.5M. Just because the value has changed, doesn't mean that the homeowner has realized any net financial gain. Their net worth has gone up, but the cash in their bank account hasn't changed. Therefore, they're not amazingly wealthy, per se. They just happened to buy the right house at the right time, for now.  If this house was purchased in Richmond, and ""The Big One"" hits, and floods 3/4 of Richmond, and this house gets extreme water damage, the property value will go from $2.5M to likely, $150K. 

While real estate, in general terms is a solid investment, it is still a risk. Maybe not as risky as sticking your dick in a crocodile's mouth, but, it's still a risk nonetheless.  

Now, you might think that taxation on real estate profits is great, but, in the end, those costs get downloaded onto the tenants.",t2_76t8twk0,AlexJamesCook,1,1649000911.0,0,t1_i38gul8,i38gul8,False,nowaynorway1,t3_tv41zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tv41zl/rented_out_my_unit_a_year_later_this_happened_to/,"Rented out my unit, a year later this happened to my wall",/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tv41zl/rented_out_my_unit_a_year_later_this_happened_to/i38gul8/,1,r/britishcolumbia,0,1

" Ontario took the lead in this a couple of years ago. The Ontario SPCA wasn't able to do the job they wanted to with the resources they had. So a new organization was created. This is the model that should be repeated everywhere in Canada. A charitable organization that relies on donations cannot be effective. ie if the Vancouver aquarium gave the BC SPCA a massive donation, would it be right for the BC SPCA to be the agency investigating animal cruelty complaints at the Vancouver Aquarium ?  


 If a large poultry or factory farmed pig operation gave money to the SPCA, could the SPCA then be the organization tasked with investigating cruelty complaints there ?

PROVINCIAL ANIMAL WELFARE SERVICES (PAWS)  
  
April 29, 2020  
https://assistancedogregistry.com/provincial-animal-welfare-services-paws/  
  
'Yesterday, the Provincial Animal Welfare Services (PAWS) Act came into force, creating the first fully provincial government-based animal welfare enforcement system in Canada. Ontario now has the strongest penalties in Canada for people who violate animal welfare laws.  
  
“People care about the welfare of animals and so does our government,” said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. “We committed to creating a strong, new system to protect animals, and we have delivered on that promise.”  


  
Effective January 1, 2020, Ontario will:  
  
Implement the new model with more inspectors to provide province-wide coverage, including those with specialized expertise in livestock, zoos, aquariums and equines.  
  
Enable courts to impose the highest financial penalties for offenders in Canada.  
  
Update prohibitions and obligations, such as barring the return of dog fighting equipment to a person convicted of an offence and harming or attempting to harm a service animal or one that works with peace officers.  
  
Establish new oversight of inspectors that offers increased transparency and accountability, as well as a one-window complaints mechanism for the public.  
  
Establish a multi-disciplinary advisory table made up of a wide range of experts, including veterinarians, agriculture representatives, academics, animal advocates and others to provide ongoing advice to the ministry.  
  
Transitional regulations have been put in place to ensure animals are protected while long-term regulations are developed through consultation, including through the multi-disciplinary table.  
  
The province has established a toll-free number, 1-833-9-ANIMAL (264625) for people to report concerns about animal distress or abuse. This call centre is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.'",t2_99xgav37,Bean_Tiger,0,1648975163.0,0,t1_i37auxj,i37auxj,True,Bean_Tiger,t3_tuo520,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tuo520/activists_protest_inside_bc_spca_office_demand/,"Activists protest inside B.C.

"A) good luck ever finding a truck that's newer than 5 years old ICE or EV that costs less than $20k. The average retail for a full sized ICE truck is between $50k-$70k. It will take a while for those prices to come down (on the used market). It's also doubtful that an EV truck will ever retail less than an ICE truck. It will probably match it, but won't go under. Owning a full size pickup these days is a terrible financial decision unless you got actual uses for one on a regular basis.

You might be thinking about mid-size, but the prices on those are creeping up as well. Often pushing $50k-$60k. Once again, automakers will never sell a BEV cheaper than a ICEV, even if it costs them less to make it.

What about the Maverick or a future (maybe) Maverick EV? Well, you can't get them for under $20k in Canada. Lowest they go for is $25k in Canada. Again manufacturers will never sell an EV less than an ICEV, so even if Ford were to make a Maverick EV, it would start at around $30k-$35k.

To be honest, the only new vehicle that you can get right now for under $20k is a sub-compact and there are less and less of those on sale every year. The market just isn't there like it used to.

With most EV owners, total cost of ownership (TCO) is a more important metric than upfront costs. If an EV truck costs $20k more upfront, but was an operating cost that is $4k cheaper per year, the difference is paid back in 5 years. Every year that EV truck is owned past the break-even point is all gravy for the owner.

B) Cars can't deny the laws of physics or thermodynamics. The commonly cited ""50% range loss in winter"" is a worst case scenario. One where an equivalent ICE truck would get a ~30% reduction in fuel economy. Cold air is denser and takes more energy to drive through. The cold temperatures also reduces the air pressure in the tires, increasing rolling resistance. The means of propulsion doesn't change those two effects. The additional reduction in efficiency of an EV in the cold has to do with the need to generate heating independent of propulsion. While heat pumps can reduce the energy consumption of heating during mild temperatures (between -10C to +10C), the energy draw is more noticeable at colder temperatures (-30C or colder). Though, at those colder temperatures, you're hoping that your truck is plugged in and that the block heater is working. EVs don't have that worry. EVs also have thermally managed batteries that limit the temperatures of the pack and thus ensure that energy density doesn't drop too much.

Battery replacements are generally not an aspect of EV maintenance. The batteries in most EVs sold today are expected to last the life of the vehicle. Most manufacturers have 8 year/160k in warranties on the battery. Sure early Nissan Leafs and other short range EVs see greater degradation, but that's because those batteries were smaller and lacked battery thermal conditioning common on most EVs today (all except Leaf pretty much). Most EVs that have surpassed the 250k km mark typically only see a 10%-15% capacity (or range) reduction. In the future, as batteries and range gets bigger (+500km on a charge), one can expect batteries to last even longer.

C) OBD2 standard is not going away anytime soon. EVs aren't going to change that. Tesla may be making it harder to diagnose their vehicles (still use OBD2 protocol just changed the port and hid it under the seat), but most automakers are still providing OBD2 ports in their EVs and I don't see this changing without automakers getting fined massively by US and/or EU regulators. It's a requirement that cars made from 1996 and beyond adopt the OBD2 standard (in the US). Unless those laws change, you'll always be able to look up trouble codes in your car EV or ICE.",t2_n5c58,Knoexius,0,1648974011.0,0,t1_i379gj7,i379gj7,False,solEEnoid,t3_tura1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tura1t/13_of_new_car_sales_in_bc_in_2021_were/,13% of new car sales in BC in 2021 were electric-battery models,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tura1t/13_of_new_car_sales_in_bc_in_2021_were/i379gj7/,1,r/britishcolumbia,0,1

"Have you looked at the bc tenancy rules at all? Like even glanced at them?

You literally cannot force a tenant out of the place they’re renting by yourself with physical means, and you can’t hire a goon to do so either - at least, not a goon off the street.

The only way to actually get the tenant to leave, after they’ve been successfully evicted and they’ve chosen to still stay, is to go get a writ of possession from court. When you have that, you can then get a bailiff, your legally hired goon, to come remove the tenant by whatever means necessary. This runs people like $1000.

"I knew someone who tied up his dog in the back of a truck, with a rope long enough for him to jump out. I’ll spare the details other than that the dog lived. And that was a pickup bed with canopy. I repeat, I’d call 911.

Is it exactly what the line was designed for? Perhaps not, but it’s a crime where the welfare of an animal is presently at risk. As opposed to a vehicle break-in to get a file number for insurance, for instance.

Edit: was curious about conditions where this might be okay (closed canopy, camper etc)- first result on the BCSPCA site:

​I saw a dog in the back of a pick-up truck, what do I do?
Section 72 of the BC Motor Vehicle Act and Section 9.3 of the PCA Act prohibit the transport of an unsecured pet in the back of a pick-up truck. It is against the law and dangerous for a pet.

If you see a dog that is unattached in the back of a pick-up truck, call 911. Record the information about the vehicle so that you have it on hand for your call:

"As a paralegal you are completely not capable of making that diagnosis. As a paralegal you probably also didn’t take a lot of statistics. If you feel that malingerers were that prevalent and obvious at your firm you probably worked for a law firm in Surrey where there is a high-level of people and lawyers taking advantage of ICBC.  Even then, nowhere close to 40 to 50% of people involved in car accidents ever even make it to a law office. Of the ones that make it, far less than 50% are malingering.  So of all persons involved in car accidents, you would still get less than 15%.  Anecdotal evidence, by paralegals thankfully does not hold up in court.

Is this exact kind of attitude and overconfidence that lead to so many cases going to court. Judges then, supposedly with better judgement the most paralegals, often sided with the plaintive, leading to a high percentage of losses for ICBC defence lawyers. Which is the crux of the problem.

"I'd imagine in the extreme case where ICBC goes against the victims doctors they would have a tough road ahead.

To one of the posters above, it's definitely saved ICBC money it's not a 'supposedly'.

I would imagine the reality is the small and medium sized claims are far cheaper and outcomes some better off some worse off.  To what % we probably don't have eny data to even know.  For the worst most complex accidents/injuries.  The ICBC payouts are vastly less.  I'm not questioning the care as ICBC in theory would pay for all care, but in a case of someone who can no longer work in a field who makes a lot of money or especially didn't not yet make a lot but potentially /likely would the new system severely limits ICBC liabilities.  This gets passed onto such people needing to have robust extended benefits.  Now it's likely they may, but of could some will not and be screwed.  Mind you if we just take the ICBC savings and out those into benefits I'd imagine would end up with much better benefit over all.  Maybe that is the point.

Another interesting case I just thought of would be  somone who makes good money who has taken time off out of the workforce to raise a kid.  Let's say they have made zero in the last year or few.

"There is also cases of not purposeful exaggerated claims but simply personal injury lawyers are generally good at their jobs.  Given that they over time push judgements.  Our legal system of past cases being used, means any good lawyers find the cases where a ruling went a little further.  Over time these build up.  I understand if we lookmat similar injuries over the last 20 years the payouts increased much more than inflation.  Having an adversarial system has its positives and negatives.  For the vast number of cases I like the new system.  For big accidents and serious life altering cases one probably needs to figure out to self advocate or otherwise hire someone to help them navigate the system.  

There's also a huge difference in how pay outs work and what is accounted for that I've not seen mentioned.  Payments are 90% of current pay.  There is also a cap not much over 6 figures.  If you are in an accident and can never work again and make say entry level for a lawyer.  You get 90%.  No accounting for future increased earning that is clearly likely.  Previous I do not believe there was the 90%, no total cap and had every ability to argue loss of enjoyment of one's life and lifestyle.  Gone is all the grey area and it's pretty simple math now.  Better make sure you have extended benefits topped up!

The real issue with the changes is it also means companies around the roads cannot be sued either.  Some contractor doing road maintenance sets the fines up wrong and causes an accident, can't be sued which it's crazy.  That company has a CGL policy which shot be paying out not ICBC.

"""Affordable"" is a complicated equation here.  Housing is irrationally expensive almost everywhere in B.C.  Anywhere that most people would want to move to anyway.  If you're not working on a pipeline, or a big industrial project.  Some niche technological/engineering thing...  You probably don't ""need"" to move to Northern B.C.  If you like wide open spaces.  Scenery and wildlife.  Hunting, fishing and such.  Sure.  Otherwise, it's probably not for you.

Unless you stumble upon something by coincidence, make some friends somewhere, or figure out some kind of special arrangement (reduced rent for property management or something...) then you're not getting any housing deals.  You should definitely make peace with this before you start packing.

If it were me, I'd be looking for a location with as many amenities within walking distance as possible.  Working from home and not driving everywhere is going to be your biggest advantage, especially in absurdly priced, car dependent communities like Kelowna a.k.a The Jacksonville, FL of Canada.  I suggest that you leverage this at every opportunity.

Your housing is just half the picture.  Everything here is just a little more expensive.  Every day nickel and dime expenses.  Time and fuel spent in traffic.  Parking.  That last minute trip to the across town grocery store because the local, organic, artisanal, farm to table whatever wants $50 for some magic cheese slices or some bullshit...  These things will creep up over time.  Always consider this when you're comparing housing costs and locations.  That $100-$200 that you think you're saving?

"The Supreme Court of British Columbia is the province's superior trial court. The Supreme Court is a court of general and inherent jurisdiction which means that it can hear any type of case, civil or criminal. It hears most appeals from the Provincial Court in civil and criminal cases and appeals from arbitrations. A party may appeal a decision of the Supreme Court to the Court of Appeal.

That’s from their own website. I imagine you are a lawyer. The government passes a law which some would appeal, however the body of the law contains clauses which say that by nature of the same law one cannot appeal in certain circumstances or over a certain area. That’s a provincial legislature making a rule (Crown of BC) which regardless of the rule set out does not apply to superior courts (Crown of Canada). The law in question will be appealed one day on a case of clear inequity, and the superior court will vacate whatever portion of the law they decide is not compatible with equitable rulings of the court.",t2_2udaui41,Strudel-Cutie-4427,0,1648949933.0,0,t1_i366hqq,i366hqq,False,DedReerConformist,t3_tunf66,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tunf66/can_you_sue_after_an_accident_in_bc_response_from/,Can you sue after an accident in BC?

"Here's an answer from a lawyer who started in personal injury.

Most of them are still doing personal injury, claims take awhile to go through and existing claims from before the change over are still ongoing. It will probably take 5 years for that work to go away. In the meantime those firms are working on shifting practice areas. Personal injury is still just civil litigation so the skills are transferable. I'm seeing a far amount try to get into estate litigation because its an area that still allows for contingencies, although I suspect that will end if too many start doing it.

"Did you read what I posted?  What you posted is actually by a defence lawyer. Do you think they are any less biased? I work with people with chronic pain on a daily basis and I can tell you that very few meet the actual criteria for malingering. Those are caught out by forensic psychiaty and the percentage of IMEs that actually have malingering as a diagnosis by forensic psychiatrist is approximately 15% at best. Anyway you clearly have your own biases as a do I.  Let’s see how this all plays out over the next few years. I’m quite sure that in approximately five years we will go back to tort law, as ICBC in the end is completely inadequate at the proper diagnosis and treatment coverage for those with actual profound injuries.

I do find it quite funny that I posted an actual article, and you post a blog by a fucking defence lawyer.

The fact is that almost all the studies produced by the insurance bureaus in North America do not actually use the DSM four or five criteria for malingering. These use completely biased criteria. When the actual criteria is implemented, the percentage goes down dramatically. I worked for many years for both defence and plaintive sides, and everyone’s worried about the ambulance chasers, but by far the most difficult argumentative lawyers were the lawyers for ICBC who did not take a diagnosis or recommendations by actual specialists unless they agreed with their preconceived ideas.

"That study is about Malingering as a psychological disorder, NOT fraud.  

“Malingering should be distinguished from fraud. Malingering assumes that there is actually a compensable injury, but that the patient “lingers” in his care to receive additional benefits. Fraud is outright deception in order to receive benefits that are not due to a patient. While malingering may be a type of fraud, depending on the patient’s conscious decision to continue care, malingering originates from an initial, compensable injury.”

"Fraud is one thing, but exaggerated claims are quite another, and the latter was essentially impossible to weed out. And it was way way more prevalent than most people know.

Yes my original post was simplied in the sense that im not trying to break down the specifics of a case i worked on and identify myself or that case, but from spending hundreds of hours working that case I can tell you that even if the plaintiff were to be believed (which she shouldn't be, as she was caught in many lies on the witness stand), the main change in her life due to the accident was playing less tennis. And for that she got over $200,000.

MVA litigation in BC is a very different beast than any other type of litigation here. A lot of that has to do with the special case presented by the very existence of ICBC and is beyond the scope of what im prepared to discuss here, but I think even as a practicing BC lawyer you'd be shocked at the kind of money that gets handed out to people if you were working these files on a regular basis.

"Actual BC lawyer here as well. If you are unaware of cases like that, I question how much MVA law you actually know. 

To break down that case further: she got $110,000 for non pecuniary damages based on completely subjective injuries and the judge specifically cited her inability to play as much tennis in the judgment. 

During the plaintiffs two day testimony at trial she spent probably 70 percent of that time talking about tennis 
 
She also got damages awarded based on having to pay a dog walker more often that she used to. 

She got future care awared for massage and physio at several thousand dollars per year for her completely subjective injury. 

This case was hardly exceptional. In some cases with similar facts, the plaintiff will have deserved every penny. In many, many other cases, and in the one im referencing, the public got fleeced to pay a dishonest plaintiff and their lawyer based on a broken system.

I have some knowledge of the case I'm talking about beyond what's in the public  judgment of course, and every MVA lawyer has many stories like this. It's not always so obvious to the public how broken the system is because they don't usually get to see the worst parts of it. But this is not some one-off anecdote.

"Your comment about determining fault shows you really don't know much about how that actually works at law. Dash cams aren't going to capture every relevant aspect of every crash. Fault will always be an issue.

And besides that - assigning fault isn't the only problem with the old system. When you have to proactively predict someone's losses for an indefinite period of time and pay them out on that basis, it will always be a somewhat arbitrary and inaccurate process. There is literally a phrase that judges cite from a case that is used as authority for determining someone's future capacity loss: ""gazing into the crystal ball"". Does that sound like a good way to determine how much money should come out of the pockets of everyone who pays into insurance? 

With the new system, the idea is that regardless of who was at fault, you will get certain things paid for to help you recover, and they are paid as you incur those expenses. Instead of a judge having to guess how many  physio appointments you need for the rest of your life, or how many hours of work you will miss, you get reimbursed as those expenses are incurred.

Is it ideal to limit legal recourse? No

"I read your comment and you're repeating yourself suggesting this is normal. I'm sorry to disappoint you sir but suggesting people have their legal rights revoked isn't a sound argument, and shouldn't be viewed as ""normal"" in a democratic society, Omar.

When dash cams are under $100 and are commonplace is makes more sense to push these to the public... the days of wondering who is at fault are over.

And yes, It is a shocking turn of events. You're making light of the fact that people have had their legal rights diluted and have no more right to sue.

Governments exist to further the societal ideals of their citizens. Those ideals are usually based on the democratic fundamentals of fraternity, equality, and liberty. Any government who reduces the power of their citizens within these realms isn't serving the public interest and will likely be replaced by one that will.

Edit: and as an aside, I have sued an insurance company before, and won. It was not an auto accident- but cannot imagine how screwed I would have been if I didn't have legal rights to protect me. The insurance company tried to low ball me with 0%, 2%, and 10% offers of what they ended up settling for.

"After re reading, it’s his words that are saying that, so it’s up to that discretion. 

But he says “they found me to be partly responsible due to not being insured”


And no, that’s not how that works, I’ve been hit by a car on my bike. It was straight up that persons fault, the insurance co never looked my way, it was entirely paid for by their insurance. My bicycle isn’t insured. 


And unless the cyclist did something that explicitly caused the accident, which again, his words, isn’t the case. It wouldn’t work that way either. 


So, as another user mentioned- something fishy is up, but if his story is right and the other driver blew through a stop sign, there is zero reason a cyclist getting hit should be getting looked at to cover any damages at all - provided the story is as represented.

"> and the Crown is releasing the perp almost immediately. Our criminal justice system is currently failing at the court level

No, it isn’t. The prison system is no place for the mentally ill.

The government failed our society in the early 80s when conservative governments across Canada de-funded our networks of mental health institutions and sanitoriums in order to swell the ranks of their own electorate. And it worked, almost too well.

Unfortunately, when voting was opened up to the incarcerated and institutionalized in the late 80s, the mental health system was not re-implemented. So these mentally ill people stayed on the streets and in our society instead of being moved into institutions that could properly take care of them.

Any society should be measured by how it treats its weakest and most vulnerable members. And in that respect, Canada _is_ failing when it fails to institutionalize these people.

"Doing damage and not leaving a note is a crime. If the cyclist had left a note, it should be covered under the driver's comprehensive insurance like hail damage would, and the cyclist pays the set deductible. 

By 'public highway' I assume you mean any road, and by 'on' I assume you mean on the road in any capacity - so I guess you want everyone to be forced to carry liability insurance for the right to walk around in society - not something I want to see. I prefer for people who choose to take the financial risk and get the benefits to pay the insurance costs.

The 15k road bike example, since you were driving when you crushed it, your liability insurance would cover the damage and they'd get a new 15k bike. If you damaged it on purpose in another way, that's a crime. If damaged by accident another way, it's the owner's responsibility to have insurance to cover risks to their asset they chose to purchase. The person that damaged it would pay the set deductible and the owner would still get a new 15k bike.

"Because of subjective injuries, which make up the vast majority of claims. It's all well and good to get money cause you can't work on your broken leg, with x-rays to prove it.

Very different story when no doctor can find anything objectively wrong with you, but you get tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars because you stick with your ""my back is sore"" story for a long enough time. A plaintiff simply saying that in court does count as evidence and bc courts have been hugely biased against icbc for decades. And lawyers know how to play the game to get money for their clients and themselves in those borderline cases. 

Some people legit get a sore back that persists after a minor accident, and deserve some compensation. But if you understood how many of those claims get huge money  and how scant the evidence is in so many of them, you'd be sick. That's your money paying for some dude who decides to take an early retirement after getting rear ended at 8 kms per hour in a parking lot and complains his back is still sore because of it 10 years later

Real story: did a trial where a wealthy North van housewife got $200k++  EDIT: IN LARGE PART because she couldn't play as much tennis at her country club as she used to because of her completely subjective sore back and neck. Zero objective medical evidence. Doctors are part of the problem. They often are hired guns who basically will say what their side pays them to say under the guise of 'objective' expert reports. This really isn't a controversial opinion either - every personal injury lawyer in BC knows this. Not to say all doctors/experts are bad, but if you want to find one who will support your case, you can, easily.

"If you're into hiking, maybe get an Airbnb in Squamish. The drive north from Vancouver to Squamish is awesome. A little hard to keep your eyes on the road at times. Squamish is not a city, it's a town, but it's got a few cool spots and a lot of great outdoors stuff. Tons of hikes right around it. The Chief is the most popular for sure, and it can get busy, but the view is awesome. Similarly, if you're bent on staying in Vancouver look for something on the North Shore (North Vancouver) and do a hike up Grouse (just avoid The Grouse Grind…take one of the other trails like the BCMC (if you're a little more adventurous and know how to use map apps look for one that's called something like F… & F… just don't go when it's raining as you have to scramble up some steep rock sections). The nice thing about Grouse is that there are restaurants at the top and you'll be able to get some food and a beer…well, your partner will be able to get a beer and you can watch her drink it ; ) The view of the city from there is fucking spectacular. I hate Grouse, but the view…it's worth it if you haven't been up there. The other local mountains have a similar view, but not quite as good and you can't see it from their restaurants. Actually, in Squamish you can hike up to the Squamish Gondola upper station and have the same there. The food isn't great, but it's alright and the view makes up for it. Seriously, consider squamish. The drive really is awesome. You'll be able to get weed there too, and the hikes are great.

"> What else can they do besides trying to strike a balance to appease the greatest number of interested parties? How would you propose assigning permanent curtailments based on a GIS exercise?

I think that appeasing interested parties is an impossible task and sets an impossible standard, especially as we move forward with Indigenous management of resources on their territories. We can sit here for the next 100 years trying to find a common solution between First Nations across the province in wildly varying states of economic disparity/prosperity, but one doesn't exist. There is no middle ground to be found here, we just need to decide what our industry should look like and move to it. Do we want to turn the province into tree farms, or do we want to focus on conservation of wildlife values? Either is a valid management strategy, but it's clear that we can't do both as we currently do it. 

I've worked under the GBRO and think it provides a good, understandable framework for protecting what needs to be protected. I'm not saying that one GIS exercise can just provide an answer, especially since the government's data is so garbage. But if you want to conserve old growth, as it seems the direction is, then it's not hard to say ""don't cut trees over 200 years old on the coast or 100 years old in the interior"" and let the cards fall where they fall. 

I'm not saying that these are easy issues to deal with, of that they should be lightly considered. I'm saying that the ministry (which I've worked for before) isn't properly equipped to deal with these issues and is trying way too hard to make happy decisions for everyone.

If icbc didn't do that, your insurance premiums would be even higher because ultimately that money comes from you and me.

With a no fault system, those people will still get lots of compensation. Their medical bills and related expenses will be paid for. The unfortunate reality is that there's no such thing as a perfect system and yes, the most severe injury cases do stand to lose the most with the new system compared to the old. But for every one of those cases there were hundreds of people (and their lawyers) cashing in HUGE on the old system without really deserving or needing it, and again that's your money they were getting.

"I can't imagine how exhausting and excruciating it is for you. I was hit twice in 2019 (after they put the cap for minor injury in place), first time as a pedestrian second time as a passenger. concussion on top of concussion among other injuries at 25 yo with no physical health problem at the time, was pretty much just starting my career and 2 weeks into a new and exciting job. Now i struggle so much just trying to do the very basics with chronic pain every fucking day, haven't been able to show up to work on time for 3 years now and no one thinks I'm reliable, not even sure how I'm not fired yet. Neither accidents should have ever happened, it's solely because of distracted driving. For a while I'd get so angry and frustrated I'd go out at night and just walk for hours playing Pokemon Go because if i stopped I'd burst with rage.

My first adjuster was a dick and I'd lose my mind and start screaming into the phone till I finally just stopped picking up for a good while. He tried to offer me $5,500 for BOTH accidents, accused me of playing games when I just tried to figure out exactly what information I'd be releasing by signing whatever forms he was trying to get me to sign. Soon after he said oh it would be $5,500 each but refused to even consider it's not minor (could not work full time for a year and half, had no energy to cook or do barely any chores. still struggling to do a combination of these things now.) I WISH I had the capacity to play games with them, it's such blatant projection onto me of what they were doing. He told me ""you're not special"" and ""even if you get a lawyer they can't change this, it's the law"". He was right, I talked to half a dozen lawyers and they didn't think they can get me more compensation but still wanted me to hire them and pay 30%. So before my two year mark was up I took them to the CRT where they finally recognised that it's not minor injuries and offered a bit more, but really not much. but at least I can choose to fight them (or take the low ball, save myself some sanity and try to move forward with recovery.)

Do you have someone in your life that can help you with the daily stuff? I don't and I think it would really help. Would they pay for someone to help with house work and such? Honestly the people who are in favour of this legislation have never experienced physical trauma or are so privileged the compensation wouldn't make any difference to their life. I don't understand how it's constitutional to take away people's right to fight for compensation for devastating life changes at no fault of their own. I'm no lawyer but it seems that they're basically overriding Tort law. I don't understand why people drive as if their lack of care can't be life altering for some innocent stranger passing by. I don't understand why there's no fine, no charges, no consequence to these drivers. These employees, decision makers, politicians, law makers must have sold their souls to be doing this to people.

If you don't want to fight or report to the media, I fully support you because I've had a small slice of what you're suffering through. If you do choose to do either or both, I fully support you because I'm so angry with these people fucking up others' lives and then treat them like their life is worth shit. I'm not one to talk but we must try to be patient with ourselves and be diligent with activities that help recovery.

"Each example is different. In the truck example you'd be covered by your liability insurance that you're required to have because driving is inherently a bit dangerous to others and it'd cover normal damage. If that fence was coated with gold or something and was worth 10 million, I don't think you should be on the hook for the fact that that's more than your liability limit, no. 

The Iphone example, you actively chose to borrow the phone and personally benefit from it, so replacing it in kind is on you. 

If you smash a window on purpose, that's a crime; if it was an accident and you're a pedestrian, the owner's insurance should take care of it as a comprehensive claim (or homeowner's insurance if it's a house window) and maybe you pay the deductible, but not a varying amount depending on the fanciness of the window, no.

> Unfortunately, this strategy of contesting a plaintiff’s claim, and forcing a plaintiff to proceed to trial, in an effective game of chicken, is not confined to this case: this judge alone has presided over at least one other recent trial with minimal evidence, minimal cross-examination, and minimal argument, presented by the provincial automobile insurer qua defendant. [1]

> [6]         Of course, it is the defendant’s right to force the plaintiff to prove her case, and the defendant is not required to adduce any evidence at all. One may question whether the provincial insurer is penny-wise and pound-foolish by advancing such a strategy in the face of a $1.7 million claim, which cost will ultimately be borne by British Columbians if the plaintiff is successful. But I reiterate that such a strategy makes the task of the Court exceedingly difficult, and undermines its truth-finding function.

"This is difficult and will likely end up with some significant litigation. 

They find that he is partly at fault because he was uninsured and therefore should not have existed on the road. 

That line is somewhat flawed for a number of reasons. Mostly that at the end of the day, he was there, the other driver still proceeded through a signal without ensuring it was clear. 

The issue with part fault due to administration or clerical level, is that the operator of the vehicle didn’t operate the vehicle in any way to contribute to the accident- like going through a signal they shouldn’t have, or initiating a turn, then halfway through changing their mind or something, or changing lanes improper etc. 

They aren’t actually performing a maneuver that contributed. But with actual cars- there is reason to say they shouldn’t be driving because that particular vehicle wasn’t road legal. 

However with a bicycle, there is, as far as I am aware, no clear legislation that requires insuring a bike. No licensing, no training, nothing. 

Not to mention- minors can’t insure yet are still able, or sometimes required to operate cycles on the road. 

“What if” clauses often have some very difficult traction, “he wasn’t insured, shouldn’t have been there” is not totally true, as “if he was insured, he would have been” or “if he was a teenager, he’d have been there”. 


It’s not a fine for not being insured, but it effectively is, because he’s being punished for not having something that isn’t clear is required. 


This opens up a lot of problematic situations too, and sets a pretty horrible precedent. The car driver went through a stop sign without ensuring it was clear or not. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter because it could have been anyone occupying that space, in any type of vehicle. 

This wouldn’t be a discussion if it was someone in a mobility scooter for example. And depending on the conditions which the driver went through the sign, it might not have mattered if they were on the road or the sidewalk.  Like if they straight up blew the sign at speed, and not just proceeded from a stop. 

This also doesn’t really address the issues or questions I bring up. Only kind of leads to more.
