"Hi! I’ve recently moved to st Catherine’s and my experience has been nothing but great. My neighbours have been nice and welcoming and I’ve had positive interactions with others as well. 

I am also Latin American born. And so far I’ve not received any discrimination myself nor have I witnessed it. I obviously can’t speak for everyone but that has been my experience. 

Lastly, I have seen plenty of Latin restaurants around, a Latin market, and a Hispanic church. So 
I feel like there’s plenty of Latin immigrants living in st Catherine’s too. 

I will say one “negative”. Having lived in other Canadian cities before… I can say that there are a few areas where you can tell there’s a lot of drug use.

"I'm not sure I'd trust Google for a good recommendation for a gym, let alone a restaurant. I'd rather hear from people who have actually been there, or suggestions on what to order. Last time I used Google for a gym recommendation it was 4 out of 5 stars. I didn't know the missing star was because of used needles in the change room. When anyone can write a review, you can't really trust it's from a neutral party. There's nothing wrong with giving some small business a bit of a shoutout. They could use it after all the COVID restrictions nearly bankrupting a lot of them.

There is a influx of new residents though and I think the issue is people coming from Toronto etc don’t realize while Niagara Region is big it’s also not.

"Walk around St Paul st and you'll have plenty of great restaurants to choose from. 

Beechwood Donuts is a stellar

Merchant ale House is great for a beer. Microbrewery that has seasonal drinks.

East and Wind Sushi. Owned buly the same guy/company and actually right next door to one another. It sushi. It's good.

Oddbird. Been once and really good chicken burger

Pho Dua Bo is a really great Vietnamese restaurant that makes some amazing pho

Not in st Catharines downtown core but Carrsons Pizza near the allenburg bridge is fucking dynamite. Less of a greasy night out drinking pizza and more of just a really amazing pizza. Peasano, and Pete's pizza are good for your greasy pizza an wings.

St. Josephs Bakery on Facer st. I went to school at St. Joseph back when that existed next door to the bakery and my childhood was filled with saving up loose change and buying some plum pazci at the bakery. It's a small polish bakery and deli. Great fresh bread and buns, homemade pierogies, cabbage rolls. 

Also want to mention Polania in Niagara falls. Opened recently and another amazing Polish deli/bakery. Probably the best cabbage rolls I've ever had that weren't homemade. More meat than rice.

Richards fine meats butcher shoppe on Lakeshore road has a BBQ every Saturday that changes weekly. Sausage, burgers, peameal bacon, rib eye steak, roast beef on a bun. All great and have great selection of meats.

Preston Pies. Recently discovered them. They make a load of different English pies. Steak, Liver, chicken pot pie all of them are amazing. They also do dessert pies aswell.

Go out and discover some though.

"Congratulations on your child and on doing the responsible thing by having a will. I used Yar Diduch at whatever Lancaster, Brooks and Welch is called now. Avoid Paul Bauerle at the former Chown Cairns. He is everything that gives lawyers a bad name. My wife and I joke that if we get divorced, whomever makes the decision to divorce the other has to use Paul. It helps keep us married. 

Just a heads-up that unless you have very specific and unique circumstances, pretty well any will drawn up by any lawyer will actually be boilerplate from legal software as opposed to crafted for you.

In most cases, wills are matching: if you die first, your wife gets everything. If your wife dies first, you get everything and if you both die, it goes to some third party. 

My advice is to create a ranked list of parties for custody of the kids. This occurred to us when we were on holiday with my wife's brother and his wife. That if our jeep went off the very steep Costa Rican jungle road we were driving on, the instructions we left would be moot as we were each other's designated custodians. When we got back, we revised the will to reflect that custody should go to the highest ranked party who was willing to accept custody. My wife's younger brother and his wife, my sister and her husband, my wife's older brother and his wife, my wife's parents.

With us, there wasn't any insult or slight by naming the parties in the order we did because it was primarily about distance and the relationship/familiarity our kids have with their families.",t2_xt5l3,EtOHMartini,0,1648477611.0,0,t1_i2fvuje,i2fvuje,True,Shrimp_Smuggler,t3_tq8ib8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tq8ib8/looking_for_estate_lawyer_reccomendations/,Looking for Estate Lawyer Reccomendations,/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tq8ib8/looking_for_estate_lawyer_reccomendations/i2fvuje/,4,r/stcatharinesON,0,4

Well that’s not bad however at 7 lb per paver ( old style ) 150 weigh 1050 lbs . That’s over the max weight allowable in a 1/2 ton Van . 200 = 1400 lb . Over weight by 400 lbs ! Plus you are not doing yourself any good wrecking your vehicle. My message know what you are dealing with . Most vans are 1/2 ton so moving 150 pavers is already over the limit. 3/4 ton van will allow you to transport 215 pavers . Same limits apply to a truck . Bottomline pavers are heavy - not the easiest to transport or install or remove. To note 7 lbs per paver is on average the weight of 4 in. x 8 in. x 3 1/4 . Some this size can be heavier. Newer pavers can be 4x8 but 2 in thick on average those weigh 5 1/4 lbs . Thinner pavers are not usually used on driveways. I’ve done my fair share of paver jobs over the years .

"Unbelievably reckless.

There was a vehicle what was doing that every morning at the same time at the corner of Willowdale and Westchester. This was about two years ago and Old Glenridge residents started recording it. Eventually the cops got wise and waited to catch them. 

Damn if I don't think that is the same vehicle.

Did you notice if it was a middle aged woman?

"That is many of the rules/laws/by-laws though.  There are not enough people for enforcement of every single line item (be it by-law, MNR, NRP, OPP, RCMP, etc).

The previous company obviously did not care for their health and safety record or the health of their employees (and I assumed every company was like that until I joined a company that requires extensive courses to be taken around this).  The new company obviously cares about their workers (or cares more than the previous company) and this could be a legitimate care, or it could be because any injury claims would impact their insurances, so they are giving people (more or some) training on what is acceptable and what they can decline and won't get in trouble for because they don't need anyone to get hurt.

Garbage cans are not standardized and this is a part of the issue.  A training program can be created but it can't be designed to fit every type of can people are putting at the curb because of the large difference in how they all operate/open or how they are designed to be lifted.

You mention the expectation is the collectors are lifting the bags out of the bins, but that takes more time than just lifting the bin and tipping it, especially if you need to fight with some type of vacuum seal that was created.  Also there are no requirements on garbage bag grades, so doing this with someone using the cheapest option will potentially result in the bag ripping and now there is a mess that people will complain about that they should have cleaned up.  Most people have no clue as to weight limits of the bags being used to start, just put stuff into it until it is full or it is garbage day.  Also lifting a bag out of a can increases the chances of getting nicked with something sharp with how the bag will swing.",t2_4mypp7mg,The-Raccoon-Is-Here,0,1648140857.0,0,t1_i1y9rj6,i1y9rj6,False,peptide2,t3_tm4waf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tm4waf/is_a_by_law_not_enforced_for_13_years_really/,Is a by law not enforced for 13 years really necessary?,/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tm4waf/is_a_by_law_not_enforced_for_13_years_really/i1y9rj6/,6,r/stcatharinesON,0,6

"Hi!

I’m not sure if you are male or female, but “Niagara Rec sports” has coed soccer leagues during the summer at various skill levels. Normally Sunday afternoon/evening games. You can register as an individual and be added to a team, or you can register an entire team.

If you are female, St. Catharines Jets has a recreational women’s division that plays Friday nights. You can register as an individual in this league as well. This is the league I play in every summer - it’s a lot of fun. Great mix of soccer and camaraderie. 

Both leagues have a cost to register, but the games have referees, are on decent city owned fields and you will get a jersey.
