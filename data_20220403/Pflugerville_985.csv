"Hi! I moved here from SD too! Pf is very homebody vibes and everything is nearby via car. More of a suburbs area; quiet and calm. Must need a car to get around. It's not to far from DT Austin or Round Rock for a night out. 

You can definitely rent a home for under 3k but just look more into rent laws here as there isn't any rent control, so definitely recommend doing a longer lease if that lowers the cost. Utilities ~ you get to pick your electric company at most places. 

Also make sure to get heartworm prevention asap for you pets since it's very common here in Texas. You'll need to get a pet license (yearly/or even 3 years).

Change your license plate asap. More drivers are willing to let you in afterwards 🙃. Learn more about frontage roads and be prepared to drive 50-60mph constantly. 

Food wise: Asian and BBQ food very popular. Mexican food is okay, better in San Antonio.

"I moved here 4 years ago to raise a family. That's why I picked Pflugerville. If I didn't want a moderately priced home in a nice neighborhood to raise kids, I would have definitely gone somewhere else in Austin.

There is so much beautiful/natural space to the west of the city and there's actual excitement in the city. I said 30 minutes of traffic wouldn't stop me from enjoying the city, and it really didn't until I had kids, but that unpredictable 40-70 minute commute twice a day can really weigh on you after a while (even with autopilot).

"Green Mountain and Infuse Energy are the two that we've had that do buyback of excess solar at retail rate rather than wholesale rates.

Green Mountain only does month to month billing for their solar programs, which for us was a problem since that means they can change our electricity rates at the endnof each month, our per kWh rate went up by about 25% over the last year that we had them as out electric provider. 

We have Infuse Energy right now on a 3yr contract, they do solar buyback at retail but do not have rollover of solar credit. Thats becoming normal now though, we had Green Mountain previously but they ended their rollover of solar credits at the beginning of the year, so the credit resets at the end of billing cycle. 

Infuse has better contract terms for people that have systems that don't fully offset their electric use than Green Mountain does. Our contract has free nights 9pm to 6am, since we have 2 electric cars we could never fully offset out electric usage with Green Mountain. But now we can charge the cars overnight when it is free and solar full offsets daytime use, so our bills have been $0 since switching from Green Mountain.

"What part of Austin will you work?

I lived in Austin until I was 12 and in Pflugerville for the rest. I have a house and kids in Pflugerville now. Honestly if my whole family wasn't here already I think I'd rather live on the west side of Austin. Most younger people like to live in south Austin or Central Austin. For 3000 a month you can rent most places in austin. Some brand new apartments are getting thrown up at Avery ranch and 183 look nice. One of my coworkers moved from San Diego to an apartment in Lakeway that he loves even though it's a little out of the way.

I don't ever recommend Pflugerville to people who move here from other areas. If you want a bunch of space you need to move further out from Austin(leander georgetown hutto manor bastrop). If you want a more things to do you need to move closer to downtown(mueller area, apartments on lamar). If you want more nature and greenery you move to west Austin(cedar park, lakeway, leander). If you want to settle, save money, have a family, you move to Pflugerville, round rock, cedar park. Most people who come here aren't looking to settle right away and I feel like it's better to live closer to the excitement or in nature.",t2_yhsyf,bugieman2,0,1648177845.0,0,t1_i20qcuo,i20qcuo,True,yousmelllikeabakka,t3_tn6utg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pflugerville/comments/tn6utg/im_sure_you_see_these_a_lot_but_planning_a_move/,I’m sure you see these a lot but planning a move from CA to pflugerville,/r/Pflugerville/comments/tn6utg/im_sure_you_see_these_a_lot_but_planning_a_move/i20qcuo/,8,r/Pflugerville,0,8

">	So activists want police departments to literally look up skin color before making a traffic stop, so they can consult a statistics distribution chart and ensure that their searches exactly match area demographics?

It’s not difficult to understand that stop rates should be representative of the population if police are treating people equally, so they should do that.

Yes, I read all 30 pages of this desperate attempt to downplay these numbers. It isn’t at all surprising that police will report not being able to identify race prior to stops when there is mounting national pressure and evidence on racial bias.

Second, they held a standard that private EMS companies don’t even care to try and achieve: care about your patient. It didn’t matter if it was frequent flyer ****** and their 9th ride this week, or someone having what is known as a “true emergency”. Take care of your patient, and be there for them. Acadian (and whoever takes their place) SAY they do this, but they have no way to enforce this practice. They can’t keep their employees happy or even employed, so they never make it to caring for a patient. 

3rd, TCESD2 asked for $0.065 cents on $100 property valuation from the city to keep EMS services running smoothly. They’ll still bill you, just like Acadian, but there is a key difference, one the District *probably* doesn’t want me to say. If you get a bill from Acadian, and don’t pay it, they will come after you, HARD. Report you to credit agencies, hassle you over the phone and via email and snail mail. They’ll even sue you if they’re able. Pflugerville, however? They’ll send 3 notices. If you don’t pay after the 1st, they send a 2nd. Same thing? They send a 3rd. Still don’t pay? Ok. Written off as a loss. No reporting to credit, no coming after you, or suing you. Why can they do that? Tax dollars. Why don’t you get an itemized bill from pflugerville? Because they don’t care to collect. If you have the ability to pay, pay. If not…… 🤷🏼‍♂️. 

If there is a question as to why I left, it is because I am pursuing medical professions beyond that of ground paramedic. Otherwise, I would still work for that stellar department. 

The medicine, the health of the providers, the happiness of the providers, the ability of the providers, and the billing practices by pflugerville are ALL better than Acadian could ever hope to achieve. Case in point, Acadian is already backing out because they can’t fulfill the commitment (pflugerville city council will say it was mutual, but Acadian sent a letter of intent to discontinue services on 2/2/22). 

I loved working there. I miss it, daily. You the citizens were fantastic. The department was fantastic. The job was fantastic. 

Tell city council, and specifically David Rogers, that “response time” is the worst metric by which a provider should be measured (for the record, TCESD2’s response times are also stellar), and the inability of the council to measure anything else is their problem, and should not be passed to the citizens. 

I saved lives there. Literally.

"Fully reimbursable may be the wrong question. Perhaps a better question would be, ""Isn't ALS covered by most health care insurance providers?""

I don't think an EMS provider can charge more than the insurance negotiated rate.

"No, ALS is not fully reimbursable or at least its exceptionally rare for a person to have insurance to fully reimburse the whole bill. The privates (Arcadian and others) bill the individual customer directly at a much higher rate than a taxpayer funded option (Travis Co EMS). So the ""no additional cost"" is really them saying they are not taxpayer funded, ie ""hope you don't actually need them"" Generally, the privates don't even provide the higher level of care (ALS). Mostly, the lower level (BLS) and transport but they charge you $$$$ its the business model. 

History: 

  ESD2 is taxpayer funded only as a fire service but added EMS Service in the last decade. This added more service but obviously it costs more. The ALS EMS cost was going to over run the funding for fire in the near future so ESD2 explained it to the city. The solution was to created ESD17 to pay give the taxpayers the ability to make up for the coming shortfall. If the voters choose to they would be able to fund it, no need for the expensive unreliable privates. The city fought this and sued ESD17 for allowing Pflugerville voters the opportunity to vote...

The ESD is requesting more money for expansion. Call volume has increased every year. With population and call volume third party audits done by ESD 2 have shown they need to expand eastward and bolster ambulance coverage. 

ESD 2 was operating the ambulance service just fine outside of a budget issue. Projected forecasts (from a third party audit) showed that funds would run out in the near future and the fire department would then start operating in the negative with its current budget.

"The financials counted operating expenses for a station that hasn’t even been built yet. More than $5 million dollars in future operating expenses were already being shown as already spent. Also, how come other ESDs aren’t needing overlay districts?

It’s a shame you’re trying to make it out that city council and voters look down on first responders because they weren’t against the overlay district. That’s completely false and you’re just trying to make yourself a victim. Again, the anger and finger-pointing is misplaced. 

Lastly, you clearly have close ties to the ESD and you should disclose that relationship if it does, indeed, exist. Then again, we’ve already seem we can’t count on ESD leadership to operate ethically. 

Local politicians and voters chose not to throw more money at an ESD that has already proven they can’t manage money. Throwing more money at those who can’t manage it isn’t the solution. ESD leadership got us in this mess and city council is trying to navigate a shitty hand they were dealt.

"You're going to use ~21k kwh per year (based on the square footage), rounding up to 24k because it makes the math easier. So you want a plan that scales well for using more than 1000kwh per month.

Example 1: Constellation charges 10.9c per kwh no matter how much you use. You would expect a $218 power bill with them.

Example 2: Newpower is listed as the lowest cost at 8c per kwh, but the rate goes up as you buy more, up to 12.6c per kwh. You would expect a $252 power bill with them.

So you want a provider that has a fixed cost, because the ones that are variable-cost will charge more for large usage months.

"Doug Weiss posted about it in one of the Facebook groups back in May.  May 11 City Council meeting they approved starting eminent domain proceedings against KM Avalon LTD.

“This was approved at the city council meeting on 5/11 (two weeks ago). Eminent domain is when the government and the property owners cannot come to terms and the land has to be “taken” through a legal process in court. I’m under the impression that the amount was not in dispute, but added conditions were unreasonable. I understand that this lane is owned by the Avalon WCID and the homeowners association. Forcing the city to pursue this path is setting the project back about 4 more months.”

“I may have been mistaken about it being owned by the HOA. It looks like the developer still owns one of the parcels, and the other is owned by the WCID. You might need to check their board meetings. Have any residents been elected to the WCID board?”

"We moved here in August and Suddenlink slowly degraded from ""pretty bad"" to ""unusable."" We're talking disconnects every 5-10 minutes. This was especially bad because I was in the process of interviewing remotely for a new job.

The worst part is that my next door neighbor, whose service is connected to the same damn physical box between our houses, hasn't had any problems! It almost feels personal. 

I gave up and switched to T-mobile's 5G home service. It's not perfect, but every time I've called them they've been responsive and have actually done something to fix it.

"* Ensure you're going through the absolute minimum of home wiring and junctions
* No, seriously, the *absolute minimum*
* Replace the modem with a good one

When I got Suddenlink I was getting a spotty 40MBit. After a bunch of rather relentless optimization I'm now usually sitting in the 500-800MBit range depending on time of day.

The biggest part of this was the home wiring; originally, the cable came in through the cable box on the side of the house, then went into the home network where it went god-only-knows-where but suffice to say it was complicated. I ended up just manually running a coax cable straight from the junction box and under the garage door, then putting the modem in there, bypassing all of whatever the hell is happening in the house. At some point I'll drill a hole in the wall and shove the cable through there instead.

If you've got wiring issues in the house then this isn't their problem and they won't care, it's up to you to fix.",t2_2zpj0,ZorbaTHut,0,1642997959.0,0,t1_htz8kfq,htz8kfq,True,angoleiroc,t3_saz8gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pflugerville/comments/saz8gf/anything_better_than_suddenlink/,Anything better than Suddenlink?,/r/Pflugerville/comments/saz8gf/anything_better_than_suddenlink/htz8kfq/,2,r/Pflugerville,0,2

"I think that location closed, its a different auto service place now but I won't go to Kwik Kar anyways. I've been in Pflugerville for 3 yrs and they are the only place that has been outright shady. 

Stopped in to that location right after we moved up for an oil change. Asked the price when we were giving them our info, they said it was like $49.99, okay. While we were waiting I watched a tech pull the engine air filter out, drop it on the ground, hand it down to the guy working under the truck, then when he got it back brought it in to us saying there was oil in the filter from a possible manifold leak. 

I asked if the oil was there before he dropped it and handed it to the guy in the pit. He stumbled over that for a few seconds, I guess assuming we didn't see the whole exchange out in the bay, then said the oil might have been from that and walked back out to finish the oil change. 

Then they called us up to the counter and same guy that tried the filter thing rang us up and said the total before taxes or anything was $64.99, said we were told $49.99 when we got there, he said there was a $15.00 discount if you buy an airfilter as like a combo service thing. Asked him how much the airlifted was, suprise surprise it was $15.00.

Told him I wasn't going to pay the $64.99, asked for the manager and was told there wasn't one there at the time. I told him to hold on, so I walked out front and called their corporate number and asked for the location manager, they put me on hold for a minute then they transfer the call and I walk back inside and I hear  a phone ringing in an office behind the counter the same ringing I hear through my phone, guy picks up and I hear him answer from the office before I hear him through the phone. Tell the manager they have a problem and he needs to come up to the counter. He walks out visibly confused and I explain the issue, during this the first guy had gone back out to the garage. Manager opens the door to the garage to call the guy back in, talked to him off to the side for a minute then comes back over to us and apologizes, tells us he's going to have a good talk with the service tech and rings us up for the $49.99 oil change plus $5 off for the ""misunderstanding"".",t2_17235o,droids4evr,0,1642195629.0,0,t1_hsojs5z,hsojs5z,False,Terror-Tris,t3_s3wu73,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pflugerville/comments/s3wu73/inspection/,Inspection,/r/Pflugerville/comments/s3wu73/inspection/hsojs5z/,3,r/Pflugerville,0,3

"I've used Firestone in Stonehill plaza in the past without any issues, and will again.

I've had good luck in the past at the Firestone on i-35 next to Tinsle Town (for tire repairs, oil changes, inspections, and a new catalytic converter), but last year Firestone got rid of all of the employees/managers at that store (supposedly by reassigning them to other stores) because that store wasn't profitable enough. I've only had one dealing with the new staff (oil change on a 2020 Subaru) and it was fine...but I'm just hesitant to recommend them.

"> I have family here in Pville so I’m familar with the area but I’m worried I made the wrong decision since RR supposedly has a better school district and lower property taxes and Cedar Park/Leander are in a more desirable area for resale down the line + supposedly better school districts.

I'm told our schools are improving, so you might have gotten a deal based on their state today, plus you stand to benefit from the improvement on the resale side. The 130 corridor is blowing up, what with Samsung and Tesla and whatnot, so I think it's fair to say the investment value of a house here is excellent.

As for taxes, I can't argue with that. Williamson County is cheaper, has better schools today, and is undergoing a red-to-blue demographic shift that would make me feel like my vote mattered more, compared to solid-blue Travis County.

For me, though, the kicker is that in my little corner of Pflugerville (Wells Branch and Immanuel, barely even in town) I'm really close to my friends and family in Austin.

"We moved here from Austin when I was in 7th grade. I moved away for school and work for 6 years and came back and lived with my parents to save up for a house. They wanted to stay here. My realtor lives in cedar park and said west of Austin was better in general but we were used to this side of Austin.

Crazy part is we moved because my house(Amherst and duval) was zoned for Lanier(now navarro) high school at the time. But by the time I would've gone to Anderson high school and now that area is a more coveted area. My parents just said we have no idea how places will turn out in the future.

"Been in Austin for almost 9 years now and most of that time has been in the North part of town. We chose Pflugerville as it's still close to the city for when we want to go out and the price of new builds was more attractive than what was being sold in the city. To us, RR, CP and Leander were too far out - even though we don't really go into the city too often. 

My SO and I (mostly I) fell in love with the Blackhawk community. It's a very nice neighborhood with lots of diversity, green space, open roads and good space in between houses. Pflugerville overall is very green friendly and it's reflected in some of the city plans such as the 2030 master plan as well as the lake. Pflugerville (around 130, mostly East of it) is certainly behind in development in comparison to some of the other metro areas but it doesn't bother me too much as construction isn't slowing down and we'll continue to see new business, shopping, etc. come in. I wouldn't say it's less desirable seeing as how we're not too far from the Tesla Mega Factory and Samsung will be close to us as well. This will drive prices even higher.

In regards to the larger area we're just a 25 min highway drive away from most things surrounding the Austin metro which is nice. I wasn't too hung up on some of the things you listed as 1. DINKS 2. We're still young and probably (maybe?) won't call Pflugerville our forever home. For what its worth, several of our neighbors (some with children others without) have moved from Round Rock into our neighborhood. I could only assume they were making a pretty penny off their homes, becoming priced out, or the appeal of a new build was too great.

"They don't have rolls, just bagels but they make good sandwiches. They get their dough shipped from a place in Manhattan and bake it in the shop. It's the first real bagel I've had since we moved. I do Keto so I usually skip the bagel but get a sausage/egg/cheese on plate. I wish they'd expand and do egg salad, rolls, challah and some other bagel spot standards but we're happy to have the bagels for now.

My wife really likes a Jamaican place in town, Tony's.

Big Nonna's on Parmer and Tech Ridge has a really good pie, it's the closest I think we've had since moving and it's vegan(dairy allergies) but you couldn't tell. Toast the bottom a little bit and you're in business.

"Ooh I'd be really interested in that! I'm dying for an egg & cheese on a hard roll. As far as pizza goes...nothing comes close. Every time my mom has come down to visit I make her bring a few slices with her. There's a food truck outside of Celis Brewery and their pizza crust is *kind of* similar to NY. I have to agree with Iron Fish for sushi (though I still prefer my hometown places). Shogun is also pretty good. I've never really been a huge bagel person so I haven't tried any down here yet. Halal Brothers is really good if you like middle eastern food. By far, I'd say both my husband and I are obsessed with Inka Chicken. There's just something about that wood-fired flavor that is so good. Never heard of Nervous Charlie's... I'll have to look into it. If you don't mind me asking, where in NY are you from? 

Edit: Just an FYI...I don't know about you, but in NY I'd run into a pizza place to grab a slice and get one, maybe two pizza/pepperoni rolls...well the Growler gives you 8 I think. It's a meal in and of itself. My husband and I couldn't finish them between us.

"Local Favorites?  Here are my top 6:

1.  **Brotherton's Black Iron BBQ**  \- On the Top 50 BBQ places in Texas, creative sandwiches, and unique sausage offerings.  John Brotherton is a local philanthropist and rising star among the BBQ elite.  They sell out fast, so get there early.
2. **Oriental Kitchen** \- Serving both traditional and unique dishes, Meili Wu makes her little restaurant feel like home.  The Basil Fish and Green Beans will change your perspective on Asian food.  Also, if you don't see what you want on the menu, tell her what you are in the mood for and you might get a truly one-of-a-kind experience
3. **Iron Fish Sushi** \- Tucked away on the side of HEB, this unassuming little joint cranks out quality dishes that rival many of the high-end places in Austin.  Having tried everything on the menu (and then some), I can say that there is nothing bad that they serve.  Fresh, creative, delicious.  
4. **Huahuasco Grill Taqueria y Mas** \- Not your Abuela's regular Mexican food.  The chefs at HGTyM must have PhD's in flavor-ology because every bite is bursting with spices.  I find myself throwing a dart at the menu sometimes because it's just so hard to pick a favorite.
5. **Fogonero Restaurant** \- I don't know how they make most of the stuff at this newer Venezuelan place, but after the first bite; I don't care.  A fresh take on South American food, Fogonero sets the pace for quality with a homestyle feel.  I believe that everyone should try Venezuelan food once, then go back every week to try something new again.
6. **Larb Thai** \- A flagship/anchor of the Pville food trailer park, LT slings some legit Thai.  The crispy pad thai (spice level 5) will change your perspective on what can come out of a restaurant with wheels.   It's become our household ""comfort food that bites back"".

Honorable mentions:

 \- **Growler Bar** pizza rolls

 \- **Spare Time** Sunday Brunch (If they've addressed the service issues)

 \- **Curry Kitchen** Momos

 \- **Willards Brewery Food Trailer** Burgers (on Thursdays)
