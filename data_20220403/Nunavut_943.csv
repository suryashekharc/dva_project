Polar bears are dangerous, and coming face to face with one is never something that you would want.

Too many times inexperienced travellers have needed to be rescued in completely preventable situations, putting the lives of others at risk.

A solution would be to send them south to get certified. 

But there isnt enough people up north to fill all the construction roles. Although they might have vast knowledge about their unique situations, sometimes you need outside expertise brought in. 

None of that should mean that anyone is treated poorly. There is a way to utilize local talent and still bring in outside expertise.  There should be an exchange and sharing of information.

"Well I'm not going to try to claim there is *no oppression*, because it's hard to prove a negative. This idea of oppression being ""obvious"" to the oppressed sounds slippery, like, ""it's so obvious to *us* that we don't need to try to explain it, just take our word for it"".

The things you describe about the carpenter sounds like natural difficulties that would arise for anyone living in a small isolated community.

The reason we certify carpenters is to ensure that they are in fact skilled, it's not some plot to keep the Inuit down. It's probably exactly the same in any isolated community, if you want to be certified you'd have to travel to the city.

The way I imagine oppression is that it needs to be something intentional, not just like ""they aren't addressing challenges as good as we'd like"".

Iqaluit based here.

"The thing that's throwing me off is her upturned tail, her very narrow fox like face and her smaller pointed ears. I know German shepherds as I've grown up with them around and our previous pup was a German Shepherd Alaskan Malamute mix. Behaviorally she's very different from a German Shepherd. It's a long running joke that German shepherds and German Shepherd mixes come already trained and that was very much true for our late pup. They are very easy to train. Kinnsey however is providing to be incredibly difficult to train, she's too smart and too stubborn. She'll only consider doing something if she knows you have a treat, otherwise she'll ignore you and do what she wants. She also has no idea how to howl which is odd but our previous pup didn't either. 

She's got a shorter tail that reminds me of a Maned wolf where it looks a little disproportionate to her body and when she's happy and attentive it stands up high with a curl. 

The other thing is that her coat seems oddly thin for a dog mixed with a husky or even a German Shepherd, especially around her tummy but, she was nursing recently so that might be why. Her coat is absolutely stunning. Sometimes you look at it and wonder if it's wet it's so shiny! It literally sparkles! I wonder if she might get cold but if she is she won't allow up to put a vest or voltage on her because I bought her a Christmas bandana and cute little shirt and it was such a struggle getting then on and she instantly tried to rip them off with her claws and teeth. 

She's incredibly agile and high energy which reminds me of a border collie and she is roughly around 40 pounds. She's much smaller then a German Shepherd, she's a medium sized dog.",t2_5hvnl1gs,DreamerofBigThings,0,1640639104.0,0,t1_hq6y7zg,hq6y7zg,False,DreamerofBigThings,t3_rpue84,https://www.reddit.com/r/nunavut/comments/rpue84/this_is_kinnsey_whos_originally_from_kinngait_she/,This is Kinnsey who's originally from Kinngait.

"Hi, I hope you'll enjoy living in Iqaluit. I don't live there now but as a researcher working on the Polar Continental Shelf Project and later as a pilot got to spend time in Resolute Bay, Arctic Bay and Alert and had the chance to fly into all sorts of places including Eureka - even spent the night there- Northwestern Greenland including some scientific camps along the Robeson Channel and some enjoyable visits to Thule Air Base. I was in and out of Iqaluit and even flew a Medevac flight there.

I can't pass any great current tips about living in Iqaluit itself but a great resource - if I can recommend something on ""YouTube"" are the videos by Olivia Young who lived there for 2 years with her husband, a firefighter. Her vids will give you a greater insight into the place told by a ""southerner"".  Watch a few and you will get a feel for the place.

They have since returned to Ontario and most of her videos are two years old but they will give you a great insight to the town, the shopping, apartments, the dump, Canada day parades, how they get parcels (Canada Post had to establish a separate branch just to handle all the mail order stuff). Even her child was born there at the hospital. Just do a search on YouTube' s search function and you will find a whole series of them.  One of them is only a year old where they returned to Iqaluit to clear out their apartment, sell a bunch of stuff and pick up their dog to bring back south. It may even be a good one to start with.

"A couple of questions: Will your M.Ed. be (or include) a teaching credential? It would be helpful to have a teaching certificate before you apply. A Canadian teaching credential from any province or territory ( with or without a B.Ed. ) would be ideal to have. I am a retired Ontario principal and hold an M.Ed. But “in the day”, I got my teaching certificate before I completed my BA but never got a B.Ed. Degree.  

My second question has to do with citizenship. Is your mother a Canadian citizen or was born in Canada? If so, run to your closest Canadian consulate as you should have a claim to Canadian citizenship. 🇨🇦🇨🇦. My niece moved to the USA from Canada and married an American. Their daughter, was born in Miami. She is a dual Canada- US citizen and has both passports. Canadian citizenship would remove a real barrier to a teaching job anywhere in Canada., not just Nunavut.

">Petroleum hydrocarbons were discovered in the water.

 “The area at the water plant that's been identified as a potential cause of the problems we're facing now is built underground, initially in permafrost. That permafrost is melting and all of our pipe infrastructure is now in the active layer, so it's subject to heaving and moving in the ground that wasn't really designed for,” he explained.

“So, our pipes are breaking off from access faults and snapping and breaking all winter.”

"From what I can tell, the land they claim was traditionally Inuu territory. The land was conquered by northern Labrador Inuit and the British who battled against the Inuu and the French in an area called Battle Harbour during the Seven Years War. This occurred in the 1700's.

The Inuu language is in the Algonquin language family, but I can see they have some Eskimo-Aleut influences due to proximity.

Naung, the people there are Inuit, but I don't think they have rights to that land. They've only been there 300 years, rather than the thousand(s?) of years the Inuit can generally claim to our other territories. Complicated situation, because the Inuit didn't conquer the land on their own merits, but with help from colonists. 

Then there's the discussion about what it means to be Inuit. I'm against the idea of Inukness being defined by genetics. That might be my own biased because I'm half qallunaaq myself.

It's conquered territory and I can see that might be why the ITK doesn't want it recognized as part of Inuit Nunangat.",t2_8q2om,Juutai,0,1634159992.0,0,t1_hgj85mc,hgj85mc,True,constantlyhere100,t3_q7j56y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nunavut/comments/q7j56y/inuit_organization_objects_to_labrador_groups/,Inuit organization objects to Labrador group’s push for Indigenous rights,/r/nunavut/comments/q7j56y/inuit_organization_objects_to_labrador_groups/hgj85mc/,8,r/nunavut,0,8

"I've heard it called an eskimo roll in English.

The connotation that Eskimo is a derogatory term comes from the Eskimo registry. I don't want to get into that. 

Naung, that's a whole discussion with advocates on both sides. I'm pro E-word, and I rather think the issue is being blown out of proportion for quick political victories such as the football team name change.

But I can understand the term causing problems for the team due to qallunaat finding the E-word offensive. Regardless of what the Inuit think, I'm not going to force them to keep a name that will sell less tickets.

In any case, I'm going to learn how to do an eskimo roll so that I can safely nattiqsiuq by qajaq one of these years. Other people can do what they want with what language they speak.

"He was asked questions by reporters, so he answered.  He even says it's probably not going to happen, because the parties don't agree.

It's not like he's proposing it as a platform plank -- he just answered a question and The Globe turned it into an article.

As detailed in the article, you can see that what he said is the same thing he has said for the past 5 years:

> Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said Saturday that he remains open to getting rid of Canada’s first-past-the-post electoral system if his party is re-elected, but added that it’s not a priority since there’s no consensus on the issue.

> Trudeau said, however, that he would not favour proportional representation as an alternative, saying the system “gives more weight to smaller parties that are perhaps fringe parties.”

> Trudeau instead expressed his preference for a ranked-ballot system, saying such an approach contributes to less divisive elections.

> “I have always been a fan of ranked ballots where people get to choose first choice, second choice, third choice,” he said during a campaign stop in Aurora, Ont. “I think it forces parties to come together and make a pitch to be the second choice of other voters, and therefore they are less divisive.”

> Trudeau added Saturday that moving forward with electoral reform was “not a priority” since there was still no consensus among political parties on the issue.

> “If ever there is more of a consensus, it could be interesting to follow up on and I’d be open to that, because I’ve never flinched in my desire for ranked ballots,” he said.

And everything above is also true.

They didn't do electoral reform 5-6 years ago, because parties don't agree on what type of electoral reform to implement. The NDP like proportional representation, the Liberals like ranked ballots, and the Conservatives probably like the current FPTP system.

He even says above that it probably won't be implemented, because the parties don't agree on what changes to make. Even if the Liberals and NDP were to agree to make some changes, the Conservatives would ""do a Trump"" and say they ""rigged the election"", which would poison electoral reform.

So it's unfortunately not going to happen unless all the main parties agree.

"I am not from Nunavut but as someone who has visited Rankin Inlet a handful of times, I have some observations that may or may not be the kind of info you’re looking for. Please bear in mind that these are just my observations and are from only one community. Experiences and mileage may vary. 

There is a true sense of community. What I experienced was a warm and welcoming people with a sharp sense of humour. Community and sharing is really important. Taking care of your neighbour is important. If you’re open and interested, you can learn a great deal about the culture. 

Native tongue speakers have a calmer quieter and more intentional cadence in their English. It has a way of quieting the space and leaving room for thoughtful and careful discussion. 

I’m used to cold winters (-35 to -40C is common where I am from) and yet somehow being in Rankin in November a couple of years ago, I experienced -31C temps that cut right through me to the core and in what felt like an instant. So dressing for the temps is key to your enjoyment. Prioritize comfort and warmth over fashion.

There are some incredibly beautiful landscapes in Nunavut. For bonus points, [here](https://m.imgur.com/PjA5m48?r) is a shot of the bay in November 2019 that I have posted to this subreddit before.

For dog sledding you would need to visit when there is significant snow and you won’t see that in September. At that time of year for wild life you will see ravens and maybe bunting birds in Iqaluit.

There’s lots of walking to do around town and in Sylvia Grinnell park, and there’s the aquatic centre too if you want something indoors to do. The movie theatre is also open again now that the renos are done.

"Most sealskins are bought by the local wildlife office from harvesters and then they’re taken to get processed by splendor fur. Following processing the furs are sold to large stores and become commercially available at places like the northern or the coop in town. The biggest issue with sealskin is that because of lack of commercial interest due to market restrictions, and active anti fur lobby groups, the furs don’t reach as high of a price at market compared to a decade ago. Few people scrape and tan their own sealskin (at least in my community).

I would recommend buying goods that are made with sealskin, like gloves, mitts, earrings, kamiks, zipper pulls, key chains, etc. Again you can contact the HTO that can put you in touch with anyone that makes them, or check out the local buy and sell on Facebook. By buying hand made items, you are supporting the sealskin industry and also a local person in the community. And, let’s be honest, you also get a rad new craft!

"Had not heard of Angry Inuk but it seems interesting and will have to give it a watch.

Looking at the description the obvious answer is to simply ask her via [social media](https://twitter.com/Alethea_Aggiuq).  


As for the suggestion to just donate, this seems antithetical to the idea of the film. The Inuit need acceptance and support in their culture, work and independence.

"Internet

Bandwidth caps is kinda rough here. We have 100 gigs for around $125 a month here. Ping is 600ms ish. Download speeds are fine like 50 Mbps down and 20 Mbps up. Just make sure you set your netflix and youtube to low quality. Download your games before you get here.

Polar bears:

I don't think I've heard of one near town this year. Though we have had wolves in town. I don't bring a gun with me when I am leaving town now to go fishing or anything on most short trips (IE within sight of the town). I will if I am going off road anywhere where there isn't much people traffic. People look out for each other when it comes to wildlife.

Weather:

Right now it is starting to get cold here. Summer is all but gone. The good news is you won't get 24 hour sunlight anymore and we are getting close to regular light hour here.  It is cold enough for me to have to wear a warm sweater and think about gloves when I go out now.

This is a big one. Food is kinda expensive up here. The good news is Cambridge bay is the cheapest in the region.  I don't know where you are from but I am from Nova Scotia and food was expensive there too. Junk food costs a lot more. Regular food is a bit more.

You should be safe in town. At least in my hometown, if there's a bear spotted nearby, you'll hear about it. Don't be out walking around when there's a bear warning. Not sure how often that happens in Cambridge, but we've had two bear warnings this summer in my hometown. But as most towns are along the coast, even being on the edge of town can be dangerous. 

The bears like to be in the sea, and they're more likely to come out of the sea in stormy weather. They're also fairly good at sneaking up along hills, so try not to be where you have long lines of sight. Don't hangout at the bottom of hills.

"A lot of other commenters have covered your question about clothing so I will offer some other advice!

* Get all your appointments and your kiddo's done before you come up - dentist, eye exams, things like that. Those services are available here but the wait times can be really long. Make sure all your prescriptions are up to date and filled too.
* Plan to bring at least one giant Rubbermaid full of food - spices, dry goods, snacks. If you drink you will want to also bring some bottles of liquor. There is a beer and wine store but hard liquor is not accessible (or anyway it's very cumbersome to get). 
* Do a bit of research/learning about Inuit culture, history, and language. You don't need to become an expert but this is their land and coming in with no knowledge at all is disrespectful IMO. There is a publication called ""The Inuit Way"" by Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada that's a good starting point (though a few years old now).
* Get involved in the community. A lot of people who move up here for work stay really isolated and just go to work and come home. It's easy to feel lonely here, especially in the cold and dark months, but there are a lot of events, opportunities to volunteer, etc. Lots of families with young children too. I don't have kids but the aquatic centre has family swims, probably a great place to meet people!

"The weather lately has been cold and gray. We may get a few more days of 13 degree weather  on a sunny day but it has not been a great summer weather-wise. 

September is approaching and it will likely be snowing by Halloween. December and January are cold af, -20 to -30's. Dry cold. 

In terms of clothing, bring parkas, hats (toques), gloves, etc...

In terms of parkas I have never owned an expensive Canada Goose jacket and have been just fine so feel free to not overspend. I used ski coats that I would use at any ski mountain in BC. 

If you plan on hiking or exploring, etc.. bring long johns, insulated, pants etc.. You can also order from Amazon (or elsewhere online) the things you decide you will need. I atv and snowmobile and I have ordered all my gear online or bought it locally.

"This is sort of annoying, because I, myself an ᐃᓄᒃ, would also like to learn ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ. There aren't many available resources, unless you feel like flying to ᐃᖃᓗᐃᑦ, and taking the class put out by [ᐱᕈᕐᕕᒃ](https://www.pirurvik.ca/). You can check out [ᑐᓵᓪᓚᖓ](https://tusaalanga.ca/welcome-bienvenue) as well. Our internet infrastructure is not nearly good enough to be offering online courses.

I'm used to speaking mixed language. ᑐᑭᕈᓐᓂᐊᖅᑐᖓ, but I don't have enough words to express solely in ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ. I can read syllabics just fine, like, I can make the sounds. I don't know enough to know what I'm reading most of the time.

A thing to know about syllabics is that they were not developed by us. Essentially, they were developed by a collaboration between some guy named Jim and the Cree for their languages. I think Cree might be the wrong label, but I don't know as much about what they have going on. The history there gets murky, white-washed and is genocide-adjacent. The syllabics were adapted from Cree to ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ so the church can bring their religion up here. I have some strong opinions about that, but I'll angrily keep them to myself out of respect for my elders.

History aside, I like them. They're pretty. I feel like ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ is different enough from other languages that use the same syllabics that I can tell when I'm seeing ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ. They're being adopted into our cultural identity, now that we finally have control over that. Your comment about ""I want to learn the dialect that uses syllabics"", sorta rubs me the wrong way. Not purposefully disrespectful, but ignorantly disrespectful.

I've had a look at your post history. Seems like in the last week, you've asked to learn Hebrew, Cherokee, Navajo, Greek, German, Welsh and also Inuktitut.

"Hi there,

My wife and I moved to the North about a year ago and were absolutely broke so we had to pack on a budget.

We got our outerwear from Mountain Warehouse. Not the highest quality, but affordable and warm. we just looked for the coldest rated thing we can afford. Even if if isn't rated for -40, I'd say anything -30 or colder is fine, because you will layerr. Fleece sweaters are great.

The big thing with jackets is to make sure it isn't bomber style, you want them to go half way or so to your knees. 

I'd also recommend snow pants that have shoulder straps, they tend to stay on better and go up your back further. 

As for boots, a popular brand is Sorel for the best bang for your buck. 

Bring scarves, a couple of face masks, and goggles as well. If it's within your budget grab two pairs of goggles, one that's tinted for the sunny days and one that is clear for the dark. Bottom line is when it is -40 or below and windy, any exposed skin WILL get frostbite in only a few minutes. 

If the government is paying for your move, take advantage of the weight they will ship and get heavy items up that way. I am seriously regretting not bringing up a deep freezer. 

Oh, and for the dark months bring vitamin D. A lot of it. My wife and I will likely take 6000 units a day in the dark months. I'm usually a sceptic when it comes to vitamin tablets but these things are as important to me in the winter as coffee.

Speaking of which, if you drink coffee, bring your own Keurig or whatever you use. It gets expensive to buy and ship things up. 

Bring a basic tool set, hammer, hanging materials (the 3M clips are amazing) an adjustable wrench, screwdriver etc. 

Bring some photos you like and hang them on the walls, makes a big difference in mood and making your new home feel like home. 

Bring shelving if possible, just grab some things from Walmart, and keep it in the box. 

If you like to fish, bring some rods and reels! To prevent my rods for breaking I bought some PVC pipe  and pipe caps from Home Depot for fairly cheap, taped the ends shut, and bam. Done. 

I'd also recommend board games or some sort of easy entertainment. 

Oh, a Brita filter/water jug is a good idea as well. 

Sorry my post is so disjointed haha. If you want, send me a private message and as I think of more stuff I'll message you!",t2_irx85,Grrrison,0,1627130454.0,0,t1_h6cyr7x,h6cyr7x,True,vangoober777777,t3_oqclrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nunavut/comments/oqclrv/moving_to_sanikiluaq_tips_for_shopping_and_in/,"Moving to Sanikiluaq, tips for shopping and in general",/r/nunavut/comments/oqclrv/moving_to_sanikiluaq_tips_for_shopping_and_in/h6cyr7x/,3,r/nunavut,0,3

"We go back and forth a little further north to Pond Inlet/Igloolik.  

I took a lot of layers:  long sleeve and underwear merino knits from Costco, a couple of fleece jackets, layered  mitts.  I loved my fleece pants from MEC.  I got away with those for most of a mild January instead of the snow pants I brought up.  Find someone to make a Pang crochet hat when you are here  They are warm, windproof and stylish.  Warm boot with grippy soles are a must.  Rubber boots with a thermal lining rated to -40 might be an idea but I just took regular.

 My Biolight headlamp was much used during my winter walks along with pointy ski/hiking poles (also good for rabid animals in spring..no joke there has been outbreaks).  Look for a small winter down throw  for the airplane and house.  

Shipping dry goods is a good idea especially things like cake mix, chocolate chips, chips, cookies and crackers and all the snack stuff.  Those foods are expensive.  Weirdly vinegar is $11 a litre.  Milk is cheap, coffee and sugar is not.  Pop, not on sale, is $60 for a case of 12. 

If you can bring small appliances do so.  Our 12in table top fan was $100 this week. If i could fly an Instapot and Airfryer Would.  Sell them here when done.  

Bring TP, shampoo , hair color if that is your thing.  Laundry soap, softener.  A sewing kit, small toolkit,  and crafts for the long nights.  Smelly candles or diffuser are a nice to have.  And try for tiny seasonal decorations.

One final note:  If you find a reverse osmosis water filter, for the love of all that holy in your GI tract, ship it.

"I've never been to Sanikiluaq. I grew up a little further north in Coral Harbour.

Fresh fruits are expensive, and I imagine you won't have access or a taste for muktaaq, which is our natural source of vitamin C up here. My parents like to ship up canned fruits like peaches in syrup, as well as straight up vitamin C supplements.

"Rankin is the second largest community in Nunavut, so there are a decent amount of stores for food options. There are a couple grocery stores, some convenience stores, and a handful of restaurants. I usually always pack an extra piece of luggage with food - so I'd recommend that, especially if you're going back and forth.  

Weather-wise, it can fluctuate in temperature. In the last week or so, it's been in the 20's but also dipping down close to zero.  I find it quite windy in Rankin compared to other places in the north. The wind can be beneficial though, as it keeps the flies at bay at this time of year. I'd make sure you start bringing warm clothes from late August onwards.  I find it can get quite muddy at times, more so in the spring when the snow is melting. I walk everywhere so rubber boots have been a packing essential for me.

Someone can correct me but I’d expect… a lot of bugs. I bring a cheapo face bug netting I got at MEC and always get thoroughly roasted for it by locals but I have no shame. Other places I’ve been along the Hudson Bay coast have been exceedingly buggy in the summer. Apparently it isn’t as bad if you have a more meat-centric diet (fruit etc… makes you smell tasty I guess…).

I think there’s good berry picking around there but I’m not sure if that’ll be the season… locals will know.

If you’re there for a while you might be there for the polar bear migration up from Churchill but that isn’t till the fall/freeze-up I think.

"Cambridge Bay is nice. There’s a fish plant in town that makes good Arctic char jerky. Pretty sure there’s a restaurant/food window in the Northern and people kept telling me about an amazing restaurant in town but I could never find it. There’s an unofficial kind of golf course just south of the airport. I remember the nursing station being pretty big/nice (unless I’m thinking of Gjoa Haven). There’s a big fancy research station there too (CHARS) and I think they’re still offering tours.

The ice leaves there pretty early, gives you more opportunities to go out boating etc…

I’d say try to get involved with the community/make friends as much as you can and go out on the land if you have the opportunity to do so. 

I don’t remember the bugs being that bad in the summer when I was there but that might be me seeing things with rose-tinted glasses/relative to other places. Something to keep in mind. 

If you have particular brands of things you prefer, I would stock up a bit before going. Even if they have it it’s going to be much cheaper in the south (I used to do this with my favourite teas because I’m a creature of habit).

Bell works in some places but not all, check the coverage map for your provider. 
Nunavut is usually one of those places where you either absolutely love it or you hate it. It is like visiting a foreign country in your own ( if you are Canadian).

You won’t need winter clothes in the summer - it can get really hot. Would recommend looking up the average monthly temperatures for the spot you’re moving to.

Your comment about Canadian Tire made me giggle. In my experience, that’s what a lot of people call the dump. 

Every hamlet I’ve been to has at least had a Co-op and a Northern store. They sell food and a bunch of other products (clothes, houseware, etc…). The prices will probably shock you. I haven’t spent much time in Iqaluit but I imagine there are more stores there.

I’ve never had any issues getting reception with my Telus plan in town in Nunavut. Look up the coverage map for the service provider before committing (Rogers used to be useless for example).

Let them know your credentials and they may be able to suggest something. The fact that you are not a Canadian citizen may be difficult - I know personally that American teachers won’t be hired without first receiving a Canadian certification equivalent.

You can call 1-800-o-Canada for more information about how to get your visas and certifications in order.

"Removing an Inuit child (even one in foster care) is no easy or straight forward feat. As much as children are in great need there is also tremendous community resistance from moving a child out of the territory. 

If you are truly committed to only adopting an Inuit child, consider moving to a community for a few years so that you can establish yourself with the department of family services as a loving and trustworthy couple. 

You will also gain key insight into the culture you will help preserve/support in your child’s future and most importantly have a first-hand appreciation for the environment they grew up in so that you can understand their trauma.

Every child in Nunavut has potential, but children who are in the foster program will have pronounced and unique challenges to face as you build a home together.

I have seen many success stories but also a few devastating failures of the system so it is possible but it won’t be as simple as filling out paperwork remotely and visiting a community once to pick the child up.

">During that time, Canada was increasing its efforts to exert sovereignty in the North by encouraging Inuit to abandon a traditional nomadic lifestyle and settle in permanent communities

It just gets me how carelessly cbc describes the active cultural assimilation at the time. ""Increasing its efforts"" ""Encourage to abandon"". They were taking the children from families and holding them at these communities. So we moved.

But yeah, real qallunaat thing to misunderstand how igluit work and think he can make better. I can see they were hoping for a portable temporary shelter for out on the land with these things like how igluit are used. Not as a permanent shelter. Igluit were temporary survival shelters. And then the thing caught fire and killed an elder.

I feel like if they're going to suggest foam igluit again, then they should just make cabins instead. One room cabin, bachelor pad. For young single/couples with few kids. Like they have on the land, but in town because I guess shit's kinda fucked yo.

If you do come here I suggest applying for a health card right away it took a really long time to come. Also side note if you don’t have a Nunavut health card and need to be medivaced out for an emergency it’s around $30 000 so make sure you apply! 

As far as I know you need to get your prescriptions filled in Iqaluit or get them filled at home and mailed up. If you are coming try to get your home doctor to give you a few months supply of your prescriptions.

Not only was the topic on point and the pertinent issues brought up, the production value was excellent and quite entertaining even though the subject is difficult. You already know what my critique will be... the pronunciation of Inuktut words and names. But! I'm not one to neg without giving support. I highly recommend spending some time on [Tusaalanga](https://tusaalanga.ca), this is an excellent website where you can learn pronunciation and some basic Inuktut. Even better, the website has different sections for the different dialects so that you can ensure you're saying something correctly depending on the region you're speaking about.

"Before this thread disappears into a black hole of disinformation and mindless gibberish, let's set out some actual facts.

First, the purpose of a national pharmacare program is to provide drug coverage to all those millions of Canadians who do not already have supplementary health insurance, whether obtained through an employer or purchased by the individual. That takes in gig workers, employees of numerous small businesses, self-employed people etc. 

So it's not a ""stupid health care bill."" It's intended to fill a glaring gap in Canadian health care.

Second, the Inuit of Nunavut (85% of Nunavut's population) and all other Indigenous people in Canada don't really need a national pharmacare program. This is because they have an equivalent federal program called the Non-Insured Health Benefits program. Inuit in Nunavut do not have to pay for prescriptions because of the NIHB. 

However, national pharmacare would provide insurance coverage to non-Inuit in Nunavut who don't work for government or who are self-employed. There is a definite need for this.

Third, health care is a provincial-territorial responsibility under the constitution. Which means the federal government cannot introduce national pharmacare without the co-operation of provincial and territorial governments.

This is probably why the NDP bill refers to things that provinces and territories have to agree to do before receiving transfers from the federal government. It's reasonable for the federal government to insist on certain standards before handing money out to provinces and territories.

Last, it's perfectly normal for a member of Parliament to promote a bill sponsored by their party. This is not grandstanding. It's normal, healthy political communication.",t2_7f5l2hls,riversidejim,0,1614297039.0,0,t1_gorqm1y,gorqm1y,False,leftwingmememachine,t3_lrr69a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nunavut/comments/lrr69a/nunvaut_mp_on_the_defeat_of_the_ndp_pharmacare/,Nunvaut MP on the defeat of the NDP pharmacare bill in parliament: Today we got another broken promise.,/r/nunavut/comments/lrr69a/nunvaut_mp_on_the_defeat_of_the_ndp_pharmacare/gorqm1y/,7,r/nunavut,0,7

And followed it in the snow. After a while he caught up to it. Took his aim, shot and again, the bird went flying. Another miss. And so he went up a hill. Shot after shot. Miss after miss. It was after about an hour maybe after 7 or 8 shots my uncle looked back and in the snow he saw that he hadn't missed. He saw blood in every spot where he had shot at the bird. After realising he hadn't missed he looked at the bird. and he saw it looking back at him. He realised it was bad and it had been luring him. So my uncle runned away never looking back eventually catching up with his dad. That's how my uncle was lured away from his dad.

Qivitteq is the greenlandic shapeshifter and boogeyman. Everyone has a story. When we get together and tell scary stories we'll call it ""qivitsilersaarneq"" ""stories of qivitteq"" it's our favourite kind of stories in the winter.",t2_11em49,Mikaali86,0,1613782045.0,0,t1_go2hcz2,go2hcz2,True,[deleted],t3_lj2wp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nunavut/comments/lj2wp5/in_canadian_inuit_folklore_do_you_also_have_the/,In Canadian Inuit Folklore do you also have the Qivittoq?,/r/nunavut/comments/lj2wp5/in_canadian_inuit_folklore_do_you_also_have_the/go2hcz2/,7,r/nunavut,0,7

"The biggest challenge is the the government is firmly in bed with Bell, and that the telco market in Canada is a corrupt boondoggle to begin with. That, and that nobody really cares about the North. The North has 2 purposes: sovereignty grandstanding and photo ops, and resources to give away to corporations. Nobody gives a shit about anyone who lives here because there's too few people to have any electoral power, and most of them aren't white and wealthy anyway.

The problem with BCE is that the pension funds are so heavily invested in them that they need that BCE share price to keep growing perpetually. The only way to do that if you already own the market is by endlessly increasing prices and ripping people off. If the feds would actually do to BCE what they should, it would mean a big hit to the pension fund of almost every public servant in Canada.

What Nunavut needs is a regulated backbone that provides enough capacity. People in the north don't need southerners to do stuff for them, we just need the infrastructure to do it ourselves.

"The Inuvialuit region, or Beaufort Sea region, which more or less overlaps with Inuvik, was included in the original Nunavut proposals made by the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada land claim committee during the mid-1970s. They proposed a boundary that would roughly follow the treeline, all the way to the boundary with Yukon, including the Inuvialuit.

The Inuvialuit were represented on the 1982 to 1987 Nunavut Constitutional Forum and there appeared to be an expectation on their part that they would be included in a future Nunavut territory.

IMHO I think the Inuvialuit leadership were playing east against west to try to get the best possible deal for themselves, which included their own regional municipality.

Also, most political and business leaders in the western Northwest Territories strongly objected to the idea of the Inuvialuit region being included in Nunavut. They feared that the remainder of the NWT would be cut off from the sea, and they feared that, after division, the NWT would lose access to the Beaufort Sea's oil and natural gas resources.

So the idea of including the Inuvaluit region became a political non-starter. An early draft boundary agreement produced through the Nunavut Constitutional Forum in 1984 or '85 excluded the Inuvialuit. Tagak Curley, then an MLA, denounced the idea of leaving the region inside the NWT, since it betrayed the original vision of Nunavut. In the end, nobody paid much attention to him.

The issue wasn't finally settled until the signing of the Iqaluit Agreement in 1987, which set out the basic principles for division of the NWT and the creation of Nunavut. The agreed to a division boundary that would follow the land claim boundary between the Inuit of Nunavut and the Dene-Métis of the NWT — and the Inuvialuit would remain in the NWT.

The actually boundary was not settled until 1991, when mediator John Parker helped negotiate a deal between Tungavik Federation of Nunavut and the Dene-Métis, which was ratified narrowly in a 1992 plebiscite.",t2_7f5l2hls,riversidejim,0,1609877490.0,0,t1_gi7txkc,gi7txkc,True,opuntiafragilis,t3_kpq3x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nunavut/comments/kpq3x5/why_was_the_nwts_inuvik_region_not_included_in/,Why was the NWT's Inuvik region not included in Nunavut when it was created?,/r/nunavut/comments/kpq3x5/why_was_the_nwts_inuvik_region_not_included_in/gi7txkc/,2,r/nunavut,0,2

"Inns North and Arctic Co-Ops run a lot of the hotels in the smaller communities, they both have websites as far as I know so you may be able to find info there. Rooms are generally pretty basic although some places have updated over the years. Most hotels have decent cable and mostly usable internet now.

Re number 6, don't negotiate too much for art. It's very common for local carvers to sell their work at the airport, the grocery store, local restaurants, etc. I wouldn't call it a subsistence income but it's not necessarily bringing in the big bucks.

If you see something you like, I wouldn't suggest an offer of less than about $10 off the asking price. And if you can afford to pay the asking price, do so - it makes you look like kind of a dick if you negotiate a guy down by $20 on a $60 carving but then pull the cash out of a full wallet.

Also, I haven't seen anyone mention the national parks - there are 3 (4?) which have varying levels of difficulty of access. Auyuittuq is probably the most popular, Quttinirpaq and Sirmilik are more difficult and $$$$ to get to. You can get a commercial flight to Pangnirtung, and hire an outfitter to take you to where the park starts, but the other two require chartering aircraft and a lot more logistics to visit.

Related to that, many communities have local outfitters that can take you around places but they don't often advertise (it's a very 'word of mouth' kind of place) so asking at a visitor's centre or similar is a good place to start for that kind of thing.

Finally, 'northern time' is a thing here. Weather delays are common (fog in summer, storms in winter). Unexpected mechanical problems for planes are also not unusual. I keep a book of New York Times crosswords in my field pack to keep myself occupied when I travel in the summer because I have been stuck in tiny airports for hours more than a few times.

"Great question! The reason for the boundary between NWT and Nunavut being the way it is, is because that is what was approved in the [1992 NWT Plebiscite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Northwest_Territories_jurisdictional_boundaries_plebiscite). The territorial boundary itself was referred to as the “Parker Boundary Line”, named after [John Havelock Parker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Havelock_Parker). This boundary line was developed through various considerations of existing settlement agreements (ie. Dene and Inuvialuit), geography, Inuit traditional land use and negotiations.

You say “due to public health regulations” that’s just referring to right now during COVID right? I’m talking like 5 years down the road.

I have done lots of research. Biggest reason is a tax break, but further than that I’d like to help a less fortunate community in the world, Africa is great but I’d like to start in my own back yard.

Super old technology that should be reserved for countries that cannot afford implementation of clean energy. Stick with the old and fail, leave nothing for future generations, that's your ideology!

You are entitled to your opinion but backed up with no evidence (are you the moderator of a nuclear power sub with a devoted following?) there will be few people convinced by you.

"I realize you are asking about material complexities but here is the Cole's Notes on some things that you will need to consider from an engineering and a field level standpoint. I build water treatment plants around the north and so I realize that it is different to building a house, but there is a significant amount of overlap when building, period. Plus, there were many times where I had to go and try to borrow material/equipment from the housing guys. 

Just to quickly address concrete - it is used, but rarely. Definitely never for houses. Any concrete that is exposed directly to the weather tends to become brittle and chip at an accelerated rate because the freeze/thaw process is so harsh. I have done concrete for the interior of water plants, however... Pad prep and drainage are absolutely crucial as always, however there will be extra requirements that will make southerners shake their heads (I'm not a concrete guy so I don't know the details, just the frustration of the operators/foremen expressed). Typically the concrete mix is shipped up by barge, as well as a concrete mixing truck, and then you just supply rebar, water and labour to spread and smooth it. It takes almost 4 times as long to prepare and spread as it does in the south.

All homes are made of wood, built on stilts of steel or aluminum scaffolding, and skirted at the bottom. Whether you are building a single family home, or the more recent and much more popular and economical ""5-plexes"".  

The 5 most challenging complexities to building in the north are material, skilled labour, weather, the AHJ/bidding process, and time.

Material must come up by barge and (let's say you are building a house), there is no home depot to run down the road to pick up materials from. There is a local hardware store in most towns, sure, but you can't build a house off of that. Remember all your intangibles as well, ie scaffolding, ladders, wood for blocking, building tables and horses, fences to go around your site, all of those things. Make sure you have a way to secure your materials or (in some but not all communities) your building material will disappear because that is material that can be used to build cabins on the land and you are a rich southerner. You need to ship up your complete house in a sea can or 4, add 20% to all materials. If you are wondering if you will need it or not, just put it in because it is so much more expensive to ship it up later. SEND EXTRA. You may not be able to secure the machinery you want to use, to be able to use it full time or in your ideal time frame because you must work with other contractors in town to share it, or sometimes the machine is just broken down.

Skilled labour is difficult because there are a lot of locals who need work and have done some of the work you will need to be performed, but frankly there is not enough work to go around to make any of them truly great at it, and they do not show up reliably enough to be counted on as a steady source of production. You will never have enough guys on site who are able to produce like a crew down south. You need to bring carpenters, plumbers, electricians, etc from down south but the people who are looking for adventure, to travel, or for a challenge is a slim labour pool. You need to rent a house/hotel/whatever to house them, and feed them. Plus transportation. Depending on the season, there are frequently not enough trucks to go around to rent in the town so you would need to consider barging in a couple of trucks for yourself and either selling them at the end or barging them to your next site.

The weather is a dynamic and constantly changing constant in the north. And it is very different depending on the community you are in. This will make certain times ideal to build and creates a lot of times when you need to drop what you are doing and hustle to complete a different task because you have a weather window. Sheathing a house, and roofing would be two tasks that will have short windows where maybe the wind isn't blowing. The weather also affects your workers. You get much more production done in a slightly cool, overcast environment than you do at -30 when you need to take warmup breaks frequently. The summer is a short season and you will not break ground and move into a house in a season. But you would want to do as much of the ground work as you can in the spring (piles in the ground), then framing over the course of the summer and hopefully you are working indoors in a semi heated environment for the fall/winter.  

You will be competing against local companies when bidding. Contracts are awarded first to any locals who bid on the job, and if you win the contract there will be a clause that your labour on the project must include x% locals. I have seen varying ranges between 20-60% on contracts. You will be asked to submit your payroll proof to the local AHJ. ""Local"" AHJ's will be based from a regional office and if they happen to be in the town you are building in, you will be visited by them often and unannounced, and if you are not, you will have to arrange for them to arrive with a 3 week lead time. In my experience they are all extremely difficult to deal with at every level. They care about making infrastructure that will last beyond when you leave, yes. They are also fighting for clout with people in their offices, and to exact control over you and whatever you think your knowledge of building codes is, they have something to say about it. As an example you could be on the final hour of your handover walk on a 2 year job, and the AHJ will ask for your compaction report from your pad prep on the first day. 

Time is the luxury that makes building houses profitable or not profitable. Whatever your time line is for building, throw it out the window because it will be directly affected by any of the 4 points above significantly, and by many other intangibles that you cannot forsee. You must be able to absolutely ""just roll with it"", and realize that there will be setbacks that you cannot control. Small issues to building a house, office, infrastructure, whatever, in the south, can become show stoppers in the north. For me in some towns it has been a weather window opening up and all aerial boom lifts in town are either broken or.. broken. A lot of times reliable local help will stymie the production of your main crew who will need to spend time showing locals how to perform the job being asked, and then not show up for a week. Being short material or something more specialty than the hardware store carries (looking for a 3/4x5"" bolt?) is disastrous and expensive to have air shipped up. It will also take a week to get to your crew, and longer the further north you go..

So you can see that cost is a major semi controllable variable in 3 ways, and weather/time being two variables that you will have little control over.. Can make it economically unfeasible to build houses in the north. The further you deviate from what is already being done, the more costly it will be. Bid high, expect to lose money to intangibles, and roll with it when it doesn't go like you planned it.

Hope this helps, or is kind of on target for what you are asking about.",t2_fu9uj,Antialias1,0,1605469638.0,0,t1_gcf2tvx,gcf2tvx,True,supersimpleusername,t3_jtarhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nunavut/comments/jtarhc/what_are_the_engineering_complexity_of_building/,What are the engineering complexity of building homes in the Canadian north.,/r/nunavut/comments/jtarhc/what_are_the_engineering_complexity_of_building/gcf2tvx/,3,r/nunavut,0,3

"Pretty much all auto mechanics will tell you it's not necessary to idle your vehicle for more than about 30 seconds up to two or three minutes max to warm it up. The best way to warm up your vehicle is to just drive it, as long as your windshield is clear. Plugging in your block heater makes a big difference too.
