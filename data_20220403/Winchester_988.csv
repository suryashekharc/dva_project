- cons
Not enough daycares. Be prepared to be on a waitlist for two years. 
- the mall is probably one of the worst malls I been to. The Indoor playground is super dirty but it does have its basics. 
- not enough indoor kid entertainment 
- Lot’s of businesses cannot remain open. The hottest thing was Bin 5 and that closed less than a year because of stealing.

- great outdoors 
- lots of places with history 
- Great neighbors

"Omg, you’re a fucking dumbass and I’m tired of being nice. 

Roughly 275k-300k people attend Apple blossom yearly and people from all of the world come to Winchester specifically for Apple Blossom. I know because I’ve done crowd control with the police department at Apple Blossom. As much as you want to believe, it’s not only attended by locals. Do you think all of the performers and guests and marching bands and visiting fire/rescue teams and carnival employees simply don’t take up space and resources while they are here?

Second, Mardi Gras is the only parade festival/celebration in the US that lasts longer than Apple Blossom and ends with a parade. Macy’s Thanksgiving parade is not the culmination of 7+ days of activities celebrating Thanksgiving. The Firefighters parade is the largest of its kind in the nation. I’m not going to apologize for you being a moron and not knowing what a “parade celebration” or “festival” is. 

Last, NYC is fucking built for the number of tourists, commuters, and residents they have. Winchester is not. It doesn’t even have the infrastructure required to handle the 27k people who live there. Do you understand that the police department borrows cops from other cities to cover the influx of visitors? Did you know that portable cell boosters are brought in to handle the increase in cellular traffic during that week because the cell towers can’t handle it. Do you realize that dozens of residential streets are completely cordoned off for the safety of the crowds downtown? Traffic gets detoured all around town to accommodate this fucking thing. 

There is a reason that planning for Apple Blossom starts the day after Sunday in the park ends.

"There are exceptions. I’d like to think our family is one of them. Lol. We don’t homeschool for religious reasons or political reasons. We’re the exact opposite of those folks. For years, I spoke with people in Richmond about homeschooling regulations and how they hurt a lot of kids in this state. I was interviewed by various leftist and atheist outlets and tried to organize homeschool communities for people who were educating at home but were networking with people outside of the home to provide enrichment and access to education that they didn’t feel qualified in providing. I’m sure you can imagine, the lawmakers were uninterested and the communities I managed to round up were very small and broke apart when people would move to areas of better opportunities. When an article was released where I was interviewed by a religious outlet, I started getting threats online and then some local people recognized me. I dropped all efforts at the first real life confrontation from a neighbor. Some of these people are insistent on academically crippling their children. 

The private schools here aren’t as bad as the public schools, but the same gap exists between them and their counterparts in other areas of the state. Of course, we have a few whackadoo religious private schools too. Check out the one just south of Stephens City. The teachers’ qualifications are something else and the curriculum is whack.

"I'm sure exceptions exist but I don't think I've ever personally met a home schooled kid that had parents that I would trust with teaching kids.  It does seem like it's mostly people who don't want to expose their kids to public school (usually for religious reasons) and less about getting them the best education.  My BIL home schools and I'm pretty sure it's because he doesn't want to be bogged down by strict schedules (he's a new age pastor that's all about having fun with people).  Unsurprisingly, his kids are behind in school.  My SIL home schools because of probably religious reasons (her husband is paranoid because everything is evil).  Her kid is also behind.  

I also have the feeling that there is a misconception that private schools are better.  In Winchester?  Sure, I'd buy that.  But I've met plenty of private school kids that for whatever reason thought they were literary geniuses but also seemed bad at math. I'm curious if their college acceptance levels are more about means and not about education.  I have friends whose kids go to a private school in Fairfax County that grandpa pays for.

"Mirrors my own experience as a kid, coming from a private school in Fairfax to a similar private school in Winchester when I was in middle school. The private schools here are no exception to the criticism of the education experience. My siblings and I were ahead of everyone by so far that the school and my parents were trying to get FCPS to allow me, a sixth grader, to attend JWHS for a 9th grade math class like they allowed an 8th grader at my school. They refused. I spent 6th - 8th doing the same algebra and then FCPS refused to allow me into geometry as a freshman so I had to sit through Algebra again. I had teachers take pity on me and send me home with books from their private libraries. I ended up being so isolated from my classmates that I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and a depressive disorder by 7th grade. I’m not even exceptionally gifted. Lol. My school experience, private and public in this area, was literally depressing as fuck.  

The public schools are worse, and there are absolutely garbage religious schools here, but I wouldn’t recommend anything in the area except the Montessori school for younger kids.

"Your experience reminded me of my oldest kid.  She started in Fairfax County.  When she got to Stonewall for 2nd grade, she was well ahead of most of the other kids.

In 5th grade, she asked if she could get bumped up a reading level because she was getting 100% on everything and she said it was boring.  She was told no because they said she only wanted to move up because her best friend was in the next level up.  They didn't even consider that she had outgrown her current reading level.

Fast forward to now and we're in a MUCH better school system in a different state.  She's in honors math and she struggled in the beginning because she had never seen the things they were doing.  According to her teacher, that was all review stuff she should already know (her teacher is also kind of a bitch so take it with a grain of salt).  Luckily, I'm competent at math so she's all caught up now and doing fine.  But it just goes to show you how behind that area is compared to some other districts.

"On mobile - sorry for wall of text. I had a similar experience with Quarles in the city. I know some folks will insist that WPS are the better because they’re inside the city limits and that’s ridiculous. My kids are educated at home. We had a year where I had some health issues and we put our then-Kindergartner and then-4th grader in public schools. Huge waste of time. All through the school year, we were told that our Kindergartner was so far advanced that to keep him from getting bored, they had him reading aloud to classmates and helping the teacher grade papers. Wtf? The first conference we went to, the classroom aid started off with “you should have indicated that he could already read!” The teacher said something about how he was always done with quiet work first and, when given a choice to go play with manipulative or read, he always chose to go read. They were “concerned” that he wasn’t getting “the full experience” (of Playdoh?!) and so they were making him read aloud quietly to other kids as they gradually finished their work. Later, they told us that they had him helping grade papers. Waste of time. Same for my 4th grader, with a twist. From the beginning, they told us he was further along in math and reading and so they had him help classmates who were struggling. I asked for more advance math like the gifted classes I was in as a kid. They laughed and told me “those classes don’t exist like that anymore because they left too many kids behind”. Ok…so what’s my kid to do? Continue tutoring, I guess? Yep. Until the end of they year when they were panicking over some SOL exam that almost everyone in the class was in danger of failing. They tried to force my kid to attend after school sessions of SOL prep like everyone else and I refused. They suddenly claimed my kid wasn’t ready for 5th grade and was in danger of failing. They threatened to fail my kid if he didn’t attend these prep sessions after school to prep for a test that he’d been helping his classmates with all year long. It got messy. Thankfully, I was in better health by then and we went back to educating them at home the next year. The school system is happy to report that all is well right up until they’re accountable to a parent who can advocate or a governing body that wants test scores. Oh, and the casual racism is loads of fun. 

I attended Handley and James Wood High School after spending elementary and middle school years in private schools. This was in the mid to late 90s.

"The schools suck.  They are rated very low.  My kids went to Stonewall and James Wood Middle School.  My son went to a special needs preschool that was supposed to catch him up to be ready for kindergarten.

The principal of Stonewall at the time once disclosed to me that 90% of the kids there received free/reduced price lunch.  Yet the surrounding area is full of people that are against government handouts.  The parents seem to be against any modern curriculums.  I'd argue that the biggest issue with Winchester's schools is that the parents don't give a shit about education or their kids' futures.  I don't think it's on purpose.  It's just ignorance.

My son's preschool continuously let us know that his progress was great when we'd bring up concerns that he didn't seem ready for kindergarten.  They kept assuring us everything was great.  Then, at the end of the year, they were like, ""Oops he's not ready at all.  Our bad.""  Needless to say we were pretty pissed about it.  They ended up paying for him to attend a private preschool for a year and he started kindergarten a year late.

My kids would often come home repeating what they heard in school, which was sometimes pretty racist.  They'd also repeat some pretty ignorant political statements.  So many people in the area say the schools are great.  I don't know what they are smoking.  I'm glad I moved.",t2_e89vr,CaptainAwesome06,0,1648039846.0,0,t1_i1seai8,i1seai8,True,dragokhal,t3_tkgtzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winchester/comments/tkgtzn/whats_your_school_story/,What's your school story?,/r/Winchester/comments/tkgtzn/whats_your_school_story/i1seai8/,9,r/Winchester,0,9

"That's surprising to hear.  I have been through many house buying scenarios over 20 years, and always used an inspector.  Even on this new house I recently jumped into, I had an independent inspector check things over, pre-drywall and final.  Everytime I had an inspection done, there were things noted that I was never going to spot myself.  

I've had inspectors find foundation cracks that I wasn't going to, and he talked me out of buying a house.  Had them catch out-of-code plumbing that would've bit me in the a$$ later.  Had them catch where the builder is going cheap and advise me on how to call them out and build better.

I've always had my inspectors earn their keep, that is, find stuff to address that far exceeds their cost.  And maybe that's their job and they know it.  But I try to imagine not having used an inspector on any of the past 10 houses I've bought, and realize what would've caught up to me later on...

Not to be disagreeable, in this market, forgoing an inspection may be the way to win a contract.

"In my experience, lots of sales happen quickly, within days usually and generally no inspections involved.  There is a misconception about 
what inspections actually entail.  The inspection is simply there for the prospective purchaser to be able to find / discover any deficiencies to serve as a negotiation on the price point, not a ""pass or fail"" scenario. Although, I do understand that some states do require an inspection to be done as part of the sale process.  In this area, someone requesting an inspection is generally on an VA / FHA / USDA Loan where those conditions are required, but most of the time, the houses sell very quickly often sight-unseen (other than the internet listing), usually within just a few days, for the asking price.

">Something tells me your threshold and opinion on this are pretty skewed.

Sure.  I value different things than a sizable portion of that area.  I thought I was pretty clear on that.

>You seem bitter and jaded. 

I wouldn't call it bitter or jaded.  It's not like Winchester wronged me in some way.  I just think it's kind of a shitty area.  I liked it at first.  It has a lot to offer.  But it could be a lot better and the reason it's not is because of the people.

>What racism have you experienced from the people of Winchester?

I'm a white guy.  This isn't exclusive to Winchester but it happened all the time while I was there.  People would just routinely say racist stuff around me.  Like they just assume I'm OK with racism just because I'm white?  The first time I met my new next door neighbor, she was telling me her kids were acting like ""DANs"".  I must have given a weird look because she elaborated.  ""They're acting like Damn Ass N\*\*\*\*\*s.""  That's just one example but was a pretty common experience when I lived there.  Also, as mentioned previously, consider how much people love Jubal Early Blvd.  A road named after a white supremacists that was named in the 1990s.  I understand they voted to change the name but the outcry against changing it was ridiculous.  Early wasn't even from Winchester and was a white supremacist until he died.

>Also what modern evidence are they rejecting in their curriculum?

As an example, Common Core.  It's an evidence based curriculum.  This isn't exclusive to Winchester, as the whole country seems to have an issue with it.  I'd argue most people don't understand it.  I was pretty active in my kids' schools while I was there.  The amount of parents who disliked modern education was staggering, considering the lack of their own education.  You'd think they'd want better for their own kids but they seem fine with their kids ending up like them.  I always thought the goal was to get your kids on a trajectory better than your own.  I guess not.

>Last I checked the city government is a dem lean and the mayor himself is a person of color.

I apologize if I was unclear.  I'm talking about the greater Winchester area.  Based on your replies, I would think you'd fit in better in Frederick County than the City of Winchester.  I lived in Frederick County so that's where I'm coming from.  Everybody just calls the whole area ""Winchester"".  That's on me if that wasn't clear.  Since everybody was suggesting Stephen City and other surrounding areas, I thought we were on the same page.

>But that you either have an agenda

I don't live there anymore.  I don't have an agenda except to give a perspective to people who don't realize the area's culture is kind of shitty.  Some people like Confederate flags and heroin.  I don't.  Just trying to give an honest opinion.

>or an opinion you don’t care to budge from.

I think I'm in the minority in my opinion since to me it seemed like most of the people were born and raised there and think it's great.  But like I said before, it's a small town with small town minds.  It's no different than a lot of places that are afraid of change.  If Winchester got better, I'd have no problem changing my opinion.  If it doesn't get better, it's just going to rot in place like other cities, such as Cumberland, MD.

>If the biggest issue of the town is they didn’t rename a road I’d say we’ve landed on a good spot to live.

The road name is not the issue.  The accompanying culture that led to the road name is one the issues.

>Also wouldn’t it make sense for Virginia to have areas named after important historical figures who lived and interacted in the state in important historical events?

I agree.  However, naming roads after people is a way of honoring them.  Jubal Early fought a battles in the Winchester area.  Other than that, he has no connection to the area.  He was from Virginia but not for that area.  Furthermore, the guy fled to Mexico and Cuba after the war.  He spent his later years being a proponent of white supremacy.  He was an unabashed racist until he died.  You can look up quotes of his that make it obvious.  Why TF would someone name a street after him in the 1990s?! Oh yeah, because people are racist.

>Also why don’t you live in Fairfax County?

Fairfax County has its own problems and I wouldn't call those people the best of the best, either.  But we moved out of Fairfax Co. because my wife went to SU for a career change.  After she graduated she took a job at Urgent Care.  After being burned out working at Urgent Care, she took her dream job in another state.  Right now, we live right on the border of an area that's a lot like Loudoun and an area that's a lot like Frederick Co.  The former has less traffic than Loudoun and none of the douchey ""I'd tell you what I do for a living but then I'd have to kill you"" crowd.  I like it a lot.  The latter has the same small town problems that everybody complains about (nonexistent traffic, home prices going up) but with a lot less racism (not a southern state).  I do see the occasional Confederate flag, though, which is super weird in a northern state.

Despite being fairly progressive, I'm in a very red state right now and a very red county.  I don't agree with all the politics here (mostly state politics) but the education system and hospital systems around here are top notch.

"I mean there’s people in this thread who have seemed to disagree and we’ve also visited and been around the area a long time. We’re from an hour or less away so it’s not like I’m moving to the moon. Something tells me your threshold and opinion on this are pretty skewed.  I think another poster was right. You seem bitter and jaded.  What racism have you experienced from the people of Winchester?  Also what modern evidence are they rejecting in their curriculum? Last I checked the city government is a dem lean and the mayor himself is a person of color. This alone doesn’t equate to an area free of racism but doesn’t lead me to believe it’s any kind of dominant opinion of the area. None of this to me indicates what you are saying is reality. But that you either have an agenda or an opinion you don’t care to budge from.  If the biggest issue of the town is they didn’t rename a road I’d say we’ve landed on a good spot to live. I get the issue with it but I’d say if that’s what we’re arguing about we’ve come a long way.

As someone who had kids in Fairfax County, Frederick County, and now a county that blows Fairfax out of the water, I can tell you the quality of the schools matter.  I'm an engineer and my wife is a physician (former molecular scientist).  As hands-on as we are with our kids' education, it's still an uphill battle when switching to a better school system.  Maybe they'll stay in the Winchester system and be fine.  And hopefully it doesn't affect them in college, if that's their next step.  But there was definitely a noticeable difference in how much my kids' peers learned in a better system while my kids were stuck in Frederick County.  They caught up and now they're fine.  But the point is, the schools there are atrocious.  I blame the surrounding anti-education culture, which brings me to my next point.

The people, in general, suck.  There are so many racist rednecks and deadbeats.  The hottest issue when I was there was whether or not to rename a road that was named after a white supremacist back in 1995.  The reason why we moved is because my wife was burned out treating the general population at Urgent Care.  She couldn't handle them anymore.  And when they are not being racist, they are complaining about Fairfax, taxes, traffic (which is almost nonexistent) and who knows what other things they think matter.  It's just that small town mentality.  They refuse to grow as a community.  Don't want to improve education or help their own people.  All because they are afraid of becoming Fairfax.  I have a small town down the street from me now and it's the same way with those people.

If you don't care about that stuff and you are part of the Q Army or whatever, then you may be right at home in Frederick County.  If that stuff does bother you, I'd stick to Winchester proper.  But then you're dealing with city life.

Anything on the north end of Winchester and points east and you'll see some NOVA style traffic.  Especially along the RT. 7 area as well as other roads heading out of town.  Get away from town on Rt. 50 east of 81 and it turns into beautiful country.

"I'd look into the neighborhoods in Frederick County.  Stephen City was mentioned. I lived it in Stephenson (Snowden Bridge) and that was nice.

If you are going to start a family, I'd recommend moving out of the Winchester area before they get to be school age.  The schools suck.  Locals seem to think the schools are great but their ratings paint a different picture.  That area just isn't very pro-education.

Other than, the lack of good restaurants was disappointing.  There is fast food and mediocre mom and pop restaurants and the typical chains like Chile's and Texas Roadhouse.

There's also a drug problem.  Petty crime is pretty common.  It seemed like cars were getting ransacked in my neighborhood every other week, despite it being a nice neighborhood.

Consider the suburbs around Winchester, as well.  Stephens City in particular is quiet and safe, but still close to everything that Winchester has to offer.

Wherever you check out housing, pay close attention to the internet service available to each house you consider, as it varies widely.  One neighborhood might offer Verizon FIOS (awesome), while the next neighborhood might only have Xfinity cable (decent), and then the next will be too rural to get anything more than DSL.

"I'm not sure about countertops, but I can tell you about my kitchen backsplash installation.  
  
Bought the tile through Lowes, and they subbed the installation out to ServicePros. ServicePros was truly awful. The first installation date never showed up, even though I called the day before and the morning of, to reconfirm that someone was coming. After wasting an entire day waiting for someone to never arrive, I called and complained and got mixed stories about why, so I know someone was lying to me.  
  
We rescheduled, and the tiler did show up. But he was late because his car broke down. No big deal, he got right to work. He set our expectations high, because he boasted that his last job was tiling an entire bathroom for Jon Bon Jovi, or someone else vaguely famous, in NJ. But by the end of the job, we were let down by his skills. He filled in large gaps between tile and cabinets, and tiles and windowsills (3/4"" or more) and we asked why he didn't put in tile. He said he couldn't cut it that small, it kept breaking.  
  
We let him go and immediately asked ServicePros to send out a QA rep and to make things right. They did, and the QA rep said that the tile excuse was simply that, and that any tiler worth their salt could take the extra time to cut down the small pieces and do it right. The QA rep took pictures, documented everything, and confided in me that the initial tiler was a new guy and was worrisome to him, because he flew off the handle and cursed at the QA rep at another job.  
  
Anyway, QA rep returned himself a few weeks later to correct the work of the initial tiler. He was also late, also due to car trouble. It took him all day to pull out the excess grout, repair some cracked tiles we missed, and cut things properly. But he did it. When we stood back and looked at everything... it was fine. Good enough. The wife and I grudgingly agreed it was not an A+ job, but we didn't want anymore hassle or have to use more PTO. The job was initially quoted as a 1-Day Job, and now we were 4 Days Off, all told. We didn't want our kitchen out of commission any more, either.  
  
And ServicePros promised us a refund of some sort. That took a dozen calls, messages left, messages not returned, paperwork sent back and forth, all to get $150 back, which we had to travel to the Lowes Store to get. Another freakin hassle. They made that whole process difficult, I think, to get us to give up, but we didn't, on matter of principle. And stubbornness.

"It’s not really that simple though.

68% of Virginians [support legalization](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/virginia-election-outcome-endangers-marijuana-legalization-rollout/).

The rub for many of us is that this again feels like a vocal minority imposing their will on the majority. It’s especially frustrating when the supposed “party of freedom and personal responsibility” is the one doing it.

Ultimately we will have to see how this develops. The republicans aren’t coming out and saying explicitly that they want to make it illegal again, but they are doing things like making it a class 6 felony if a plant is visible. 

These are the sorts of laws decriminalization was addressing by removing mechanisms where law enforcement can resume using drug enforcement to disproportionately target minority groups and in turn disproportionately strip them of money, freedom, their right to vote, etc.

In other words, this feels more like conservative virtue signaling than an honest attempt to get the sales aspect right, especially considering the republicans had over a year to review the bill and formulate their own plan, which they never did.

"No, you don't understand.  It's not Comcast vs Glo.  It's HFC vs PON Fiber...and you don't seem to understand the difference between HFC and fiber and it's SO so so frustrating.  It can't be helped but that doesn't make it any less frustrating.  I'm glad you are switching now, but it is just so frustrating because it's this ignorance that allowed cable companies to screw all their customers over for about 20 years.  I mean...why should they bother upgrading their network to fiber (which is VASTLY superior) if their customers don't know any better. :\\  the thing is, HFC is unreliable, slow, has very little bandwidth to offer, and it's not as stable.  PON Fiber, on the other hand, is very reliable, extremely fast, has a TON of bandwidth, and it's a much simpler technology and as such is more stable.  It's vastly superior in every way.

"I guess it really depends on a few factors for me: 

1) of by investment you mean literal increase of equity in a home? Buying in Winchester/Fred co is mostly likely going to increase in value more. However, strasburg is growing. You’ll likely get a increase in value that at least matches inflation. 

2) access. Strasburg has less. Less options, less traffic, less people, less resources and opportunities, less. For some that’s a good thing. But there is still some stuff downtown, faster access to outdoor activities. But less events, stores, etc. 

3) culture. Small town but you can get plugged in to some groups. (Following realtors can be helpful since they’re professional networks- they can tell you who is doing what) but this is trump country. Not just red.
Trump. Winchester is not. Frederick county is in between: the closer the houses are to each other the more blue it gets.

My opinion is Winchester for several reasons but chief among them listed above. I will say, you can get more house for the same price in the county. But I’m partial to the city school system.

"They have pallets at about 7 yards that you can staple paper targets to (byo stapler and targets) and there’s plenty of steel silhouettes at about 90-100 yards. I’d usually bring some old campaign signs to set up between the pallets and steel. You can also bring your own stands/steel and tannerite is ok under 1lb (the owners mom lives down the ridge and complains with bigger booms, but the owner is super chill as long as you’re respectful). If you want to shoot clays you’ll need a thrower.

There’s maybe a dozen shooting benches that get pretty busy on nice weekends, but I’ve brought a folding table and set up in between benches without issue. Weekdays are better as there’s no RSO, which is a lot of fun if you get lucky and are out there by yourself

Keep in mind that there’s ~2 miles of mild off roading to get to the range. I wouldn’t recommend going out there in anything lower than a stock suv.

"I am. I only use the archery range though so I can't speak to the quality of the rifle/shotgun areas - they're kind of over this hill and I've never visited them. The archery range is basic - they have styrofoam targets set up against a hill and you can bring your own or just shoot into the foam. I imagine the other ranges are similar (albeit not with styrofoam targets, of course).  I think they do have clay pigeon throwers also but I've never seen them in use.

"Winchester is a great “it could be worse” town. There is nothing exceptional about it but nothing too terrible.

Traffic is frustrating and thick.

"The schools really suck. Last I checked my kids' schools were rated 2/10. That's reflected in the population, which is very uneducated. The people of Winchester largely have no interest in making that town better for fear that it will become like Fairfax County. This includes making schools better. I think it's weird that anytime there is construction everybody hopes it's either a fast food restaurant or a grocery store.

"What I hate most? Housing costs. Very few apartments pop-up under $1000 a month. When they do they are usually gone in a week.

Something it should have: A Panda Express lol We used to have one but it closed down. Now you have to drive to Front Royal. (It’s my favorite) This place also lacks activities relative to a big town with a bunch of stuff to go do. To a certain extent, you have to make your own fun but there are the usual things around. The town is growing so there may be some more stuff pop up in the future.

I will say that despite some people talking about the political demographic you’ll find that mostly everyone around here is friendly except for the occasional group that still hasn’t figured out the south lost the war over a hundred years ago. Crime is rising here though so keep that in mind. Martinsburg has been crime central around here for a while and I think it’s starting to flow over into Winchester. 

This town has a lot of hidden jewels. I’ve lived around here my whole life except for my military time and I swear that every time I drive down Piccadilly St. or walk through the downtown walking mall I find a store that I didn’t know existed. On the outskirts there is West Oaks, which is a very nice farmers market that also does live music and has events all the time. We buy into their co-op and we get fresh vegetables every week as part of it.  

If you have jobs in healthcare then you’re in luck because it’s a healthcare dominated town.

Ultimately, if you’re a family with a very active lifestyle there are much better choices. If you want a town to settle down in that  has that “small sleepy town” vibe while also having a little bit of excitement then Winchester is your ticket.",t2_dt5jiklh,YourMarineBF,0,1643523561.0,0,t1_hutlkln,hutlkln,True,Sarcasm_and_Finesse,t3_sfuf43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winchester/comments/sfuf43/convince_me_not_to_move_to_winchester/,Convince me not to move to Winchester.,/r/Winchester/comments/sfuf43/convince_me_not_to_move_to_winchester/hutlkln/,2,r/Winchester,0,2

"It’s snobby and pretentious.  

Unlike most cities of its size, it’s a completely separate corporate entity, with separate school system, from the surrounding county because, once upon a time, a bigoted judge donated some money to the high school with the stipulation that no “country bumpkin” could ever attend.  Thats what they mean when they say, “An endowed public high school.”

Furthermore, perhaps the most famous person to ever be born there was Country Western singer, Patsy Cline.  How is she remembered?  PATSY CLINE BLVD, began its existence as the access road to the Wal-mart parking lot and, for at least a decade, the signage was misspelled as “PASTY CLINE BLVD.”  The sign is spelled correct, and now it’s the access road to Kohl’s / Books-A-Million so, yay?",t2_3jcuwett,segfalt31337,0,1643519712.0,0,t1_hutew0s,hutew0s,True,Sarcasm_and_Finesse,t3_sfuf43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winchester/comments/sfuf43/convince_me_not_to_move_to_winchester/,Convince me not to move to Winchester.,/r/Winchester/comments/sfuf43/convince_me_not_to_move_to_winchester/hutew0s/,2,r/Winchester,0,2

"The city schools are actually great. They are rated poorly because they have had a massive influx of English Learners year over year to the point the school demo is 40% Hispanic; which is not bad, just means they can’t pass state tests on VA/US history or the English language. They have a brand new innovation center that is a model for the state and country. Currently half of the school is enrolled in a trade class: welding, coding, nursing, pre PA/PT, carpentry, etc. the dual enrollment and college opportunities with LFCC make it so any student that wants to can knock out a year of college for a couple hundred dollars and transfer to any state school. 

Downtown is small but has annual events year round including: lost weekend film fest, skyline film fest, Oktoberfest, Apple Blossom (love it or hate it: a week long festival with parades, carnivals, networking luncheons: essentially a drunk fest but something for everyone), pride fest, wine fests and 6 or so micro breweries. 

There are collections of groups for hobbiests: Alamo film club, dodgeball leagues, ultimate frisbee seasons, night art classes, D&D/gamer events. 

The museum of the Shenandoah valley hosts a series of events year round including free outdoor movie nights and free days to walk the gardens. They also have running trials (free) and there’s running trails on the battlefields. 

The discovery museum is great for kids. It’s large for a town our size. 4 floors and hosts all sorts of events for kiddos. 
There’s affordable horse riding and dance lessons. 

Shenandoah university has scores of concerts snd performances a year for those with a taste for a conservatory. They also have a leading E sports program. Kids are getting full Scholarships. 

Plenty of music, though it’s regionally influenced for sure. 
West Oaks farmers market has highly attended concerts on the weekends in the summer 
And farmers markets everywhere offering seasonal events 
There’s also a great family drive in. 


It was VAs fastest growing area this year. 

There are grocery store and childcare deserts. 

Trumpsters gonna trump. 

Good access to outdoor activities: National Parks, hiking, some climbing, kayaking, fishing, river floats, caverns. 
Drivable to amusement parks and skiing 

Also the views are just damn pretty 

Housing costs are affected by the DC bubble, “pricing out” many who live in west va and commute in but it’s considerably more house for the dollar than “over the mountain” in NOVA. 

I live in the county and have plenty of liberal neighbors but most I don’t know their leanings. And they’re great neighbors. Before living here I knew maybe 2 of my neighbors by name. Now I know dozens and we actually spend time together on the weekends and holidays .

"As someone that just moved six months ago I will try to be objective. 

It’s a small town. If you need more specific medical care, you are likely to need to travel a bit. Traffic isn’t super light even in the middle of the day, which surprised me. The walking mall is kind of small (coming from CO where I had 17th street in Denver and Pearl Street in Boulder). While Winchester city is fairly diverse and liberal with pride flags around, just outside the city is trumpville. Getting to and from the airport kind of sucks; you need a ride or pay to park. A lot of ubers or lyfts will cancel on you because they don’t want to go that far out. The mosquitos suck in the summer. My allergies were not great. The green circle trail needs some work.

"Heya! I live on Virginia ave, very nearby that area!

It's a lively neighborhood for sure. Really diverse, lots of families with kids/teenagers. In the summer you'll hear people playing music during cookouts in their backyard, the occasional firework being set off, and kids riding their bikes all over the place. Personally, I find it quite endearing and have gotten to know a few of my neighbors decently well.

National is a really wide, busy street so if your house is right up on national be ready for some road noise. Charles is a tiny little street that's nicely tucked away.

As far as safety - if you only look at crime rates it is technically one of the highest crime areas in the city, but that isn't saying much because Winchester is overall a very safe city. It's one of those things where 99% of crime in the area is just between people with personal beefs as opposed to any sort of theft/robbery/etc. Been living here for 2 years and haven't experienced anything worse than some kids littering in my front yard.

"Encouraging news for those of us who’ve relied on psilocybin to combat depression, anxiety, and addiction.

I do want to point out the ignorance in this statement from the article: 

“I think it’s ridiculous as a former narcotics detective myself,” Reeves said. “So are we going to do heroin next? Is it OK to do that? I mean where do we draw the line on some of these things?”

For those unfamiliar with psilocybin, this statement is like comparing apples to oranges. Heroin is a highly addictive substance with huge risk for developing a dependency disorder. Psilocybin (active compound in mushrooms) tolerance builds up so fast in your system that it’s widely considered to be non-addictive. In other words, if you take mushrooms today, you’ll get the big psychoactive effects but if you take them again tomorrow or even the next day those same effects will not be felt. There is no physical dependence and no withdrawal. Many folks use them every day to treat cluster headaches and never feel the psychoactive effects.",t2_ah0lj4bz,happy_camper69,0,1642678532.0,0,t1_htg3afo,htg3afo,True,Spicew00d,t3_s8979w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winchester/comments/s8979w/bill_decriminalizing_psychedelic_mushrooms_under/,Bill decriminalizing psychedelic mushrooms under review in Virginia,/r/Winchester/comments/s8979w/bill_decriminalizing_psychedelic_mushrooms_under/htg3afo/,9,r/Winchester,0,9

"I used to live there.  The houses are pretty typical.  Decent floorplans, decent options, but don't be fooled into thinking they are luxury custom homes.  I doubt you'll find anything like that anywhere near Winchester unless you bought a plot of land and worked with an architect directly.

Amenities include trash pickup, pool (with cool pirate ship for the kids), indoor basketball/tennis courts, playground, dog park, nice landscaping in public areas, a few fun events (Easter egg hunt, food trucks, etc).

It's a great place if you are coming from NoVA.  It kind of has that Loudoun County feel with the newer houses, plenty of professionals, and manicured lawns.

The neighbors are mostly cool, social, friendly.  Some neighbors are awful (like anywhere).  A lot of complaining about the HOA (the HOA was fine).  A lot of complaining about the pool not having a heater or being crowded.  It's basically a lot of complaining from people who know nothing about development, construction, houses, traffic studies, and pretty much anything else.

"I don’t live there, but we looked at a house there. There are a lot of community areas (tennis courts, basket ball courts, swimming pools, playground, paths, landscaping, etc.). My guess is about the maintenance there? And when I lived in a townhouse in another state, all exterior maintenance was covered. For $150 I doubt that’s the case, but it some might be part of it. 

While the house we saw was fine, I’ll say it felt very…cookie cutter and new. It could be pretty much anywhere in the country, and was gentrified. And it’s kind of in a little bubble onto itself. You do have the shopping center close by, but I’d not really feel like I live “in Winchester” if I were 15 minutes out that way. Which is fine, but after having lived in a community like that previously, was not for us and we preferred something with a bit more charm, more mature trees, and a little flavor. 

I’ll also say if the townhouses we saw being built, a lot are really ugly. Like, rows of flat rectangles. Nice size, but again, as someone who happily live in a townhouse for years, not my favorite.

"Cordial Coffee in Berryville is also good, if a little bit of a drive. I prefer their beans to Hopscotch, but Hopscotch has a better vibe with the record store too.

For booze, my regular breweries are Broken Window downtown, Escutcheon just out of downtown and (my favorite) Backroom Brewery near Middletown. The last is kind of an oddball place, half brewery half greenhouse, but great beer. Glen Manor and Rappahannock are go-to wineries, some of the closer ones seem to have kinda gone downhill lately (James Charles and Valerie Hill). Linden is a class above most everything else around here.

Tbh, the food around here isn't that great. Taqueria Guadalajara is good for Mexican, otherwise I default to places like Paladin in Stephens City, Pavemint in Front Royal. Village Square downtown and Regions 117 in Lake Frederick are alright for nicer spots. Vibrissa in FR is pretty good, and they are supposed to open a new place in the old Winchester Star building downtown.

Personally I wouldn't worry about this choice too much if you find neighborhood and budget situation you like.",t2_4gzyhkk0,sporkityfork,0,1636762909.0,0,t1_hkee2sz,hkee2sz,True,happy_camper69,t3_qshl5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winchester/comments/qshl5n/stephens_city/,Stephens City,/r/Winchester/comments/qshl5n/stephens_city/hkee2sz/,2,r/Winchester,0,2
"Came up here from ShenCo (shudder).  Wifey wanted to move to Winchester, but I didn't want to deal with the extra traffic.  Roads around Exit 313 get congested and try my patience.  We landed in Stephens City, just outside the Town of Stephens City, in a new neighborhood.  After 2.5 yrs, we are still happy with this choice.

If you move to Stephens City, I might mention: We're not getting double-taxed, because we're not **In Town**.  Yes, we have a Stephens City address, and we're right off the highway and we're close to fast food/Starbucks/Ace Hardware/pharmacies.  But we only pay taxes to Frederick County, and not also to the Town of Stephens City.  So maybe shop Stephens City real estate on the east side of the interstate...

We can get Verizon FIOS.  This is the best internet for the money, so check the internet availability wherever you search.  Xfinity Cable internet is alright, but pales in comparison to FIOS, which is as low as $40/mo.

If we want Winchester fun, it's just up the road.  We were always driving hella far from ShenCo to get to Winchester for good eats and the OTW and other culture.  Now, we're 10 minutes away from alla that.  It's no big deal.  We go there every weekend.  And if the interstate gets clogged, there are plenty of back roads to get to Costco or the WMC.

We compared house prices between SC and Winch, and Winch costs more.  Now house prices are going up, so it's not going to be cheap anywhere, but we built new with a big developer, and then noticed that the same developer was building in Winchester, same houses, for $100k more than here.  We saved a lot of dough by landing here.",t2_cf26a,leo_nears_jerusalem,0,1636762110.0,0,t1_hkecehx,hkecehx,True,happy_camper69,t3_qshl5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winchester/comments/qshl5n/stephens_city/,Stephens City,/r/Winchester/comments/qshl5n/stephens_city/hkecehx/,2,r/Winchester,0,2

"So, obviously a lot is opinion-based but here’s mine… Frederick County schools in general are better than Winchester city schools, but neither are particularly great. Most neighborhoods in Steven city or Winchester are going to be fine for high speed internet, at least Comcast or FiOS… With glofiber rapidly expanding. As soon as you get even remotely rural outside of either town, high speed Internet dies. As somebody else said, food sucks in Steven city, Winchester definitely has more local/mom-and-pop offerings.

"I love how they ask for feedback on the projects.  They never listen to that feedback, but they want it.  People gave feedback specifically saying the mess of construction on 277 in Stephens City wouldn't help anything and, of course, they didn't listen.

People have told them to have cops stationed at the lights at 11 and 277 in Stephens City and at the light next to Sheetz/Exxon before the bridge at 81 and 277 in Stephens City.  That would cut down on cars and big rigs blocking the intersection.  They haven't listened to that either.
