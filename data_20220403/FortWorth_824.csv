"I only moved to Fort Worth 6 months ago so my knowledge of this city is lacking. I just enjoy reading about urban things as a hobby.

It seems like most US cities haven't had a lot of luck putting 100% of their effort on downtown mall retail catering to suburban daytrippers since the 1980s. Having draws like events, music, conventions, sports, etc all help bring people to downtown and catalyze growth but it isn't enough by itself. Minneapolis' Nicollet Street is now a shell of its former self and San Diego's Horton Plaza has been demolished. Dallas had the West End which, exists? Denver's 16th street mall and LoDo is still going strong, but Denver has a relatively high downtown population for a city of it's size (IIRC it's something like 75,000 people living in the core and adjacent neighborhoods). Denver is a good peer role model for Fort Worth, in a perfect world it's what central FW could look like in 25 years.

Downtown Fort Worth should focus on small actionable changes like getting retail spaces filled, offices leased, and giving people a reason to live and hang around downtown, and then occasionally having big events that draw in crowds and help enhance its reputation and popularity. Then over time everything else is organic.",t2_furlg,steavoh,0,1649005278.0,0,t1_i38rciz,i38rciz,False,Doesnt-CheckOut,t3_tu4e9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tu4e9t/with_all_of_the_talk_about_sundance_square_whats/,"With all of the talk about Sundance Square, what’s going on with these upcoming competing art festivals?",/r/FortWorth/comments/tu4e9t/with_all_of_the_talk_about_sundance_square_whats/i38rciz/,1,r/FortWorth,0,1

"This is the way.  Without a doubt.  YOU can determine the kinds of people that you hang out with, and if you're going to choose to do things only online, the chances of authenticity are not zero but probably quite low. If you use an app that specializes in hookups, then that's what you'll get.  If you use an app at all, you miss the human element.

Keep your expectations on-level with what you're willing to put in.  If you're only willing to do it from behind a keyboard, expect a long hard slog.  If you're willing to meet face-to-face with people and are willing to actually initiate conversations (you call yourself anti-social, which means that even YOU recognize where changes need to happen), you're on a road to finding folks that you can call friends.

A lot of changes are happening here. For better and worse. Drama with downtown, West 7 has no parking and overall crime is rising. 

There are a lot of apartment communities around the Trinity that are great for easy access to the trails. 

West 7 has lots of apartments and is close to bars, restaurants, gym and Trinity Park

Sasha Bass & Co, who own Sundance Square, wanted Main St Arts Festival (MSAF) to have more local artists.  MSAF said that's not the point of the festival - it's to bring other artists to FtW to showcase their stuff (bring more culture to the area), and already has a process to allow local artists into the more affordable booths.  MSAF wouldn't compromise their selection process; Bass wouldn't stop trying to force them to do things Bass' way, so MSAF can't use Sundance Square.  Sasha Bass decided to host their own arts festival showcasing local artists in Sundance Square at the same time.

&nbsp;

My personal take...

On one hand, it's nice for local artists to have more opportunities to show their stuff.  On the other hand, that's not the point of MSAF.  And my personal opinion is that Sasha Bass was likely trying to force MSAF to include Sasha's hand-picked artists (likely friends of the Basses or other nepotism/cronyism Bass-picked artists), and MSAF was like ""No, that's not how this works; we have a panel that decides who gets in"".  So Sasha got all pissy and said ""I'm taking my ball and going home!"" like a 5 year old.",t2_k3ttn,atthem77,0,1648912844.0,0,t1_i347bqf,i347bqf,True,Doesnt-CheckOut,t3_tu4e9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tu4e9t/with_all_of_the_talk_about_sundance_square_whats/,"With all of the talk about Sundance Square, what’s going on with these upcoming competing art festivals?",/r/FortWorth/comments/tu4e9t/with_all_of_the_talk_about_sundance_square_whats/i347bqf/,13,r/FortWorth,0,13

"Yup, but those were planned before the pandemic economic collapse, and in anticipation of the Fort drawing more high paying jobs.

As with the Panther Island development scam, it's too late to back out now. They've set that course and must see it through. 

The city cleared out the unsightly poors (which includes me and my neighbors) to prettify downtown.  The side effect is to make the burbs less attractive (with the exception of Benbrook, for now... but it's not immune to the effect that's hit much of Fort Worth) to folks incoming from other states. And high gas prices make commuting to distant McMansions outside Tarrant County expensive.

"I attached some photos of my backyard- and my two dogs— Pepper and Duke, but now:

I’ll introduce myself!

My name is Ali.
I’m reaching closer and closer to thirty years old, and have spent the last almost six years in the professional animal care world, as a kennel technician at both dog boarding and dog daycare facilities. (Before this I was a bat caretaker at bat world and I adored it!)

I am CPR certified. I’ve taken care of and loved on all kinds of animals! Especially dogs and kitties. (From the shy and reserved ones, to the more social and energetic ones, to the older, calmer ones, to the aggressive ones who need some extra love and care! I do not discriminate against breeds, behavioral issues, or sizes. I’ve met some of the most loving and wonderful dogs! Some of the most loving just happened to have also been aggressive when I first met them, with rough pasts.) Throughout my journey and experience— I’ve truly gained so much patience, compassion, and professional experience. I treat each and every pet that I’m blessed enough to care for, as my own. Lots of love, snuggles, treats (if allowed- I am aware that some have allergies and/or strict diets!), and nature time— whether your dog likes to sunbathe— or race around and play- I accommodate each pet by their owner’s requests, and needs. 

Safety, comfort, and happiness are my top priorities for each and every animal. 
When experiencing new people and/or places— our pets tend to get anxious— me, being someone who’s struggled a lot of my life with anxiety, and trauma— I go above and beyond to comfort and care for your animals. 
In fact, I stayed working at kennels far too long because of how much I care- I just haven’t yet found a kennel to pour my all into, one that has people who work and care for the dogs, the way that I do—so for a second job I decided to gain a few clients that I can accommodate for walks, petsitting, and/or house sitting. (With house sitting, I offer to do basic cleanings, and scooping the yard, as a bonus, no extra charge)

I just recently made a Rover account, but if you’d prefer— you can always message me for my other contact information. I know that there are some people who are struggling financially, but still need animal care— I am willing to work with you on plans and pricing. 💗

I’ve attached my Rover link: with my code— if you use my code you get $20 off :)

In the future, should this be approved to be done automatically without consent, just turn off the wifi and use it as a regular programmable thermostat. Or disable the feature. 

I know Honeywell has partners in Texas (unsure if it ERCOT, Oncor or the specific retail providers), that did a big push last year to setup the automated response during statewide peaks (I assume honeywell gets a rebate for helping to lower the state peak). With that initiative, there were clear warnings on the website/app allowing the opt-in.

"If you buy or pick up any used furniture check it for bedbugs. Especially upholstered furniture. But even plain wood can hide the critters in crevices. 

That's why furniture pickings are slim at thrift stores and resale shops.

If the furniture is nice enough it's relatively easy to kill the bedbugs. Steam heat from a clothing de wrinkling wand, or rented steamer, will do. Cimexa dust for long-term prevention. It's just amorphous silica gel, a simple desiccant, not toxic to people or pets. Bedbugs have a waxy exoskeleton. The Cimexa dust sticks to their bodies and dries them out within 24-72 hours.

Bedbugs are easy to spot. Use a flashlight or other bright light to check under and behind furniture, every crevice where they can hide. If the infestation is more than a week old they'll leave distinctive poop spots. Depends on whether they've had access to people or pets for feeding. They also smell bad, if your sense of smell is keen enough. Like stink bugs.

They slurp blood, but as far as entomology researchers can tell do not carry or transmit bloodborne diseases. They're just annoying.

I only mention this better l because the DFW area has seen a fluctuating increase in bedbugs over the past decade. Currently it seems to be in a bit of decline. It's not a hygiene or housekeeping issue. Bedbugs don't care about anything but our tasty, tasty blood. They can hitchhike on any transportation: planes, taxis, buses, common seating areas. But 

Not trying to sell anything. I used to work in pest control. TBH, you can do a better DIY job with steam heat and Cimexa than most pest control companies who mostly just spray ineffective pyrethrins. Bedbugs have acquired immunity to most sprays. You can do better yourself.

"The Islamic Center of Watauga had its first family night event in two years on March 25. Syed Mansoor, the lead board member at the mosque, said the mosque’s congregation was excited to be back.   
  
“The plan is to fully enjoy this Ramadan, have full activities, but keep an eye on COVID as well,” Mansoor said.   
  
The month of Ramadan is set to mark the full return of in-person gatherings and events for the Muslim community since the pandemic started two years ago. Beginning at sundown on April 2, most Muslims, like Mujeeb Kazi and his 13-year old son, have begun preparing for Ramadan.   
  
During this year’s month of Ramadan, Kazi and his son have goals. For Kazi, he plans to read the 604-page long Quran from cover to cover — at least twice. His son is working on memorizing verses of the Quran to recite during prayer times. They see this as a way to show gratitude for God’s blessings.   
  
“There’s a verse in the Quran that tells us that God rewards you according to your willingness,” said Kazi, president of the North Texas Islamic Council. “In the month of Ramadan, the underlying idea is to have yourself practice and get yourself used to it in a way that for the rest of the year, you’ll be a good human, a good Muslim.”",t2_ciwuwdza,fortworthreport,0,1648829565.0,0,t1_i2zzafh,i2zzafh,True,fortworthreport,t3_ttuj8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/ttuj8z/fort_worths_muslim_community_looks_forward_to/,Fort Worth’s Muslim community looks forward to Ramadan as pandemic restrictions ease up,/r/FortWorth/comments/ttuj8z/fort_worths_muslim_community_looks_forward_to/i2zzafh/,4,r/FortWorth,0,4

"https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1596/masterpiece-cakeshop-v-colorado-civil-rights-commission

I searched up the case, although the majority opinion by the supreme court was the following: 

>“When it comes to weddings, it can be assumed that a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the **free exercise of religion**,” which would be protected by the free exercise clause.

They also commented on a similar topic you brought up regarding the differences from discrimination based on race - although they took this as a failure on behalf of Colorado's commission to treat the case neutraly as they would with other cases where bakers refused to put obscene messages on cakes.

>members of the commission had expressed negative animus toward Phillips’ religious beliefs rather than treating them with the neutrality that the free exercise clause required.  One of the board members had compared Phillips’ rationale to justifications for slavery and the Holocaust, and no one on the Commission took issue with the statement.

>Moreover, the Commission had treated Phillips differently than it had treated other bakers who had refused to prepare cakes with derogatory messages directed against same-sex unions. 

The Supreme Court ruled on the basis of the *free exercise clause* for the *first amendment* that 

>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...

The case was supported under *free speech* and *freedom of religion* both of which fall under the *first amendement*.

>But how is it different than a buisness saying no blacks, if the city the buisness is in specifically protects sexual orientation. 

From the Supreme Court's ruling, this is differenet because the bakery was **not refusing** to sell equivalent products to the same-sex couple, they were okay with selling non-custom cakes to the couple that did not require the baker to use their art/artistic expression to write out a statement that went against their personal convictions. *Whereas refusing business (not selling any products and/or services) to a protected class* would be considered discrimination (e.g. if the baker refused to sell all products/services)

>Commissioners had cited evidence in the latter case that the bakers were willing to sell other products to prospective customers but had discounted the fact that Phillips had also expressed willingness to sell non-custom creations to gays.

It seems like the baker was willing to accomodate the same-sex couple by selling them a cake that had no specific same-sex message. Thus, it would not be the same as refusing business to a protected class. 

I disagree with the wedding venue's policy of no refunds for same-sex couples that booked - although I believe any business (weddings inherently involve marriage) should be able to dictate their own policy that does not go against their personal convictions whether religiois or secular in nature. This is why I mentioned *discrimination is legal* under various circumstances. If you ran a wedding venue and a client wanted you to design their event with obscene decorations - you would have the same legal protections to refuse it. Similarly, businesses can discriminate against soliciters, people with certain clothing or lack thereof, and a ton of other things. Although equating discrimination of people who have no shirts entering a store with refusing business to people of a specific race are two different things, even if they both involve varying degrees of discrimination",t2_802xe4bd,ChaoticHelios,0,1648798066.0,0,t1_i2yfmg6,i2yfmg6,False,Sharktosaurus,t3_tn80hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tn80hf/roots_venue_in_fort_worth_recently_updated_their/,Roots venue in Fort Worth recently updated their Same Sex policy on their website.

"Christians do not follow most Jewish laws, customs and traditions, although they obv borrow heavily the Jewish Torah - the religion itself builds on top of Jewish history and the same Jewish figures you mentioned are derived from the Old Testament. In the religion Christians follow the teachings of Jesus (New Testament), and as mentioned - it either reinforces certain laws from before or completely overrides them as the religion views Judaism and straying from what they percieve to be the truth. 

I do cringe when I see people mention anything within the OT and assume Christians are somehow breaking their alleged laws that they should follow. Many people who cherry pick clothing standards, dietary restrictions, incest, etc. will get most of those verses from the first 5 books of the bible (Genesis through Deutoronomy) which are exactly the same as the Jewish Torah, or within the OT. 

That would be like telling a Muslim that they break their own laws by not following Kosher (Jewish dietary standards). Religions build on top of eachother. There is a reason why Buddhism does not equate to Hinduism, Judaism isn't Zoroastrian, Islam isn't Christian.

Just wanted to mention it as both sides (religious and irreligious) seem to not know the specifics of the belief system (some christians will regurgitate the claim that ""we [they] don't even follow our own rules like wearing <clothing item> or eating <food>."" That isn't to say that Christians always follow everything the bible mandates, although I'd go as far as claiming an overwhelming majority of Christian branches/sects do not believe there is any validity for supporting those things, and they'll use historical context (e.g. marrying a family member was commok in those times but that does not equate to it being allowed or supported by the bible).

I have similar discussions with people on Islam, as they'll misconstrue the quran and hadiths and somehow conclude that Muslims worship Muhammad or other non-existent claims (typically they get this info from others in-person or online, and will take it as some sort of undeniable fact because it is regurgitated so many times - think of the carrot improving eyesight myth)",t2_802xe4bd,ChaoticHelios,0,1648795778.0,0,t1_i2ycpsb,i2ycpsb,False,Sharktosaurus,t3_tn80hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tn80hf/roots_venue_in_fort_worth_recently_updated_their/,Roots venue in Fort Worth recently updated their Same Sex policy on their website.

"""Iran is a former Soviet state""

Wut?

Also, no, the point of the whole deal is to insure AMERICAN peace with Iran, and even that aspect of it has been unilaterally seen as a complete failure so far, as Iran has made 0 realistic concessions to this point and yet the US has admitted it is willing to make several. All we've managed to do so far is drive the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and even ISRAEL away from the US' sphere of influence. The reason we pulled out in the first place was bc Iran was not acting in good faith; though they were not actively looking into uranium enrichment at the time, they were still actively and publicly researching  and experimenting with payloads for nuclear weapons a-la ICBMs. If they already have dirty nukes as you say, why on earth would we want them developing ICBMs to put them on??? 

Your statement about Russia holding complete power in the middle east is entirely false, as well. The US has airbases and/or major influence in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and half of the other Arabian nations. If you recall, we just GAVE UP another middle eastern nation in Afghanistan, but that one happened under a specific other president than Trump;) Russian involvement in Syria started in 2011 and was considered a full scale military invasion for them by 2015, again, not under Trump, and not until a couple of weeks ago did the Saudis and Emiratis start threatening that they were go to start looking at taking Chinese Yuan for oil in addition to the traditionally accepted US Dollar.

"The deal was a joint venture between the U.S, Iran and Russia. Russia was the go between for negotiations with the US and Iran. They already provide the market majority for Uranium and Iran is a former Soviet state so that's make sense. The U.S will provide the logistics and support to build their nuclear program. The point of the whole deal was to insure peace. Iran already has dirty nukes. Their nuclear development would be on sovereign ground, aka U.S territory. Iran would develop nuclear weapons without the help from the U.S but to avoid war the brokered the nuclear deal. Now Russia is the sole contributer to logistics and negotiations. That means no U.S ops. No U.S interference and no justification to interfere. Russia holds complete power in the middle east and it happened in the 4 years Trump was president.

"Idk what you're talking about, 4 out of the only 5 police officers who were even linked to these events that have passed away committed suicide in the weeks after, not at the riot itself. The other one died of natural causes, per the medical examiner, the next day following complications from 2 strokes. This is the closest you'll find to anyone saying an officer died from these events, as the medical examiner is quoted as saying that the strokes were likely at least in part due to the stress induced by the riot (He is also quoted however, as stating that there was no blunt force trauma to the officer anywhere on his body, contrary to immediate reports afterwards by certain news outlets stating that he was thought to have been hit with a fire extinguisher). On the other hand, 1 lady did get shot BY police, 1 protestor was trampled, 1 from heart complications prior to the storming of the capitol, and 1 from an accidental OD.

I'm a member of the FW Foodies group on Facebook and I remember people discussing this move a few months ago, so I definitely wasn't surprised to see the news today either.

"What grades are your kids in?

I’ll go ahead and recommend Grapevine-Colleyville ISD since that’s my home district. Though if you’re looking for an elementary school, the ones on the Colleyville side (Colleyville Elem, Bransford, Taylor, Heritage, Glenhope) are going to be better than the Grapevine ones (Timberline, Dove, Silverlake, Grapevine Elem, Bear Creek). But it’s going to be tough to find a house under $500K zoned for the Colleyville schools. But they’re out there. Cannon Elementary in Grapevine is pretty good. 


Birdville and HEB are solid, but I don’t feel they are quite up to GCISD level. Again, depends on the individual school. Keller is good, but I don’t know much about it.

"There is a huge misconception about urban schools and their qualities. It's [been found](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09645299900000018) that family and neighborhood influence about 60% of student test scores, as opposed to 10% influenced by teachers.

Suburban schools are in suburbs, which are predominantly white and affluent. So it's no surprise that schools in suburbs post higher test scores than schools in communities with a greater population of impoverished families.

Ultimately no matter what school district you are part of, the resources available to students to achieve their greatest potential are roughly the same, though more diverse schools tend to have a stronger impact on students.

This applies to the college acceptance rate too, it's not so much about the education there, but the type of families that attend. That's not even to mention the fact that college isn't the only path to success, and is increasingly becoming a path to fruitless prospects and debt, unlike career schools.

Instead of looking at the school district itself, look at the communities you'll be part of. Does it make sense to be part of the affluent, white, suburb communities? At first, it might seem like it, but suburban communities stifle independence. Public transportation and access to non-residential zones are paramount to a child's creativity and exploration. Car dependence locks you into a financial burden that is a must to leave your community.

"Sadly, as a Fort Worth lifer and very active person it’s the one thing the city is missing-ish. They are trying really hard IMO to move to that “city style”. There are a lot more bike rental stations going up, the trinity trails are well maintained and provide lots of miles of walking/jogging/biking. There are quite a few mountain biking trails also (sansom park is my personal favorite). Plus more and more rock climbing gyms plus lots of fun classes oh like yoga in the Foundry district! I miss water the most. It’s the hardest to find a river or creek that’s near by to go and swim in that you feel is safe water. The lakes are great but it’s still missing that fresh water feeling (I hope this makes since-I am Stoney baloney:))We travel a lot to the better, cleaner lakes and it helps. possum kingdom lake isn’t that far and it is so increasingly beautiful and a really fun place to outdoor it up! 

The Austin and surrounding areas are great for all outdoor activities too! So much to do. Oh Denton is great too, a mini Austin almost and only 45 minutes from Fort Worth.

"Going from Wyoming to Fort Worth is like going from Willy Wonka's chocolate factory to a canned broccoli warehouse. No color here. No mountains. The best part of Fort Worth is the cost of living.

That said, to make it tolerable, you can live in -- or often visit -- Eagle Mountain Lake, which has a few marinas, lake-view restaurants, and a lakeside beach. Arlington is a bit more interesting. There's River Legacy park for mountain biking and paved trails and playgrounds. There's a beach and marina nearby (Lynn Creek at Joe Pool Lake). Arlington also has a good variety of shops and restaurants, and it is a good location for commuting to both Fort Worth and Dallas. 

Avoid south Fort Worth, east fort worth, and downtown as far as places to live and school districts. They are all good to visit, though.

"To OP, Former teacher for FWISD here.
Fort Worth is the major school district, and will have a Ton of resources. However, they also have the larger population, so a lot of those resources get diluted.

Grapevine Colleyville ISD is probably one of the best districts for resource to student ratio, and they have a solid reputation, but Southlake is definitely the cream of the crop there if you are looking for status in extra curriculars.

Coppell is a fantastic ISD, and home prices may seem high, but the central location to North burbs of DFW is honestly worth any additional drive, as most traffic will be heading North in the AM, and South in the PM. So you will basically half your travel time anywhere.

I am currently in the EMSISD location, and TBH, it's a little more exclusive and what I would term, backwoods, when compared to North DFW ISDs, but nothing like the south DFW ISDs. Dont get me wrong, Saginaw is a Great place to live, and pretty affordable. Personally, i think it will be the next Grapevine TX in about a decade. But, I mean South for the entire metroplex, like Mesquite which is South Dallas, Arlington, Mansfield, Burleson, almost all of which will include Agriculture as a career path, as opposed to the tech centric focus in the north. 

I do recommend you consider which of these schools have graduation rates and college acceptance rates. Some private schools, like Nolan Catholic, have a nearly 98% college acceptance rate, as opposed to the more urban school districts. Some locations just are better at sending thier kids to college or alternative programs, like welder, CPA, Law Enforcement and Medical programs and certificates (those last two ate FWISDs bread and butter, they even partner w/ the local Community college for college credits and advanced pathways).

It's going to take a little extra leg work, but your kids are worth it, right?

"Demand for child care has been high in recent years. Yet, the industry does not have enough workers, and child care providers cannot offer higher salaries or else risk pricing out many low-income parents. And this was all happening before the COVID-19 pandemic.

The average cost of child care for an infant in Texas is $9,324 annually. For a 4-year-old child, that figure decreases to $7,062. The high costs means child care is often out of reach for low-wage workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
