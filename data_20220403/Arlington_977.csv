"One of my favorite dive bars is Caves off Division St.  It's the epitome of dive, but they have great drinks, great prices, and really cool 'lounge' vibe.

No Frills Grill off Little Road is my favorite sports bar ever.  TV's everywhere, but (as the name suggests) it isn't over polished and gimmicky.  Food is good and cheap, they have dozens off craft beer on tap for perhaps the best price in the whole city.  Velvet Hammer and Blood & Honey are both $4/pint.  I haven't see that anywhere else.  

J.

Dumping them at a shelter even if it is no kill is cruel. No kill shelters are often even more over crowded and chaotic, and they have so many other animals they’re trying to help.

"I thought there were a few of the guys involved in the group that were lawyers, hence ""Legal Draft,"" and they had hired a pedigreed brewmaster to start. We went a couple of years back and things seemed...a bit off. As it turned out, original brewmaster left Legal for other opportunities and confirmed our suspicions. Things leveled out, though.  

Being high-powered attorneys certainly helps the networking game, plus it helps you understand the ins and outs of the permitting, licensing, real estate, all that. Especially if you're able to lobby the city to help develop a part of town historically reserved for used car and impound lots. 

They did have a bit of meteoritic rise, a quick ascension in the ranks compared to other local operations, but they did all that without the help of a Miller Coors or AB InBev cash infusion. Like hey, I hate Rage Against the Machine's music, but I respect the hustle. 

A lot of your sentiment is subjective, and speculation---there's no official statement out there claiming anything one way or the other. Some have speculated that the landlord gave them boot for nonpayment, and that wouldn't surprise me given how rents have skyrocketed. 

Who knows, maybe the most reasonable explanation is they couldn't dig themselves out of the initial investment, like you mentioned---a canning line is one hell of an investment. They had the operational capacity to become a regional force but it seems the retail side fell by the wayside. Had they a smaller, less expensive operation, they'd probably be just fine.

"Because it's mediocre beer. There was always really fishy about Legal Draft. I washed huge into the craft beer scene before I developed liver issues. I followed along with breweries struggling to open up around Arlington, Pantego, Grand Prairie, Mansfield, etc. 
 
It's a very long, arduous process. Takes years. There's licensing and regulations and equipment and then building word of mouth in a metroplex perfectly happy with Miller Lite. 
 
But Legal Draft came out of nowhere and were up and running in months. I believe at least one of the founders was a lawyer. And they've got a sweet spot, an amazing property in a great location. And then just as quickly, they were named the city's official beer, and got an exclusive deal with the Rangers. 
 
They scored city event after city event. They showed up in grocery stores and liquor shops. Meanwhile, a single canning machine is a considerable investment for any other micro brewery. 
 
And their beer was so generic and mediocre. I get taste is subjective, but again - it didn't come anywhere CLOSE to the level of quality put out by other local brewer that actually cared about the beer. 
 
I think Legal Draft was exploiting some sort of relationship with the right people in city government to capitalize on the craft beer craze, and now they're seeing the trend is fading and it's time to cash out.

* **Game Over Videogames** on 4648 S Cooper St (across the highway from Movie Trading Company): Similar used-games store, but focused exclusively on games and tends to have a good selection. Their prices are a bit higher though. 
* **Free Play** on 400 E South St (downtown): Retro arcade full of 80s/90s cabinets. There's a $12 admission fee and all the games there are free to play. They stay open till 11pm on weekdays and till 2am on Friday and Saturday (21+ only after 9pm though).

"Doesn’t look like it from my side, but here ya go:

Basically title. 

I have a 12 mo lease for a one bed/one bath apartment for about $1200/mo that starts middle of next month. Water is split between residents, electricity is your own. They said if you’re looking for a bigger apartment they would do a small discount on the rent for it if you pick this lease up (they feel sorry for me, I was looking at moving to that area but now I really don’t have a reason to be up there and add a commute to my work). Dogs and cats are welcome, limit of two. I’ve already paid deposit for two animals, and would be happy to apply it towards your lease if you take it. 

It’s a nice apartment in a decent area, and tbh I was really looking forward to it but life had other plans.

"Definitely check out Texas Live. I hate sports but it blew my mind. Miller Tavern has the best food. 

Downtown: 4 Kahunas is a cool place to get creative drinks. Please support our local coffee shops Saltar Bros and Inclusion Coffee. Other local spots to hit: Hurtado, Sugar Bee, On Tap, Legal Draft (there’s an axe throwing place in that complex), Division Brewing.

As far as accommodation for Wrestlemania: the Holiday Inn Express is solid and affordable, as well as a 5 minute drive (30 minute walk, it’s long but I’ve done it) from the stadium. However, it may book up quickly.

If you prefer to stay outside of Arlington and want to party in Dallas, maybe check out Las Colinas, there are several quality hotels there. 

Staying in Dallas: Hotel Indigo is great if you want to party and stay in Dallas. The gayborhood (Oak Lawn) is honestly the most fun, uptown is really nice if you want to be bougie, Cowboys Red River if you want the full yeehaw deal (note: not a safe area so don’t go wandering but there is a Pappas Bros Steakhouse right there and it is quite excellent)

"Just vibes really.  They all have 'bar hopping' potential with places to eat and walk around to.  Deep Ellum is the rowdy part of town.  Think 'Bourbon Street' type of ambiance and energy.  Good food, good drinks, good venues.  Bishop Arts is a bit more gentrified.  It get's pretty active when the sun goes down, but it's more tame than Deep Ellum.  Places like Greenville Ave and McKinney Ave are where the SMU college kids will most likely be.  Affluent areas with great places to eat, but the ""rambunctious"" behavior is mostly subdued.  Granted, it's been a long time since I've been in that part of town, but SMU is like 10 minutes away so I doubt that's changed much.  

If yall are staying Friday-Monday, I'd say check out Uptown (Greenville,McKinney) on Friday night to have a good time and not get too out of hand, and then hit up Deep Ellum Saturday night for some fun.  Sunday, I'd say go walk around Bishop Arts for some day drinking and brunching.  If you can manage to sneak all 3 areas in 3 days, you've done well.  

Ubering is ubering.  If you're trying to leave when everyone else is, then you'll probably wait a bit.  In my experience, it's not the waiting that gets me, it's the after hours surcharge.  

My two cents, I assume you'll want to head to Arlington early for Wrestlemania, so when you get here, do some pregaming at Texas Live if you have the money.  If you want something cheaper, head to downtown for J. Gilligans.  They might even shuttle you to and from the stadium.",t2_isnp1,Chasethelogic,0,1646598281.0,0,t1_hzm8ga2,hzm8ga2,False,[deleted],t3_t86cr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/arlington/comments/t86cr9/bachelor_party_help/,Bachelor party help,/r/arlington/comments/t86cr9/bachelor_party_help/hzm8ga2/,5,r/arlington,0,5
"We are definitely leaning Dallas.

What’s the main difference between Deep Ellum/Bishops Arts/Greenville in terms of the types of bars and the scene? We are not a rowdy bunch but we also aren’t quiet if that makes sense, we like to drink and have a good time. 

Also how are Ubers down there? Easy and abundant or a pain to get?

Also thank you very much that was very helpful.",t2_ue6c7d3,Ashlarry88,0,1646597691.0,0,t1_hzm7536,hzm7536,False,[deleted],t3_t86cr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/arlington/comments/t86cr9/bachelor_party_help/,Bachelor party help,/r/arlington/comments/t86cr9/bachelor_party_help/hzm7536/,3,r/arlington,0,3
"So, this will be up to your preference, but Arlington may not be where you want to get a place to stay.  There are no ABnB's allowed, and the nightlife is much to be desired.  That being said, there are several districts in Dallas and Fort Worth that could accommodate you.  Look up the ""night life"" areas in both cities to see what sounds best.  West 7th is pretty typical club music, loud, bar hopping kind of thing.  Good places to eat and have a good time within a mile of each other.  Greenville, Bishop Arts, and Deep Ellum will be the place to be in Dallas.  For what it's worth, you'll probably hear some wet logs complain about the ""shadiness"" of Deep Ellum, but as long as you're not looking for trouble, it's a lot of fun.  It is always full of people, clubs, bars, venues, restaurants, and tattoo shops if that's your thing.  Deep Ellum also has my favorite burger (Twisted Root) and brisket (Pecan Lodge).  Pecan Lodge will always have a line, but if you order 5lbs of meat or more, you can use the express lane.  I highly recommend it for some good TX BBQ.  

My overall suggestion would be to stay in either Dallas or Ft Worth and find a way to get transported to ATT stadium for Wrestlemania.  Have a good time, Uber on back to your hotel, and then hit the nightlife as desired.  If you happen to choose Fort Worth, check out Salsa Limon for tacos, Enchiladas Ole for Tex Mex, Heim BBQ or Cowtown BBQ for BBQ, and get yourself some margaritas from Chimis in the West 7th Area.

Once youth basketball is over, First Baptist Church Arlington has a group on Monday evening.

"Late to the thread, but I've been keeping tabs. Interesting developments these past 2 months.

Texas 2nd Court of Appeals heard oral arguments from Robert Jordan and AISD in January. IIRC, the judges seemed confused about what AISD wanted from the legal system in the case. 

[https://www.txcourts.gov/2ndcoa/practice-before-the-court/oral-arguments/2022/](https://www.txcourts.gov/2ndcoa/practice-before-the-court/oral-arguments/2022/)

Channel 8 did a pretty good job laying out the arguments/developments. It's mentioned in their write-up but worth saying here: AISD quietly published a fact sheet about the suit, essentially claiming RJ overcharged them. RJ told WFAA they offered him a ""sweetheart deal"" and should've charged them $2 million.

"The Arlington Fire Code stipulates that fire sprinklers in R3 structures are not required if the property has an approved fire department access (a road, parking lot, or driveway on which they can drive a pumper truck to put out the fire).

There is no provision in the Fire Code requiring extinguishers in residential units. That is between you and your landlord.

We did change the batteries on move in, but I appreciate the tip. The alarms beep when tested.

"So sorry to hear that! I hope no one was hurt/killed in the fire!

Not sure what fire code, but I am pretty sure that they need to have working smoke alarms in all of the apartments. As a tenant, you want to make sure to test them when you first move in and confirm if they are hard wired/battery operated. If battery operated, you might want to pop in a new one when you move in. Most people rent for just a year at a time.

As far as sprinkler systems, again, not sure, but it may depend on when they were built.

"Okay brief recap; At the time of the accident road was named Arlington-Bedford. Later on road was renamed Greenbelt Rd. One of these images is a screenshot of Google Earth showing site of wreck (circled in red) where the dead branch of Greenbelt meets the railroad track. You can see the drainage ditch that parallels the RR track; this was traversed by a wooden bridge at the time of the wreck in 1961. That bridge was replaced by one made of large concrete drainage pipes and built up with asphalt. That is what is there today. I assume. These pictures are 10-12 years old. Most are oriented looking north. The drainage culvert is hard to photograph due to being overgrown in the summer when I visited.

"You may need to be more specific since 76011 might be the most diverse area between Dallas and Ft Worth both in terms of land zoning and ethnic backgrounds. 

It is one of the few spots in Texas where Black, Hispanic, and White people live near each other in equal numbers, though somewhat segregated by neighborhood. 25% of households are considered living in poverty (compared to around 13% for the state). It is not considered especially unsafe, at least compared to the areas south and east of Ft Worth. 

It's a weird zip code because even though it's only 5 miles long and 2-3 miles wide it contains Six Flags in the northeast, Whole Foods, country club golfing, and Crystal Canyon Natural area to the northwest, Main Street in downtown Arlington to the southwest, AT&T Stadium with the other giant sports stadiums and Texas Live! in the center, with I-30 running across.

"Ahh, the legend of Screaming Bridge.  Many mistakenly believe Screaming Bridge to be the old abandoned Trammel Davis Drive bridge that crosses the West Fork Trinity River.  The old Trammel Davis Drive bridge is accessible via the hiking and biking trails in the far western portion of River Legacy Park.

The real site of Screaming Bridge is further to the north and east where the closed part of Greenbelt Road (originally Arlington-Bedford Road) had once crossed the railroad tracks.  

It got the name Screaming Bridge due to a real life accident that happened in 1961 in which 3 high school aged girls died in a single vehicle accident.  You can read about it here: [http://www.theboneyard.org/screaming\_bridge\_arlington\_texas.php](http://www.theboneyard.org/screaming_bridge_arlington_texas.php)
