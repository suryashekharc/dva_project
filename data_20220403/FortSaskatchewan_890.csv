"It seems to me our region has stopped talking about climate change and started moving to do something.

It is a very hopeful sign — very welcome in this time of war and pandemic.

Albertans, and presumably Fort residents too — are less likely than other Canadians to believe climate change is real and an emergency. But even here, twice as many believe this then don't, according to Abacus Data and other recent surveys.

I believe it. I've been watching the science since the 1980s.

And it is an emergency. We have less than a decade to cut carbon emissions or face real disaster.

Serious consequences are already with us. Wildfires and floods are more common than ever. Wildfire smoke is now an annual summer event — and that was never true when I grew up here.

Happily, as I said, local industry has accepted and it moving toward a low carbon future. Dow will be taking advantage of local carbon storage facilities to eliminate carbon emissions at its Fort Saskatchewan site. It will also be investing billions of dollars to expand its facility here.

Shell is also moving to reduce if not eliminate carbon emissions at Scotford. It is also saying this region has a bright future, precisely because industry can expand while moving to a carbon-neutral operation here.

Meanwhile, however, the City of Fort Saskatchewan has a bit of a way to go. Last year City Council threw out a suggestion that electric vehicle charging stations be considered at one or more Fort facilities such as city hall.

Electric vehicles may not be the future. Perhaps hydrogen will prove more efficient. But electric vehicles are way ahead of everything else at the moment. There are already 60 electric vehicle charging stations in the Edmonton region, according to chargehub.com — including six in Sherwood Park.

City Council needs to move with the times.",t2_j4cvc,GlitchedGamer14,0,1648568929.0,0,t1_i2kspmx,i2kspmx,True,GlitchedGamer14,t3_tr51g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/tr51g8/opinion_council_needs_to_join_climate_fight/,Opinion: Council needs to join climate fight,/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/tr51g8/opinion_council_needs_to_join_climate_fight/i2kspmx/,4,r/FortSaskatchewan,0,4
"A compromise has been reached between City of Fort Saskatchewan officials and developers, allowing two new housing projects to go ahead in Fort Saskatchewan this summer.

Two zero lot line proposals will now become extra-narrow lot width projects.

Zero lot line homes have the house built exactly on the property line, while having a 1.5 metre space on the other side of the lot. This reduces the space between homes to just 1.5 metres, rather than the usual 2.8 metre space.

These new projects will instead get a 1.2 metre space on either side of each house, resulting in a 2.4 metre space between homes.

These will be narrower lots than ever before allowed in Fort Saskatchewan, at 8.5 metres wide. The narrowest lot allowed previous to this was 9.1 metres in the RC District. The zero lot line lots would have been 7.6 metre wide.

The two projects will be built in the Forest Ridge area of Westpark, and in the Sienna neighbourhood. Other less controversial housing projects have also been approved in these areas for construction this year.

Fort Saskatchewan allowed a number of zero lot line homes prior to this, but recently objected to further such proposals after running into problems. Among other issues, zero lot line homes require special legal restrictions on each property in order to allow both neighbours access to the space between houses for maintenance.

This restriction has confused homeowners, who have also been building fences where they are not allowed, Fort officials said.

The new extra narrow lot homes will also include various rules to help avoid problems with parking and snow removal found in some previous narrow lot developments in Fort Saskatchewan.

The new proposal is satisfactory to both developers and Fort officials, Qualico Communities representative Chris Davis said Tuesday. ""This design is the result of a successful collaborative discussion by both parties.""

Mayor Gale Katchur also said she was pleased to see a compromise reached.

Both projects are expected to be built this year. A significant result will be the completion of Westpark Drive, taking traffic pressure off Woodbridge Link.",t2_j4cvc,GlitchedGamer14,0,1648568904.0,0,t1_i2ksncq,i2ksncq,True,GlitchedGamer14,t3_tr5160,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/tr5160/zero_lot_line_compromise_reached/,Zero lot line compromise reached,/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/tr5160/zero_lot_line_compromise_reached/i2ksncq/,2,r/FortSaskatchewan,0,2
"The need for a local homeless shelter came up at Fort Saskatchewan's policing town hall last week.

RCMP work with other agencies, such as Families First, to help, but often have to take the homeless to shelters in Edmonton, Staff Sgt. Ternell St. Pierre said at the online meeting Wednesday, March 16.

Many people don't want to go to a shelter, but more help is needed for local homeless people, he said.

A group is apparently looking to create a local shelter and bridge support for the homeless. RCMP officials said they would be interested in speaking with that group.

Wednesday's town hall meeting also discussed local crime rates and new services now offered at the Fort Saskatchewan detachment, such as the domestic violence unit City Council agreed to fund starting last year.

Other local fundraisers for Ukraine have succeeded in raising thousands of dollars. Twice But Nice raised $2,073.10 at its Raising Hope fundraiser. All purchases made at the store on March 12 went to the Canadian Red Cross Humanitarian Relief Fund.

Fort Lanes raised at least $1,500 for the Red Cross at its special bowling tournament on March 13. A Grade 3 class at Win Ferguson school also raised over $2,500 at their bottle drive for the Red Cross on March 10.

"The best protests are made with your wallet.

The next best protests are made by contacting your local representatives and talking with them.

Blocking traffic and blazing horns is just going to antagonize your cause, I don't care what it is. 

I remember when I lived in Vancouver a protest blocked my way to work for 30 minutes on burrard street, one of the busiest streets there. I was reprimanded for it and all I remember of that protest is that I was pissed at them for making me late. Their cause was secondary to my inconvenience. 

At the same time, I get that these people want to be heard and seen and show they aren't just some Twitter Fringe. I just think there's better ways to do it, I just don't know what it is. The economy is already balls to the walls in crippling debt and this seems to just be furthering that. So were these mandates, so maybe they have a point.

It just seems contradictory to be protesting something bad for the economy by doing something bad for the economy. It's petty.

Also, Covid is kinda just a thing a large number of countries seem to accept as the yearly flu. I've got friends in Norway and Sweden that say they've pretty much agreed to just accept it and move on. We got like 90% of the population vaccinated and cases are exploding so it's not like they did all that much.

Follow the money. Politicians are making money from the vaccines, so they'll do what they need to do to keep pushing for vaccines. It's not a unique situation to covid, in Canada they just have to be more coy about it because we don't allow lobbyists. In the United States stuff like this is Tuesday. 

As for editorials, they're glorified blogs that have the label of a news company and are often paraded as news.

">Since when did local news need to start injecting it's opinions into things? If I wanted an opinion, I'd go on Fort Sask informed, lol.

To be fair, editorials and columns are a pretty standard feature of newspapers lol

I have nothing against protests, but I honestly think the one in Ottawa is beyond that point. A protest is intended to make voices heard, as you said. But here, the organizers and core protestors are saying that they won't stop occupying streets and making noise (at least during part of the day) until all levels of governments remove their covid restrictions (Canada Unity mentioned municipal and provincial governments, as well as the feds, in their MOU). At that point, it stops being a protest, and it stops being democratic. 

I believe that it sets a very dangerous precedent if groups can block parts of cities, or important infrastructure like the highway at Coutts, until they force democratically elected governments to change policies. They made themselves heard last week, and I think it should have ended that same weekend. If they really want to keep going, then make it a weekly thing like what seems to be happening in Edmonton. But don't stop the city from functioning during the week, or prevent people from going about their lives until you get everything you want ('you' being the participants, not you specifically). 

There's a difference between trying to convince people that change is necessary, and trying to strong-arm governments into doing what you want them to regardless of what the majority of Canadians want. This doesn't mean that I want them censored, and I don't believe that they have been censored. There are plenty of groups on Facebook that support them. There are livestreams on YouTube that have been showing ""inside"" the convoy since the first day it arrived in Ottawa. We've seen major Conservative politicians speaking in favour of them, including our own Garnett Genuis. There might not be mainstream news organizations publishing columns in support of them, but that does not equal censorship; it just means that editorial decisions were made not to publish content in support of them. And that's perfectly democratic; we shouldn't force news publications to put out certain content. Didn't the Western Standard Online publish content supporting them? They're not being shut down because of that. 

I also don't want us to allow any groups or people to ""negotiate"" that ""we'll leave your downtown/highway *if* you enact/remove 'X' policy in return"". Our public infrastructure shouldn't be used as bargaining chips - no matter the context.",t2_j4cvc,GlitchedGamer14,0,1644263785.0,0,t1_hvzi5ga,hvzi5ga,False,GlitchedGamer14,t3_skkt81,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/skkt81/column_freedom_convoy_far_more_problematic_than/,"COLUMN: ""Freedom"" convoy far more problematic than effective | Fort Saskatchewan Record",/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/skkt81/column_freedom_convoy_far_more_problematic_than/hvzi5ga/,1,r/FortSaskatchewan,0,1

To quote Democrat AOC, the whole point of protests is to make people uncomfortable to provoke change. 

Like it or not, That's the power of the people and how democracy works, especially if you believe your elected representatives are no longer representing you. You need to let them know. 

I ain't fully on their side, but I see nothing different than the people blocking trains or highways for any other reason. Just because you don't like what theyre saying doesn't give you the right to shut them up. 

That's their right and the fact people and media are working so hard to shut them up maybe means they have a point when it comes to freedom of speech and censorship.

Historically, censorship has never been on the right side of history and by trying to stop them, you're maybe just proving their point.

Ignore them and they'll go away.

"The Fort was much larger in 1894 than when it was first constructed in 1875. It was made the headquarters of the North-West Mounted Police's (NWMP) 'G' Division in 1885, and it was expanded accordingly. The palisade wall surrounding the fort was taken down in 1886, and the fort was expanded again in 1889. 

As headquarters of 'G' division, the fort hosted patrols that went as far as Fort Simpson and Chesterfield Inlet - both in the Northwest Territories. The fort was in use until 1911, when it was transferred from the NWMP to the province of Alberta, who soon demolished it to build a gaol (prison). Some artifacts have been found since, including clothing buttons and remnants of the original palisade wall!

">Unfortunately, it appears that the developers of the Draft Curriculum did not consider the data available to them about what students can and cannot accomplish by certain grade levels. Some of our teachers have been involved in provincial working groups who develop Provincial Achievement Tests. They have been involved in setting standards for what a Grade 6 student can achieve. The province‘s apparent dismissal of data they had at hand is telling. Nevertheless, PHSD will consider opportunities to provide feedback to the Ministry of Education in other ways, but we will not ask our teachers to pilot the Draft Curriculum.",t2_5lvkxmxj,AlternativeLow5,0,1619804712.0,0,t1_gwg7zcb,gwg7zcb,True,AlternativeLow5,t3_n1yplt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/n1yplt/to_find_out_why_parents_teachers_and_experts_are/,"To find out why parents, teachers, and experts are speaking out about the UCP draft curriculum, read the Pembina Hills School Division's reasons why they will not pilot it",/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/n1yplt/to_find_out_why_parents_teachers_and_experts_are/gwg7zcb/,3,r/FortSaskatchewan,0,3

The plague is actually studied in depth in the social 8 program of studies, at an age where they will be able to retain more of what they learn and be able to apply critical thinking regarding differing world views and examine and evaluate the plague insofar as it affects how people and their perspectives.

"She was in grade 2.  Some Kids are still 6 years old. 

Sure She was empathetic but she was mostly terrified.   There’s a major difference    She asked if the “government will take her away”!  She was not grasping that residential schools hurt indigenous culture only that the government is evil.   


It was clear to me and her mother that she was taught that ALL white  people are inherently bad because of the existence of residential schools.   I have a problem with this.  

She asked if she was a bad person because of residential schools.  I have a problem with this.   

She isn’t being simply taught about its existence.  She’s being indoctrinated to feel guilty about something that’s not her fault and began before her great grandparents were born.  And when some kids are still 6 years old it’s difficult for them to comprehend.  

I want them to learn about ALL history.  

As for Genghis Khan, what is the context of what they are learning?   He’s instrumental in world history.   What are the details?   
Will our children be taught that it was their fault what he did?  Not likely!  
Or will they be taught about the areas he covered?  That the great wall of China is a function of him living?  Will they be taught that approximately 1 in 6 People are related to him?    
Do we see the difference?   
Perhaps residential schools can be taught to 6 and 7 years old but the kids shouldn’t walk away with the feeling of being upset, guilty or ashamed for it.  This is wrong!

I learnt about bubonic plague when I was at least in grade 4.  But they didn’t talk about the pain from the boyles the victims had.  We learnt that it existed, how it spread, and what it did to population and that is unlikely something like this would happen again thanks to modern medicine.   The context of what is being taught is the difference.  The song ring around the Rosies is based on the plague.

">Again, I want them to be taught about all this history.  But when she hasn’t turned 7 yet it’s a lot to understand.   She still thinks Santa is real.   

I think that's still an issue with the draft curriculum to be honest. I agree the current one needs a re-work, as have most experts when talking about this. When the NDPs were drafting a new curriculum, hundreds of teachers were involved in the process. So there's definitely a recognition that this needs to happen.

The issue is that the UCPs ignored expert feedback and based this curriculum around the idea that kids need to learn certain bodies of knowledge in a certain order – a practice which is considered to be outdated and ineffective. 

This is the outline provided by [Global News.](https://globalnews.ca/news/7729806/alberta-school-curriculum-social-studies-criticism/) I don't know your daughter's abilities, but this seems  like a lot for most kids.

"Personally, I was happy with Gale and Gordon. They've been big supporters of regional cooperation, investment in community services, and generally progressive policies. Gordon is our rep on the [regional transit services commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Metropolitan_Transit_Services_Commission) board, and he's been involved with regional transit initiatives (as a member of council) for decades. But I see where you're coming from for sure; Lennox and Kelly were so frustrating to listen to over the years.

Here's a fun (and frustrating) fact: Council actually voted for Fort Sask Transit to get an electric bus. It needed a third bus anyways, and the previous NDP government wanted to give us a partial  grant for an electric one. So why didn't we get it? Because the UCP cancelled the Alberta Community Transit Fund, which covered the province's portion of the bill, and council didn't want to get stuck with a bill that suddenly jumped from $70,000 to $397,000. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Sask_Transit#History)

"Those are both things that no politician in the right mind would vote against these days. Career killers in the public eye. 

And having no personal investment in a subject matter makes it easier to vote for it. Not their budget, not their rules.

My point is, our councilors have actively turned down opportunities to progress beyond the minimum expectation. Conversion therapy is going federal, as you said. What a wonderful chance for them to make a few headlines while not actually accomplishing any break throughs. 

They could've done it 3 years ago, but instead they wait for an election year and until the federal government makes such a thing inevitable.

I have had poor interactions with our councilors and do not believe they have the interest of the city at heart. If you disagree, I can respect that opinion. As a city employee I have seen how things are run, and the budget cuts seem to only apply to things that effect the end-user (aka: the citizens of Fort Sask) while internal spending runs rampant.

"100% agree.

Brian Kelly, current councilor, is definitely the one I have butt heads with the most on this.

When bringing up electric vehicle incentives or even just having charging ports installed at public buildings, Brian simply denied the science, saying electric vehicles are worse for the environment. 

While he had some legitimate points about the extraction of battery material, he failed to recognize the tech, still being in its wide-spread infancy, is still more environmentally friendly than even the best ICE. It's the lack of government initiative that is keeping progress on these vehicles so low. Chicken and egg. If the government doesn't put the infrastructure in place, of course fewer people are going to use it.

He also failed to comment on the federal governments plans to meet 30% adaption of electric vehicles by 2030. He pretty much only commented on me calling our current lack of policy ""short sighted"" and cried about that.

Gale Katchur was surprisingly open to the idea but she's at the end of her term. I would say yes to anything if I knew I'd never have to live up to the promise, lol. Not to judge her character, but the words don't mean much at this time.

Deanna Lennox gave a non-answer, pretty much saying she would have to gauge people's reactions. To me, that's pretty much her saying ""I'll do whatever keeps me in office.""

As for other environmental concerns, city council has struck down numerous requests to aquire for efficient equipment vehicles in the city.

With Fort Saskatchewan having an insanely high asthma rate compared to the national average, the environment, smog and air quality should be a top priority. Instead not one of them cares.

I put a bit of onus on those type of people that are more ignorant in Fort Saskatchewan, making it difficult to run (successfully) for politics with more environmentally conscious planning. 

I'm asking, because I've seen the inefficiencies of this local government first hand and am considering running simply out of desire to not have an unopposed mayor or a bunch of bigoted council members again who push everyone's pennies but their own.

 I don't know how much of a chance I would stand, but I figure if I could rally the younger vote I'd have a chance, as I am only 26 years old.

"It’s to encourage people to actually put in the effort to recycle and compost. 

“The City of Fort Saskatchewan has chosen biweekly garbage collection to encourage residents to reduce their waste. Compared with having weekly collection of both organics and garbage, biweekly garbage collection decreases costs substantially and increases the likelihood that residents will divert their organic material.

In most cases, families who place their food and yard waste in their green cart and who recycle using their blue bags will have very little garbage in their black cart. Check out our sorting guide to see if there is anything else you could be placing in your green cart or blue bag.

If you are still having difficulty with biweekly collection, please call the Waste Hotline at 780.992.6218 and we will work to help you.”",t2_3wqdz0gs,manohtree,0,1615687888.0,0,t1_gquyk3s,gquyk3s,False,AlternativeLow5,t3_m4fy89,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/m4fy89/those_of_you_angry_about_cancel_culture_should/,"Those of you angry about ""cancel culture"" should obviously be furious that our tax dollars are going toward trying to get Netflix to cancel a show because of its underlying message.",/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/m4fy89/those_of_you_angry_about_cancel_culture_should/gquyk3s/,1,r/FortSaskatchewan,0,1

"Welcome to the city :)

You should start with the [River Valley Trails](https://www.fortsask.ca/en/things-to-do/river-valley.aspx#). There's 19 km of them total, split between a few different routes. The page I linked has a PDF map you can download.

Of those routes, I'd say the West River's Edge loop is one of the most beautiful we have, and it's very long.

The Historical Precinct loop is small, but it contains a lot of neat parts of our history, like the site of the original fort and the replica fort beside it, the Warden's House (part of the old jail site), the old court house, a historic village you can walk through, and [a platform](https://ibb.co/5xGnw0T) which describes our history in pretty good detail. So, if you want to learn more about Fort Sask, the Historic Precinct loop is a great area to check out. Just make sure that you also explore the [area that I highlighted](https://ibb.co/tXZ9sVS).

"""Yes we're open. We are still doing maintenance on the rinks daily, starting at Mowat and moving to RCMP around 11ish. We remove any snow, sweep the rinks of debris, and then flood them, all on a daily basis.

Please keep in mind that while the rinks are open 6am to 11pm, we still have to maintain and inspect them on a daily basis and can't have people using them while we do so, according to our workplace safe work practices.  In order for them to remain open, they need to be cleared of snow, swept of debris, and flooded which can take up to 3 hours. Maybe more if we get a lot of snow.

"I... would disagree with the idea on this one.   Where exactly are you going to put it that it would be worthwhile for anyone in either community?   

We still have enough distance between us that even if put at the half way mark on Hwy 21, it would be faster to roll a fire engine from the existing hall to the south side of town that it would be to roll one north to Fort Sask.

"That's why I support the Regional Transit Services Commission. Rather than footing the bill for creating an entire transit service from scratch, we'd just have to pay a membership fee.

"Prior to COVID, I was a huge supporter of the bus service. I relied on it daily to commute to work. This all stopped the day they switched from the big busses to smaller ones, coincidentally on the very first day that university students we back in classes. The busses we packed to standing room only, and I witnessed several times where people were not allowed to get on because there was no room. If you think that having people stand on a bus traveling 100 KM/hr on Manning freeway is not safe, you would be correct. 

I took this discussion to the transit manager (Mr. Diongi) and to a couple of councilors and it got nowhere. Mr. Diongi claimed that people loved the smaller buses and the City had no safety concerns, as it was not liable if there was an accident and the standing people were hurt because they chose to get on a crowded bus knowing there were no seats. Mr. Diongi further claimed that the City needed to save money and he wanted to have later running schedules in the morning, so that would solve the ridership issue. I cannot prove this, but I think Mr. Diongi artificially created the cramped bus conditions to justify the later schedules. 

Now you may be asking, did the new schedules make things better for the cramped buses? Turns out, even if you make later schedules, people still need to get to class and work on time early in the morning. Even before COVID, those later schedules ran mostly empty. 

Councillor Kelly is right. At $100 per commuter, the city would save money hiring taxis for everyone instead.

"As an opinion piece, I can respect Dave's position. That said, I do disagree with a number of his points.

1. Aquatics Program - Harbour Pool is tiny, out of the way, and lacking many amenities that most cities our size have in their aquatic centers.  Putting a pool in DCC makes a ton of sense - We're already trying to make DCC the focal point of the community for activities.  Harbour Pool couldn't be upgraded to meet any kind of amenity standard without being closed for years for renovation/rebuild, not counting the lack of space on that site to expand.
2. Why wouldn't we upgrade Dow?  We're a growing city of almost 30,000 people. Upgrades to our ""crown jewel"" of community amenities makes a ton of sense.
3. New firehall for Southfort.  He does realize that rolling a firetruck _to_ the south side of the city takes a hell of a lot longer than rolling a truck _from_ the south side would take, right?  Firefighters are often also 1st responders and seconds mean everything in an emergency.  Factor in the ""traffic"" on Veterans Way/Hwy 15/21, and the growth areas over the next couple years being 100% south of the city (including the new annexed lands from Strathcona County) and you have a logistical nightmare you can't afford. 
4. Why would we spend good money after bad rebuilding the Jubilee Rec Center if they're trying to position DCC as _the_ rec center?  We don't really need 2 in a city this size.
5. I can agree with the History Centre, but I don't think it'll get nearly as much use as Dave thinks it will.",t2_3z4aw,chazmosis,0,1603139645.0,0,t1_g9d5ief,g9d5ief,True,GlitchedGamer14,t3_je5y86,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/je5y86/truscott_10_year_capital_plan_is_a_mess/,Truscott: 10 year capital plan is a mess,/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/je5y86/truscott_10_year_capital_plan_is_a_mess/g9d5ief/,2,r/FortSaskatchewan,0,2
"In [this picture](https://i.redd.it/nqx3kfg8fnf51.jpg) from 1980, originally posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/i5mkml/fort_saskatchewan_seen_from_the_air_october_24th/?sort=top), you can see the bridge to the left of the railway bridge. You can also see thr prison cemetary, which was relocated to make way for the new road bridge going across the river, which opened in 1957. At that time, it connected the two sides of the gaol's farm, which was operated by the inmates. According to local residents who responded to the photo, it supplied, among other things, potatoes for Alberta's prison system, and vegetables that were donated to the Christmas Hamper every year.

Also, here's a neat fact about the prison cemetary: We don't currently know who is buried there. The cemetary holds some of the 29 prisoners who were executed there between 1914-1960. However, the bodies of other executed prisoners were claimed by their families, and at least one was donated to medical research. As well, the cemetary also holds prisoners who died of natural, or other causes other than hanging. When the cemetary was relocated for the new bridge project, the records of who was buried in what plot were lost, and so their names have been lost to history.",t2_j4cvc,GlitchedGamer14,0,1603136830.0,0,t1_g9czemq,g9czemq,True,GlitchedGamer14,t3_je8y3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/je8y3c/old_gaol_bridge_closed_for_maintenance/,Old gaol bridge closed for maintenance,/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/je8y3c/old_gaol_bridge_closed_for_maintenance/g9czemq/,2,r/FortSaskatchewan,0,2

"Great, thanks for replying! I am happy to help....I travel for work all the time and need washrooms. Since Covid, there are fewer options for the public and businesses don't seem to care about the dilemma that creates. 

Grocery stores all have washrooms available for the public to use. No one is checking to see if you bought something. The older the place, the more likely they are to be at the back. 

Hotels also have several lobby-level washrooms, especially if there is a conference centre there. These are not public also, but generally no one cares much about you walking in.

"We haven't been ""flooded with millions of immigrants"". We take in a few hundred thousand each year, mainly because our birth rate is too low to sustain our current population. Unless you want a situation like Japan's, where they have more retired people taking benefits than they have people paying for those benefits, we need immigrants. 

Second, our economic immigration requirements are super stringent. Most people need to get a certain number of ""points"" to qualify, and so unless they have a masters or PhD, they're super experienced in their fields, and they have a great grasp of English, they aren't likely to make it here unless it's for humanitarian reasons, they already have immediate family here, or they're sponsored by a company.

Thirdly, if you're upset that some jobs are filled with temporary foreign workers, I have two reasons for you: People born in Canada aren't willing to work in those fields (like seasonal farm work, for instance), or the companies would rather game the system than pay more for Canadian workers. Either way, it's not the immigrants' fault, and fear mongering with hyperboles does nothing to help your situation.",t2_j4cvc,GlitchedGamer14,0,1602032188.0,0,t1_g7ygjaw,g7ygjaw,False,GlitchedGamer14,t3_j6az8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/j6az8j/three_new_benefits_announced_to_help_canadians/,Three new benefits announced to help Canadians dealing with COVID-19,/r/FortSaskatchewan/comments/j6az8j/three_new_benefits_announced_to_help_canadians/g7ygjaw/,1,r/FortSaskatchewan,0,1

I must say, the campground downtown is the worst lions campground I've ever seen. And u wouldnt say that the benchmark for lions campgrounds is overwhelmingly high. Ours basically a parking lot for workers. You cant even have a fire at your site. The staff are rude. We had family stay there this summer and I was not impressed. The amenities nearby are great, but the campground itself is an embarrassment .

If by expand they intended to start over with the current site, then so be it, but from the limited things I've read that's not really the angle here.
