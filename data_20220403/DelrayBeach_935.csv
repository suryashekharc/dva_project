"Ya I hear ya, I'd prefer East Delray near Atlantic as it's more happening, but East Boca near Mizner would be cool too. Walking distance to beach and restaurants/bars/shops is the goal but I am also hoping for something on a canal to dock my boat which makes things much harder.

I have stayed pretty much everywhere from Jupiter down to the Keys and Delray is my favorite. Deerfield is the next town south of Boca and it's not bad either but not a big strip and pretty much dead by 7PM. The beach is really nice though.

"Ok so I love Latin food and I've lived up and down from Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach. The truth is that the Boca Raton / Delray Beach area has the *least* good Latin food in the area. Just north in Lake Worth and just south in Pompano you will find much better Latin food.

Here's a few suggestions for Mexican food.

**Las Fajitas** \- If you're looking for a delicious nearby hole-in-the-wall restaurant, get the carne asada platter or fajitas at **Las Fajitas** on old Dixie in Boca Raton. Be sure to wash that all down with some Margaritas.

**El Rey Del Taco -** Moving a little farther away from Delray, if you want street tacos, check out  in Lake Worth. This place is so authentic that if you are white the Spanish speaking people running the food truck will be slightly surprised will be confused you're not at the more gringo **Tacos Al Carbon** in the same parking lot area. (Tacos al Carbon is also so good that it's worth a try!) El Rey Del Taco also has a nice sit-down restaurant nearby that has a live classic Mexican signing vocalist performing. Super authentic. 

Honorable mentions:

**La Lupe** in Pompano.

**Bien Chido** tacos in Plantation. These are the best tacos al pastor I've found in all of Florida, but its a good 45 mins away from Delray beach.",t2_6wp5b,njchava,0,1638593566.0,0,t1_hn5s5w2,hn5s5w2,True,madbear84,t3_r88q6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delraybeach/comments/r88q6h/ill_be_visiting_your_city_this_coming_february/,"I’ll be visiting your city this coming February, and I’m wondering, what are some of the best and most authentic latin restaurants in the area?",/r/Delraybeach/comments/r88q6h/ill_be_visiting_your_city_this_coming_february/hn5s5w2/,5,r/Delraybeach,0,5

"Hi! I just moved to Delray Beach last July with my girlfriend. House prices are getting pretty crazy, but I think you can still get something nice for $1M or less. All the action/fun seems to be east of I95. The Lake Idea area is a very nice neighborhod, but a little far to walk to Atlantic Ave or the beach. I love the Historic Area SE - east of Federal (6th ave) and South of Atlantic. There are a lot of townhouse areas that seem nice too - like Pineapple Grove. Pricey though. 

If you want to be more adventurous, you could find cheaper/fixer-upper houses in the NW and SW closer to I95 (like 3rd Ave and greater) but those neighborhoods are more a mix of nicely renovated houses and really old/ugly not-yet renovated stuff.

There's a big development going in over the next year on first block SW of Swinton and Atlantic (Sundy Village). That should make the SW corner, closest to downtown shape up some over the next few years.

"If you aren't way, way, WAY East you will be in slummy neighborhoods for most of South Florida.  Either be ON the beach, or be a few miles west (about 6+ miles).  You want to be west of Jog road in Delray; that's where all the newer housing is with best schools, family neighborhoods, and gated HOA communities.  The area between Jog to Congress (the middle) does not have good schools and some older, run down neighborhoods. Not the place you are looking for with a 1MM budget.

For Delray with a 1MM budget you should consider neighborhoods off Lyons road where all the new major development is happening. Just adjacent to the turnpike. That will also line you up with the various Canyons neighborhoods in west Boynton Beach along Lyons road.  I'd target the area between Atlantic Blvd and Boynton Beach Blvd and between Hagen Ranch (though mostly 55+ on HR Rd) and 441 overall, with Lyons rd in particular.

"Delray is cool although there’s been a real influx of folks coming from all over recently. The area is becoming very top-heavy again with retirees from New York New Jersey and Westchester and it’s pushing prices through the stratosphere. Everybody drives a Benz, but everybody also lives in a tiny townhome going for half a million.  While there are younger people here, I get the impression that they are somewhat being pushed out by the older & wealthier retirees except for a smaller higher earning group, which you may be in.   One thing is for sure – you won’t stay single for long. The expression is Florida is a very hard place to stay single in; it’s also a very hard place to stay married in.

I'd like to buy him a new one for his birthday coming up, but can't find it anywhere online. I called Epic and they weren't able to give me any info on it over the phone. I am wondering if it's a local brand?

Anyways, if you know what brand this hat is, or have spotted it in stores I would be immensely grateful.

"Greetings,

So I moved to delray in the summer of last year from Pennsylvania. Its my girlfriend, myself, and a 100lb pitbull. I couldn't find any apartment to rent to us. Luckily, I came across a subdivided house (via zillow) with a nice fenced in yard 1 mile from the beach, half mile from Atlantic ave. I pay 1700$ a month and have 2 bedrooms, and that includes utilities and internet.

My advice for you (if possible), drive up and down the streets near where you are looking. I see a lot of sub divided houses in my area that will post for rent signs in the yard but not online. I would check behind the chocolate factory.

"Your budget will be important since it can be pricey. With your age, you will probably enjoy living east of Military more because it's closer to downtown Delray. Not sure where you are moving from, but Florida is interesting because it's kinda mixture of 'bad' and good neighborhood in a small block.   


I would recommend The Franklin ... fairly new community and I know a few of my old co-workers that lived there before. It's close to all of the supermarkets like Trader Joes, Whole Foods, Publix, and other plazas.   


Axis is okay (by Linton and Congress) but I did hear some funky stories from different people.   


Verano (Linton and in between Congress + Military) is not bad either. I would choose that one before Axis.   


If your budget is higher, I can definitely recommend a few more.

"Did this search for months. Wanted to spend $1200 max but it’s just not possible unless you  literally want a closet space or something that feels like the floors may fall through.

One thing I really miss from where I previously lived is the 'hole  in the wall' places. Where you get great food for great prices.

"His name is Trudy. Don’t know his backstory, but I’ve made nice with him over the past few years. He never begs and I often see him writing on brown paper bags.
