"You should get your well water professionally tested. PH will give you no indication of the quality of the water or the presence of contaminants.

Iron in water would be more orange/red than it would be brown. For all we know, the brown color could be from organic matter from the dump site. If you leave a glass of water sitting for a while, does the brown color settle or does it stay suspended in the water?

"I’ve lived near Ben Lomond Park (now Splashdown?), Georgetown South, Lake Jackson, and in that old neighborhood behind Manaport Plaza off of Lomond Dr.

I like Manassas, and I’m defensive of it, too.

Many of the issues you describe were already present 50 years ago.  In 1977, property taxes got too high, so we moved to the Shenandoah Valley.

The inexorable spread of gentrification, though, is an interesting point.  It seems that the era of shopping malls may be ending.  People seem to be drawn back to the old downtown feel (eg Reston Town Center, Fairfax Corner, the resurrection of Springfield Mall).

This trend really pleases me, personally.  I loved standing on the curb in downtown Manassas for the Christmas parade when I was a small child in 1968.

For a while it looked like all of our little towns were doomed.  Now, it looks like those yuppies you decry might be helping to resuscitate our downtowns.

And I’m not sure I would blame the tax increases on that.  (To be fair, I haven’t done any research on the matter, though.)

Not natives or those that truly love the old Manassas rural community that it USED to be before the DC yuppies moved in and caused property taxes and apartment rents to rise. The current iteration of Manassas is what Fairfax  USED to be and what Warrenton is destined to become.

It started way back when like this I imagine, DC *was* nice, DC got a criminal element, folks moved from DC to escape the criminal element to Arlington which *used* to be nice, until the DC criminals followed the movement of folks from DC to the NOVA suburbs. It never filters up, always filters down, DC to Arlington to Fairfax to Manassas  to Warrenton to Culpeper, etc. et al.

"Welcome! I moved here a year ago from DC and really enjoy it :)

Manassas is very quiet and suburban with close access to  some great camping, hiking, and running trails. It’s 1.5 hours from Shenandoah which is a bit far but still close enough for a nice weekend away. Old Town Manassas is a cute downtown area and the bars get pretty lively at night. We are also 1 hour from Harpers Ferry, another attractive historic town with lots to do. Concert venues are opening up for the first time since Covid - Manassas is close to the Jiffy Lube Live amphitheater. There are tons of wineries/breweries/distilleries -  check out the steins vines and shines trail. If you like shopping the Fair Oaks mall is nice but Manassas is also 40 mins away from the largest mall in VA called the Potomac Mills Mall.

"1.	 I lived in Manassas for over 3 years (moved 10 minutes away, but still frequent town). I personally see old town Manassas as a great spot. Crossroads Tabletop Tavern is located there and is always packed. 
2.	I think a retro video game store would be viable, but location will definitely be the key factor. Again, I personally believe that Old Town is preferable, but I also don’t own a business hah. 
3.	High traffic area would be anywhere on Sudley Road, although foot traffic would be almost non-existent (unless you’re in a shopping center/strip mall).
4.	I have not purchased any retro games from McKays, but I’ve seen a gold NES Legend of Zelda SNES cartridge in mint condition for $80. I’ve also seen Gameboy games/NES/SNES/Genesis/PS1/PS2/PS3/ range from $10-$50.

"As far as apartments in Manassas, there are tons. I've lived in alot of them, lol. It's probably easier to tell you which ones to don't even waste time on...RUN AWAY from anything in Westgate, Coverstone, Iron Gate, Price Cole, and George Town South. All areas where I would not want my wife or daughter walking from car to house alone at night. There are alot of newer apartments in Manassas Park. Orchard Glen is pretty cheap, older, but looks really nice on the outside. They look like townhouses, but also have apartments. Or if you want to be closer to work, but skip some of the manassas traffic, you might try Orchard Bridge, just off 28. I believe they where somewhat reasonable in price. If you check out Sterling, any of the apartments around Dullestown Center are nice, or along Frying Pan. But all more pricey.

I'll chime in. Battery heights is a pretty great spot. Full of apartments and condos. I have a few friends there and it seems like a safe well kept place. Also having walmart and several other shopping spots near by is convenient. Not to mention you have some great restaurants. If you like Italian I highly suggest Bella vita.

Manassas Park built a ""city center"" a few years ago that is mostly empty because they overpriced the rent.  They've become more reasonable as rent everywhere else as gone up, and they are quite nice inside (we took a few tours on  a humbug, just to check them out.)

"Manassas is basically your ordinary suburb, with a growing hispanic presence.  Stay away from the communities of Georgetown South, Coverstone, Irongate as those are higher crime areas.  But then again where ever you are, lock doors and cars and you'll be fine.  We do all the things small towns do.  Don't miss the Xmas parade in December if it's not covid cancelled!

There is also a high amount of Fed government influence.   No surprise right?  Like if the fed government has a day off, and you dont... double check your day care is still open.   Yes my kid was the only kid so the daycare planned on closing to my surprise!

The area is changing to democrats and the usual shenanigans that involves.  For example,  schools named for Stonewall Jackson were recently renamed.  Also, attempts at being more of an immigrant sanctuary town are common.  Taxes are going up, and county board members keep approving new residential zones when there is much more need for office/comercial/industrial zones.",t2_saw6u1u,nealbscott,0,1613525196.0,0,t1_gnpqjy3,gnpqjy3,True,4nin9r,t3_ll8vks,https://www.reddit.com/r/manassas/comments/ll8vks/moving_to_manassas/,Moving to Manassas,/r/manassas/comments/ll8vks/moving_to_manassas/gnpqjy3/,-6,r/manassas,0,-6
"In the local mall we have a knock off Dave and Buster's/Bowling alley/Sports bar Called Uptown Alley. Right next to it is a Go-Karting place: Autobahn. Not sure if their open with Covid still being a problem.

Night live is pretty much nonexistent atm. Their are a few bars in Olde Towne that are still operating also a few interesting shops in the same place, candles, wood carvings, custom ceramics and more.

 If you want local coffee their is Jarani's coffee shop and Central Grounds Station down the street. (Both also in Olde Towne) Go to CCS for better drinks, Jarani's for better atmosphere. 

Would also recommend Crossroads table top tavern, (Also in Olde Towne) a good little sit down with a full library of board games that you can play while your there. 

Not sure if your into smoking and hookah, but there are a few cafes in the city as well. 

Best Ruben in the city is at Gunston Deli off of enterprise CT closer to Manassas Park. A hole in the wall cafe that you will never find if you don't know that it exists.

I suffer from depression. Can’t get out of bed physically give up at times depression. 

If you find one friend, a true friend. You can consider yourself blessed. 

You love art and you’re good at it, but it isn’t paying the bills. The hard truth is, no ones going to help you. You have to do it. Choose to move forward. And you know what? You can.

Look at everything you’ve managed to survive. You can survive a job doing something you don’t like, and maybe it’ll lead to another opportunity. So on and so forth. Nobody has to like you, ever. But everyone should respect you. Start from there.

Make a choice to get a different job and aim small miss small. Take some bigger chances after you can begin to piece yourself together and figure out what you really need to be happy.

"Manassas had a bad reputation for years, based mainly on the perception that it was full of low intelligence people... aka Manassholes. That has not been my experience lately tho. I started working there a few years ago, and Old Town is charming... great restaurants and small businesses. And they do this really cool first Friday thing where they shut down parts of side streets in old town, and it becomes almost like a street fair, with live music, you can mingle out in the street with drinks from the local restaurants, it’s really a good time and manages to be fun for adults and still have a family friendly vibe.

It has several strip malls and chain restaurants on Liberia Ave as well as on Sudley Rd, which is an eyesore but you don’t have to drive far to find Old Navy or Noodles and Co and the like. 

I don’t live there but there is a diversity of neighborhoods and housing, including some upscale neighborhoods.

The police department is professional and quick responding overall, and there is a hospital in the city and another a few miles up the road in Haymarket. I don’t know about the schools. 

It’s pretty centrally located. Within an hour tops you can be in DC, you can be in the mountains hiking, you can be out in the Fauquier countryside with their wineries and breweries, you can be in Fairfax for a mall with dept stores and more upscale shops in Fairfax.",t2_160bv2,SoOverYouAll,0,1591173104.0,0,t1_fsq7lqj,fsq7lqj,True,[deleted],t3_gvan3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/manassas/comments/gvan3j/potentially_relocating_to_manassas/,Potentially Relocating to Manassas,/r/manassas/comments/gvan3j/potentially_relocating_to_manassas/fsq7lqj/,2,r/manassas,0,2

"Manassas is a great place to live I think. I have lived here a pretty long time I guess so please message me if you have any questions. Manassas gets a lot of hate for no reason in my opinion.

Yes some places in Manassas have more crime than others, but I don’t think it’s any worse than other similar cities.

"Tortino Mare Restaurant is pretty good Italian food in Manassas

Ciao Osteria in Centreville is a hit or miss but when it's good, it is good. another Italian place. 

Bowling at the mall (wonder if they have glow bowling)

also at the mall is AutoBahn (go-karts) - next to bowling place. i haven't tried it but it looked cool. they were going fast! https://autobahnspeed.com/

Drum & bass at Epicure Cafe Saturdays 1-2x/month in Fairfax, about 30 min from Manassas. pretty sure it's 18+ but double check. https://www.facebook.com/METROPOLIS.DnB/

Philadelphia Tavern in Old Town has karaoke/live music on Fri/Sat i think. not sure if it's 18+ though.

Laser tag - don't have a specific place to recommend but I've seen a sign for it somewhere in Manassas

check out the Hylton Performing Arts Center's schedule for performances & ask about student discounts if that applies to you. https://hyltoncenter.org/

hiking in Bull Run Regional Park or Manassas National Battlefield Park

if you can, I'd suggest going out to DC. that'll be your best bet finding 18+ clubs/music venues. driving there & finding parking isn't too bad during the weekend / after work hours. use the SpotHero/Parkopedia apps if you want to find a parking garage.

"Nowhere to necessarily avoid really.

Manassas’ “ghettos” are just working class black/Hispanic people. I don’t think there’s much to worry about honestly. 

Apartments close to Old Town will give you the ability to have a fun nightlife and yes, there is a lively live music scene, especially around Philly Tavern but a lot of the restaurants host live music every week.

And Jirani’s Coffeehouse has lots of stuff going on too.

Welcome! It’s a really great little city that has so so much to offer!

Manassas has Parks, Prince William County has Parks, the Manassas National Battlefield is great. Another good one is Bristow Battlefield Park. Doves Landing is great. 

And don’t be afraid of the strip malls on Sudley. Obviously they are super ugly but they have some of the best Salvadoran/Guatemalan/Peruvian restaurants in the whole city in them. 

Our food scene is dooooope.

Volunteering? Yeah! Tons! I might specifically suggest BEACON. Which teaches English as a second language to our thriving immigrant community. I’ve taught and it’s a lot of fun giving people the ability to live their lives more fully here and take all of the advantages that being here gives them.

"I like Manassas downtown as there is always something going on. Including live music during warmer days.

I’m not a white person but what little encounters I had with the Manassas Police has been good.   

Manassas has a decent mix of cultures/ people. I will say it is majority Hispanic.

There are many apartments and only spot I would avoid is the Georgetown Manassas area, which is considered the “ ghetto”

One thing I hate about Manassas is that trains are frequent and I cant stand the noise. Will be moving farther out as it drives me crazy.

We have decent Wine festivals and  traffic can be rough due to rt 28, 234 and rt 66.

I’ve heard bad things about over by the hospital but only rumors.

When I went looking, most of the assaults took place in Old Town meaning drunken Friday night fights. 🤷‍♀️

I would ask your neighbors when you move since they’ll know where exactly might be shady.

I guess it’s just a bit ridiculous for me because I’m from outside of Philadelphia where there seemed to be a murder a night in the city so like...Manassas actually seems A LOT safer to me. 😂

Like when people said “Georgetown South—watch out!”

And then my husband and I drove by it the first time and saw gorgeous old townhouses and white picket fences I just 🤷‍♀️. Yeah...there are more black and brown people there. Yeah, they HAD an issue with gang violence because of short term leasers, especially during The Recession, but they also have a community center and community events and I dunno...just seems a bit like...white flighty to me.

"I live in Manassas, and if I plan on taking a day trip to DC, I will usually drive to the Metro station in Vienna.  It has been a while but if I remember correctly, you'll ride the orange line in to the station then switch to the red line(?) which will take you right into the mall with all the museums, right by the Washington Monument.  I also recommend waiting for the rush hour traffic to clear out, otherwise it will be wall to wall, non-moving traffic, especially because there is roadwork going on around the Centreville and Fairfax exits. 

As for Manassas restaurants, I don't venture much outside the main stretch on Sudley Road ( I hate driving), and most of Sudley is filled with chain restaurants.  The hotel you're staying at is right off Sudley, so if you want some non-chain restaurants, you might have a little bit of a drive.  Old town Manassas has some stand alone restaurants that are pretty good.  My husband and I love Okra's Cajun restaurant.  https://okras.com/

That hotel is also right next to the Battlefields, so plenty of Civil War history there.   There are also memorial spots in old town, near the train station.  I play Pokemon Go there quite often, so it is relatively peaceful, except during train arrivals, but it is kinda fun watching them come and go. 

As for areas to avoid...  I can't really name any off the top of my head other than a few little rough areas, but not dangerous rough, just slightly run down and a little over-crowded  (not the type of ""Bunker Down in your Car and Lock the Doors"" rough). 

Also, if you're looking for something fun for the kid, the Fair Oaks Mall (I think it is exit 58 off the main highway going into DC) just opened a Dave and Busters last week.  I know... I know.... no chain restaurants, but it is worth mentioning just to go there for the games! :P",t2_dc88q,Booner999,0,1554833179.0,0,t1_ekhju8d,ekhju8d,True,[deleted],t3_baysi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/manassas/comments/baysi2/visiting_for_one_day/,Visiting for one day,/r/manassas/comments/baysi2/visiting_for_one_day/ekhju8d/,3,r/manassas,0,3

"Hello and welcome!

Manassas is great! It looks terrible but those strip malls hide lots of fun stuff to do! We have a trampoline gym, two laser tag places, the mall has go carts and bowling there’s a fun pool hall...what else...I mean old town is great for restaurants but don’t be afraid of the rundown shopping centers either! They have awesome Guatemalan and El Salvadoran food! And Sushi! 

Also, if you haven’t had Peruvian chicken before—get it. Get the green if you like spicy and the yellow if you just want delicious.

Manassas has lots of different festivals in Old Town, usually centered around food or alcohol. 

I would recommend living here rather than elsewhere. A) it’s almost affordable compared to anywhere else in NOVA B) there’s enough to do here that you probably will only go into DC rarely and C) not having much of a commute is soooooooooooooooo niiiiiice! 

Your work folks will be your best chance at friends so see if there are happy hours or game nights or things to do with them!

I wouldn’t worry about any bad areas. Even the supposedly “worst part” of Georgetown South is really nice. I think it’s more of a white people being afraid of black/brown people than an actual horribleness to the area.

"Hi!  

I've lived in Manassas for about 9 years now!   Just a few hints / tips.   Try to rent in the 20109 or 20111 zip since 20110 is more expensive and costs more for auto insurance (City of Manassas instead of Prince William County). 

 Try to stay away from the Georgetown South and Coverstone area.   I didn't think that area was too bad, but my husband, who has lived here all his life, said that area was known to be rough. 

Lockheed is super easy to get too off of Ashton Ave.   If you can find an apartment off of Ashton, getting to work will be easy since traffic usually sticks to Sudley and Sudley Manor drives.   I lived in Barrington Apartments for several years until I bought a house, and they weren't too bad (maybe a bit pricey but that is everything in Manassas now), plus, Barrington is next door to a church with 3 pokestops and 2 gyms if you're into that (the Manassas PokemonGo community is huge).

"It really depends on where you are; some apartment complexes have FiOS available, he have Comcast/Xfinity. I don't know if Cox has any foothold in Manassas.  There's also satellite-based (Hughes or Exceed, but those are expensive and limited enough that they're only worth considering if you literally *cannot* get service from anyone else). Verizon and other cell carriers offer 4G-based home internet, which is better than sat, but even more expensive. (I know all of this from having tried to find internet service for my house out in the Stafford woods, two years ago). 

Just go to various providers' websites, or call them. They will be able to tell you whether they can offer service at your address, and what the price tiers are.

"You are right. ""Mockery"" was exaggerated on my part, but the flag is pretty bad. There are several city flags out there that have the same basic design: solid color background with the seal on top of it. It is a pretty lazy move when designing a flag. You're totally right about the taxpayer dollars. I talked with the communications manager and said if there were to be a new flag, it would have to wait until next year as all the flags were already bought for this year. Not to mention that there's the political side to all this as well. I have been messing around with a few designs but it's under wraps until I have some pretty great designs.",t2_y2sdu,FivesAndSeven,0,1468127197.0,0,t1_d56cu7m,d56cu7m,False,FivesAndSeven,t3_4k94lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/manassas/comments/4k94lb/manassas_flag_redesign/,Manassas Flag redesign,/r/manassas/comments/4k94lb/manassas_flag_redesign/d56cu7m/,1,r/manassas,0,1
