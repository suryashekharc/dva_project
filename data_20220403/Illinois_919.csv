yesss that describes it so well! (The part about using Chicago as a punching bag to reinforce downstate beliefs about urban life).

If you pull out a gun on someone, and they have a gun on their person (Which they might, even if they haven't brandished it), *they will shoot you.* They'll shoot you because you just gave them good reason to believe their life was at immediate risk.

And, frankly, depending on how you look (You're young, so that's gonna work against you) and how much of an antique the gun is (Is it obviously old and not likely loaded as a result?), it might have the opposite effect in making it look like you're a sheltered teenager trying to look tough by LARPing with their functionally-a-prop gun. I'm not trying to insult you, I'm being realistic about how people might perceive you from a third-person perspective. 

I'd recommend you really take a moment to think about this critically. Do you genuinely live in such a dangerous area to where lacking a firearm would be dangerous? If you want to de-escalate a situation and just keep yourself from getting hurt, learning self-defense and snagging some pepper spray will be far more effective in achieving that goal, without running the risk of getting you caught up in legal trouble or, y'know, dead.",t2_jhq9g,RasputinsButtBeard,0,1648937476.0,0,t1_i35oj0u,i35oj0u,True,[deleted],t3_tut12c,https://www.reddit.com/r/illinois/comments/tut12c/anyone_know_if_you_can_open_carry_an_antique/,Anyone know if you can open carry an antique firearm with no ammo without an FOID?,/r/illinois/comments/tut12c/anyone_know_if_you_can_open_carry_an_antique/i35oj0u/,3,r/illinois,0,3

">. So WHY would you HAVE to sample it when you come to Chicago? You should go and try local places that are unique to the city.

Come on. You're really going to pretend deep dish is the same in other cities? And Lou's website says they only have 15 locations outside Illinois. So no, that's not something ""you can get anywhere."" There's only one major city you can get Lou's at outside the Midwest. That shows it's rare outside Chicago, and once again, from Chicago-based chains because it's the only pizza style invented in Chicago. You're trying too hard.

"Pensions - especially Illinois's public sector pensions - are good for the pensioner because they're effectively riskless and very lucrative until you die.

Edit: there are a lot of reasons you don't see pensions anymore, but a big one is that the state (or company) owes you a defined benefit regardless of if they have the cash to pay it.

"What job did you have w/ a pension plan? (You don't need to be real specific, just the type of job and type of employer)

Pension is bad for you if you don't do service years to grow it (Salary x Service Years x Multiplier) . 
So obviously 10 years at a ""low"" final salary ($70k) nets you a small pension; at the state employee formula, about 10k (800/mo) a year at 65, but it grows annually and pays for the rest of your life. And pays your spouse 50% on your death.  
Purchasing a similar annuity in the wild would be crazy expensive. 
So career workers who do the 30-40 years obviously fare much better.

"That sort of contradicts the key findings of the report as written here:

""Eight of the 10 states most dependent on the federal government were Republican-voting, with the average red state receiving $1.35 per dollar spent.

Nine states sent more to the federal government than they received — seven of these were Democrat-voting and had higher per capita GDPs than many of the red states that received the most.""


You cannot deny that red states take in more federal money than they contribute, the math is all there. It shouldn't be a surprise that states with lowest tax rates take in the most since they in turn provide less back to their constituency and therefore rely on the federal government to make up the difference.

 >The Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) is an administrative agency of the U.S. state of Illinois charged with building, operating, and maintaining toll roads in the state. The roads, as well as the authority itself, are sometimes referred to as the Illinois Tollway. The system opened in 1958 in the Chicago area, and has subsequently expanded to include the eastern and central sections of Interstate 88 (I-88) extending into the northwestern part of the state.

"No, you're better off just getting the plate. 

If the cops see you around enough without a front plate they'll pull you over anyways and if you have lived here for more than 30 days there's additional penalties for not registering your new address within the time limit and not registering your car, it's tantamount to driving without a license so like $1500 in fines.

"Hi, I'm a former CRSS in Illinois that worked for NAMI Metro Suburban. The chapter I worked for or possibly the DuPage chapter should be the closest ones to your friends location if they need in person. I know the MetroSuburban chapter has 3 different living room locations where an individual could call or come in person to have one on one sessions with someone who has shared experience and can help guide along the entire process of recovery including finding resources, obtaining therapy, hospitalization assistance, medication and insurance assistance and referrals (at least telling you where to obtain these things). You may also call (708)524-2582 from 1-9pm 7/365 including holidays and reach an individual with shared experience and training to talk to you and help assist in any way you may need over the phone. Transportation assistance is available on an emergency basis but is generally required you transport yourself to and from each location if going in person. That being said they are helpful with setting up public transportation routes or if you have disabilities and are otherwise encumbered finding a transportation service that can help you. All services they provide are free and if they refer you to a service will be sure to tell you if it isn't free and what to expect from it. The drop in center is located in oak park so it may be a bit far for your friend, but it is the main community location. Most of the large groups are held there and you are able to attend without a specific reason or topic to talk about and hangout in a healthy mentally rejuvenating environment. This also houses the jobs program and has more direct access to community resources such as food, referrals etc.. If you have any questions call the number above during those hours, or visit their website at namimetsub.org. You may also call them and get the contact information for the DuPage chapter if it is indeed closer.",t2_82ry74v3,KyotsuNagashiro,0,1648584813.0,0,t1_i2lyklw,i2lyklw,True,soundsystxm,t3_tr96zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/illinois/comments/tr96zy/mental_health_resources_in_illinois/,mental health resources in Illinois?,/r/illinois/comments/tr96zy/mental_health_resources_in_illinois/i2lyklw/,13,r/illinois,0,13

"So I just got a new (to me) car and forgot about the transponder for several days, then decided to go online, add the tag, and pay any unpaid tolls. It wouldn't let me pay any unpaid tolls once it associated my tag number with my account.  

I put a transponder from another vehicle into the new car and it's been working fine. Husband took the car I borrowed the transponder from and didn't realize there was no transponder.

Here's what happened.  Two weeks later, I am looking up all activity, and I noticed that there are *video tolls* registered to the cars that didn't have transponders in them on the days we went through.  I know there's a limit to the number of non-transponder tolls you can have during a certain period of time, but my guess is that since you updated your card, you're fine.

We had the expired card thing a few years back so they sent us a letter, and it was easy to clear up.  I've heard horror stories about unpaid tolls, but in each case, it was because the violator blatantly ignored any and all correspondence and attempts to collect. My guess is that the tollway authority gets so many unpaid tolls that they are just happy to accommodate anyone who's actually willing to try and square things up with them.",t2_35vmc7qm,inoffensive_nickname,0,1648567896.0,0,t1_i2kq213,i2kq213,False,Delicious_Stuff_3243,t3_tqnk3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/illinois/comments/tqnk3q/what_does_this_mean_account_has_license_plates/,"What does this mean?

"I had the opposite happen. I brought family out who had never been to Illinois (or the midwest) and they were impressed.

The midwest, Illinois, and Chicago in particular, get a bad rap in other parts of the country. Their expectation was murder and cornfields.

And sure, they got cornfields, but they also got the cleanest major city they had ever seen (downtown Chicago is immaculate compared to NYC, SF or LA), tons of things to do, and very nice people.

Illinois the state and Chicago the city are severely underrated, in my opinion.",t2_e3o1094n,Ok-Cartographer-5544,0,1648565991.0,0,t1_i2kl88s,i2kl88s,True,3y3lashes,t3_tq0xb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/illinois/comments/tq0xb9/ever_had_outofstate_family_come_to_il_and_not_be/,Ever had out-of-state family come to IL and not be impressed?,/r/illinois/comments/tq0xb9/ever_had_outofstate_family_come_to_il_and_not_be/i2kl88s/,3,r/illinois,0,3
"I’ve lived in Illinois my whole life. I’ve lived in rural areas, multiple parts of the city, and the suburbs. I also have cousins who live in SC. I can understand why your guests weren’t charmed. 

My cousins like that they can drive a few hours in one direction and be in the mountains.  A few hours in the other direction, you’re at the ocean. Illinois’ topography is mostly flat except for a few moderately hilly areas out west near Galena. Just “going for a drive” here is not scenic, especially at this time of year. 

Although I jokingly describe myself as the only girl who will get misty-eyed over flat fields of grain, I really find driving south of Chicago moderately depressing. My friends were so excited to take me camping in Shelbeyville one year and I thought it was horrific. I was expecting the “north woods of Wisconsin”-type camping. It was a lake surrounded by corn fields with little natural beauty. I’ve never gone back. 

I’ve nearly fallen asleep driving to Champaign and Danville. Holy cow is it a boring drive…and I’m someone who actually likes farms and grew up next to one!

Starved Rock is pretty. I’ve hiked it. To those who have hiked the mountains, though, it’s probably a little underwhelming.   

And while I would bike and run the beautiful lakefront when I lived in the city, it has  never occurred to me to drive to the city to go to the beach. It just seems counterintuitive. Schlep through city traffic for a day at a crowded beach? No thanks. I’d rather drive to the Indiana Dunes.

Suburbs like Lake Forest have beautiful beach fronts but actively discourage people from out of town from visiting by having no parking without a residential permit actually near the water and charging an obscene amount for a family of 4 to get in. Having visited Michigan, which has awesome beaches along Lake Michigan, I’ve often wondered why the heck we can’t figure out beaches here. I mean, lots of people talk about having a vacation home in Michigan, but do you know anyone who has a vacation home in Illinois? (Okay there are some up by the Chain of Lakes but I’ve lived there too and it’s not even close to the beauty of Michigan)

Having traveled to St Louis where we kept getting our wallets out every time we parked and went to an attraction and were surprised to be told it was free, your cousins also may have been a bit surprised how much you get nickel and dimed here. It was so noticeable in St Louis that it became the running joke between my husband and me…every time we got to park for free or go into an exhibit for free and think what the same experience would have cost us in Chicago, we’d say “that’s the price of corruption in Illinois.”  It was a little sad actually. 

Our cousins also think our taxes and COL are outrageous compared to theirs and so maybe your cousins had their expectations really high thinking “it must be out of this world if you’re willing to pay to live there.”  If that’s the case, I can understand their disappointment. They set their expectations too high. 

Coming from SC, your family may not have been up for a day of sight seeing “in the big city.”  Personally, it’s not my cup of tea either. I’d rather go to a single museum and have a nice lunch than schlep from sight to sight. 

So, yea, Illinois is not for everyone. But it sounds like you were an engaged and generous host and your cousins should have expressed more appreciation for your effort.

"I spent a number of months in Greenville, SC, which is 40 minutes WSW of Spartanburg. It's warm, there are nice trails, and things are generally lush and green.

Drive 20 mins here, 30 mins there, 30 minutes back... 4 hours to the beach? Lol. It's also some 2 hours to Atlanta and Charlotte, which is just far enough to be a pain if you hit traffic.

"Part of my job is in foreclosures. I talk to every homeowner in foreclosure in my county at some point in their case. Before the change in the law I talked to maybe 2 folks who were in foreclosure due to gambling. Since the law change it's about 10% of people I talk to. 

And it's usually the spouse, not the addict themselves. The addict will secretly take out a second mortgage to finance their addiction. Or raid the savings accounts and retirement accounts. I've talked to people who discovered their partners addiction when the process server showed up with foreclosure papers. At that point ***their*** life is ruined right along with the addicts life. 

So if we want a society where a mental illness is allowed to ruin someone's life, we also need to change the regulations to protect those around that addict. That probably means a mortgage will be harder to get.

It's specifically that these pop up casinos are meant to catch people with a problem and prey on their addiction.

"IDK if it's the same for sports betting, but when I worked in marketing in a casino the only regulation I really remember there being in IL is that we always had to include the ""1-800-Gambler"" disclaimer on all ads. I'd assume sports betting ads have to do the same? It doesn't diminish the impact of any of the ads, but if someone's at risk they can call that number and get connected to the Illinois Gaming Board and self-exclude themselves from accessing sports betting or casinos.

Gambling establishments can face MASSIVE fines for letting people slip past that system; at least where I worked there was a massive network of info to catch self-excludes and call IGB on them if they try to sneak in. No clue how that would work in sport betting (I left that job shortly before it got established) but I'd imagine there's similar programs in place to stop folks who can recognize that they're at risk and sign up for it.

"That Stuart Lake biography was somewhat of a chicken-and-egg thing.  When Hollywood really got going in the early 1900s, Wyatt offered his services to the burgeoning film industry as a ""technical consultant"" of sorts, which largely consisted of him sitting around film sets and telling tall tales about his contributions to taming the Wild West. (Of course, Earp's contributions to ""the world's oldest profession"" were conveniently forgotten...)  
Those tales were collected by Lake, as well as other stories volunteered by Earp, and became the basis for that exaggerated biography.
