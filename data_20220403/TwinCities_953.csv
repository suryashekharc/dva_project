"From the article:

With a month to go before the city’s new rent control ordinance takes effect, St. Paul’s Department of Safety and Inspections on Friday published lengthy draft rules that would allow landlords seeking waivers to incorporate inflation and “self-certify” residential rent increases above the voter-approved 3 percent rent cap but below 8 percent.

A public comment period on the rules will run from April 7 to April 22.

“What we are looking for is a review and comment from the public, from all sectors, on everything that is presented — the rules, the process,” said Suzanne Donovan, spokesperson for the department.

The 17-page draft rules, published to the city’s rent control website, detail how a landlord can seek a hardship exemption to the new 3 percent cap on annual rent increases, which goes into effect May 1.

The ordinance crafted by housing advocates and approved by voters on the November ballot indicated in general terms that landlords have a “right to a reasonable return on investment,” but it left it to the city to flesh out the process.

That process, detailed for the first time on Friday, will be finalized on the city’s website on April 29. Intake forms for landlords will be available by May 1, when rent control becomes the law of the land.

WAIVERS

There is no provision in the ordinance that requires tenants be notified when a landlord seeks or receives a temporary waiver from rent control. If a tenant believes their landlord is not following the ordinance, they have the right to file a private legal action in court or file a complaint with the city seeking an investigation.

To calculate a reasonable return on investment, the new draft rules indicate the city will use the landlord’s “maintenance of net operating income,” or MNOI, and allow rent increases that cover increases to operating costs and allow for inflation-adjusted growth in net operating income over a proposed base year.

For most landlords, that base year will be 2019, according to the draft rules.

Under the draft rules, a reasonable return for landlords takes into account the Consumer Price Index: “A landlord has the right to obtain a net operating income equal to the base year net operating income adjusted by 100 percent of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), since the base year. It shall be presumed this standard provides a reasonable return.”

According to Donovan: “Offering the inflation rate would only be one factor that might be considered under the proposal. All of the factors would have to be addressed.”

Landlords and tenants can make a case to the city that 2019 was an “exceptional” year at their property, and expenses were “unusually high or low in comparison to other years.” An exceptional circumstance might include maintenance and repairs, eviction or temporary reduced rent, among other considerations.

DEFINITIONS

Under the definitions, gross rental income does not include utility charges for sub-metered gas, electricity or water paid directly by the tenant, or charges for trash disposal, sewer service or other services provided to the tenant on a pass-through basis.

Operating expenses can include management and maintenance costs, property taxes, licensing and registration fees and landlord-performed labor with documentation of date, time and rate, among other expenses.

Landlords seeking rent increases between 3 and 8 percent can “self-certify,” meaning they simply fill out an intake form with the appropriate documentation and submit it to the city. There’s a worksheet they can fill out to help determine their maintenance of net operating income and costs of capital improvements. Those forms may be audited by the city.

After submitting the intake form, the landlord can expect to receive an email with a notification document they can forward to their residents indicating they’ve requested a rent increase using self-certification.

Landlords seeking to increase rents by more than 8 percent need to seek a determination from city staff. A negative determination can then be appealed to a legislative hearing officer.

Rent increases for unit-specific capital improvements can be allocated to a single unit, while rent increases for building-wide or common area improvements need to be allocated equally among all units. Other provisions explain how owner-occupied units, new units added to an existing dwelling and vacant units should be treated in the calculations, as well as “conditional rent increases” based on future expenses, including capital improvements.

MORE INFORMATION, HOW TO COMMENT

More information is online at stpaul.gov/rent-stabilization-rulemaking.

Residents can submit comments online, by email or by sending a written letter to DSI-Rent Stabilization, 375 Jackson Suite 220, St. Paul, 55101.

The new rules seek to clarify basic definitions and the application process for hardship exemptions, but additional changes are likely. At the request of St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, a 41-member stakeholder group is weighing potential amendments to the rent control ordinance. The mayor has already submitted a draft amendment to the city council that would exempt new housing construction from rent control for 15 years.

“That’s a whole separate and parallel process,” Donovan said. “They are looking at policy issues. This rent-stabilization rulemaking website is about how to implement the ordinance as it exists.”

In addition, the St. Paul City Council is scheduled to vote April 6 on some basic definitions of legal terms such as change of occupancy, rent and tenancy.",t2_41f6q,Sequiter,0,1649000270.0,0,t1_i38fc6u,i38fc6u,True,Sequiter,t3_tvc01s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tvc01s/st_paul_rent_control_draft_rules_allow_landlords/,St. Paul rent control draft rules allow landlords to ‘self-certify’ increases over 3 percent,/r/TwinCities/comments/tvc01s/st_paul_rent_control_draft_rules_allow_landlords/i38fc6u/,7,r/TwinCities,0,7

"The fact that you and I are getting downvoted for pointing out the absurdity of using a realtor these days is comical.  They are desperately clinging to their scam because it has been unraveling for years. From yesterday’s Star Tribune:

https://m.startribune.com/pandemic-created-an-influx-real-estate-agents-but-there-are-few-houses-for-them-to-sell/600159670/

TLDR:  There are more licensed real estate agents in the state today than any time since 2006.  There were only 2700 residential home sales in February in the Twin Cities.  The bar to become a licensed real estate agent is so low that it only requires 30 hours of education and $63 to take the licensing exam. 

So much for the “training” necessary to handle a real estate transaction. The comments on the article are largely in agreement with our comments.

"Yeah, don’t get a realtor. I had a realtor for my last sale and purchase. I found the buyer, who would have bought without all of the expensive upgrades we “had to do” to sell the place. I also found the listings for every house we looked at, including the one we ended up buying. 

Realtors don’t find you a buyer or find you a property any more. I guess you need them to list your house on MLS, but you can do all the looking yourself. 

Realtors take a percentage of the sales price, so they have no incentive to find you a lower priced house to buy. And, even though they benefit from selling your house at a higher price, the market really decides the price so they benefit more from a quick sale (less work for them). They just push paper around. It’s the title company and closers that really do the important work. 

I’m buying a property right now. I found it. I negotiated the price with the sellers. And I’m going to end up paying a lawyer about $750 to get the paperwork done. It’s a good deal for me and an even better deal for the sellers because they don’t have to pay any commission to a realtor.",t2_aw1a7zpx,Dont_Wanna_Not_Gonna,1,1648958548.0,0,t1_i36ne47,i36ne47,True,Nezteb,t3_tuxxjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/tuxxjr/realtor_recommendations_for_the/,Realtor recommendations for the EdenPrairie/Chanhassen/Chaska area?,/r/TwinCities/comments/tuxxjr/realtor_recommendations_for_the/i36ne47/,-6,r/TwinCities,0,-6

"We had Genz Ryan out last Fall. The guy tried to claim he legally had to lock out our old furnace even when I told him we were still getting other quotes. Our house has a carbon monoxide detector for every room, plus one next to my bed... The likelihood of the old furnace being so dangerous he had to imminently red tag it seemed low so I said he couldn't (esp because it was like 50 degrees that day.) He insisted he couldn't leave without locking it out, he's sorry, but I'll have to just go get electric space heaters until we replace the furnace. I went to get my husband & the guy magically changed his tune that ""well, I don't legally have to... But you need to replace this old furnace sooner than later.""

  
Ok. Had three other companies out that day for quotes. Every single one of them came in more than $2k lower for the furnace + ac package we were looking at. Every single one said our current furnace seemed ok safety wise, but the risk that it might die during a cold snap might make us want to deal with it earlier in case the install teams are too busy to come out right away.

Woodbury sprawls and it takes forever to get places (lots of traffic lights). It doesn't have the best variety of places to eat. But you are close to other cities that have better food choices. Easy access to St. Paul via 61 and Shepard Rd if you want to skip the freeway. The interchange at 94 and 494\694 is horrible and the main backup of traffic on both interstates in the area. It is the largest eastern suburb and tries to mimic the western burbs but falls a little short. Overall it isn't too bad though.

">Woodbury is close to the St Croix, Afton Alps,

To me, this is what really sets Woodbury apart from Maple Grove, imo. The St. Croix River Valley is a treasure and to live within a 10-15 minute drive from it is special, if enjoying nature and having some solitude is important to you. There's river itself, as well as Afton State Park, Belwin Nature Preserve, Carpenter Nature Center and St Croix Bluffs Regional Park all just a short drive away.

"Good: Woodbury has lots of public space -- parks, playgrounds, schools, etc. It's big enough to have almost one of every store you'd want and it draws from the less populous east metro cities around it. Lots of residents making lots of money so lots of tax revenue to do things and keep them maintained. Less than half an hour away from downtown St. Paul. Quiet once you get away from Radio Drive, Woodbury Drive, and Valley Creek. 

Bad: Lots of tract housing/McMansions (*lots* of it) by the same developers, so many neighborhoods are just tiny variations on some theme of ""modern American traditional."" One neighborhood in Woodbury looks pretty much like the next one. Or the one the same developer plopped down in Maple Grove. Or Victoria. Housing is kind of expensive by metro standards and not all that well built or distinctive. No downtown as such; get in your car and drive. Even some of the shopping centers (like Tamarack Village) are not conducive to keeping the car parked and walking to different shops. 

By suburban standards that's just the way things are and it's probably no different in Maple Grove.

"Sure, easy just like gender studies, Latin, Greek philosophy, communications, or a wide range of many available degrees. Probably more ""useful"" than a lot of other degrees though. Also many cops don't have a ""criminal justice"" degree but other ""normal"" ones. As long as you have what they call the ""skills"" certification, a degree is a degree. Does a college degree necessarily make someone smarter? No, but that goes for all college degrees. 90% of what you learn is on the job training. A lot of trades don't require a degree but train you on the job, and many people in trades are a lot smarter than college grads. 

And a college degree is required in MN to be a cop. There is an exception if you have 6+ years of LE experience in another state. But pretty much all departments already require a 2-year, if not a 4-year degree nowadays, making that situation very rare. Plus nobody moves to MN from somewhere else. Probably a couple dozen people total in the state? And if the degree is so easy, why wouldn't you just get it.

Newer cars all have at least their front running lights on all the time, and that's a big help.

However, they *don't* have their taillights and side markers on. I routinely see people blissfully driving down the street at 10pm totally blacked out from three sides.
