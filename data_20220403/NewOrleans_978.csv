You can get a lead test kit from SWB [here](https://www.swbno.org/DrinkingWater/LeadAwareness) but know two things about it: 

- It comes with [a letter](https://imgur.com/a/NeoyuBM) that tells you how dangerous lead is, but also denies that SWB has responsibility to fix the issue except the main line to the water meter and blames *your* pipes instead

- The results are difficult to parse for non-science folks such as myself and apparently [this NOLA.com contributor as well](https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_00727ec6-57c4-5520-afd2-a0c4c90e537f.amp.html)

Anyway, the generator burns through a full tank every 24 hours.  TL;DR: Those little 20 pound bbq-size tanks will only last a few hours.  Size of the place is a handful of offices and a conference room; AC, lights, and a few computers.  Refrigerator in the break room, I think.  Never really noticed; I work in the field.  About the same as a house if you're not running a washer and dryer.  I'd consider getting natural gas piped to your generator if it's in your budget.  That seems to be what most people do.

"**Vanilla is a spice derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily obtained from pods of the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia). The word vanilla, derived from vainilla, the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself meaning a sheath or a pod), is translated simply as ""little pod"".**

At Jockeys, there is a wine called Magical Nights on their wall of drinks. Inside the bottle was the clue: “The City’s #1 grandson was on the wrong side of history, but due to his history he has a place.” That clue refers to Charles Gayarre who was a supporter of the confederacy and was the first mayor of New Orleans’ grandson, and was a historian.

"Welcome to the hippo hunt. This is a multi location hunt. That means the first clue should get you to an initial location. From there you can find what you need to figure out the the general area of the second location. Once you get there, a combination of the second clue and things at that location will help you discern the third location. And so on. 

The hippo prize is at the end, hidden in a clear ziplock bag. 


NEW F.A.Q. FOR THIS HUNT:

This hunt is MOSTLY (but not always) on public property and the locations are NOT necessarily open 24/7. Pay attention to signage at your locations so that you don’t get stuck anywhere after dark. This isn’t as ominous as it sounds…you’ll know what we mean once you get there. You will not need to enter anyone’s house/apt or talk to any resident to solve this hunt! 

DO NOT take or move any additional clues that you may find with you. Feel free to take pics of clues, etc., but leave everything in its place so that hunters behind you still have a chance to catch up. This obviously doesn’t apply to the hippo prize. If you find her, she’s yours, and you’ve won! Please just comment “found” asap so that others know to stop hunting. 

Finally, this hunt is loosely based on random Reddit content — so if you hit a clue that stumps you…you know where to look for help. This doesn’t apply to all clues however. 

If you’re stumped for real, feel free to comment here or DM us on insta @cluesbeforebreauxs. We will not give out hints via comment or DM but if there is need, we will start dropping hints on insta and Reddit on Sunday around noon if the hippo hasn’t been found. If the hippo isn’t found by Monday morning, we will re-hide her soon. 😈

Happy hippo hunting!

"I honestly wish I would've had more time to research when we bought our gas gen, but we waited until last minute and didn't have a ton of options. I have 2 propane tanks I barely even use that would be perfect to just keep on standby for a storm vs keeping multiple gas cans around and rotated so they don't go bad. Propane tanks are safer and take up less space, so that would be something to consider too when living in the city.

"El Gato Negro: Inside seating. Very cool Old Gretna walkable downtown. Their food is always 100% fresh and really good, and their margs are well made and they have tons of tequila. I think their fajitas and entrees are better than their tacos. If you go there, get the lamb chop dish. Shit is fantastic.

Barracuda: More casual but also a very cool neighborhood and great vibe. All outdoor seating, string lights, etc. This is more of a ""taco stand"" situation. To me, they have the best tacos in the metro area. They come dressed whereas El Gato's tacos don't.

So I'd say if you're looking for a more casual, outdoor, marg and street taco vibe, go to Barracuda. If you're looking for a more sit down, top shelf marg situation, go to El Gato.

Both restaurants are in very similar, old school, cool neighborhoods, both near the levee, both very walkable.",t2_hd9132it,muhquestionsdoh,0,1648918960.0,0,t1_i34l2ic,i34l2ic,False,No_Distribution_5174,t3_tua56r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tua56r/best_margaritas_on_the_westbank/,Best margaritas on the Westbank?,/r/NewOrleans/comments/tua56r/best_margaritas_on_the_westbank/i34l2ic/,1,r/NewOrleans,0,1

When I lived Uptown, my roommate joked that people on the Eastbank would easily drive 45 minutes to Metairie to go to Home Depot, instead of 15 minutes to the one right across the bridge on the Westbank.

"A sewer line burst at Oakmont Apartments in mid-December, about a month after Rochee ""Roe"" Jackson took a job as the only maintenance worker at the crumbling, 336-unit complex in Algiers.

Backups spread across the property. Residents ripped plywood sheets from boarded-up windows and doors to lay across the sewage-laden grounds. Four months later the break remains, unrepaired.

“From the feces to the drugs, it’s third-world-country s---, basically,” Jackson said. “What some of these families are going through in these apartments at Oakmont, it’s enough to make you cry. I’ve seen poor, and I’ve seen people live bad. That goes beyond.”

Jackson quit over pay on Feb. 16, the same day the office manager bailed, leaving no staff at Oakmont, the largest of five New Orleans rental properties that landlord Joshua Bruno placed under bankruptcy protection in January to fend off foreclosure.

Tenants and their advocates say Bruno has forsaken the complex. Some residents report sewage coating their apartment floors. Last week, a three-alarm fire broke out.

The blaze erupted just as Bruno’s largest creditor, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, was filing an emergency motion asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Meredith Grabill to wrest management of Oakmont from Bruno and place it with a trustee.

Fannie Mae argues that Bruno can’t be trusted to manage the 16-acre property and needs to go fast. While tenants live in squalor, Bruno has transferred millions from Oakmont over the past year to other entities he controls, the lender claims.

Grabill on Thursday set a May 23 date for a mini-trial.

“We’re at the fork in the road,” she said. “This isn’t just about money in this case. This is where people live. We have health and safety issues at play here.”

'Insider transfers' an issue 

Attorneys for Fannie Mae argue that $7 million in suspect “insider transfers” from Bruno’s rental properties to other entities he controls reveal a “severely conflicted judgment.” They say that alone warrants appointing a trustee.

But Fannie Mae claims Bruno also siphoned $800,000 in insurance money for Hurricane Ida repairs to the complex without the lender's knowledge. Attorney Edward Arnold III said Bruno submitted invoices from another firm he controls, Downtown Development Group, which is not a state-licensed contractor. Those billings wildly inflated the cost, Arnold alleged at a court status conference Thursday.

Bruno’s actions were “unbelievable in terms of inter-company billing, the overhead, the excess profit,” Arnold said. “We’ve got to have somebody in here to fix these properties who is licensed, insured and who is going to do the work properly ... There’s still insurance money missing that we have no idea where it went.”

Advocates say tenants now occupy less than half of Oakmont’s apartments, while squatters and rodents have descended on the property. Firearms are a frequent sight at Oakmont, often toted by youth, said Jackson, the former maintenance man.

“I was out there picking up trash one day, I turned around, it’s some little guy in the bushes and he has an assault rifle. He tells me he’s no problem for me. But you’re standing in the bushes with an assault rifle,” Jackson said. “The tenants are like prisoners in their own homes.”

Frederick Bunol, an attorney for Bruno, came armed with an olive branch Thursday, saying for the first time publicly that the landlord is ready to turn over management of his New Orleans properties, though he wants to continue overseeing repairs.

He said Bruno, president of Metro-Wide Apartments, bought all of the properties in bad condition and fixed them up before COVID-19 and a long-running moratorium on evictions came along.

“The properties went down, and we had (Hurricane Ida) and the properties went down further,” Bunol said. “We fully recognize that there’s a major sewer leak that needs to be addressed, major repairs that need to be made.”

Bunol urged an agreement to skirt a hearing focused on the grim conditions at Oakmont and his money transfers, which Fannie Mae says he has yet to explain. Bunol said Bruno was in a better position to launch repairs now that he’s collected millions of dollars in insurance proceeds and other funds, including more than $800,000 in rental assistance.

Bruno “has only had funds to make these repairs for two weeks,” Bunol told the judge. “Mr. Bruno has an interest in the properties being worth what they were worth a couple years ago. We’re looking for a path forward.”

'Absolutely deplorable conditions'

The city cited Bruno last summer for a slew of code violations at Oakmont and nearby Cypress Park, which is also in bankruptcy. Bruno’s appeal of those violations is on hold while the bankruptcy plays out.

Fannie Mae is asking Grabill to appoint trustees over all five of Bruno’s New Orleans properties as the bankruptcy process plays out.

The other three are Forest Park Apartments, Liberty Park Apartments and Washington Place Apartments on the east bank.

Fannie Mae lodged emergency motions for all five complexes, including Oakmont, where tenant advocates say living conditions deteriorated before Hurricane Ida and have only gotten more dangerous.

Several tenants and the New Orleans Renters’ Rights Assembly have joined in urging Bruno’s ouster.

In one affidavit, a tenant who uses a wheelchair said his apartment has “continuously” flooded with sewage water since December. Another tenant swore in a recent affidavit that “when people in my building flush their toilets, it backs up into my apartment.”

Some Oakmont tenants live now with no electricity, said Hannah Adams, a staff attorney with Southeast Louisiana Legal Services who represents the tenants. She told Grabill that many of the problems predated Hurricane Ida and that conditions have gone south in the past few months.

“My clients are living in sewage, are living without water, without electricity,” Adams said. “They are living in absolutely deplorable conditions that could have been remedied.”.

Jackson said Bruno refused to replace old appliances or hire people to fix busted AC units. Mold had spread into the bulk of apartments. He said Bruno told him to mask it with bleach and Kilz.

After the bankruptcy, the city offered relocation and rental aid to remaining tenants. A city official said 15 tenants have been approved for moving help, and that the city has paid off their back rent.

After tending to the grounds at Oakmont for three months, Jackson said it wasn’t enough.

“Why the city, why the mayor would allow this place to remain open is beyond me,” he said. “No one should be allowed to live in that apartment complex.”",t2_2n972t0v,causewaytoolong,0,1648902126.0,0,t1_i33mr5q,i33mr5q,False,Fluid_Pomegranate587,t3_tuepi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tuepi3/conditions_crumble_at_algiers_apartment_house_as/,Conditions crumble at Algiers apartment house as landlord Joshua Bruno faces ouster,/r/NewOrleans/comments/tuepi3/conditions_crumble_at_algiers_apartment_house_as/i33mr5q/,7,r/NewOrleans,1,7

"I can't post the text, because I only have a phone...but tl;dr: slumlord Bruno claims the pandemic wiped his cash flow so he can't take care of his properties where residents are literally living in sewage. But, he's also transferred money from these properties to other businesses he owns including an unlicensed contracting company. He pays himself to fix the apartments in false invoices. He's supposedly willing to get out of the rental game.


Bruno is such a fucking sleazeball and I'm glad the government is putting him in his place, although he deserves another kind of justice. I met him twice, once after I responded to a false ad on Craigslist way back. He had a buddy working for him who showed me all of these shitty apartments. Apartments with just a hot plate and a fridge. I told buddy that his friend was a slumlord, profited off of Katrina at the detriment of locals who lost their homes, and has stupid marketing practices. When we got back to the office, Bruno came by and I told him to his face those things and he kicked me out. Then, a year later he comes by the bar I managed and stiffed the staff on a $300 bill. When I approached him asking if there were issues, he said ""They only poured drinks, it's not like they did any actual work."" Dude needs to get his comeuppance.",t2_c6oc3k5z,Fluid_Pomegranate587,0,1648891361.0,0,t1_i3391r3,i3391r3,True,Fluid_Pomegranate587,t3_tuepi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tuepi3/conditions_crumble_at_algiers_apartment_house_as/,Conditions crumble at Algiers apartment house as landlord Joshua Bruno faces ouster,/r/NewOrleans/comments/tuepi3/conditions_crumble_at_algiers_apartment_house_as/i3391r3/,21,r/NewOrleans,0,21

"\*shoots at you from a dodge challenger on I-240 with temp tags\*

So in my early 20's I lived with a server/manager of Gus's. Every night he would come home with a giant brown paper bag full of fried chicken. Back then it was 3 guys sharing a fridge and beer would disappear so I started getting really into jug wine because they wouldn't drink it.

I have a lot of really solid memories of eating cold gus's, cold jug red wine and world of warcraft with the NIN playing at 2am. 

This was right before 9/11 and things were optimistic and I thought working with computers would eventually make me rich and getting laid more.

Anyway, yeah that chicken is fire. I think the places down here have it right too, like it tastes just like Memphis. 

I say I need to go back to Memphis and kick it but it's almost hurricane season so I might be back whether I like it or not.

"Huh, fair enough. Thank you for clarifying and giving us the facts. Maybe most of the disparity in my mind between which one was more popular is due to my age. I was in my teens to mid twenties during the Nickelback years, while Imagine Dragon didn't start until I was already grown. I was never a big fan of either, but also didn't really dislike them. Of course I meme'd along with everyone else, but I never had any real strong feelings about either. 

I guess my feelings toward Nickelback and IG are roughly analagous to how I feel about Limp Bizkit and Dashboard Confessional, respectively. Not strong enough good or bad, but I've definitely jammed to their shit at some point. I'm sure they both have merits far beyond however people meme on them. It's really funny because Nickelback went platinum 7x but  you'd think they must have just bought all their own albums since everyone hates them and thinks they're trash, lol. With Imagine Dragons I didn't even know it was the new meme to think they're bad. I always thought they had that catchy pop tune ""Radioactive"" and they sang at the LoL World Championship in like 2013. I thought that was pretty cool. I dislike someone like DJ Khaled more than either of them.",t2_4nkay,jermdizzle,0,1648850186.0,0,t1_i31dfod,i31dfod,False,Cajun_Sensation_,t3_ttbv4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/ttbv4w/careful_out_there_yall_i_had_2_imagine_dragons/,Careful out there y’all.

Help me to continue this prayer into everything I do this day.

"Hard to answer that in my opinion. Junction is really good if you want a fancier burger. Bub’s Burgers on Banks St. makes a great smash burger. If you want a solid old school local fast food style burger then Bud’s Broiler is a must.

Blue Oak BBQ also makes a great burger as well. There also use to be a BBQ joint on Magazine called McClure’s that close about 5 years ago I think that was really good. They used Two Run Farms beef. One of the best burgers I’ve ever had. They use to have a location in Nola Brewing as well.

"I frankly think the whole 'transplant/native distinction' thing is just used as a way for people to feel better about themselves. Cause like, I'm sorry, but, say, a Vietnamese guy who spent the vast majority of his life in New Orleans is still closer to a native than someone whose roots are in the city for like 300 years but moved to Nebraska as a kid. It's about a shared culture and shared collective experiences, not the exact city limits of a neighbourhood you grow up in. And no one in their right mind can possibly tell me the culture of, say, Jefferson, St. Tammany, St. Bernard, Tangipahoa, etc are so drastically different from Orleans that they're practically aliens if they move there. Yeah, sure, not *exactly* the same, but they're all a part of a general South Louisiana culture group. We all grew up with our grandparents making gumbo and jambalaya and etouffee, we all grew up wondering when the next hurricane was going to come, we all remember fanning ourselves in the shade and eating snoballs on hot summer days after the third 10-minute rainstorm that week, we all know what it's like to stand along a parade route during Mardi Gras and listen to the bass drums boom as the marching band goes by. And as for the transplants? They didn't grow up with it, no. But *their kids will,* if they stay. Unless there's some kind of special boarding school for only transplants, even if their parents are as un-Creole as humanly possible, they're going to grow up in our culture because that's who their peers are.",t2_14ayur,SSeabury1313,0,1648836823.0,0,t1_i30htae,i30htae,True,plates_25,t3_tqyjqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tqyjqq/ive_been_told_to_go_back_to_where_i_came_from/,"I've been told to ""go back to where I came from"" like, 3 times in the past couple weeks",/r/NewOrleans/comments/tqyjqq/ive_been_told_to_go_back_to_where_i_came_from/i30htae/,1,r/NewOrleans,0,1

"There are plenty of good men working out of their truck. The whole company means the whole overhead as well. Giving smaller contractors a chance to build their business while the big guys go chase those monster jobs should be the goal. If they aren't looking out for you, why would you support them. Help small business owners.
A note on price, wood is expensive right now, almost [triple](https://fortune.com/2022/01/12/lumber-prices-skyrocket-again-weather-sawmill-production-supply-chain/amp/) what it was in 2019  Cedar is about 30% more expensive than pressure treated. So that $1000 dollar fence you built back in 2015. Forget about it. That same fence is $3k easy. If your material is $1000, expect any contractor worth his salt to also charge $1000 in labor. If you want to know if your contractor is competitive, figure out his markup. I would also be wary about a contractor that gives you a super low price. Either he's bad at math(never a good sign in a contractor), or he's a grifter taking deposits and heading for the hills. You can price most materials on homedepot.com to get a ball park estimate, then double that number. That's your fence.
