"There is fairly adequate public transportation here. Bus system, Uber, Aggie Express Taxi, call a friend... People who drive drunk usually have choices, they just choose to drive drunk. Perhaps bars in more areas of town could be a solution. For instance, I live in far south CS and have to drive 15-20 minutes to Northgate or Dowtown Bryan to find a bar. And it's a long drive back. For years I've been waiting for a bar to be built within walking distance of me. This would cut down on drunks having to drive well across town and back after a fun night. Instead they could walk. But the city clusters all the bars in one area (NG,  Downtown Bryan) and forces people from all over to go to those areas. But, drunk driving is a phenomenon everywhere. We happen to live in a college down with 50+ thousand students + residents so it is bound to be worse here by nature.",t2_22ulvg0,CSDCSL,0,1648782294.0,0,t1_i2xqrnx,i2xqrnx,True,Difficult-Counter147,t3_tt14ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/bcstx/comments/tt14ko/i_read_a_lot_of_post_about_drunk_drivers_in/,I read a lot of post about drunk drivers in BCS.Other than police what other ideas do anyone have to get this under control just want to get a total count but clicking upvote and I'd like to read suggestions under the post.Lets hear them,/r/bcstx/comments/tt14ko/i_read_a_lot_of_post_about_drunk_drivers_in/i2xqrnx/,2,r/bcstx,0,2

"The issue is that they have a lot of 5g towers up, but they don't have sufficient bandwidth feeding the towers (called back-haul). So the speed from your phone to the tower may be good, but the speed from the tower to the internet isn't. It's something they are working on, but it's going to take a while, as they essentially have to build an entire back-haul fiber network from scratch to feed every tower. A 5G network with 100% coverage is useless without a fiber back-haul network. In my experience it's actually worse.

I have the exact same issues that you describe with Verizon, and my girlfriend has it with AT&T. One thing I do that helps immensely is to use a VPN, like Nord VPN, Surfshark, etc. Often carriers know that they have limited bandwidth at the towers, so they are throttling everyone in an attempt to make sure everyone gets a small slice of the pie. Using a VPN bypasses the technology they use to throttle. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before they figure out how to throttle you regardless, but it works for now.

\- Something recorded with video cameras (can be cheap or expensive studio cameras)  
  
Where are you streaming to?  
\- YouTube – Facebook  
\- Subscription based website or private events and conferences  
  
Other factors-   
Audio – can you use headsets or do you need microphones and what type, area microphone, wired, wireless, etc.  
  
Lighting – Unless its something like a large conference or sporting event, you will most likely need lighting.  
  
Internet connections – At home or the office, you will know what you are paying for and should be stable. I have been on location where the client said they had really great internet- upon setup no one has the Wi-Fi password and the router was locked in a cabinet so I couldn’t even plug a cable in.  
  
Check out the ATEM Mini by Blackmagic Design. It is a box that takes camera inputs,  converts the signal, and lets the computer see them as a webcam. There are various versions of the ATEM Mini. Just google the name and there will be tons of info on how to stream.  
  
You do not even need OBS with the ATEM. You can use it in conjunction if you want to have some other features added in. If you need to do events for profit and/or take calls to run it like a podcast I would recommend Vmix or Wirecast. It is paid for streaming software with extra features; such as, streaming to multiple services simultaneously.

So put the price, square footage, and bedroom and bathroom account in the post title, and just use the word ""sublet.""

Also, if you're moving out and not living with them, why does it matter what gender they are?  I'm not trying to start an argument, I just find that confusing.

1. Is it because you currently have a roommate who will still be living there? If so, that seems like an important thing to mention in the listing.
2. Is it because you intend to be short term roommates, for like a week or something while you move out? If so, then similar to the above, that's another important thing to mention in the listing.
3. Is it because you're leaving behind some items that only women would be interested in? If so, what items?
4. Is it because the management has separate buildings or floors based on gender? I've heard of that for college dorms, but your post sounds like you're talking about an off-campus apartment, and I've never heard of an apartment that does that.

"I end up at Cafe Capri in downtown Bryan quite often. It's nice and also casual. 

I like downtown Bryan a lot. It has really come a long way in the 20yrs I have been here. 

Fancy: Ronin, Casa do Brazil, The Republic, Christopher's and Paulos. About $50 per person.

Hamburger: Smitty Ks, Top Of The Hill, Edge General Store, Koppe Bridge. 

Pizza: Antonio's is my favorite. Mr. G's and RX Pizza  in downtown  Bryan (again).  There are a few new places that I hear are good but I can't remember the names.

Pasta: Cafe Capri, Paulos, Luigi's, lots of others 

Steak: The Republic, Ronin, Casa do Brazil. All $$$ but good. Big steaks for cheap: Longhorn Tavern or Sodalaks on Hwy 21.

Chicken Fried Steak: Longhorn Tavern

Dental services such as fillings and extractions are NOT offered at the dental hygiene clinic.   
Anyone can request an appointment with the clinic. Services are provided by dental hygiene students under the supervision of a general dentist and dental hygiene faculty, all of whom are licensed in the State of Texas. Since this dental hygiene clinic is an educational setting, students are in the process of learning to perform thorough assessments and services. Therefore, multiple visits should be expected and time spent in the dental hygiene clinic will be longer than a typical visit to the dentist.""",t2_ne9zf,Kevinatblinn,0,1627877013.0,0,t1_h7e4tjx,h7e4tjx,True,achilles3980,t3_ovwecl,https://www.reddit.com/r/bcstx/comments/ovwecl/dental_w_no_insurance/,Dental w no insurance?,/r/bcstx/comments/ovwecl/dental_w_no_insurance/h7e4tjx/,3,r/bcstx,0,3

Lived at laurel ridge for a yr close to the Valero gas station off of winter park in 2018. After first month ac went out. Was given 2 window units for 2 months. Then they took 1 back. Needless to say at the 6 month mark I left bcuz they still hadn't fixed the ac. Well they said they did but it was still reading 86 on thermostat...also a lot of people walking around the complex at night and during day had a few things stolen off porch. Never really had any threatening crime that I knew of at the time.. lot of cops drive through to use as a detour from Bryan and College station. not sure about the other complex lol hope this was helpful.

1 Meth only stays in your system for 48 to 72 hours. Has it been 48 to 72 hours? Just hydrate a moderate amount and catch the midstream in the piss cup, you don't want the beginning or end of your piss in the cup.

2 Drink so much water that your piss is clear. Your test will come back dilute and result in a retest a few days later.

3 Go to walgreens and get a drink called Qcarbo32 or whatever they have that has a similar name. It's nasty and costs like $40 but drink it a few hours before your test and you might pass. No guarantees here.

4 Go to any smokeshop/ sextoy store and ask for fetish pee. Fake piss for passing drug tests are illegal in Texas, but fetish pee isn't. Heat the bottle up in the microwave, wrap a handwarmer around it and hide it in your undies and you'll pass 99% of the time.

If the Biden infrastructure proposal gives Amtrak the authority to use eminent domain to buy out Union Pacific on those tracks, that would be amazing.

"BTU expects no changes to customer rates.  Customers who may have difficulty paying their bills are encouraged to contact BTU at 979-821-5700 or [**contactBTU@btutilities.com**](mailto:contactBTU@btutilities.com) to inquire about payment arrangements and assistance.

The biggest reason for price stability is that fixed rates require a utility to purchase energy needs (primarily gas) for the long term, as well as plan for energy production (incl. wind and solar) - and over the long term - and have co-operative partners (the more the better).

So, the contracts for gas are set. Passthru billers are reflecting the short term or spot wholesale market. These billers hedge the contracts negotiated in the long-term with utilities and benefit both natural gas wholesalers when the spot price (and, essentially, the long-term price) goes up beyond the future price negotiated. The billers tend to level prices for long-term purchases. If using a spot-market biller, it may be advantageous to keep an eye on the [Realtime Market Price contour map](http://www.ercot.org/content/cdr/contours/rtmLmpHg.html) provided by [ERCOT](http://www.ercot.org/).

So, it pays to have an agency (ERCOT) that works and has teeth. It pays to monitor the sources required by utilities when those utilities are constrained by fixed prices. It pays to buy energy on the long-market not the spot wholesale market. It pays to control billers in a way that is consumer friendly and consumer-informing so that there are no surprises - as basing prices on the wholesale spot market will always result in highly volatile pricing vs fixed pricing. And it pays to conserve energy.

Finally, BTU's prices are lower for BT City power than for BT Rural power. This is due to longer transmission lines and connect for rural customer.

# HISTORY, A GORY EXAMPLE AND OTHER LINKS:

[BTU](https://www.btutilities.com/) (Bryan Texas Utilities) is 100 years old but really came ""online"" in the 30s as a result of the [Rural Electrification Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Electrification_Act) or REA, an infrastructure effort from the New Deal under Roosevelt. Many REA co-ops today, performing only transmission and buying power strictly from other power generating utilities, still save their customers money over non-coop public utilities or Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs). BTU does both transmission and generation in concert with its partners. It is a non-profit utility owned by the municipality. This is a good thing. BTU likely has the solar, wind and gas generation in place with it's 3 partners in a way that is cooperatively beneficial.

But what about prices?

To be clear, fixing prices at only one end of the market and/or only on a sector of a market, is potentially fraught with problems and has historically been a bad idea. A flavor of this [pricing craziness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_California_electricity_crisis) happened 20 years ago in the State of California when wholesale prices were free to swing against Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) only (*the PG&Es etc*) that had fixed prices. If BTU is stuck with fixed prices and cannot negotiate long-term contracts with suppliers, it would behoove them to take note of history.

After the twiddling of the energy markets in the name of deregulation under California Governor Pete Wilson (R), the next Governor, Gray Davis (D), was recalled when the state's energy manager, CAISO (the ISO equivalent to ERCOT) was the overseer of long-contract purchased energy (primarily gas) exempted from deregulation by REA co-ops and smaller public utilities, while IOUs (PG&E, SDG&E, SoCal Edison, etc.) were forced to purchase on the spot market. This, along with greater energy needs, and the large market withholding by Enron to drive price up, among others, resulted in crazy hikes in the wholesale market, inability of IOUs to purchase much energy because of the fixed rates with their customers, and very low energy reserves - as low as about 3%. This further resulted in rolling blackouts in Northern California, and rolling brownouts in Southern California - all having NOTHING to do with safety as may be the reason for today's rolling outages in California. Even the brownouts weren't black because CAISO was able to relieve that market with long-market purchased excess energy - something that the larger utilities (IOUs) were unable to do. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) was elected in a special election that recalled Gov. Davis.

In the event that your landlord/reality group DID do that, that's literally federal jail time.

BTU has been asked by several customers whether their utility bills will spike, as has been reported in the state and national media.  There will be no increase in fees or rates for BTU customers.

Bryan seems to be moving in the right direction, they are considering upzoning ""north of northgate""([see Febuary 4th planning and zoning commission meeting agenda](https://go.boarddocs.com/tx/cobtx/Board.nsf/Public)), but to my mind this is not near enough.

"Let me be frank, a 18-22 year old who can afford to rent a house for college should probably be the last people renting a house in a residential neighborhood.

Their 2-3 year place to live they they dont own, most likely don't pay for, and most definitely don't appreciate. Conner from the Woodlands never had household chores, never had to cut the grass and generally has zero experience being a homeowner and has even less interest in being one because they inherently view the house as temporary.

Let's face the facts, college students who have a house throw parties, dorm parties are a nonstarter and apartment parties are fairly lame. Don't party? Well blasting electronic music at 2 o'clock in the morning where is reverberates straight into your neighbor's 5 yr old daughter's room is more than an inconvenience.

Loud arguments with girlfriends at 10pm drunk girlfriends accidentally ringing the neighbors doorbell at 5am, sex with girlfriend in the backyard at 1pm.

Roughhousing with boys and breaking windows, smashing through fences, smoking way too much weed in the backyard, and daddy's jacked deisel F-250 wakes up the whole neighborhood and dents 2-3 cars with his tires after an all night rager with the boys.

"I generally like what Seth Sullivan has been doing, and his announcements. But I do worry about the overuse of ""evidence-based"" as a slogan. ""Evidence-based medicine"" sounds good, but it means that we aren't supposed to act on information that comes from observation - only from randomized, controlled trials. Insistence on ""evidence-based medicine"" is why all the major health organizations didn't recommend the use of face masks by the public, because all we had was decades of observation of their success in Asia, and we didn't have any randomized controlled trials (because it's unethical to tell half the nurses in a hospital that they're not allowed to wear masks, and because before the present pandemic we couldn't get a large enough number of volunteers to wear masks throughout flu season to see if they work - and now it would be unethical to tell half the people not to).

My favorite paper making this point is [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC300808/), pointing out that there has never been a randomized, controlled trial of parachute use for protection from falling out of an airplane. Many other important medical decisions have had to be made without this sort of evidence on either side, and when we are faced with major decisions (like opening schools or keeping them closed, or, in the bigger picture, reducing fossil fuel use or continuing to drill and burn), if we wait until we have the sort of ""evidence-based"" reasons, it'll be too late.",t2_c29k9,easwaran,0,1595797439.0,0,t1_fzc7msm,fzc7msm,True,patmorgan235,t3_hxxgg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/bcstx/comments/hxxgg5/sullivan_any_decision_to_delay_start_of_inperson/,"Sullivan: Any decision to delay start of in-person school in Brazos County will be evidence-based, made before scheduled start dates",/r/bcstx/comments/hxxgg5/sullivan_any_decision_to_delay_start_of_inperson/fzc7msm/,2,r/bcstx,0,2

She was outside for quite some time (people spotted her often and she was underweight) so she was either lost or abandoned. Either way, she's in a safe, warm place that has the resources to look for her owner. If they can't find one, she'll be up for adoption.

There are cheaper options of course, but they will be a little rundown and closer into campus, so more students may live there (although I recognize you will be a student as well).

Right down the street from the vet school there are a few options that are pretty good. 

[https://www.presidioapartmenthomes.com/](https://www.presidioapartmenthomes.com/)

Other than that, I'd look into duplexes and townhomes as well. You can probably find some that are the same price as an apartment, but you get a little more freedom on location. There are tons of duplexes all over Bryan and College Station.

"For hiking, Sam Houston National Forest is about an hour or so away, depending on which part of the forest you want to go to.  Locally, there's Lick Creek Park: I'm not quite sure I'd call it *hiking*, but it's a fairly large (523 acres), densely-wooded area out beyond major city development, with several nice walking trails and plenty of wildlife.",t2_8jleu,TheGreatTrogs,0,1552075450.0,0,t1_ei3coul,ei3coul,True,Brady_Cardia,t3_aykw5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/bcstx/comments/aykw5d/bryancollege_station_for_grad_students/,Bryan/College Station for grad students,/r/bcstx/comments/aykw5d/bryancollege_station_for_grad_students/ei3coul/,1,r/bcstx,0,1
"I'm a 30F professional in town. I really never get bored. Once she makes friends, I bet she'll have her pick of adult league sports teams, happy hours, book clubs. I've found a ton of my friends by joining a gym and joining an organization outside of my work. I usually struggle to fit things in.

The perks of living in a college town are inexpensive happy hours, tons of coffee shops to work, and inexpensive places to eat and activities. 

Downtown Bryan is where a lot of the mid-20s and beyond hang out on the weekends. They have several great places to eat, fun shops, and a wine bar that I frequent a lot. 

If she likes working out, there are so many specialty gyms popping up. Yoga, rowing, crossfit, and the Rec are all great and a huge opportunity to meet like-minded people.

There are several parks and trails where I take my dogs. Huntsville is 45 minutes away and has a huge trail. 

Also, as mentioned before, Houston and Austin are very close. I go to one or the other about once a month, where I stock up on things from trader joes.

She really shouldn't be nervous. 10 years ago this place probably had a reputation of not being too fun, but now it's pretty alright.",t2_9qy21,invinoveritas10,0,1552075000.0,0,t1_ei3c2ei,ei3c2ei,True,Brady_Cardia,t3_aykw5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/bcstx/comments/aykw5d/bryancollege_station_for_grad_students/,Bryan/College Station for grad students,/r/bcstx/comments/aykw5d/bryancollege_station_for_grad_students/ei3c2ei/,1,r/bcstx,0,1
"As others mentioned, the closest we have to hiking is the Sam Houston State Forest about an hour away.

Check out Downtown Bryan - there’s a less student-oriented area there, with restaurants and bars and live music, and various activities aimed at young professionals. Harvest is the best coffee shop in the region. The Downtown Bryan Association has information about local arts groups and programmers and maker spaces and other things like that. 

Houston and Austin are both an hour and a half drive away, and are both worth visiting for different reasons. Austin has the sorts of things it’s stereotypical for (indie rock and related things) but Houston has the amenities of a major world city (one of the top opera companies in the country, great art museums, ethnic neighborhoods with amazing Indian or Vietnamese or other cultural experiences, weird outsider art). 

But it’s definitely true that for someone not specifically affiliated with the university who doesn’t already have a local social network, it can easily be very isolating here. But the advantage of it being a smallish town is that you can quickly get to know a lot of the local business people and organizers of the various activities and help suggest the next developments in town.
