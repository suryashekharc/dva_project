"From the press release:

>the Ontario government is investing $21 million to expand William Osler Health System. This funding will help transform Peel Memorial into a new inpatient hospital with 24/7 emergency department and expand cancer care at Brampton Civic Hospital. These projects will improve access to much-needed services in Brampton, so local families continue to receive the high-quality care they need and deserve closer to home.

Also:

>As part of the 2021 Budget, the government announced $18 million to expand the Peel Memorial urgent care centre to 24/7 operations while awaiting plans for a new inpatient hospital. Today, the government is building on that investment with an additional $18 million to plan Peel Memorial’s transformation into an inpatient hospital with a new 24/7 emergency department. The new inpatient hospital will reduce wait times and expand services, including enhanced seniors care, mental health and addictions, rehabilitation and complex continuing care for patients and their families.

Last year, their recorded absences didn't come close to matching the phone calls I got. (4x daily calls 5x per week v. ~5 total absences on their report card).

"School messenger app only works for elementary.  You have to call your kids school to report absents for high school.  The messenger app is way more convenient.  I wish Peel would use it for high school as well.

Having said that when you get messages like that take them extremely seriously because the number of absents is part of your child’s school record and if there is a high number of absences it may affect their college/uni applications in the future.

If the absence were recorder incorrectly your school administrators will fix it In their record, but they won’t do that without talking to a guardian first.  And if they are not incorrect about absents then go parent the hell out of the kid skipping school.

"Hey, they allow walk-in but expect to wait till 1 and be sent home. I went twice last week (didn’t wait in line though because the line barely moved since 9am) there was a huge line up and saw a lot people going home without submitting their docs and mind you these people were in line since 8:30 am. 

I’d say the best option is send your docs via mail (they charge you $60. $30 for pickup and $30 for delivery)  or try checking for appointments multiple times a day and you might be able to find something for upcoming week. 

They aren’t processing applications for tourist visa. You need to apply for entry visa. Entry visa for 6 months takes about 7-12 days to process. I got mine in 7 days (last week) but it might take a bit longer now because they cancelled the 30 day tourist visa.

"Depending on just how ""native"" you wish to allow your property to go, you will likely receive push back from ill-informed neighbours who do not understand what you are trying to achieve.  As such, I would suggest starting a conversation with them now, about your intent (and why) so as to make them aware that you are NOT simply ignoring the upkeep of your landscape.

&#x200B;

There was a house in our neighbourhood that created a full on Japanese rock garden in place of their front lawn, with a large rock feature, shaped gravel, and isolated plantings.  It was beautiful, but so radically different from the surrounding homes.  Eventually, after spending thousands on creating it, they were forced to remove it and resod.  Apparently, the rock and gravel were considered ""hardscaping"", considered the same as concrete, which is (of course) nonsense.

&#x200B;

Your best bet will be to contact the City with respect to property standards and also with respect to what is allowed in place of ""grass"".  Personally, if they are going to allow people to astroturf their properties, letting people revert to native plants and shrubs should be a no brainer.

In the 1867 British North America Act, Brampton gets a shout-out.  While not *exactly* positive, this is the first and only known instance of Brampton being acknowledged in a non-negative manner.

I know Peel Memorial is not technically a hospital, but their urgent care is doing overwhelming similar care as many ER’s would cover. I know pre-pandemic it was operating something like 5x intended capacity, and just to take that away was unconscionable.

"Ok, so make sure you understand what people mean by legal tint levels.  If you look at the laws that were put in place just recently (2018?), the maximum allowable VLT level (Visible Light Transmission) is 70% for the front side windows.  That means that the tint has to allow 70% of light to pass through.   Many factory cars already come with a pre-loaded tint on the front windows, and it might be anywhere from 70-90% already.  70% isn't much, and the interior of the car and occupants is still quite visible.

When you go to a tint shop or online (even in this thread) you'll hear them quote 30% as the maximum allowed tint, which is kind of correct (100%-30% = 70%).  Now where it gets confusing for many is that the tint shops sell a 30% tint that isn't a 30% tint, it is 30% VLT.  That means it's actually tinting your windows 70%, not 30% - that's 40% below the legal amount.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYQ3ZrVGY80

Look at that video - the tints in the front are ~70% (likely lower because of factor tint + tint film) and the rear tints are closer to 30%.  I think most people when they think of tints want the tint levels that are in the back, on the front - and they believe that they are legal because (and as others have said) it's 30% tint.

You can even take a look at https://www.xpel.com/automotive-window-tint-simulator as they have a tint simulator showing you the different tint levels for the products they offer.  And finally, if you still decide to go through with tinting, I would recommend AudioHeaven in Richmond Hill.  They do (or did) quite a bit of work for the GTA car/owner clubs and I've had good work done by them before.  Good product, good service, good warranty.  Good installers and products cost a bit more, but bubbly peeling tint looks like shit and the removal and reinstall is expensive.  Do it right the first time.

I hope that helps - don't want you spending good money on tints and then more money on a ticket, and then having the tints taken off (though, the enforcement of tints is lacking, frankly).  Understand what you're getting into beforehand.

** The new tint laws also had some grandfather rules that I don't 100% understand, but if you follow the new laws you'll be in the clear.",t2_9p8rt,Maico80,0,1648650066.0,0,t1_i2puu9q,i2puu9q,True,Mr_Black_Mamba,t3_tr9q4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brampton/comments/tr9q4k/looking_for_a_good_and_affordable_window_tinting/,Looking for a good and affordable window tinting place,/r/Brampton/comments/tr9q4k/looking_for_a_good_and_affordable_window_tinting/i2puu9q/,2,r/Brampton,0,2

"Most likely over crowding and no functioning smoke detectors.

We know from the stories I posted 2 adults escaped unharmed, 1 person is in hospital with injuries, and 5 dead (2 adults 3 children) so already that is a minimum of 4 adults, and 3 children with another person who hasn’t been identified if they are a child or adult were all living in that house.

So a minimum of 2 families with at least one of them with children were in that home.  Due to the insane cost of living in Brampton there are a lot of homes converted into multi apartments, and very few are registered with the city.

- **Shitty DIY?** Let's face it, we **all** choose the cash option when we get work done around the house.

Yes, yes, I'm a horrible person for speculating beforehand.

"Slightly off topic but download the A1 Taxi app and take taxis over Ubers or at least compare the prices.

for example: Saturday I went to the TFC match at BMO field. There was 4 of us - standard Uber/Lyft still are only taking 3 passengers (no one allowed in the front seat). looked at an XL and it was $99. Got a van taxi for $75.00.

"To elaborate on this, Bike Brampton has a few opportunities that might be of interest to you (I'm not affiliated with them at all, btw).  These are all free (as in paid for by sponsors and probably your delicious, delicious tax dollars)

- Bike the Creek - June 18th - http://bikebrampton.ca/events/bike-the-creek/ - Annual event with routes around Brampton that focus on the N/S bicylce pathways in the city.  Skill levels and lengths of the routes vary (5 km Fmaily Ride to 65+ km rides)
- Community Rides - They used to run these every 2 weeks or so, all around the different communities in Brampton.  They would have a 5km fun ride and a 15km longer ride.   Slower pace for both, usually start/ended at a dairy queen/mcdonalds/etc... with a free treat at the end. edit: looks like they're back for 2022 - https://www.brampton.ca/EN/residents/Roads-and-Traffic/Cycling/Pages/Community-Rides.aspx
- CycleFest - https://bikebrampton.ca/events/bike-month/bramalea-cyclefest/ - not sure if this was affiliated with Bike Brampton, but was run out of the All Peoples Church parking lot, with a bbq afterwards.  For anyone concerned with it being affiliated with the church, I've never felt like anything religious was ever pushed during the event (or at least noticed).  Last time it was run was June 2019, no idea if they are doing it this year.

Once you attend a few of these, you'll get an idea of who the regulars are (e.g. kemosite was at most Community Rides on the west end) and you can find people that will fit your idea of what casual riding is.

"Insurance wise, you are not correct. If there is dash cam footage to show that your ability to keep a safe following distance was taken from you, and that safe following distance was eliminated but not by your own maneuver or anything within your control, you will not be found at fault. Especially if you have dash cam footage showing there was no prior road rage and therefore no reason to suspect the other driver would pull such a move. Even the most defensive driver in the world can get caught with this and I can guarantee that they would not be at fault if they have proof of it.

"So you have a few options. 
1.implants youre looking generally around 4k a tooth (you may be able to negotiate a slight discount if you're doing multiple) the process generally takes 4-6 months. You will have the metal portion implanted into the bone, it then has to heal before they uncover it and place the crown on top of the implant. 

2. You could also look into a partial denture, with the materials they use now they're fairly lightweight. 

Most implant procedures aren't covered by insurance just as a heads up. Whereas dentures are typically covered as a major service. 

3. Last option is a bridge, I personally wouldn't go this route as you have to structurally compromise 2 other teeth for the bridge and they typically fail in 10-15 years

1. It would be 3.5k to 5.5 k, if bone grafting is done. Bone is most important aspect. 
2.  Not too long, its like extraction surgery for most of the time.
3.  Its similar to an extraction. Easier than tough or complicated extraction. 
4. Pros: you got a tooth, no other teeth will be touched unlike a dental bridge. Your bone doesn’t go away as implant will be holding it. Cons: insurances don’t cover it, can have complication especially if your immune system is compromised i e diabetes, smoker. Also cost is a con lol. 
5. Any good oral surgeon or a geneal practitioner who does a lot of implant surgeries should be great. 

Also implants can have complications. You will need cleanings regularly, recommended every 3 mos. You won’t feel it is failing, until it is gone or too loose as it doesn’t have any blood vessels like normal tooth.
