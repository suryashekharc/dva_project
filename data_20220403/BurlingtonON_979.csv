"When I moved to Burlington a few years ago, I got Bell. They give me 50 down, 15 up, Crave HBO, and a basic package for TV I can watch on Apple TV, computer, tablet or phone, $110 a month, and also includes 4 network extenders. That’s more than enough bandwidth to do everything, price has never increased, and most importantly connection has been solid. Never dipping. 

Cogeco came to my door offering better service with guaranteed rate for ten years. Essentially 360 down, 30 up, about the same TV channels including Crave HBO, no range extenders (that was another $10 a month for 2) with phone, about $155. Tried it for a month, but gave up after two weeks. 

Internet speed was all over the place even with a modem swap. EPICO has a horrible channel guide, questionable search, and software on tablet/phone is no where close to the same quality and reliability as Bell. No Multitask option, frequent crashes or errors, and no Apple TV app or watch remote.

Just an FYI - the numbers on the chart are stacked and daily - you need to account for all elements of the stack AND factor in that the chart does not account for turn over - ie 10 people on Tues and 10 people on Wed are not necessarily the same 10 people, although they could be. In any case, On Feb 20 alone there were 17 patients in Halton hospitals that were covid positive (note the stacking). And I think it's fair to say that the 11 covid positive people in halton hospitals on mar 26 were most likely all net new cases, relative to those on feb 20.

That's mental illness/ germaphobe level caution if you won't take your mask off unless you know your hands have been cleaned. Last I heard the risk of transmission from touching things is basically zero. 

I do sometimes feel grimy when I get back to the car. I keep a big container of hand sanny in there and use it when I get back to the car. There would be zero excuse for me to ever be driving around with my mask on, it would be embarassing because it would show that I struggle with the simpliest of tasks.

"Sorry that I probably came off as aggressive towards you, your comment was pretty neutral and was just pointing out a way new parks can get created in a city. I've just grown tired of the same set of people in this subreddit that often rush to defend the City of Burlington staff and councillors when you point out their shortcomings and what I feel is their outright disingenuous behavior on this issue. I feel it is unacceptable to present plans and drawings that have no funding or proper plan behind them because of course without those two things they will never happen. However in the past when I've done this I receive multiple condescending comments back acting as if I'm being ridiculous and unfair and that of course all these wonderful drawings will come to pass, they just need more time...

"That has worked for new areas in so called green field developments like north of highway 5 by Appleby, these parks the city is talking about rely on the city purchasing land and doing it themselves in areas that are already built up. They *could* require condo developers to help pay for these parks as part of their community development fees that they pay to the city but instead they have used most of those fees for the type of public art installations I mentioned earlier. Seriously the money from paradigm paid for the portal in the parking lot downtown, I am sure the people that live there get far more joy from staring at it than they would from a parkette where they live...

They have failed to do what you have talked about so far and I see no signs that they will suddenly change course. It is the city that released drawings assuring us of new parks along Fairview for all the development going in there by presenting pretty site plans, none of which are funded. The buildings are going up, some are already completed. The same was done for development by Aldershot GO, lovely drawings by the city assuring us of new park space that still isn't purchased or funded.

Sorry but they have failed so many times to follow through on these plans *in pre existing areas* that I simply don't believe them any longer.

"> that “concept” drawing is as feasible as the “concept cars”

This is the issue I have with so many of the lovely drawings the city puts out about high density development in this city, it seems like all of them are pipe dreams that never seem to come to pass. They imagine all these nice parks and amenities but don't have the money set aside to actually buy any of the land to make those parks. Even if they used eminent domain, which has to be approved by the federal or provincial government, they still have to pay market value for the property. Any plot of land in Burlington is worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Any plans for new parks require millions of dollars of funding which is non existent. The city needs to stop using the funds from developer benefits to install public art like the portal downtown or the pipes plains road and use it for more beneficial projects like parks. They need to actually follow through on these designs or stop lying to people.

Now I wonder if the same set of people that frequent the sub will once again rush to tell me how wrong I am and that all these pretty drawing will come to pass. If they do read this I have the same question for them I posed *literally years ago*, where is the parkette for the people that live in the three building development at Paradigm by the Burlington GO station?

It was featured in drawings released by the city almost years ago as to how the area would not turn into a giant field of asphalt. I was assured that I was being ridiculous and that it would all happen. Well it's been another 2 or 3 years since I was told that on top of all the years before that and the people that live in that development are still waiting for their parkette, all I see is asphalt.

And no don't tell me about they just purchased the existing park from the lions club, that deal was put in place in 1991 and the city got it for substantial discount and it was already a park, show me where the funding is for the new parks they plan to make in existing areas where they plan to put tens of thousands of people.

"While I'd like to see more missing middle condos have to be part of the solution. We literally built 80% of our cities as unsustainable low density sprawl. And those who own in those neighbourhoods will fight tooth and nail against missing middle ""poors"" moving into their neighbourhoods into such scary things like, **duplexes**. Until Burlington changes it's zoning, condos will need to be built to accomodate the growth and housing needs.

One year, I guess the ice hadn’t completely frozen yet, and when I went down that side on an inner tube, the ice broke, I flipped over and ended up falling unconscious from hypothermia.

"I'm confused about this. On Monday wearing masks at my gym and my usual Tim's was optional. The staff weren't wearing them either. This was in accordance with the provincial mandate ending.

"Below is a statement of known facts, NOT OPINIONS.

The following symbols and corresponding meanings have been used by the Russian Armed Forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine \[17\]

Z: Attacking South-East Region such as Kherson, Mykolaiv, Mariupol. Deployed from Crimea / Rostov oblast, Russia

🅉 (enclosed in square): Attacking Kharkiv Deployed from Belgorod Oblast, Russia.

O: Attacking Chernihiv Oblast. Crossed border at Senkivka, Northern Ukraine.

V: Attacking North-west Kyiv Oblast. Deployed from Mazyr District, Belarus

The invasion has acquired the nickname ""Operation Z"", derived from the ""Z"" symbol.\[20\] The symbol is in the form of the Latin letter Z, instead of the equivalent Cyrillic letter З (Ze) used in the Russian alphabet, which has been described as peculiar considering the symbol's theme of Russian nationalism

The ""Z"" has been used as a pro-war symbol to represent support for the invasion despite the ambiguity of its meaning

On Instagram, the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) posted on 3 March that the ""Z"" symbol is an abbreviation of the phrase ""for victory"" (Russian: за победу, romanized: za pobedu), while the ""V"" symbol stands for ""Our strength is in truth"" (Russian: сила в правде, romanized: sila v pravde) and ""The task will be completed"" (Russian: задача будет выполнена, romanized: zadacha budet vypolnena).\[24\]\[25\]\[26\] The MoD later suggested alternative meanings for ""Z"", including ""For peace"" (Russian: за мир, romanized: za mir), ""For truth"" (Russian: за правду, romanized: za pravdu), and the letter Z inside the English words demilitarization and denazification, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has asserted to be the purpose of the invasion.

Another interpretation for ""Z"" is the Russian word for west (Russian: запад, romanized: zapad), to designate the Western Military District or west-bound infantry, or more generally to underline the Kremlin's imperial ambitions, with the ""V"" symbol similarly standing for the word for east (Russian: восток, romanized: vostok).",t2_kqze32oi,WarriorKnitter,0,1647925617.0,0,t1_i1mkkg0,i1mkkg0,False,ImAzura,t3_tcm259,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tcm259/pro_war_car_spotted_at_use_car_dealer_on_plains/,Pro War Car Spotted At Use Car Dealer On Plains,/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tcm259/pro_war_car_spotted_at_use_car_dealer_on_plains/i1mkkg0/,1,r/BurlingtonON,0,1

"Not all of them.  Some have the letter ""V""

Z is not included in the Russian or Cyrillic alphabet, with the letterinstead being taken from the Latin alphabet to reflect the pronunciationof the Russian word “за” which means “for”.

""за” has commonly featured at the beginning of patriotic Russian and Soviet Union slogans such as “за родину”, meaning “for the homeland” in Cyrillic.

The ‘Z’ symbol was featured alongside the phrase “за победу”, meaning“for victory” and with “за мир” meaning “for peace”, but has alsodominantly featured alongside the hashtag “СвоихНеБросаем” – roughlytranslating to “we don’t leave our own” in English.

What does Russia’s V symbol mean?

Russia’s use of Z and V symbols has been used interchangeably, with ‘V’also used in graphics to stand for ‘victory’ in Putin’s militarycampaign.

But it has also been closely aligned with the phrase “Сила правде”meaning “Power of Truth” and “задача будет выполнена”, which means “thetask will be completed”.",t2_kqze32oi,WarriorKnitter,0,1647924767.0,0,t1_i1mjbmi,i1mjbmi,False,ImAzura,t3_tcm259,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tcm259/pro_war_car_spotted_at_use_car_dealer_on_plains/,Pro War Car Spotted At Use Car Dealer On Plains,/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tcm259/pro_war_car_spotted_at_use_car_dealer_on_plains/i1mjbmi/,1,r/BurlingtonON,0,1

"Actually, speeding tickets technically start at 10 over, but as a paralegal who fights them for a living, I’ve never seen one issued for less than 15 over.

You cannot get a ticket for 1-9 km's over in Ontario. You’re correct about demerit points beginning at 15 over. My point was that you can safely drive at up to 14 over and you won’t get pulled over for speeding. On highways, you can get away with a little more than that — I rarely see one for under 20 over.

"When I worked at McDonald's as a teen, the owner Ralph Sgro, who owned all the Burlington franchises at the time told us he had bought the franchise rights to taco bell to keep the competition out of Burlington.

Not sure how true that is, but it seems more likely than anything to do with meat quality. Burlington doesn't have stricter health laws than anywhere else in Ontario.

I suspect that's why we never got a stand-alone Taco Bell but do have the KFC combo ones.

"It makes sense based on the logic of price increase of lumber, steel, cement and other materials that have doubled or tripled in price. However, double the price is like saying “we don’t want to lose money here, actually let’s make more profits than we originally were by charging todays market price”. It’s very obvious that they are taking advantage of the current cost circumstances and leveraging out the “pandemic” as reasoning. The cost increase should be shared with complete transparency to all buyers. Like where these costs are coming from and going with all the details that would be in proportion to new evaluation. They need to not explain in summary, but be exact with numbers like a professional developer. If this can be done, the cost increase would probably be justifiable at 20-25% increase with a new contract that can protect buyers from reoccurring events.",t2_4mkofpet,Paul_55_,0,1647843203.0,0,t1_i1i0vd0,i1i0vd0,True,stinkycheesetarts,t3_th1c36,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurlingtonON/comments/th1c36/adi_nautique/,ADI Nautique,/r/BurlingtonON/comments/th1c36/adi_nautique/i1i0vd0/,1,r/BurlingtonON,0,1

"If you're just getting started no need for fancy equipment. I use a $12 pizza pan I bought at bed bath and beyond and my parents use their 30 year old pans over the pizza stone we bought them as a gift thinking it would be a nice upgrade. 


 Try a bunch of different recipes to see what is best for you and your tools. Some recipes call for heats my oven can't handle well so I've moved on to others. I make my own pizza and really enjoy it. It's definitely best done on a day not at work so you can make your dough after lunch and leave it to rise until you want to eat in the evening. I use a simple recipe - flour (bread or all purpose both work), yeast, olive oil, warm water and a pinch of salt. Normally mix it up around 2pm and it'll be in great shape to stretch around 8-9. We've tried different sauces and toppings galore and have a lot of house favourite combos. 


When we experiment with new toppings or seasonings instead of a big pizza we do a ton of small ones so we can do different combos and taste test them all. Delicious science.
