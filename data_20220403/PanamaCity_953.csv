Amigos in 30 Avenue shops has a good happy hour. Pescado rooftop bar in Rosemary is unbeatable at sunset but good luck getting reservations. Blue Mabel is on the west end of 30A but their brunch is dynamite. I’d also hit up Bruno’s pizza for cheap dinner. Red Bar in Grayton is incredible but doesn’t take reservations and will have a wait. For coffee - Amavida or Black Bear. Seaside also has food trucks that are decent.

"1&2.  Try the Northwest Florida Water Management website (nwfwater.com) for info on hiking and camping (and springs).  The State owns a lot of the land around Econfina Spring on Hwy 20 north of Panama City.  There’s little development and you should be able to find some dark skies.
3.  Thai Chef on Cherry Street in the Cove neighborhood near downtown PC is good.
4.  No to fires being common.  Most of the woodlands you see, especially, on the east side of the County around the Sandy Creek area are owned by Deseret Ranches (the Mormon Church).  They have been actively cleaning up their debris from the Hurricane and either replanting or converting to pasture land.
5.  The mentioned Econfina Creek flows into Deer Point Lake, along with Cedar Creek and Bear Creek.  A good place to kayak is starting on Hwy 2301 at the Bear Creek bridge and boat launch.  If the water flow is high, or you’re a slow paddler, you might have to park a car at the boat launch on Cherokee Street where the creeks empty into the lake and drive back to the launch where you started (if you have two cars - the boat launches are about 2 miles apart by road).",t2_i99u8,dougrlawrence,0,1646931135.0,0,t1_i04jqxr,i04jqxr,True,PersephassaThePurple,t3_t8yrte,https://www.reddit.com/r/panamacity/comments/t8yrte/relocating_end_of_april/,Relocating end of April,/r/panamacity/comments/t8yrte/relocating_end_of_april/i04jqxr/,1,r/panamacity,0,1

"1. Trails are pretty good and max at 1 hr distance from anywhere from the city areas. 
2. There's plenty of big open parks in various cities around Panama City. Matter of fact the Lynn haven recreation center is under construction as it was heavily damaged from Hurricane Michael. But overall, you will find plenty of open parks to set up your sky viewing for your enjoyment. 
3. Already answered by fellow Redditor above. 
4. No, fires are not common in Panama City. Matter of fact this is the first occurrence of it, and I been living here since 2007. This fire which has given a name ""wildfire"" was born from someone burning trash in their home backyard (somewhere close to Adkins Ave) and that's how this mess has been created for the first time. 
5. We have a local zoo in PCB, along with plenty of deers in woods, and plenty of bird species in various parks/trails.

"Lil' Rascals on Harrison is a quiet hall with relatively cheap hourly prices. What used to be Corner Pocket and is now Craft Emporium gets a little more business and has more focus on availability of craft beers. It's a good atmosphere, but not the lowest cost. Fair prices, though. The Salty Hobo off of Beck/St. Andrews has a few tables that are all $1.50 a game, but you'll be lucky to get a table on busy nights and it is a full on bar with smoking allowed, which isn't necessarily a drawback if that's the vibe you want. There are other tables here and there like a couple in Oasis and a couple in Slapsticks (as long as they're open), but I would bet on those first three as top choices East of the Hathaway.

Beachside I am a lot less knowledgeable about where the best are. I know that Rocket Lanes used to have a bunch and I know there are a couple at the Salty Goat.

"There were two groups.  One of them was primarily a DDR/ITG group, but that machine is gone, the owner moved to Tally, and some of the rest also moved away.  Some of them are still around, I think, but closer to Callaway area.

One was a group that I hosted in PCB -- I have an StepManiaX cab, various bemani arcade-style controllers, and GH/RB setup.  We mostly played Pop'n, SDVX, and DDR/SMX.  Two of my friends moved away, and the rest were less interested, so the ""music game"" part of the hangouts kind of fell apart even though we still hit up the dance machine from time to time. 

There are also some other dance game folks around that used to play at the arcade in the mall or on the PIU in DnB, but I don't regularly see any of them. One guy actually refurbishes used machines and sells them... Mostly PIU, but if you're in the market for a Jcab DDR Extreme, he's looking to sell one locally right now.

"True story, Maria, the woman who owns it started off as a waitress at La Fiesta on 15th in PC wayyyyyy back in the 90's. 

Me and my family were eating there in November 2000 when the Presidential Election results were coming in on the news. I remember asking my dad at the restaurant, ""dad, who is the president gunna be?"" He goes ""im sure we will know soon, but nobody knows now. We can check when we get home.""

&#x200B;

Fast forward, Maria bought the restaurant over time on a rent to own deal, and took it over from the old owners. She put in a new upstairs only to have the Hurricane hit like a month later.

"We actually had a perfect experience with Tower Hill after Michael.

When we bought again in 2020 I specifically told our broker to get a quote from them but apparently they cater more to townhomes (like we had) compared to single family detached (which we bought). So we ended up going with Frontline. 

Just anecdote's from what I saw personally post storm.

Frontline 5 people I know had positive experiences with them. I don't recall hearing any negative.

Universal Property - the single person I know with them had to sue but won and got policy max on all buckets.

USAA - even worse than UP above. My attached townhouse neighbor just had their court case finish 6ish months ago. Our Tower Hill appraiser said we were a total loss on their first visit and we were fully paid out by January 19' while neighbor didn't finish fighting USAA till last summer.

The second one I adopted required surgeries, was neglected, and has hydrocephalus. She’s special needs but is the sweetest girl. Also hours away in the middle of nowhere. 

Found both on pet finder. Took months of searching and emails, and lots of let downs. I’d say search smaller areas and be willing to drive. Also be okay with an older dog… most people only want puppies, but there are a lot of good older dogs who need homes.

"I don’t live in PCB anymore so take these recommendations with a gain of salt, these are the trails we used to explore when we lived there. 

 There’s some sandy trails on the west end around (30.2595404, -85.9505802) we used to take our atv on and have seen a jeep/4Runner on before. Not completely sure on the legalities of it I think there might be signs posted not to drive but never had issues with police in the past. Also if you go down Wild Heron Way and take a right at (30.2677993, -85.9535028) that trail will go for miles up to the intercostal. Part of it is the edge of the conservation park so get through there asap so you don’t run into a ranger but other than that section the trails are used by hunting clubs and well maintained. Rarely ran into other people. Also Side Camp rd off of 79 turns into a dirt rd that’s maintained by a hunting club, they have a gate partway down the road though so you may not be able to go far if it’s shut.

"You're welcome! Many people have addressed the outdoor activites which are abundant here (hiking biking, fishing, boating, shooting, kayaking, paddleboarding) I should have added that:
1) Closest Whole Foods is in Destin, about 30 mins away, they also have Outlets for shopping; and

2) A lot of weekender options. Tampa is a 5 1/hr drive, Jacksonville is around 4 hours, Miami is around 9 hours, Atlanta is drivable too. So if you're a sports fan, you can go to  bucs or jaguars game pretty easily or see a Pelicans game in New Orleans.

Let's be honest, every place has drawbacks, so if I had to list some negatives, it would be:

1) people lack a sense of urgency here. You'll try to schedule an electrician or contractor and have to repeatedly follow up or wait a week for an appointment;

2) you can't get nonstop flights anywhere. You always have to go through a hub;

3) folks here cannot drive. And they really don't know how to merge into traffic. Drive very defensively.

"I moved here about 18 months ago (from Los Angeles, so I laugh whenever people complain about rent/housing here, they don't know how high it can get).

Everyone's likes/dislikes are different, so I can only speak my truth, which is:

1) PCB is awesome, love the people, yes it does get busy 8-ish months out of the year but you can plan around it;

2) the primary difference in cost-of-living seems to be in the housing market. Food, entertainment, gas, activities are pretty comparable to a large market city;

3) cross reference your proposed purchase house with FEMA flood zone map as that can make a difference in terms of insurance costs;

4) cross reference your proposed purchase house with which development zone it's in, as that can determine how high you can build, whether you can add retail and/or whether you can rent out short term;

5) in general, the further west you are, the more upscale/desirable. You say you have a good budget, that's a relative term. If you have at least $1.5M for a house, I'd look at Inlet Beach and Rosemary Beach near 30A. If in the $700k's, maybe the new Naturewalk Development off 98. If below $700k then the west end of PCB;

6) healthy eating options are slim. You've got 2 solid sushi restaurants (and that's relative) and Mediterranean options but you'll have to cook at home to eat healthy, this is the land of BBQ, burger, pizza and Mexican spots;

7) everything closes by 930/10. Whether that's a plus or a minus I'll let you decide;
