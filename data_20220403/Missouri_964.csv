They did not vote for it because it doesn't lower the big pharmaceutical companies from price gouging.  the government our tax dollars will pay big pharmaceutical the difference in price which is wrong they have a cure for type 1 but they don't want people to be cured because they won't make money. And the politicians won't receive their kick backs. People need to wake the hell up and quit voting party lines and start voting for WHATS RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE not for their pockets.

"Many reasons. Gas is cheaper in Missouri moreso than almost any other state. Land is cheap in most of the state too.

I used to own a delivery service and the number of people moving here from California and Arizona was mind boggling and almost everyone them told stories like that. They'd sell their duplex or house there for a couple hundred thousand then come here and buy a house for a hundred fifty thousand that would have gone for four hundred thousand there.

"There's a little bit of population growth from people who now work remotely, moving to the midwest from the coasts to get to lower cost of living areas.

There's a HUGE spike in the demand for housing due to investors and property management businesses buying up cheap(compared to the national average) properties to turn into rental properties.

Investors are coming from California, NY, Canada, internationally, etc and just out-bidding local buyers to buy up the majority of homes in certain price ranges.

They can offer cash, and a 10-20% premium on the price to corner the market.

Is becoming a very serious problem in the Midwest and South(generally low cost of living areas) that families can't buy homes at reasonable prices.  Everything is being turned into a rental at the sub-$300,000 price point.

If the trend continues, ""starter homes"" will be $400,000+ for families and everything priced under that will effectively be a rental owned by some huge property management investment conglomerate",t2_5xxmv,joeboo5150,0,1648996086.0,0,t1_i385xuf,i385xuf,True,khanzain,t3_tuyfnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tuyfnu/why_is_columbias_population_growing_at_the_rate/,Why is Columbia‚Äôs population growing at the rate it is?,/r/missouri/comments/tuyfnu/why_is_columbias_population_growing_at_the_rate/i385xuf/,1,r/missouri,0,1

"Go watch some videos from YouTuber Not Just Bikes. He does a fantastic job illustrating just how much is wrong with North American car-oriented development models. (For an even grimmer look, check out r/Suburbanhell/.)

The thing the vast majority of Americans don't understand is that it doesn't have to be this way. You can have amazing small communities with vibrant, quaint town centers and lots of active life without the endless sprawl of tract housing. You can have both small-town life AND the density required to make communities livable and walkable without a car. It happens all over Europe, including in countries with far lower density than Missouri. That's why a village of 3000 people in rural Germany or Sweden or Finland can have a railway station, because people invariably live close enough to walk to it and there's a decent chance they may not even own a car at all.I live on the north edge of Ozark, less than two miles from Springfield city limits, and yet if I didn't have a car, I would literally have no way to get into town. There is not even a bus, much less a train station, within several miles of me. (I can't even safely bike into town--every road between Ozark and Springfield is a narrow 45mph road with no shoulder and blind hills/curves!)

I tried to engage our local community Facebook group awhile back about developing some tasteful, historic-appearing low-rise denser housing (especially owner-occupied rather than rented, but a mix would be ideal) in downtown Ozark in an attempt to revitalize the quaint-but-mostly-dead courthouse square. Ozark COULD have a vibrant downtown--it already has the historic setting, the real estate for shops and restaurants, streets that could be made attractive for pedestrian-oriented development, and it could all be connected via walking paths to the new Ozark Mill/Finley Farms development. Small businesses downtown could thrive and Ozark could be a fantastic weekend destination for the 1m+ people who live in a 100-mile radius. The overwhelming response I got was ""OMG, no, we don't want some ginormous monstrosity of a condo complex blotting our skyline"" (not to mention some references to multi-family housing invariably being lower-income...because that's all these people are familiar with) along with claims that they like their small town and the rural, agricultural surroundings...completely oblivious to the reality that all that beautiful farmland is CONSTANTLY being gobbled up by developers throwing up endless neighborhoods of cheaply-built tract housing (whether affordable or McMansionesque). Pretty soon, we'll just be an extension of south Springfield and the nearest acre of farmland will be 10+ miles away. Densifying the downtown area would actually PRESERVE that pastoral landscape because fewer acres of land would need to be destroyed to house the people that want to ""get away"" from city life.

So to answer your question: yes, midsize communities like Columbia and Jeff City (and Springfield) absolutely CAN have thriving city life that is conducive to transit (check out that intro video on Not Just Bike's YouTube channel linked above--small cities like Haarlem and Utrecht and others with populations not far off of our midsize cities absolutely have all those things), and it's utterly a travesty that our biggest metros are almost as bad as our smaller towns.",t2_9vp524jf,arcticmischief,0,1648958766.0,0,t1_i36nsjx,i36nsjx,False,Caleb_F__,t3_tua183,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tua183/a_question_for_folks_on_the_right/,A question for folks on the right.,/r/missouri/comments/tua183/a_question_for_folks_on_the_right/i36nsjx/,1,r/missouri,0,1
"What are you making now? Missouri is a state with a lot of problems, but there are some good things. The state minimum wage has just increased to $11.15/hr, so you certainly won't be making federal minimum wage here. 

The biggest issue is that the state government rules very strictly. Cities are not allowed to raise their minimum wage higher than the state minimum, for example. State services are intentionally underfunded, so if you need something like food stamps, medicaid, or unemployment benefits it could take months to go through. There are three or four metro areas in the state with people and job opportunities, can't really recommend the rest of the state. Even though the job market is pretty hot right now I wouldn't advise moving without having a job offer and start date from a reputable, national company (do not move here based on a job offer from some podunk lawn care company.)

"I'm not a fan of nuclear energy. After seeing Russia attempt to use a Ukraine power plant as a weapon, I'm even less of a fan. You listed a lot of maintenance and upkeep expenses of green energy but we also have expenses with traditional ones. Gas cars are expensive to maintain too and those batteries only last 2 to 3 years where the ones in EVs last 8 to 10 years. My neighbor just replaced golf cart batteries, definitely expensive but she said it had been 8 or 9 years. It only runs a couple hundred to add a charging station to your house and charging stations are popping up all over. The coasts are not the only areas with cities. Most of the US population lives in or near a city. So most of the population can use EVs. We need to get the prices down, used ones can be affordable. EVs are selling very well and people just love them. True that all alternative energy production and implementation is in its infancy. We need to quit subsidizing fossil fuels and invest in R & D. There are always pros and cons. My gas furnace cost me a lot more this winter but it isn't old enough that I want to replace it.

"As far as impartial info about gas prices, it's really difficult. I'd say read a myriad of sources but always keep in mind the underlying motivations of the person or company behind it. 

Military, defense contractors, news media, all want people to panic about rising gas prices so we justify going to war. 

Environmental groups write about it from the perspective that reliance on gas and fossil fuels is holding us back, so high prices don't bother them. (I happen to agree with that stance, but I try to read other sources too) 

Economists might seem impartial but their bias is always toward market forces cleaning up every mess, without acknowledging the capture that industry has over markets (we do not live in a free market economy, existing firms can lobby to make it more difficult for new firms to enter the industry for example).

"The EV cars and public transportation great for the East and West coast large cities. They don't have far to go on a daily basis and the cities near by are so close that when one ends another begins. But in the rest of the country those options won't work, they are too far spread out and the chargers for the cars don't exist. If they did the people couldn't afford to buy them and maintain them like they can the fossil fuel powered cars. The batteries that power an EV are expensive to replace. More so than golf cart batteries and most people sale thier battery powered golf carts when it's time to replace the batteries. It's all good until the true cost of ownership rears its ugly head. Charging an EV right now damages the planet more than fossil fuel powered cars do, this is because most of the power plants in the US are still powered by natural gas and some use coal still and as they generate power to charge EV's it pollutes the environment more so than driving our gas guzzlers. Nuclear is the most efficient way to generate power in mass for human consumption that's clean for the environment as long as it's done safely and correctly. It scares so many people because if done carelessly in the wrong way it can kill and destroy everything around the Nuclear power plant for miles and miles not to mention the fallout that can spread in the wind whatever direction it is blowing when it happens. I know everyone screams solar and wind is safer but you need to store it to be able to use it, back to those costly batteries again to do so. I know many that thought solar was great when they first got it, then the cost of the batteries to store it came into play or the cost to  replace the solar panels when they are damaged or live past thier life cycle. Once again the true cost of ownership rears its ugly head and it puts a damper on the plan.

"Before Biden was in office, we had more crude oil being pumped out of the ground than we (USA) could use so we sold off the surplus to other countries. The Keystone pipeline expansion was going to be moving HUGE amounts of oil (30 mill gallons a day) that we were going to process, creating up to 100 thousand new jobs, opening previously closed oil refineries, helping grow the economy of every city and town along the pipeline, bringing in billions of dollars per year in new revenue.

Biden immediately shut down the building of the pipeline (the safest, cleanest and cheapest way to transport oil.) Stopped new oil drilling/pumping on fed land. Raised the costs of pumping oil on fed land that lower production wells are closed. Heavily regulated new drilling everywhere so the cost is not worth the risk of not getting oil. And so much more.

Now we have to buy oil at a much higher rate from foreign countries because we use more oil than we can now pump out of the ground.

Oil and gas futures are bought and sold in the stock market, this also has a big impact on oil and gas prices. I've never agreed with this, it's just another way for the rich bastards to make more money while fucking everyone else over.

"That's one definition of energy independence, which ignores the other energy resources which America is a huge exporter of. Coal and natural gas, namely. So, what you mean isn't energy independent, it's oil independent. And even there, as I pointed out, we were oil independent over 2021, it wasn't until this year that we trended away. And, you know, with the whole world going as it is, blaming our federal government for a trend we see globally is a bit much.

Does the federal government have a role in our gas prices? Sure, everything has some role, but it's dwarfed by much larger factors. 

But also, as I stated before, the right way to look at this is that pushing to drill and export more oil only continues us on the road towards destruction, so even if you WERE correct that Trump deserves praise for low gas prices (which, again, he doesn't, he sat on trends that were handed to him and at best didn't fuck them up too badly), he still doesn't deserve praise because simply relying on oil and not pushing for some better solutions is the sort of small minded, child-lacking-object-permanence brain move that only a failed game show host could want.",t2_6pk3s,Primesauce,0,1648910793.0,0,t1_i342vvr,i342vvr,False,Caleb_F__,t3_tua183,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tua183/a_question_for_folks_on_the_right/,A question for folks on the right.,/r/missouri/comments/tua183/a_question_for_folks_on_the_right/i342vvr/,1,r/missouri,0,1

"Well, Trump signed executive orders that opened up federal land for fracking and drilling.  He also had executive orders that removed some of the regulations through the FERC.   When Trump took office in 2016 gas was hovering around $3.50 a gallon, by 2017-2018 it was down about 30%.  Barrel of oil was about $75.00 and went down well below $50 barrel.  So are you saying there is no correlation?  I think what you are missing is how much power the federal government has on the economy through all the various regulating agencies which ultimately comes to the power of the presidency.  To drill for oil you need permits and licenses.  Since Biden has been in office barrel of oil has gone from $65 to $120.  Some predict that it will go to $150 before years end and average price for a gallon of gas will be over $5.00.  It's almost there now.

As for energy independence, that just means in simple terms we don't import oil because we produce enough domestically.

"Ok, I will try to explain.  1st, look at the correlation between US crude oil price and the inauguration of Joe Biden.  There is no coincidence there.  To appease far left Democratic base Joe Biden signed (his first weeks in office) a multitude of executive orders in aim to decrease oil production in the US, raise the price of gas as to encourage people to switch to electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions.  Cancelling the pipe line was just one thing he did.   He also signed orders to limit to fracking and limit drilling rights controlled by the federal government.   In terms of oil production in the US the federal government has a heavy hand.  That is how executive orders and the president play a huge part of the production capacity.   Otherwise, it's just supply and demand.  Biden is on the side of supply, lower supply as the demand stays the same or increases and the price has no choice as to go up.  The increase in gas prices is intentional.   This is what people on the left want.

"Here‚Äôs my beef:

Joe Biden is going to take all the credit for things going well. Unemployment is crazy low right now. But that low employment is largely due to the easing of the pandemic and people going back to work. It‚Äôs about where it was before the pandemic. I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden has done anything to ease the pandemic or unemployment except to be in the right place at the right time. 

Low unemployment is what is driving up wages, but it‚Äôs also driving up inflation. If Joe Biden gets credit for the unemployment situation, then he should get blamed for the inflation, even though he‚Äôs just the guy in the office at the time!

Gas prices are similarly being affected by the easing of the pandemic. Prices bottomed out when people stopped driving. They‚Äôre mostly a little higher right now than they were before. That additional increase is largely attributed to inflation, which we‚Äôve already addressed. 

Low unemployment, rising wages, and high inflation have been 20 years in the making. Ever sense the .com bubble burst in the early 00s, we‚Äôve had decreasing interest rates and loose fiscal policy. The .com burst was just starting to recover when the 08 mortgage crisis happened and we were just starting to recover from that when the pandemic happened. 

Long story short, if you keep pouring on the gasoline, eventually you‚Äôll find a spark and a raging fire. 

I don‚Äôt think the current administration is directly responsible for gas prices. It certainly hasn‚Äôt done anything that might have helped them. But if it‚Äôs going to take credit for the positive - it is, then it has to take credit for the blame, too. 

This stuff is all the same, credit and blame, regardless of which party is in power. Everyone wants the credit for the good and wants to shift the blame for the bad.

"So do you think the mob boss is innocent when he tells his hitmen to murder people or do illicit activities? Come on man. You can try to play that card for your base and that may get them clapping and cheering. But the country knows better judging by their overwhelming dissaproval for how the biden administration handled covid. Having something in a press release is vastly different from their day to day rhetoric and action.  

And for your links.  When was that version of revisionist doctrine updated or posted? Lol. It's talking about their plan for fighting covid then right after it is talking about how good they did with vaccine distribution. It reads like they're mashing together 10 press releases and trying to pass it off as a paper. Not to mention it jumping around on timelines is incredibly alarming. It's like a rough draft of a rough draft of a rough draft before you try to splice together a midterm paper.

The earliest evidence you can have or need is faucci saying masks don't work and 15 days to stop the spread.  Full stop. If fauccis own words(the Biden Administration)were followed supply chains wouldn't have been affected by the over reaching policies and inflation (though will always be a thing to some extent) would not have taken off like it has over the past year.

One of his biggest detriments was the fight for vaccine. Firing employees or suspending them or barring them from work because they wouldn't get a brand new ""vaccine"" is another key in the supply chain and inflation crisis.  Hard to get supplies places when a substantial portion of the workers were fired or laid off. Hell,  even hard to get some food at your local restaurant when half the staff got fired due to vaccine requirements pushed by the biden administration.",t2_i6ppds8y,kaigh-Sea,0,1648883568.0,0,t1_i330909,i330909,False,Caleb_F__,t3_tua183,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/tua183/a_question_for_folks_on_the_right/,A question for folks on the right.,/r/missouri/comments/tua183/a_question_for_folks_on_the_right/i330909/,1,r/missouri,0,1

All of this is signaling to the oil companies that oil is near the end of its dominate life cycle. This is making them resistant to pushing to drill new wells like they were before the pandemic. Why would they invest that kind of money to watch it not have a good return they are getting now. The oil companies are in the get all they can mode while they can.

"Though the president doesn't directly have a finger on the gas/oil switch (any president). Meaning theyre never really entirely responsible for the pricing, but they can certainly sway the market to trend up or down. 

I believe there is one or 2 things he is most certainly to blame for the price hike. His whole campaign and since he has been in office he has created mass hesitancy within the market through his rhetoric as well as actions he has taken. This has the potential for being the most dangerous of them all as well. And anyone that is familiar with market finance knows hesitancy within any market can be wildly unpredictable depending on the circumstances.

Another statistical fact, unless you're fat or elderly you have nothing to fear from Covid if you're vaccinated or have access to the Pfizer pill. Omnicron was the weakest variant yet, disproving what you stated above.

Both Kansas(democrat) and Missouri(republican governors said its over, will be treated like the flu. It's done, get used to it, no one is going along with the stupid bullshit anymore, especially not in an election year. 

I had that shit 3 times, 2 times before vaccines were even out because of the nature of my business, no choice, had to work, never knew I had it. Vaxxed and had Omni it was nothing either, slight head cold.

History will judge a lot of this, and a lot of the idiotic measures taken won't age well. Give it time.... Covid is now over, it's the flu and nothing more, deal with it or move to some liberal shithole where you can cower in fear and feign moral superiority. Not happening here.

"St. Louis has a lot of good restaurants but if you want local cuisine then that means: toasted ravioli (especially from a mom and pop Italian restaurant in The Hill neighborhood), Imo‚Äôs Pizza (or other St. Louis style pizza), Gooey Butter Cake (try Russell‚Äôs), and Ted Drewes frozen custard. Also barbecue (St. Louis style ribs or BBQ pork steak). This is probably heresy (as someone who lives here) but I prefer Kansas City BBQ. 

Things also recommended which I haven‚Äôt tried: local fish fry at one of the Catholic Churches (it‚Äôs Lent y‚Äôall), Slingers (drunk night diner food, fancier version at Roosters), or a St. Paul Sandwich (most local Chinese restaurants (ex. Hon's Wok in Central West End).

If, by twist of fate, you head south to where my mothers family is from - there exists the cultural masterpiece that is Lamberts, home of the fresh throwed rolls.

You‚Äôll wait like an hour to be seated at dinner time and then order. While you wait, the sides get brought to you in and endless parade by the good folks of Lamberts but fear not friend, for the roll man cometh and he will throw a piping hot roll the size of your face at you with the arms of Apollo.

"This is super false. Lots of articles debunk the myth that variants get weaker over time. Here is one:  https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-011488089270

Regardless, if you understand how variants work, they are mutations that result in a strain significantly different enough that they can outcompete the current dominant strain(s). That can mean more contagious, or more able to evade the immune system or vaccines.  Or it can mean a combination of a variety of things, some of which are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù for us (less severe symptoms) or not. 

The thing is, mutations are random, but the more replication of the virus, the more mutations, and the greater the chance of a variant emerging.
