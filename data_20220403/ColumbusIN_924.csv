"I would advise against Williamsburg Apartments They kept my deposit, despite having no reason to do so. I had to sue to get it back. Even after I won, they still didn't pay until the judge issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the apartments.  In the case, it sure looked like nobody ever got a deposit back. It was the standard policy to keep it cuz most people won't go through the hassle of suing.

Also, once the dumpsters were overflowing cuz they hadn't paid the trash guys.

Also once we had two feet of snow that never got plowed cuz they didn't pay the snowplow guys.

Also the structure of the carport was rotten and on the verge of structural collapse.

Also their maintenance guys were cleaning out an apartment and intentionally threw a big mirror from the top balcony instead of carrying it down, so there was broken glass everywhere, forever.

Also a guy I knew had his apartment flood cuz defective plumbing and he lost everything he owned. The apartment paid nothing.

Joe willies is a good restaurant to start and not a crowded bar. The Columbus bar still closes early, but it’s not a crowded bar so you can actually enjoy each others company. Henry social club is doing reservations but it’s as close to fine dinning as you’ll get. If it’s a day date, fresh take is quick, quality, and light.

Each of these are great locally owned.

"""downtown"" is pretty small (grant it, the town is only about 45k folks) though it is nice. Has that small town feeling with a large emphasis architecture. Too bad you will be missing the end of farmers market season, but there should be some festivals upcoming you can check out. We had a juneteenth and Chinese expo earlier in the summer, and I believe we have a Hispanic and Indian expos upcoming. Mill race park is very nice downtown along the river. The churches are also a large part of the architecture, (there is a free self tour app for all of the main stops for your phone if you want to check out some history)

Not too much nightlife, but there are some fairly active groups for various activities, if not here, you aren't far from Bloomington or indy. Overall, considering it's a fairly blue collar town, decent diversity and services for a town this size in the middle of Indiana. PM me if you have questions or need info.

"Welcome! There is a decent ""small town"" flavor here, without it being totally hostile to change. The city gov seems to have a decent handle on providing the community with services that are unusual for a town this size (I've lived in Michigan, Cali, Hawaii, and TN in my military days) market is getting very warm because of work from home options but the starter homes are reasonably priced. There are a handful of bums, but the police presence is fairly high traffic so that keeps most of the dozen or so of them from bothering most in town. My wife and I don't have kids, but the school system is better than average for the state. If you are religious, the church scene is alive and active, if not, there are some really cool buildings around (I'm an atheist but I do enjoy historical buildings) the farmers market is very active  and has alot of draw, which is very pleasant to see. There isn't much nightlife, but the restaurant scene is better than most Midwest towns of this size (variety-wise) so you can get a very decent NYC slice from Carlos, very authentic tacos from El recon, Ramen from ramen alley, or healthy options like fresh take. Brewery scene isn't bad either, hog Mollys, 450N, and Zwanzigz. Public transportation is better than most (people trails and ColomBUS) which is nice, but not perfect.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

Check out Squarespace. It's essentially a drag and drop website builder, we suggest it for all our clients who don't want to pay $$$ for us to build them a Wordpress site.

Also, I'm sure you know this, but websites do cost money. We pay for our domain every three years, and we pay monthly for hosting. Squarespace lets you package that all together, but if you go another route, you'll have to buy your domain and decide where you want your site to be hosted.

Honestly, for now, I'd just start a Facebook page and direct people there.

[Don’t Be Gullible: Being Aware of Genealogical Fraud (Part One)](https://blog.ancestorcloud.com/2017/01/26/dont-be-gullible-being-aware-of-genealogical-fraud-part-one/)

> In 2012 news broke of an identity theft ring operating through a paid subscriber to Ancestry.com. The woman was mining information from birth records and the Social Security database, primarily selling them for the purpose of filing fraudulent tax returns. Changes were made and now only Social Security numbers of persons who have been deceased ten years or more are accessible on the site.

This scammer also creates [fly-by-night websites](https://www.heritagehuntersgenealogy.com/) that they link to for you to give them personal identifiable information and payment details. Stay away from www.heritagehuntersgenealogy.com or whatever else it ends up getting changed to in the future.

"I’ve tried various amplified antennas and get next to nothing, and I’m on the northeast corner of Columbus proper.

If you have an AppleTV, Roku, or similar, there’s a non-profit called Locast.org that rebroadcasts OTA broadcasts over the Internet. You can use it for free, but the ad breaks asking for donations were enough to get me to donate $4/month. Columbus gets all the Indianapolis stations and all the digital .x substations.

It’s been fantastic, especially since AT&T gets into pissing matches with those stations so frequently and drops them.

"We lived in Cole for close to two years and left around a year ago. During the time that we were there, we never had the issue where we can hear our neighbors. You WILL hear the upstair unit though especially if they have such a heavy foot. The trains are loud but there will come a time where you will get immune to the sound and won’t even notice them. I used to wake up in the middle of the night because of the train but I got used to it quickly, even our little kids got used to the train.

The good thing about Cole is that it is close to almost everything. It’s close to the park as well if you want to do a quick run or jog. Parking is very convenient especially during winter.

The only thing that I don’t like about Cole is when it’s time to renew your lease. They will try to bump up the price considerably higher than new leases. Up until today, I don’t have any idea on why they do that. We could have stayed there for quite a few more years if they’ve been more reasonable with the cost.

"I think their biggest draw is that they release new stuff very often, like every 3-6 weeks. 

And it's not worth it. We used to go the weekend after a release to get flights of the new stuff to try. The slushys all pretty much taste the same, and the IPAs are all very similar as well.  Between that and food issues with their new building, we quit going. I think we've been once or twice this year, we used to go like twice a month.

Gotta hand it to them though, they found a business model that works, and they're making a killing with it. I did the math last year, based on the number of cases they had available and the typical industry markup, they were bringing in a few hundred thousand in just profit from each release.

"You've recently started working near Seymour, but considering Columbus as a housing option; I'm betting you've joined at one of our many fine factories. Welcome.

Our internet is pretty cheap and I definitely don't have complaints in town. Frequently downloading hour long shows in 4-5 minutes and running 30 pings when I play video games.

A note about Columbus.

Columbus is a largely corporate town centered on Cummins, historically. The company has brought world renown art and architecture; but more importantly, has diversified our manufacturing capability and employment opportunities. We're firmly in the rust belt, but we haven't rusted. This has allowed us to grow and diversify culturally.

Columbus has a thriving downtown with several bars and restaurants. We have fantastic public parks and people's trail. We have festivals and expos. We are a thriving small town in the midwest that many of us are proud of. We're small, but we have great opportunities. Its a good place to build your picket fence, buy a dog, and live the American Dream; because, honestly, we're a town where the middle class can thrive.

One of our most famous sons is Vice President Pence, a figure known as a loyal Republican and staunch social conservative. As governor, Pence's anti-LGBT rhetoric and legislation forced several companies to consider leaving the state or revising their plans within it, this included Cummins. Pence's bigotry nearly destroyed his home town. Thankfully, Cummins is still here and frequently flies a rainbow at its corporate headquarters.

I love my town, and I'm always willing to entice others into joining our community. So I went through posts to see if I could speak about any specific things that Columbus has to offer. Please take residence in Seymour. Our community doesn't need anyone that posts so frequently on the\_donald, I don't think you'd make a good addition to the town. 

But yeah, our internet is pretty fantastic. You could live here for under $1000 a month, in a decent neighborhood. Also its imperative to have an auto in Columbus or Seymour, our public transportation isn't adequate.",t2_1ugsp80s,TheAntiColumbusMan,0,1532460644.0,0,t1_e2yogo3,e2yogo3,True,DownvotesCatposts,t3_91a51n,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbusIN/comments/91a51n/considering_a_move_to_this_area/,Considering a move to this area,/r/columbusIN/comments/91a51n/considering_a_move_to_this_area/e2yogo3/,4,r/columbusIN,0,4

"15 year resident, two kids of similar ages. Most of your questions have already been answered but I'll add that city property taxes apply everywhere within city limits. If you live outside the city but within the county your taxes will likely be lower. There are no separate property taxes, it all funnels via the one main tax. The state has a max property tax of 1% accessed value on residential property, subject to some caveats.

There is a 1.25% income tax in the county. 

Only point i would bring up is west of town (Tipton lakes) is across a railroad from the main part of town. When a train comes through it cuts things in half. Many people who live west are annoyed as the trains come through during morning or evening commutes once a week or so.  Just food for thought.

"If you are planning to work in Columbus, I would recommend living in/close to town. Bloomington and Indianapolis are great to visit, but not ideal for a daily commute. 

Students in town can choose which HS they want to attend, so when relocating you are basically just choosing an elementary school. There are a lot of good options, but Southside and Parkside are generally considered the best. 

The entire town is very safe. Tipton Lakes is a really nice cluster of developments just West of 65; it's a great area for kids and feeds into Southside elementary. I would definitely at least drive through there and check it out. The HOA has some general info on their website as well. 

Really the entire school system in Bartholomew county is pretty highly regarded. We have had a very positive experience so far. I'm not sure if you will need daycare; Cummins partners with a private service provider to run their own daycare facility (CCDC) and it's excellent. Non Cummins employees can enroll their kids there as well. 

The entire state of Indiana caps property tax at 1% of a homes assessed value. 

Hopefully that helps a little. We haven't been here that long yet, but our initial experience has been that it's a great place to raise a family.

"Congratulations!  Columbus is awesome.  Let me take a stab at some of these.

* I really like Columbus, and for families, it's outstanding.  The next closest areas you'd probably want to live are Greenwood, which is such a commuter town, or Bloomington, more of a college town.  I'd really recommend Columbus, though (not that I'm biased).
* The north side of town (around Parkside and Columbus North) as well as the Tipton Lakes area are the best for top safety and schools.  We lived by Parkside for five years and have now lived downtown in a renovated historic home for almost a year, and have had no crime issues in either place.  Our Parkside house was statistically the lowest-crime area of the entire city, we actually never locked our front door there.
* Can't really answer this one, as I have no kids and didn't grow up here, but Parkside is top in the school system for grade schools, and Columbus North is top for high schools.
* The only tax I can think of that Barthlomew doesn't have and most other counties do is the Wheel Tax.
* I moved here from Illinois and have been continually impressed with how low property taxes are here - and when I lived in the Parkside district, I was told mine were high.  We do not pay a separate tax for schools, it comes out of property taxes.  
* Yes, in 2008 this area experienced massive flooding, a 500 year flood.  In Columbus, avoid any properties that were ""totally renovated"" in 2008, specifically anything along Haw Creek (runs through the center of town) and The Lagoons (lakes just off of Washington Street).  Many properties in those areas were not only totally underwater and redone, they now also have flood insurance requirements.
* I really can't speak to the reputations of other cities schools.  I was told Parkside was the 6th best elementary school in the state when I moved here, and people would move their families to Columbus just to send their kids there.  I have no sources for that besides my husband, who grew up here.

- There's a shortage of pool tables in town, though those take up so much space.

- Being up north, it's probably a good idea to attract cyclists as well. Bike parking, maybe host a couple of social rides.
- Pets allowed on that patio? A dog-friendly place will draw a certain crowd. I think it's a big reason about 1/3 of people at the Farmer's Market go.

">but the most publicised fireworks in town are treated with less preparation than going to Becker's? It makes no sense to me.

I'm not really sure where you're getting that idea from. I mean people don't camp out because its generally a 10-15 minute fire work display. Its not like Columbus has the resources of a Louisville or a Cincinnati to put on an equal show.

They start working on them at like 7:00 am the day off, setting up all of the actual fire works. After that's set up they take the entire parking lot from IVY tech end all the way down to the learning center end and jam it full of food booths, bounce castles, face paintings, etc.


I'd say there is tons of preperation put into the fireworks, tons of turn out. Its just not a ""party"" like say the Indy 500.

"This summer may be a critical period for East Columbus. The INDOT project is big, but now the Irwin Union Bank building appears to be selling after West owning it for only a couple years. What happens to that building can be a weathervane for development in that area. It could be a local business that will use the building with some remodeling or it could be torn down to put in retail or fast food. 

I really hope that the building stays around. It's one of my favorites. I'd buy it in a heartbeat if I had the money to spend. Across State is [Irwin Union's original State Street branch building](, http://52weeks.rickyberkey.org/2012/01/13/week_1/) now a flower shop. It was designed by Harry Weese but was out grown. The shopping plaza next to it was either a Weese design or he specified design elements to match. They aren't the most attractive buildings, but like the Post Office or The Republic, they become interesting with some historical details and context. 

For this particular intersection, context is key. You have the Weese building(s), designed in the 50s, maybe early 60s. The Paul Kennon structure was an attempt to jumpstart redevelopment in the 70s because of the expansion of manufacturing in the corridor and prevalence of drive-thru banking. This was joined by the county occupying the adjacent school as the Annex building. Now, the new County Annex is being designed by Julie Snow of Snow Kreilich in Minneapolis. It is sure to be another masterpiece and sure to be talked about as a key to redeveloping the corridor. Losing the Kennon building would be a loss for the city.

Paul Kennon designed 2 other buildings in town, Fodrea School and the AT&T Switching Station at 7th & Franklin. He also was the architect for the Washington streetscape, the brick intersections, the sidewalks, and the planters. That was completed in 1990, after his death in January. He was involved in the Front Door Project, Mill Race Park, and had designed a new golf course for the west side that was never built. His son, Kevin Kennon, designed The Learning Center. I think that had Paul Kennon not died so young, we would have five or six more buildings of his in town. He was genuinely liked by the community. He was known for valuing public input and still designing edgy buildings. Kevin Kennon has talked about how working with his father in Columbus was why he decided to follow in his footsteps.

Sorry this is so long. I just really hope this building survives the newest plan.",t2_a38x2,Bjorn74,0,1429445404.0,0,t1_cqhdww3,cqhdww3,True,Bjorn74,t3_2zv92s,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbusIN/comments/2zv92s/what_should_go_in_a_new_east_columbus/,What should go in a new East Columbus?,/r/columbusIN/comments/2zv92s/what_should_go_in_a_new_east_columbus/cqhdww3/,1,r/columbusIN,0,1
"Columbus has a horrible housing market. There is more demand than physical places to rent or buy and this creates an inflated market. [Columbus has on average the second highest rent rates in Indiana]( http://www.indystar.com/story/money/2014/12/31/indiana-cities-highest-apartment-rents/21114583/). I can tell you you will not find anywhere in the city for less than $600/month. The crappier apartments start at about $650-700 per month with the more upscale apartment go about for $1000-1500/month. Usually prices do not include utilities here, those are normally extra. Sometimes you can get a group deal on internet or cable through an apartment complex. 

Renting here is very expensive, if you plan on staying in the area for a couple years it is often cheaper per month to buy a house, plus you can get some or all of that money back if you sell it. 

That said, the apartment complexes are pretty well advertised. Decide on a budget and go from there. There are some newer places over by east high school. And the nicer but expensive apartments are by Tipton lakes out on highway 46. 

Some cheaper apartments are out by taylorsville, and depending on where you work might be 20 minutes to work.

"Some thoughts..

**Make it inviting for people**

- Don't pave the whole area with parking lots and put in crappy one-stop destinations. In other words, make it the antithesis of 46. All of 46 (between the highway and town) looks like a truck stop, there are car accidents all the time, nobody walks between the stores and restaurants, I don't think I've ever seen a pedestrian try to cross it, and even the folks running or riding bikes on the people trail don't stop on on 46 if they can help it. There's pavement and gas stations everywhere and it looks really uninviting. 
- A bar.. but not like CB. Do something different! Put in a beer garden, or at least have a large outdoor area. Nothing in Cbus has a big area outside. Put a few cornhole sets out back and pump some music out there, and the people will flock to the place.
- Grocery store.. but not a huge one. Maybe a bodega. Huge venues don't bring people to an area beyond use of that venue. The corner of 10th and 31 isn't a destination teeming with culture and a cosmopolitan atmosphere despite having a superwalmart and a lowes.  
-Make the pedestrian-busy areas of the street super well-lit. No one wants to walk around in the dark, especially given State Street's current reputation.
- Calm the traffic down for everyone's sake. Who's gonna want to slow down and pull over at that grocery store on the way home if the guy riding their bumper might rear-end them while trying to text a clever reply at 50 miles per hour? Also, no one wants to converse over the noise of trucks barreling down the road or choke on fumes in between sips of beer. I don't think Pacheco's Winery was helped by the Cummins test trucks rumbling down everyone's favorite 3-lane highway running through downtown.
- Make the streets easy to cross. I usually call my family to tell them I love them and how I'd like my belongings distributed before attempting to cross State Street.

Columbus seems to be a place that depends or depended on a core of people and institutions to make things happen.

Truly, the truth is that anywhere you go, life is what you make of it. Columbus provides ample opportunities and resources to do just about anything.

"Places to go.. 

* Bloomington, Indy, Louisville, Cincinnati
    - Bloomington - brunch, cool bars (though the very best ones are not in obvious places), good cheap food, live music, farmers market, young people, cute shops for books/music/gifts
    - Indy - bars, shopping malls, sporting events, the IMA, good pedestrian/cycling paths in downtown and Mass Ave.
    - Louisville - ""first fridays trolley hop"", ""flea off market"", Market street = best bars, Bardstown Road = hipster bars, 4th street = amateur hour
    - Cincinnati - Rhinegeist, Neons, other cool bars, IKEA, something other than Indy, Btown, or Louisville

As for Columbus, I'd bring a bicycle with you or get one. There are a bunch of casual and social rides that happen every month. It's a nice way to meet people and make friends (and save a little $). Town is small so you can get around most places that way and you can't beat the parking. *Oh and take that bike with you to Brown County.* Excuses to be outside are a good thing and Brown County is one of the best. Nature, trails, picnics, whatever.

Someone mentioned first fridays at Powerhouse.. that's a very good idea. 450 North is a very good idea. Bars on 4th aren't amazing but they'll get you by, bars that begin with Z are ok too (Zwanzigs, Ziggie's). 

Obviously the best recommendations will depend on what you're into, but you shouldn't have too much trouble finding your own flavor of activities here. If you get here and you find yourself looking for something in particular without success, just ask. Some of the best things in Columbus are not that easy to find. 

Good luck.

Biking and running are popular on the People Trails, and there are many races and rides on the weekends. There are a handful of different bike riding groups, too. The popularity of bikes in town is in part due to the fact that the town is mostly flat (no hills until you go west of town!), and because some things are so close that it's ridiculous to drive a mile.

"Housing is a pain for interns because most landlords and apartments do not want to do a short-term lease.

As a result, your company will have some available homestay-type situations - they send out an email to everyone in the company asking if anyone has a spare bedroom and would like to host an intern. I know a couple who have had a variety of interns stay with them. You pay rent, but it's a short-term situation, etc. It's a good way to get to know the town, too, because you have people you can ask about all the other things. Maybe they'll even take you out and include you when they go out with friends.

CB is awesome. Zwanzigz definitely has great pizza and beer. There are a variety of craft breweries around town, too.

Columbus is super-bike friendly in the summertime. Walking is a bit more difficult because sidewalks are nonexistent in places you'd think they would be. Most everything is bikeable, within a few miles. Try to bring a bike or pick one up or borrow one when you get to town.

"On the apartments, with your price range, you shouldn't have a problem finding something within a mile or two of downtown but it's probably going to be closer to $700, and it's probably not going to have a pool/gym. I'm not 100% on the apartment situation though because every apartment I've had has been in Bloomington, so don't quote me on it, but I'm pretty certain of this.  All I know is Columbus apartments are overpriced.  They're like the same as Bloomington prices but without the benefit of living in Bloomington. And don't get me wrong, Columbus is a very nice town, it's just not as ""happening"" as Bloomington, which, you'll have that with it not being a major college town.  

If you rent something a little further from downtown obviously the price is going to drop and my buddies said there are definitely apartments with pools/gyms but they can't think of the name right now.  Google is probably your best friend on that.  Also I have a couple friends that rent downtown and I can ask them about it.

Something you may want to consider (which I don't know how opposed to it you would be) is renting a house, possibly with a roommate.  And when I say house I mean basically an apartment, where someone has turned a house into 2-3 different apartments, but they're everywhere in town. That's what most people I know rent.  There are several gyms, big and small, all over town.  I feel like every time I go driving around I see a new one haha.



Now onto the bars (my field of expertise), my favorite *by far* is the ""CB"" (Columbus Bar).  It's on 4th street by the 4th and Washington intersection.  It's a very relaxed environment, but not relaxed in a boring way at all. They have 4 smaller TV's that are usually turned to some sporting event, which is fine with me because that's all I really want to watch at a bar.  Their food is pretty damn good as well, I'm not sure if they still have it, but they used to have chicken fried bacon, which is as good as it sounds.  Sunday nights they have local music and it's always free to go watch, and usually filled with what is honestly some pretty good music.  They also brew their own beer, I'm not sure how into beer you are but the name is Powerhouse Brewery if you want to look it up. They're pretty solid.

There's another bar on 4th street about two blocks down from the CB that is literally called ""4th Street"".  It's pretty alright, I've been there a handful of times and never had a bad time whatsoever, I'd just rather go to the CB because that's where all my friends go.

There's a place right across the street from the CB although it's technically on Washington called Jordy's.  It's like an ""Irish"" pub & grill type thing. It's more of a restaurant than a bar, but I still like it. I know a few people that work there and they have a lot of large TV's so I like to go there to watch sporting events or if someone I know is working.  Sitting at the bar there is a pretty good environment, good food, and they have cheap prices on (cheap) beer.  You can get a 16oz PBR for like $1.50, and a 32oz for $2.75 any night of the week.

On to Zwanzigz.  It's a pizzeria/brewery located at 11th & Lafayette, not *too* far from downtown but a little more away from everything.  BUT, it's goddamn amazing.  Their pizza will make you cream yourself and their beer is awesome.  Their head brewer has won several gold/silver cups for his brewing and is just an awesome guy. He'll sit at the bar with you and discuss his beers and give you free samples. Super cool dude.

There are more smaller restaurant&bar type deals but those are the main ones if you're looking for some social interaction.

And now the last thing I'll say before ending this novel, **STAY AWAY FROM THE BAR CALLED ""SCORES""** It's on the west side of town anyway, you'd have to drive there and cops looove to hang out on 46 (the highway that runs through town, the bar is on this road) in parking lots and pull-over anyone leaving that bar or really just anyone driving on 46 late at night.  Not even *close* to walking distance, annnd it's the worst bar in the world. It's trying to be a ""dance club"" but it's just the trashiest shit ever. It's like some mediocre bro-type bar where you can experience some wannabe frat boys *AND* get a gun pulled on you all in one night! I mean you might be into that shit, I have no idea haha.

But yeah,  I'm sure there are some spelling errors and stuff throughout, if something doesn't make sense, ask me and I'll try to clarify it.

"Downtown Columbus has a number of great places to eat and communicate with your date. Puccini's in the Commons Mall is relaxed and casual without being boring and can invite conversation.

Afterwards, hit up the Yes Cinema for a unique movie/play/documentary or other viewing experience. Sometimes the Commons will have an event or you can hit a couple of the goofy shops downtown. Other restaurants worth considering downtown are Tri Bicheri (reservations needed), Smith's Row (reservations), and Zharako's (sp?).  The later is also an excellent and fun dessert option.

"The Columbus Bar and 4th Street Bar are classics. There are also a few newer bars such as The Garage and Jordy McTaggart's.
