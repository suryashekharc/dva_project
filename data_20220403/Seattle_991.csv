"This is the correct answer. And to add on, it was not a strike--it was a one-day informational picket by pilots on their day off and irrelevant to Alaska canceling flights.

"You are flat out wrong.

Every one of those pilots was all over TV.

It is *illegal* to call out sick to picket.    They would be fired instantly had they done so.   You don't get to be an airline pilot if you're so stupid that you put yourself on TV breaking Federal Labor Laws.

It's weird how y'all can't accept basic reality.

10 hour wait times for customer service operators.....That because of the picket?

Hundreds of flights cancelled yesterday and today.   That because of a 2 hour picket two days ago?   Hundreds of flights are going to  be cancelled all summer long.......That because of a 2 hour picket in April?

Or......perhaps the reality is that the Company is woefully understaffed because pilots are quitting left and right and new hires don't show up to class because they can walk across the street to Delta and end up flying widebodies for **$73k more per year** than they could ever make at Alaska??

"> There’s no such thing as ‘gun trafficking’ between states and nor should there be.

Can you please clarify what you mean by this? So you're okay with illegally obtained firearms moving between states and think that's okay and not gun trafficking? What about when a sale from a vendor occurs in a state, then a private sale with no background check laws occurs, and that weapon is brought here then used/sold? Is that not gun trafficking since the owner of the weapon never went through the proper background checks required in this state?

I don't understand how you can say that gun trafficking between states doesn't exist. Illegally acquired or weapons purchased without background checks via private sales are 100% being moved in to the state. If that isn't the case and every weapon acquired here is going through background checks how do criminals keep acquiring guns in this state? They have to come from somewhere.

> You admit we don’t enforce the current laws well enough and yet ask for more to be implemented. If we can’t enforce what we already have what leads you to believe that these new laws will be enforced any better?

I said they MAY not do a good enough job enforcing the laws and asked for data on this if it exists. We don't enforce the current laws well enough because those laws don't exist in all 50 states or at the federal level for private sales. How are you not seeing this process of not requiring background checks for private sales in all states as a problematic loophole?

> So local and federal background checks, minimum wait times, waiving of your medical records and required training for any SAF (semi-auto rifle) is still not enough?

No it's not enough. Again, for **private sales** not all states require background checks which is a huge problem. This should be changed at the federal level and not left up to the states to decide. If you want to buy a gun from anyone in any state you should have to go through a background check. Outside of that the minimum wait time is barely an inconvenience, the medical record process isn't thorough enough in terms of what counts as an exclusion, and only requiring training for semi-automatic rifles makes no sense. If you want to buy any gun you should be required to go through weapons training and testing, full stop.

I said it above and I'll say it again, it takes more work to get a driver's license than a gun and that's a problem.",t2_5nzd6,LinFTW,0,1649008166.0,0,t1_i38yfcu,i38yfcu,False,kappakid42,t3_tuwidf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tuwidf/man_killed_in_pioneer_square_shooting/,Man killed in Pioneer Square shooting,/r/Seattle/comments/tuwidf/man_killed_in_pioneer_square_shooting/i38yfcu/,1,r/Seattle,0,1

"40-50% still wear masks. During the active law it was up to 70% and the other 30% were generally dicks about it. 

I'd say 15% were honest medical exceptions the rest were being dicks about it. Sorry but asthma really doesn't disqualify you. Bitching about how it's difficult to wear one doesn't disqualify you. Religion doesn't disqualify you but the sad part is people found a way. Every sunday church services made covid counts heavily increase. I haven't been to church since 2019 because they always felt exempt and were only contributing to the spread of covid. I have tried to hire a few service venders to fix things in my home but due to no mask I turned them away and asked company for my money back. Home is different than businesses. Business can't do diddily shit if someone refuses to wear a mask. Now small ma and pa operated business might be able to. My hair salon is very serious about masks. Government buildings it's still a requirement. Airports it's still a requirement.

Even now I'd still recommend a mask.

Please stop asking employees to take them off it is inappropriate.

I noticed people got more serious about wearing them after law was optional. There's a small percentage that were asses about the whole thing all of a sudden started wearing them. I think they might of had an ""oh, shit this is real"" sort of movement. I'd still suggest to wear one while inside shopping centers that do not have good air flow or in crowds where you're shoulder to shoulder.",t2_jlcw0r55,Easy-Instruction-875,0,1649004875.0,0,t1_i38qdf1,i38qdf1,True,torodonn,t3_tv2u5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tv2u5c/how_is_mask_usage_looking_in_seattle_these_days/,How is mask usage looking in Seattle these days?,/r/Seattle/comments/tv2u5c/how_is_mask_usage_looking_in_seattle_these_days/i38qdf1/,1,r/Seattle,0,1
"*""Is it difficult to find a job in the industry because of that? ""*

No it's stupid easy.  We hired people that were obviously drug addicts, but not so bad they weren't presentable, back in 2016.  And still couldn't fill up all the positions we needed.  At a fine dining restaurant that made a lot of money, not just some random place.  It's just like restaurants anywhere else: have a pulse, don't be high at the interview, get a job.

I used to work in restaurants too where you make $2.13/ hour + tips back where I moved here from.  When I found out that tipped positions in Seattle make the minimum wage, which was then $15, now $17.29, I couldn't believe it either.  hahaha.  It was like finding an arbitrage opportunity.

I actually had a college degree and multiple years of work experience in corporate finance.  I worked in restaurants in Seattle not because I had to, but because they paid more than even that, the job was easier, and you work with young hot women and fun people and stuff instead of 50 year old obese zombies that sold their souls and just gave up on life.  And yeah the odd 50 year old that didn't turn into a zombie too, good fun interesting people.  Also it has a flexible schedule, so you can take time off whenever you want it, or whatever.

"Oh God no, why would you even think that is remotely realistic or that a reasonable person would think it's a good idea? 

No, the horse is out of the barn on this issue, and frankly we are better for it. Forcing women back to the home won't solve this or any other problem. No my view is that the economic consequences of women entering the workforce in such a short period of time (upward inflationary pressure) are simply the cost of that liberty. The end of slavery had negative economic consequences for the slave owners and the economy, but the moral imperative to do away with such an unjust system was clearly more important.

Perhaps this is the nuance that you are not grasping in this discussion. It's possible to look at certain events and objectively assess their economic impact without having to pass a judgement or assign blame.

"Any tipped job is lucrative.  Tipped jobs in Seattle have to pay the minimum wage + tips.  So not $2.13/h + tips like in most states.  But $17.27/ hr + tips.  I used to make $35 an hour bussing tables.  The bartender was making much more than that.  Servers were making somewhere in between.

I paid the same amount for rent ($1000) and supported myself bussing tables part time.  Not just supporting, I saved up +$1K in my account each month.  Like $10K a year.  So bartending should be easy.

Any front of house restaurant work beats any other unskilled job or even high skilled labor job in the city in terms of how easy it is and pay.  You'll be making 4-5 times the amount of people doing hard labor or even more than people in skilled trades.

Front of house restaurant work in Seattle is like a cheat code.

Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:

Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""

"> Right, we've absolutely failed nationally to create enough housing stock. This is actually uncontroversial.

And the fix here is not to create hellscapes like Manhattan but promote decentralization. We're already seeing the start of this, the population of the King County has decreased in 2020.

> The cumulative increase over the previous decade in housing in King County as of 2019 was 14%. That's pretty goddamn atrocious compared to the pop growth.

King County has plenty of cities with good people who don't want their neighborhoods to be bumfucked by greedy developers. So that's why Seattle's numbers are so stunning. 20% growth within 10 years for a large city _is_ huge.

Incidentally London has massively more cameras than any US city too. Kids know where those are located though and exactly how to defeat them. Very professional.

 Apropos of nothing re law and order: In London 99.9% of the time nobody is going to shoot you after you stab them - including most cops. Almost zero handguns there. I think that might be part of the logic at play in the differential. 
 Brits regularly punch strangers on Friday nights but in comparison that is a far less common sight in American cities.

No matter.

It's clear you have no interest in basic common sense or reality.

Just threw away years of study and dedication......threw away *their entire careers* to stand on the side of the street for two hours.  Sure.

"FYI - take note about the landlord requirements with the new law. Really read each piece of it because if the landlord doesn't do it all then you have a case against what they're doing, and can contest it.

[https://www.rhawa.org/blog/how-to-increase-rent-in-seattle##](https://www.rhawa.org/blog/how-to-increase-rent-in-seattle##)

Here are a few important ones:

>If the increase is for 10% or more over the lowest rate in the past 12 months, the notice of increase must either be delivered to each adult at the unit by either hand-delivery or mailing both by certified mail with return receipt and by regular US mail. The notice must also include a packet about the new economic displacement relocation assistance program. This packet has not yet been developed by SDCI, but should be available sometime in the next six months.

* Any rent increase in Seattle now requires that the housing provider give 180 days’ notice of the increase
* if the increase is for 10% or more, you must follow the extra delivery requirements.
* between 60 and 90 days before the current term ends, you must serve either a notice offering the new rental agreement or a notice of which just cause you are using to refuse to renew the tenancy.
* The resident must be allowed a minimum of 30 days to sign any offered renewal.
* Be very careful when increasing rent in Seattle. If you miss any of these many requirements, your increase will almost certainly be unenforceable and it will take 6 months or more to correct your mistake.

"> Define shouldn’t. People you think should t own firearms or people that should t legally own firearms?

I guess I would counter with my own question, do you believe the current requirements are thorough enough? I do not and I am saying many people who are not qualified to own a gun do. If you want to buy a gun you should have to go through weapons training that is nationally mandated and regulated to ensure safe weapon handling proficiency, confirmation of safe storage of the weapon, mental health assessments (performed prior to license issuance, not the current check for a history of stay in a mental institute, etc.), checks for associations with gangs or terrorist groups (white nationalist groups are a perfect example here) even if you don't have a criminal history, etc. Is this qualifying as people I personally think shouldn't own guns? Sure but I would argue this is only because the current checks are not stringent enough.

> While agree we should be harsher on gun crimes in general. The idea that the guns used in the majority of violent crime are coming from legal owner private sales to prohibited people is laughable.

I agree with you on this. The thread you're responding on is specifically talking about sales so I'm keeping it in the realm of that context.

Edit: I went to go look for some studies and there actually is a fair amount of data showing that illegal weapons move in to states with stricter gun laws from those with more lax gun laws.

"Prepare to be shocked!    TV stations and newspapers will just print the Company's carefully worded press releases.

Take another look at those articles you're so fond of.    They say that flights were cancelled due to staffing.  True.  They say that the pilots conducted a picket.    Also true.   What they *don't say* is that those two things are related.    Because they aren't.

Every single one of those pilots had their faces all over TV.

Disrupting flights is illegal and they would be fired instantly for being out there if it wasn't their day off.   I doubt they got to be airline pilots if they're that stupid.

The fact is that staffing issues are because pilots are quitting left and right and new hires aren't showing up to class because they can walk across the street to Delta and make $20k more a year for a 737 and end up flying widebodies for $80k more per year. It's the simple reality.   It's going to get worse this summer.  All the flights that cancelled today, that because of picketing pilots?

10 hour hold times for phone agents. Is that the pilots, too?

"> Nope. The paradox of real estate is that new housing does NOT decrease prices.

It's not a paradox at all. Houses are considered an investment as much as a domicile. Secondarily they can't be easily mass produced with high quality. Good rentals are similar. Therefore they can't be easily commoditized. So they generally track the local and overall economy.

>Or even a significant slowdown in the rate of price growth.

Right, we've absolutely failed nationally to create enough housing stock. This is actually uncontroversial. 

>Since 2009, housing demand has outstripped supply, quite significantly in some areas. In 2018—the
latest full year for which we have comprehensive data 1 —we estimate that 1.2 million households
were formed. This compares with net new production of 850,000 units (1.2 million new single-family
and multifamily housing units were completed, and 100,000 new manufactured housing units were
shipped, but roughly 450,000 units go obsolete each year, for a net addition to the housing stock of
850,000 units). This created a 350,000-unit shortage in 2018 alone. 

https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/101553/housing_supply_chartbook_1.pdf

The cumulative increase over the [previous decade in housing in King County as of 2019 was 14%](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/nations-housing-stock-snapshot.html). That's pretty goddamn atrocious compared to the pop growth.

Out of their 20000ish employees, only around 1000 work in the state of Alaska. 

While Alaska Airlines is the [11th most major employer in Alaska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Alaska#Largest_employers), extending this logic would also mean that Alaskans have even more insight into Walmart and/or Sam's Club since they are the second largest employer in Alaska, but that doesn't make much sense.

"Born and raised here.

Have owned cars here to find them prohibitively expensive, even older cars without payments.  (Parking, maintenance, gas, etc.)

Not to mention repairs when they get broken into or parted out.

The transit system in some areas, namely the east side, still has room for improvement - but the entire system is much better today than it was 30 years ago.  In many areas, you can jump on a bus/train once every 15 minutes to get where you need to go. (Which is better than the hour long waits 30 years ago.)

Not to mention, $120 a month gets unlimited rides just about anywhere within the Puget sound area - which is a lot cheaper than car ownership and even my average of $300 a month in repairs, gas, parking, insurance - for the car i owned outright.",t2_6n4tu,jmac32here,0,1648950797.0,0,t1_i3686im,i3686im,True,the_next_1,t3_tur3lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/tur3lg/can_i_live_work_in_seattle_without_a_car/,Can I live & work in Seattle without a car?,/r/Seattle/comments/tur3lg/can_i_live_work_in_seattle_without_a_car/i3686im/,3,r/Seattle,0,3

"I see where you’re coming from - the short term you may have wealth gain (akin but not exactly income imo - though that is up for debate here) that isn’t taxed, but ultimately all of it is - whether it happens when you borrow against it (as you said) or when you die. That is why you don’t purely tax the act of taking a loan, but also lock down an inheritance tax, and what separates from just a straightforward sales-tax like model (IMO). 

The idea is to tax it all, without having the federal government needing to assign value to private businesses and other illiquid assets (art, patents, etc) yearly, as well as handle situations where assets may go down year-over-year.

It certainly may shift the individual year tax payments, but that’s something the government is particularly adept at handling.
