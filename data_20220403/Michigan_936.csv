Man, you dense motherfuckers can't even understand what an asymptomatic infection is.

Imagine a world in which you're infected, contagious, but also aren't showing any signs. Crazy, I know. But also that's this world.

"> If mask mandates and lockdowns can't (or won't) be enforced to the degree needed, doesn't that indicate they aren't a particularly effective tool for controlling a pandemic here and future planning should use different approaches?

Are you making the case for increased enforcement?

I mean, I'm all for trying different approaches, but the germs don't really care what our opinions on the topic are. 

We know that masks and distancing and lockdowns all *do* work. The issue isn't the mechanisms. The issue is the people, and the only thing that might change their opinions is better education. 

Unfortunately the same people who NEED the additional education are also the ones who vote to decrease education funding.

Like, we can show them the studies on efficacy of masking. We can explain the asymptomatic infection profile of these viruses. We can tell them ""Hey, you can be contagious while showing no symptoms, and the reason for wearing cloth masks is so YOU don't spread your UNKNOWN infection to others"".

But they laugh and say the masks are too permeable to stop the virus. Which is 100% true. And also 100% nowhere near the point, nor the goal of the masks.

unlimited pip is just your personal injury protection limit. unlimited, meaning no limit. new york and washington dc have the next highest minimum pip, which is $50k. before the new law, you were required to have, at minimum, unlimited. 

no fault just means no one is at fault following an accident and your own insurance pays your claim. in other states that aren't no fault, you pursue the at fault party for compensation.

"The best thing to do is talk with the local humane society or cat rescue about Trap and Release programs available.  This won’t immediately fix your issue but it will end the problem propagating.

i have my own trap, but the local rescues might let you use theirs.  All you do is trap a cat, drop it off with the rescue or animal control, they will get it spayed or neutered and then return it to you so you can release it.  The cat will have its ear nipped so you know if you have a cat you already trapped.  It’s actually fun to do, you have to deal with all sorts of other wildlife like skunks, raccoons, I even caught my own dog once.

TNR is probably the most effective and humane way of dealing with the issue.  Wild cats have a life span of 2-3 years.  If you just take the animal away or kill it, more will come via breeding or migration because people are feeding them.
