"Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not a person. 

You can not get life insurance on a fetus. A pregnant person can knowingly ingest  substances harmful to a fetus and face no repercussions. 

If you were not willingly ignorant about vaccines you would know that the reason most take years is solely because of cost. You would also know that ""testing, trials, and research"" are three words which mean the same thing. 

It is also disappointing that you have to lie and and say the vaccines are ""still"" in the trial phase.

"As others have stayed, hang in there if you can make the mortgage payments once the townhouse is finally done.  The place will be worth a lot more than what you originally negotiated to buy it for.

I was looking at new builds back in September 21, but I wasn't impressed with the construction quality, and I figured the realistic build time with all the supply chain issues was closer to 18 months, not to mention the crazy price increases that would price me out of the market.

I revised my search to builds in the last 10 years, and picked up a 5 year old house instead.  The former owner was very hard on the house and hid some issues with staging, but I'm willing to admit my standards are high and some things I just wasn't willing to live with.

I've been living in a never ending work zone since then, and I'm ready to kill my contractor, but we are nearly done; there's a few more projects that I will just handle myself in the near future.  At the end of it all, I'll have a basically brand new house, with the finishes I want.  All the extra cost was painful and unexpected, but I haven't over improved the house, and the way the values are increasing right now, I would still get my money out if I wanted to sell.

I was looking at new construction and they told me 6-8 months for occupancy and claimed they were running out of units already... then I drove to the development to see how many town homes were already built and they hadn't even finished the model units and I asked a guy that looked like he knew what was going on and he told me that onlt a.hand full had been presold. Needless to say I did not pre/panic buy and that 6-8 month's looks like it would probably be closer to 8-12 or beyond... this was Mid March. Assuming Blackrock or one of those groups doesnt come in to buy it all up I don't know how easy it's going to be for this development to pre sell like 600 townhomes at between $380-440k with rising interest rates ontop of supply chain delays and prices making people house poor for decades... if I decided to pre buy I would probably be living that nightmare and be house poor.,t2_74s0fytx,udodrugsdanny,0,1648955337.0,0,t1_i36hc2d,i36hc2d,True,Agreeable-Loan-9231,t3_tux851,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/tux851/home_buying_horror_story/,Home buying horror story,/r/raleigh/comments/tux851/home_buying_horror_story/i36hc2d/,-2,r/raleigh,0,-2

Yes, rates will continue to go up but they won‚Äôt go up at the same rate as prices are increasing. Wake county just hit a new record of a 10% increase in median price in a single month.

"I helped out my dad with his yard growing up. He didn't leave leaves on his yard; we raked them up and put them in a (vegetation only) compost heap. He used the compost for his garden. The HOA had rules about the front yard and grass height, so we did have to mow the lawn like anybody else would. So, perhaps I am being hypocritical. We got to do whatever we wanted with the back yard, though. It was a lot of digging, weeding, planting, laying down layers for drainage, laying down fertilizer, putting up tomato cages, maintenance, etc. It looked lovely, in my opinion. Lots of flowers, butterflies, hummingbirds, other wildlife. And the vegetables were delicious; the joy of eating the fruits of your labor definitely enhances the flavor.

In my opinion, I think whatever you can do for native plants and wildlife is fantastic. You're doing a great service for your neighborhood by providing wildlife refuge in urban areas. So, I didn't want to be critical of OP because he does appear to be trying to provide that type of space. I will admit that I don't understand the mulch or why he can't have an outdoor compost for his leaves. OP's front yard is not aesthetically pleasing, and could definitely use some more work to make it useful for both people and wildlife. I think the people aspect is just as important a factor when landscaping your property. It's your property, so do whatever you want, but I think it's better in the long run that you can enjoy your space just as much as the wildlife can. 

I have seen some beautiful yards that have no nonnative species in them, and the landowners put a lot of effort into planning and implementing their vision. OP's may not be as beautiful, and it may not look like a ton of effort went into it, but I don't think he is being lazy about it, either. But maybe I am just being naively optimistic.",t2_g7ym4,inspectoralex,0,1648944919.0,0,t1_i363fm0,i363fm0,False,hstarbird11,t3_ttzl98,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/ttzl98/to_the_person_who_called_me_lazy_because_i_dont/,"To the person who called me ""lazy"" because I don't rake my leaves",/r/raleigh/comments/ttzl98/to_the_person_who_called_me_lazy_because_i_dont/i363fm0/,1,r/raleigh,0,1

"Hi! In June, it can already be uncomfortably hot outside. There are tons of parks in the area and most of them have some kind of a picnic shelter you could rent. Pullen Park in Raleigh is great, as others mentioned. Kids Together playground in Cary is also great for kids but can get very crowded on the weekend.

I would consider Crowder Park in Apex since you have a large number of adults. This park typically has very few people, it‚Äôs large, has 3 shelters with a playground nearby, and has a pond with fish and turtles. All trails are paved and not too long, so you can easily take a group of bored guests of various fitness levels on a quick stroll.

"Hi! 

So right now the Raleigh area is struggling with venues. We've run a Tuesday night for about 10 years that at its height boasted a crowd of around 400 people a week. I see that someone mentioned City Limits was lackluster and that's not exactly incorrect. That was our 3rd venue change (previous venues closed down). 

We are currently doing every 2nd and 3rd Tuesday at Blowfish (another temporary venue) as we wait for our permanent new home venue to be built. Our next event is 4/12. 

New venue is looking to be done end of summer or early fall and then it's game on. We book pretty much all genres, so if you're strictly looking for Dubstep, be sure to check the event page or shoot us a message and we can let you know what genres to expect.  

Raleigh had a thriving edm scene for several years, but the last few years have been rough. We are definitely working on it though. 

Also, check out Sugar Society and Spacecamp on social media. 

House/techno check out Loud Crowd, Space Camp, Subtek and Morning Choir (durham).

"I appreciate what you're doing, but I also think there's a balance between ""completely wild"" and ""well kept eco-friendly greenspace"".  You can have something that's aesthetically pleasing in a way that looks like it's intentional without it being bad for nature.  Most people would probably hold an opinion that a completely wild yard in a developed neighborhood is an eyesore.

I live in the bay area, where water is at a premium, and one of the trends over the past few years has been returning grass lawns back to natural landscaping, or even more extremely, xeriscaping.  In our case, wildflowers thrive, as do succulents, citrus evergreen shrubs & bushes, and so much more, and there are hundreds of beautiful natural yards around my neighborhood. Some are raw and 100% natural, and don't look nice at all.  Most are intentional and well kept, and look great.

"NC QUICK PASS TIPS AND TRICKS:

They are indirectly connected with the DMV. If invoices were sent to the wrong address you can dispute late fees. It's recommended to pay and dispute for a refund to avoid additional charges during the waiting process if denied.

Every 2 years you can request 1 late fee waiver equal to $6 or one missed invoice. If invoices aren't arriving fast enough, you can OPT-IN to bill by email but it's up to you to keep it updated and check your spam folder.

The fastest ways to get things done are in store (a representative could immediately see the incorrect plate and waive the charges), emailed disputes to ncquickpass@ncdot.gov, and online. If you pay to some third party via bank pay, USPS, or DOXO- you can be subject to late fees.

Signing up for a private account means you basically waive your right to dispute account information. You'll get 35% off for doing everything QuickPass does with your account but it means maintaining a prepaid positive balance and keeping all information up to date yourself such as plate numbers, devices, emails, cards on file, etc.

Be kind to employees!

"I'm a proud leaf raker and leaf hoarder. Raking leaves is a great core workout. The sound of a rake is very zen-like. Leaves are excellent for building good soil and mixing with compost. In the fall, I'll even use a tarp to drag over the neighbors pine straw and leaves. 

I wish people wouldn't spray all these chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizer on their yards. Some of these chemicals have been linked to cancer and thyroid disease. I have a lush front lawn I started from some plugs of St Augustine, that needs no chemicals. Mowed leaves provide rich organic matter and help with moisture retention and to resist drought. My backyard is clover, strawberry, chickweed, and an assortment that keeps the rabbits from focusing on my young veggies. 

I don't have to buy $3-4 bags of mulch shipped across the country. Leaves and pinestraw from the fall are free mulch. Leaves and pinestraw to mulch my vegetable garden. Compost replaces fertilizer. Organic vegetables sprout every year. Asparagus comes back year after year. Blueberries feed me and the cardinals. Good soil attracts robins. Thistle attracts golden finches. Bumble bees nest under stiff flowers. 

I'm okay with people who rake and people who don't rake. What gets me are people who spray poison all over everything including the food I eat and the water I drink. When I'm left with dead bees and butterflies after the neighbor behind us has Mosquito Joe spray every month. I have to wonder if their poison gets on my tomatoes. Or the blowers. I don't like the blowers. The exhaust and dust make it harder to breath. The blown particles get in your eyes several yards away. The sound is too loud. If you have to wear hearing protection to use it, think how loud the sound is to the sensitive ears of dogs, cats, deer, and birds.

"Find standing water and eliminate it, and treat any moist areas like flower beds with Bt bits regularly so larvae can't mature into adults. You can't control what your neighbors do though and mosquitos travel pretty far... Dilute bifenthrin and other synthetic pyrethin insecticides applied to bushes will knock down adult populations and repel them for about 24-48 hours, but that involves pesticides and killing other insects. There's no point in treating grass to control mosquitos.

Torches work a bit, the smoke disorients the mosquitos but you need a lot to have any effect and smoke probably isn't good for young children. A cheap oscillating fan helps a lot in my experience since mosquitos aren't great flyers (and makes it a lot more comfortable on humid summer nights). I usually end up applying some strong DEET if I'm going to be outside for a few hours, doesn't harm any insects and works well enough. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to really repel all of the mosquitos aside from dousing around the deck and nearby bushes with insecticide (it works great in the short term, but it feels super shitty when I see things like dead/dying fireflies and beetles lying around afterward that were just minding their own business resting in a bush during the day).",t2_80vi,unknown_lamer,0,1648861094.0,0,t1_i31ztmn,i31ztmn,True,mystikez,t3_tu61k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/tu61k3/mosquito_solutions_preferably_nontoxic/,Mosquito solutions?

I‚Äôm afraid I I haven‚Äôt seen those prices for a one-bedroom in at least two years. I live in an apartment near the Greenway but our 1bd‚Äôs start at $1500 here. I had a friend who lived at Vert on Six Forks a couple years ago and that was pretty woody but not really that close to any parks or Greenway (that I knew of). Their 1br‚Äôs are starting at about $1200 right now but who knows if that‚Äôll be the same in 10 months plus that doesn‚Äôt include all the other fees they add on. Gregory in Cary seems to have 1br‚Äôs around that price point. I believe their units are a little older but I‚Äôve never lived there so I‚Äôm not quite sure how great the community is. It‚Äôll be quite challenging to find an apartment with that budget. The COL here isn‚Äôt quite as ~low~ anymore as some of those ‚Äúbest cities to live at‚Äù lists make it out to be.,t2_117f1j62,EggMellow,0,1648859381.0,0,t1_i31wfyt,i31wfyt,True,Naturelovergirl78,t3_tu5lc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/tu5lc5/hi_friends_im_trying_to_move_to_raleigh_in_10/,"Hi friends :-) I‚Äôm trying to move to Raleigh in 10 months.

"Unfortunately, prices as good as $1,100 are long gone now. You may get lucky and find something in the $1200-1250 range (this was easily done pre-COVID), but decent apartments in that range also have many applicants now. It's good that you're looking so soon. Just do as much research as possible. 

One thing about apartments surrounded by/in woods (near a lake as well) is obviously they tend to have pest issues. We have ""palmetto bugs"" aka ""water bugs"" here, which is a nice way of saying ""American Cockroach"". However, as long as they are large (adults) and not small (nymphs), you should be OK. If you do decide on a heavily wooded apartment complex, just don't get a 1st-floor unit and make sure the apartment complex has regular pest control services. Many charge for it but don't have them come out nearly often enough.

"**Contributory negligence** 
 
 [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributory_negligence#United_States) 
 
 >In the United States, the pure contributory negligence only applies in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia. The District of Columbia largely follows the contributory negligence model, but with exceptions for motor vehicle accidents involving pedestrians and bicycles. Indiana applies pure contributory negligence to medical malpractice cases and tort claims against governmental entities. In the other 45 states in the U.S., plaintiff's recovery is simply diminished by the extent to which he or she contributed to the harm under principles of comparative negligence, with some states using a mixed model of comparative and contributory negligence.

I use an electric leafblower, which is much quieter and doesn't emit nasty fumes but also doesn't quite have the same power as a gas blower, so I end up doing a good bit of raking after the initial leafblowing.
