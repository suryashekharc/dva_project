"It’s nearly impossible to find an affordable pet friendly apartment that isn’t disgusting as hell, even in the “undesirable” parts of the island. We had no idea it would be like that when we moved out here, because everywhere (businesses, parks, beaches, etc) is SO pet friendly. You can literally bring your dog to the bar with you a lot of the time. 

We moved out here 2.5 years ago and what we did was rent an Airbnb for two months while we searched. Once we realized that apartments were pretty much out the window as a possibility, we looked into mobile homes— we noticed that they were extremely cheap compared to “real houses” of the same standard. House prices have skyrocketed since the pandemic started, but by comparison you can get a really nice mobile home in a beautiful park for less than you could buy a falling down shack for LOL.

"I don’t find PST to be a major issue a there is none on groceries, utilities, insurance, rent/mortgage. As such 70% of my annual spending is without any PST. So it’s mainly automobile, clothing, communication, furniture, and other consumables.

There is an island tax for food and many other products. Almost anything not available locally can be found in Langford, a 30 minute drive south once per month. Shop sales and it’s still affordable. For example, whole chickens are $1.99 per lbs at Thrifty’s this week. Hunt around and you’ll find the “Old Farm Market”, or similar, for cheap produce. Lots of people with roadside stands offering free-range organic eggs at $5 per dozen is more than regular eggs at <$3 but doable.

How it fairs depends on what you are expecting. If you are used to small town it’s likely comparable in many respects. There are good areas and those that some people will tend to avoid. Due to mild winders, and historical issues, BC does have significant drug and homeless problems.

"Hey, thanks for your response.

I wrote this message last year when Cowichan Tribes was hit really hard with Covid and people were being fired from their jobs because they were Cowichan. I was asking for specific things to help and show support during this situation.

It worked! Me and a few other Redditors donated helpful items and made care packages for families who were isolating. One Redditor put me in touch with a local teacher and a nurse who were helping the families in isolation so the care packages could be discretely given to those in need. 

 Someone also pointed me towards a local t-shirt company who were selling shirts and car decals with the ""I stand with Cowichan Tribes"" message and logo designed by Stuart Pagaduan and donating proceeds to Cowichan charities (I think you can still custom order them at https://www.urbanvalleytees.com/). 

As I mentioned in my first paragraph, I try and advocate for a just society, and I teach my kids about racism and its effects.

"putting symbols on your windows or cars doesn't ""fight racism"" if you want to fight racism you do it in your actions and your conduct. judge people by the content of their character not the color of their skin. Simply put your day to day life if someone says a racial slur make it known you won't hear it. 

if you don't experience any racism in your day to day life or see it or anything than how is this a very important issue to you? try to focus on things you can like peaceful parenting and not spanking or harming children and instill those values into them. this is the greatest way to make a change on the Earth and teach them about how the use of violence is an immoral action like when another child pushes one that's the initiation of force or when the government says you should pay your taxes or they'll send people in blue suites with guns to harm you that's no different also the initiation of force and also immoral",t2_8gesdgdu,Honest-Star6724,0,1641525560.0,0,t1_hrl5l4c,hrl5l4c,True,sockphotos,t3_ky06xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowichan/comments/ky06xx/how_can_we_support_cowichan_tribes_and_fight/,How can we support Cowichan Tribes and fight racism during a pandemic?,/r/Cowichan/comments/ky06xx/how_can_we_support_cowichan_tribes_and_fight/hrl5l4c/,1,r/Cowichan,0,1

As a teenager in North Saanich, it was one of the few things we did to keep ourselves entertained this time of year.

"I too have had this urge and it's a little bit tough. The most difficult thing is the number of water front homes that can just lock you away from shore. I'd stick with lakes to begin with, as most of the rivers have a lot regulations on where and when you fish and everything needs to be let go. 

Shawnigan is great for small mouth bass at the moment. Just use a little spinner and do some cast and return. Look for the parks on google maps. 

Spectacle lake is nice, but really small and full of snags and you need to walk in a couple hundred meters, but there are no houses locking you out. 

Fuller seems okay but feels kind of festy for some reason. 

Cowichan lake is great but is a bit of a drive depending on where you are. Gordon Bay is really really nice. Take a picnic.  Check the regs if you can, this will help keep uncomfortable conversations with people to a minimum.

"I've lived in Duncan for 31 years and there are definitely some problem areas (as Victoria has), but Duncan overall is quite safe.  I've never had any issues walking home alone from a pub or a friend's house at night nor have I ever had anything stolen or vandalized.  As with most places, the suburbs and rural areas are the safest.

Don't forget to factor in time, driving fatigue, fuel, maintenance & repairs, and depreciation into your evaluation process.

Another poster mentioned Shawnigan Lake or Cobble Hill, which are both good.  You should probably add Cowichan Bay and Mill Bay to that list as well (adjacent CH and SL), IMO.  As you're commuting to Victoria, my recommendation would be to stay south of Cowichan Golf & Country Club because Duncan's traffic is definitely going to add considerable time and frustration to your commute if you have to travel into/through Duncan, especially during the summer.

Also, if you enjoy the nightlife on a regular basis, Victoria is definitely the place to be on the island, so I would try to stay close.  If you don't and prefer a yard, storage for toys, and some decent floor space for a comparably reasonable price, north of the Malahat but south of Duncan is where I'd look in your case.",t2_6ejsthir,n00bxQb,0,1620367745.0,0,t1_gx8t9m4,gx8t9m4,True,YippYippYipp7,t3_n6kfg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowichan/comments/n6kfg0/moving_to_duncan/,Moving to Duncan,/r/Cowichan/comments/n6kfg0/moving_to_duncan/gx8t9m4/,3,r/Cowichan,0,3

"I appreciate this answer. I've been doing the work outlined in the article for a long time and I know that there is always internal work to be done.

I'm asking this question as an outpouring of compassion and love as the article asks. I would love to see actual, helpful actions to perform that will help my neighbours. It is my belief that the vast majority of people in this community don't want to be racist and would do whatever they can to help people facing racism, but they don't know what will help and what will hurt. Suggestions for concrete actions are important!

This question is about specific ways to help a specific group at this time. Do you think some kind of visible gesture of kindness would help identify us as allies and get others to look into their own biases/practice kindness?

"Fuller and chemanius lake are great places to start, I caught my first fish ever at fuller. Orange or chartreuse powerboat on a bottom rig with a 4-5 foot leader is the ticket. But worms work amazing also just not my thing. 

The cowichan river is a good place to get into some salmon, but it’s a bit harder to bring the family out, more of a solo thing if you want to have success. 

Steelhead fishing is is just starting up on there South Island. This is a tough fishery though (fish of a 1000 casts) you can also hire guides to learn the ropes. 

Literally any dock/pier on the ocean you can catch fish off of, just use worms or mussels or anything you can forage up that fits on a hook. Use a bottom rig and you will catch small fish like sculpin, flounder and perch. Also the chance of a big ling or rockfish. 

My #1 recommendation is fuller lake tho. That is a Great Lake to learn on. Put a sliding weight on your mainline, tie on a barrel swivel, 4-6ft leader, small hook with powerbait. This is a money setup and you can use it in any lake on the island.

"Obligatory mobile user statement. 

To start, I don’t want to name names because I’m not here to put anyone on blast. I’m going to try to keep specific situations as vague as I can, although I understand that people who were around at the time might know who/what I’m referencing. And some of these people are no longer affiliated with the school or school district. 

1. Terrible administration - meaning principal, vices, reception staff, counselling, everyone. When I was a student, the certain members of admin were more concerned with climbing up the career ladder, getting Master’s degrees and personal reputations than they were with teaching or protecting students in the school. I blame issue 2 largely on this. One administrator would frequently interrupt my classes to flirt with my teacher, like every day. The flirter was married. 

2. Not one, but two instances of extremely unprofessional conduct from coaches towards students/former students. One was quite public and I think was written about in the newspaper, but the rumours I heard were a lot worse than what was published. Due to the scandal, one of my other teachers became very emotionally distressed and had to leave school for a year, another was reassigned to a different school the following year due to their proximity to the case. I was quite close with the perpetrator, considered them a mentor, and it really tore me up to hear they hurt people I knew, all while continuing to go to school where they were teaching every day. Admin did nothing to stop the rumours, the teachers gossiping, or have this person take a leave of absence. It was handled in the worst, the absolute worst way. 

The other instance of unprofessionalism was mental and emotional in nature. Playing games with kid’s heads and trying to break them, kids who just wanted to play sports. When multiple parents demanded a meeting with admin, they were told told there was nothing they could do and it was he said-she said. Despite multiple players and their parents being concerned for the well-being of their children.

From my understanding these people continue to teach in this school to this day. 

3. Blatent favouritism towards athletics. In my grade 11 year, we had an assembly where we were told that academic awards were cancelled because the same people win every year and it makes the other kids feel bad. Directly after the assembly an administator came up to my Physics classroom to see what we thought. We pretty much told them to fuck off, that academic awards were the only thing we actually had to work for - and they were shocked that we had this opinion?!?! Turned around and left. Still had athletic banquet at Arbutus Ridge though. 

4. Open disrespect between teachers and admin. My teachers did not give one fuck about what administration said or did, or what rules they set (not that I blame them). This translated to the students not giving a fuck about what administration said or did. Then, administration would retaliate. In my grade 12 year, administration refused to let my calculus class run year-long for no reason. Every year prior, Calc 12 was a year long course, because the AP exam is in May. They would group all the calc students together, teach the Pre-Calc 12 necessary for calculus, start calculus in November or so, take the test and then finish the rest of the pre-calc curriculum. Instead they split the Pre-Calc class and made us start calc in January. Why? To antagonize my teacher, that’s why. Everyone in my calc class who wrote the AP test wrote a 1 or 2 out of 5 because we simply didn’t have enough time to learn all the concepts, because we weren’t allowed to start calc until January. 

5. School building. I know they’re supposed to be building a new school so this might not apply as much, but the building is in terrible condition. Thers’s holes in the walls where they tested for absestos in the 80s, put up a warning sign and never closed up the hole. There are frequent leaky roofs, especially in the gym area. The bunsen burners wouldn’t work/leak so we couldn’t do experiments in science at times. Crossing the highway to get to courses at the other campus in 5 minutes? Give me a break!The heating never worked and I always had to wear my coat indoors. It’s built on a bog and isn’t safe in case of an earthquake - my parents used to tell me if there was one, that I should not listen to my teachers and leave the building as soon as possible because it’s not structurally sound enough to withstand an earthquake. I mean Christ, my grandfather went to high school in that building and it wasn’t brand new then!

Rant over, I think. This school was so distracting to be in, I was totally unprepared for the rigours of a top 5 university. I got fantastic high school grades because the bar was set so low. It took me a whole year to catch up with the knowledge of my peers and I scored poorly in most of first year classes because I simply didn’t have the learning tools necessary to cope.",t2_47zlqxy0,merganzic,0,1608678579.0,0,t1_ggqoquo,ggqoquo,False,Yakobmorov,t3_khxda2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowichan/comments/khxda2/describing_duncan_good_place_to_grow_upraise/,Describing Duncan?

100%. Thanks for confirming my thoughts as a parent with two kids in Duncan. At public schools there does seem to be way more misbehaving and less ability/resources for teachers to do anything about it.

"First of all, most of what kids learn is from home. No question if things are not squared off in terms of opportunities and supportive parent(s), then it will be tougher to succeed academically. 
Then comes work ethic: some kids are  keeners and will propel themselves into the world come hell or high water. 
My experience:
I have one 16 yr old at Cow High and a 13 yr old at a private school in Shawnigan lake. The younger is smart and a go-getter so would likely succeed anywhere. Younger works HARD for good grades, not a genius. The older one is less motivated but equally intelligent. The older will do well at Cowichan high but only because mom and I crack the whip old-school style and he’s receptive. Covid actually helped him because he has nowhere to run to 🤣. The biggest factor for the older is not the teaching quality or the opportunities that Cowichan high has to offer; IMO it’s the student culture. The older one hangs with kids that don’t all seem to be at school to learn, social, vaping, pot smoking and shenanigans are more in order for them. The BS rubs off on other kids and makes it hard to concentrate and get help - this, it the biggest issue for kids at cow high that are likely to succeed otherwise. 
Tl:dr know your kid and help them succeed in a way that works for them. Some will just kill it (my younger kid) and some need prodding/hand-holding (my older kid), but parental support is paramount.",t2_teq3oc6,RepresentativeBarber,0,1608655420.0,0,t1_ggpeg23,ggpeg23,True,Yakobmorov,t3_khxda2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowichan/comments/khxda2/describing_duncan_good_place_to_grow_upraise/,Describing Duncan?

As a public school teacher married to a private school teacher I can firmly say that you can get great teachers in both the private and public schools. You can also get teachers/principals that make you scratch your head and think 'How on earth did they get this job?'. You also get great kids/idiot kids in both realms. Private schools can offer way more out of school experiences because of funding (a fun discussion in our house) but these have been curtailed cos of the Rona. It also boils down to the fact that private schools can throw out kids for misbehaviour etc because you are paying to go there. It's much harder to shift public school kids. 90% of this is down to parenting.

"Respectfully, you can't expect people to slow down. Just as I can't expect car manufacturers to stop putting bright headlights into cars. Hence why I suggest making things safer. Driving from Duncan to Ladysmith is an excellent example of how a road can be well lit without lights. A steady strip of reflectors marks the top of the jersey barriers on both sides of the road, and down the middle. If anything steps out over the jersey barriers, your eyes would pick it up so fast. It's one of our strengths harking back to predator-prey days, our eyes are sharp to pick up movement.

You don't even need a jersey barriers. Just put reflectors and fresh paint down on the shoulders and down the middle of the road. The lake cow highway is horribly maintained in comparison. It sounds like this is actually a Ministry of highways issue, not CVRD. And the contractor they select to maintain it.

We need to give drivers a chance, without fighting a losing battle (asking for millions for fencing and wildlife through fares over or under the hwy).  Headlights are blinding in newer cars, and even if the trees are cut back, I can't see anything with HID headlights coming at me.  HOWEVER, put in some reflectors, and all of a sudden I have a line if sight on the side of the road that I can still see with super bright lights coming at me. 

I sound ranty at this point, but I grew up here and this has only become a worse problem. I commute to Victoria each morning in the dark, and return in the dark.

"I agree, this has been a problem for years and it seems to be getting worse.

Wildlife fencing is not only expensive, but is extremely disrupting to all animals migration patterns. I think a much more reasonable approach would be cutting back the trees on either side of the highway to improve sight lines of animals in the ditch, and the addition of a variable speed limit. For example, 100kph during the day, but an 80kph night time speed limit. Even the extra 20kph would drastically improve a drivers reaction time. They have this in areas of the US and it has proven to be a success.

"I am no highway or conservation expert but I'd start by reviewing the animal crash stats for up island before and after they installed the deer fencing and animal underpasses. We need to coexist as much as possible, so accommodate both parties would be the ideal solution.

However I recognize that's expensive. But I'm frankly sick and tired of hearing ""We can't do the right thing, it's too expensive. So let's try the cheap solution of putting two flashing amber lights on the highway and see what that does."" These are people's lives.

A thought would be to put a toll on the highway in the summer, so tourists pay for the safety upgrades needed to keep EVERYONE safe.

Another option, slow down to 50km/hr... Well, if I hit an elk at 50 it's still a bad accident. Not a good enough solution, especially when it doesn't address the fact they climb up a 45degree slope and are in front of you in a blink. Can't react to what I don't see.

You could cut back the trees 100' on both sides of the road and out street lights in so you can see them, but that still doesn't address the steep slope appearances.  There are many steep slopes into deep (>10' drop) ditches along the highway. An elk can clamber up that in a few steps, and then they're on the shoulder/hwy.

I am open to options, and am disappointed with the CVRD for not taking this seriously.

What I don't want to hear is ""Well, the fencing is too expensive and the residents of lake cowichan lives are not worth that much."" 

What do you have to say, CVRD?  With so many tourists funneling up to the lake to experience the river and new concert grounds, we should not be expecting the costs to fall on the residents alone.

Edit: the situation is worsened at night with HID and bright headlights from oncoming traffic. I literally just hold by breath and hope when I cross another vehicle at night on the hwy. I'm 34 and have 20:20 vision, just for reference.

"Cool. Sonia seems up for the job and probably is an excellent pick for this role. I am NOT a green supporter but I think this is a voice that needs to be part of the conversation, just not in charge of things so to speak. This is why I voted for Sonia in the last election here, we need her voice as part of the conversation, just not as PM. This role is about influence and she is a great pick for this role and I suspect she will do it well. My advice to Sonia is to not only listen to the loudest voices on the green side here in Cowichan which tend to be rich white women with a Karen complex. But, listen to the thousands of quite support within the building community, the fishing community, and honestly even the logging community. Find a green path that is not about shaming and division, find a path that builds a better tomorrow, even if it does not satisfy the rhetoric of the Karen’s out there, because a lot of people support a better environment even if they don’t fit in to the 1990’s version of what green is supposed to be like. If there is one thing we can learn from COVID, BLM, Forrest fires, conspiracy theories, fake news and algorithms that amplify our differences, is we need to be adaptable and ready to change our positions if we want to put humpty dumpy back together again. Which I think is what most of us want to do regardless of our political position. Sonia seems to have a quite strength that just might just be perfect for this role.

I think this link will show you Pioneer Mall; [https://www.bcassessment.ca//Property/Info/QTAwMDBENjhCSg==](https://www.bcassessment.ca//Property/Info/QTAwMDBENjhCSg==)

Once you know the address you can look up more information. Property ownership and details are public records, but there are user fees to access them. You can setup a BC online account to look up records (or find someone that has one). BC online is here: [https://www.bconline.gov.bc.ca/](https://www.bconline.gov.bc.ca/) I think the fee to look up current ownership is $10.95. Realtors, lawyers, and notaries often have accounts for this. 

I'm not sure if there is another way to access those records.

"Hey. As far as I can gather, the course is required for successful application of your PAL or RPAL. The courses are $150 (PAL) and $75 (Restricted PAL) or $200 if you take them on the same weekend. The instructors require pre-payment via e-transfer.

Once the course is completed, you have to apply for your PAL or RPAL with the RCMP via the Chief Firearms Officer, which is another $60 or $80 fee depending on which license you apply for. The wait time is 3-4 months to be approved, at which point you are licensed to purchase and operate firearms if approved. Hunting in particular also requires another license, which requires completion of the CORE program. 

Hope this helps!

Edit: As thats-amore mentioned, the PAL and RPAL are valid for 5 years, after which time you must pay the $60-80 licensing fee again and re-apply, but to the best of my knowledge you are not required to take the Canadian Firearms Safety Course a second time unless it is requested by the Chief Firearms Officer, lessening the fees for renewal by a significant amount.",t2_jzb7b,nermthewerm,0,1583281581.0,0,t1_fjf0b2p,fjf0b2p,False,[deleted],t3_fblwbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cowichan/comments/fblwbh/firearms_courses_in_the_cowichan_valley/,Firearms courses in the Cowichan Valley,/r/Cowichan/comments/fblwbh/firearms_courses_in_the_cowichan_valley/fjf0b2p/,2,r/Cowichan,0,2

"Yea so once you pass both the practical and theory tests, they’ll give you a copy of the document that says you passed, and a package to fill out that is the actual permit application.

You have to get several people’s signatures vouching for you. And a picture of you, with someone’s signature confirming that it is you. And the credit card you’re paying with. Then you send it away and it can take quite a while to have it go through the whole system and finally get you approved.

"His body was found near the Chemainus River, well outside of the original search area, and his truck was found near to where Menzies Rd meets Cowichan Lake Road. 

Other than saying the death is not suspicious and foul play isn’t suspected, no other details have been released. 

All we can do is speculate as to what happened. I’ve included a couple of the more plausible theories I’ve seen online here.

He went for a hike mid work day, had a aneurism/seizure/fell down a cliff/some other natural cause and then someone stole his truck and abandoned it where they did (the thieves would’ve had to ignore the blood in the vehicle and the smashed phone). 

The speed with which the death was ruled unsuspicious after the body was found points to there bring a very concrete method of death which could not have possibly involved anyone else, which would rule out a lot of things. To me, that precludes even falling down a cliff, because how do you know he wasn’t pushed or forced at gunpoint?

Another theory is that it was a suicide and he didn’t plan for his body to be found (perhaps for insurance purposes), but left a note on himself just in case to explain things to his family (hence the immediately knowledge of the lack of foul play). How his truck was so far from his body is a mystery if scent dogs could not pick up a trail. 

At least his poor family finally has some answers.

"If you've actually been to the Duncan Hospital for care, you would fully agree that it is in dire need of an upgrade. The average wait time for emergency services is unmanageable. I have personally sat there for hours with a child that was having trouble breathing, waiting for our turn in a system that is not equipped for a growing population. 
The article is not saying that the hospital shouldn't be built, it is saying that there is a deeper issue in the valley. The two issues are not mutually exclusive, and to compare them such is somewhat inconstructive. 
Finally, building a hospital in an area that is seeing, and will continue to see substantial growth, actually shows significant forsight. A larger facility will offer plentiful job opportunities across the economic board, something that's sorely needed in the valley, and potentially house the services needed to address the very issues you find so irresprehensible.

"Nothing wrong with the newer places, I just like the more established places a little more, there seem to be a bit more diversity in the more established “older” communities. I have friends that work as dock hands and and friends that own multi million dollar corporations, with the older  communities no one really cares if you are rich or poor, far or skinny, university educated or didn’t finish high school. (I am probably over generalizing here, but it feels more this way to me) So long as you are nice to others and up for a good time you can be who ever you are and don’t need to keep up with the Jones. Most events are potlucks, the beer is usually lucky, the wine tends to be copper moon from the 4 litre  box, someone will probably bring crab, prawns or salmon that they caught that day. When the fire ban is not on it usually a bonfire and when it is on it’s a propane fire ring. With the older communities there is a bit more space than the newer communities so people tend to have more adhoc outdoor get togethers. The newer communities are great, for me there is just more value in the older ones. Saltair also seems to be a lot like this, although I have never lived there.

No matter where you choose to live it is great for kids so much to explore and discover. 

Shawnagin lake seems like another great place, it has the elements I would look for, small, close knit communities, older places and lots of space, lots of small local businesses. It also has a summer and full time crowd so I suspect the full time crowd gets together a lot and everyone knows everyone. I would definitely have it on the list.  There is also a lot to explore there like the logging roads, hiking trails, the lakes and rivers, I would imagine those elements would be great for a young family that wants to get out and explore.

"Moved here about three years ago we ended up in Maple Bay. I honestly couldn’t be happier. We came from a huge international city of 9 million people to Maplebay with some where in the neighbourhood of 1000 people. I have more friends here than I have ever in my life. The people are what make it so special here.

My advise is to rent an airBnB in a few of the towns in North Cowichan, and see which one has the best vibe. Avoid the suburbs (the properties) and anything where the houses were all build in the last 10 years. Stop by a few of the pubs and sit at the bar and talk to the locals. Ask the question “does anyone know how to catch crabs or prawns?”. In the town where someone says “I do, want to tag along tomorrow and pull some traps?” Move there. Alternatively mention that you would be interested in learning to sail, you will probably find yourself on boat on the weekend drinking wine and having the time of your life. Move there.

Seriously, move now, life is short.

I can’t imagine it’s as bad here as it would be on the mainland, and from what I’ve seen, it’s much worse in Nanaimo, and possibly in Victoria too, but the latter may be just down to population.

"Moved here with my partner three years ago and we love it. It's a town that certainly has its rough edges that I'm suspicious were a bit rougher 30 years ago. I also know for a fact that the neighbourhood you choose to live in plays a HUGE role in your experience of Duncan. We lived in an apartment in one of the sketchier cul-de-sacs while house hunting, and it was genuinely awful. Found house, moved to a nicer neighbourhood, totally different experience. If you ever have a listing that might work and you are wondering about location, feel free to PM.

It's definitely a mental shift to move here from the city - there is less to do in the evening and its harder to meet people. If you are into the outdoors (mountain biking, hiking, etc) it's ideal. There are world class trails all over the place. There's a women's mountain biking group that is VERY welcoming to beginners and is a great way to meet people. 

There are quite a few young families here making the same move you are thinking about. We have a couple with three kids who just moved in down the street who came here from Abbottsford. I've not got kids so I can't tell you a ton more about having a family here. 

House prices are definitely going up here compared to what they were, but they are still behind the mainland. 

In summary: love the mountain biking and the hiking and the lack of commute/traffic (I work in town, if you have to go to Vic it's different). I wish we had a greater variety of restaurants and more options on evening activities. I'm not 'young family' status but I know a lot of others who are, so you would likely find others in the same boat.

"The great thing about Duncan/Cowichan valley is that you get a more small town vibe while still being pretty close to two larger cities. Victoria is about an hour away, and Nanaimo is more like 45 mins and between them there’s basically anything you might need. There’s lots of walking/hiking trails, and some great views up Mt Prevost and Mt Tzouhalem. Personally, I find that for Nanaimo and Victoria it’s pretty popular to shit on Duncan, likely because we have a fairly large population of lower income people, and a massive native reserve, but as far as I can tell there’s probably still less crime here than you’d get in Nanaimo and less of a drug issue too. I think it’s an awesome community and a great place to live.

"""Cowichan"" literally translates to ""the warm land"". It is usually the hottest place on the island. The lake can be a bit cold in the early summer, but the summer temperatures are consistently warmer than Victoria, often by a fair margin, and there's very little summer rain. It was high 20s and sunny during the May long weekend this year, for example.

Sproat Lake is nice, too, and is also noticeably warmer than Victoria.

As someone living in Victoria who has a place on Cowichan  Lake (I'm up here as we speak) the thing that really sold me on it is that it's only about a 90 minute drive from home, give or take. Sproat Lake is nearly twice that. I can leave after work on Friday and be in Cowichan by dinner, and if I want, I can get up early on Monday to get to work instead of having to head home Sunday night. That's not really as feasible when the drive is closer to three hours. Food for thought.

I'm curious from whom. Currently, you can't find a playground in town that isn't littered in used needles, and the local McDonalds has turned into a prostitution zone for teenage girls. Unless you're coming from an unfortunate area of Vancouver, there is a lot more poverty - and lot more visible poverty - than you're likely used to.

Lots of upside to the Cowichan for those who can make it work - but don't fool yourself into thinking it won't be a massive transition. If you're in a fast moving profession, you will be shocked by how different things feel on the Island. Sometimes that's good, at other times it will drive you crazy.

As an investment, the Cowichan is fantastic. Over the next 10-20 years, the area is going to be gentrified into something unrecognizable, and much of the poverty will be pushed out of sight, to the west and north.

"I love it here! There are so many wonderful outdoor areas to explore, there are wineries and restaurants galore, and the housing prices are definitely better than in Vancouver. Being an hour from Nanaimo and Victoria doesn't hurt either, it gives us lots of options.

However, many people are noticing the problems opioid addiction has brought to the town recently. It's hard to avoid if you spend a lot of time in downtown Duncan (I see strung out people daily, and actually saw someone shoot up on a closed business's doorstep two nights ago while walking to dinner). Checking parks for needles before letting children play is starting to become a thing. Be aware of these issues if you decide to move here and are choosing an area in which to buy a home.

"Thanks for bringing the whole matter to the public eye in the first place. Those two theories seem reasonable enough given the circumstances. 

It's almost believable the district has legal privacy requirements to conceal the reasons behind the departure, but the matter of his settlement or severance package has to do with civic expenditures. The public will learn how much his firing cost us sooner or later and that might re-open questions about his departure in the first place. Did the reasons for his dismissal justify the settlement payout and questions like that. These can't be shrugged off by council.

The idea of Devana walking away with almost half a million dollars won't sit well with the public unless council had a DAMN good reason for letting him go. And if they had a DAMN good reason for letting him go, they shouldn't have had to negotiate a $500K settlement (or whatever it turns out to be).

"Entertaining comment from JK. This from a guy who literally screamed at Devana, in public, at a UBCM event, that he (JK) would have him (DD) fired. Torching senior staff was a cornerstone of JK's campaign - now he's a fan of the guy? Right....

I'm a little worried about JK. He just hasn't seemed right upstairs, since losing the 2014 election.

Anyway, the two most consistent rumours are Devana materially mislead council around a couple of recent developments, exposing the municipality to civil liability, and/or he isn't real good at dealing with women, so to speak. Take your pick. 

Warren Jones scored $300k+. Whatever his other faults, Devana is a pretty smart guy, doubt he'll be walking away with less than that.

"Well fentanyl is cheaper and more powerful than heroin so they put a small amount and a buffer to stretch the product. Bad mixing practices lead to the overdoses. But with cocaine, adding a downer to it would lessen the effect of what the customer is after. It just wouldn't make any sense to add it to that. 

That said when some highly pure heroin hits the streets people OD. Having been using a certain volume to get high that volume drastically changes. 

Now that said a guy from my high school od'd on heroin but he was buying cocaine.

Haven't seen the hwy sign, so not sure about that.  Bit confused though because a few years ago Marigold nurseries already opened up a huge nursery in the Cowichan beside the Hydro power station on Bell-McKinnon Rd. It failed terribly (over-priced imo) and shut its doors after a couple years. The property still has the greenhouses on it and it was for sale for a long time, but haven't noticed the for sale sign recently.
