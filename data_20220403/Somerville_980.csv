"In Somerville specifically the city has an EXTENSIVE plan for runoff and flood mitigation. Check the city events calendar for your ward's public meetings, they're holding a few over the next few weeks I believe. One part of it is replacing the entire sewer system over the next ten years. It'll cost about a billion dollars.

The EPA is not alone in pointing out that living in transit heavy city situations is a major way to reduce carbon emissions. Infill development is a LOT more environmentally friendly than sprawling out to the burbs and beyond.

For housing production specifically we need enough homes to accommodate the growing population. If we don't build enough to get to a reasonable vacancy rate then the prices will continue to rise. 

Only when vacancy rates rise above the long run trend will we see moderation in prices. We are relatively close to that tipping point -- you saw during the early months of the pandemic that when demand slackened, so did prices. For a moment. 

That's going to require regional change, but zoning rules are controlled locally, so that's why there are all these local groups - A Better Cambridge, Newton Engine 6, Equitable Arlington, Dorchester Growing Together, Brookline for Everyone, Walk Up Roslindale, etc etc.

And of course statewide there's plenty to be done. I'm not a huge fan of Charlie Baker but Housing Choice has made it possible to make some good improvements, and the recent MBTA served community laws requiring cities in eastern MA to legalize multifamily homes will help more as well.

"What is the rundown on Housing Policy?  Are there any models or examples in our country in which affordable housing policies have actually made housing more affordable on any significant level?

"It's a number of different factors:

* COVID, which killed a ton of businesses in 2020/2021 and that reduced the supply of restaurants/bars that are open today
* The supply chain and labor shortages (great resignation and all) that spun out of COVID
* Inflation, driving up the cost of rent and food/drinks/supplies
* Restrictions on where we can build new commercial space, limiting how much we can lower rents and increase the supply of restaurants/bars in the future

I think COVID led the first wave of price increases. I saw a burrito at Los Amingos go from $8.50 to $9.50 in 2020. Lately I think it's up to $10 now and probably will be $11 to meet the sheer demand from uber eats and people who just want a burrito. Inflation and rent increases will lead the current wave, building off of the 'new normal' that COVID set. We won't see any return to pre 2020 prices for a while, and if that happens we probably end up in a recession so it won't really be a great thing.

We could make it easier to build/open new bars/restaurants, but those changes will take time and IDK if there's really a political will to make any real changes. Same problem with increases in rents, the solution is ""build more housing"" but doing that takes changes to zoning, and then there's still a huge lag in construction that will take months to years.",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1649006461.0,0,t1_i38u8bh,i38u8bh,True,Old-Cockroach1921,t3_tvaqhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tvaqhp/why_are_food_and_drinks_in_the_boston_area_so/,Why are food and drinks in the Boston area so expensive if servers/bartenders only make $5-6 an hour?,/r/Somerville/comments/tvaqhp/why_are_food_and_drinks_in_the_boston_area_so/i38u8bh/,2,r/Somerville,0,2

"The zoning map for Somerville really makes this obvious: https://www.somervillema.gov/sites/default/files/zoning-map.pdf

Outside of the big squares like Teele/Davis/Ball/Magoun/Union/Assembly everything is pretty strictly zoned residential. Some exceptions along 'commercial' streets like Highland, Broadway, Beacon, Holland, etc but those also tend to be next to the previously mentioned squares.

We could overhaul this map. I see a proposal from 2019 wasn't much better though: http://www.somervillezoning.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/20190821-Proposed-Zoning-Atlas-of-the-City-of-Somerville.pdf

"> If there are two agents, but you've only interacted with one of them, then the one you didn't interact with couldn't have fulfilled the required parameters to legally charge you a fee, so they could not legally charge you a fee. If your broker splits the fee with the landlord's agent, that's up to them.

If the landlord uses a broker, then you are forced to interact with them if you want that apartment. If you also use a broker, who found this apartment on say MLS for you - you've interacted with both. IDK the legality around them _both_ charging you a fee, but from what I've heard they typically just split the fee. Likely because it makes both of them money and if they both tried to charge you a fee, on top of the landlord's fairly standard 3 months of rent upfront, no one would rent that apartment. Or the potential renter would be a unicorn with 5 months of rent sitting around but not looking to buy a condo or house.

Totally insane IMO that we're expected to fork over this kind of money for the privilege of renting an apartment, but that's the insane Boston housing market for you.

"> Ah thanks. TIL. That said, the laws around how fees must be disclosed are pretty clear, and an agent is going to have a hard time claiming that you owe them a larger fee than one month if they don’t cross all their t’a and dot all their i’s, at which point you’ll know what you’re getting yourself into unless you don’t bother to read financially significant legal documents you sign.
> 
> 

They can charge you whatever they want - it's up to you to agree, negotiate (""hey, the standard fee around here is 1 months rent - what gives? and the apt is kinda crappy, I'd only pay half months fee max"") or walk away.

> That said, the landlord cannot collect any broker fee regardless of circumstances, only their agent if they have one.

Correct. They also cannot charge other fees besides the following:

* first month's rent
* last month's rent
* security deposit equal to one month's rent
* lock fees - for buying and installing new locks

A broker can charge you a fee. A landlord may use a broker, who would thus charge you the fee. It's dumb - even if you find the perfect apartment, if a landlord decided to use a broker _you_ pay the fee. It should be on the landlord if they use one, or on you if you use one. But that is not how it works currently sadly.

Typically, if you use an agent and the landlord uses an agent, I've seen them split the fee. I don't know if they could _both_ technically/legally charge you a fee... the law doesn't really say how that works (I'm also not a lawyer, so there's that). I imagine if the market allowed to they could prob get away with such a thing unless you report them to the AG's office.

Any other fees should be dismissed and you should tell them you're not paying them. You'll probably lose the apartment, but I'd report them to the AG's office after that happens to see if they get some shit from them. I'd personally just walk away from anyone charging illegal fees too - those companies/landlords are usually doing other sketchy shit and if they're so blazzen to charge you an app fee, or a pet fee, or any other fee - just wait til you sign the lease and find them doing other sketchy/illegal stuff.

"> Legally you cannot be charged more than one month’s rent as a broker fee, regardless of who you are or are not working with.

This is also incorrect. Broker's can charge you a fee. They need to give you a written notice of how much the fee is. There is no legal maximum for this fee. Sources:

* [KNOW YOUR RIGHTS WHEN YOU RENT IN BOSTON](https://www.boston.gov/departments/housing/know-your-rights-when-you-rent-boston)
* [254 CMR 7.00: APARTMENT RENTALS ](https://www.mass.gov/doc/254-cmr-7-apartment-rentals/download)

The quote in question:

> (1) Notice to Prospective Tenants. Brokers and salespersons engaged in renting real property,
whether by written agreement or not, **shall provide each prospective tenant for whom he or she
charges a fee, with a written notice that states that the prospective tenant will pay a fee for such
service, the amount of the fee, the manner and time in which the fee is to be paid and whether
or not any fee or any portion thereof will be payable by the tenant if a tenancy is not created.**
This written notice must be given by the real estate broker or salesperson at the first personal
meeting between the broker or salesperson and a prospective tenant. It must be signed by the real
estate broker or salesperson, contain the license number of such broker or salesperson, be signed
by the prospective tenant and contain the date such notice was given by the broker or salesperson
to the prospective tenant. Where a prospective tenant declines to sign such written notice the real
estate broker or salesperson must note on such written notice the tenant’s name and the refusal
to sign such notice.

What _typically_ happens is this is a 1 month's rent fee. It's a nice number that ties into the existing other requirements landlords can request upfront, such as first month's rent, last month's rent and a security deposit worth up to 1 month's rent.

You are correct on this bit:

> Given that a huge majority of units around here have a fee, using a realtor is actually a decent idea, though you have to be aware that they don’t really do anything aside from drive you around to see places nowadays. You’re lucky if they know anything about the unit.

But again, YMMV - some agents are decent. Some list the same apartments every time the landlord rents an apartment. I know my own landlord uses the same company - I just saw them list our downstairs neighbors unit through them and the same agent I spoke to about this apartment 2 years ago is the one listing it. If you find the perfect apartment and it's listed by an agent, you may just have to fork over that fee unless you want to continue your search for who knows how long.

"I hate real estate agents as much as the next person, but you're incorrect on this bit:

> It’s bad enough when you have to deal with their realtor, but to pay for one on your end as well?? Just a total waste of money.

You only pay 1 month's fee, even if you have an agent. Typically if the landlord has an agent and you have your own agent, they split the fee. I have never heard of someone being charged 2 months rent (double fees basically) because they had their own agent.

Likewise, while you and I may hate agents and find them a waste of money, it's not the worst thing in the world for someone to recommend. We do not know what the OP's situation is. Maybe they don't currently live here - then a real estate agent is amazingly useful, IF you find the right one. Most agents in my experience are useless. But occasionally you get a good one recommended and they can be worth their weight in gold if you don't live here but do not want to get scammed. They can tour units _for_ you and do FaceTime/Zoom showings for _you_. They can get you a list of rentals in your given area with your given budget and amenities without you doing hours of research. The right one will save you time and save you the heartache of sifting through Craigslist scams.

Now I'd personally just say go on Craigslist/Zillow/Hotpads/Facebook Groups/Facebook MarketPlace/ the /r/bostonhousing sub/etc. But maybe spending hours looking for a place isn't in the OP's cards, or maybe they cannot physically make it to random Craigslist showings.

"This has been a common topic on /r/bostonhousing/ which I recommend subbing to. You may find better help on that sub too for more niche questions - a lot of Boston area real estate folks post on there.

For your question - this isn't really too surprising. MA Law and Somerville City regulations do not require any specific notice period for a landlord/tenant to renew or not renew their lease. _Some_ leases will add a clause in for this - typically 30 days, at most 90 days, though it's not illegal to say ""180 days"" or something absurdly long. Since most renters do not really know what their plans will be for the next year (it's why people rent, flexibility and all) you are unlikely to find any real listings until closer to June 1st. I'd start looking then, but casually keep an eye out for stuff that pops up for 7/1 and 8/1 as sometimes you can grab those and move in a month or two earlier (YMMV depending on your budget and flexibility in this situation). Most listings will appear by July and August, as most folks will give at least 30 days notice as a heads up to their landlord. And most landlords will want to know whether to expect a renewed lease (stability) or if they might need to start posting the unit and showing it to secure a tenant for next year.

Basically - not even 4/1, or 5/1, but 6/1 to 7/1 is when most posts will go up. If you're open to a 7/1 or 8/1 lease (rare, but nice) try looking now to 4/1 but don't expect much so do it casually and mostly for giggles/to see if anything particularly nice looking pops up off the 9/1 lease cycle.",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648817912.0,0,t1_i2z7qah,i2z7qah,True,anchordown16,t3_ttdgdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/ttdgdh/anyone_have_luck_looking_for_an_apartment_for_91/,Anyone have luck looking for an apartment for 9/1?,/r/Somerville/comments/ttdgdh/anyone_have_luck_looking_for_an_apartment_for_91/i2z7qah/,2,r/Somerville,0,2

My experience with electric traps is they kill the heck out of 1 rat, and then they smell like dead rat and they never ever catch a second one. At $40 a trap off amazon, that doesn't work.

"The evidence you've brought to the table, as you mention, is anecdotal, which is not really all that useful. The truth is people need help and doing nothing doesn't solve the problem. A network of support is necessary and safe consumption sites are just one piece of that. There's plenty of evidence supporting against the idea that safe consumptions sites bring crime.

Here's some more:

>The preponderance of the evidence suggests these sites are able to provide sterile equipment, overdose reversal, and linkage to medical care for addiction, in the virtual absence of significant direct risks like increases in drug use, drug sales, or crime. OPCs may represent a novel way of addressing some of the many challenges presented by the overdose crisis, and they could contribute to reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved public health.

&#x200B;

>This systematic review of 22 effectiveness studies relayed evidence of the public health benefits of SIFs for SIF clients as well as to surrounding communities. The strongest evidence suggests that SIFs may help reduce overdose morbidity and mortality and improve access to addiction treatment. An increase in crime, an often-cited concern of SIF opponents, was not observed to be associated with SIFs in most included studies, and crime was actually found to decrease in 2 studies (1 greatest and 1 least suitability of design).

"THere was a really ineresting post on here or the somerville facebook a few months ago that was an honest effort to discuss rat control. And, the person who wrote it found some study (studies?) that suggested the effective kill rat for the rate population is 96% if you want to affect them. Otherwise, killing rats just creates more rates because there are fewer rats competeing for food/water so then it's easy for rats to make more rats. And, rats make a lot of rats really fast. 

The studies and/or authors concluded that you can only control living space, water, and food supply to limit rat population. And, in a city like ours, space and water are always available - so, clamping down on food supply is the only way to address rats. This essentially means doing better with waste management - especially food waste. City/region wide.

The argument made so much sense to me - I don't know how valid it is! but, it passes my gut check. And, if it' is, in fact true, the electric kill motels may exaccerbate the problem. Has the new Director (Czar?) of Rat Control addressed this at all?

"For what it's worth, (1) I wouldn't want a liquor store in my neighborhood either, for that very reason you linked, and (2) I don't want ""those people"" thrown in jail at all. I used to volunteer at the Nashua Street jail, I am well aware how not appropriate that facility is for the homeless and addicted.

That methadone clinic study you linked compared crime rates at 25m away from a clinic to 75-100 meters away from a clinic. I'm not surprised there was no difference at such short distances. For comparison, that liquor story study looked at distances over four times greater (426 meters, 1400 feet). I bet the results would be the same if the subject matter of the two studies were reversed; in other words, we would see increase in crime around methadone clinics if we looked 400+ meters away, and we would see no difference in crime around liquor stores if we looked at only 100 meters away.

Anecdotally, the I think all reasonable people agree the situation around the East side of the Boston Common, and the situation at Mass and Cass, are not good. Whether that is characterized as high crime depends on whether you look at violent crimes only, all reported crimes, or try to estimate unreported crimes in addition to reported crimes. But either way, I think everyone agrees it sucks there and the reason is two fold: concentration of service providers, and the closure of the Long Island facility. I know the Long Island facility issue is whole can of worms too.

Maybe it would be better there was no concentration of these kinds of service providers all in one area? Like a rule that says methadone clinics, food banks, and homeless shelters cannot all be within X distance of each other. That way a neighborhood can have 1 of those things, but not all at once?

"Yeah, reading through the complaint and the articles, my takeaway is that there is a dispute with a former tenant who signed some sort of agreement but later backed out. Can't really weigh in on who is in the right, but if the former tenant has a case, she needs a lawyer and probably should be able to negotiate something. That's the main issue here.

He definitely seems to be overreacting to the protest and the article by launching a lawsuit against a student paper for emotional distress. That seems unlikely to go anywhere and it looks like his own lawyer tried to talk him out of it.

The student paper was a bit sloppy where he clearly said in the email interview that he recognized one of the protesters as a tenant and then the paper said that he repeatedly said that no tenants were there. Then they said that according to their interviews on the scene, two of the 15 protesters were tenants. Sloppy reporting, but also a mountain out of a molehill.

Calling the guy a ""slumlord"" seems over the top without providing any evidence. He gave a pretty reasonable explanation about the charge that he raised rents during the pandemic. He said that increased rents had been agreed on in the leases signed before the pandemic and went into effect after it began. That's not a violation of the law or particularly underhanded. There were two cases where he lowered rents to existing tenants who had lost roommates during the pandemic, but then raised it when they later got roommates. And he says he has 3,000 units.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"Believe it or not I've actually read this extremely low-impact article before, as it has been pushed on me by free-market development heads a couple times now. If you had read it carefully you would note that even the author notes that the effect of building market-rate housing on affordability in high cost-burdened submarkets is negligible. So[merville is an extremely cost-burdened city](https://www.somervillecdc.org/affordable-housing/), with 43% of the city facing housing cost burdens (44% among renters), [with 80% (!) of people up to 50% area median income (AMI) cost-burdened by housing](http://www.housing.ma/somerville/report). The salutary effects your author suggests wouldn't even touch these people based on his model. The cost-barriers to moving in this city are also constantly increasing, from landlords asking for larger deposits or more months up-front, to predatory broker fees being forced onto the renter. Causing a sudden churn in the housing market can mean a lot of pain for renters who may simply end up in lower-income communities out of town where rents are more stable.

I will once again reiterate that I am not against development and would in fact support a push to build more homes once YIMBY gang explains to me how they will work to guarantee long-term residents the right to keep their tenancy and not be displaced out of town by opportunistic rent hikes.

"My problem is that the YIMBY's that I've encountered have totally adopted the line that rent-control and social housing legislation always necessarily inhibits development.

"The sad part is this ""article"" or ""blog post"" or whatever it is even mentions there was a proposal to add housing at Davis Sq but it got axed:

> Scape North America’s project along Elm Street and extending along Grove Street calls for construction of a four-story building – originally intended to be residential but now with retail on the ground floor and lab and office spaces on upper stories. Scape, a London-based real estate owner, operator and developer, arrived in Boston in 2018 with plans for $1 billion in local investment; in July 2019, it signed a $10 million, 99-year ground lease for the Davis Square property, according to the Boston Business Journal.

Which is sad. Where the hell are the additional ~490 new workers supposed to live? Even if half are already here, that's still close to 250 people who will want to live around Davis.

I really hate and love all this new lab space they're building all over the place. It's cool, we probably need it or want it for the new jobs they bring and the commercial tax dollars is nice, but the existing housing stock isn't expanding and I can see on my bike rides around the City that TONS of the existing housing stock is being renovated to attract these new engineers. And I've personally had 2 of my landlords since moving here express interest in selling their rental properties that I live(d) in, likely because of the crazy market we're in which is all tied back to a super limited amount of supply and virtually endless demand with all these new office spaces popping up. So we're in for lots of displacement without much space for folks to go, pushing people further out, increasing traffic since we haven't expanded the T much (bar the GLX project, which doesn't even hit Route 16 or go further to really help...) and there's not much of an alternative for most folks. People get pushed too far to walk, maybe they _could_ bike but the paths aren't being expanded much either and that only helps a small amount of folks dedicated to biking year round.

"AMC (I wrote a comment with links [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tnb85n/any_hobby_groupsactivities_coming_back_now_that/i22g7w8/)) is the best IMO if you like hiking and meeting folks for climbing/drinks/random events. It's a 20's and 30's crowd too so if that's your age range you'll fit right in. They do organize some events not geared specifically towards young folks too, and they don't discriminate so don't worry if you're outside that age range lol.

[NEMBA](https://nemba.org/) is another great group if you're into mountain biking. It's definitely geared towards 30's/40's aged dudes but you'll find young folks and ladies joining in too. [The Greater Boston \(GB\) Chapter](https://www.nemba.org/chapters/gbnemba) organizes group rides all summer long at places like the Fells, the Western Greenway, etc. You do need an MTB so it's a bit of a ""are you already into expensive hobbies and riding your bike down mountains and jumping over rocks and trees"" kind of thing. I'm really interested in finding a gravel/road riding group too - NEMBA is the _New England Mountain Biking Association_ so they're totally focused on at least forest roads, single track and crazy techy stuff vs more mellow road/gravel riding.

Also, /r/BostonSocialClub is a good sub to subscribe to and follow for random events and meetups. You could post there too if you're willing to organize stuff. I've posted a few times about climbing at BKB and made some friends that way. 🙃",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648218276.0,0,t1_i22h1zt,i22h1zt,True,boston-yeti,t3_tnb85n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tnb85n/any_hobby_groupsactivities_coming_back_now_that/,Any hobby groups/activities coming back now that COVID numbers are getting better?,/r/Somerville/comments/tnb85n/any_hobby_groupsactivities_coming_back_now_that/i22h1zt/,2,r/Somerville,0,2
"Here's their website: https://ym.amcboston.org/

You can search AMC's website for their activities too: https://activities.outdoors.org/search/?aud=15&grp=2

I also joined their _SOS_ (**Spontaneous Outings and Socials**) Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/amc-sos

The SOS link is the best IMO - you'll get emails whenever someone organizes a trip. For example they're going to Blue Hills tomorrow at 9am - you can find that email, click on it, join and meet a bunch of cool folks. I've done their Lynn Woods hike last year and it was pretty fun, lots of new people. And when I went to another event on the Esplanade I met some of the same folks there so it was an easy way intro (""HEY didn't I hike with you the other weekend?).

Most folks who join are joining with the hope/intention of making hiking friends too, so it's a great group for meeting new folks. Can be super helpful for carpooling too for the folks without a car. I know one of the leaders is always willing to pick a few folks up from one of the T stops in Quincy too.",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648217929.0,0,t1_i22g7w8,i22g7w8,False,boston-yeti,t3_tnb85n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tnb85n/any_hobby_groupsactivities_coming_back_now_that/,Any hobby groups/activities coming back now that COVID numbers are getting better?,/r/Somerville/comments/tnb85n/any_hobby_groupsactivities_coming_back_now_that/i22g7w8/,6,r/Somerville,0,6

Yes definitely! Adults should avoid riding bikes/scooters on sidewalks wherever possible so definitely take the bike lane where there is one. Like someone else mentioned you should definitely have front and rear lights if you’re riding on the street after dark.

"You'll definitely get a pre-k or k slot, you just might not get it at your local school. (Theoretically a spot isn't guaranteed but they're quite proud of the fact that they've never had to turn someone away yet.) Something like 80% of the pre-k classrooms are at Capuano school, with generally only 1-2 classrooms at each of the other schools. Depending on what side of town you live on, this can be somewhat annoying or kind of awesome. Capuano is a GREAT school, but the dropoff commute can be rough if you're over in west Somerville.

In terms of rec stuff, there is more than I can really wrap my head around, but my kids love the swim classes at Kennedy and the soccer program. The competition for the sports slots is high enough that it's wise to sign up the day signups open.

Look into ECIP and afterschool lotteries early as well if you want those.

No one is refuting the basic concept of supply and demand. The issue is that the ""lets focus on building market rate houses"" idea ignores the reality of the market—a point I've already labored over. The capitalist free market isn't altruistic. It is a machination designed to extract value.

To be clear I'm not saying not to build or not to build taller (within reason) buildings. I'm saying that a lot of that needs to be affordable—which may make it less appealing to developers, but makes the city's housing more equitable.

">Converse, you'd likely also be unable to provide an example of a place that had high density, high demand, and was able to maintain affordable housing by dropping regulation and letting the powers of the market work their magic.

Kowloon walled city. Extremely high density but literally no regulation besides those imposed by the reality of not getting hit by planes head to the nearby airport. Prices were far, far below anywhere even remotely as dense. 

Obviously I don't think everywhere should follow that as a model, but strictly in terms of pricing to zoning limits, it follows the theory. Conversely, park City, UT is pretty sparsely populated yet incredibly expensive due to zoning limitations. 

I'm not making this up, wherever supply is low relative to demand prices will be high.

"You said at one point something was basic economics. That's what this is. High demand means prices go up. As local economies continue to converge on large regional cities demand will only increase around those places. Absent some external force (ex. specialized local economy collapses) the market is essentially rigged to only drive prices up.

We are clearly talking theory here, so I find the fallback to demanding an example a bit disappointing. I obviously can't give you an example of what you've stipulated and if I could you'd likely still be unconvinced.

"Hi! I currently have a kiddo who is a Community Peer in the ECIP program at Capuano in East Somerville, and I’m decently well versed in the offerings in Somerville.  I’m happy to answer whatever questions you have if I can.

When is your kiddo’s birthday? A lot of the lottery registration is happening now for pre-K programs.  

SMILE is the program for those who will turn 4 by Aug 31.  This is the program most folks do.  The school day runs from 8:45-1:45 with limited after school program spots available.  There are limited seats (usually 1 class of 18 kids) at many of the neighborhood schools, anyone who doesn’t get a spot there via the lottery will get placed at Capuano, which is the Early Childhood Center— the school that only has pre-K and K.  While spots aren’t technically guaranteed, as far as I know, there’s never not been enough spots for all the kids who need them.

ECIP is the Early Childhood Integrated Program.  This is a 2 year looped program where half the kids are special needs and half are “typically developing peers.”  Peers are eligible for a lottery as long as they will be 3 by March 15, 2022.  So, if your kiddo is on the older end of the academic year, this program allows families to potentially access 2 years of preschool through the city.  Typically, spots in ECIP fill and there’s a waiting list, though last fall’s enrollment was down drastically, so everyone who applied to the program got a spot, and there are still spots available! I’m not sure what will happen next year though.  ECIP is only at Capuano; there are no ECIP classes in neighborhood schools.",t2_b5oajuh8,mmouse9799,0,1648163028.0,0,t1_i1ztjpz,i1ztjpz,True,tormontorcam,t3_tmqy2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tmqy2c/city_programs_for_young_children_in_somerville/,City Programs for Young Children in Somerville,/r/Somerville/comments/tmqy2c/city_programs_for_young_children_in_somerville/i1ztjpz/,11,r/Somerville,0,11

"MA Law has no default answer. It's essential up to the two parties to work something out. In theory, you could just walk away on Sept 1st without notifying your landlord. They would likely ask you well before this for their own planning purposes. This isn't true for month to month tenancies though - in that case you **are** expected to give 30 days notice on either side (landlord or tenant).

_Typically_ most folks will ask 30 days or more before their lease ends. Because their landlord might jack the rent, or not be interested in renewing for some reason like selling or flipping the property. So you need time to look for a new apartment too.

"The lease might not say this. Even if it does, I'm not aware of any laws preventing a landlord from asking whenever they feel like it. Property owners have rights like tenants do, and one of those is deciding what they want to do with their property. Maybe the landlord wants to sell the place and cash out in this crazy market (my landlord wants to do this - fun times). If so, that could be why they're asking now. I already asked my landlord what his thoughts were on lease renewals after he decided to have a real estate agent come by and look at the place last week. 🙃",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648139179.0,0,t1_i1y5cdh,i1y5cdh,False,cokdok,t3_tm4fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/,Landlord asking us to re-sign for Sept 1 lease already?,/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/i1y5cdh/,1,r/Somerville,0,1
"90 days is typically the most a landlord will ask for, since it gives both parties a good range of flexibility. You get a good amount of time to decide and potentially look for a new place. They get 2 or 3 months of listing the apartment before the lease is up. I have the same clause in my lease personally (90 day notice).

This is quite early, but not too crazy. Some folks get asked in December what their plans are. That's typical around college neighborhoods that rely on students renting in the Spring for the Fall semester.

I would also add that there is no real legal protection for renewing a lease. The OP doesn't particularly have a ""right"" to ask for more time. They _can_ ask for more time, but once the discussion of lease renewal comes up it's a negotiation. Either party can walk away. If the OP asks for more time, they're gambling that the landlord will negotiate with them. They might not - the landlord can list the apartment on Craigslist if they want to and start showing the place with (typically) 24 hours notice.

The OP should basically spend this week thinking about their plans. If they're hesitant, maybe it's worth gambling and asking for more time to decide or asking questions. But if they think they're going to stay here another year, and the rent is acceptable, then I'd just renew and avoid any risk of being forced to move. Housing stability and maintaining the same rent is quite valuable in this absurd housing market. They should take a look at Zillow/Hotpads/Craigslist and see what similar apartments rent for. Consider if you're willing to fork over for a brokers fee or not, and how much you're willing to search for a new apartment. Do you have first/last/security deposit saved up already? You'll need that with how insane this market is. And possibly a brokers fee too if you can't find a non-real estate agent listed unit. OH and who knows what your new landlord will be like. Will they jack the rent +$500 next year? Who knows.

Basically, there's a lot of risk with pushing back.

"> We are currently in a Sept 1 2021-Aug 31 2022 lease and just received a letter from our landlord asking us to decide on whether we would be resigning for the ‘22-‘23 year, with the decision deadline being the first week of April. We have friends with June 1 dates that haven’t even been contacted by their landlord yet. He is offering to keep the rent the same, which is great and somewhat unexpected, but we are not sure if we are ready to commit and re-sign when we are still nearly 6 months from the start of the next lease term.

Yeah I don't think it will either, but it's possible the OP's landlord has a different read on this market. OR isn't super greedy and just wants stability. Doesn't really matter either way I suppose, the OP is probably in the best position you can be in right now: no rent increase and a stable 12 month lease on the table.

> The other reason may be that they know that with a new tenant they'll need to make improvements to the apartment that OP is currently ignoring (broken dishwasher, peeling paint, etc.)

Actually that seems more likely. They figure OP is already at the max for rent they can get without investing time/money into the place, so they're looking to lock in the existing rental income for a while. Maybe they bother to do some work next year if they feel like it. I've also seen the housing renovation market be kind of insane - my parents waited weeks for a new stove last year for example. Maybe they figure the supply chain/labor shortage/etc we've been dealing with gets better next year, but isn't worth dealing with this year.",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648126177.0,0,t1_i1xa5pn,i1xa5pn,False,cokdok,t3_tm4fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/,Landlord asking us to re-sign for Sept 1 lease already?,/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/i1xa5pn/,1,r/Somerville,0,1
"It's pretty typical that landlords start asking existing tenants in the spring whether they want to renew or not. They're mostly greedy old boomers who purchased their property for $50k in 1976 but they still see dollar signs like the rest of us and can't fathom losing out on $2000+/month in rental income. They generally want what we tenants want too: stability. Constant income coming in with good tenants who pay on time and do no or minimal damage to the unit is perfect.

Since your landlord is _not_ increasing the rent, I would recommend you sign ASAP. You can browse this sub, /r/boston, /r/CambridgeMA and /r/bostonhousing for at least a dozen cases of recent posts where the OP has been hit with a giant rent increase. This is unlikely for smaller landlords (those posts were almost all luxury buildings or corporate landlords) but still possible. You haven't mentioned what type of building you live in and every landlord is unique, so YMMV. Still, you seem to be in a good position compared to most.

You could ask for more time to decide, but honestly, why do you need time? Lock in some housing stability at the same rate now while you can. Should you need to move, you can ask about subleasing. Or perhaps ask _now_ if the landlord is open to a sublease on the unlikely chance you need to move. This should allow you and your roommate(s) or SO or what not to have a bit more flexibility if needed while still having much needed housing stability for the next 18 months.

I'd also leave you with an anecdote of how fortunate you are that your landlord is renewing. My first landlord decided to try selling their property (a 2 family) so they didn't renew my lease. I found a new landlord in Sept 2020 and resigned last year, but guess what he just told me for this year? Yup, he's trying to sell this property and doesn't seem open to a standard 12 month lease. So at least your landlord wants to keep you and isn't so greedy to try and cash out in this crazy housing market we're in. 🙃",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,1,1648125785.0,0,t1_i1x9edq,i1x9edq,True,cokdok,t3_tm4fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/,Landlord asking us to re-sign for Sept 1 lease already?,/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/i1x9edq/,3,r/Somerville,0,3

Landlord might be reading the market differently than his greedy peers. There's no way these constant 40%+ rent increase posts can be sustainable in the long run. The landlord might think things will go south and wants to lock in an existing tenant at the same rate for an easy renewal and fairly easy renting for everyone involved. Landlord confirms s/he has another 12 months of rent, and the OP doesn't get hit with a rent increase or booted because the landlord decided to sell the property.

There's really no benefit to not locking this in now. Maybe there's risk if a marketing crash happens - but those are extremely unlikely. We'd need a new pandemic to return to what the crazy 2020 rental market looked like. If the OP decides they want to move next year, subleases are pretty easy to find and most landlords do not mind if you vet them. Worse case the OP finds themselves staying in the area a bit longer than they want, or perhaps moving out a month or two early and paying for 2 places for that time. Which isn't bad either since you get to move out on your own pace vs on the mad rush that Sept 1st is.",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648125330.0,0,t1_i1x8jay,i1x8jay,False,cokdok,t3_tm4fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/,Landlord asking us to re-sign for Sept 1 lease already?,/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/i1x8jay/,6,r/Somerville,0,6

"The City’s Construction and Detours web site at [http://somervillema.gov/construction](http://somervillema.gov/construction) is a good place to start for questions like this. 

Using the search box there to look up “cross street” brings up a number of hits, including:

[City of Somerville > Home > News > Cross St. National Grid Gas Work](https://www.somervillema.gov/news/cross-st-national-grid-gas-work) 

That, in turn, links to [this May 2020 PDF of a letter about construction that year](https://www.somervillema.gov/sites/default/files/may-2020-update-cross-st-somerville-wo-780703-constr-r2.pdf). 

Hmm. This is less helpful than I intended. I’d have sworn that at one point, I saw a page on the City’s website with a map of current & future planned infrastructure improvements, but now I can’t find it. 

I know there’s a multi-year project going on with Pearl St right now, for example, where over the past few years the water main lines were replaced, then the gas lines. Now that the underground work is complete, the next stage is to repave the street and reconfigure the lanes. 

I think that Cross St is in a similar multi-year improvement cycle, but at the moment I can’t find details, other than the list of “Improvement Projects” links on the [Construction](https://www.somervillema.gov/detours) page.

Anyway, TLDR the city is working block-by-block to improve the street infrastructure, pretty much across the whole city. A lot of the water system, for example, is \~150 years old now, and way overdue for an overhaul. A lot of the street surfaces aren’t in great shape, but it doesn’t make sense to repave them when they’re about to get dug up again, so the general strategy is to get the underground improvements finished, then rework the surface.

"One US senator, one US congressperson, the mayor of Somerville, eight Somerville city councilors, three state representatives, and one state senator all attended the [CAAS press conference this past Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tfytg2/dont_let_the_glx_become_the_gentrification_line/). They were there to listen to three tenants complain about threats of being displaced from their homes. They were not there to talk or to be typical self-aggrandizing politicians, although Markey couldn't resist the urge to leap in front of the microphone at the end which was kinda amusing.

But this is the internet. And online, there is this huge fleet of braindead jackasses who claim things that aren't real, like the idea that those who attended the CAAS Press Conference or support their mission are all Maoists or all communists or should get on a plane to North Korea or have rage issues and are about to shoot up a Whole Foods.

Some of the users posting below are sad reminders of the millions in the US who are against representative democracy and believe that an organized public speaking to their representatives is not American. These are the vile ones. They think the American Way is not representatives listening to their constituents. It makes them so upset that they must misrepresent reality online over and over again. Representative government makes people like them so upset that they broke into the US Capitol last year to smear shit on the walls and twirl a noose around.

Tenants have rights, you braindead harassing, language-abusing, history-abusing trolls who are against reality and against representative democracy. They really do. Not in some unfathomable future, but right now.

"Migraines for one.  There are a number of clinics out there where some doctor has realized doctoring is hard, and instead they can line up a patient every 5 minutes asking some cursory questions and then sign off on a card for $1-200.  It's transparently corrupt, and ludicrously easy if you cough out the cash, and makes you wonder if this gravy train is related to how recreational is so slow to take off.

For it to be worth it you have to make the money back the 20% tax.  I think you're looking at around $200 a year to maintain a card, so you have to spend $1k to make it worthwhile.  Which for most of us is a *lot* of weed, even at the absurd prices.  But for some heavy stoners it's just a month or so.  For reference, my partner and I vape some flower every evening, and spend about $2-300 a year between us, so totally not worth getting a card except I have to go to Arlington right now to get some.

AFAIK in Oregon they had medical, voted for recreational, and so the next day every dispensary just opened their doors to everyone of age.

"That is an interesting observation!  All the non-squares you list seem like super well known very specific place names.  

Here's my random speculation based on no insider knowledge or anything: for brevity, they'll leave off the ""Square"" is possible, but will include it if they think there's any possibility of confusion, or if the square isn't well known. Applying my bullshit speculation on a case-by-case basis:

* ""Sullivan"", being a common Irish surname, is a fairly common Boston toponym, so maybe it's there to differentiate. The Google footprint of ""Sullivan Boston"" seems occupied by Sullivan's South Boston on Castle Island, while ""Sullivan Charleston Boston"" goes to Sullivan's Pub.

* ""Jackson"" is another super common place name, there's Jackson Commons and even more than one Jackson Square.

* ""Union"", in addition to being a not uncommon name for a square, is also the name of an Oyster House, a church, a brunch restaurant, etc...  Far too common a word.

* ""Gilman"" is the name of a street in Boston and a street in Somerville. Also, might be case of it not being a well known square, especially since the area is often subsumed into the better known ""Winter Hill"" neighborhood label.

* ""Magoun"" doesn't have a whole lot to confuse it with.  Might just not be well known.  Seems like leaving off ""Square"" would have been perfectly safe.

* ""Ball"" is just a really short name, the only single-syllable name station name I can think of besides ""State"".  Also, ball being a relatively common everyday name?

"Last time I heard (mainly through reading articles), what was causing delay was the amount of time it took to do the electrical work in the traction power substations. I don't know exactly why that was, but I can remember John Dalton being quoted on something about the means & methods assumptions not being correct. Your guess is as good as mine but I thought that maybe indoor COVID restrictions maybe affected the construction schedule in that regard. I think, though, that now that the Union spur is open, test trains might get started on the Medford branch soon. I think the testing phase takes about three months, so it's possible that we're still on schedule for the ""SPRING/SUMMER 2022"" signs that have been posted on some of the maps.

"GLX was certainly expensive but the comment a few back above really undersells the amount of infrastructure that went into it. It's not simply some new ties, rail, and concrete. If you're ever out in the Inner Belt, you can take a walk around and look at the amount of viaducts, retaining walls, and bridges (more on bridges in a sec) that went into it. That stuff isn't cheap. Add in elevators at every station and you're looking a several million for each, sometimes approaching 8-digits. Then there's all of the signal infrastructure for normal operation of the trains, overhead catenary for the support, the traction power substations (I know of at least two), and an entire vehicle maintenance facility, which also serves as a facility to operators (break room, lockers, offices, etc.). Let's not forget the fact that the program also replaced the Washington Street bridge, the School St bridge, the Medford St bridge, the Ball Square bridge along Broadway, and the Harvard St bridge in Medford. There's likely other stuff I'm leaving out that goes into the stations like comms., emergency/life safety stuff, lighting, etc.

Transit construction is overpriced in the US compared to other places in the world. There's no arguing that. As riders, we'll really only ever see a limited amount of the infrastructure that supports operations.

"As I previously said, I don’t want more unnecessary restrictions that will lead to a major halt in development. I don’t think rent control for example has any impact on housing development.

What I really disagree with is your notion that poor minority residents will be priced out regardless. That is not inevitable! If we implement targeted rent controls and continue to build more dense housing to satiate the young professional desire to move here, the low income community here will be able to stay. Does that require us limiting the profit someone can make on a housing investment by raising rents to match the insane demand? Yes. I’m interested in a solution that keeps the people who’ve been here for years housed. Landlords in this case will make less profit than they could make otherwise, yes. They’ll still make a profit however. Their investment will be a good one, it just won’t be the goldmine it currently is on the backs of people who have the least in our community and many of whom have been here the longest.

You may disagree with that direction and think it punishes those who invested in the housing stock here, but frankly I don’t care.

"It’s simply a fact that rent has gone up disproportionately to wages. 56% of those earning $30,000-$45,000 spend more than half their income on rent. 17% of those earning $45,000-$75,000 spend more than half their income on rent.

If you’d like to go ahead and call that absolutely gigantic percentage of people idiots for spending so much, then I guess go ahead. But when 50%+ of a group of people are making economic decisions like that, there’s usually more going on than everyone being a dumbass. People have little choice but to spend inordinate amounts on rent these days.

I really don’t think it’s so unreasonable that renters like myself are calling for more affordable housing to be built and/or rent prices to be stabilized. If you’re against rent control, then you better be for building more housing. Most landlords are against both because they want to maintain a monopoly on a valuable resource. There’s simply not enough homes anyone can afford anymore for the people who work in and around the city.

People haven’t had their wages increase to match costs, we haven’t built more homes to match demand, and yes therefore people are now calling for rent control because in lieu of those 2 changes, it seems reasonable that rent prices shouldn’t skyrocket on top of that.

I seriously urge you to read more about the issue and talk to actual renters like myself. I work a decent job as recent college grad, I save money and limit my expenses. Still, I don’t see myself ever being able to buy a home anywhere near Somerville or the surrounding area because so much of my income goes to paying my rent.
