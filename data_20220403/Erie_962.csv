"It really depends on the kind of pizza you want.

I like [Stevo's](https://www.stevospizzeria.com) NYC-style cheese pizza because its pretty close to what I grew up with. Thin, floppy crust, oversized slices that you fold, lots of cheese. Its pretty much my ideal pizza, but I know not everyone likes a NYC-style pizza.

There's a lot to be said for [Virgil's Plate](https://sharethesquares.com), too. They do thin-crust, crispy square-cut pizza. Its definitely more ""artisan."" It's probably my second favorite pizza in Erie, but it doesn't travel as well as I'd like. I feel like it's a ""eat it in your car on the curb"" sort of pizza.

"I'm that old and remember it well. It was in 1966 and was reported on the news etc., but it turned out to only be a large dry cleaners bag that someone rigged a lit sterno can inside of to make it float like a hot air balloon. It floated around for a few hours, with people reporting it to police and calling into WJET radio, then came down in an area on the peninsula and burned the side of a tree a little bit. Many stories, (other than the truth) have been concocted about it ever since, just like those of the Axe Murder Hollow folk lore myth. 

These home made UFOs are mentioned on this website, with video instructions on how to make one.

"I mean it's caused by warm temperatures and agricultural runoff, which certainly doesn't get better later on in the year. I stated in my post that it pretty much ramps up steadily through the growing season.

Either you'll stop noticing it, or you won't.

I grew up on the banks of the Allegheny river so that sort of smell doesn't bother me. If you never grew up around water, you're probably not going to be able to ignore the smell so easily. For people around here, they don't notice it, and for people like me who grew up around water, its not that noticeable either.

I'm not the biggest fan of the Erie water's taste, but that's more because of the chlorine which is overpowering because they have to over-chlorinate to prevent zebra muscles from clogging the intake tube in the lake. I put a brita filter on my tap and I can still manage to down 80oz of erie tap water a day.

That seems to suggest that there's probably no on-site security cameras outside of the building, or that management doesn't care.

"If you can get by renting an efficiency apartment (Eg: a room with an attached bathroom, its actually a bit smaller than a studio) you can sometimes score a place for REALLY cheap. You'll need to look on Craigslist (beware of scams) or Facebook Marketplace (probably less scammy, but I haven't tried it) usually. If I was single, that would definitely be the route I would take, as I probably wouldn't be home much beyond sleeping. 

Studios can actually be a bit pricey in Erie for some reason, but there are sometimes 1br that roll up for pretty cheap. You'll definitely have way better luck finding something affordable if you rent from a single owner than something like something owned by a larger property management company. Pretty much anything owned by a larger property management company goes for at \*least\* market rate, if not quite a bit more.

Good luck, I definitely have been in the ""I don't have money but I need my own place"" boat before.

"Unless they changed in the last 8 years it was not terribly cheap OR decent when I lived there. We had constant infestations of house millipedes in every part of the building (the laundry rooms were the worst, by far) every single one of our appliances broke while we were there and they took forever to fix them (and they just... never fixed the dishwasher,) and it was noisy and filthy.

They billed water + sewage + garbage quarterly at a rate that I would assume would have been much higher than what it would have cost had we actually paid them out of pocket.

We also had carpet in our bathroom + carpet in our kitchen, which is like... Yikes.

"You'll need to do the driving, but I cannot recommend At-A-Boy Moving Labor Services enough. They're local to the area.

Seriously they were amazing. They came in with dollies, mats (to prevent ruining carpets), plenty of that movers cellophane. They had my entire apartment loaded into a truck in under 45 minutes and had everything unloaded in about an hour and a half (more stairs at the new place.)

They also do packing services, which I didn't take advantage of, but I may do when I move the next time, just because it seems so much easier to let them handle it all.

They were really polite and funny the entire time. Nothing got damaged, including the super narrow hallways at my new place, which I think is saying something.

If you do call them, tell them Amber and her dad Andy sent you -- I don't get a referral fee, we just had a joke that he'd hire my dad to be his driver any day.

"The previous poster isn't wrong though (even though they're being confrontational about it). Take a look at what's going on with the Erie School District because of suburban flight. It's going to affect downtown, businesses and the city whether or not you want to accept it. 

That being said you can't really make too many arguments against working from home/remote. It has been better for productivity, and the well-being of employees. It also benefits the employer because it expands the pool of potential employees. 

I personally believe that this was the direction we were heading in the future anyway, but covid accelerated that before we as a society were ready for it. So to completely dismiss valid concerns is wrong, but to ignore the benefits of remote work is good either.

"+1 for Dr. Levin. He did my LASIK in 2016 and it was the best thing I ever did for myself. He's extremely professional. I think he said he's been doing LASIK for like, over 20 years. Only had 1 unsuccessful outcome because the person didn't follow the antibiotic protocol. (You HAVE to follow the post procedure instructions... but like, duh. If you don't that's on you) If I ever need touchups for any reason (which so far my vision has been perfect with zero issues) I would only go to Levin.

"So because there are bad scooter or bike riders, these guys shouldn't get a scooter or a bike?

I'm not sure I follow here -- if they're bad drivers in general, getting a car in place of a bike is not going to make them better drivers. It just means when they fuck up they're going to fuck up worse.

Further, do you not realize the vast number of idiots in cars every day, all across the city, the state, the country? I was a commercial truck driver for a year. I know what the fuck I'm talking about; people in cars are often suicidal goddamn morons. Half the time on the road was not ""leisurely driving"", it was watching people think I can stop and turn on a dime in a vehicle that can turn theirs into a pancake with human sauce inside, and trying to mitigate the stupidity of their actions.

More to the point, at another time in my life, I rode an e-bike to work in traffic on the east side of Erie for a good six months, including some of winter (that was exactly as fun for me as you think it was). This was after I was a commercial driver, and I consider myself a good driver -- clean MVR, all that jazz. I used hand signals, obeyed lights, and didn't do anything on a bike that I wouldn't do in a car.

You don't notice good bike riders because they, like good car drivers, are invisible -- not in the sense they don't make themselves seen, but in the sense they are just another predictable vehicle. So telling OP ""just get a car"" isn't going to make them a better driver, nor does it make any goddamn sense when you've got confirmation bias coming out your ears. I'm sorry you have to deal with idiots on the roadway, but so does everyone else -- they ride scooters, bikes, motorcycles, drive cars, hell sometimes even other truck drivers I've seen do dumb shit. That's just the hazard of being on the road. It's not fun for any of us, but singling out bikes and scooters is just dumb.",t2_cwso5,Archonet,0,1647721002.0,0,t1_i1bkm5f,i1bkm5f,False,PackImpossible4210,t3_th5oxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erie/comments/th5oxw/escooter_enforcement/,E-Scooter Enforcement?,/r/Erie/comments/th5oxw/escooter_enforcement/i1bkm5f/,3,r/Erie,0,3

"What are your own legitimate pros and cons about Erie?

*  I am a lifer, and I legit love this town.    
What is the best way to find rental units, I know there aren‚Äôt many online and you‚Äôd have to see them in person. I considered having someone apartment hunt for me before I come  
 
* I'm not sure.  
What are the best neighborhoods and what areas would you suggest to avoid moving into or working in?
* Erie gets bad press, but IMO I think it's a really safe place.  I live in west county now, but I've also lived in the city.    
I have been looking at the following neighborhoods? (Not sure if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd call them) Erie, Milcreek, Harborcreek, Fairview, North East, and Edinboro. Can you tell me about any of them or if you recommend them
* Fairview is expensive.  I'm not a fan of Edinboro.  I live in Springfield on the lake.  Greatest place I've ever lived.  I've also lived in Lake City (AKA: North Girard) I lived in Erie a few minutes from Hamot.  It was OK, I'm just not a city girl.  I always felt comfortable IN erie though.

"Dating apps like Tindr have definitely damaged the fabric of society and I think people are realizing this and moving away from them. The algorithms are not your friend. Facebook is not making your life better.

I moved back to Erie right before the pandemic and that move essentially ended two serious romantic relationships (simultaneous) I had been in. The pandemic was a great time to go sober and be with myself. I'm 31 and definitely don't shy away from dates and potential relationships but I've been ""on the apps"" twice in the past three years for about three days at a time and I don't actively seek out a partner. The craving to ""not be alone"" is something to sit with and meditate on, in my experience, and it's only helped me (even when I get to a point of like, well, c'mon, you NEED some physical touch right now and some close emotional connection).

I have started going to some indoor events, but still wary as masks are pretty much out the window and I look real cool being the loner wearing a N95 (another wave is upon us already, apparently, just wait a couple weeks if the signal from Europe remains true).

A large movie theater space with decent ventilation sounds interesting. I'm also hoping to get into beach volleyball, a cycling or hiking club, or something active like that. The winter surfing thing was appealing to me, but didn't have time to get into it this year. When you don't drink, the limited social options become a little more limited (I love darts and pool but don't really want to play in a dingy bar with smokers and drunks).

"i mean maybe because i'm gay this seems like a weird blanket statement but like i feel like asking someone to exhibit ""strong character"" ""individualism"" and ""intelligence"" seems odd. Like none of those things are particularly quantifiable. 

Intelligence how? Like good grades? Like worldliness? Outdoorsmanship? Street smarts? I tend to want to throttle the ever-loving shit out of people who think they're the smartest person in the room, I can't fucking stand poindexters.

Individualism how? Clothing? Idealism? Physical appearance? I know a shit ton of women who are attracted to white guys with brown hair who go like 165 and are 5'11 and I couldn't pick them up out of a lineup, but I'm told they're like, conventionally attractive. They all seem like shitty sports dorks to me, but that seems like catnip to a certain type of girl.

Character? How do you define character. Good will toward others? Business prowess? Shrewdness? Assertiveness? Thoughtfulness? 

&#x200B;

These are like, indefinable traits that you read in self-help books that don't mean anything.

I think the real argument is that people just like what they like, and for some people that's as basic as ""oh he's got big arms and a square jaw and he can bench press double my weight"" or as specific as ""he is the foremost expert on flesh eating bacteria and he's read every book Jack Kerouac has ever put out."" 

I mean, my type is a tall bitch who can make me laugh and leans hard left politically, and I am grossed out by jingoism and people who think they're better than people who work wage positions in retail/food service.

"You can get land [pretty cheap](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Erie_PA/type-land) in Erie provided you don't need massive acreage. The expensive lot shit comes in when you want to connect to public utilities if your plot isn't already set up for it because the property was razed whatever. And all that shit needs permits, too.

Also a 1500sqft ranch costs more than building a 1500sqft home with an additional floor. Building out is always more expensive than building up. I'm not sure what most ""lists"" out there consider when they calculate it, but when I was in drafting school they always pointed out that ranch homes are more expensive to build.

The benefit of a ranch-style home is that you can actually build smaller square footage and it will feel bigger, because you're not wasting space on stairs and the such. Also its easier to combine spaces in a single-story home because of the open layout.

There's a TON to think about wrt home layout, and a lot of it will really change the price points you're going to be put in.

Like other people have pointed out, it really depends on what you want in the house. Bathrooms and kitchens are more expensive to build than bedrooms and living rooms. So if you have a 3 bedroom house with 2.5 bathrooms and one of those big-ass kitchens its more expensive than 4 bedroom 1.5 bathroom house with a galley kitchen.

And then of course you have fit-and-finish stuff that you need to take in account. Appliances, flooring, light switches, ceiling lights, etc. All these little things that \*really\* nickel-and-dimes up the project in the final stretch.

It also seems like building supplies are way tf up right now. I just helped my dad reno his 50 year old kitchen + laundry room (in a house that was built in the 1800s) and he said that he was glad he got the drywall for the kitchen when he did (November 2019,) because he paid nearly twice for what he needed to do the laundry (October 2021) which is a room that is only a tiny bit larger. That seems like it would be pretty pricy to do a whole house in one shot.

Renovation is always a pain in the ass, but if you can get a decent home (no foundation problems, preferably no K&T electrical etc) in an area you like, its comparatively cheaper to modify an existing home. I know its not as glamorous as the concept of building your own home, but it is something to consider.",t2_151xiz,astroillogica,0,1647396025.0,0,t1_i0tz9dn,i0tz9dn,True,sparta981,t3_tf0bm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erie/comments/tf0bm2/building_a_home_in_erie/,Building a home in Erie,/r/Erie/comments/tf0bm2/building_a_home_in_erie/i0tz9dn/,1,r/Erie,0,1

"A memory of Children's Palace from the 80s...

My mom took my brother and me there so we could use our allowance money to each buy a toy. As we got out of the car and walked across the parking lot, a kid tripped stepping up over the curb and dropped this huge bag of change he was carrying. Quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies went everywhere. My brother and I started to help the kid pick up all the dropped change. There was a LOT! After a few minutes the kid's parent thanked us for helping and said we could keep whatever was left on the ground and took the kid inside the store (hopefully gave the kid money to replace what was dropped).

So my brother and I spent another ten minutes or so gathering up the rest of the coins and we each ended up with a couple extra dollars to spend in the store.

"I would agree with this. When I moved here a year ago from philly I had never even heard of the city Erie. Our first plan being that we'd live here temporarily was to find a condo to buy downtown. As we started looking into the city/market we realized Erie never had an urban renaissance like most of the country following 2010. That led us into looking at houses in the area. Buying a house here did still suck, but mostly because the lack of new construction. I wasn't willing to live in anything built before 2010 and quickly had to push that back a decade and search for houses built after 2000. Ended up with a house built in 2004 and out in Millcreek.

Fairview had some new construction but we didn't want to live that far out of town, and most of the houses built in the early 2000s still have finishes and styling that the rest of the country got rid of in the mid to late 90s.",t2_76h1z,JoshS1,0,1647019327.0,0,t1_i09hoju,i09hoju,False,JoshS1,t3_tbsc63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erie/comments/tbsc63/erie_makes_top_10_on_a_list_that_isnt_bad/,Erie makes top 10 on a list that isn't bad!,/r/Erie/comments/tbsc63/erie_makes_top_10_on_a_list_that_isnt_bad/i09hoju/,10,r/Erie,0,10

"Pros: the food in Erie (at locally owned businesses) is actually pretty good, they have some good bars (for the size of the city) and have a really good attraction in Presque Isle (which is a unique geological formation and is a smaller version of Long Point over in Canada), and a pretty decent amusement park in Waldameer & Water World (Splash Lagoon is ok). 

Cons: The winters can be brutal with the amount of snow the area is prone to receiving. You, coming from the NYC area, can and will likely get bored very quickly (though you can take a 2 hour trip to either Buffalo, Cleveland, or Pittsburgh - all these cities have something unique to offer).

Areas to avoid would really be the Eastside of Erie, north of E. 26th that ranges from State St to Franklin Ave (Erie's Eastside boundary), and the Westside, North of W.26th that ranges from Cherry St. over to Greengarden Blvd. Everywhere else is actually pretty safe. But best areas are Harborcreek, Millcreek, North East, Fairview, and Edinboro

Harborcreek and North East are Eastside suburbs and are mostly rural. You'll have plenty of space in those two areas. Millcreek is where everyone who has some money but doesn't want to live 20 minutes away from Erie, lives. Edinboro is a college town and very affluent (for Erie, anyways). Probably would recommend Millcreek as that would make commuting and staying around shops and things more accessible.

The closer you get to downtown, the worse things get. The upper east side is especially rough. But you could probably survive anywhere. There are a lot of old Victorian houses being rented out. I have some friends who rent big old houses like these, in crummier areas of the city.

I was able to buy a 1950s house in Erie a couple years ago. I couldn't afford a home in Millcreek. Close to downtown is too scary for me, but I could've bought a much bigger house in those areas.

As far as being similar I think it's kind of like white plains with a little bit of ghetto square thrown in. It has one decent sized downtown area on the waterfront, but gets very suburb quickly.

Edit: to clarify I mean it's similar in my opinion to Getty square in that there are several restaurants and things to do on the waterfront.

Similar to white plains as the main downtown section can be fairly busy but tapers into suburb-like housing pretty quickly.

"Here's a Pros/Cons list I put in another thread here.

Pros:

* It's cheap (Cost of Living) like everything. Cocktails under $10, craft/import beers ~$6. Easy to have a full dinner for 2 under $100.
* Housing costs are also very low.
* The airport is stupid easy.
* No traffic.
* Presque Isle is really nice with exception of peak tourist times.
* It's close to Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh.
* Erie has both OHL, and MiLB sports teams for year around sports entertainment and games are stupid cheap.
* It's small, nothing around town is far.
* People are nice and generally mean well.
* Parking is free, or cheap enough it doesn't matter. Downtown garages run like $2/hr
* Summer weather is terrific!

Cons:

* Very limited dining options.
* Very limited flights, CLT (AA) and OHR (UA) is all you get now.
* Uber is extremely unreliable and doesn't offer ""Uber Black""
* It's small.
* People drive insanely conservative. Guessing about 80% of the time I can't go to the grocery store without getting stuck on a road behind someone driving 5-10mph under the speed limit on clear and dry roads. They stop for like 3 seconds minimum at stop sings when there's no other traffic and generally just are always in the way. It's a constant annoyance.
* There's limited options for anything you can think of. I still haven't found a decent car wash service with a schedulable full car detail service. (yes I tried Delta Sonic, they corporate and they kind of suck).
* My wife has yet to find anyone competent enough to do her hair/nails correctly and after a year has resigned to just scheduling trips back to Philly.
* Population generally skews old, with a very small young professional population or I just haven't been able to find where they all go.

"I would avoid north east and edinboro for the simple fact that they‚Äôre pretty far (relatively speaking) from the city. I would recommend harborcreek or millcreek as the best places to live as they‚Äôre pretty nice and close proximity to everything.

People that complain that there is nothing to do are honestly just boring people.

There‚Äôs plenty of breweries and bars around, and a ton of wineries to visit. There‚Äôs the amusement park and water park, pool halls and bowling alleys, axe throwing places, etc. 

In the winter, Peek n Peak is great for snowboarding and skiing and is relatively close. Holiday valley in NY is three hours away, but worth the trip if you like skiing/snowboarding. I believe there‚Äôs some ice skating places as well.

"Short-term, depending on what services you provide, freelancing might be an option to both keep some cash flowing in and to boost your skillset / reputation.  [Upwork.com](https://Upwork.com), [Fiverr.com](https://Fiverr.com) and [Freelancer.com](https://Freelancer.com) all are pretty heavily used around the world so you might find stuff there.

I'm wondering if Gannon's iHack program might be a good place to look?  I don't know of any jobs there open right now, but if you've got the experience viable there, I'm happy to pass your resume over to them.  Edinboro has a different flavor of IT (they do a lot of computer graphic animation work over there) if that's more your cup of tea.

Just from what you've written about, I'd also check with the City of Erie, maybe Sisters of St. Joe's, possibly the school districts and/or IU5 too.  Depending on what the circumstances are, they may either have leads or needs -- I don't know of any off the top of my head, but don't mind asking if you think any are a good fit (DM me if you'd like, I'm happy to help).

Sounds like the situation you're emerging from sucked.  Long-term probably a good separation if they're upset about something you did 6+ years ago (again, I don't know what you did but you make it sound more like keying a car than murder).  With the job market how it is, shouldn't be a huge setback even though I'm sure it stung for a bit too.

I recently pulled my old Super Nintendo out and alas, it doesn‚Äôt work. After opening the unit up, it‚Äôs clear some of the capacitors have gone bad. Brown hardened ooze under most of them.

For some reason, people in the city are obsessed with setting off fireworks in the warm weather. It's a nightly thing. I mention this because you have a dog and people have no regard that they're scaring poor animals all summer.

"It's a terrible market here. Well, I suppose if you can buy over 500k then you might be okay, if not you are SOL.

The houses that have been 'fixed up' are totally overpriced for this area.

There is one that went on the market last week. Standard three bedroom 2 bath single story.  The interior and exterior were redone (new dry wall and laminate wood floors), looks like new windows and updated heating/cooling. I actually watched daily as the redo was being done.  Probably took two weeks (give or take winter weather) which means it's a flip.  I checked the records for it (one *can* do it easily). It was sold  late 2021 for under 70k. The house is listed at almost $300k! NO effin way there is almost two hundred thou in upgrades, maybe another $70k, at most (including flipping labor). NO appliances included, there isn't even a porch or decking. It's a standard flip. Cheaply done but nice aesthetics. It sits on almost an acre (parcel isn't very wide but long). I know someone will pay close to that asking price. It's crazy.

I have a relative looking for almost a year for something decent. They are actually thinking of transferring through work to a different location just to be able to buy. I'm afraid to say Erie has seen better days.

Some thoughts: I think a vegan restaurant in Erie should not be advertised as such.

Consider partnering with another vegan restaurant outside the area. Preferably one who you won't be sharing customers with, to eliminate competition.

That might not be necessary if you are skilled in developing an online reputation.

"A fully vegan restaurant would be awesome, and my family and I would certainly frequent it!

I think the pitfalls (for me personally) would be two things:

1. Vegan food doesn't have to be boring. There's so much more available than salads, sandwiches, and soups. Too many places that try for a vegan menu are just so.. plain. I want flavor. And I want a meal, not a snack. Vegan food can be delicious and filling.

2. Not all vegan food has to be the vegan version of a mainstream food. Things like vegan burgers, lasagna, meatloaf, etc can be great to have on the menu for people who maybe aren't sure what to order or don't usually eat vegan. But veganized ""normal"" food shouldn't be the entire menu. Instead of trying to replace or recreate things, just make tasty dishes. There's also a certain risk that comes along with drawing the comparison; someone that eats a mainstream diet who orders vegan barbecue isn't going to like it because it doesn't taste like meat barbecue, and may conclude that vegan food sucks. Does that make sense? If you want your vegan food to be appealing to the masses, just make it taste good. Don't try to recreate nonvegan dishes.

"I would definitely eat at an all-vegan place. I think a lot of non-vegans would go there if the food was good enough. My favorite all-vegan (or almost) restaurant I've ever been to is the Zenith Diner in Pittsburgh and it's always packed. My preference for a vegan restaurant would be to see a brunch/lunch place because all the diners around here are awful for vegans. I want vegan waffles ffs! For lunch/dinner options I'd love to see a place serving comfort food or classic homestyle recipes.

"Note: I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I eat meat maybe 1-3 times a month at most -- usually when I go out to eat because there aren't a ton of non-meat options I can eat (I can't eat lettuce, avocado, eggs, or mushrooms, which means that salads, omelettes, and a lot of vegetarian options at non-vegetarian restaurants are out.) 

I would absolutely be down for a vegan or vegetarian option \*because\* of how little meat I eat. I don't have a ton of options as it stands. I don't represent erie as a whole, obviously, though, so I do suggest doing some research. 

I'd argue that I personally don't want anything asian because a lot of asian places already have some decent vegetarian or vegan options, so there'd be some overlap. 

A sandwich place would be kinda good because a lot of options at places like Jimmy Johns or Subway are just ""a salad on bread"" when I'd really want something more like a grilled pepper + eggplant, or a vegan banh mi option. Something more substantial than what is on offer currently.

I also feel like a vegan soul food or americana place could do well. Especially with college kids if you did it down in the Gannon area, where you'd be a bit more likely to run into vegetarians and vegans. I don't know a lot of vegans who would turn down a good veggie burger + side of Mac & Cheez.

 Downtown may be your best bet for location, something below 14th street in the State/Peach/French area, though it might not be bad to scope out west erie near the entrance to presque isle (sort of the juice jar area, I suppose.)

"Pros:

* It's cheap (Cost of Living) like everything. Cocktails under $10, craft/import beers ~$6. Easy to have a full dinner for 2 under $120.
* Housing costs are also very low.
* The air port is stupid easy.
* No traffic.
* Presque Isle is really nice with exception of peak tourist times.
* It's close to Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh.
* Erie has both OHL, and MiLB sports teams for year around sports entertainment and games are stupid cheap.
* It's small, nothing around town is far.
* People are nice and generally mean well.
* Parking is free, or cheap enough it doesn't matter. Downtown garages run like $2/hr
* Summer weather is terrific!

Cons:

* Very limited dining options.
* Very limited flights, CLT (AA) and OHR (UA) is all you get now.
* Uber is extremely unreliable and doesn't offer ""Uber Black""
* It's small.
* People drive insanely conservative. Guessing about 80% of the time I can't go to the grocery store without getting stuck on a road behind someone driving 5-10mph under the speed limit on clear and dry roads. They stop for like 3 seconds minimum at stop sings when there's no other traffic and generally just are always in the way. It's a constant annoyance.
* There's limited options for anything you can think of. I still haven't found a decent car wash service with a schedulable full car detail service. (yes I tried Delta Sonic, they corporate and they kind of suck).
* My wife has yet to find anyone competent enough to do her hair/nails correctly and after a year has resigned to just scheduling trips back to Philly.
* Population generally skews old, with a very small young professional population or I just haven't been able to find where they all go.
