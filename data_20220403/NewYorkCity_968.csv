"1. People have been writing about that. 
2. You all make a shit ton of money. Stop trying to compare your situation to overworked, underpaid government employees. 
3. This isn't a scary article, it's an extremely fair and unbiased expose on why 10% of  employees left amidst a crime wave in the city, including laws that were enacted and the reasons behind them. 
4. If your privilege prevents you from seeing how this will be a problem for the everyday citizens of New York who want to see a functioning law system, then you move along. A huge part of the reason why we have so many cases plead guilty is because of the workload of both the prosecution and defense. A huge part of the reason people are spending months or years in jail awaiting trial is because of the caseload to worker ratio that makes trail dates unfeasibly long. A huge part of the reason a lot of crime is being committed by repeat offenders (like the man who pushed a woman on the train tracks last month) is cases are getting dropped because of exactly these kinds of situations.   
It's always rich tech people who work remote with cushy salaries who take this indignant attitude towards the justice system. You act like you're liberal when in reality you're the privileged one who will just leave for another city or neighborhood when the crime actually gets really bad and talk about the right for workers to earn better pay while acting completely callous to prosecutors demanding the same.

"Hard to say without knowing what motivated the shooter but let's run through some ideas.

First, making guns harder to get and easier to track. 

Looking past that, let's say this was drug related.  Decriminalization and the funding of treatment programs would lessen demand. 

If it was gang OR drug related, work programs, free education and community resource spending would create opportunities for young black men to enter society.

I was out TODAY in Brooklyn,  gathering signatures for a candidate and MULTIPLE people told me that there son had just turned 18 and was desperately looking for work.  

Also mental health resources. A lot of violence is about untreated mental health disorders. 

Obviously,  I don't know if the shooter had been to prison but odds are pretty good they have, in which case it is possible that more prison rehabilitation (prison to work programs and mental health) as well as better work release programs could have helped them.

We think of the shooter as a villain ans while that's true, they might also be the product of a system more focused on punishment than on prevention.

Is the fintech situation people leaving in droves but new people also coming in in droves? Or do you mean where you work pays less than other places so people leave in droves (and aren't replaced)? The sense I get about the prosecutor situation is people are leaving and not being replaced because no one wants the job at the current pay/workload level.

"(Cross-posting this response to the three redundant threads....)  I'd like to think most people can see multiple sides to this controversial issue, and maybe how it reflects a key question of how our democracy functions.  As stated in the article, ""the park was a hotbed of ideas, of people coming together outside to share music and art,"" - which remains true and is one of the reasons this park is the heart of real NYC.  But some of the complaints are legitimate, like tearing up the lawns, graffiti (besides the many clever chalk messages), occasional violence, and probably more. I've been there several nights every week for the last nine months, and witnessed violence only once, and it was appropriately handled by the cops.

The invoking of a 10PM curfew last year was inexcusably wrong.  I think most people I know would not object to midnight. And there was a long period last year when cops allowed amplified music without permit, as long as it was moderate and turned off amplification at 10.  That was a very rational balance. One of the solutions would be if permits were easier to obtain. I seriously wonder if the Conservancy would be willing to advise/assist. (I doubt it, but maybe.)  This article on a well-known park dancer exemplifies the general imbalance and ridiculousness of most of the restrictions: [https://www.curbed.com/2021/09/kanami-kusajima-dancer-washington-square-nypd.html](https://www.curbed.com/2021/09/kanami-kusajima-dancer-washington-square-nypd.html) .  But ideal if we all could consider all sides. I spoke to a folk guitarist last week about making a petition to allow more amplification.  But though he often joins the jam band ensemble, he actually prefers when there are maybe 6 to a dozen separate acoustic music circles that don't get drowned out by the  amps.  He agreed the major celebration that a good amplified band can bring was positive, with dancing etc. But the point is balance and consideration. (Hard to legislate not being an asshole.) 

As for the skateboarders, they mostly police themselves and almost never cause actual issues.   I've read about two actual collisions, but have never witnessed a single one. Many people who don't understand that culture feel anxious about them and seek to ban them.  The ideal scenario is during the cold months when they take over the fountain ring and people sit on the barrier around them.  In that situation, their positive spirit thrives without having to worry about anxious pedestrians. I wish the Conservancy or city could create a designated skatepark area, but there's not unlimited space, so probably not practical.  

Finally, as for drugs... it's just incorrect to think that drugs are the primary activity. You can't miss their presence, but it's a fraction of what goes on. Now selling cannabis products are legal here,  though those people act in a grey area due to permits not yet being available. Cannabis has never been a problem (and I'm not a consumer who's defending it.)  Crack, meth, heroin etc, have obvious impact beyond the people selling and using. (I hope that's obvious to everyone.) I'm in favor of treating them as a sociological issue, but nonetheless, *treating them.* Several times in the past year, the cops have done a good job minimizing or even eliminating that element without resorting to fascist riot-gear-type tactics.",t2_mske9dy,N7777777,0,1649008836.0,0,t1_i3902zu,i3902zu,True,psychothumbs,t3_tt7raf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/tt7raf/mission_creep_emails_show_how_wealthy_donors/,Mission creep: Emails show how wealthy donors exerted influence over Washington Square Park,/r/nyc/comments/tt7raf/mission_creep_emails_show_how_wealthy_donors/i3902zu/,1,r/nyc,0,1

">	I for one couldn’t give a shit anymore because if NYC wants less policing then let’s have it.


That’s the point. NYC doesn’t want less police. Privileged white kids who only care about internet points want less police. People that have to live in high crime areas don’t support the “defund the police” rhetoric. 

Redditors are so incredibly out of touch with reality, then call black people stupid for disagreeing with them. 

Sure, less police in Williamsburg and Murray Hill won’t cause any issues. Less police in Brownsville will.

"The Illuminator team who did have a rather large projector and a can w/ a generator, but it can be done on a smaller scale.

Cheap used projectors can be found on eBay. Long throw lenses are harder to come by but some  results can be had with standard throw lenses. In sourcing a projector go for as many lumens as you can afford from a reputable projector brand (Panasonic, Christie) I’d say absolute minimum viable Lumen count for a building is 6000 lumens. But higher is better. 

Gasoline generators will give you more bang for your buck than batteries, and most lipo battery bank “solar generators” do’t have enough power to run a large projector. 

Large projectors and generators are heavy so you need a vehicle and a partner or two. 

The last piece I’d recommend is a burner computer with no personal info on it. Software such as madmapper or resolume will allow you to do digital keystone and warping to make it easier to project from extreme angles. 

But digital projections aren’t the only way, a stage light with a long throw lens can project a image cut into sheet metal (called a gobo) for something slightly more portable. 

Or you can DIY a 35mm slide projector.  A nice handheld projection cannon can be made with a 200mm camera lens with a nice wide open aperture, a 3D printed slide holder, and a high powered light source. I’d recommend a 100w COB led chip with a condensing lens and cooling.  This can fit in a backpack and easily hit the top of a dark building, but you can only use for a minute or so at a time before the slides start to melt from the light.

The illuminator have some good resources as well.

"First off, there are *plenty* of not-rich progressives, including POCs and immigrants of every stripe. I work with them all the time. However the mayoral campaign just happened to have multiple progressive candidates whose campaigns imploded or never really got off the ground. If any of them had been not awful or not alleged sexual harassers, etc. you might have seen a real challenger to Adams emerge. The point being that every election cycle is different, and the peculiarities of individual candidates can be hard to  parse out from policy differences. I guarantee you that there are lots of low-information voters who thought Adams was progressive because he is Black, and voted for him because by the end of the race, he remained the only candidate with a high profile and some level of name recognition. 

Second, there is a large cohort of politically active voters, many of them older, who got engaged during an earlier era of NYC politics when navigating and becoming beholden to the borough machines was a prerequisite for running for office.  The POC, and particularly the Black electeds who came up through these machines were heroes to their supporters for succeeding within an opaque and often racist good old boy system. There are lots of these types floating around NYC. They have large, powerful formal and informal networks of support that they can mobilize and people who have just been reflexively checking their names on ballots for decades. They tend to be very good at getting $$ to their constituents, keeping unions happy, and staying in office. And not much else. They’re pretty uniformly not the sharpest, totally visionless, and incapable of taking a stand on anything that’s really transformative in any direction, progressive or otherwise. Eric Adams is one of these. 

People don’t vote based on adding up all the policy proposals that candidates make during the campaign and then choosing the ones that are “best for them.” It’s just not an accurate or illuminating way to think about voting.",t2_3jczck00,reddituserperson1122,0,1648992335.0,0,t1_i37yfns,i37yfns,False,Kamuka,t3_tuqmvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/tuqmvo/projection_on_building/,Projection on building,/r/nyc/comments/tuqmvo/projection_on_building/i37yfns/,3,r/nyc,0,3

You're off to a bad start already though. You got too many demands for someone who just graduated high school and doesn't have any skills. Without any skills, there aren't too many high paying jobs that would allow you to live in an apartment by yourself.

Two ways you can approach this:

1. Look at the area you want to live in and get an idea of rent. From there start to calculate what kind of income you'd need to have and look for jobs that would pay that much.

2. Find a job and then look for an apartment that fits your income and needs.

Given you have no credit and no skills or even a job, I'm not even sure you'll be able to get an apartment yourself. There's typically a credit check landlords do before renting to someone.

"He hasn't *done* a whole lot besides get tougher on homeless people

but a lot of people don't like what he has *indicated* he'll do or how he's indicated he'll do it

what irked me right off the bat was when he made some comments about solitary confinement of prisoners, and he ended it by saying something along the lines of ""I'm a cop for twenty years, I know how to handle prisoners best"" or something like that

but like... being a cop does not give unique and unquestionable authority and perspective on how to treat prison inmates. That is not what their job is, that is not what they are trained for.

Which indicates *to me* that he has decided his opinion should be absolute *simply by virtue of being a cop*, whether that is relevant to the task at hand or not.

That is *troubling*, and what's more is it confirms *exactly* what I was afraid of-- that he would consider his *opinions* unilaterally correct and beyond reproach, without bothering to verify outside his ""gut feeling"" that they are indeed the correct decisions.

He has similarly shown favoritism to the police and their current methods of enforcement (and their *desires* on how to enforce) in a time when the city is *very* divided on how the police should be handling things.

He's also hired in his brother to a high-paying job as head of his security, which to some felt like nepotism. (I believe his salary was later reduced to $1, but if I don't mention it here people will be up in arms anyway because it was a whole thing)

As for what he's done *before* his time as mayor and what he advocated for, that's a lot longer conversation. But it's still fairly early in his career as mayor so there's not a lot of substance for what he's *actually* done as mayor, besides what I mentioned above.

Side Note: Talk about how impossible it was to run during a pandemic. I dropped out when the NY State Court ruled that all candidates must get 2,500 in-person signatures to be on the ballot. I suffer from an underlying condition and there was no way that I could meet people one on one. Also, if the average Joe decides to run for mayor, the city tries to get you to withdraw at every moment. And don't even get me started on matching funds.

"Seriously? For your information, I am in a DOMESTIC ABUSE SHELTER. Guess what happens when your ex beats the crap out of you over and over again and there is no way out except to go to a domestic abuse shelter because he is taking every single penny you make and both of you are on the lease except you are the only person working and attempting to pay bills? They make you QUIT YOUR JOB and FIND A NEW JOB. But, they only give you 90 days to do so then you are OUT ON THE STREETS. You know why they only give you 90 days to find a job and find a place? Because funding has been cut. I've put in job application after job application. Do you know how hard it is to find a job when you have NO ADDRESS to put down because you can't put down the shelter address you are at because the location isn't suppose to be known? They also don't let you even give your job a two weeks notice, they make you quit right when you go into the shelter. So that's a bad remark on your last job when you are doing applications. Do you know how hard it is to find a place after you had to just dip out of your apartment for safety reasons? Most landlords don't care. You still abandoned a lease. Also, having to quit all of the sudden means you don't have the money to pay a electric bill or even pay the rent that is due on an apartment you can't go back to. So what was I suppose to do? Stay in a abusive relationship until he KILLED me? The last night he put hands on me he bashed my face into the wall and broke my nose, his goal was to bash in my face into the wall hard enough to cause a seizure ( I have epilepsy) and then kill me and blame it on a seizure. So if I can't find a job or an apartment fast enough before my time is up at the shelter and I have to go live on the streets or sleep in a subway station, I should get arrested because it makes you uncomfortable? So my choices to make people like you not feel uncomfortable is go back to my abusive ex so he can kill me or sit in jail? Tell me, do I make you uncomfortable that I am alive and breathing the same air as you? Are you really that much of a pr!¢k that my existence is that unsettling for you? Do you wish that my ex just killed me so that I couldn't seek safety at a shelter and breath the same air as you? Do I deserve to not live because you feel soooooooooo uncomfortable? 


I really hope one day you go through a hard time, lose EVERYTHING, and become homeless. I hope you can't receive help ANYWHERE and try to seek a little bit of sleep somewhere and get arrested for trying to sleep in a park or something.

"If I had to guess, probably something to do with Adams being a former NYPD Captain whose mission as mayor is to bring back the quality of life New York enjoyed before the crime wave from the pandemic and de Blasio (which was reinforced by policies enacted in the name of progressivism), and in doing so will be accused of being an oppressor like Giuliani and Bloomberg, despite the city benefitting.

EDIT: This subreddit hates cops, loves homeless in the subway, loves random street attacks, and apparently hates safety and a first world standard of living. All the talk in these comments about how Adams barely won and it's barely a mandate from the people -- good, this thread is proof that the people of NYC have zero business in having any say in how the city is run because the people clearly hate themselves and their fellow citizens.

"I don't think too much of the new mayor but he is  offering the homeless he is displacing a place to go. They just don't want to go there.

I get it. For five years plus I was one of them. For over two I slept on the beach and in the subway because I didn't want to give up my older cat, a support animal, to go into a shelter. Having lived in the as shelter system I totally get why the street homeless would rather live under a tarp than take a bed in one. 

Living in two NYC shelters was damn hard and most of the time I hated it. I don't drink, smoke or do drugs. I've never even had a traffic ticket let alone spent time in jail. I do have CPTSD, anxiety and chronic depression but my mental issues are not the reason I can't function well or work anymore. It's the physical issues, injury  and autoimmune disease that make me officially disabled. 

Being in that system with the guards, the scanning machines, the checks for contraband, that to me was a lot like jail. The assumption that I was likely doing something I shouldn't and how I was treated like I was doing something wrong all the time, like I had done something wrong and deserved to be homeless and to be abused for whatever my ""sin"" was that was just a huge part of shelter life. 

Finally having a place, not having to live by stupidly abusive rules it's just heaven compared to that. Honestly until I got too ill again and nearly died I was happier on the streets fending for myself and my cat than I was in the shelter. I still faced plenty of abuse at times but it wasn't heaped on my head like it was in the shelter.  

Because of my physical issues they put me in a shelter with a lot of addicted and very mentally ill people. Vermin, spoiled food, people acting out, getting violent, even some bullying me, it was just all part of daily life in the shelter. 

But it was being in the shelter that enabled me to get out of being homeless. I would not be where I am, housed in my own apartment in NYC, if I had not finally gone into the shelter system. It literally saved my life. 

For many it's the only way into supportive, affordable housing and it's not fair to say that the homeless that are being displaced are not being offered help because they are. It's just that the way that the system is set up getting help usually means going through hell to get it. They either don't want to go there or can't cope with going there. 

I made it out and I'm staying out but for everyone like me there are several more who don't make it and stay out of the system. But I only got out because I finally went into the shelter system, I got disability, and I won the housing lotto. 

I'm extremely grateful to be where I am. I'm safe. I have a roof over my head. I eat okay if not exactly well most of the time. I do have my cat. 
I'm way better off than a lot of people right now. 

But these people are not going to get the help they need living on the streets and if they do have issues, mental issues, physical issues, substance abuse issues the street will eventually eat them alive and they will die. 

I am not a fan of tough love but then again it may be the only way to get some of these people off the streets and it is at this point a necessary evil. There are just too many people suffering and while I am all about helping them while they are on the streets the end game should be shelter and housing not indulging them and allowing the suffering to continue. 

I was wrong to stay out of the shelter system as long as I did. I just loved my cat too much and could not go on without her. I had just lost too much. I could not bear to lose her too. BRC lied to me for quite a while on that. Truth was with a doctor's letter I could have gone with her into a shelter 18 months before I did and maybe ended up housed a lot sooner. 

But in the end I still ended up where I belong albeit I had to nearly die to get here...

I am extremely sympathetic to anyone living homeless but I'm also someone who has lived it and is a realist. The homeless situation in NYC is just going to get even way worse if they don't practically force some of the street homeless into shelters and into getting help. Some of them desperately need it but won't take it and are a danger to themselves and others. 

I mean what's left to do? 

Been there, done that, and I just don't see the kid gloves approach is working too well. I think it's unfortunately necessary to force the issue sometimes. I say that as someone who has lived it and seen it all. Most people they have NO clue as to how bad it can be when you are street homeless. Living like that, like I did, it's just inhumane as hell.",t2_a0obx,mtempissmith,0,1648960122.0,0,t1_i36q5xs,i36q5xs,True,deadwavez,t3_tuzijk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/tuzijk/its_absolutely_horrible_what_eric_adams_is_doing/,"It’s absolutely horrible what Eric Adams is doing in nyc right now.

"I am (or was) a music person. Bands don't typically plan one-off shows, they plan tours (or, more specifically, their booking agents and management plan tours, if they’re at that level of support). Sometimes they are touring an album and may plan the first run of shows in primary markets, places like New York City, Chicago, and DC, seemingly “ignoring” the littler places, but often follow that later with another tour that mixes in secondary and tertiary markets (eg. Buffalo or Albany). And sometimes a tour may be more built around the convenience of routing, so likelier to hit secondary and tertiary markets where they think they can get a good draw and make the stop worth it.
There are also considerations of over-saturation. While some acts could probably play New York City multiple times a year and sell well each time, most acts would have to consider the timing since they last played that market, and may choose a nearby market instead.",t2_olde71v,eggelton,0,1648955301.0,0,t1_i36h9g2,i36h9g2,False,WalkingTalker,t3_tunrek,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/tunrek/ny_democrats_oppose_hochuls_850m_buffalo_bills/,NY Democrats oppose Hochul’s $850M Buffalo Bills stadium ‘giveaway’,/r/nyc/comments/tunrek/ny_democrats_oppose_hochuls_850m_buffalo_bills/i36h9g2/,4,r/nyc,0,4

"Yes, that quote was from the Bible. And while I have everyone's attention, and if the mods will allow, let me speak on something Bible-related that's also a hot topic rn. I know this is off-topic, so I'm not trying to start a whole new thread here. Just something for people to chew on. 

There's a lot of anti-gay legislation being pushed around the country at the moment by conservative Christian factions. But if you look at the full context of the verses that supposedly inspire their stance, the context strongly suggests that it's talking about anal only.

Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 talks about ""a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman"". That was actually a common phrase at the time in many lands and languages, and in other settings, it was usually understood as referring to anal. Plus, the religious practices referred to in the verses featured anal sex as part of the worship. 

Romans 1:26,27 talk about women who ""exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones"". In Jewish parlance (and most early Christians were Jewish), ""natural sexual relations"" referred to vaginal sex. On the other hand, ""unnatural sex"" was penetration in the ""wrong"" hole (the anus). The parallel then drawn between men referred to anal between guys. And again, the verses were talking about religious practices that involved anal. 

In 1 Cor 6:9,10, the Greek word translated as ""men who have sex with men"" (arsenokoiten) was a reference to Leviticus 18:22. The one translated ""effeminate"" or ""male prostitutes"" (malakoi) referred to pagan priests who made themselves anally receptive as part of worship. Again, this was related to contemporary pagan practices. 

We can argue about whether or not this applies today. But I think this would invalidate a lot of Christian homophobia in America. And it's not like enough priests and preachers don't know about this interpretation.

"That budget is extremely flushed with one-time cash though. This isn’t a result of increased sustained revenues or decreased programming. It’s money from the federal infrastructure stimulus.

Honestly, it’s for projects *like* this. One time expenses whose maintenance will not be on government budgets.

I don’t like the stadium proposal one bit but I also get why it’s being proposed right now. Shut it down and replace it with other immediate expenses.

"Long Island does not have low taxes and it smashes the middle class. Just the property tax alone was $1200 or $1400. Yeah, the same as some people's rent. Most schools are good and the crime is nothing like the city. Many people have been Republican through the 70's, 80's, and on because it was always the Democrats that would raise the taxes. I moved out of L.I. because I liked the action of the city, the everything. Truly though, it's become a horrible place to live; very unmanaged for a long time especially under DeBlasio. I've never seen so many seriously mentally ill people on the streets and subways and most smoke ""K-2"". That's a notorious drug for the homeless because you can buy a joint for $1 and be catatonic or a host of other effects. I've seen guys lounging and sleeping on a dirty ground as if it was a king size bed with satin sheets. It's become no place to raise a child. Just going back to L.I. and sitting in your back yard or front steps and it's peaceful and therapeutic. There's not much of that in the city. And then $1800 for a tiny studio I a decent neighborhood ? It's bad news in the city, there's many great places, but it's not safe for everyone including single women and the elderly and that's just unacceptable. I don't fall into the victim category, but the place is still out of control kind of like the Koch era of the 1980's.",t2_c8umkvgb,Designer-Common-9697,0,1648935913.0,0,t1_i35l9yq,i35l9yq,False,Kamuka,t3_tuqmvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/tuqmvo/projection_on_building/,Projection on building,/r/nyc/comments/tuqmvo/projection_on_building/i35l9yq/,-10,r/nyc,0,-10

"Worth clicking, barring the possibility that the facts aren't being accurately represented, it's a good, dense article that covers the important parts like absolute numbers (375k absentee), pre-pandemic rates of absenteeism (26% citywide, with some schools being over 50%, versus 40% citywide), the definition of absenteeism (10% or 18 days of the academic year), and allegations that schools are being pressured to doctor the data. Apparently COVID status isn't contributing to that number either.

> The rate is likely worse because principals say schools were told to mark COVID-stricken or quarantined students present if a teacher or administrator simply made contact with the kids or their parents in an email or phone call.
