"So there's going to be a process of culture shock when you get here since NC has redneck types just about everywhere, but keep in mind they're not all like you see on TV or in movies. Most are friendly, helpful, and great people, though (as with any group) there are some who are not. Once you get here and interact with people, I think you'll be surprised. Expectation can create reality, so be careful,  e.g. - I think New Yorkers are going to be rude, they sense that, so they're rude. 

Concord is a bit bipolar since it's quiet and loud. The part of town to the north and east is quiet and has a hometown atmosphere. There are places to walk, restaurants, events, and churches. Right now there is construction everywhere too. Look on Google Maps at Church St and Cabarrus Ave for an idea of this area, though know that during the week there is heavy traffic here. If you settle around this area -- you might be able to find a big house with land around Mt Pleasant, for instance -- you'll spend a lot of time on Branchview trying to get to town. It's a road that needed to be widened long ago. 

On the other hand, as you go south towards Mecklenberg, you get to Concord Mills, which has heavy traffic, the racetrack, and hotels. Based on NC boards on Reddit, I think I'm safe in saying that those of us from here have come to hate this area since it's so congested and touristy these days. If you settle in this area, you'll see fewer rednecks since this is where many housing developments and country club types seem to be. 

If you go west, you'll get to the edges of Davidson. It's exploded in the past decades, but my friends who live there love it. The stretch of 73 that connects Concord and Davidson might be worth looking at since there are a number of developments there. In this area you'll likely commute to Davidson or Concord Mills for entertainment.

"I don't know a whole lot about Concord, but I live in Kannapolis which is right across I-85 from the hospital. We just got a minor league baseball stadium built downtown which is in walking distance from a brewery, a ciderworks and a local coffee house. We're a lot like Concord, only a bit smaller. From Concord or Kannapolis you'll have plenty of resturants to choose from, and easy access to nightlife in Charlotte (20-30 min drive or you can park near UNCC and take the light rail into downtown to save on parking).

"Concord is growing rapidly thanks in part to Charlotte’s rapid growth. Lots of young couples and families are moving to Concord because they’re priced out of the Charlotte market or just want more space for their money. There’s a lot of development happening downtown and in the established neighborhoods around it as well as lots of new cookie cutter neighborhoods being carved out of our formerly rural areas. Downtown has a few shops and mom and pop restaurants, a barcade, a game store, a cat cafe, a bar, but there isn’t any late night ‘nightlife.’ We have a few breweries around town and one of our old mills is being renovated and will have a food hall and shops. There’s an excellent antique mall there as well. There’s plenty of big chain restaurants, a great (and always growing) selection of local restaurants serving a variety of cuisines. We have excellent Mexican restaurants, some really great Asian options, a couple of Indian places, lots of Italian.
If you are big on concerts, theater, clubs, bar hopping, nightlife etc. you will be driving to Charlotte proper for all of that but it’s only 30 mins or so.
Concord is safe, there’s the usual car break-ins and property crimes that you’d see in any city our size. Most violent crime we experience isn’t random.
Overall we are still a kind of sleepy suburb but there’s lots of growth happening and Charlotte is convenient for big events. We have a bus system but it’s not super convenient, we’re a very car dependent  city.",t2_khxbfus,AdmiralBonesaw,0,1647821309.0,0,t1_i1gx6yx,i1gx6yx,True,DueMood9,t3_tiwg73,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordNC/comments/tiwg73/got_a_job_offer_in_the_area_have_a_few_questions/,"Got a job offer in the area, have a few questions.",/r/ConcordNC/comments/tiwg73/got_a_job_offer_in_the_area_have_a_few_questions/i1gx6yx/,8,r/ConcordNC,0,8
"It depends on what you define as ‘Concord’.

The proper downtown area/ historic area/ Union street is fine. It’s like any other small town- a handful of restaurants, the library, shops, courthouse, law offices, connections to the greenway, etc…

They’re building a ton of new apartments downtown but it remains to be seen if they’ll actually fill out the downtown area with more shops/ attractions in the coming years. 

Otherwise, it’s just another suburb of Charlotte- you’ll be driving into Charlotte for any major attractions and traffic is only getting worse.

Edit:

FWIW, when I visit for the holidays, all the neighborhoods downtown appear to be turning over- lots of late 20s and early 30s somethings moving in. If you have the money and want somewhere to start building a life/ family, you’ll have a lot of company.",t2_12bcvv,bitternmanger,0,1647816044.0,0,t1_i1glkdw,i1glkdw,True,DueMood9,t3_tiwg73,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordNC/comments/tiwg73/got_a_job_offer_in_the_area_have_a_few_questions/,"Got a job offer in the area, have a few questions.",/r/ConcordNC/comments/tiwg73/got_a_job_offer_in_the_area_have_a_few_questions/i1glkdw/,4,r/ConcordNC,0,4

"I was really happy with [1st Priority](https://1stpriorityheatingandair.com).

My AC is old.  A few years back the start capacitor went out.  The company that came out said they would arrive that morning.  They arrived at 5:30 in the afternoon.  They got the AC up and running but kept trying to sell me a new unit.

Fast forward a few years and the AC goes out again.  This time the thermostat wire had shorted out.  I called 1st Priority this time.  I was told they would arrive around 3 PM.  I got a call around 2:30 letting me know they were on their way.  The owner was the tech that showed up.  He located the problem and had the AC up and running quickly.  I asked his opinion of the AC since the previous AC tech had trying to get me to buy a new unit.  His reply was something along the lines of, “if this were my house I wouldn’t replace it.  The unit works.  It’s worked fine all but 2 days and the parts replaced were inexpensive.”  He did ask if the condenser had been cleaned because it was dirty.  I did that extra service and the AC has worked better than ever since then.

In short, 1st Priority showed up when they said they would and didn’t try to upscale me while making my AC run better than it had in years.

"I avoid it mostly because of the traffic situation right now. Once the dedicated entrance ramp is done, that'll help things a bit and then I can get to the Krispy Kreme faster. 

As for the crime, it's been like that for ages. It's one of the ""best"" places for teens to go from some of the more crime riddled areas (read: closest). Northlake is in a similar situation. Most of the violence seems to be related to typical teen drama, but you know, they have access to weapons now instead of fighting with their fists like the good ole days before cctv cameras. I do find that a majority of the violent activity is closer to the theater, so I tend to avoid that part of the mall. I also don't go on weekends if I can help it because the mall is that much more packed. 

I frequent Carolina Mall by the Cabarrus Atrium Hospital more for my every day shopping. It's got the two shops I like (hot topic and books-a-million) and the food court has really nice options and it's generally not busy.

"If you're a freshly graduated grad-student these might be budget tight housing neighborhoods in Concord (at least to buy, maybe renting with roommates, but you know your financial situation), I grew up off Poplar Tent and there are a bunch of nice neighborhoods there. King's Crossing is sorta higher end, Carriage Downs is mid-high end, and Gable Oaks is mid-end. Just around the corner up George Lyles Parkway is Laurel Park which is nice mid-end neighborhood, as well as a bunch of apartments near there (e.g. Laurel View). There's also Afton Village at the corner of Poplar Tent and George Lyles that's a really nice area, lots of little eateries and boutiques as well as homes and apartments across many price ranges.

The area is great. 5 minutes away from the mall by interstate, 10 minutes away from Downtown Concord, and built among a bunch of fresh young businesses and hangouts.",t2_f2jt7,Orisno,0,1615487249.0,0,t1_gqlmgra,gqlmgra,True,[deleted],t3_lwmrkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordNC/comments/lwmrkv/neighborhoods_to_avoid_in_concord/,neighborhoods to avoid in concord?,/r/ConcordNC/comments/lwmrkv/neighborhoods_to_avoid_in_concord/gqlmgra/,1,r/ConcordNC,0,1

"Contrary to what others are saying here, the area directly around downtown Concord has some of the safest neighborhoods I've ever lived in or visited. Tree-lined sidewalks run alongside historic homes and are filled with people walking, running and enjoying the outdoors. The greenway and several parks connect for easy access to tennis courts, basketball, and playgrounds. New breweries have popped up and the revitalization effort has construction underway in many parts of downtown, and the home values are increasing. Being such a close neighbor to Charlotte promises positive growth over the next several decades.

The Concord Mills area does have a lot of new neighborhoods and retail surrounding it and provides easier access to I-85 for a Charlotte commute, however the mall itself and some of the nearby areas (think vast parking lots) have become an focal point for crime and sex trafficking. A Concord police office was recently shot/killed in the area. IMO, the mall area is less safe, lacks character and feels more like a cultural and retail wasteland by the highway. Downtown Concord is essentially the opposite.

Not sure why someone said avoid downtown. I’ve lived in downtown concord since I was 14 (left for college but moved back because it’s much cheaper than CLT) and am now 28 and just moved away (big cross country move).

Second safest part would be any neighborhood off 73 like lantern green etc. Concord isn’t exactly crime ridden anyways so you shouldn’t have a big problem - but don’t move near concord mills,t2_4dgn8uej,sluski,0,1614784762.0,0,t1_gpji0k7,gpji0k7,True,[deleted],t3_lwmrkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordNC/comments/lwmrkv/neighborhoods_to_avoid_in_concord/,neighborhoods to avoid in concord?,/r/ConcordNC/comments/lwmrkv/neighborhoods_to_avoid_in_concord/gpji0k7/,6,r/ConcordNC,0,6

"Concord is a bit like Matthews. The entire city is about 100k residents but 80% of those residents are suburban annexations southward towards Charlotte and Huntersville. Most of the annexation is just to control Charlotte's suburban and exurban development. The most densely populated areas of Concord proper are those around Concord Mills, not downtown. I would estimate the historic city limits is approximately 20k. You can also see this trend in historic Census Data. The city was no more than 20k before the 80s when they began to annex the countryside and the population begins to inflate.

You will get a small town, southern feel living here. The town is historic and walk-able.There are plenty of different neighborhoods. Before COVID-19 downtown was pretty happening. I think the restaurant scene is better in other towns but there's plenty of lunch/dinner spots, bars, arcade, ice cream, etc. There's a lot of work being done over the next year in downtown courthouse renovations, new apartments and sidewalk widening.

My 2c, if you don't live close to downtown it's gonna feel like living in a Charlotte suburb because you're going to be driving on increasingly busy two lane roads as those areas develop. If you can get close to downtown you can get nice, small town living and access big-city, suburban things when you need them.",t2_hvqq0,ThatsLatinForLiar,0,1594741118.0,0,t1_fy1nb4i,fy1nb4i,True,[deleted],t3_hqs1t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordNC/comments/hqs1t7/have_a_question_about_concord_living/,Have a question about Concord living...,/r/ConcordNC/comments/hqs1t7/have_a_question_about_concord_living/fy1nb4i/,6,r/ConcordNC,0,6

"Rare native here so my opinion is probably a bit biased.  30 years ago this area was very different.  The amount of growth the Charlotte area has seen in that timespan is fascinating but like everything else change has its challenges - both positive and negative.  

I believe Concord can still give you that small town feel that you’re looking for with very close proximity to the comforts and amenities of the bigger city nearby. If you wanted to be a little further out I would also suggest checking the next band of towns moving east from Charlotte such as Kannapolis, China Grove, Landis, Midland, Mt Pleasant.   Concord does have access to a lot of schooling choices - everything from standard public to private to Montessori and Charter.  Even if you can’t find what you’re looking for in Concord, Charlotte is a quick drive down the road and not a bad commute - at least not yet.  

As far as school kids go, I have to agree with u/Cabrans it’s still the south and kids are still gonna do what their parents teach them.  I do believe that lack of tolerance for something different increases the further away from “the city” you get, but that’s just been my own personal experiences.  At the end of the day I’ve never had the impression that bullying is a bigger problem here than anywhere else - kids are kids and most are still trying to figure it all out - just like their parents. 

This area is a quick day trip to beach and mountains and plenty of stuff to do around here on the weekends.   With over 70 people a day moving to the CLT metro, this area is rapidly changing and I don’t think that’s a bad thing.  A small town growing up gives newcomers the chance to be the change they want to see in the world.  You’ll meet people from all over in this area.  I often joke that I meet more people from Ohio around here than actual natives.  

So ya’ll come on down, get comfortable and stay a while.

"Hi all, last night our dog, Milo, got out while my boyfriend was visiting a friend in Landis. There were fireworks, he got scared, and broke out of his harness. He got out around 9pm, we spent most of the night looking for him.
He's approx 50 lbs, blonde colored Lab mix, very sweet temperament. I imagine he's likely very scared, but he typically loves people. Food may not be the most enticing thing but he loves fish flavored treats. He doesn't know the area at all so we're not sure he would know how to get back to our friend's.
If you catch sight of him please let me know. He has a microchip, he lost his tags when he got out but should still have a collar. The police have been alerted so we're hoping people would report him, but figured we'd attempt to cover everywhere we can.

They are. You won’t be able to turn. It’s going to be a wide sweep for the transmission to 29.  I have seen some stuff but it wasn’t final. I’m not sure how it is going to affect traffic on the 29 side of it. Another big problem is the turn lane on poplar. It is so short people are always illegally merging into the lanes for the gas station and Kmart to get to it. Which creates a danger for people wanting to turn. If orange pile-on’s we’re put into place people would just run them over. Lol hopefully those turning lanes will be secluded with concrete risers. We won’t need turning lanes for k mart any more.

"This sorta depends on where in Concord you're looking. There's a large section of of developments that sit near I 85, Concorde Mills etc. There's lots of new development happening there but I can't wait to speak to what it's like living there. There's another area near downtown Concord. Lots of historic homes, tree-lined streets, sidewalks and a very accessible, yet small downtown. It's almost picture perfect Americana, however this area has less of the amenities you might be used to. (retail, dining options)
 
Concord seems to be 15/20 years behind a lot of the towns along the I 77 corridor. However I do believe now is a smart time to invest in this area. There is a downtown master plan with some pretty exciting ideas being proposed. And as construction on I 85 wraps up in the next few years this area will be just that much more accessible.
