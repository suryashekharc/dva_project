"Caveat: I'm a local and have not stayed at either.

The Perry is a nice new hotel with a great restaurant, however you will be taking the shuttle EVERYWHERE. It's not technically on Key West but rather Stock Island so it's quite far from everything you sound like you want to do in KW.

That being said Capitana is also quite a ways from beaches and old town, just a bit closer.

As far as bike rental, even if Capitana doesn't offer it there are dozens of places in town that will drop off a bike to your hotel and pick it up from there so don't let that be a deciding factor.

"The beaches are no dogs allowed by county law I believe and it’s for sanitation and health purposes. If you sit under a tree a little off the beach it’s ok.   As for the boats some may allow a service dog but it must be in your possession at all times, so no snorkeling.

"As far as I’m aware none of the big charters allow dogs and it’s a pretty bad idea in general, though occasionally there will be a dog friendly brunch sail or so.  You can’t just leave your dog alone while you snorkel either and those trips can get rough.  You could do a private small boat charter and I doubt they’d care.  Most bars allow dogs but many restaurants do not, and they are not allowed on any beach aside from tiny dog beach.  They are allowed in fort Zach but not on the beach itself.

DJ's Clam Shack is good but nothing special.  A bit touristy and overpriced.   

El Siboney is good.   I'd also recommend First Flight Cafe.   Garbo's Grill is the best food truck there by far.   Firefly is good for Southern cuisine (a couple blocks off the strip).   I also like the steak sandwich at Old Town Tavern.   Breakfast at Two Friends is good.   The pizza is pretty good across the street, too, at Island Dog cafe.

Sunset is who I usually rent from.  So I can't speak for all the rental companies.

They didn't say I couldn't go to the back country.  They discouraged it, but once I showed them that I'd been up there before and that I'm aware of how the tide works, they were completely fine it.  
They said the 10 mile thing was for insurance, but also so they don't have to go 30 miles out on recoveries since people like to get stuck.

"No problem.  Just didn't want you to be disappointed.  Story I got from a local is that the (mayor or governor) has property to the north and absolutely hates jet skis.  I think most of the locals don't care for them either, so they banned them from going up north into the back country.  That means the rental companies have to keep a close eye on them.  Don't know if thats true, I'm sure a local can shed some more info.

They've even imposed a lot more limitations on where you can take rental boats.  5 years ago you could go anywhere you wanted.  Now its like a 10 mile radius of the key west.

The good news is that there are a ton of charters, so you should be able to find something that will work.

Go to the wildlife center on White Street at Indigenous Park - the block before the ocean. They take in all kinds of injured birds and rehabilitates them. There’s a little path to a peaceful pond there full of Ibis amd turtles. One of my zen places. It’s free but give them a donation! 

Afterward, you could go to the Garden at west Martello. It used to be a fort but now it is a beautiful tropical garden overlooking the beach. Also free, accepting donations. 

For something quite different you could visit the animal farm at the sheriffs jail on Stock Island! Open only a couple times a week though

"A couple additional thoughts: watch your dog around the roosters.   They're everywhere and can even get a bit aggressive.  If your dog is under the table at a restaurant, keep an eye on her bc they might get in a little scrape over dropped food.   

Also, as others have said, the sidewalks can get pretty jammed so keep an eye on her so no-one gets a bit too close or steps on her by accident (my dog can really get jumpy if he's surprised by a sudden foot in front of him when he's not expecting it).

But yeah, you should be good.",t2_6g9d1ppm,BillyMac05,0,1647622579.0,0,t1_i16a6b2,i16a6b2,True,harshswamp,t3_tfs03c,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyWest/comments/tfs03c/bringing_a_small_dog_to_key_west_good_idea_or_not/,"Bringing a small dog to Key West, good idea or not?",/r/KeyWest/comments/tfs03c/bringing_a_small_dog_to_key_west_good_idea_or_not/i16a6b2/,1,r/KeyWest,0,1
"Actually, yes, I would recommend.   My wife and I have brought our little puppy there a couple of times and he really had a blast and everyone really got a kick out of him!   One of the great things about Key West is socializing with people and dogs are a great conversation starter.    
 SO many people stopped to pet him and talk to us.   Key West (like most of FL) is very dog friendly.  Nearly all the restaurants have outside seating, put a water bowl out for them, etc.  (In fact, just walking down Duval St many of the restaurants and shops set bowls out for pooches).   Our dog was a big hit in Key West and added to our enjoyment of the weekend, so yes, I would recommend.

A couple fun things you can do with him/her:  (If you're driving, stopping at Robbie's Marina (far south end of Islamorada) to go out on the dock and feed the tarpon).  Our dog gets SO incredibly excited by it.   He yelps and runs around.  It's a real experience for him.   They have a VERY small dog beach on the South End near the Southernmost point.   (By Louie's Backyard).     It's small, seaweedy and definitely not a beach for humans but your dog might like it (ours got pretty freaked by the seawood that got all over him so it's hit or miss depending on your dog's temperament).   

There don't seem to be a ton of dogs in Key West bc there are so many tourists and most ppl don't travel with their dog.   For us it was good bc our dog can be a bit skittish with other dogs but bc there were so few, he felt relaxed and I think the people that missed their dogs back home, found it nice to visit with him.   

A few things you'll need to keep in mind, however if bringing a dog to KW:

* Not all lodgings take dogs.   Verify that a dog is allowed where you're staying.  (There are also often 'pet fees' for them, too and some can be a bit expensive).    
* Key West is a very hot place most of the year, esp now that spring is here.   Make sure he gets hydrated and doesn't do too much walking without a break.   Heat, sun, lots of walking can be a lot for him/her.
* Some attractions won't allow dogs - for example, the Conch train doesn't allow them on, most of the boat tours, some of the museums, etc.   Most shops and restaurants allow dogs, especially on the patio - some even have a small doggie menu or will at least put water out for your dog or give him a treat for free.   

If you work it right, a dog, especially a small one, can be well accommodated in Key West!  Hope you choose to take him and I hope it works out for you!

"I've lived in the Lower Keys and Key West since 1995.  There is absolutely a fine and long-standing community of locals here who support each other with a passion and commitment that I've not seen in other communities. 

It is relatively easy to become part of this wonderful community if you take the time to volunteer. There are so many opportunities if you have time to give to the many cultural and charitable non profits.

Every conceivable event and cultural activity has an opportunity for volunteers to participate. All of the  theaters have ushers or volunteers in the box office, for example.  All the museums have docent positions. There are groups that meet every Friday to pick up litter together. There's an active chapter of the ACLU and the Florida League of Women Voters. The Friends of the Library organize great book sales. The Oldest House has tours of the area's finest homes. The Key West Garden Club in the historic West Martello Tower and the Botanical Garden on Stock Island are maintained by volunteers.   There are mentorship programs in the schools.  Just pick an interest, and there will be a group  where you will fit right in.  There's even a huge volunteer group called the Coconut Castaways. They have regular social events and offer their services to various charities and events around the city, which might give you an opportunity to get to know a wide variety of programs.

This is just a list off the top of my head. It reflects my own personal experiences and interests; there are many, many more.

You can come back to sap, berries, etc. that settle and 'bake into' your car so def. try to get covered parking.

Long shot but you could ask a local Inn like Tropical Inn, Wicker Guesthouse, etc. if they're not at full capacity, if they have guest spots you could pay for at a reduced price (probably no, but worth asking the front desk).    

If you've done your research, perhaps Old Town Parking Garage is the best option.

"You could take a bus but I think it would take much longer.   Remember that much of that road is two lanes.   In a car there are a spots in which you can pass.  A bus really couldn't.   And it would be a long drive to even start with so in a bus, I would think you'd need at least 5 hours from say, the Fort Lauderdale area.  Then, you'd need to get to your hotel from where the bus parks with your luggage so you'd need an Uber on top of it.   I would explore flight options to Key West, Fort Lauderdale and Miami.  Then a rental car.   See which makes the most sense.   The good news is you don't really need a car once there so biting the bullet on a flight, finding the most reasonable lodgings you can and watching the restaurants you go to and you can get by without breaking the bank and still have a great experience.    You can also see if there's anyone heading down there and carpool with them (I assume there's sites  /apps for that - you would just need to be careful and make sure you get a fun couple bc that's a hell of a long drive if the person is boring or annoying).",t2_6g9d1ppm,BillyMac05,0,1647282069.0,0,t1_i0nba5v,i0nba5v,True,Yowza451,t3_sxaxqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyWest/comments/sxaxqy/transportation_fromto_miami_and_key_west/,Transportation from/to Miami and Key West,/r/KeyWest/comments/sxaxqy/transportation_fromto_miami_and_key_west/i0nba5v/,1,r/KeyWest,0,1

"You can try a site like thumbtack or something like that.   Ask around for someone local that does such things.  I would just caution you not to go 'too cheap' with it.  In the end, you need a safe boat, a person you can trust.   If you can drive a boat and have the gear you can just rent a boat.

You can also stop at Robbie's marina on the way down there (if you're not flying).    It's in Islamorada.   There's a dock where you can feed the tarpon and so there's a ton of tarpon in the surrounding waters and it would likely be easier to ask someone at Robbies or in Islamorada to take you out.  You can tack at least a 20% increase for any services in KW.

"Hi.  I live in Fort Lauderdale and go to the keys a lot.   While the drive is nice, you have to understand, it's an extremely far drive to the end of the line (Key West) - about 4 hours from Fort Lauderdale - sometimes longer.  So just doing an overnight might not make sense.   And the rest of the keys, IMO, is pretty - a couple nice little places to stop, but they aren't destinations unless you just want relaxing and mellow.   

Key West is very expensive but does start to get less so around March.  But the $450/night is probably par for the course until April arrives.   

You could look at staying a bit farther out (Big Pine Key or any properties beyond Marathon (which is about an hour outside Key West).   Look at staying on a boat, if you don't mind that.  The hotels are cheaper in 'New Town' (a bit far from the strip but a cheap, easy Uber ride and some hotels have free shuttles).

"I live in Fort Lauderdale and have been to Key West many times.   One thing I will say off the bat.   Key West is not ideal for kids / people under 21.   There's not quite enough for kids to do and the nightlife and such just isn't always family friendly.   That said, if you're going to take the kids, here's a few suggestions.

1. Go in the Spring (March - May) or Fall (Sep - Nov).  Off season.
2. You can eat pretty cheap in Key West.   Just do a little research.  Some of the best places won't break the bank.
3. Go to Mallory Square - There are a few vendors but the entertainers are free (but you should tip them just a bit if you stay to watch or take photos/vids).   The sunset alone is fun.  And free.
4. Get off Duval Street
5. The beaches are free except for parking and it's a nice way to enjoy Key West.   For Zachary State Park / Beach is a good one
6. For lodging, the farther you get from Duval Street (get farther from old town and more toward new town), you should be able to get a reasonably priced hotel that allows kids - Hilton Garden Inn, Courtyard, Fairfield Inn are all in the same basic area allow kids and aren't terribly expensive by Key West standards
7. For an inexpensive activity with kids, there's the Conch Train, The butterfly exhibit / garden, the botanical garden, free public parks and beaches

Have fun!",t2_6g9d1ppm,BillyMac05,0,1646449991.0,0,t1_hzemt2v,hzemt2v,True,tfcheng12,t3_t3iot9,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyWest/comments/t3iot9/how_to_tour_key_west_without_breaking_the_bank/,how to tour key west without breaking the bank?,/r/KeyWest/comments/t3iot9/how_to_tour_key_west_without_breaking_the_bank/hzemt2v/,1,r/KeyWest,0,1

"You didn’t mention when you wished to vacation there or what price range is reasonable for you. 
Season has lots to do with price. 
I just spent a couple days researching accommodations in Key West for a young couple (nephew & girlfriend - age 20) to stay that would permit their ages & not be ultra expensive.
You are correct that many places want guests over 21 & if children are along the property requires they need to be at least age 16.
Consider renting a houseboat or efficiency motel room & no problem with the kiddos at this place. 
Google Harborside Motel & Marina, you will see it’s in a convenient location. It’s not luxurious but looks very clean and comes with excellent reviews & necessary amenities - including wifi, pool, picnic area with BBQ grill, coin laundry too!
I have not stayed here but thought it unique & worthy of passing along to my nephew looking to stay in Key West.  
If you have any military privileges, accommodations at Trumbo Point & The Annex (Southernmost area) are economical & convenient!
Be advised later October is Fantasy Fest, it is very popular but that scene is not for families with young children. Accommodations during that celebration are scarce and much more expensive!

"At the end of the winter season, a lot of rental RVs are left in FL.

The rental places often offer deep discounts to help them reposition their fleet, all across the country. You usually have up to 7-9 days to get to its destination.

Wow, I was not aware of that. I'm also learning that there isn't any tax break for landlords to rent BELOW market, rather, the IRS sees it as their personal dwelling and are no longer taxed the same as if is was rented AT market value?

I understand that a city can't control who buys and sells. Instead, they counteract with a density bonus program aka affordable housing. I could have that wrong, but I've been trying to learn how all of this works.

What I'd like to know is how a density bonus program is audited.

We have regulations in place that attempt to do just that, but people regularly go around them, exacerbating the problem. Yet, when I point out this issue, I'm somehow the jerk?

The pricing doesn't impact me personally - I'm lucky enough to own my home. However, I have seen people who've lived here a long time be forced to leave because their lease ended, the landlord tripled the price, and they couldn't find anything else ""achievable.""

"My husband and I got married at Smathers Beach, by Weddings to Go. Just the two of us, and it was perfect—dare I say “magical”? We go to KW every year in February … but this one. Prices are so outrageous. Our usual haunt is now over $1000/night. I’m so sad about it… 

… as for places to propose, I think it really depends on your  style. Schooner’s Wharf on the top deck overlooking the Marina would be cool. The smaller sunset cruises would be awesome too.

"Danger and Honest Eco try to avoid the Archer mooring balls unless weather makes it the only option. But you're correct. Both rarely go to the reef. (Though the full-day trips will often go to Man Rocks or other patch reefs if sea state/vis allows). Their focus is on the back country sponge gardens. It's not the high drama of the reef. But it offers a super chill and up close look at a lot of cool wildlife. Both companies have guides in the water trained not just to spot wildlife but also to explain the behavior of different critters. Again, it's not as dramatic as the reef.

"When you buy a place the assessment will go up to near market value value regardless of current assessment, as it should.  They vary due to homestead exemptions 


Only an insurance agent can help with the insurance questions for specific units, they vary wildly.  And even if you get a quote it may be wrong, mine was $5k a year too low.  And expect insurance to go up by maybe 50% as new rates for wind and flood are coming and they aren’t good. And the X zone is about to get cut in half so many of those will need it.  And remember, just because you don’t have to have it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.  Sure would suck to pass on flood insurance to only have your house flooded.

Some condos include all insurance some almost none, it varies. You will need to carry some yourself most likely 

Don’t forget all having coconuts removed, or someone putting up your shutters ($1000) if you’re out of town.  You’ll need termite contracts, and you will replace rotten wood.  Everything rusts and breaks faster and needs replacement quicker.  Stainless steel does in fact rust

"I can speak to a few points.  Florida has a homestead exemption that limits annual property tax increases if it is your sole primary residence.  I pay property taxes on around $450k although my house is worth $2mil but I've homesteaded it 20 years.  I pay about $2100 a month in homeowners/wind/flood.

There are major changes in flood insurance ratings happening right now, so I would carefully investigate the impacts and not assume any grandfathering.  Look up ""Risk Rating 2.0"".  One major concern here for home maintenance is termites.  They are here and you will have them.  Drywood ones are a bother but tenting every 5 years or so keeps them in check.
