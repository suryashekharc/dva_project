"Transfer at Secaucus to NY Penn can be tough but it's not as if it's so crowded you'd miss a train, and if you do there's tons of 'em anyway. But yes it'd probably be standing room only into Penn.

Spring Valley is end of the line, if you get on at Pearl River that's 10 mins savings each way. Suffern and Ramsey time tables look to be roughly the same, but those put you farther from Westchester by a decent amount. and further south into Jersey you go, the worse it gets going into Westchester, so it seems anywhere you save time, he would lose and vice versa.

So if you decide that NJ Transit is your best choice to commute, I'd recommend Nanuet first since it's the most even of the options, Spring Valley or Pearl River second. I see other people recommending bus lines, carpooling etc. which I don't know much about. No idea about home values though, of those three Spring Valley is likely the cheapest.",t2_6mjim,seanfidence,0,1647447161.0,0,t1_i0wf2f7,i0wf2f7,False,ninamarie8253,t3_terk7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockland/comments/terk7v/nyc_commute/,NYC Commute?,/r/Rockland/comments/terk7v/nyc_commute/i0wf2f7/,1,r/Rockland,0,1

"If you were working on the west side in the 20-30's you could find parking on the street in the garment district and the surrounding areas.

"NJ Transit (Metro North) trains from Spring Valley, Nanuet or Pearl River will get you to NY Penn in about 60 mins express or 80-90 mins with local stops, via transfer at Secaucus. If you work anywhere between Greenwich Village up through 33rd St you can take train to end of line in Hoboken and catch a PATH train. I would go into 13th St, so from the time I step on the train, a local stop train from Spring Valley to the PATH, take that to 14th St stop and walking a couple blocks into my building was about 1hr45m total. Returning was roughly the same, it's all scheduled trains so no traffic to deal with.

The other train stops on this line are all in Bergen County NJ, if you're priced out of Westchester then you're priced out of Bergen. I never used the Suffern train so can't say.

NJTransit was fine in my experience, delays were not super common and service was fine. Other people have more complaints but I didn't mind. If you're doing this commute, you'll need to occupy the train ride somehow, either work or watching Netflix or read a book or nap or whatever. But if you have to be in the office for a hard 8-9 hrs, and then over 3 hrs commuting, you better have a good way to make use of that time.

"Haven't commuted since the pandemic, but since no one else posted anything yet, I'll give you my two cents since some information is probably better than no information.

>how do people do it?

Train: If you live in or near Nyack, you can drive to Westchester to one of the Metro North stations. Otherwise, you can leave from one of the Rockland stations (Suffern, Spring Valley), and get into the city through Jersey. You can also always drive to an NJ station if you'd rather do that than taking the train. From what I remember, going in through Jersey is not a very good option. The trip was long and the trains didn't run as frequently as would have been ideal.

Bus: You have the Shortilne, which is what Coach USA calls the commuter buses. I used to take the one from Nanuet. It was usually fine commuting in, and absolute hell commuting back. First, it always--and I do mean always--showed up **at least** 20 - 30 minutes late. Another option is to drive to an NJ park and ride and take an NJT bus. I've personally never done this, but from what I've heard, this is a better option if you value reliability and don't mind driving a bit. Keep in mind also that buses have to deal with traffic. For reference, my commute downtown was normally a hair shy of two hours. Coming back was a bit longer because the actual trip would be almost as long, and I had to spend a lot of time waiting for the bus to actually show up. 

Car: The best commuting situation I've ever had was a carpool. Hands down. The public transportation in Rockland is awful. 

>how is the tappanzee bridge traffic in the morning for my husband to drive to work in Westchester?

Again, speaking only pre-pandemic, the bridge itself wasn't bad. The traffic was mostly a problem before and after the bridge.

"Also very early on they had those motion simulators. 1999/2000 on the 4th floor just outside the center stack elevators on the (former) Ferris wheel side. First one was an enclosed pod, seated 4 or 6, that went up down left right and side to side. It was replaced soon after with a newer two seater that also rolled and flipped. 

I remember riding those things so many times growing up. Was like $4 or $6 a ride. 

This is not related to the 4d theater at Dave and busters. It was a stand alone vendor on the floor.

It was one of these things for the two seater version.

"It’s not entirely wrong, Hasidic or Chasidic are both acceptable. There are many different Chasidic sects with different traditions but a lot of similarities.

They tend to be highly insular, and highly mistrusting of outsiders. This gives the religious leaders a large amount of influence over the community. So if the leaders say to vote for a particular candidate a large percentage (almost all) will do just that. That combined with free transportation to polling places in some areas gives them an oversized impact on elections.

In a area with a large population of Chasidic Jews you can end up with a school board that is majority Chasidic, and their priorities are not the well being of public school students, but rather their own children who all go to private religious schools.

Chasidic families routinely have 6-12 children, which means they need a lot of housing. They also seem to have an inside track to housing subsides, possibly through less than legal means.

Jewish developers sometimes skirt density regulations or change the regulations to transform single family communities into multifamily complexes. Case in point is Kaser, a village strictly created to allow high density construction.

It’s sad that it has to be said but you’re welcome - as a Jewish (Reform) member of the county I am disheartened by the anti-Orthodox and anti-Hasidic rhetoric. There is a way to question the actions of a community without attacking them and I think that is often forgotten.

"Lifelong rockland resident with two young kids. We didn’t end up finding a house in VC, but it was one of the places we looked (wide net). I love the area because I thought VC and Congers were a bit less suburban and more country. Super neighborhoody, the kind of place people really stay in. We’re zoned for Clarkstown but I would have gladly sent my kids to Nyack schools. Great sense of community. As you said, so much access. Looking at the political signs around, I’d say it’s a bit on the “red” side (maybe comparable to a place like Eastchester?) but Nyack schools are so awesomely diverse that there’s a good balance, and you’re so close to Nyack. Bottom line: if you were able to find a house, I don’t think anything should stop you from buying there.

">	As for the politics, it sounds like you know a little about what goes on around here. The biggest thing for the Nyack schools community is that there used to be a college called Nyack College but it closed and was sold to the Vizhnitz sect of Hasidic Jews. Thanks to what happened in Ramapo, there is considerable fear that ""Nyack will be the next East Ramapo"" and members of Hasidic sects will move in droves and degrade the schools and property values. I really believe this whole thing is a bit overblown. It's important to keep an eye on what's happening but I don't think it's a reason not to buy here. From what I've seen so far it looks like the Vizhnitz want to use the property as a Yeshiva but that's the general extent of it.

As a member of the Orthodox Jewish (non-Hasidic) community in Rockland I’d like to thank you for refraining from any anti-semtic/Hasidic comments. 

As far as I’ve heard it supposed to be a yeshiva and nothing else, but it’s hardly like I have any inside information. 

While I agree that East Ramapo’s schools have gone downhill in past 20 years (not getting into the why here) I do wonder why you said property values went down. Property values in the Orthodox Jewish sections of town (and surrounding areas where they are going) seem to rise faster than other properties.

Being that I only hear the Orthodox Jewish side to this equation, can you please tell me the other side?

"Hello - I have been living in Valley Cottage for the last five years, and I really like it here! I also grew up in Westchester, but back in 2013 I got a teaching job in Rockland County and in 2015 I crossed the river, first renting in Nyack for a year before buying in VC.

I think Valley Cottage is a really great comprise spot. You've got Nyack schools which although I admit my daughter is not yet old enough to attend (she'll go to VC Elem in 2 years) all of my neighbors are really happy with the school and the district. I have been impressed following what they've been up to and in looking at their facilities. There are some in Rockland who have preconceived notions about Nyack schools. Nyack schools are more diverse than many other districts in the county (but in reality, the entire county is getting more diverse and that is awesome IMO!) and there are definite pockets of poverty which can negatively impact test scores. I say don't go by those school ranking websites, just in talking to people who send their kids to the schools you can get a much better idea.

Despite being in Nyack schools, Valley Cottage is part of the Town of Clarkstown, which is its government. Clarkstown boasts superb parks, many of which are only open to town residents. Congers Lake is right next to Valley Cottage and it is a gem. There are 3 town pools as well. Clarkstown also has really good garbage and recycling pickup.

I also really like where Valley Cottage is located. We are pretty much 15 minutes or less from almost anywhere you'd need to be in the county. My house is 8 minutes from Downtown Nyack, which is the hub of restaurants, nightlife, and the arts for the county. It is an amazing town with great shopping and just a lovely town feel. We wanted to buy in Nyack originally but found VC to be more affordable and you get more space. My house is also 5 minutes from the Palisades Mall and the entrances to the Thruway, 10-15 minutes from shopping in Nanuet, and 15 minutes from the Tarrytown train station when there's no traffic, which we'll use to get to the city sometimes instead of driving or to pick up city friends coming to visit. There is also a TON of outdoor activities here. Rockland Lake State Park is located in Valley Cottage, and there are tons of places to hike around here, my favorites are Hook Mountain, High Tor Mountain, and Buttermilk Falls/Blauvelt State Park.

For amenities directly in Valley Cottage, it's small and there aren't a ton but I feel like it still packs a pretty good punch. The ""old"" downtown VC is on King's Highway and boasts an excellent pizza place, an AMAZING homemade cookie shop, an ice cream store, a barber shop, a Caribbean restaurant, a bodega, and an excellent deli. On Route 303 there are shopping centers, including a Foodtown supermarket, a Rite Aid and a CVS, and several other shops. I find I can get a lot of what I need without leaving VC.

As for the politics, it sounds like you know a little about what goes on around here. The biggest thing for the Nyack schools community is that there used to be a college called Nyack College but it closed and was sold to the Vizhnitz sect of Hasidic Jews. Thanks to what happened in Ramapo, there is considerable fear that ""Nyack will be the next East Ramapo"" and members of Hasidic sects will move in droves and degrade the schools and property values.

1. Take bus from nanuet (shortline). It is non stop (till you reach manhattan) and I think it goes to wall st. This is the cheapest option. I personally didn't like this option as the bus was cramped and my legs got sore sitting in that position.

2. Take train from Suffern to Hoboken and then PATH train. Express trains from Suffern on weekdays every 30 minutes get you to Hoboken in ~50 minutes.

"I literally commuted from Stony Point to the federal building across from the law and order courthouse steps in lower manhattan for a couple years.


The only thing that got me to work in a reasonable amount of time was driving down and leaving my house by 515am. It took me 51-56 min if I did that. It also cost $15 for the GWB and then $46-$64 a day to park. Fucking sucked.

If I left at 545am, it took an hour 20+ and got worse the later I left. The nature of my work made it so being able to change plans and drive elsewhere or drive in at different times an important factor as well.

"Much depends on where in Rockland you live. For Lower Manhattan as others have mentioned easiest bet is probably train from Spring Valley, Nanuet, or Pearl River to Hoboken then the PATH if you're close enough to those stations. There is currently one express train but there used to be two and I hope they bring it back. The express leaves Spring Valley at 6:21, Nanuet at 6:27, and Pearl River at 6:32. You can also get to Hoboken from Suffern and Sloatsburg stations.

If you live in the Nyack or Haverstraw areas it may be easier to get to the other side of the river first. From Nyack take the Hudson Link to Tarrytown. From Haverstraw take the ferry to Ossining.

You’re not IN Nyack, so if you plan on walking into town just do a run through see if it’s doable otherwise go closer to town. Ask about snow removal. Otherwise it’s a great spot, really close to so many restaurants, farmers market, supermarkets, far enough from the mall, easiest commute over the bridge, it’s lively but quaint.",t2_1lv6gmgl,steel510rain,0,1635249175.0,0,t1_hi3qk24,hi3qk24,True,[deleted],t3_qfohp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockland/comments/qfohp9/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Rockland/comments/qfohp9/deleted_by_user/hi3qk24/,1,r/Rockland,0,1

"Nyack College was a Christian college that closed. Its former campus (which is technically in South Nyack) has been purchased by the Vizhnitz sect of Hasidic Jews from the Monsey area. Many people are flipping out, stating this means Nyack is going to become the next Monsey/Spring Valley/East Ramapo. I think it's good to keep a close watch on what's going on but most people are being flippant. In my opinion, the simple answer is we know there is a housing, density, and space issue in Ramapo and the community there would probably benefit from having a large campus on which to study, and then at the end of the day the members of said community will return home to Ramapo to live. I see no indication that the community is trying to ""make Nyack into the new Ramapo"" as some have suggested.",t2_d8rnw,jonross14,0,1635216182.0,0,t1_hi2gqqo,hi2gqqo,False,[deleted],t3_qfohp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockland/comments/qfohp9/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Rockland/comments/qfohp9/deleted_by_user/hi2gqqo/,5,r/Rockland,0,5

"It really sounds to me like Nyack fits your bill. Crossing the TZ is a piece of cake on weekends except going WEST on Friday nights and EAST on Sunday nights during the summer, but you'd be going the opposite directions to see family. Tons of young families, lots to do, tons of nature (lots and lots of hiking and state parks), and yes there's off-leash dog parks. If you end up in Upper Nyack or Valley Cottage (which are both right by Nyack and share a school district) you'll be in Clarkstown township and you can use their dog park. There's also a dog park on Elizabeth Street in South Nyack and one at Kennedy-Dells Park in New City. Don't listen to the haters :)

EDIT: I want to add I think people love to get flippant about the Nyack College sale. It was shady and not great, but there is absolutely no indication that Nyack is going to become the next Monsey. What people forget is that Monsey has had an Orthodox/Haisidic population for a looooong time, and Nyack is and still remains desirable for young families and tourists. It's best to keep an eye on what's going on but I don't think at this point it's a reason to avoid buying here.",t2_d8rnw,jonross14,0,1632965316.0,0,t1_hesq6qj,hesq6qj,True,ImAdamnMermaid,t3_pxuefl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockland/comments/pxuefl/pros_and_cons_of_moving_to_nyack/,Pros and Cons of moving to Nyack?,/r/Rockland/comments/pxuefl/pros_and_cons_of_moving_to_nyack/hesq6qj/,4,r/Rockland,0,4

"Harriman state park has tons of hiking, and some of the smaller parks, Blauvelt and nyack, have enough for daily wandering.  
  
The downtown scene is small with a few bars scattered, but if you want ""nightlife"" you go to the city.  
  
Nyack restaurant scene blends with the surrounding towns (Tarrytown, nanuet, Piermont, pearl River, tappan, etc) so if nyack proper doesn't have the type of food you want, just drive 10 minutes the other direction.  Ive never had a problem finding what I want to eat.  
  
Grocery stores here are ok. I feel like the closer you get to the city the better the become. Closer to jersey and there's tons of Korean markets, there's a few Indian markets in nanuet, and if you want Chinese markets you have to head south.  I still have to find a quality Mexican/Hispanic market and getting those types of ingredients are hit or miss in the groceries. For instance went to 3 grocers yesterday trying to find dried acho and pasilla with no success.
  
The biggest gripe I have is the COL here. Houses are near non existent below 500k, and im sure the rental market is high. Check the tax rates for the local you may want to live bc we have some of the highest in the nation.  Theres also the local religious politics here, which are... unexpected.

"I’ve lived in Nyack for 22 years. Moved here in my early 20s and now have a kid in the middle school. Nyack has served all my needs for the entire time I’ve lived here: great social scene in my 20s-30s and now a great place to raise my kid. And throughout that entire span of time, great places to eat. 

The only thing is that housing can be expensive and the quality of rentals is all over the place. I’ve lived in a lot of places and some of them have been amazing (including where I live now) and some have been older with careless landlords. If you are in fact looking to rent I would strongly recommend using a realtor. The fees suck but you will have access to better quality places. There is also one new apartment development called Pavion which is very close to town. Not sure about pricing but it’s modern and has parking and a pool which  are both huge pluses in Nyack. There are also two other complexes being built in the village but I don’t know what they’re called. 

As for buying a house, don’t know your budget but there is very limited inventory for anything below $500,000. Most listings are $600K and way above. 

As for traveling across the TZ, it takes me less than 20 minutes during off peak hours to go from Nyack to the Tarrytown train station, for example. However, traffic always seems to be backed up in that direction on Sunday afternoons. Maybe it’s people heading back to the city after a weekend upstate.

"Random thoughts:

There's Elizabeth Place Dog Park.  Though it's been vacant nearly every time I've walked my dog by it; as I only got my dog partway into the pandemic, I'm not sure whether or not it's related to that.

As another poster mentioned, the sale of the college and how well the new tenants mesh with the community, and any possible associated political issues, remains a concern for me, personally.  I would argue that's more of a concern for South Nyack that it is Upper Nyack, though.

I'd rather not disclose publicly where I live, but I could easily take my dog hiking every day if I wanted to. Ticks are a real problem here and I see them on my dog frequently when I take her for a long hike during tick season - just an FYI.  That being said, there are definitely lots of trails, views, etc. around Nyack.  The Hudson River trail, Esposito trail and Old Erie Path, Buttermilk Falls Park, Hook Mountain, etc.

Flooding issues are localized.  My house in Nyack is not even in a flood zone as far as FEMA is concerned.  A higher number of houses do tend to have water issues as Nyack is very hilly, resulting in water flow management problems around foundations.  They're generally things you can work around by installing french drains and whatnot, so I wouldn't worry too much about it... just house hunt carefully and don't wave the home inspection.",t2_ct63w,DMRv2,0,1632921355.0,0,t1_hepvzcb,hepvzcb,True,ImAdamnMermaid,t3_pxuefl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockland/comments/pxuefl/pros_and_cons_of_moving_to_nyack/,Pros and Cons of moving to Nyack?,/r/Rockland/comments/pxuefl/pros_and_cons_of_moving_to_nyack/hepvzcb/,7,r/Rockland,0,7

"Poppa, to your points....
1.  Agreed, if you don't like it, run....certainly vote.  Not sure what you mean by let them do their job?   Do you mean, stay quiet, don't complain at a public forum designed for such a reason.  No one is actually stopping them from doing their job, but elected officials still need to need to be held accountable and one of those ways is at these public hearings.  For them, the ultimate accountability, is getting voted out, but hearing dissent is certainly one.

2.  Sucks any child has anxiety, but it's a strong statement about the parents imposing anxiety.  I would say 99% of these kids have anxiety because of covid lock downs, isolation, social distancing, (kids are not meant to social distance, they are meant to interact), not seeing facial expressions, not hearing their teacher clearly, grades suffering, remote classes, fear of covid itself, for some like this kid the actual wearing of the mask.  Now the majority of kids actually adjust very well to the masks, yet suffer the same anxiety....do you attribute their anxiety to their awful parents?   

3.  Nothing to say to this point....we get it.  You like CNN.  But, on a side note, if you are under the age of 65, and don't have a heavy heavy co-morbidity and are relatively healthy, like 99.999999% of kids.  You'll be just fine.

"Yes. Nyack is in for a world of pain. I'd strongly advise against buying land in Nyack. I used to live within the Ramapo school district.

I'm right near the middle of New City now, and there is organized resistance to ""overdevelopment"". But RLUIPA is a big club, and it cannot be parried. Until it is replaced or amended, nothing can stop this tide.

Perhaps this sect (it is only this one group - ""regular"" Orthodox are good neighbors and good people) will burn out after 100 years or so like the Shakers did.

A neutral-language personal summary:

Differing world-views between an ultra-orthodox Jewish sect and other local groups has led to a disagreement in the expectations of how local government serves its constituents and who makes those decisions.

"You messaged me privately, but I'll answer questions to the best of my ability..

The Nick stores were an offshoot of the Viacom Entertainment Store, which was Viacom's attempt to the studio store concept. There was only one in Chicago that was open from summer 1997-winter 1999. There were about 15 Nick stores across the US, mostly on the west coast. The Roosevelt Field mall out on Long Island also had a Nick store, as a friend of mine who lives out on LI confirmed to me about a year ago.

The Viacom store in Chicago didn't meet the company's expectations so it was decided to outright shut that store down. The Nick stores apparently did okay, but Viacom didn't want to commit to the effort of a nationwide chain. Though yeah, had they waited a few months, they probably could have banked on SpongeBob merchandise.

As for the Palisades Nick store, I've got nothing no one else had already said. I have a bunch of plushes from the store, I bought at least Nicktoons CD there once, a couple PVC figurines. No clue where it actually was in the mall..

"I can relate. I started CSA in early 90s when it was new in my region & I had young children. End of first summer they literally pleaded “no more lettuce” & we couldn’t do another leafy thing. It’s a lot at once, even when I tried half shares & quarter shares (over 20 yrs if CSA). Late in the game I bought a high end juicer & still later a Vitamix. I wasted a lotta produce & felt bad about it. I didn’t can back then -I just learned now. But that dirt-yeah. Since we should out produce in fridge w/out washing I dealt with so much dirt & grit in the fridge.   I wished there was an even smaller option but where I lived the local co-op got produce from one or more of those farms in season & Im happier buying small amounts as I please. Never got purslane tho & never grew fond of kale. 😎",t2_95i1x2xn,Hurry_Natural,0,1616520528.0,0,t1_gry9bhq,gry9bhq,False,Galvatron1_nyc,t3_m6wcqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockland/comments/m6wcqi/anyone_have_tips_on_finding_great_quality_organic/,Anyone have tips on finding great quality organic produce in Rockland County?

I was already an avid mallrat around the time palisades opened.  I remember parking in a lot of different areas before I decided on ""my usual spot"", and finding the gravestones just outside the parking garage.  It became something you just had to show your friends who didn't know about it yet.  Just a macabre oddity of the new supermall.  

I never knew the history of it though so I thank you for posting it.  Feels significantly worse knowing it was just a small black cemetery that essentially got engulfed by a huge mall of all things.

"Think about it, if they are being very aggressive, does it seem like a good deal? No.

These solar panel companies are all doing the same thing. They pressure you to install solar panels AT NO CHARGE on your house. Then you sign a contract for like 20 years to buy your ""solar"" energy from them. Then you get a bill every month not much different that you are paying now to your current power company. You say What the hell? And you want to cancel, nope you are stuck. 

Now this company is using your house and they OWN ALL THE POWER being made from those panels. You can't do anything about it.

They basically just use your roof to overcharge you for the power being made on your own roof. They re-sell the energy back to you at a huge markup.

Rule of thumb for anything in life, if you are getting cold calls for a service or product, especially if they are pressuring you, it's a SCAM. No two ways about it. 

If you truly want to get involved in Solar, do your own research and look for your own hardware to do it yourself, or search out a reputable installer, but DO NOT sign 10,20,30 year contracts for power.

"For context my wife did the commute from Valley Cottage for three years and she found the fastest and most cost effective option for her was to drive to the Montvale Park & Ride off the Garden State Parkway and take Rockland Coaches/Coach USA. They aren't the most reliable and she did hate it but without traffic the ride from there is 35-40 min to Port Authority and there's a bus lane in the Lincoln Tunnel. She'd usually hit some traffic on the way home so it'd be about 60 min, but the ride in was pretty close to 40 min. 

Pre-Covid they ran VERY frequently (about every 15 min) and it was nonstop from Montvale to Manhattan, versus NJ Transit which has many stops plus the transfer in Secaucus to contend with. I just looked at their schedules, now they only have 6 buses per day. Here are the weekday departure times at Montvale: 5:00, 5:53, 6:15, 6:45, 7:30, and 8:19. You can buy tickets on the Coach USA app. The stop on the app is called ""Upper Montvale"" and the bus route is 45.

Other options:

* NJ Transit would be the best for avoiding traffic, but it is slow with all the stops & the Secaucus transfer. 
* Metro-North or Hudson Link/Metro-North combo is good but I think coming from Suffern it may not make sense.
* Driving to Weehawken and taking the ferry.",t2_d8rnw,jonross14,0,1610303076.0,0,t1_gis9ilf,gis9ilf,True,[deleted],t3_ku3fgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockland/comments/ku3fgq/anyone_commute_or_used_to_from_suffernhillburn_to/,Anyone commute (or used to) from Suffern/Hillburn to NYC?,/r/Rockland/comments/ku3fgq/anyone_commute_or_used_to_from_suffernhillburn_to/gis9ilf/,2,r/Rockland,0,2

"My God you are either dull or just pretending to be this dumb. Inflated cases? Where is your evidence of that claim? For the love of facts, please cite something. And whom exactly is carrying out this dastardly plot? Some cabal of medical examiners and/or doctors are scheming to inflate the numbers at the behest of lizardmen, democrats, zionists, Dolly Parton? Yes, because fraudulent death certificates are being sent out by the hundreds of thousands to make Donald Trump look bad, a plot so large that it would take the combined efforts of hundreds of thousands of individuals, nationwide, to produce a set of fraudulent certificates to send to the family and then another to be filed with the state to be reported as Covid deaths. A plot that literally would be unraveled by one person requesting a copy of the death certificate on file with city hall and being like, ""I thought Ma died of kidney failure, not Covid"". Oh, and an entire clerking staff to intercept those requests if that's too simple. Oh and you need to pay them a ton of money because they'd literally have the balls of the operation in a vice and could extort millions of dollars from the conspirators involved. Oh you mean one county in Texas back in June or the CDC literally reporting confirmed Covid deaths and Probable Covid deaths since May with deaths still chugging along at about 1000 to 1200 per day on average since?

Now, onwards to debunking your ""1:300,000"" covid death rate. Please link a source. JHU School of Medicine reports the mortality rate of Covid 19 in the US is 2% for Covid and 0.0006% (rounded up) for influenza based on what I'm assuming is the total US deaths per cases. Entertaining your ""inflategate"" theory, 1 death in 300k covid 19 cases would be... carry the 1, 44 deaths. 44 total deaths. 44 fucking deaths. Yes, 265k+ deaths are being fabricated in the US and blamed on covid. The world should only be seeing 200ish deaths at that rate with 62.3 million cases confirmed world wide. But yes, please prattle on about those numbers being opinion and subjective. Or is your rate based on the ""well what if everyone had it but we didn't know and it really wasn't that bad"" theory being investigated by Talking Out Your Ass University School of Medicine?

Ok, mental health time. Your argument is because people are getting the Big Sadz during a shitty time means we need to open everything up again and just let the virus burn through the population some more? Mental health is phenomenally important at all times but you know what really gets people down? Visiting loved ones in the ICU or going to funerals. Yeah, I get people are depressed and anxious because they are thinking ""holy fuck we don't have the savings to be out of work another month"" but that would also be solved by stimulus spending for families and small businesses without risking the lives of Americans. I know, who will pay for it? Idk, military budget seems pretty bloated for not being at war with any actual country, we could cancel a few tank orders for starters, maybe tax wealth like every other western country (because the wealthy will flee to China, Brazil, oh no, they'll store their wealth in Uzbekistan for realsies). Now, domestic violence. Again, a definite problem all year but one exacerbated by anxiety over financial security, or, something that was always present but due to shortened exposure to the abuser wasn't seen as a big issue. And, again, another piss poor reason for reopening the country, ""We need to re-open the country so people stop abusing their partners"" instead of ""hey, abusing your partner isn't cool no matter what the situation is. Job or not. So, get the hell out of that situation, here's some funding a shelter you can go to."" And again, stimulus, for small businesses. We literally fought wars without the means to pay for them but did it anyways so we can provide a family with decent food and mortgage assistance for this.

Ok, now onwards to treating covid with not being obese. Yes, obesity is a major health concern in the US and it definitely has repercussions in your health and your ability to stave off illness. But it is literally every illness, not just covid. And, again, it reduces likelihood which is completely different then prevention. Being able to weather an illness better doesn't make you immune to it. And being healthier doesn't make you less contagious to those around you, which is the point of mask mandates and other things in the interest of public health. 

Now to treatments. The cocktail of drugs being given are to lessen symptoms, sure,  and, if you have the money, antibody plasma, or antibiotics to keep you from developing a secondary infection. But, I'm also talking about ventilators, people being on call or ready 24/7 in case your symptoms worsen or something else emerges, the supportive care available at hospitals that your average person wouldn't have available at home. Those kinds of treatments that responsible public health policies would help to ensure hospitals aren't overburdened so they can keep providing them with that care.

Hospitalizations may be down in your area or just on your specific shift, but they are on the rise everywhere else (NH, CA, AZ, MA, TX, FL to name individual states). New York is seeing a drop in hospitalizations but is prepping for an uptick based on CDC projections. The Atlantic is reporting hospitalizations at all time or new highs in every region but the Northeast but even the Northeast is rising and is inching toward a new high. According to the American Hospital Association, there are 924k staffed beds in US hospitals, about 125ish thousand are intensive care. Currently, over 91k people are hospitalized with covid, almost 10% of our total hospital capacity is taken to treat 1 fucking virus, leaving 90% for literally every other possible cause. According to Statista, hospitals are typically at 65-67% occupancy rates on average in the last decade, or, about 610k people in hospitals at any given moment for all of life's misfortunes. If we reopen, Covid will get worse, full fucking stop. We are probably operating at 75% capacity nationally, but over capacity in some areas and lighter in others. If we reopen, go back to life as normal, we'll overburden hospitals in a month. We were managing through the summer but it is turning around because we are trying to reopen sooner than we should or take ""hybrid"" approaches that literally take everything experts say should be done to maintain low infection levels and then do half of it and then are startled when it doesn't work. 

Please post your articles, I'd love to see what sort of bullshit you are reading. You will be undoubtedly become a doctor, but you're going to get people killed judging by your skim the details grasp of what is going on. My ""bubble"" consists of the CDC, the WHO, Harvard and John Hopkins University Schools of Medicine. Pray tell, where do you get your articles from?

Tyranny, Haha. Today it's wear a mask , tomorrow it's soylent green! You know the same bullshit, slippery slope, rhetoric was used at some point to try and ban relationships between races and same sex couples right? Look at history, all tyrannical governments have been based in progressive agendas, I say sarcastically. Tyrannical governments never use nationalist traditionalism, or religious zeal to rule, I also say sarcastically! It's always homosexuality, loosening of cultural norms, acceptance, and science based policies that leads to government overreach and gay frogs, I say with such gusto and earnestness. God, you keep beating this bullshit drum of tyranny but can't grasp the concept that refusing to wear masks and taking extra sanitization efforts in the name of freedom and trying to save small businesses is what is perpetuating the shutdown. 

And you do realize lions are the epitome of welfare state abuse right? The male does jack shit while the females do everything from child care to most of the hunting. Social darwinism is pseudoscience and zoological quackery at its finest. 

Socialism like The Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, Germany, France? Not like the Netherlands literally founded capitalism 400 years ago or anything. Or how Norway encourages entrepreneurship with socialist access to capital. Ooo what about Germany's communist industrial output beating the US per capita. Or the UK's super stalinist healthcare system literally operating on the principles of capitalism where you get better quality care by paying more with supplemental insurance but still managing to cover everyone without burying individuals in debt.

You are seriously just brimming with anecdotes and half-baked assumptions. ""Educate people and print pamphlets"" is your plan? Are you that laughably naive to think the health of the country should be in the hands of fucking plumbers and the average person rather than at the direction of actual virologists and epidemiologists? Hey, let's let farmers build bridges and mail everyone a pamphlet to educate them to only use bridges they think are safe rather than just enforcing building codes because we wouldn't want to infringe the bridge building rights of the average citizen! Oh, and we can't let silly boards exams or the BAR stop people from treating severe illnesses or offering legal advice , due process and the right to legal representation be damned!

"Amazing, almost everything you said is wrong. 

The flu is far less deadly and this is an anecdotal myth. There are currently 1.4+ million deaths from covid worldwide. The flu kills 250k-650k a year on average world wide (source: John Hopkins). Even on its worst year, the flu is half as deadly. And that's not factoring in the likelihood of nations falsely reporting lower numbers (China, Russia, NK to name the Holy Trinity). So take that bullshit and promptly shove it up your ignorant ass because all you need to do is google your anecdotal assumptions and get presented with actual data from medical schools and researchers. 

Also, Covid, if not properly treated, is leaving people with long term health conditions, which the flu doesn't do unless you get a secondary lung infection like pneumonia, with heart and organ conditions being extremely, extremely rare if they happen. If hospitals are flooded and we run out of bed and overwork healthcare workers, what the hell do you think will happen? We'll be out of beds, staff hours, hell some hospitals may even run out of supplies. 

So yeah, shut down the businesses that won't enforce mask policies because there is literally no actual risk to people wearing them. This isn't kneeling at a fucking football game or wearing some bullshit bracelet freedom of speech cultural issue, it is a medical-fucking-necessity. This is akin to driving drunk; going into the public arena as a potential hazard to those around you. It is negligent at best and fucking deadly in the worse case. 

Herd immunity is not happening. We get herd immunity from immunizations, not by letting 1.4mil people die. Every person is a petri dish for this virus to change and evolve. Every case is a chance for genetic drift, transcription mistakes, or good old fashioned environmental conditions, to swap up the genetics of this thing to re-infect a whole new group of hosts. You achieve herd immunity by starving the virus of potential hosts through large scale vaccination efforts, not by walking about asymptomatically sending viral particulates into the air and just hoping you don't come into contact with someone else who may not have the right antibodies to keep the virus in check. 

The shutdowns are working, it is morons breaking rules because of FREEDUMBS and people getting too lax too soon that is causing this thing to resurge.

What scares me the most, as someone else pointed out, is that you are posting on MCAT forums. I shudder to think of the people you could kill with your half-assed understanding of science while you partially remember some research article you read written by people with actual, in-depth understandings of the human body. You are a fucking used Ford mechanic thinking they know more than aerospace engineers building rockets. 

My wife worked tirelessly to get a vaccine ready to put an end to this virus and you, and the ignorant ilk like you, are jeopardizing her work and the rest of us. She comes home with her feet swollen, exhausted, stressed, every part of her body screaming and in pain. You think she's making a million dollars? No. 

You want to talk about fear? No, fear is what causes people to pray to some feckless, impotent God for deliverance.  This is anger. Pure, unfiltered, raw rage at morons like you. Why? Because, while brimming with the confidence of a five year old, you boldly claim you can fly before hurling yourself off a roof top. The problem is, you and your compadres of idiocracy, are tethered to the rest of us and your mistakes pull the rest of us with you so we have to work 2x as hard to overcome the problems you cause.

"First of all, there is science behind a bandana's effectiveness in preventing the virus. They are not as effective as regular masks, but they still reduce the infection rates by 40-60% depending on your source. All masks prevent respiratory droplets from going outside your immediate range, but they vary in effectiveness in doing so. That's why the CDC says that masks are not a substitute for social distancing. Keep in mind that someone sneezing could send droplets up to 15ft away but with a mask, it's significantly reduced to under 6ft. As for the issue of freedom, I'm just going to say that if you cant suck it up and do a small, insignificant, basic kindness to another human to prevent the spread of a deadly disease, then you clearly don't have a single ounce of empathy for the 220k people that died in this country.
