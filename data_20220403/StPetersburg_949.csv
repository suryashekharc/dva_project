"I can! It’s nothing revolutionary if you’ve lived here a while. My wife and I are creatures of habit.

-	Mercado next to Green Bench
-	Bodega
-	Cappy’s
-	Paisano’s
-	Engine No. 9 (has changed a little but still pretty good IMO)
-	El Cap (always cheap and simple)
-	Red Mesa (the OG on 4th)
-	Fabrica (when we want some unique pizza)
-	Grand Hacienda (not super old but I’ve enjoyed a lot of their stuff)

We’ve tried a couple of the new places popping up on Central but they were just not up to par. The one thing they all had in common is that they’re expensive. It feels like a cash grab with no soul and I don’t like it. 

Some recent new ones we love:

-	Jay Luigi (on 4th. Their food is unbelievable and the format is perfect. Highly recommend their lunch)
-	V9 Eats (we discovered this place yesterday on 9th and loved it. Kind of a BBQ picnic type place but their menu is more diverse)

Places that have gone down hill:

-	Three Birds Tavern (not sure what happened but something changed and they disappointed us the last couple times we went)
-	Casita Taqueria on Central (they might have come back to their former state, but I have avoided this place for a while.

"This always gets my blood boiling. I'm not fully against off leash dogs in certain situations like the park or in an open field, but in the city the two uses I've seen for this are laziness and showing off. 90% of off leash dogs are not as trained as their owners think. There will be something in this world more interesting than you. And even if it's for a moment that dog will bolt. So next time you let your dog go ask yourself why truly is your dog off leash. Is the extra bit of running or showing off his great training more important than:

1. Respecting any human around you who may be scared of dogs

2. Respecting those who may be allergic and not want to be sniffed on the street

3. Respecting those with reactive/in training dogs who are just exercising
3a. The knowledge that if your dog didn't listen and approaches that dog you are probably setting back this person's training by months
3b. The knowledge that your dog may be bit/killed by that dog, not only causing harm to both creatures but causing undue stress to the owner. Also knowing it would legally be (to an extent) your fault

4. Disrupting the work of any service dogs who may be in the area. Remember, southeastern guide dogs sometimes trains in St. Pete. 

5. Potential harm to bikers/skateboards who have a harder time avoiding obstacles and don't want to be chased.

 If your answer is yes, I guess do your thing. I just hope to not meet you. Because as the owner of the other dog in number 3 I really don't look forward to restarting my training because your golden ""isn't usually like this"".

Clearly this is coming from someone who has only owned easy dogs his whole life. Dogs are like people. Sometimes you get some who have special needs. Maybe your pup was attacked one day and has a fear of other dogs. Maybe he's a frustrated greeter who comes off as mean. Maybe he's just straight up anxious. Most owners are trying their damndest to keep their dogs happy and safe. To come off this critical with no background knowledge seems a lot like me going up to parents of a kid in a chukeecheese and criticizing their parenting,t2_10jvz48b,detectivecads,0,1648980897.0,0,t1_i37hrrj,i37hrrj,False,sayaxat,t3_trt9vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/trt9vi/my_first_encounter_of_dog_off_leash_in_stpete/,My first encounter of dog off leash in St.Pete.

Are you talking about the yacht club, or the community sailing center? They are two separate organizations, with different pricing and benefits, etc. 

&nbsp;

Please feel free to ask me anything about if you want! 

&nbsp;

Idk where if the location is feasible for you but the Clearwater Sailing Center is also really cool, although I haven't been there in many years. The Boca Ciega Yacht Club also seems to be pretty affordable.",t2_ijmyx,Sorestless,0,1648928193.0,0,t1_i35503e,i35503e,False,butthattoots,t3_tujcoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tujcoh/experienced_sailors_looking_for_a_crew/,Experienced sailors looking for a crew,/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tujcoh/experienced_sailors_looking_for_a_crew/i35503e/,1,r/StPetersburgFL,0,1

"The $15 discussion is pretty much dead now. All of these entities waited until $15 was basically a poverty wage before actually offering it. Now they can make themselves look like the heroes, despite this still not being even remotely a living wage—especially in St. Pete where rent is stupid expensive. 

My wife and I bought a house just in time and are grateful to have a comfortable 6-figure household income. But the rent prices here are insane. Before we bought a house, we were paying $1,250/m for a small bungalow apartment near DTSP. Now I hear starting rent is like $1,300+. When I first moved to St. Pete in 2015, my rent was $750/m for a 620sf apartment. It was amazing.

"Throwing modern gender theory that's so rough around the edges at a 5 year old makes no sense. That's the hand at play here. Dems branded this bill as ""Don't say Gay"", but it's not called that. Look at the outrage and misinformation surrounding the bill, and here we have another little mini-movement from the all so righteous left. The dems literally don't want you to look in the bill, so they start calling it ""Don't say gay"" and build this extremely partisan argument focusing on meta things. The school only bans up to 3rd grade...and they're still aloud to learn history and origin. High schoolers think they're doomed because of what publications are saying about this bill. News flash...people don't want their 3rd graders being told they can identify as whatever the fuck they want. Why? Cause you don't even know what identifying is cause your in 3rd grade lmao. Why does a 3rd grader need to know that under modern gender theory, they can identify as unicornself? It's fucking confusing. I'll let my child identify as whatever they want, but I send them to ELEMENTARY school to learn math, science, etc. They're learning the basics. I don't send them to school to talk about gender orientation and theory where half of it is controlled by a mob on twitter. If in 3rd grade, your teacher said ""Jane likes John"", would the class not laugh, or say ""ewww!"", or something similiar? At that age, learning what a crush is happens to be hard enough. Kids aren't gonna understand this stuff dude, they're kids. They don't need to know that xyr/xem exists, let alone the notation of straight exists. Just keep it fucking simple and let kids be kids. Some will like boys, some will like girls, it's literally that simple. There's no place in the education system for that. I mean fuck most of us explore in middle and high school :P.

Because your question shows you lack the knowledge and understanding of why dogs should be leashed. 

It is not only because of people are afraid of dogs.  If you show up at a party, and a few people are brandishing guns.  You started to tell people to put them away, and someone asked you, ""are you afraid of guns?""  The answer is obvious but it's not just yes or no.  

People aren't afraid of guns IF there was never a case of people accidentally, or intentionally, shoot others.  You might not be afraid for yourself because you can handle the shot, or you can run away when bullets start to fly, BUT what about others at the party, and what about the party.  Everyone went there to have a fun time, brandishing guns mean risking the loss of a number of things.

"> It doesn’t affect me or my life

And that's the difference between you and MANY of those who believe there should be leash law. 

Even if it doesn't affect you, you still should advocate for dogs to be leashed when out in public even when there's no leash law.  Simply because you care for others, not just yourself.  

Even if I don't own dogs, even if I'm fine with some well trained and well behaved dogs, I don't want others to feel anxious when they and/or their dog comes across an unleashed dog.",t2_9gajflvy,sayaxat,0,1648827726.0,0,t1_i2zup52,i2zup52,False,sayaxat,t3_trt9vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/trt9vi/my_first_encounter_of_dog_off_leash_in_stpete/,My first encounter of dog off leash in St.Pete.

"Realtor here.  You will know me on the course by my hat that says ""Bad at golf, great at real estate.""  Seriously!

Pinellas county.... struggles for good golf courses.  And what is public is usually overwhelmed with people especially on the weekends.

So far as quality of course, Innisbrook is going to be the absolute best in the area that you will be able to get on, plus Copperhead is also the most interesting from a layout and unique features (hills, water).  You usually need to stay at the resort but you never know.

Most courses in the area are straight out and straight backs with not a lot of space.  This is due to the cost of land here being at extremely high premium.  Bardmoor is the best of the under $100 and has the benefit of hosting the PGA JCPENNY Classic back nin the 70s and 80s.

Seminole Lake is way overpriced for what it is.  At 40ish bucks it's a decent alternative to Bardmoor, though there are not a lot of trees there.  At $80-$90 it's robbery.

Mangrove Bay is one of the busiest golf courses in the entire country.  It's amazing the city can keep it maintained as well as they do.  Basically plan on 4somes and being paired with someone no matter what time of day or week, and the driving range will also be absolutely packed.

Bayou Club is ok course wise but is private.  Personally I prefer Bardmoor.  Vinoy, Pelican and Bellair are also private and you'd have to know someone or stay at the Vinoy.  Honestly most of the ones you listed are Private.

Quite a few Par 3's and executives.  Largo, Cypress Links.

My personal hidey hole is Cove Cay.  Not as many people as the rest, slightly shorter than a regular course, and the greens are mid - small sized.  But there are a few holes that follow Tampa Bay which is rare for golf courses here, plus the holes force you into interesting decisions instead of just ""drive up the middle"".

World Woods as someone else mentioned is or was a Top100 course  (Pine Barrens) but may be under renovations currently as it was bought recently.  Downside is it's about 1-1.5 hours from Clearwater.  It's a hell of a course though.  But if you were going to do that you may as well get on Stream Song which is World Woods x5.

Another interesting standout is Clearwater CC and Dunedin CC.  Clearwater has an active rail line splitting the course, and yes trains do run there!  Dunedin is where the Senior / Champions Tour got its start and many of the old greats played there.  Of these, Dunedin is the more interesting course though they are both very old school since they were built in the early 1900s.  No island greens here.

"Innisbrook as a whole is overrated. The better course for less than half the price is World Woods up in Brooksville. More than worth the drive. 

Bardmoor is always in rough shape. They never put the money back into their course.

If you’re really not up for driving much, Dunedin golf club and Seminole Lake golf club are awesome. Dunedin is actually a Donald Ross design, so it’s cool to play an old school track.

Also, Southern Hills is prob 35-40 mins away from you. That place is top notch. Doesn’t hurt to call and see if they have any public times.

"St Pete resident here. You are coming down at the kick off weekend for Summer travel. There will be tons of people and a lot of traffic so I would be making reservations early. Some restaurants and venues are even now totally booked for that weekend. You will need a rental car which I am assuming you are doing. For your golfing, I would go ahead and see if you can schedule t times as they fill quickly. Innisbrook and Bardmoor are probably your best bet. Most of the other clubs you have listed are private. Some used to offer public play according to t time availability but since the pandemic they are waitlisted for memberships of all types so unless you know a member you won't get on. You could still try calling. Not so sure you want to make that drive from the Clearwater area into Tampa during a busy holiday weekend since traffic sucks. Downtown St Pete is a really fun time. We have the new Pier and a lot of restaurants up and down Beach Dr. Central Ave has a lot of bars and restaurants and the whole area is very walkable. I would go early so you can find parking not too far from Downtown or just take Uber.

"Innisbrook opens tee times every now and then.  I have played there many times.  IMO the Island Course is the toughest of any golf course at the facility.

Bardmoor is not that difficult.   They have deals on Golf Now.

Many of the other courses you have listed are private.  A few are par 3's and one is a putt putt.

Mangrove Bay is a nice municipal course.  They only take tee times 7 days in advance.  If you choose to play there the tee times open at 6 AM for any tee time 7 days in advance. 

I know you mentioned no more than an hour but I would look into playing World Woods.  One of the nicest public courses in our area.

"I worked as a pro in the area for a long time. The problem with Pinellas is the nicer courses are very private, many local private courses will offer reciprocals if you're a member at a private course in your area. Bardmoor is fun, and if the course is in good shape it can be a lot of fun. Copperhead is a beast! And the tour was just here so should be in absolute tip top shape. IMO The Island Course at Innisbrook is without a doubt a better course then Copperhead, it's tighter and doesn't have room for spectators. TPC is a very nice course but it is so over priced it's ridiculous and totally not worth it. World Woods is like 30 min north of TPC and both courses are better for half the price. If you're able to get onto Southern Hills it's one of the best courses I've ever been on, and the quarry course at Black Diamond Ranch is one of the most beautiful golf courses in the State.",t2_5kmpsxc0,IntrepidAvocado1302,0,1648748706.0,0,t1_i2viaaf,i2viaaf,True,SpicyChedda45,t3_tt1wqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tt1wqi/nebraskans_coming_for_our_honeymoon_vacationgolf/,Nebraskans coming for our Honeymoon !

"From NKY/Cincy, so let me first say that it’s not for everyone. It’s a sweeter Greek chili, not at all like a hearty Texas chili. 

Order a cheese coney or 3-way (spaghetti with chili and cheese) those are the staples. Their hot sauce is fantastic if you like hot sauce. 

A chilito is a fun thing to try as well, back in HS we ordered it all the time because it wasn’t on the menu and they made it for super cheap like $1.50. Chilito consists of a chili & cheese in a tortilla but you can ask them to also put spaghetti (a 3 way) inside and it’s fantastic.

"My wife and I are coming to St. Petersburg for our honeymoon over Memorial Day weekend!! We are very excited to visit. Our hotel is close to Clearwater Beach. We would really appreciate some assistance in planning our trip!  
  
My primary question is about golf courses. We are both avid golfers and would like to get in a round while we are there. We aren't willing to drive more than an hour from the hotel for golf (so no Streamsong). After doing some research on Reddit/Google Maps, here's the list of possible course:  
  
\- Innisbrook (Obviously would love to play Copperhead. I've sent an email to inquire about making tee times. Is there any way to play Copperhead if you aren't staying at the resort? If we aren't able to get onto Copperhead, which of the other 3 courses (North, South, Island) are the best to play? Would you recommend the other course vs. any of the others listed below?  
  
\- Bardmoor - Saw lots of recommendations on previous post for Bardmoor. Previous PGA/LPGA stop. Difficult course  
  
Other Courses : Bayou Club, Mangrove Bay & Cypress, Twin Brooks, Isla Del Sol, Pasadena Golf and Yacht Club, Seminole Lake CC, Feather Sound, Vinoy Golf Club, West Chase, TPC Tampa, Clearwater, Belleair CC, Pelican Golf Club, The Landings, Congo River Golf, East Bay Golf Club, Largo, Palm Hill  
  
Any recommendations/insight would be great! Top 2 are currently Innisbrook and Bardmoor, but I'd be happy to change my mind.  
  
  
  
BONUS: We would LOVE some recommendations on beaches/food (seafood)/nightlife/local favorites/tourist attractions close to Clearwater Beach.  
  
  
  
Thank you in advance for your help!

"I frequently take my dogs to the sandbar at Weedon Island, as do many others. It is a tidal sandbar, so check the tides before you go. At the highest tide, my golden retriever can stand in about chest deep water and at the lowest tide there is open sand for maybe 3-4 acres.

For those commenting about environmental concerns - I've never considered that a dog on wet sand and swimming in the bay can cause issues to the local marine environment. Am I missing something? (I ask that genuinely!)

I literally never said any of this. Good try though. I simply said a well trained dog doesn’t need to be on a leash because they are that well behaved. I think you are reading way too much into this. I’m not disagreeing with leash laws but in my personal opinion and nobody else’s I could care less if I see a dog on a leash or not. It doesn’t affect me or my life so it’s not a concern to me. I also do have a dog and I keep it on a leash. To be honest there are a lot of people on this thread who are very sensitive and some of the comments directed at me for an opinion leads me to believe there are some people who need to be on a leash.

Also just because your dog is good doesn't mean that someone who who doesn't know your dog knows that. Some people have been attacked and find off leash dogs to be scary.

Also... Dogs know if another dog is on on or off leash and if a dog is scared or other dogs the fact that they are leashed and the other dogs isn't makes it worse.

"The second your dog is not following commands the owner is in violation of leash laws and the dog is a danger to itself and humans. All it takes is for the dog to feel threatened or scared for someone or something to get hurt or die. Even the best trained dog will slip up with commands eventually. As a responsible dog owner whose wife was bit by a ""well-trained"" dog off leash, I hate seeing this entitled opinion. A loose dog is like a gun: always assume it's loaded and dangerous.

Yes interest rates are going to be a huge player but another aspect that could do some damage to the real estate market as a whole which I dont hear many people consider is commercial real estate.   I believe in our area part of the influx is work from home people are likely to come to areas as ours but those same wfh people no longer need a seat in a commercial building and the numbers will lag because a lot of big companies have 5-10 year leases on office space and as the need for office spaces dry up  over the next few years we may see a lot of empty buildings around which will hurt the land/building owners possibly even converting some commercial real estate to residential opening up a whole new side to things.

"True but on the other hand rising interest rates tend to cool off the housing market and the Federal Reserve is already committed to 7 rate increases. Now they are saying the Fed might even raise rates more than that because of run away inflation. Also, a lot of the accelerated house prices over the last couple of years was because the Fed was printing money in order to help the Covid weakened economy. Millions had been laid off. Finally, regarding last time, what I meant was just like last time, a lot of people are expecting double digit home prices each year going forward when the historic norm in the USA is only 4%. So in that sense, it is just like last time, 2008. Most likely, home price percentage gains will revert to the mean. And last time they were saying the same thing that people from wealthier areas like NYC would keep moving here at a fast rate and we would keep seeing these huge percentage gains. It really isn’t likely.",t2_c5tvgsrd,FloridaPices,0,1648577088.0,0,t1_i2le70u,i2le70u,False,nautitrader,t3_tqaoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tqaoly/when_is_the_real_estate_market_going_to_crash_so/,When is the real estate market going to crash so I pick up a deal??,/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tqaoly/when_is_the_real_estate_market_going_to_crash_so/i2le70u/,1,r/StPetersburgFL,0,1
"Last time as in 2008? That was a whole different animal induced by people getting shitty loans causing banks to fail. That is not the same situation banks do not give out those kind of sub prime loans, it has actually perpetuated this current situation I believe because new home starts slowed after 2008 causing the supply of houses to not keep growing because people just bought up the foreclosures cheap from people who couldnt pay their mortgage because they got into a loan they shouldnt have. Now we have a short supply of houses and new home starts have been stunted because of costs of building materials as well as driving up those prices and it has not made up for the inventory of housing. Iin regions as ours people will probably keep chasing it for a few years. The thing personally I would look for like any ""bubble"" is when the short term investors out weigh the long term investors, ppl looking to make a quick buck. When you start seeing the majority of houses being owned for only a few months and then re sold  then we are at risk of seeing a bubble but the current situation it looks like long term investors are happy buying it up and renting them out at a high rental rate controlling the rent prices. 

TLDR: 

2008 = Shit loans for people buying houses so prices go up because anyone can buy but in the end ppl cant pay which in turn causes banks to fail.                                 

2022 = Low inventory and fear of inflation causing people to buy up inventory including smart money which in turn sets rental prices keeping housing costs high.",t2_7kepje,mo_chaos,0,1648576745.0,0,t1_i2ldaoe,i2ldaoe,False,nautitrader,t3_tqaoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tqaoly/when_is_the_real_estate_market_going_to_crash_so/,When is the real estate market going to crash so I pick up a deal??,/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tqaoly/when_is_the_real_estate_market_going_to_crash_so/i2ldaoe/,1,r/StPetersburgFL,0,1

"I could see that happening too, just leveling off. No way can they keep going up double digits like this.

"lol fair enough — I worded this in a really dumb way.   


What I’m getting at is that interstate remote work at this scale is a new phenomenon with a lot of complex, long-term implications. A lot of which we don’t yet fully understand, and some of which hinge on temporary measures put in place in the height of COVID.  
This “new normal” opens employers up to a lot of legal and tax risks that are undesirable and potentially expensive.I didn’t necessarily mean that Florida would discourage this, because you’re right that it’s advantageous to the state.  
I mean the states and businesses outside of Florida where these employees are coming from might start to push back on these arrangements as COVID dies down.  
Whether it’s handled at a legislative level (re-working current state tax laws) or broadly at a business administration level, I don’t think this is specific version of “new normal” is going to last forever. And I think a lot of people have built a new life around a possibly fleeting arrangement.

I was being a smartass saying I can’t wait til these out-of-staters cards are pulled. Tongue-in-cheek schadenfreude.   
But this broader sentiment is already popping up in politics: Biden’s pushing these talking points with his whole “It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.”  
Eric Adams has also spoken out against indefinite remote work and pointed out the impact its had on downtown businesses lacking normal foot traffic.  


A few examples of some of the risks / disadvantages of out-of-state remote work distilled from these articles, which are more articulate than I am:

\- Companies’ eligibility for state tax credits and incentives for creating jobs often require a certain percentage of employees to be local. It’s in their interest to not lose their credits and incentives to out-of-state remote work.  
\- At the height of the pandemic, several states provided various forms of nexus relief for employees that were encouraged to work from home. However, many of these filing protections have now expired. This could impact their state tax footprint, not only regarding state income tax but also things like payroll and withholding taxes.  
\- Also, income tax withholding and unemployment obligations stemming from locations of remote workers may require new state payroll registrations for companies and could significantly change an organization’s administrative costs.  
\- Also, the convenience of the employer doctrine that results in double taxation in some instances remains unresolved and may create an imbalance in state revenues  
\- Other measures in place that prevent employees from being double taxed could be reconsidered if the arrangement isn’t beneficial to one of the states or employers in those states.  
\- Employees are increasingly mixing business and leisure travel. Employers need to know not only where employees are located but why they are there, because withholding rules and tax reimbursement policies may hinge on the purpose of travel. Employees have begun to embrace working remotely; however, with many states requiring day 1 reporting and withholding, remote employees may inadvertently create a compliance burden for their employers and themselves alike — a burden that may last for years to come if an employee receives long-term compensation",t2_365gh2xj,Substantial_Ask_9992,0,1648566578.0,0,t1_i2kmpld,i2kmpld,False,Justanotherbull420,t3_tqo3vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tqo3vi/so_do_all_the_young_people_downtown_have_their/,So do all the young people downtown have their parents / sugar daddies paying their rent now or did I just mess up in life,/r/StPetersburgFL/comments/tqo3vi/so_do_all_the_young_people_downtown_have_their/i2kmpld/,1,r/StPetersburgFL,0,1

If you look at new homes starts they are just starting to pick up and we have a shortage of houses too, especially in our market, personally I feel its never going to crash people are starting to understand we are in a high inflation period and not sure much will change unless we experience a Black swan event possibly induced by a natural disaster.

If anyone knew the actual answer to that question they would quite likely be the richest person in history.

The market will keep doing what it's doing now until market forces changes.  Everyone thinks the next step is a downturn, which sure, it could be, but it could also just accellerate harder before then, following San Franciso, New York on up the price charts.  

You have no control over it, and quite honestly anything that would crash the real estate market would be huge enough that a bunch of people would likely be out of jobs and banks hesitant to lend money due to risk.  One of the reasons prices drop is because the economy turns to garbage and money is much more difficult to come by.
