Even though it was technically church run, it rarely felt like it, the two guys that ran it were really chill. It didn’t matter if you were an atheist, gay, Catholic, whatever, as long as you weren’t drunk, you were welcome as you were. I met a lot of interesting people there.

The Cherry festival crowd at the open space is like a family friendly amusement park during the day, with some weirdos thrown in. Kind of a WalMart crowd? In the evening, it’s like a spring break beer and party crowd, but more middle aged.

At the open space, there’s a big square with tables that’s like a food court. Two sides have food stalls and the other two sides are stalls with souvenirs/fancy souvenir food. Customers look like a typical Michigan mall. That area is close to the concert stage, so tends to be more rowdy and active late into the evening.

"Yeah door dash and stuff is totally fine in the area. Although certainly a pricier option. There's some good food pretty close to campus though. TC thrives off of tourists so don't worry about not looking like one. Honestly as long as you're not rude and don't drive 25 below the speed limit you're set. 

Not sure what you do for hobbies, but the outdoor scene here is amazing. We have some great disc golf courses and a great new climbing gym too. I'd also recommend looking into some sort of winter outdoor hobby as that's the toughest part of living here. if you find one you like it can make you actually enjoy winter rather than endure it. 

Hope you like the area and welcome!

"Fellow Chicagoan here, haven't made the move permanently but I've spent a lot of time up there in the last year. 

The public transport is doable but it's not comparable to a city like Chicago. As others have said, biking is your friend. If you live right downtown though, it's certainly walkable. Perhaps a folding electric scooter could be a stand-in for longer treks. All that said, the public transit is surprisingly good relative to other smaller towns though, especially some of the options to and from the outlying areas. I'm normally staying in the sticks, one county out and I can literally call and get a bus to downtown TC for $4. That's a separate county system but in TC you have a bigger system called BATA, which seems even better.

Anyways I don't have much to offer but I wanted to respond because I believe if you want to be carless, it is possible. The winter months will be tough but I'd say give it a shot.

"Welcome to TC.

Best bread, bagels and Croissants are from 9 Bean Rows.  They are in suttons bay / lake leelanau but they are at the farmers market every Saturday and Wednesday.

In the summer NMC runs a Cafe at Lobdell's.  It is the BEST view of the bay and quite affordable.  It's one of TC's ""secrets"" that most tourists don't know about. 

Avoid the big Chain places.   There is no reason to go to Starbucks, panera, etc.  Instead, support local like Cuppa Joe, Toms, etc. 

Public transport is just ok.  BATA will get you most places but you need to plan because the schedules are not like Chicago.

There is not a decent Italian beef to be found anywhere and portillos hasn't made its way here yet so the hotdog scene is weak too.

Aldi is a good place other than meijers. They dont have a large  selection as the chicago-land ones do but they are similar.

For fresh produce hit Oryana.  It's expensive but good quality. 

For seafood,  Oryana west has a good selection. Very similar to Burritts but notably less expensive. 

We have a nice Asian market on 14th street and a good Latino market on South Airport. 

Frenchies for a good pastrami.  U&I lounge for an ok gyro. You will hear people tell you their favorite pizza place but there's nothing really amazing.  

Bring / buy a bicycle.  There are some great trails in and around TC and there are some fantastic hiking trails too.

The off season is the best time.  Shops have shorter hours.  Most restaurants cut back a bit too.

There are a lot of community groups to get engaged with. If you're bored, it's cause you aren't trying.  NMC student services is strong, take advantage of it. 

Racial / ethnic diversity is lacking in the area.  

Health services are good.  Between NMC, Planned parenthood and Munson you should be able to stay upright. 

The YMCA is a fantastic facility.  NMC has some programs.

"Welcome, friend! I also moved to TC from GR in August to attend NMC. I absolutely love it here. Most shops stay open year round. The beaches/bay are lovely, even in the winter. City is very bike-friendly. My only issue is housing. I have lived on campus since August, and it’s been fine. But the search for affordable, off-campus housing when you don’t know anyone in town is a nightmare. I got lucky and found someone who was also looking for someone to share a house with, and then we found a rental home together at the top of our budget. 
Long story short: great city, great school, housing scene is horrendous.

"You will need roommates and probably 2-3 of them. If you're going to school at nmc, the neighborhood is slightly walkable with a nice park (civic center) in the area. Heavy traffic. BATA is our bus system. Traffic is always heavy in TC, and we're expecting lots of roadwork this upcoming year. There will be delays.

Lyft, GrubHub, door dash, Uber etc is not prevalent here. 

There's plenty of places for you to work.

Expect traffic.

Living here is not cheap, but it's grand fun in the summertime if you don't mind crowds.

A lot of our culture activities are also coming back after the pandemic! Should check out Fulfillament and the TC Film Festival as well as performances at the Old Opera House, City Opera House, and Parallel 45. We've got one of the best libraries in the state.

"TC is a far cry from Chicago, but imagine a far less diverse and much smaller Grand Rapids and that's Traverse City.

Public transportation is poor, though in the warmer months you may be able to get around using a bike fairly well. Much of the city was designed with bikes in mind, but come November (or sooner if you're not tolerant of cold temps) you'll want something else.

Grocery shopping is pretty much like everywhere else. There's a lot of options, though if you want a supercenter, go Meijer or Walmart.

Shops don't close in the off-season, but they may have reduced hours. This is really only for businesses with a tourist-centeric clientele. Gas stations, many restaurants, grocery and clothing stores, etc don't reduce hours.

Best bagels? I guess Meijer's are decent. Big Apple Bagels is okay.

"We just bought a house last year and had to have some large windows replaced. We started out with The Glass Guru, but when we had issues with them not responding to us or showing up to appointments, we switched to Lowe's. Lowe's uses local contractors, so though we got a good rate and Lowe's themselves were super responsive, the subcontractor, The Window Guys, were awful. The installer did a great job, but they were 3 months behind schedule (understandably given the supply and labor shortages).

"I deserve those downvotes. Thanks for helping me find places that have some! It does look like I missed a few. I even asked locals on Facebook and all they said was stuff from 20 mins away lol.

I missed 7 Monks having it, they're not open until 3 pm though.

Hoplot is the 25 mins drive away people recommended. I'm in NMC.

Rarebird's I missed. I probably missed these cause they're bars kinda. I was looking around at restaurants.

B dubs is a chain, not local. I'm talking about locals.

Missed Rico's but tbh figured they only focused on pizza so that's probably why.

Bergstorm doesn't do it. I've checked and been there before. They did it once  but that's it. I asked the owner to bring it back lol

Slabtown is grilled.

I don't see one on Oakwood's menu.

Bubba's is grilled

I need to see how J&S's one is like before ordering it, seems like a regular sandwich compared to just like a burger style chicken sandwich.

I'll definitely check these chicken sandwiches! Any more recommendations?

My point still stands on the breakfast chicken sandwiches though! Biscuit chicken sandwiches are like my favorite. After having biscuits from local places, I still prefer fast food biscuits for some reason.

Also those chains don't compare to CFA chicken sandwiches tbh.

Sorry, I'm a huge chicken sandwich lover and prefer it over burgers. Even a Popeyes chicken sandwich is better than the best burger I've had here for me (Bergstorm).",t2_8qx9z,thenerdal,0,1646838769.0,0,t1_hzzab1b,hzzab1b,False,Artistic_Floof,t3_ta7w1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/traversecity/comments/ta7w1z/guess_what_new_chain_restaurant_opened_to_create/,Guess what new chain restaurant opened to create this long line?

With gas prices rising, that seems way less worth than simply waiting in a long line (that goes pretty quick since CFA is pretty good at that.)

"Which is why I have no choice but to watch it rot. The culture is dead, so there's nothing to save, anyway.

""Embrace change"" is a meaningless platitude thrown around by hippies. It's a cope, not a solution. I could find that tagline on a mug at TJ Maxx. ""Embracing change"" isn't going to make the price of basic necessities go down. It's not going to lower taxes. It won't give me my home back. The town is now populated by people I cannot stand. The affluent pieces of shit who fled from downstate, and west coast political migrants who just want to make another Portland.

If you lived here, you'd know that this town can't grow. Well, it can't *afford* to grow. It's the most geographically unique place in the midwest, and that comes with EXTREME logistical problems. Transportation has been the primary infrastructure issue for this town for over a century. The streets can't get any wider. All the streets that could be built, have been. Any East-West travel in the town is impossible without some mongoloid trying to occupy the same point in space-time as you. They tore up the rail. There are no sidewalks. Whether you ride your bike to work like a guy with a DUI, or drive a car, you're getting to where you need to go at about the same time. If it's only going to get worse, then I'm just going to wait for my property value to peak, and dump the fuck out of it just like the other locals who abandoned town for a quick buck.

Maybe one day you'll understand that change is more often bad than it is good, and that small towns should stay small.

"I'm debating it, but I think I'm going to keep the land I have, and move about an hour out of the way.

The population has grown too much, and I absolutely hate being in asses-to-elbows situations, which is the case everywhere, now. Almost all of the original culture of the town is long gone, and has been replaced by ""Foodies"" who think that going to restaurants is a valid substitute for personality. We have homeless camps, now. We have muggings now. We have a particularly fucking insane hard drug issue now. None of that was a thing even 8 years ago. Going downtown is non-viable for any local, and is just there for the urbanites and tourists. Things cost too much, especially real estate. If you are an honest to god local, you aren't enjoying the festivities. You're working your life away in a dead-end service industry job, if you didn't have a rich husband to open up a shop for you on Front. Oh, and the taxes! Enjoy paying $12000 a year on a third of a fucking acre!

Basically, the problem with Traverse City can be summed up as such: ""You never see New Yorkers going to see the Statue of Liberty. It's not for us, it's for them."" I've had to endure ""it's for them"" rhetoric, regarding all facets of the local area, for at least the last 15 years I've lived here, and possibly longer, but it's also possible that I was paying less attention at the time.

They are tough as nails but I would say that multi media is definitely over emphasising this As well as making Russia look a lot weaker than they actually are which in my opinion is very stupid and very dangerous. I would also say the sanctions are the same way where they (russia and east cuz chinas with them hands down despite MSM claims) have more to hold over our head than we have to hold over theirs. I stand with Ukraine and I think Putin is a scumbag and I am very nervous about how all this is going... The US dollar as global reserve currency is about to fail and Putin and the East know it. What’s to stop China from taking Taiwan? Or which to stop Russia from taking any of the other non NATO countries in europe?

Pretty inspiring but looks like putin is Going to have his way in Ukraine if Biden doesn’t step in along with NATO which already said they aren’t gonna defend the airspace pretty much gift wrapping ukraine to putin along with any other non-NATO countries which he has his eyes on. this is really sad. Our leaders are really incompetent not that Trump was much better we need to get the central banks in the federal reserve who prints all of our money abolished And set up a sound money system that is backed by something and there’s not a fractional reserve system where the banks can print money out of thin air causing inflation which is the most regressive tax there is meaning it affects the poor and helps the wealthy. That’s why we advocate for sound money backed my gold or silver so thet cant print more if it and devalue the peoples savings.. Putin knows that the US dollar is failing as global reserve currency and we have printed way too much and that every fiat (money backed by nothing) since the beginning of time has gone to zero..

"The Tasting Room. 3 courses each and 1 dessert for two. 

First course: a pork belly bao for me and a salmon (or tuna?) tostada for partner, plus one mocktail since they don’t have (and I hear were rejected for) a liquor license. 

Bao was okay but inexplicably was deep-fried like a chalupa. Not what I wanted or expected but okay. 

Tostada was… like sushi that’s not bad but really getting questionable, very fishy. Both apps had the same sriracha mayo that I have in my fridge or could make in under a minute (or close enough to).

Second course, we both got French onion soup. It was serviceable, I make better at home. It suffered from the cheese kind of sitting inside the broth and getting goopy but felt actually homemade, not from a bag. The amount of thyme and what tasted like red wine/vermouth was well balanced. 

Third dish, a seafood risotto and a pulled short rib beef over gnocchi. The beef was okay but not very seasoned, gnocchi was good. My partner had to send back the risotto for being cold (mind you we’ve both been in the industry and have sent food back maybe twice each in our lives.) 

Partner asked if they could just reheat it for a couple minutes, they made it new instead. It was still pretty bad. The texture was good but the flavors were just off. We didn’t finish it and didn’t ask for a to-go box. 

Dessert, bananas foster… not what I’d expect but not bad, a pre-caramelized banana with brown sugar and vanilla bean ice cream.

"There was a different, original Overheard group like a year ago but it got taken down by facebook for some reason, still not sure why. This one popped up in its place and is unfortunately run by total idiots. You could try Overheard in Grand Traverse County, but it's not nearly as active.

"I wrote a long post with the review here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RhF_lSyJBhOo0ueWR6fxpdROd8nqEnZ13Fk0X_YRzsk/edit?usp=drivesdk

Took a while to write it but it got denied so I shortened it and then that's when he messaged me.

I was originally going to be more harsh on Artisan since I didn't really like the first course since it tasted like ceviche on top of store bought guacamole. Since I tagged them in the original post, I thought I'd be nicer.

But he thought I was getting paid for the meals. I even said I'd provide proof of me actually spending the money.

I'm just a huge Foodie and I rarely go out to eat and want to give my thoughts if a place is worth or not.

I'm just super bummed out because I met a lot of helpful people in that group. One of them gave me free welding equipment for my welding class.

Ugh, oh well.

"I did three restaurants!!! McGee’s, Stella and Artisan.

I loved McGee’s the most and thought the standout dish was the basic cookie and ice cream dessert haha, it's the least fanciest dish I've had from all three.

I didn't really like Artisan much tbh. Wasn't really worth it. We ordered extra things and spent about $250....

I have a reservation for Cooks house on Tuesday since they extended it but idk if I'll do it anymore since I already spent so much.

I regret doing Artisan and wish I went to Cooks House instead lol but my friend wanted the Toffee dessert from them. I got the fluffy cheesecake and it really wasn't that fluffy lol.

Overall it was worth it still. I got to try things I've never tried even if I didn't like it. Trying it was what mattered.

I will definitely do it again next year.",t2_8qx9z,thenerdal,0,1645922128.0,0,t1_hykzzw6,hykzzw6,True,viciousbliss,t3_t20k71,https://www.reddit.com/r/traversecity/comments/t20k71/tell_me_about_your_restaurant_week/,Tell me about your Restaurant Week!,/r/traversecity/comments/t20k71/tell_me_about_your_restaurant_week/hykzzw6/,3,r/traversecity,0,3

"On front street on the main strip. Let me google it….  Ah, “Mama Lu’s”. We did not have bad service, The margaritas were pretty good, the food was bad. Which is weird, everyone seems to like this place. I am from Traverse but currently live in Los Angeles, so maybe that’s part of it, the Mexican food is very good out here. Although Agave is in Traverse, that place isn’t bad. Super cheesy, but the food is decent. La Senorita is good. Qdoba is fast food, but better than Mama Lu’s. 

(Edit, I think part of it was the quality to price ratio as well, it was just my wife and I, and after tip it was something ridiculous like $70+ dollars… for a few tacos and two margaritas. An authentic street taco in LA is 2-3 dollars and goddamn delicious.)",t2_4pifyqh9,Laws_Laws_Laws,0,1645914241.0,0,t1_hyki3te,hyki3te,False,viciousbliss,t3_t20k71,https://www.reddit.com/r/traversecity/comments/t20k71/tell_me_about_your_restaurant_week/,Tell me about your Restaurant Week!,/r/traversecity/comments/t20k71/tell_me_about_your_restaurant_week/hyki3te/,1,r/traversecity,0,1
