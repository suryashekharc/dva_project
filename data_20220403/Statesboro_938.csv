"Welcome to the ‘Boro! I’m also from Hilton Head. There’s a nice scene in the downtown area for us “older” folks (I’m in my 30s too). Eagle Creek Brewing has live and game nights.

Hey fellow atheist! I first moved to statesboro when I came to Georgia and there is an atheist group in statesboro. They’re small but when I was living there they were nice. I eventually moved to Savannah and got with the group there. They’re bigger and the people I met there are lifelong friends.

"There are many things to do in Statesboro. Grice Connect on Facebook lists activities happening during the week. The Publix grocery store will be open in the fall.

Lots of great, local musicians and live music at the local restaurants and hangouts. Statesboro is small enough to be friendly and you can go anywhere in town in 15-20 minutes BUT it is also big enough that you can be anonymous. This is important to me because I love my dog more than I like people, too. We love to go to the state parks that are just a quick 30 minute drive.

"Someone at my apartment found him outside the Hudson apartment complex, watched him for a week, then he was back outside my apartment building. He’s a puppy, seems to be about 8-10 months, and has been staying with my boyfriend and I for a few days. He’s the absolute sweetest, we’ve named him Hank and he already knows it, does pretty well in a crate (he loves to cuddle on the bed at night and refuses to stay on the floor), and so playful. He’s teething since he’s a puppy but he hasn’t broken skin and is otherwise extremely well behaved! He’s pretty timid in big spaces but when he feels safe he has such an adorable personality. 

Neither my boyfriend or I can really afford a dog right now, especially a large breed puppy, so the plan is to take him to the Savannah Humane Society where he will get neutered and all other regular vaccines and hopefully because he’s a puppy will be adopted quickly, but I thought I’d see if anyone in town was interested in giving this baby a loving home!",t2_dept2dr8,eebibeeb,0,1647543325.0,0,t1_i11yeup,i11yeup,True,eebibeeb,t3_tgh7rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/statesboro/comments/tgh7rj/this_sweet_puppy_needs_to_be_adopted_info_in/,This sweet puppy needs to be adopted!

"depends on exactly where you're looking to move. If you're going to an apartment that runs off of ""free wifi"" for the building, you're SOL. I'm out in brooklet, and I get Gig Fiber Speeds from Vyvyee/Northlands Communications. Bulloch Telephone Cooperative has gig speeds as well, although iirc they're a bit more expensive. I pay $98 a month with Vyvee. Really just depends on if where you're moving  has access to the fiber lines. 

*-Oh, and if you don't already have one, go ahead and buy a  reputable router or a high end mesh router setup.  Can get a handful of setups for under $500-$1000 depending on the size of your living space.* 

*Most issues people seem to have with their internet even though they pay for good speeds, are the result of using only the modem/router combo provided by the isp. Even the best of those units (at least, what you're gonna get from your provider) start to drop connections after 10 devices have connected to it.  Don't expect to get fast speeds unless you're hardwired via ethernet, or just a few feet from the modem unless you've got a high end router setup. Anything over 1,500sqft would likely benefit from a good mesh router setup. A lot of people don't realize the importance of dropping $400-$1000 on the hardware to make 100mb-1000mb+ achievable in real world usage within your home. -*",t2_7rqsqe56,LayerLess,0,1638695377.0,0,t1_hnb0nuc,hnb0nuc,True,McKaylaneyy,t3_qxhyxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/statesboro/comments/qxhyxd/best_internet/,Best internet?,/r/statesboro/comments/qxhyxd/best_internet/hnb0nuc/,3,r/statesboro,0,3

"Crime in Statesboro is typical for a city of it's size. As others have mentioned the college apartment and lower income areas have a higher rate of petty and violent crime. As far as the public school system goes I think Bulloch County provides plenty of opportunity and support to it's students. It's really all about taking advantage of those opportunities. We are fortunate enough to have three colleges, Georgia Southern University, East Georgia College, and Ogeechee Technical College. High school students can take classes at all three (I am not 100% sure about OTC but I think they offer this too) for free while they are in high school.  We have three private schools, Bulloch Academy, Trinity Christian School and Bible Baptist Christian School. Bulloch Academy was founded as a segregation academy and to this day remains quite segregated, as do the other two. I had the pleasure of leading a leadership class for high schoolers from all the schools in Bulloch. I felt the most impressive, well rounded, socially adjusted students came from Statesboro High. When posed the question why they wanted to join the class an overwhelming majority of the BA students replied that they wanted to make more diverse friends. They craved friends who weren't just like them, upper middle class whites. Don't get me wrong, the BA students often have high GPAs and go on to be very successful but I'm not so sure that doesn't have a lot to do with already having a leg up economically. BA has a VERY active sports program. Don't expect that from the other two private schools, they don't have the budget for it. We also have a public charter school, Statesboro STEAM - College, Careers, Arts, and Technology Academy.  They specialize in students that might need a more hands on approach to learning, who don't do well in a lecture type classroom setting. 

Education makes up the largest portion of our economy, agribusiness is the next largest. We have a very active Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Development Authority, and Development Authority of Bulloch County.   On the first Friday of every month the DDA holds F1rst Friday Downtown with a different theme each month (starting again soon due to COVID).  We have a great little farmer's market that will soon be held in their brand new building behind the welcome center. We have a new arena used for livestock shows, rodeos and hopefully one day concerts will be held there. The Averitt Arts Center has some pretty good shows and often pulls from local talent. We have the Willie McTell trail and a local dog park. There are plenty of social and non-profit organizations to join.  Our recreation department puts on a fireworks show every year for July 4th and recently hosted a lazer show which I heard was phenomenal. We also have an annual fair put on by our local Kiwanis Club.  We have a professional soccer team, Tormenta FC, and their new stadium is under construction (they've had some set backs but we are anxiously awaiting the completion.  Publix has agreed to build beside the stadium). 

If all of that isn't enough to invite you to our town, geographically speaking Statesboro is perfect. As others have said, you're an hour from historic Savannah, an hour and a half from Tybee Island, a couple of hours away from the lake, and 3 or 4 hours from Atlanta or the mountains.  George L. Smith State Park and Magnolia Springs State Park are both a short drive away.  The city of Augusta is only an hour and a half away. In Augusta and Savannah you can expect top rated medical care.  Here's a fun fact for you!  Statesboro is home to one of the highest rated drug and alcohol rehab centers in the nation, Willingway Hospital.  We have a large and active sober community. Many make their way here via the hospital and choose to make Statesboro their home. As far as the comment about local bars and fake IDs goes, since the unfortunate death of Michael Gatto in 2014 Statesboro cards everyone. So much so that sometimes Walmart won't let you buy alcohol if you have a minor with you. Of course as with anything sometimes things slip through the cracks but I'm carded so often in Statesboro that when I travel to other places I'm surprised when I don't get carded.  Bulloch County is a dry county so you can only purchase beer, wine and liquor by the drink. A vote to allow liqour sales is upcoming but every time it's voted on it gets shot down. Fingers crossed for a favorable outcomes this time. 

Hope this helps. Sorry for the info overload.  If you have any questions DM me.

Edit to add: I'm also in my early 40s with one child in high school and one in college.

"It's generally safe, except for some college apartment areas and run down neighborhoods in the city. 

Statesboro public schools aren't the greatest. The town of Brooklet has better schools. There's a good private school in Statesboro though called Bulloch Academy. 

I would suggest looking at houses in Bulloch County, not in city limits. There are some really nice neighborhoods outside of town, especially around Forest Heights Country Club.

The historic downtown scene is growing and there are fun local events like the farmers market. Cute boutiques, coffee shop, arts center, etc.

"pretty safe town. I would be careful about being out late at night though. It really depends on where you live. some of the student apartment complexes have had shootings, deaths, and break-ins in the last few years. there’s also been a lot of crime over near the big walmart, stadium drive road, and the waffle houses. 

I would also keep a close eye on your kid, if they’re the party type. Statesboro is a college town and fake ids are easy to find. It’s even easier to get into the bars (the shitty ones don’t even id anymore). 

Other than that, it’s a nice town. Pretty boring because there’s not a lot to do, but it’s only an hour away from Savannah and hour and a half away from Tybee Island. The town itself is pretty dead in the summer because very few college kids stick around. Super busy fall-spring.

Most apartment complexes should have a 24/7 study area, but you would need someone who lives there to be able to let you in to use it.

Nor would I go to the one on Northside Drive. I've had plenty of 2am Waffle House trips to those two locations, and they can be pretty sketchy late at night.

"Definitely not a ghost town, so that will be a nice change for you! 

We are home of Georgia Southern University (go Eagles!) That would be a fun afternoon of walking around, because it's literally the most gorgeous campus. Statesboro is a college town, so from May-August & December-Early January, there is a lot less population. But with that being said, make note of move-in dates & avoid the Walmarts at all costs. 

Speaking of Walmarts, we have 2 Walmarts (big walmart, smallmart), an Aldi's, a soon to be Food Lion, we will also eventually have a Publix which is !!! Woohoo!! There's a lot of stuff that's in the works, like we are getting a Planet Fitness, a new IMAX movie theatre, & again, the Publix!! 

Downtown is cool! There's a few nicer restaurants, a brewery, a local theatre/arts center that's doing COVID safe shows, & some cute stores. 

Other fun stuff to do is the Clubhouse, which has laser tag, go-karts, arcades, bowling - to quote their logo 'where fun is done' which I agree. 

Our mall is very sad. Be prepared to online shop. There's another strip that has a Books a Million, TJ Maxx, Hobby Lobby, Ulta, etc. which is nice but still not a lot of options. 

El Sombrero is a must. There are 3 separate locations for you to select from. 

Coffee here is AWESOME - we got Three Tree, Cool Beanz, the Daily Grind, all very great in their own ways & highly recommend. 

Also for pizza, I highly recommend Zoner's. Very good. Holiday's is also a stable but not my personal favorite. (good calzones tho!) 

We also got 3rd place in ABC, America's Best Community's in 2015, so that money is going towards the Blue Mile, which is Main Street from the college to the courthouse. Renovations are happening along that road which is exciting! 

I think that's all I got. I hope other fellow Boro folks chime in!

"Friday is Board Game night at Galactic Comics and Games.

Statesboro Unlocked is a puzzle room thing you can do with a small group.

First Friday of every month has something going on beside the courthouse. Changes every month.

The Clubhouse has mini golf, laser tag, bowling and stuff.  
Plus I heard the game people from galactic comics and games meets there every other Monday for games and drinks.

There's the paint ball and trampoline place in the north part of town.

There's an art gallery and small theatre near the court house area.

I think GSU runs a ""makerspace"" in the same area. Last I heard it was open to students the community for a materials fee or something.

The fair grounds on Fair Road seems to have something every couple of weeks. Next up is a rodeo if the sign is right.

Other than that, nothing but bars in Statesboro.",t2_amuge,neefvii,0,1491779833.0,0,t1_dg1uvzp,dg1uvzp,True,immaturekangaroo,t3_64fly1,https://www.reddit.com/r/statesboro/comments/64fly1/anything_at_all/,Anything at all??,/r/statesboro/comments/64fly1/anything_at_all/dg1uvzp/,5,r/statesboro,0,5

"The Averitt Center for the Arts have shows and art galleries, as does Georgia Southern. The Averitt spans over several buildings downtown, including a gift shop, TWO theaters, a ballet studio and soon a ceramics/visual arts studio. ""Now And Then"" was filmed in Statesboro and some scenes at the Averitt.

The local comic book shop (Galactic Comic and Games) has a great atmosphere and has a great history. They started from a little corner of a pawn shop and then grew and grew. I'm sure some employee there will be able to give you a more concrete timeline.

I'll also second the GSU Wildlife Center. I volunteered there for a few summers and the place rocks.

I'd also check out the medical center pharmacy, as odd as that sounds. There's a tiny little restaurant in the back and the food is phenomenal. Especially the milkshakes. Exclusively at the Granade St location though.
