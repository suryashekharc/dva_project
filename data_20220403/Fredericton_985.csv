"Great thought üôè. 

Before you use the free time for that, try defining what is affordable housing?. It's a very subjective term. What is affordable to you might not be affordable to me. Economical situations and other conditions in life vary. Look at the construction data for residential properties in NB. Maybe you would understand why rents are going up. Eventually you might also get to understand that you probably would have got confused with ""rent"" issues here in NB rather than affordability. 

However, both are critical and impactful elements in common man's life. I wouldn't know all the answers as I'm no expert in that. 

Food for thought: if there are surplus properties in the area, would there be an issue to get a rental or will the rents increase when supply is high?. I would think it will not, as this is the basis of a supply and demand issue. One solution would be to provide the general public with incentives to build more houses and the contractors and tradesmen who exploit up the situation to be a bit more HUMANE.",t2_i8i16t1o,jackspwroe,0,1648838873.0,0,t1_i30mteq,i30mteq,True,m0bin16,t3_tttgbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericton/comments/tttgbj/getting_involved_with_affordable_housing_advocacy/,Getting involved with affordable housing advocacy?,/r/fredericton/comments/tttgbj/getting_involved_with_affordable_housing_advocacy/i30mteq/,2,r/fredericton,0,2

">So your argument for no skateboards on the sidewalk is someone you know got hit by a bike?

No, that's just a contributing factor to my preference. Your personal experience and ability does not really sway my opinion on the more broader experience and ability of other skaters.

If I have a sidewalk packed with pedestrians the worst I can expect is a shoulder barge. With a group of skateboarders, inline skaters, roller skaters, longboarders or whatever I think it's reasonable to expect if I was run into I could be knocked to the ground and maybe injured.

Allowing skaters on the sidewalk has no guarantees of the skill level or respectful nature of the rider, nor does it allow for control of the number of skaters moving through pedestrians. I've seen groups of 5+ teens bombing down the sidewalk on their boards, they don't give a crap at all, fakie kickflips and sick nose grinds is not something to do amongst folks walking with a coffee and their grandma.

So yeah, my preference would be to have a bylaw prohibiting wheels on sidewalks. Skating is recreation, not transportation. Get a bike or walk.

"I recently struggled with a similar situation. Is it the full diagnostic report you‚Äôre looking for or simply just treatment / relief?

It‚Äôs night and day for most folks with ADHD getting the proper medication. I took the route of the latter after a few quotes from private mental health services - some were in the $1000s.

"Where's the Victory Health Centre?

You can call (5064532132) or go in person to the Horizon Addictions & Mental Health Services building - back entrance of the old hospital, across the cul-de-sac from the building with the men's shelter and community kitchen.

You can fill out a form and talk to someone who will determine who you should see and make an appointment - it could be awhile. I was 6 months before talking to somebody, but I was a low-to-no risk case.

You meet with a psychiatrist and they evaluate you partially by interview and partially by assessment materials. Then you get a diagnosis and prescription.

I believe it's covered by the province, but I also have non-insured health benefits through INAC, so I'm not sure. Whatever your situation, make sure you get prescribed the generic brands of whatever medication if you go that way. Much cheaper if you have to pay, much more likely to be covered by third party insurance.

"You have a good point, unfortunately, in Fredericton if you are a middle-class owner, this might be difficult. Our house was built in the late 50 and needed quite a bit of work. Since there were major issues with the foundation (estates sale, no recourse for us once we discovered the problem), we spend a lot of money on it and had to wait before doing anything else. Anyway, long story short, when we decided to do some renovations only one contractor replied to our request for a quote. Since we live in a small bungalow, my husband thinks that the contractors were not interested in working on such a small house. We ended up having to deal with a contractor that did a poor job. We had to be on his case all the time, and my husband even stayed home to make sure the workers were not screwing up the work.

"I've dealt with 2 I would stay away from:

1. Tom Hughes Roofing - Pulled so many crooked tricks I'm not sure I even remember them all. The most important thing though, he covered up rot, reused the bent drip edge but charged for new, finished the mansards completely wrong, and used nails that were too short. The roof started falling apart after less than 3 weeks which is when I found out that the 10 year warranty he promised was less than worthless. In the end I had a yard full of nails and pieces of shingles, a leaking roof with shingles falling off weekly, and the paint and windshield of my car destroyed from getting hit with shingles. A year later I finally got Tom back to the house by calling from a different phone number and pretending to be a new customer, when he realized the roof he was criticizing was his own work he tried to get in my face and intimidate me. 
2. Poolboy - Came recommended by our realtor to inspect a hot tub before we bought our house. He assured us that everything worked perfectly, but when we moved in the tub would not heat above 85 degrees. After repeated calls it turned out that his ""Inspection"" was flipping the breaker on and making sure the light for the heater came on. $1500 later, we had a functioning hot tub.",t2_ehhcsye,Pismehoff,0,1648475215.0,0,t1_i2fqjbz,i2fqjbz,True,Other_Seesaw_4206,t3_tpmevy,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericton/comments/tpmevy/local_contractors/,Local contractors,/r/fredericton/comments/tpmevy/local_contractors/i2fqjbz/,2,r/fredericton,0,2

Standard policy should be to get at least three quotes (if not more), but also get clear timelines/benchmarks for when the project phases begin/end and when payments will be issued as these benchmarks are achieved, assuming you‚Äôre not being billed solely at end which is rare these days.
Always get a materials list, buy them yourself and have them delivered to your site and keep tabs on them, extra can be returned/saved for your use not on contractors next job.  And there should be extra b/c that‚Äôs how you should have ordered.  You never want contractors waiting on materials.

"Apples are probably the fruit that likes this region the best, mainly comes down to getting a good one. Trees can be really finnicky, and there's a LOT of varieties of apples of variable performance.

Personally, I would seriously consider just getting a ""fruit salad tree"" (basically one where they go insane on grafting and have like 4-6 different fruits) from one of the local nurseries and just see what happens if you're not looking to start an orchard.

"He was a landlord I had back in 03-04. It was a shit hole but it was all we could afford as full time students. Besides his inability to fix anything properly or in a timely manner or at all, or the fact that he sent his daughters to come clean the place a week after we had moved in because the previous tenants wrecked the joint, he also never submitted our damage deposit to a rentalsman. When we moved out he said he wouldn't release our deposit because of a bunch of damage that had been there before us that he never came to fix. We didn't find out he didn't submit our deposit until we contacted the rentalsman over this matter. I called him and told him we knew what he did and he said something to the effect of ""well I never give deposits to rentalsman because they can't be trusted"". After about an hour of arguing he finally agreed to write us personal checks to the amount of our damage deposit. He gave them all to me by hand the following day,with a serious attitude.  

Aaaand then he cancelled the checks and turned his phone off.  

Luckily one of my roommates was not only in Law at UNB but his gf (now wife) was the daughter of the Campbell's and after some threats of legal action he wrote us more checks. Took us almost 5 months to get our money back. I knew ppl who rented from him since then and he also didn't submit the deposit for them either, which is why I asked if it was Habib.",t2_fqlk4,moneenerd,0,1648245201.0,0,t1_i24c7s4,i24c7s4,False,[deleted],t3_tncps7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericton/comments/tncps7/landlord_didnt_submit_my_damage_deposit_to_the/,Landlord didnt submit my damage deposit to the rentalsman,/r/fredericton/comments/tncps7/landlord_didnt_submit_my_damage_deposit_to_the/i24c7s4/,1,r/fredericton,0,1

If you did find my Twitch profile, please understand that that the persona I have there won't be like my written text. Also if you could not mention that again I'd be thankful. This is where ill speak of my real name.  


So with that, you can call me Drew if you like. I don't need a perfect sheild of Anon-such. I just got out of 2SE and I have C-PTSD and Psychosis. I'm looking for a support network in this city. I was not born here but I came here sometime in grade school. I always played games more then I should and dreamed of being a pilot or a astro-janitor or something..

&#x200B;

I'm willing to work for exposure. For free. For now. I have dreams for our city.

&#x200B;

I wish I could draw, or paint, but i shake too much. So thats why I'm looking for an artist. I love wolves. Theres more to the request then that but I don't want blind offers. 

&#x200B;

Forgive any spelling errors as well. School was School for me.

&#x200B;

Hates a strong word but rigid support is what I need, if you want to counter me and critizise its perfect its what I need. But know I do feel what you say. You matter to me now whomever you are. We don't need to be friends or anything. If you know someone in graphic deisgn and is willing to work out terms and explain copyright to me... i'd love to get to work. Wolves. Third Eye.

"ugh this, like COVID or not if you're sick, you shouldn't be working in a kitchen, full stop. You're handling people's food for god's sakes. I know sometimes we gotta work but COVID really should have been a reminder/wake-up call that we need to stop expecting people to work when they're sick, full stop - and that there should be reasonable accommodations when an employee has to take sick leave. Hot take, but if an employee having to take a few days off while sick topples your whole system, then your business clearly isn't properly staffed/managed, period.

It just exposes how fucked up capitalism is at its core - an employee should never have to worry about missing their rent payments if they're sick, a business should never be so understaffed that they can't handle someone being out on sick leave, and employees that are well shouldn't hate their job so much or be compensated so little that they aren't willing to cover shifts for sick employees. It's a very multi-layered problem.

"> I'm looking for people just starting out. Anyone who is willing to share anything. 

In what context?

I appear to have conflated you with the guy looking for an artist to support his new Twitch channel for free... which is an error... but the base comment stands - artists are entitled to compensation for their work as much as any other skilled labourer, and offers to trade artwork for ""exposure"" are worthless and insulting

If you are offering to provide critical feedback on artwork, with no expectation of retaining the art afterwards (or commissioning the work in the first place)... OK, I guess. That's not ""insulting"", but lacking any insight as to why your critique, specifically, offers value (Are you a retired art gallery director? A former ad executive who managed an art department?) I don't imagine many will be eager to take you up on that offer.

"Long covid affects 10% to 30% and can be debilitating.  Source: two different people I know. One newly retired who can't do anything more in a day than walk to the mailbox, and another in her 30s who has had to cut her weekend social life completely out because she basically can make it through a week of office work and then needs to be in bed all weekend.
Imagine that's your 4 year old kid who still can't get vaxxed.

Most of the people I know who got covid did not have these symptoms and have recovered ok.

"My previous landlord informed me that some home-owners either don't know or refuse to deal with the government. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case given the ghosting and stuff that's gone on.

Here's what to do:

&#x200B;

**1) Contact (preferably call) the landlord with a final warning.** Inform them that you know your rights. A damage deposit MUST have been submitted to the Rentalsman within 14 days of your moving in. Whereas you did not receive a receipt or tenancy number form the Rentalsman and the Rentalsman's Office doesn't have anything, your landlord violated the Residential Tenancies Act. This means they're in some pretty deep trouble if they don't give you your money (and can still be in trouble regardless).

&#x200B;

**2. Regardless of whether you get your money, contact the Rentalsman and tell them everything** (incl. the landlord ducking you). When you do, you should have a copy of your lease and some form of proof of your e-transfer to the landlord. They will ensure you get your money back and probably ensure that they don't get away with it in the future. If you already got your money through 1, do this anyway.

"Management of the FIP isnt great (or atleast wosent the last time I worked there), the guards tend to be pushed through their certifications there so they can be given job offers to fill empty schedual slots, at least pre covid the locker rooms and pool area were like never cleaned, and almost always only got a hose down at the end of the night. I saw a lot of gross acts of negligence there by guards, and anyone that made a fuss about it or didnt kiss up to the boss (who was never there) got kicked to the curb after a couple years there. A lot of the good guards at the FIP often end up migrating over to the Y once they get tired of the bs.
