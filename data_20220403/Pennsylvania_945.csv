While this was obviously a quite bad thing to do for Fetterman, considering the fact that the victim literally endorsed Fetterman's senate bid... if the guy that was victimized can forgive him, so can I.

Then I look at Conor Lamb and see a corporate stooge that is being funded by super PAC's to oppose making healthcare affordable or any other semblance of progress. [Source](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/21/pennsylvania-primary-super-pac-00018771)

I'm going to take a hard pass on Lamb. The last thing Pennsylvania needs is to run another yuppie Mt. Lebanon lawyer who 80% of the state cannot identify with - against another yuppie hedge fund Republican who 95% of the state also can't identify with.

All so Lamb can head to Washington and vote down any attempt at progressive policies that would benefit his entire constituency.

"What makes you think people aren’t already doing this? We have a very robust medical program serving hundreds of thousands. We also have millions of people convicted of other various drug crimes in the last few years - what is going to stop your average meth head from driving high?  

It’s like guns. You can’t stop it, so don’t ban it. Nothing is going to stop the criminals from breaking the law, whether it’s getting a gun illegally or getting weed illegally and driving. 

Best option is to tax it and make sure our police force is well trained and funded so they can get the worst apples off the roads. 

Also - legalizing weed doesn’t lead to an increase in DUI arrests across the board, as countless other states have indicated. And weed inhibits your ability to drive a whole lot less than alcohol.

"> Is it illegal to just “be high” in Pennsylvania?

Marijuana is federally illegal so on the one hand, federally, no, it's not legal. If you have a medical license and you are using cannabis as prescribed and within the bounds of PA State law, in your own home, then you can be ""high"" in PA.

You are not allowed to drive or operate a vehicle while high.

You CAN be arrested for public intoxication if you are high out in public. 

So then the question becomes:  ""How are they gonna know you are high in public?""

Well that is the real issue. No one knows by looking at me if I took my Prozac this a.m. If I am at the bank, no one is going to arrest me for being too jacked on caffeine. And in almost 35 years of me smoking weed on the regular, no one has ever arrested me for it in public. you know why? Because when I am high in public, I act like a person and not a loudmouth jackass. 

So I guess my question is, how the hell are people going to know you're high? Because unless you are going around telling everyone, or acting like stoned hooligans, no one would know anyway.",t2_ha75q4gz,MyDucksAreCute,0,1648991857.0,0,t1_i37xk12,i37xk12,True,joey_cel,t3_tun55l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tun55l/in_an_argument_with_my_friend_in_the_state_of/,"In an argument with my friend, in the state of Pennsylvania, is it illegal to be high in public?",/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tun55l/in_an_argument_with_my_friend_in_the_state_of/i37xk12/,1,r/Pennsylvania,0,1

"Lived in Chesco for most of my life. This is my home.

Oxford is a lot like Lancaster, lots of amish and there are some strange ""families"" down there that do shady stuff like crime and incest. Feels like central PA in some ways. It is also WAY out there and although I live in Exton (center Chesco), it takes me longer to get to Oxford (\~50 min) than Philadelphia (\~40-45).

Towards the Delaware state border it can get kinda crummy, lots of traffic and dumpy buildings. In between there are some beautiful horse farms and estates

Kennett square is nice, though there are a few massive mushroom farm operations in the area that can smell. There are also a great deal of immigrants there (whether illegal or legal), the center of town is quite nice its like a smaller West Chester

Between Oxford and Kennett square is basically farm land and not much else going on, maybe Nottingham?

If you consider Parkesburg southern chesco, I generally think that place sucks. Boring town with nothing going on. Also the buildings look horrible.

Best bet is West Chester, if you can afford it. Nice vibrant town and there is a ton to do. Very strong community feel to it, with events constantly. There is also a good mix of young and old there. Just outside of West Chester there are some nice spots.

If you want better access to the city either go for something closer to the Delaware border (for I-95) or some place like Devon/Malvern where you have access to 476/76.",t2_5bwk9rlz,Cupcake332,0,1648952208.0,0,t1_i36b1bm,i36b1bm,True,[deleted],t3_tuxgam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tuxgam/what_are_your_thoughts_on_southern_chester_county/,What are your thoughts on Southern Chester County?,/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tuxgam/what_are_your_thoughts_on_southern_chester_county/i36b1bm/,1,r/Pennsylvania,0,1

"Maybe you should investigatedthese things? The majority of most school district funding is local property taxes and local earned income taxes. In large urban district the majority (more than 50%) maybe federal but I don’t know off the top of my head. 

The proposal to “fix” these issues is to eliminate/significantly reduce local property taxes and replace it w/ higher state income taxes, sales tax, and other taxes - like sin taxes. 

This model would eliminate local control over taxation/revenue raising and would benefit some districts, but defiantly fuck over the districts that already have high per pupil expenditures because the community has engaged in raising property taxes (and local earned income taxes) to fix their own local problems.

Most of these funding formulas would rely a variety of metrics (which are rather complicated) to determine who gets how much state taxes - but the proposal often involve a calculations of net household income  within a community and funding being tied to that - resulting in poorer communities get more and wealthier getting less per pupil. 

Which makes sense, until you realize the “less” would have to result in re-opening of collective bargaining agreements and union concessions to make up for the “less” because 2/3rds of must district budgets are salaries/benefits. 

Of course, if they don’t eliminate the property taxes altogether (vs drastically reduce) local community will again slowly raise taxes to fill in the gaps created by “less”. 

This assumes PA can survive the first (of many) lawsuits the vast majority of school district will fill demanding and injunction on eliminating/reducing the property taxation schemes of democratic elected school board members across the 500 schools districts in the state of PA. 

In other words, it most certainly will never happen, and it will continue to be an effort to “pander/buy” the votes of seniors who want lowers taxes and democrats who what a “fair funding formula”.",t2_jngnx,ScienceWasLove,0,1648944438.0,0,t1_i362p1w,i362p1w,False,Open_Veins_8,t3_tuhrfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tuhrfr/pennsylvanias_school_funding_scheme_creates_a/,Pennsylvania’s School Funding Scheme Creates a Permanent Underclass.

"Yes, the disparity is a problem and needs to be addressed, but one of the many things that makes this discussion challenging is that no one seems to know what a good budget for a school looks like.

There's also seems be a lot of low hanging fruit to save money. Every(?) district has dedicated staff to work on the curriculum, instead of handling that at the county or state level. Every district has a very well paid superintendent, despite no one being able to explain what that person does in that role. Every district has an army of support staff, despite there not being evidence to show that the increased number of support staff helps kids learn (my district has 1 non-teaching person for every 2 teachers).

He supports ALL their shit like overturning the 2020 election (but of course not their own wins, mind you), assaulting the integrity of our elections, but he's quieter about it AND he's the chair of the State Government committee so he holds quite a bit of power.",t2_48eyw,themollusk,0,1648914642.0,0,t1_i34b8up,i34b8up,False,No-Pomegranate4735,t3_tuctce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/tuctce/pa_republicans_eye_greater_control_over/,Pa.

"Yes you are able to work some after you’re awarded disability, especially if your condition has improved, but it is extremely difficult to be awarded Social Security disability while still working because the SSA defines “disabled” as the inability to work in any capacity.  It really puts people in a bind because of course you have bills to pay so you’re pushing yourself to work to stay afloat, meanwhile the SSA sees it as you being able to work thus denying the claim.  As for the unemployment you have to be physically able to accept employment in order to qualify under most circumstances (again, why people who get hurt or sick and have to be off don’t qualify for UC) but maybe there are circumstances that consider.  It’s good you’re working with an attorney.  I work in human services and am just relaying what I have witnessed over they years in regards to individuals I work with being approved/denied for benefits.  You can look up the SSA disability criteria on their website to get an idea of how vases are evaluated and what conditions are expedited in the process.  On a personal note my late mother was awarded Social Security within just a few months, but she was 58 and diagnosed with an aggressive illness that ended up terminal within a year and a half, so cases like that are expedited whereas I’ve seen people you are younger and could utilize OVR to train and change careers to something they are able to do denied SSA but end up attending free classes to train for something they’re are able to do despite their disability.

"""While the congressional and state Senate maps remain largely unchanged, the new state House map adds several seats that could be won by Democrats to account for population shifts that occurred over the past decade.""

The article goes on to explain how the recently approved redistricting is slightly in favor for the GOP. But because the GOP has lost so many voters the last 10 years, the GOP is looking to do whatever it can to remain in power

""Seth Grove (R., York), who has proposed replacing the panel with a new commission whose decisions could be overturned by the legislature, which is currently controlled by Republicans.""

-Unfortunately the running theme for the republican/GOP representatives going forward seems to be that they will clean house and run-whoever out of office they please who doesn't completely align with whatever their political ideologies are

""State Sen. Dave Argall (R., Schuylkill) has his own ideas about changing how the legislative maps are drawn. He plans to propose a constitutional amendment that would force the state Supreme Court to select a chair, at random, from currently active senior judges from the lower appellate courts. He argues this change would make the decision less political.""

-Statistics don't lie, and a random chance of winning is better than no chance. If Republican/GOP senators are proposing that instead of actually letting a free and fair democracy elect a majority representative, but instead are just asking for a random chance of having any judge be choosen for promotion from local to Supreme court.

""Argall also intends to introduce an amendment that would prohibit counting people in state prisons at their last known address rather than at the facility where they are incarcerated, a practice known as prison gerrymandering.""

Again, the Republican/GOP party seems to be trying to take the state by force from the local courts up to the federal and then COMPLETELY rewrite American law book to however they see fit.

"I am no traffic attorney but I once had similar questions to what you have and i know some stuff about the law.. From what I understand the bus driver has 48 hours from when the supposed offense occured to report this to the local law enforcement agency. From there the officers will investigate. If they feel an offense has occured the officer will give this this to a magistrate. The magistrate will then have a citation sent out. I believe they have 30 days to send you a citation but those rules i think can change. A lawyer once told me on avvo.com it takes sometimes as long as 30-45 to receive a citation in the mail.  

When you are on a undivided road you must stop if the red lights are on and the stop arm is out. You may have committed a violation. 

The penalties for this are stiff. From what I understand someone who is convicted of this faces a 2 months suspension on thier drivers license, 5 points on thier record and a fine.

"It's a little outside of Pittsburgh proper, but Alle-Kiski Area Hope Shelter in Tarentum https://www.akhopecenter.org/  has a specific program to shelter people and their pets. I'm not sure if their assistance is what you're looking for, but if they cannot help they will likely have other resources for you!

Humane Animal Rescue works with the Pittsburgh chapter of Street Dog Coalition ( https://www.thestreetdogcoalition.org/pittsburgh-pa ) to provide vet care and vaccinations to the pets of homeless persons. Not sure how to pursue such services, but contacting HAR would be the best place to start: 412.345.0348 for the Pet Helpline - just leave a message with your questions and they'll get back to you within 48 hours usually. 

HAR also has a ""pet food pantry"" that allows you to pick up a month's worth of food for your pup. You just have to call and sign up to pick it up on the given date, but it costs nothing. 412.345.7300 x 290 for Ellie's Pet Pantry

Operation Safety Net also works with the Street Dog Coalition folks to assist homeless people who have pets - Operation Safety Net is run by Pittsburgh Mercy and they will also have other resources for you: https://www.pittsburghmercy.org/homeless-services/pittsburgh-mercys-operation-safety-net/

"My mother was a school bus driver for 25 years and I usually rode her bus for convenience's sake. That being said, and in my experience with other drivers, bus drivers will absolutely do everything they can to get the license plates of people who think the stop sign doesn't apply to them and a lot of the kids like to help out with getting the plates.

I went to court at least a dozen times as a witness for people running the reds, and I know my mother went more times than that. 

If the road is not divided by a physical barrier YOU MUST STOP. The stop sign on a bus is the exact same as a stop sign at an intersection. It doesn't matter if your driveway/turn/whatever is only a few feet past the bus you don't move until that bus turns it's ambers and reds off and the sign begins to fold away or is turned off. This is for the children's safety which is far more important than anything else. No matter if they're crossing the road or not. 

If your plates are gotten, the bus driver WILL report to their manager who WILL report you to the police and you WILL wind up in court where you'll be lucky to walk out with your license.

So OP, you did the correct thing, the drivers who stopped behind you did the correct thing, the assholes who passed you did not.",t2_13p3bnl1,daos_6,0,1648854691.0,0,t1_i31mzzv,i31mzzv,True,I_Like_Trains1543,t3_ttz92w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/ttz92w/did_i_just_break_the_school_bus_law_on_my_way_home/,Did I just break the school bus law on my way home?,/r/Pennsylvania/comments/ttz92w/did_i_just_break_the_school_bus_law_on_my_way_home/i31mzzv/,14,r/Pennsylvania,0,14

"The 5 members have been reinstated 


Dear WCASD Families and Community, 

Earlier today, the Chester County Court of Common Pleas heard oral arguments on the motion for reconsideration of the order issued on Tuesday, March 29, which removed five WCASD school board members. At the conclusion of the arguments, the court ruled from the bench to vacate the earlier order, and has since issued a written order.

The order issued today, April 1, reinstates the five school board members to their elected positions. As more information regarding the ongoing legal proceedings becomes available to share, I will be sure to keep everyone up to date.

I again want to thank our families and community for your continued patience and support. As I mentioned in the April District Newsletter, even in the midst of uncertainty we have so much to be grateful for and I look forward to better and brighter things to come. 

Sincerely,

“If physical barriers such as grassy medians, guide rails or concrete median barriers separate oncoming traffic from the bus, motorists in the opposing lanes may proceed without stopping.”

So you should have stopped according to this.

I highly doubt you will get a ticket from a School bus — personally have never heard of such a thing in PA. In the case a prosecution attempt is made here they probably would just go after the other driver’s who blatantly ignored the school bus.

"Seems that their priority is revenue generation & anything they cannot avoid involvement in due to media coverage and pressure. Having worked on a lot of missing persons cases, it is very common for the police to completely shrug it off. It is costly to dedicate a lot of resources to a missing persons case, and while that shouldn’t matter, it seems to be a silent factor. The police usually only involve themselves heavily if 1, the dept assigns someone who is a stand up officer that actually cares (sadly uncommon, but I’ve seen some exceptional detectives do their job) or 2, the family is relentless and involves media which forces their hand. So, if anyone reading this finds themselves in a position where they have a missing loved one, only to be shrugged off by local PD (majority experience), forget them for the time being and pressure media - the more locals and loved ones pressuring media, the more likely they’ll cover and a ripple effect will occur.

"So for you to say that I don’t think you’ve ever seen or held a pellet gun. If you had, you’d know that when you hold them there’s only very slight differences between that and a firearm. These slight differences are sometimes imperceptible when being held, so one especially cant tell the difference when someone else is holding it. So there’s literally no way to know the difference. 

As to how deadly it is makes little difference. How many people die from being beat with a frying pan a year? Does that mean a frying pan has less potential to be deadly? How many people die from a bomb every year? Does that mean a bomb has less potential to be deadly?",t2_8y73l,IAMABobby,0,1648826018.0,0,t1_i2zqg85,i2zqg85,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_ttd717,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/ttd717/christian_halls_parents_sue_state_police_da_in/,"Christian Hall’s parents sue state police, DA in teen’s Route 33 killing",/r/Pennsylvania/comments/ttd717/christian_halls_parents_sue_state_police_da_in/i2zqg85/,2,r/Pennsylvania,0,2
