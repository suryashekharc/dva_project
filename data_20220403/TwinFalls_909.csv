"> I'm also interested in how broadly accessible social media and internet connection has neutralized the speech patterns of younger generations

Linguists are usually hesitant to say that mass media has neutralized accents. But, I think with the prevalence of social media now, there's now way that it has zero influence. It's hard to say at this point because we don't yet have adults who have grown up with social media from birth. I think mass/social media certainly does play a role in the spread (and subsequent rejection) of slang words though. 

> How would you say being Mormon has notably influenced your speech patterns?

My parents are converts and I didn't grow up in Utah, so I'm not quite as entrenched in the culture as others. But, I know lots of Utahns and see them every week in church, so some things have rubbed off. The clearest case to me is basically every Mormon says *apricot* as APE-ricot instead of APP-ricot. There's some regional stuff too, but most areas in the West say APP—except Mormons who say APE. The reason is there's a very popular children's song we all sing in church called ""Popcorn Popping on the Apricot Tree"" and everyone says it APE 100% of the time in that song. Since *apricot* isn't exactly common otherwise and we sing that song as early as 3 years old, it makes sense why that would stick.",t2_16yhq8wj,Dialectologist,0,1648745946.0,0,t1_i2vb24y,i2vb24y,False,Dialectologist,t3_ts8c95,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinFalls/comments/ts8c95/idaho_accent_survey/,Idaho Accent survey,/r/TwinFalls/comments/ts8c95/idaho_accent_survey/i2vb24y/,1,r/TwinFalls,0,1

In kind of a similar type of influence that being a third culture kid has on neutralizing an accent and broadening a global vocabulary, I'm also interested in how broadly accessible social media and internet connection has neutralized the speech patterns of younger generations. It's not like you only know the words and pronunciations from people closest to you anymore. Interesting stuff! I see why you're drawn to it.

How would you say being Mormon has notably influenced your speech patterns? I'm learning a lot about Mormon culture since moving here to Idaho.

Yeah, and those dialect surveys are crazy. They do a pretty good job at pegging me as a Missourian, but I have influences from Utah just by nature of being Mormon, which it also caught.

"It could definitely be worth exploring. I had a remote job for some time before covid, and I can imagine that they're not for everyone but can definitely be a great fit for others. It was amazing being able to work from anywhere I wanted and have some flexibility you wouldn't likely find in a more traditional job. I was working as a copywriter, which was great because I could get a creative job done on my own terms and still take care of my family. Bad because I also managed a few of the company's social media accounts and that job felt like it was never over and definitely bled into my personal life. I really imagine that the nature of the work would make the biggest difference, and sometimes your realistic needs just dictate a certain type of work experience if you're even lucky enough to get and keep a job to begin with!

Builders will most always cut you a deal on the lot if they own it since you are building through them! Just get yourself a good agent that’s willing to work for your best interest and even if you don’t go through an agent all it takes is asking if they’d be willing to work on the price of the lot since you’ll be building with them.

We are in CBH homes and while they are I think more limited with home choices & plans, there is an option for inside design styles and typically they come with a “credit” for them to install grass, sprinklers, fence or go towards closing costs.

"Indian springs has many hiking trails and a couple places to shoot near the trail paths. Just spend a bit to see where people go to hike\offroad to avoid them and you can find a spot that people shoot by the spent rounds on the ground. Usually it's all flat dirt and facing a hill. Everywhere else is sage brush, you'll see what I mean if you decide to go there. 

Personally I'd say plan a hiking trip so you can get a good look at the area cause it's awesome, then you'll probably just hear people shooting (maybe not cause it's cold ATM) and then you'll know the spots 

If you live in twin, go to Kimberly then go past ridley's and go straight(South? Google map it) til you hit the dirt road. It's about 10 mins from Kimberly I think.

"The Glenns Ferry Opera House is shipping in two comedians from Salt Lake on February 25th at 7:30. If you want dinner and a show it starts a 6.  The food is good, I can vouch for it.  Basically this is a group of people who are losing money trying to keep this beautiful building alive.  Book an hour in a private hot spring at the Banbury beforehand, take the scenic route through Thousand Springs, make a day of it.  Hop on the highway afterwards and you'll be home in 50 minutes.

There used to be a great little open mic at the Crescent in Nampa.  Really supportive place that let you give your tight five a try if you were trying to get started.  Covid killed it but maybe it will return one day.  The Crescent is a hidden gem, it's situated atop the springs that caused the railroad to make a stop there in the first place, a location that used to be called ""Sweetwater Springs"".  The beer is made from that springwater rather than from the city water.  Best bar in town since Monkey Shines got rid of the live monkeys.

I realize that is 150 miles away, but given that even Boise has very little in the way of standup, looking for it in Twin is a tall order.  If you find anything you should post about it, but it might be up to you.

"Black person who grew up in Twin Falls here (since 2007):

To answer this question seriously, there is a Black community in Twin Falls (as there is basically anywhere), and from my experience it is primarily refugees or immigrants from Africa: Congolese, Rwandans, Sudanese (including Eritreans who grew up in Sudan), and Ethiopians. Depending on where you live you may encounter them more or less: the Canyon Ridge side of Twin/West tends to have a lot more Black people than the TFHS side/East (which is where I used to live, and also where I went to school). That's the result of a number of factors, i.e. class and being more recent residents. There are apartment complexes on that side of town that actually have a relatively high proportion of Black people - again, primarily refugees. Another place is WinCo, where a lot of Black people and African refugees tend to shop compared to some other places (again, from my experience). There are also quite a few Black adoptees, primarily from Haiti as far as I know.

It is worth noting, however, that a lot of the Black refugees who come to Twin leave, and the same goes for non-refugee Black people who grew up in Twin, especially when they hit college age. Racism is really bad in Twin, frankly (and it was only after moving to Arizona, which isn't even that diverse or liberal, that I realized how bad Twin could be in that regard) and I think it motivates a lot of people of color to move out. In some schools out here, being a Black kid can actually be really isolating. I was consistently the only Black kid in my classes and my TFHS graduating class only had about 5 Black kids (including me). My younger sister's graduating class had about the same number.",t2_eb2qjhwc,uru_silko,0,1641007398.0,0,t1_hqrk6sc,hqrk6sc,True,katanez,t3_rt30qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinFalls/comments/rt30qq/do_black_people_exist_in_twin_falls_lmao/,Do black people exist in twin falls lmao,/r/TwinFalls/comments/rt30qq/do_black_people_exist_in_twin_falls_lmao/hqrk6sc/,17,r/TwinFalls,0,17

In modern times they aren't just using total moisture and snowpack measurements for yearly drought comparisons, they are also using groundwater depths. With these huge CAFOs using literally billions of gallons yearly in the Magic Valley the groundwater depths shrink almost yearly. This is why they scream drought when there is none on the surface.

"[Balanced Rock is pretty cool](https://visitsouthidaho.com/content/uploads/2016/04/balanced-rock-southern-idaho.jpg) and free

[Black Magic Canyon is unbelievable](https://www.google.com/search?q=black+magic+canyon+idaho&client=firefox-b-1-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi34v-T9NH0AhUCITQIHT8VCsAQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&biw=1120&bih=529&dpr=1.71) and free

You can only get into Black Magic during the cold weather, so you're lucky.

Blue Heart Springs are amazing but you have to stick your goggled face into ice cold water to see them.  You'd have to rent a canoe and hope you didn't get wet.

As mentioned, Shoshone Falls ($5), Evel Knievel ramp (free), Box Canyon (Free), Hagerman hot springs ($25 for the private spa), Craters of the Moon ($20, first class attraction), City of Rocks (free, cool rocks plus Emigrant history), if you go to Rock Creek Park bring a frisbee.

[Dead Horse Cave](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/idaho/tea-pot-and-dead-horse-caves) is pretty cool, it's free and has been kitted out as an Oddfellows meeting hall.  You could ride your bike around down in there.

Also, the Ice caves North of Shoshone (pronounced show-shown) are interesting.

I have been noticing that when doing some google street viewing looks like there has been a lot of recent developments. As for the market being inflated and competitive I'm pretty used to that being from Cape Cod and in browsing local assessors databases they seem to be lagging behind on the valuations which is a good thing as far as tax burden goes. And yeah having a nice view and access to nature trails and stuff makes a huge difference to quality of life in my opinion.

"One tricky thing is that some of the newer neighborhoods don't have recent Google street view images, so you can get a pretty good feel of a neighborhood overall and its proximity to the canyon and views, but you can only get so clear of a view on certain streets. Still worth exploring houses on Redfin/Zillow and getting a feel for the current housing market and how close you can afford to get to the canyon. The market is pretty dang inflated, but we've noticed it has gotten ever so slightly less crazy. One funny thing about the housing market here is that some photographer is making bank doing drone shots of a lot of the houses on the MLS listings, so that definitely helps you get a clearer idea of where the place is and what view you'll get to enjoy. We found a place in the north west area of Twin that has a great view from the backyard and we'll be able to walk the Canyon Rim Trail very easily from our neighborhood. It makes a difference to us! 

When we began searching for homes in October, we realized that being closer to the canyon was what helped make it feel like Twin really was a special place to be and we sought out some of the things that differentiated this small city from Anywhere, USA. You'll really enjoy spending time here! Lots of charm, beautiful views and a whole city full of people who seem to love doing things outdoors, with plenty of amenities that make it very easy and comfortable to live here.",t2_9a154nnq,okaymaeby,0,1637722860.0,0,t1_hluqti7,hluqti7,True,ToneChomsky,t3_r08be4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinFalls/comments/r08be4/neighborhoods_with_the_best_views/,Neighborhoods with the best views.,/r/TwinFalls/comments/r08be4/neighborhoods_with_the_best_views/hluqti7/,3,r/TwinFalls,0,3

"*DISCLAIMER* This is simply a dialogue based on available information and not intended to be adversarial.

I’m in a union and in the twin falls area. Also, latest numbers from September 2021 Idaho unemployment sits at 2.9%. So unless there was this mass correction in the job market population from august to September, these numbers are incorrect. Which seems rather likely given the disparate %. 

At the peak of COVID we had 3,000 Idahoans’ collecting unemployment. Interestingly enough though and maybe related to the numbers you cited, it was reported by the GOP central committee that 73,000 members (4.4%) of the workforce “up and disappeared”, for lack of a better term. Essentially The state can’t account for where or what happened to these individuals although there is speculation that they moved, opened businesses or succeeded in the stock market using stimulus checks. 

https://lmi.idaho.gov/

Additionally, as claimed by another commenter, the fatal percentage of covid cases is roughly 1%. This doesn’t even take into account people dying WITH covid as opposed to dying FROM covid. However, this is neither here nor there in the argument as you can see from Idaho’s covid statistics where there has been 285,003 “confirmed and probable” cases and 3413 deaths with only 2857 of those confirmed. These numbers reported by Idaho are inline with national rates regardless of masked or unmasked political policy at 1.1%.

Something else to consider here when you quantify the death rate is that not all who have covid even know they have the virus or even get tested due to minor symptoms. Because there is no way to record the number of unreported cases the truth death rate is actually lower with some epidemiologists estimating figures .2% lower.

Quiting doesn't mean they're staying unemployed. If that were the case you'd see unemployment go up too. 2.9% unemployment is really really low. People are finding better jobs with better pay.

You are so scared you signed your name? Twin is great and so is the outlying areas. I came from a liberal cesspool of elitist passive aggressive assholes. People were shooting up in my front yard while living out of derelict rv's with shit bag and piss bottles stacked up outside. The police did nothing and violent criminals were arrested and released within a day to comment another attack or assault. The local and state governments are corrupt and my old county doesn't even check to see if the mail in ballots were folded and mailed during their audit process. They gave government ids to illegals and signed them up to vote. Graffiti and garbage were everywhere. Antifa and their black block did more terrorizing and killing of people of color than the local police. All parks and green spaces around my city had drug filled encampment and people were attacked or killed looking for their stolen items. My kids school had to do needle pick up before kids arrived. They would find at least 30+ everyday. Wake up if you think Twin is bad. You are a fool.

"Been in this area or surrounding my whole life. 

Generic info:

1. Be prepared for winter diving (driving on snow and ice)
2. Twin Falls is largely agricultural so there isn't much of a nightlife.
3. Extremely close to kayaking, fishing, golfing, boating, camping, hiking, etc. 
4. If you enjoy recreational vehicles, plenty of space and places for that. 
5. Socializing and making friends - most of my friends are the ones I work with or I grew up with, sorry not much help here. 
6. Depending on where you are, you can get fast internet. Sparklight/CenturyLink will be the providers you need to look at. 

Someone else commented that Twin Falls and the surrounding towns are having problems with housing. Those that have lived here their whole lives are being priced out of the market.

"Hey so I moved over here from Richland/Tri-cities 10 years ago and just a few things to keep in mind.
It's small, not much shopping. Our biggest box retailers are WalMart, Target and Kohls.

It's beautiful. There's tons of stuff to do if you like hiking and exploring but not much else.

Our resources, like the library etc, are pretty outdated. 

There's no bus system. If you find yourself without a car for whatever reason like yours is in the shop, get ready to get a rental.

Traffic jams last less than five minutes and you can drive from one end of town to the other in 15 minutes.

Because it's a smaller town it's easier to find the bad part of town so it's not like making a trip to downtown to see the homeless and drug addicts, they live down the street instead of on the pier. We are way down on the list for drug problems, we rank at #48 out of #51 (they count DC separate)

It gets cold a little bit colder, about 10 degrees cooler, and there's a lot more snow.
