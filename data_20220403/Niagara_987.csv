"Great. That's what we need. Citizens voting on which traffic elements they want. Why not just design it by committee so it can be a complete cluster fuck?

This shit shouldn't be up to citizens who knew sweet fuck all about any of this.

Vision Zero is not about traffic or walkable cities or pedestrian corridors or active transportation. It is about the idea that even a single traffic-related death is utterly unacceptable for any reason, at any time, under any circumstances. 

Which is why it recommends 30km/h on any road where a pedestrian or cyclist might be hit. Because they figure a person can survive a 30 km/h hit from a car. So that means literally every road in STC (except for QEW/406) should be 30 km/h. Higher speeds are possible where the main risks are vehicle-vehicle head-on collisions. Even higher speeds would be possible on divided highways.

Which is utterly asinine because there are incredible stretches of road in this city where the lack of sidewalks **forces** pedestrians onto the road. 

So now that we have slowed down traffic by 20%, are we readjusting transit schedules? Are we changing the timing of traffic lights? Of course not. Those aren't feel good, virtue signaling, nor revenue generating.

You want to cut traffic fatalities? How about you actually investigate the circumstances behind the *actual* traffic deaths/major injuries. Separate pedestrians/bicycles from traffic. Then lets talk about lowering speed limits. You want to improve driver behavior? Improve the standard of driver education and licensing. The vast majority of drivers would fail European driver tests.

>“This is a resident-driven program, so they vote to put in the temporary measure and then we go back and we re-survey them to see if they want to keep it, to make it permanent or to have it removed,” Applebee said.

"You're obviously a bit off the deep end and I'm not going to feed this discussion on a dead post anymore, so I'll respond with my final thoughts and then you can have your space to respond. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't have at least 1-2 of the co-morbidities that went along with covid. Very few people are perfectly healthy. Did those co-morbidities make severe infection and death from covid more statistically likely? Yes. Should they have died from a disease that we have the tools to prevent the spread of? Nope. 

As for ""main stream propaganda"", you don't seem to realize that you're the one consuming the propaganda of conspiracy theorists and bad actors. The reason your theories about scientists being censored, etcetera, are so exciting is because our brains are wired to like exciting information. It's exciting to feel like we have an ""in"" on the truth. The real science of masks, vaccination, physical distancing reducing the possible spread of covid is pretty simple and boring.

As for research, I do *plenty* of my own research. From ""main stream propaganda"", as well as the stuff you subscribe to. I then use all of that information, assess the biases of the sources, assess my own biases, and then come to a conclusion. I'd recommend checking out mediabiasfactcheck.com as one source for checking the biases of news organizations. It's far from perfect, but it's a good jumping off point. 

Lastly, if my wearing a mask and getting vaccinated makes you feel compelled to attack me, I think you need to reassess your idea of ""who gives a shit"" about what other people do. If I shouldn't care about this guy painting symbols directly associated with mass genocide on his truck, then you shouldn't care that I chose to post it here. I sincerely urge you to do some research from reputable sources on how we as humans are vulnerable conspiracy and false information, and then reflect on the content that you see online, on TV, etc.",t2_55r8ekuo,niagirl,0,1647829588.0,0,t1_i1heef3,i1heef3,False,niagirl,t3_t82kf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/t82kf8/starbucks_in_welland_swastika_hammer_and_sickle/,"Starbucks in Welland.

"Hey, I know you’re trying to be helpful, and I appreciate the places you suggested (thank you!) but giving unsolicited advice about an individual reactive dog doesn’t really help me and our stressful situation. 
I want to clarify, my dog is a three-time adoption fail. He is already in training. And trust me when I say we’ve tried all the harnesses that apparently solve this problem (they often don’t and in this case didn’t). This is behaviour he likely picked up a few owners ago and working with him requires a lot of patience. Sometimes that’s really difficult and I like to take him on decompression walks when I can - ones where we don’t have to work on training as much and he can just relax because he’s not around his triggers. 
This morning he had a really stressful walk, so frankly I posted here hoping for judgement-free answers for places that I could use for his afternoon walk.
Like I said, I appreciate the suggestions for places to walk, and I’ll definitely check them out, but assuming I’m not working with my dog (and an expensive trainer) to fix this is just another thing among the many things that make having a reactive dog so difficult.",t2_8t91evwb,Whatexists_,1,1647643552.0,0,t1_i17piu1,i17piu1,False,Whatexists_,t3_th7yg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/th7yg5/my_dog_is_onleash_reactive_so_walking_him_can_be/,"My dog is on-leash reactive, so walking him can be pretty stressful sometimes.

"First of all I'd suggest sourcing a good trainer to help you teach proper leash etiquette. Sometimes just changing to a head halter or a chest halter will significantly change the dog's behavior. Otherwise you just have to train away the bad behavior and often it's both owner and animal that need the training.

The friendship trail is an amazing place I regularly bike it and run it all over from Port Colborne to Fort Erie. The Niagara Parkway trails especially up and around Lewiston bridge are great, and tend to be quieter outside of busy weekends. If you want to avoid crowds on weekends go south of Chippewa and work your way down from there.

"I will tell you, as someone who has worked at a dispensary, that they 100% cannot give you information about cannabis products and their relation to cancer treatment. It’s a Health Canada thing. So, unfortunately, you have to do a lot of reading yourself, or befriend a staff and talk to them outside of work about it. 

RSO is different from typical thc oil that you’d find at a dispensary - most common ones found at dispensaries are the redecan one, medipharm, and solei (in my experience). I read below that grand cannabis in thorold has RSO, so I would check with them first and see if you can grab it easily. Otherwise, OCS would be your next best bet for regulated** RSO. You could also try to find a place online to ship to you, but grey-market cannabis is not regulated, so it’s a buy at your own risk situation. I don’t want to insinuate it’s bad, but if you’re more comfortable getting it with the provincial sticker and seal, it won’t exactly be the place you would want to look. Some people get squirmy about stuff like that, so I just want to make sure you know before you order it from wherever.

Edit: you may want to look at r/CanadianCannabisLPs , r/OCS , or r/trees and ask there. I know a lot of budtenders and just people who have a wealth of cannabis knowledge hang out there. You may find someone who has used RSO.

"Someone correct me if im wrong but RSO is made using solvents like isopropyl alcohol or grain alcohol. You use the solvent to disolve the THC and separate it from the plant matter, then let the solvent evaporate away and you're left with RSO.

Most legal concentrates at the dispensary are solventless products that are made a totally different way, this is because making any kind of concentrates with solvents is dangerous (possible kaboom) and the final product can be dangerous if there is any solvent leftover in the concentrate.

"[Although people who take kratom believe in its value, researchers who have studied kratom think its side effects and safety problems more than offset any potential benefits.

About half of these exposures resulted in serious negative outcomes such as seizures and high blood pressure.

"Ok i'll break down the areas and give you some tips.
Starting south Fort Erie is viable as it's on the highway and town is small, only issue is there are very few ""middle ground"" choices and slum lords have a stranglehold on cheap housing.
Ridgeway is also a choice but more expensive in general.
Stevensville is even smaller than Fort Erie, and very rural.
Chippewa might have a very reasonable rental, closest town to Niagara Falls.
Niagara Falls will require about as much legwork as Welland to find a good deal.
Port Colborne will have the cheapest rent, but unless you need your methadone, there's nicer to live.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"I've been wondering the same thing as I would like to have a friend from Canada pick me up after walking across the bridge.

Canada makes this difficult.

I don't think you can enter the duty free lot from the Canadian side.

There's metered parking spaces on clifton hill which is easily walkable from the border entrance, I think it might be best to have the friend walk across, then have the friend call you once they are across then wait in a specific location, then you can drive to the location to pick them up once they call. If you sit in a metered spot even for a couple minutes with you in the car at the wheel I don't know how bad they are about ticketing for just rolling up to one of those spots for a few min.

If you are worried about not finding a spot have the friend in a place where a car can pull up quickly and get them. Make sure the friend knows what the car looks like.

If you were picking up a friend on the US side and the friend was walking from the Canada side to the USA side its so much easier, because there's a ton of places to just pull up and pick up someone for free.",t2_6r5hf,SaraAB87,0,1646689676.0,0,t1_hzramlg,hzramlg,True,iamsosillylol,t3_t8zrkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/t8zrkp/help_picking_someone_up_at_rainbow_bridge_canada/,HELP.

"Definitely, I went just over five years ago so want to preface by saying things may be different for those who have went more recently 

First the space is jam packed. 25+ dogs of all different sizes together in the same room. The spacing is very minimal, so expect to get super close to the dogs in your group.

Moving to the actual training, there wasn't much structure. A bunch of miscellaneous drills (sitting, laying down, how to properly walk, stay, etc) that all dogs are doing at once - so there's not really any specific feedback being provided by the instructor to you

Now that may be most training schools, but my issue was how corrections were made. He strongly recommend prong collars and corrections were made by popping the collar (to be balanced treats were brought by owners and encouraged to be used, but anytime multiple corrections were needed the prong collar was the preferred choice). A few other individuals there mentioned he had a background in training police dogs, so that's the best way I can describe it. The training wasn't to help teach your best friend, but more akin to training a police style pet.

The damage took a while to undo. My friendly puppy suddenly became super protective of us and developed issues playing with other dogs - none of which existed before Dave's school.

When we called to discuss with Dave, we were told our dog needed specialized 1v1 classes with him to break this - at a much higher cost. I won't even get into how patronizing he was 

We moved to Toronto shortly after and found someone who specialized in training through positive reinforcement, and it was night and day

"Hey /r/niagara!

I come to this subreddit with one of my projects that I have been working on - my 3D SketchUp model of the future skyline of Canadian Niagara Falls in Google Earth. This model contains all various proposed buildings near the Falls, including some older, stale, proposals that were made in the early 2000s that never ended up materializing, but weren't built as something else.

It contains 21 towers, including the major new ones that were proposed over the last few years. I would unfortunately consider it unlikely that many of these will be built in the near future, considering that many are hotels that would be directly competing with each other for market viability, but I like to be optimistic and paint a vision of what could be someday.

I work on lot of other skylines across Canada and have many in the works.

"I'm going to write some tinfoil hat business, but there's more connections between Niagara politics and the provincial conservatives than coincidence alone might allow:

1: LaFleche did a great job covering the CAO story.  This was a scamzilla to get a friendly CAO installed to allow Caslin et al to skim off the region.

2: As Pelham Mayor, Dave Augustyn sniffed this out and started trying to expose it.  This made our local Conservaitve types turn on Dave and invent the ""Unreported Debt"" business in Pelham

2(A): Pelham's been cleared 4-5 times on this story, and after 4 years, Mayor Junkin hasn't managed to ""find"" the missing 17 million he accused the town of hiding

3: Dave doubled down and ran for Regional Chair to shine more light on what he was seeing:

4: Doug Ford himself then came to Pelham to announce that the Chair position would no longer be elected, at the filing deadline, shutting Dave out.

5. Since they got caught anyway, all the major players from Caslin's crew parachute into Brampton to work for Patrick Brown.

"Not wise to bring a razor to a gun fight apparently.

As /u/BrandyBeaner pointed out the timing relative to WW1 is interesting too. For those who aren't too familiar with the WW1 timeline, Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated by Serbian nationalists on June 28th, Austro-Hungarian empire spent the next month planning and justifying through diplomatic manipulation a war with Serbia, and by July 29th had started bombarding Belgrade with artillery. In the meantime every country in Europe had been trying to discourage anybody from attacking anybody by throwing around various ultimatums that ""if you attack so-and-so I'll attack you!"".

At the point of this article, armed conflict was still limited to Serbia and the whole chain of events that brought all of Europe in was just starting, with Russia coming immediately to Serbia's defense, which triggered Germany to come to Austro-Hungary's defense against Russia on 1st August.

At the time this article was written (August 2) not much of what was happening on the ground was publicly known, but what we know *now* is that France was obligated to defend Russia against Germany, and was already mobilizing to do so, but Germany was a few steps ahead and was already moving preemptively on France. They sent troops into Luxembourg and demanded free passage from Belgium. On August 3 Germany declared war against France.

The rest is cribbed directly from Britannica:

>In the night of August 3–4 German forces invaded Belgium. Thereupon, Great Britain, which had no concern with Serbia and no express obligation to fight either for Russia or for France but was expressly committed to defend Belgium, on August 4 declared war against Germany.

>Austria-Hungary declared war against Russia on August 5; Serbia against Germany on August 6; Montenegro against Austria-Hungary on August 7 and against Germany on August 12; France and Great Britain against Austria-Hungary on August 10 and on August 12, respectively; Japan against Germany on August 23; Austria-Hungary against Japan on August 25 and against Belgium on August 28.",t2_ajjk,cecilkorik,0,1644460988.0,0,t1_hwbcw28,hwbcw28,True,grimsbylibraryonline,t3_sosfq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/sosfq4/a_murder_took_place_in_grimsby_beach_in_1914/,A Murder Took Place In Grimsby Beach In 1914,/r/niagara/comments/sosfq4/a_murder_took_place_in_grimsby_beach_in_1914/hwbcw28/,4,r/niagara,0,4

"There is no business that I am aware of that will procure and bring the goods over for yourself.  While it seems like a great idea for a business, certain goods can come with a ""hidden"" cost as well depending on the product and not just a matter of paying the HST/PST, since a tariff or duty could be applied.

Re:  PO Box, yes you can get one, depending on the setup they may charge a monthly/annual fee or a fee per package, worth checking into the options if you are looking to ship a large amount.  For example if you order three different cables and one of them is on back order, the vendor will probably ship what they have in inventory and then ship the back ordered one when it comes in, this will result in two charges by the PO Box company.

Re:  Crossing the border.  Do not take advice from Reddit and read up on the requirements as these have changed a few times.  During pre-Covid times, it was easy, have a passport or Nexus, go across answer the questions by the US Border Team, do what you need, pay the bridge toll to come back to Canada, talk to the Canadian Border Team, answer their questions, and go.  Depending on the value of the goods, you might be sent inside for payment purposes for any taxes, duties, or tariffs that are being applied.  This is the tricky bit.  Generally declaring under $50 results in a quick THANK YOU AND GO, and over $50 is a hit and miss on if they will ask you to pay the duty/tax on a product(s).  Under COVID, you need to fill in the Arrive-Can app prior to getting to the Canadian border.  There is no guarantee that they will let you go with ease and if your Arrive-Can information is questionable or incorrectly filled out, they can hit you with a quarantine order as well.",t2_4mypp7mg,The-Raccoon-Is-Here,0,1643151132.0,0,t1_hu7tlcq,hu7tlcq,True,redditnewbie6910,t3_sbv1fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/niagara/comments/sbv1fw/question_for_shippingdelivery_from_us/,question for shipping/delivery from US,/r/niagara/comments/sbv1fw/question_for_shippingdelivery_from_us/hu7tlcq/,1,r/niagara,0,1

After a week the fee would increase to account for storage costs. There were flat fee monthly plans if you were going to use them a lot.
