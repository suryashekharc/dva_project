"Too much staging. Pretty distracting from the actual center of attention being the pills. 

Like the last one for example. What does the plant have to do with it, the pinecone, the crystal. 

If you are going to add an object, add a mushroom or a couple. But right now super distracting. The first one is the best. 

Don’t show the logo for the jar company. Use a smaller jar so it looks fuller, no one likes a half empty jar. (A regular amount people might buy at once, like a medicine bottle sized amount, or two different sizes)

"There’s a logging road that spits you out onto the North shore of the lake a little ways East of the Ash River hydro station I think.  It has a primitive boat launch (I wouldn’t drag a nice boat out there though).  If you launch elsewhere, that is a nice safe spot to come ashore in a boat.  Sandy gravel and no big rocks.  

I’ve kayaked from there to the west end of the lake to do the Della Falls hike, and honestly the shore camping isn’t great.  There are a bunch of cabins on the north shore and and some floating cabins on the south shore.  I would t want to roll up on someone’s cabin.  

There is a dock at the west end of the lake at the Della trailhead, but. Be cautious boating over there Because there are tons of old trees/snags in the water at that end (near Drinkwater Creek).

"Surf shops to the beach tend to be driving only but I've seen some shops that do lessons and provide rides and boards (not sure if that is still happening with COVID). We took a boat of a sedan to Tofino and they gave us roof straps so we could take boards to Florencia and back.

In terms of the Island and nature, Strathcona Park is obviously gorgeous and huge but it is still snowy-ish this time of year so I'd bring cramp-ons just in case. Also day-tripping to Newcastle Island from Nanaimo is a fun walk around the Island. East Sooke Park is also gorgeous and there are some petroglyphs there that are pretty neat.

"You can rent soft roof racks from most of the surf shops.  They work fine for the relatively short distances (a handful of kms) that you will be travelling.  So any rental vehicle will be fine.  I’ve seen 4 huge soft-top boards strapped to the top of a tiny little hatchback. 

Regarding breaks, there really aren’t any secret breaks close to Tofino, unless you want to hire a boat (like Groundswell Adventures for example).  In town, you have North and South Chestermans and Cox Bay… as you head south you hit Long Beach then Wickanninish.  Chestermans and Cox will be busy on the good peaks. Long beach and Wick are huge expansive beaches, so if you feel like going for a bit of a walk, you can almost always find a peak to yourself.  With that said, at Long Beach, just north and just south of Lovekin Rock are the most reliable peaks.  At Wick, the most reliable is in front of the most northerly parking lots.  

Have a chat with the rental company when you pick up your gear and they will give some good advice about which breaks are working the best with the swell/wind at the time.  Feel free to shoot me a DM at the time-of and I’ll give you my best guess about which beaches will be best.  Have fun.

Edit: hiking down to Radar Beach is a nice getaway from the bustle.  Close enough to town, but enough of a hike to stay pretty quiet. Kayaking or water taxi to Meares Island is nice too, you can do an easy boardwalk hike through some nice old growth (mostly red cedar) or if you’re up for it, hike up Lone Cone for an epic view of Esowitsa Peninsula.",t2_htnww,30ftandayear,0,1648506390.0,0,t1_i2hsnbt,i2hsnbt,True,nisu_srk,t3_tqjsx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/comments/tqjsx2/how_far_are_the_tofino_rental_shops_from_the_beach/,How far are the tofino rental shops from the beach?,/r/VancouverIsland/comments/tqjsx2/how_far_are_the_tofino_rental_shops_from_the_beach/i2hsnbt/,5,r/VancouverIsland,0,5

">You are silly.

Ah, interesting. I think the same thing about you. Nice to see you be the first to break out the ad hominem attacks though. It's a sure fire sign of someone not believing their own argument.

>All the pointless things you list are totally irrelevant. They are all Illeagle and therefor not in the same category as the legal things that have public limitations. Such as nakedness or wearing a mask. 

The relevance is that there isn't a single square inch in Canada where you are free to do whatever you'd like. Public and private spaces are both governed by a set of democratically decided rules and regulations. We elect people to set those rules and regulations, and use elections to pressure change where we see fit.

A bylaw of wearing masks in times of pandemic is no different.

If you can't spell therefore, you have no business using the word.

Literally everything else you said was word salad, and lacked any kind of logic. ""Ownership is not a priveledge, it is a right."" Ugh, what? What do people own that can't be instantly be taken by the government for a variety of reasons? Imminent domain, seizure of goods procured through the proceeds of crime . . . Hell, not paying taxes are all instruments used to instantly take property from Canadians. Your grasp on our basic laws is tenuous, at best.

> As for it not being up to a vote. I got nothing to say to you about that except for I don't support authoritarian ideals. Thankfully thats not how it works so you are free to believe in authoritarian ideals. If your belief were the way it is. You might not be.

There are thousands, and thousands of bylaws and regulations that have never been put up for a vote. That's not the system of government that Canada is based on. You have dreamt up a version of governance that doesn't exist in Canada, or the rest of the world for that matter.

The idea that every minute regulation should be decided by the mob is a NIGHTMARISH idea. Imagine, every bylaw campaigned by special interest groups. It would be governance by the deepest pockets. 

The most UNPOPULAR questions of personal rights should never be left up to the populace mob to decide. That's a recipe for receding into the social dark ages.

"You are silly. All the pointless things you list are totally irrelevant. They are all Illeagle and therefor not in the same category as the legal things that have public limitations. Such as nakedness or wearing a mask. 

Ownership is not a privilege it is a right. Private ownership is gaurenteed to anyone who qualifies for said ownership. The guidelines differ depending on a large variety of things. But the most basic one everyone has with no conditions is bodily autonomy. You own yourself no one else can take that away. The only limits on this are overall laws that apply to everyone. Because you dont have the right to violate anyone elses right or property. This all makes sense. It isnt confusing. Your comparisons define your lack of understanding. Your strawman claim about me being blissfully unaware of other limitations is rediculous and just as silly. You're failing to see the difference in one restriction vs another.

"“Wherever there is fishing, there is bycatch—the incidental capture of non-target species such as dolphins, marine turtles and seabirds. Thousands of miles of nets and lines are set in the world's oceans each day. Modern fishing gear, often undetectable by sight and extremely strong, is very efficient at catching the desired fish species—as well as anything else in its path. A staggering amount of marine life—including turtles, dolphins and juvenile fish—is hauled up with the catch, and then discarded overboard dead or dying.” -WWF

"Alright. Then having a business license is a privilege. Using a transit vehicle is a privilege. Owning property is a privilege, considering you sign up to follow the local bylaws.

A private business, on private property, still has to adhere to a boatload of licensing terms, and obligations, no matter how private of a business it proclaims to be.

There are also, limitations and obligations laid on private land -- they are called laws. You still can't sacrifice humans to pagan gods on private property. You still can't rape people, or keep child brides on private property, or operate a distillery, or build a house without a permit . . . this list is literally endless.

You seem to have an issue with one particular limitation; but are blissfully unaware of tens of thousands of agreed upon limitations of private land.

"Driving is not a right its a privilege. In order to get a driver's license you've got to obey the laws in place. By getting a drivers license I agreed to those terms willingly. 

Anything governemnt owned or public is within the governments ability to enforce a ""must wear clothes"" mandate. However in a private business or privately owned property you do not in fact have to wear clothes if the owner says you don't and the government can't force you or the property owner to enforce the ""you must wear clothes mandate""  which is the way it should be with masks and vaccines. A choice. 

Hopefully you can see the error in your examples. I appreciate the attempt at reasoning though. I am not against masks or vaccines. Just the lack of choice as I am with any additional mandate that infringes on private owners.

RV camping is hard to find spots anywhere in western Canada these days. 

The ferry has always been busy. Yes it has gotten busier lately but book a reservation, or take off peak hour boats. I’ve traveled to the main land several times in the past year no issues no waits. 

The ferry costs around $90 each way for 2 people and a car. Expensive yes but it’s not ten times the cost it was even 2 decades ago.

"The Island in May is pretty warm in the day (15-21 C) and cooler at night (usually single digits).  Your chance of dipping below freezing are zero unless you're at elevation.  Expect to spend at least one night and day in the rain, likely more, but you'll also likely get sun as well.  If you camp on the coast the fog will be entertaining.   I like to bring 2 tarps, one for over my tent to augment the rain fly, and another to set up as a roof so I'm not stuck inside all day if it's torrential.  There will be lots of loose  wood around and you'll get excited for a fire, but it'll all be damp or wet and keeping the fire going will require constant supervision until the bed of coals gets going.  Stay warm using wool or synthetic as much as possible in case it gets wet.  The mud here is real.  Be ready.   


Something that hasn't yet been mentioned is that in the spring the bears will be active, but there's not much food for them yet, so they'll be a little more bold about looking for stuff.  Be diligent about bear safety like cooking food well away from where you sleep, hanging your food at night and knowing how to not look like something they want to eat should you have an encounter.   The bears on the island are pretty chill, you likely either won't see them or you'll just see the back end of one taking off so don't let this discourage you.   It's worth noting that there are a good amount of cougars and wolves here too, so read up on how to handle them too.    


As for camping spots, most people I know avoid the campgrounds because they're expensive, often booked months in advance, and full of RV's.  So most of us just find old logging roads and pull over near rivers to camp.  It's hard to describe in terms of a tip. But if you can get your hands on the Backroads Mapbook, you can have a lot of fun exploring.    


You will not have phone reception for large chunks driving between Port Alberni and Tofino, and again driving between Tofino and Port Renfrew if you take the gravel roads.  For that matter you won't have reception for long periods between Renfrew and Sooke.   I have a Satellite Communicator for emergencies.  It might be overkill for a 9 day visit.    


If you can make the time to check out Youbou (pronounced You-bow for .... reasons), do it.  You have a very high chance of seeing Elk near or in the town, or at the campsite on the north point of Lake Cowichan.  The road from Port Alberni to Bamfield is brutal right now due to the winter and logging trucks, so be ready to vibrate the whole way and get the extra insurance if you're using a rental vehicle.   The ""highway"" from Port Alberni to Tofino is currently under construction and you can get caught for up to an hour waiting to be flagged through as the workers blast rock.  When you see signs for construction ahead, take the time to stop and use the washroom if you have any need at all just to be safe.

"The Island is fairly warm in May. Warning, it can rain any time of year, but May is usually warm. There are all sorts of private and public campgrounds on the Island. Be aware there is a blasting job on the road (Hwy 4) to Tofino. Expect delays. They have a FB page. I would stay in the national park (camping) in Tofino or one of the luxury accommodations on the beach. Or try Ucluelet. For temperatures, you are better off looking at historical weather information online. The gear you bring depends on what you want to do. Whale watching in Victoria means good waterproof gear, or you might want to climb the Golden Hinde. The north end of the Island has fantastic views from mountains to sea side.

"I’d go for Comox Valley (Comox/Courtenay/Cumberland) area rather than either of your choices.

Nanaimo is only an hour from here, CR is 40 minutes. The valley has Costco and Superstore and all basic amenities. Nanaimo has the rest and can be accessed year round. 

Only thing is if you aren’t used to mountains, it can feel dark. Mountains block the late sunlight, something I never thought of before moving here.

"I was born in Campbell and lived there until I went off to university. Campbell river is definitely growing and there are some drug problems but you wouldn’t notice it unless you walked around a certain part of downtown. I go back there to visit family sometimes. I grew up near the hospital (near downtown) but recently moved to stories beach (willow point area)

Willow point (newer suburban area) is a good place for a family to live. The sea wall and ocean views run right though Campbell so doesn’t matter where you live, you get to have an accessible view. Also there are tons of families that live there if your are looking for that kind of community. It’s slightly less sketchy too, but a 15 min drive away from downtown. Newer houses and young professionals. 

Beaver lodge lands is a giant park that is also right in the middle of Campbell river and it runs from the older part of town to the start of willow point. It’s about 8km of beautiful forest with plenty of trails. Good place to take kids on a fairly flat, maintained trail. 

I lived in the older part growing up and loved that I could drive into the middle of nature within 20 mins. The lake (mcIvor) is also a 15 min drive away from downtown if you’re want to swim and the river is also a nice place to swim which runs right though Campbellton. Owning a boat is a game changer because you can explore the beauty so easily - also fishing is super popular in the summer. Hiking is awesome too. There is hiking of all levels from 10 mins away - 1.5 hours away. Strathcona provincial park is 45 mins away and has amazing hikes that are well marked. 

One thing I will say is that the high-schools don’t offer IB or AP curriculum to students. This is just due to lack of teachers and students wanting to go to post secondary. I’m sure the education is better now, but when I graduated (2018) we didn’t even have a proper/constant chemistry teacher which made me feel super behind my other peers at UBC. The trade off though is that I grew up without much school stress at all (no homework, never studied, still got straight A’s) - played every sport, went to the beach during lunchtime and went skiing on weekends. Nanaimo has more schools and more options when it comes to your kids education so you might want to keep that in mind. Campbell rivers high schools didn’t offer me much support when it came to post secondary education. Applications and counselling was all on me and only the self motivated kids in my grade went to uni. The school offers a lot of support for Trades though. This will all improve, however as the town grows. 

Also to answer your questions - no weather difference really. They’re both coastal. Campbell river is extremely wet tho and the highway can get nasty if you’re trying to drive to Nanaimo to catch a ferry. 

Things to do with kids during the day: I used to baby sit 3 boys and they loved going to the beach. There is a sandy beach called Saratoga which is great in the summer, but also the rocky beaches at low tide are bursting with life that kids love to explore. The lake is also a fun option if you’re into that. What’s been popular in recent years is “Velocity” which is basically a driving range at a golf course but you get served food and drinks while you watch your friends play. It has comfy seating and there is sensors in the range which tell you how far you’ve driven the ball. This would be a relaxing option for parents because you can order some nachos and beer while watching your kids compete and have fun. Also enjoyed kayaking, skiing on mount Washington and mount Cain, fly fishing, ocean fishing, hiking and biking growing up there. 

Let me know if you have any questions I’ll be happy to answer.",t2_9a5dx7pz,Clean_Comedian3227,0,1648048960.0,0,t1_i1sztgi,i1sztgi,True,stressedmom_1289,t3_tkuq3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/comments/tkuq3d/thinking_about_moving_to_nanaimo_or_campbell/,Thinking about moving to Nanaimo or Campbell River from Northern AB.,/r/VancouverIsland/comments/tkuq3d/thinking_about_moving_to_nanaimo_or_campbell/i1sztgi/,20,r/VancouverIsland,0,20

"Nanaimo and CR are my two least favourite places on the island! Haha! But if I had to pick, I'd say Nanaimo because it's bigger and obviously more centralized, with more options for schools, neighborhoods, etc. As mentioned above, it has a university and obviously more amenities.

My next point I mention because over the years I've seen so many families posting about a lack of housing or high costs after they've already made the decision to move. Please take into account housing and your budget. Buying a house here is incredibly expensive. Renting a house is not only expensive, but difficult.

"The road never killed anyone. They unfortunately died as a result of a very bad decision to drive a bus on that road after dark. It is a resource road, that is the original agreement between the citizens of Bamfield and the private operation that built and uses that road for resource development. The BC government decided to get involved and started paying for road maintenance, so vehicles like tour buses could also use it (at their own risk). Last time I tried driving down that road, I turned around at the gravel pit after a couple of kilometers on gravel. There were so many potholes and large over-sized logging trucks were coming around corners ""on my side of the road"". This is typical of resource roads in BC.

"As already posted above, those kinds of cafes are no longer, since legalizing. But there are so many amazing places to go and just get baked and enjoy nature, all over the island! I am not sure where on the island you are going?
My first recommendation is Newcastle Island. (Saysutshun) it is a small island off Nanaimo that can be reached via a 10 minute ferry ride from downtown Nanaimo. The entire island is a nature park, there are no roads, only trails. It takes a couple of hours to walk around the entire island. There are so many lovely spots to just sit and be. The view from any spot is incredible. There is a small store/café open in the summer months, but I would take food and whatever you need for the day with you. You can even take a bike on the ferry if that is your jam. I always take my bike but it’s not for everyone.
I am a 48 year old stoner that grew up on the island, so I have a massive encyclopedia of places to enjoy being stoned in all over the island. Let me know if you would like some more options.

"I heard about there being a serial killer somewhere in the valley by some locals before coming out to the island so I may have already had the jitters going into this.

So I (35M) was just recently up island near Courtney/Comox and had a weird experience where a man pulled out behind my truck when I slowly drove by on a backroad. I was looking for a trail I saw on satellite images. He would have easily been able to spot my out-of-province plates I think. 

Anyways I found the spot but the guy literally followed me right to it. I started down the trail head and got a strange sensation and felt a little paranoid about that guy so I turned around and headed back to my truck. I grabbed my survival knife and a water bottle. I pretended I had come back for a water bottle, and headed back down the trail. I looked back and the man, who I could make out now to be maybe mid forties and thin, had started to follow me down the trail as well. I guess he could just be coming to the same trail as me, I thought, and I'm being a little paranoid about it. So I figured I would test if he's just heading down the same trail as me or there is something else I'm missing here.

I decided to veer off onto a convenient side trail right away and feigned some excitement about a big ass tree and pulled out my phone and snapped some pictures. I looked through the trees and could see the man that had followed me stopped when I looked at him. He turned around and went back to his car (grey dodge challenger) and drove away.

I have no idea what that whole scenario was and if I was ever in real danger, but fuck that story or the Van Island serial killer getting in my head either made me paranoid or maybe it saved my life!

Turns out it’s great and really suits my wife who is a life long city slicker and would not have adapted well to the mentality of living out in the country. She’s very much in the city mindset of, “I can go to the store any time I need something.” Which is not something you want to do living out in the hinterland unless you have a lot of money for wasting gas which we do not.
