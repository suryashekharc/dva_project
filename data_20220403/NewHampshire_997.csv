"Up near Claremont-ish is the Newbury/New London/Sunapee area. If you like hiking, the Andrew Brook Trail to Lake Solitude, Sunset Hill Trail across from The Fells. The Fells also has great walking trails and gardens. Clark’s lookout. Those were listed from most difficult to least, by the way! All offer beautiful views. Stop by Spring Ledge Farm or Brothers Burgers afterwards for good energy and good food. Or Sanctuary Dairy Farm for ice cream and cute animals. 

If you go a little farther, it gets better. In the White River Junction/ Leb area you’ll find VINS, Montshire Museum, King Arthur Baking, Queechee Gorge, and in Leb by the L.L Bean there’s a sweet new skate park. 

All that being said, there is truly no shortage of fun as you go farther north into the Whites. If mountain biking is a thing for you, def check out Green Woodlands, too!

"I'm fascinated by mill towns, of which Claremont is one.  And it's also interesting how some mill towns (Newmarket, Dover as examples) have survived with busy downtowns, and others (Rochester, Claremont, and many others) have struggled.  


You might consider taking your daughter to eat the Common Man in Claremont, which is in a beautiful old mill building.  There's a small outdoor seating area where the river can be seen.  And/or, around the block on North Street, is an area with some signage describing the place.  


Have a conversation with your daughter about all the manufacturing that took place in these towns.  Show her that before electricity was available, these factories would set up anywhere there was a river where the water dropped, to get energy to power the mill.  Imagine all the workers pouring out of those buildings at quitting time.  There's a (currently closed) Tumble Inn Diner around the corner that surely served many of those workers in its day.  


Would she be interested in covered bridges?  The Cornish-Windsor bridge is just up the road and easy to take a ride over.  (PS, on the Vermont side of that bridge, are Routes 5 and 91. 91 was built between 1958 and 1965, diverting traffic that used to pass through the small towns on 5.  You might drive up and down 5 for a while (great views of the Connecticut River), and as you pass through the town centers, discuss what those town centers must have been like not so long ago when lots of people drove through on their way somewhere else.)",t2_yyefo,Maldonian,0,1649006534.0,0,t1_i38uem8,i38uem8,True,joostadood526,t3_tvc9we,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/tvc9we/sweet_home_new_england/,Sweet home New England,/r/newhampshire/comments/tvc9we/sweet_home_new_england/i38uem8/,1,r/newhampshire,0,1

">Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, who also voted against the  
bill in 2020, issued a statement on Friday announcing his opposition to the  
bill because his amendment did not receive a  
floor vote.  
""I support decriminalizing marijuana,"" said Pappas. ""I am  
disappointed that the full House was not given a chance to support the  
bipartisan amendment I submitted to address these issues, including explicitly  
preventing violent felons, organized crime leadership, or anyone who has been  
found guilty of trafficking fentanyl from being let out of prison or having  
their federal records expunged.""

"> You can 3D print a functioning machine gun or a rocket launcher with a $300 printer.

I take it that you haven't seen automatic sears for M16/AR15 style rifles made from metal coat hangers that have been around for nearly 50 years.

You are absolutely unhinged from reality if you think that being able to print 3D firearms on a 3D printer is any different from being able to make a firearm or automatic sear with a mill and a lathe. As you said, making machine guns and destructive devices is already illegal and the only folks who are doing this are breaking established law. There is no loophole that gets around this, it is absolutely illegal to make destructive devices and automatic weapons, regardless of the method of manufacture without government approval.

"You can 3D print a functioning machine gun or a rocket launcher with a $300 printer. You can 3D print a part that turns a Glock into a submachine gun. You gun nuts are out of your fucking minds if you think the government is gonna let some ancap cryptocurrency dorks bring back the days of Al Capone’s Chicago Outfit shooting cops with tommy guns.

There’s a video of Texas cops getting shot at by a gangster with a machine gun made with 3D printed parts after knocking on their door with a  warrant. I hate cops, don’t really give a fuck about guns one way or another, and it made me sick to my stomach. They’re gonna come down on this shit like crack cocaine in the 1980s. Straight to jail for life, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars, and even right wingers are gonna support it after they see a few videos of cops with wives and kids taking their last breaths at the hands of MS-13. This isn’t new gun control legislation. It’s literally the oldest gun control legislation on the books: the NFA of 1934. So what if it needs a little modernization for the 21st century?

"I was there in November for a convention...

The hotel parking lot had quite a few... Interestingly decorated cars and campers in it, including some trucks that would land on r/funny as they were covered in... Q propoganda, for lack of a better term.

In the hotel there were little coffee clatches of people - walking by them you'd hear nonsensical tidbits of conversation.

Some of them were selling Trump Kennedy 2024 shirts in the lobby. Most of them were polite in the hotel but some of them were quite rude.

Walking around outside (a few blocks away from where JFK was assassinated) they'd be wandering around in groups wearing their shirts and MAGA hats. When I was there there were no huge crowds at Dealy plaza, but some of the cult were among those around.

One guy in the hotel would wear a tinfoil hat. This was in the hotel. I didn't interact with him but the others there basically seemed like mentally ill people.

"Interference, fraud, etc, it’s all the same stuff that corrupts the vote.

Either we can all agree the voting system sucks and work out methods to fix it, or we can continue to let it deteriorate and rage when “our guy” loses under questionable circumstances.

We’ll have a fair voting system when all Americans can agree on basic fundamentals:

 - Only citizens should be allowed to vote in federal elections

- Eligibility must to vote must be verified by a secure and reliable mean (if by ID, then all IDs must be free and easy to obtain by federal or state entities).

- Equal voting access across the board for all eligible voters (if that be a mail system, it must be secure and not susceptible to mass fraud).

- Optimally, we use paper ballots like Canada, which generally seems to have a solid record in terms of election legitimacy, and is the least likely to be hacked or influenced to any serious degree.

- Extra bit: Ranked choice voting must be investigated more as a viable option for third party selection

These are just 5 basic fundamental things. If Americans can’t come together on these issues, you can kiss the idea of ever having a government for the People goodbye. Elections will only become more questionable by each side and nothing effective will actually be done cause one side will be the useful idiot defending the broken system when their guy wins the election.

"Sorry - I wasn't trying to be argumentative, we just often seem to forget others don't have access to the resources we often take for granted.

I don't think it's widely known that vouchers are available, but it does also impose another trip on the voter.

There is no perfect solution, but the very few cases of voter fraud were perpetrated by the losing party in the last election - so I don't  think that restricting voting is the answer.

Mail-in ballots, many collection areas, expanded voting times - why does every vote need to be in one day - why not just count them all that day?

You don't have to drive to vote, there are many free services. The problem is that they are for that day. Those free rides (and the federally required time off) are not for things like registering to vote or obtaining an ID.
 
Personally, I think we should be pushing the availability and access to voting to the point where the secretary of state becomes concerned that there might be a chance of fraud. Then, we would have found a better balance.

Those are not mutually exclusive. Kind people trying to do their best? I absolutely agree. Sensible? I would not say the *vast* majority.

Not enough data to know if this polling is super accurate, but roughly [15% of Americans believe](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/study-finds-nearly-one-five-americans-believe-qanon-conspiracy-theories-n1268722) that the U.S. government, media and financial worlds are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking operation. When you have a country with ~55% voter turnout, this aggressive block is significant. That doesn't mean these people, amongst the majority of humanity, are not kind.

I think having the reaction to be outraged, post about this, etc actually serves to further spread the propaganda.

I sometimes wonder if the best reaction to stuff like this is none at all. Pay it no mind. Don’t post about it, don’t talk about it, etc. instead of feeling the need to warn others, we have faith that most will have the same reaction as us.

There aren’t enough of the vulnerable people who will fall victim to this to propagate these ideas so widely. The reasons these movements reach so many people is that they are propagated by folks like us, either poking fun at the movement or raising alarm… either way, it further propagates the shit, allowing it to reach more people.

"""Much of the propagandist writing of our time amounts to plain forgery. Material facts are suppressed, dates altered, quotations removed from their context and doctored so as to change their meaning. Events which it is felt ought not to have happened are left unmentioned and ultimately denied. [...] Indifference to objective truth is encouraged by the sealing-off of one part of the world from another, which makes it harder and harder to discover what is actually happening. There can often be a genuine doubt about the most enormous events. [...] The calamities that are constantly being reported -- battles, massacres, famines, revolutions -- tend to inspire in the average person a feeling of unreality. One has no way of verifying the facts, one is not even fully certain that they have happened, and one is always presented with totally different interpretations from different sources. [...] Probably the truth is discoverable, but the facts will be so dishonestly set forth in almost any newspaper that the ordinary reader can be forgiven either for swallowing lies or failing to form an opinion. The general uncertainty as to what is really happening makes it easier to cling to lunatic beliefs. Since nothing is ever quite proved or disproved, the most unmistakable fact can be impudently denied.""- Orwell",t2_3oz12376,Centurion_Zen,0,1648862066.0,0,t1_i321qjw,i321qjw,True,bruceallenwp,t3_tu1m33,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/tu1m33/anyone_else_get_this_in_the_mail_portsmouth/,Anyone else get this in the mail? 🤦‍♂️ Portsmouth return address.,/r/newhampshire/comments/tu1m33/anyone_else_get_this_in_the_mail_portsmouth/i321qjw/,2,r/newhampshire,0,2

"CW: mention of s*x offenses

Here's [the bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617/text) in case you didn't read the OP link, the [amendment he proposed](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/PAPPNH_065_xml220329095055573.pdf) and also a link to [his full statement](https://pappas.house.gov/media/press-releases/pappas-statement-more-act-vote)

Basic breakdown of his amendment and my opinions on each part (disclaimer: IANAL, I just google things):

TL;DR: Representative Chris Pappas really hates people with prior convictions and doesn't care that A) absolving non-violent weed offenses does not absolve other crimes and B) we already have a definition that would work fine for non-violent crime (i.e. crimes except those defined by [this US code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/16))

The bulk of his amendment, exceptions section D 1-11 (to be inserted under SEC. 10. of the bill, starts with changing EXCEPTION. to EXCEPTIONS.)

1. The passed bill already excludes people who ""[were] an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive"" under [3B1.1](https://guidelines.ussc.gov/gl/%C2%A73B1.1)(a); his amendment would also include section b and c, basically adding anyone who had more than bottom level involvement in any organized crime involving marijuana. Not necessary, IMO. I wouldn't even include exception (a) for being organizer or leader - this is specifically an adjustment to marijuana crimes, not a separate charge; why continue to incarcerate marijuana-only dealing leaders and organizers that could become marijuana business owners?

2. Excludes people involved in specific violent crimes as part of their marijuana crime, I think; also excludes people with a previous marijuana offense adjusted as such. Seems to be an attempt to further define non-violent Federal marijuana offense. Presumably they would also be convicted of other crimes, but even if not, excluding these adjusted sentences would clearly go against the intent of only expunging non-violent Federal marijuana offenses as mentioned a few times in the original bill. The part excluding people with a previous offense (read: a sentence already served) seems excessive.

3. Adjustment exception for possession of a dangerous weapon while committing the marijuana crime. Another attempt to further define non-violent. Pretty lame exclusion, IMO, for reasons I hopefully don't have to explain in this subreddit.

4. Another adjustment exception, this time for ""if the defendant used violence, made a credible threat to use violence, or directed the use of violence"". Again, lame, would already be excluded as a violent crime.

5. Hey look another exception for violence, this time for apparently unrelated crimes: ""[person] at sentencing was also sentenced for conviction of a serious violent felony"" or people with a previous such conviction. They still have the violent crime conviction. As I said in 2. above, the previous conviction part seems especially excessive.

6. Exception for people who were also convicted of ""an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another"" at sentencing, or people with a previous offense of that type. Why does this dude have such a hate boner for people with previous convictions.

7. Exception for people also convicted of a sex offense at time of sentencing or prior sex offense. Sex offense in this case is defined under section 5 [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/34/20911) (Amie Zyla expansion of sex offense definition). They're still convicted of the sex offense (or were convicted, and are thus on ye olde registry).

8. Oh fuck it's the boogeyman: would exclude anyone also convicted for a Fentanyl crime at time of sentencing or previous offense. Very topical.

9. Exclusion for people ""also sentenced for conviction of an offense involving causing death or serious bodily injury in connection with the trafficking of or a conspiracy involving a narcotic drug (or prior offense)"" at time of marijuana sentencing or for a prior offense. Maybe an attempt to further define non-violent, maybe just another way to punish people convicted of other crimes.

10. Exclusion for people with a prior or concurrent conviction for distribution or manufacturing (read: being a Drug House™) in or near 1000ft of schools, colleges, playgrounds, public housing, or within 100ft of youth centers, public swimming pools, and video arcades. Lmao this would exclude like half of marijuana offenders. I hope I don't need to include my thoughts on prior convictions again. I could maybe see an exception for distribution to kids under 18 or something but that restriction could also just be an amendment to [the 21+ tobacco restriction](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/retail-sales-tobacco-products/tobacco-21) (also idk what the science is re: use by people w/ developing brains but last I recall it's not a good idea).

11. Prior or concurrent offense for employment, hire, or use of people under 18 by an 18+ person for drug stuff or assisting or avoiding apprehension for drug stuff, or offenses involving 18+ people receiving drugs from under 18 people (except immediate family). Just another example of extra punishment for an entirely different crime. I also have no idea why there's a law specifically against 18+ people receiving drugs from under 18 people. Seriously. Why?

Finally, we get an attempt to provide an official definition of non-violent Federal marijuana offense, thus making half of the above exceptions unnecessary and/or a blatant attempt to uphold punishment of incarcerated people:
>The term ""non-violent"" means, with respect to a Federal cannabis offense, that the offense did not involve the possession of a dangerous weapon or the threat, use, or direction of violence.

As I mentioned above, explicitly including possession of a dangerous weapon as a violent crime is a load of bull hockey. Otherwise this is a useless definition: we already have a definition for ""violent crime"" (or ""crimes of violence"") here in [18 U.S. Code § 16](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/16); a normal person or even a weirdo like a lawyer or judge would conclude that ""non-violent"" crime would be, you know, crimes that aren't ""crimes of violence"".

NB: the dangerous weapon (as opposed to a deadly weapon) clauses are extra egregious because, as quoted from [this site](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/dangerous_weapon):
>Dangerous weapons can be much broader [than deadly weapons], including objects that are not lethal in nature. In [McLaughlin v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/476/16/#tab-opinion-1956595), the Supreme Court found a dangerous weapon as used in a federal statute even included weapons that inherently were not dangerous, like a wooden gun, but created fear of danger.",t2_6vapf,Zapafaz,0,1648860447.0,0,t1_i31yjpf,i31yjpf,True,ArbitraryOrder,t3_ttwy5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/ttwy5f/representative_chris_pappas_votes_against_bill_to/,Representative Chris Pappas votes against Bill to Decriminalize Marijuana Federally,/r/newhampshire/comments/ttwy5f/representative_chris_pappas_votes_against_bill_to/i31yjpf/,3,r/newhampshire,1,3

"I think registration just shouldn't cost significant amounts of money. Every single firearm should be registered and should be able to lead back, clearly and easily, to who currently owns it, has owned it, and who manufactured (or printed) it. Want to print 30 guns? Pay registration fee for 30 guns, get them serialized (all privately owned guns absolutely should be). Just make the registration not cost so much. There's no good reason why registering a gun should cost so much. Car registration already costs too much. $20 per gun seems totally reasonable to me. $100 is insane. It absolutely does not cost the government $100 worth of man-hours and resources to process that sort of paperwork. It's a tax and everyone knows it. It shouldn't be taxed.

"I am acutely aware (and have been for 40 years)  that the hard core religionists and militant fundamentalists will not ""change their minds"" and leave religion. 

 I'm writing so that that many who are not aware of the serious threat these fanatics pose is exposed


As long as religious fanatics are passing laws that persecute women, LGTB+ humans, and push for a militant theocracy  I will never calm down

As long as states like Texas, Florida, and Idaho are passing laws that end up killing women by not allowing abortions for fetal anomalies and ectopic pregnancies,* I will never ""calm down""*

As long as trans and gay humans are persecuted and are comitting suicide I will never calm down

These fanatics are a deadly threat to the remnants of our secular Republic.  

Action and activism is required, and calming down will never help in the effort to stop the Dominionists in their quest for a viciously militant version of Handmaid's Tale

"> When’s the last time a democrat has made an honest effort to ban any kind of firearm? 

It was in reply to this statement, and 3D printed firearms are a kind of firearm, so in this case it is very much in line with the question presented.

With that said, you are legally allowed to make firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968 - provided that you are not making them with the intent of sale or transfer. They do not need to be serialized and you do not need to be registered to make them, unless local legislature dictates otherwise. Currently, 3D printed firearms have no difference from any other firearm under federal law.

Following that point: should 3D printed firearms be banned solely because they are ""easier to make"" or have a lower price barrier to manufacture? I think not. Doing so only prices out those who are less affluent from having the ability to manufacture weapons for personal use. Registration also poses a similar burden, which, as you can assume, I am opposed to.",t2_7oarn,itsmckenney,0,1648854775.0,0,t1_i31n66i,i31n66i,False,ArbitraryOrder,t3_ttwy5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/newhampshire/comments/ttwy5f/representative_chris_pappas_votes_against_bill_to/,Representative Chris Pappas votes against Bill to Decriminalize Marijuana Federally,/r/newhampshire/comments/ttwy5f/representative_chris_pappas_votes_against_bill_to/i31n66i/,6,r/newhampshire,0,6

"Let's pretend a bit. 

Let's say you're a 20 year old white guy, living in Concord. 

You live with your mother, who's a single parent, and your younger brother. 

You had to start working full-time at 15 years old, because your mother got sick and can't work. 

You're in low-income housing, and you've gotta work two jobs to make ends meet. 

You're working 60 hours a week, and since you don't have a car, you have to rely on public transportation to get to and from work. 

There's staffing shortages, so it'd be almost impossible to get a day off at one of your jobs, let alone both. You don't get PTO, so it's not like you could afford to lose the hours anyway. 

How are you gonna make time to get down to the DMV? And for what, to get a non-drivers ID? What does that get you, the right to vote? You know you're just one person, that your vote doesn't matter.  

Getting your driver's license would probably make things a lot easier, but you never learned how to drive, and you can't afford lessons. Even if you could, used cars are still ridiculously expensive, and gas is more than $4 a gallon. So even if you had a license you wouldn't be able to afford to drive. 

You haven't had a day off in months. You're exhausted. Every joint in your body hurts. 

Say you get a day off, by some miracle. You gonna spend that at the DMV? 

---

So, does this person not deserve the right to vote, just because they were dealt a shitty hand in life? Sure, this guy might have the $10 it costs to get a photo ID, but if he can't get down to the DMV, it doesn't matter. Our hypothetical guy is white, too, so it's not a race issue. 

People say that voter ID laws are racist because people of color are far more likely to lack photo ID than white people, since they're far more likely to be in poverty than white people.
