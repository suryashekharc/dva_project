We use both vets. Each are good vets. Eastside vet is appt only. But good if you can do a mon-fri sort of deal. Loyal family vet is open mon-sat with sat options reduced. For 24 hr emergencies I'd recommend [https://bluepearlvet.com/](https://bluepearlvet.com/) eastsidevet recommended them as they are aware that eastside is only mon-fri appt only. We use the tukwila location as they're 20 min from home. 

I would NOT recommend [https://www.newporthillsvet.com/](https://www.newporthillsvet.com/). They've been going down hill since 2016 when management/owners changed hands. We have ceased our business with them. I'm pulling the remainder meds we have through them. Hell this vet can't even get a simple food order correct and that's saying something. Wait times are horrid. Bed side manner varies from decent to bad. They almost killed our cat in a simple medical procedure that shouldn't of been difficult with proper training. We switched to eastside vet after newport almost killed our 3 year old kitten in a simple dental cleaning procedure. They did some unauthorized things to him and they should have consented with me before doing the decision. We've been happy with eastside vet ever since. I'm so mad at newport for mucking up simple food prescriptions that I'm yanking all my business with newport and will be asking eastside vet to write me new prescriptions. When we placed orders through newport online and in person they'd fail to do them correctly half the time. If we placed an order in 24 hrs before pick up at site they'd fail to do it and request us to come back next business day only to find out no one bothered to do it. They'd often loose the prescription and orders we placed 24 hrs before pick up and that's not a good sign for a vet. Their online pharmacy is just as bad and I'm yanking all my business with newporthills vet. Sad we've been loyal to them for 2 generations.

"> **In Sammamish, revolving door of city managers continues**

> *March 28, 2022 at 6:00 am | Updated March 28, 2022 at 9:07 am*

> Sammamish will soon lose its city manager, marking the third time in under four years the city is agreeing to pay the person exiting the position.

> The Sammamish City Council voted this month to enter into a separation agreement, effective March 31, with City Manager Dave Rudat, who was hired as interim manager in February 2020. As part of the agreement, he'll receive severance pay, six months' salary — his annual base salary is approximately $225,000, per his contract — and a letter acknowledging his accomplishments in Sammamish. Neither the separation agreement nor the letter has been released.

> Mayor Christie Malchow, Deputy Mayor Kali Clark and Councilmembers Amy Lam and Karen Howe voted to offer Rudat the separation agreement. Councilmembers Karen Moran and Kent Treen voted against it.

> ""The investigation and fallout has sidetracked the city from focusing on important issues such as growth, housing, and climate,"" Lam, whose term began in November 2021, said in an email. ""We need to regain the confidence of our residents. Integrity and ethical leadership matters.""

> In an interview last week, Rudat said he had enjoyed trying to help the City Council achieve its goals, calling city staff ""very professional and very likeable.""

> ""They really put forth a concerted effort to take care of the community, and they are on par with anybody I have worked with in any other community,"" he said. ""It's a beautiful place.""

> The reasons for the City Council's decision weren't made clear, though it follows an extensive, months-long investigation into Rudat. The full investigation's findings haven't been publicly released; the city denied a public-records request ""in anticipation of potential litigation.""

> In 2021, the City Council hired legal counsel and authorized an investigation into allegations that Rudat mishandled confidential city information and had the ""appearance of potential improper influence in the performance of your job duties,"" according to a note of potential discipline sent to Rudat and obtained through a public records request.

> In a 10-page summary of the report, Katherine Weber of the Inslee, Best, Doezie & Ryder law firm found that Rudat, on certain occasions, failed to effectively safeguard city communications that fell under attorney-client privilege. Those city communications, Weber wrote, were overheard by a family member of Rudat who disseminated the information.

> The investigator wrote that Rudat ""more likely"" didn't affirmatively disclose the information, but that it couldn't be ruled out, either. The investigator found there was insufficient evidence to suggest the family member had influence over the city manager, but had the potential to invite questions and concerns about fairness or nepotism.

> The City Council voted in November to potentially suspend Rudat without pay up to 30 days pending his rebuttal of the investigation, though he was never suspended. In his rebuttal, obtained through a public records request, Rudat denied all allegations and wrote that he had been left in the dark through much of the process.

> The Eastside city of about 67,000 has churned through three permanent, one interim and two acting city managers since 2018.

> In mid-2018, then-city manager Lyman Howard was paid $300,000 to separate from the city after three years in the role, according to the separation agreement obtained through a public records request. Glenn Akramoff was then hired as acting city manager before Larry Patterson took over as interim city manager.

> Rick Rudometkin was hired in May 2019, and after six months, the City Council voted to offer him a separation agreement. As part of his agreement, he received 12 months' pay and benefits. Chip Corder was named acting city manager and resigned in February 2020, writing in his resignation letter that he didn't believe his views of the roles and responsibilities of the City Council versus staff aligned with the City Council's.

> Rudat was appointed to the interim city manager position later that month. In a news release at the time, then-Mayor Moran said Rudat's appointment was a ""huge win for the residents of Sammamish."" The City Council voted to hire him as city manager four months later.

> ""I don't believe the city should be releasing city managers at the drop of a hat,"" Moran said in an interview last week. ""It's embarrassing. You work with people, you send them to a few classes. You don't just throw them away.""",t2_1ofwa5r7,igoinoneverycomment,0,1648616355.0,0,t1_i2ogde6,i2ogde6,True,igoinoneverycomment,t3_tryr8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastside/comments/tryr8d/in_sammamish_revolving_door_of_city_managers/,"In Sammamish, revolving door of city managers continues",/r/eastside/comments/tryr8d/in_sammamish_revolving_door_of_city_managers/i2ogde6/,8,r/eastside,0,8

"It's really weird to me that people are still replying to a comment I made 10 months ago in my local subreddit.  You guys don't even know what the first comment in the thread said.  Neither do I, because it was so long ago.  Maybe it put the rest of my comments in context.

When someone donates to street performers they are often doing it because they were entertained (in which case, aren't the donators still entertained even if they don't understand what they were being entertained by?  Lots of artists lipsync in concerts and people still manage to enjoy themselves.)   Otherwise, they are donating out of pity.  I can feel pity for people who are just sitting despondently on a sidewalk.  I can feel pity for people who are pretending to play a musical instrument.  I can feel pity for people who actually can play a musical instrument.  

Only being willing to donate to actual musicians is a mindset I can't understand - it would mean wanting to donate for reasons other than entertainment or pity.  What is the motivation here?  Hence my comment that the apparent motivation is widespread belief that the free market is disproportionately not compensating good musicians adequately. It's a ridiculous comment but it's the best motivation I can gather by people's indignant responses on this post.

"It's 100% about what you like to do, and what you like.

Downtown Bellevue - A super trendy, expensive, city experience. People say it's the best area for nightlife, but I've always found it completely dead after 8pm. If you want to live in a hi-rise it's the only option outside Seattle. Plenty of expensive bars, and places to eat.

Bellevue Crossroads - A little bit more chill, w/ plenty of nice places to hang out. If you like board games, MTG, and D&D then Mox, and Uncle's are popular hangouts. Lot's of good restaurants, or take-out places. Some of the apartment complexes are really crappy though (e.g. sandpiper).  Crossroads mall is pretty neat because it's not what I would consider a normal mall. Mostly lesser known shops, and the best food court I've ever been to.  Bellevue Brewing is pretty good, but there seems to be a distinct lack of good bars.  Mustard seed 2, and Damian's are the only 2 bars that come to mind, and I think Damian's is technically Redmond.

Redmond - While Redmond is becoming more and more commercially developed it's still got a lot of small town vibes.  It's great for nature walks, and the nightlife is much more concentrated than Kirkland, and Bellevue so it seems more lively.  Plenty of great restaurants, and probably the safest area to be in. Black Raven, and Post Doc are great breweries, plenty of bars from hi-end like Matt's, and Matador to dives like Palmer's.

Kirkland Downtown - Downtown Kirkland used to be the place to go on the eastside for 20 somethings, but it's dying out. Flatstick is a nice beer bar, and chainline brewing is good. They have top golf, and tons of waterfront events over the summer.  Wild Rover is closing so you know the area's nightlife is dying.

Woodinville - if you want something more rural or you want a ton of wineries, breweries, and/or distilleries then Woodinville is the place. Don't expect much nightlife, or city luxuries, but it's not a horrible place to be.

Downtown Bothell - is sort of a mix between everything. You got Zulu's for nerd stuff. A lot of places for beer if  you consider Kenmore's beer row close enough, and a few decent bars. Everything seems like it's trendy development, but it's not really as bad as it seems. There's still plenty of trails, and a popular frisbee golf course.

"I think it really depends on the individual. Personally, we rented a house in Bellevue (Lake Hills) when we first moved to the area.  Nice area.  Very clean and green, but we are early 30s/no kids and while we are definitely over the downtown living, the eastside felt a little too sleepy.  Personally, I am not the biggest fan of Downtown Bellevue, I think it feels a little sterile (downtown park is nice though!), also I think rent is pretty expensive downtown. We do have some friends who live in Totem Lake in Kirkland and they seem to like it there. 

In the end, we left the Eastside to  buy a house near Columbia City (Seattle) and we are pretty happy here.  It has a good balance of residential character with parks/greenspace but still  walkable to shops and restaurants.  There's good access to I-90 and I take the train to Belltown for work (15 min walk + 15 min train).

"Kirkland, Bothell, Bellevue, Woodinville are all good places to live on the north end. If you're commuting from south to north I'd suggest no further south than Renton. On a good day that would take up 1.5 hrs daily both directions. If you're in Bellevue you're already half way there and have more routes open to take. Kirkland is in the convergence zone for weather so you'll end up seeing more snow up that direction in the winter time. 

Start watching google maps for traffic patters so you can get an idea of what's what. it'll also help you familiarize your self with the roads a bit before coming over. 

Prices are about comparable from dc to here so you'll be use to high expenses. As long as you're earning $18/rh at full time you're doing well. If you're pulling in 38k-45k annually you'll be fine.

"An architect is trained to figure out efficient use of space as well as make things look good and draw up the necessary plans and documents for a permit.  I personally believe that using a good architect will *save* you money over not using one, because they can optimize the use of space, getting more utility out of less square footage.

Your architect will talk to you about budget and what you are trying to accomplish, and can steer you toward remodel plans that give you the finishes you want and the spaces you want while staying within the target budget.  They will also work with the builder throughout the construction project to make sure things are done as intended.  

For a remodel of a 1964 home I'd suggest looking at CTA Design Build who can do the architecture as well as the remodel.  I haven't worked with them myself, but Julie Campbell who cofounded the company is one of the most knowledgeable people about the history of Mid-Century architecture in the PNW.  Here's a gorgeous remodel they did of 1960s house: https://ctabuilds.com/project/kirkland-mid-century-modern/
One of the things I really like about CTA is their ability to work very well in a variety of styles, which you will see on their web site.  Also, because they do the building themselves they have a great handle on ""what dials to turn"" to get the features and finishes you want within your target budget.

Another local architect I really love who works with mid-century houses is Chesmore Buck  (I personally know Rick Chesmore, and he's a genuinely nice guy.)  They showcase their ""fancy"" projects on their web site, but they have also at least half a dozen remodels in Lake Hills, the mid-century neighborhood at the SE corner of Bellevue that was always Bellevue's lowest-income neighborhood.  Rick thinks about the environmental impact of the work they do, and is a strong believer of remodeling rather than rebuilding whenever possible.  Here's a stunning remodel of a mid-century house done by Chesmore Buck: http://chesmorebuck.com/projects/233614

I also have a soft spot for SHED Design of Seattle, who has also done some gorgeous remodels of mid-century homes in Seattle.  I discovered them through their [stunning remodel of a 1959 Madison Park Ranch House] (https://www.shedbuilt.com/portfolio/madison-park-ranch-house/) but they have also done some amazing remodels on the eastside including this Bridle Trails remodel: https://www.shedbuilt.com/portfolio/bridle-trails-remodel/  I casually know one of SHED's project managers, and I know that they're also very interested in considering environmental impact of their work.  They lean more towards ""showpiece"" architecture than the others I've mentioned (meaning it catches attention compared to surrounding buildings) so that may or may not be your style.

If SHED is out of your price range but you like theer style, you could also try Alex Hale, who used to work for SHED and was the lead on the Madison Park residence. 
https://www.alexhalearchitecture.com/

I have a 1957 house in Lake Hills, and when I'm ready for a remodel these are the 4 firms I'll be talking to before I make my final decision.


An architect will charge something in the range of 8-15% of the build/remodel cost.

"So there are remodeling companies that will include design and the actual remodeling service. This is the more expensive route because they will already have everything. They’ll have an electrician, a carpenter, a floor guy, a designer, etc etc. This option costs a lot more (I was quoted almost 100k for a very basic kitchen remodel), but is easier. 

The other option is you hire a designer (or an architect in some cases), depends on what you are doing. Some designers may have a contractor that they work with, some will just provide the design/plans and you bring it to your contractor. 

I guess a third option is doing your own design, but you’d have to know if a wall is load bearing and if electrical, plumbing runs through it. This is what we ended up doing, but we also did our own remodel and hired a structural engineer to verify that walls were not load bearing.

"OP clarified elsewhere this is for his mother and reverse mortgages are for owners aged 62 and older.

The reason I didn’t recommend a refi or HELOC in this situation is the requirement to make regular payments - which OP’s mother can’t do independently meaning any traditional loan package she gets would be cannibalizing itself. If she got a reverse mortgage, she is only on the hook for origination fees and things she already should be doing (ie. pay property taxes, homeowners insurance, general upkeep). The article you linked says “There's nothing inherently wrong with reverse mortgages, which allow seniors to stay in their homes while borrowing against a percentage of the equity.”

As he got older, I attempted to get a normal job, but I worked in tech and very few companies want to hire a tech person who’s been out of the loop for a while. If you haven’t been in that position, you can’t know how hard it is. 

I’m really lucky, I eventually just started freelancing again and then found some work that’s significantly below what I should be earning.

There was maybe 1 or 2 places within our price range on the market at any given point from all those places combined and 9/10 it was dilapidated or miniscule.  

We bought where we bought becuase we were able to get SO much more for the money, newer development, 1800+ square feet, yard etc.

As you suggested, I did the latter half of Silver Nugget to assess my skill level.  When I felt ready to attempt a full black trail, instead of the full Silver Nugget, I did Hogs Wild.  According to a random ski instructor I started chatting with, Hogs Wild is the easiest black.  It was a nice mix of slightly steeper incline with moderate moguls.  So for me, Hogs Wild was how I graduated from Blue to Black.

"Landlords do not get a free pass on rental income for taxes. That would be too good to be true. There are things you can do to deduct some of it like depreciation and business expenses and mortgage interest.

I didn’t mean paying the bills as in utility bills. I meant the mortgage, the maintenance, the property manager, etc. These are expensive and it’s hard to cover them without a tenant paying rent. During the pandemic some landlords had a tenant living there for free causing wear and tear, and not allowing them to find a paying tenant. Either everyone should get a free pass or no one should.

It’s unfortunate that your landlord sucks. I think I’m better than that, try not to increase rents if possible, and my rentals are well maintained but in return I need to have good tenants. Being able to select from candidates and make sure they don’t have a criminal history is important to me. Since I can’t do that in Seattle I’m now an exclusively east side landlord.

"Biggest problem with Duvall are the arterial connections, whereas NB has the biggest E-W one in the state. This is anecdotal between friends and my commutes from Duvall/NB to KSEA. Depending on commute time, traffic will build on you once you hit Issaquah, but still nothing like I-5 (405 going into Bellevue in AM and out of in PM can be ""special""). Honestly--plan routes/trips in Waze at the times you're expecting for the best idea.

I am NB, so sticking to what I know (North Bend) forward.

If you like the outdoors, we ARE the play area for MTB, gravel riding, hiking, etc. in this part of the state. That stated, it also becomes a love/hate with being inundated on the trails with visitors from the west during the summer months/nice weather. If you don't hike that much, probably not as big an issue.  Just take that into account. I'm sure locals in Moab have the same issues.

That said, if you don't handle rain very well (already), NB has a microclimate (s) that is hard to prepare for. We have rain...unlike just about anyone else on this side of the Sound. Sun in Seattle, Bellevue, Issaquah? Just wait until you head down the hill past Exit 27...wipers will come on more times than you can count. Sunny days...are glorious. But seriously don't underestimate how much cloud cover gets bottled up in the Snoqualmie Pass (and out into North Bend).

Schools-have two school age kids, but their mom is a teacher in Issaquah...so they go to Issaquah and we don't have personal knowledge of Snoqualmie Valley SD. As I understand it, not the top, but definitely no where near the bottom.

Crime-relative, but honestly very little depending on neighborhood. Aggravated/serious crime IS rare. Thefts at the Nike Outlet Store as thieves escape back onto I-90...oh yeah. Edit: trail head break ins are a thing all over-the same in our area although it sounds like Hwy 2 is worse). Keep your vehicle cleaned out, etc and ""hopefully"" you will be good if at the trail heads (Raging-MTB/Si, Lil Si, Mailbox, some of the close I-90 hiking THs are where we see this nastiness rear its head).",t2_mbc0cn,METT-,0,1646614892.0,0,t1_hzn9tob,hzn9tob,True,PartySuccotash5011,t3_t8b779,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastside/comments/t8b779/north_bend_vs_duvall_home_buying/,North Bend vs Duvall Home Buying,/r/eastside/comments/t8b779/north_bend_vs_duvall_home_buying/hzn9tob/,9,r/eastside,0,9

"When looking for housing years ago my wife and I checked a place in Duvall.

"Redmond is 2.5x the area of Evanston and has a smaller population. It should hardly be surprising that much of Redmond is a further walk from downtown when it's larger and less dense. But then again, how many parks like Marymoor or 60 Acres does Evanston have?

You're picking up SFH in particular, but there are tons of apartments and townhomes in DT Redmond that are highly walkable to everything you need and then some. There are some nicely walkable SFHs near Marymoor and also Redmond Ridge (which is its own island), but you're right generally most of them are further from downtown. It's just a matter of how city limits are drawn; to be the same distance from downtown Evanston, you'd be in Wilmette or Skokie instead.",t2_n8ktn,oren0,0,1645897656.0,0,t1_hyje9fa,hyje9fa,False,UnamiWhale,t3_sz82em,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastside/comments/sz82em/the_eastside_suburbs_are_kind_of_underwhelming/,The Eastside suburbs are kind of underwhelming?,/r/eastside/comments/sz82em/the_eastside_suburbs_are_kind_of_underwhelming/hyje9fa/,1,r/eastside,0,1
"I disagree.  It's not just downtowns. How walkable is Redmond downtown to where the SFHs in Redmond are?  Not at all.  In Evanston, the surrounding neighborhood to downtown is highly walkable all over.  There is several mile radius of tree-lined sidewalks you can take to push a stroller to every part of Evanston.   It's not just one concentration of chains, parking and condo developments surrounded by roads and highways.

Kirkland downtown is better in that regard.  But to say Redmond downtown blows away Evanston and Palo Alto, means you actually haven't spent anytime LIVING near those areas in Evanston and Palo Alto to appreciate the fundamental difference between those suburbs with Redmond.

"You are correct. Especially compared to the New York exurban areas, it's not delivering on the value. However the thing to remember is that those places are hundreds or thousands of miles away, so in many respects this is the only game in town. I'm very much in favor of more culture and cultivation being brought to this area, though I'm not sure exactly where to start. However I would suggest that the tech industry isn't going to be the avenue for that. Google and Redmond and now SpaceX being on the eastside has been more the cause rather than the solution to the current imbalance, in my opinion.

And highway noise? I mean, ok, sure, but c'mon that's not really the issue.

And also the park system here is much better than most suburbs I've been in before, though I can't speak to the Chicago area. But really, the parks are pretty good compared to most expensive suburbs I've been around.

Fundamentally, this is an area that is growing too fast in many respects. So the price of the area is ahead of the actual development. This is a sort of mutation in progress we are living in.

But the development is happening, like Bellevue (which is a bit misguided) or Totem Lake (also misguided, but slightly less so) and hopefully they'll figure it out in the next 10-20 years. Apparently 85th is going to see a lot of new building in the years ahead.

The area needs more arts / culture investment, badly. That's the main thing. The money is already here, the infrastructure is here, the clientele is here, the services are here, but the culture is not.

Great schools, community enclaves, and generally good parks/outdoors access it’s not a bad place to live - I could name some fantastic parks that aren’t close to a highway. Doubt the latest tech influx will change anything, this area has had a gradual stream of tech money coming in for three decades now. 

The big difference between here and Brookline/Palo Alto/Evanston is, outside of Bellevue, you can buy a house that is only half-insanity.

"In this crazy housing market (and I don't mean the 2021-2022 market; I mean the American market in general), price is only partially driven by factors like aesthetics and walkability. I've lived in suburbs across multiple states and on some level they're kind of all the same: subdivisions of single-family homes of various sizes, connected by streets that make no sense and are designed for driving (i.e. have no sidewalks or lighting), plus amenities that all assume that you are driving to them as well (i.e. giant parking lots and drive-thrus).

Really, it's more driven by location and the competition of the market. Seattle has the good-bad fortune of being populated by many techies, many of whom have moved from more expensive markets and therefore have money to drop on housing. Also, being a favorite of investors who have cash and can pay up front drives the competition and the overbidding for houses.

Being from a Sun Belt city, I too am kind of appalled when I see what some of these fairly ordinary (and often outdated) houses tend to go for in my Eastside suburb and its surrounding towns. Even some of the mini-mansions with all the nice marble and electric fireplaces would sell for half their price, if not less, in my hometown.
