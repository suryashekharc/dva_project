"This is my take. We live in a Democracy and local democracies at the town level are very representative of the local homeowners who pay property tax and support local businesses. 

If you want a weed shop in your town you have to convince your neighbors, they can go to the town boards/councils, speak their minds and elect officials to represent ""their"" interest. 

It's plain and simple. 

I don't want to take me kids to Ocean City and have pot smoke wafting through the streets. Because that is what I saw and smelled last summer and there is no weed shop or dispensaries in town. 

I'm no straight edge nerd, but their is a time and place for everything. 

And the myth that weed is harmless is just a myth. Long prolonged heavy use does have consequences as with anything else abused from alcohol, to energy drinks, to McDonald's.

"Pick up a honing steel - it's a rod with a handle on one end.  Some people call it a sharpening steel, but it does not really sharpen the knife.  A few passes on each side of the knife will restore the straightness of the blade edge.  I sharpen our knives maybe once a year but use the steel more frequently.  It will really make a difference.  
  
For sharpening, I was recommended by a chef, to pick up one of those little sharpening tools where you draw the knife through two V's - one coarse, one fine.  Steel it first, sharpen, steel it again.

"Wilderness Campsites:  
There are 77 family wilderness campsites at the eastern end of the reservoir. Each family site accommodates up to 6 people and are open April 1 to October 31.  
Each site is in a secluded clearing in the woods and contains a fire ring with grill. Drinking water is not always available so we encourage campers to bring in water. **The restrooms are primitive, and showers are not available. Drinking water, when available and pit toilets are within walking distance. The sites are only accessible by hiking or mountain biking three to six miles or boating across the reservoir. The trail leading to the campsites is very steep, rocky, and windy in some areas.** These sites are not recommended for very small children or the elderly. Campers boating to their campsites need to be aware of the wind warning system. This system is activated when winds reach a sustained speed of 25 mph. There are four strobe lights; one at each dam, one at the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife public boat launch, and one at the middle of the campgrounds. If any one of the four strobe lights turn on, boating is prohibited.

He thought he was so smart, but he got caught almost immediately. I wasn't surprised to hear how things ended for him. He clearly never learned anything from his mistakes.

Looking at those sketches, that could be him, I haven't seen him in many years but he had a big nose and beady little rat eyes.

"That's crazy that thread got so much traction, Brian was a friend of mine from Tabernacle, I talked to him about 5 mins before this happened in '89. I know people will say I'm biased, but Brian was not a bully, he was a smart-ass class clown type skater kid who never got into a fight in his life. The problem was he was a smart-ass to a guy who today would be considered on the ""Spectrum"" and needed mental health care before anyone knew what that was a thing. The other odd thing was that like a year after the Meth thing a body was found in the marshes of Atlantic City, that couldn't be identified, the reconstructed face looked like Phil, so much so my friends called to say they thought it might be him, but nothing came of it.

"> I don't engage on Facebook

Could’ve fooled me since you parrot every talking point there. 

>but I appreciate your generalization. 

It’s not difficult 

> Also it's quite telling that you mock someone doing research on their own and not blindly trusting another person or corporation to know what's good for you.

Doing your own research does not equal reading shit on the internet. Based on everything you’ve said, that appears to be the extent of it. 

> Are you ok with a business telling someone to leave because they don't like their ethnicity? Muh private business?

Irrelevant. That’s racism. Discrimination based on race is illegal. Not hiring someone for not getting a vaccine is not. I hope you’re a better nurse than a lawyer. 


> The majority of patients with covid in my hospital are vaxxed and boosted

Smart

>What happened to the winter of death for unvaxxed? 

You didn’t hear about all of the unvaccinated people who died of Covid? How far underground is your hospital?

> Didn't happen. 

It did. 

> Most covid deaths currently are people who have gotten at least one jab.

Not true. But even still, one jab isn’t enough. That’s why it was a two-jab deal. 

> I have personally seen an increase in weird and rare cancers since mass injection campaign. 

And you’ve written peer-reviewed papers on this? Or are their cancers not related? Can you prove they were related? 

>Notwithstanding the people who suffered or died because the hospitals were too preoccupied with covid to provide ""routine"" care. 

Because they were full of unvaccinated people who were shocked to learn it wasn’t a liberal conspiracy. Imagine that! 

> So many people were scared into not following up on care.

This is true. Unfortunately. 

>Also, not wanting to get an experiment injection doesn't make me suck at my job. 

Doesn’t make you good at it either, champ. 

>Your delusion about the inflated numbers (recalled PCR testing, couldn't tell covid from cols or flu) or when they quietly release ""of covid, vs with covid"" numbers, doesn't bear out in reality.

Back to Facebook talking points again. Wondered when we were gonna circle back to that. Oh right, you don’t engage Facebook. Fine. Social media talking points. There, better? 

>Everything I saw from the beginning of this has been people manipulated by fear. 

Not dying is a good motivator. 

> Some good people got caught up in, maybe you're one. Others took advantage of their new found moral high ground and became just like the nazis they were supposed to hate.

So now they hate Jews? I’m confused. Oh right, everyone you don’t agree with is a nazi. Got it. 

> All the mandates, passports, banning travel-- all unconstitutional. 

It’s not. You seem to think that the constitution is a free pass to do whatever the hell you want because anytime someone tells you no, you scream about “my freedoms. Constitution!”  [Here is](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/mass-torts/articles/2021/winter2022-not-breaking-news-mandatory-vaccination-has-been-constitutional-for-over-a-century/)some light reading material if you need help understanding this. 


> I'm going to generalize you for a moment

I’m so excited and I just can’t hide it. 

> you probably don't even care about the constitution 

Hahahahaha. That’s hilarious. Care about it? I mean, I don’t kiss it good night every time I go to bed. But I do care about it in general. Do you???  Because you clearly have a very skewed understanding of it.

"1st:  I'm a nurse.  I am required by NJ state law to have 3 covid vaccines. (As well as a host of other vaccines)

I have spent the last 2+ years watching people die.  Watching them bleed out of every orifice.  Watching them gasp for breath and beg for help as they drown in their own lungs.  I've watched them die slowly and painfully,  hooked up to machines, lying on their stomachs, alone.  

I've seen the ones who survived face long term disability from lung damage and blood clots that cause strokes and heart attacks.  

I've watched families destroyed.  Children left orphaned.  I watched one ant-vax patient beg her husband to get vaccinated before she went on the ventilator because she knew she was going to die and she didn't want her children orphaned.  That husband cried for the entirety of every, single visit, sobbing and lamenting that they refused vaccination.

I have watched colleagues suffer physically and mentally.   I am watching the health care system implode. 

I have been a nurse a very long time.  Through the AIDS crisis.  Through 9-11 and the threat of biological warfare.   Through H1N1  Through ebola. Through Zika.  I will tell you, unequivocally,  that I have never seen anything like this.  If you had told me that I would see medical staff re-using PPE or wearing rain coats and household cleaning gloves to treat patients I would have thought you were nuts. If you told me there would be a refrigerated truck in the parking lot full of dead bodies, I would have had psych evaluate you.

Part of living in a society means that it isn't always all about you.  Sometimes you have to do things to help or protect others. You don't spread potentially fatal diseases and you don't drive drunk.

Ian Smith is a narcissistic asshole.  He got sideways drunk and all kinds of high.  He plowed his car into a college student who was on his way to school to turn in a paper.  He, then, fled the scene, literally,  leaving that man for dead.  He never, once, apologized or accepted responsibility for his actions.  He took a life and he ruined many more.  He hasn't learned, he hasn't changed.

"From a non-paywalled

Cinnaminson police officer Harry Cicale issued six summonses to Smith, including reckless and careless driving after stopping the Republican House candidate on Route 130 North near Andover Road.

A campaign spokesman, Steve Kush, said Smith’s truck swerved in high winds and that he passed a field sobriety test.

“The cop wasn’t satisfied and put cuffs on him,” Kush said.  “Ian will have his day in court.  Everyone will find out Ian wasn’t drunk driving.”

Smith is scheduled to appear in Cinnaminson Municipal Court on April 14.

Kush said Smith refused the breathalyzer test out of fear that Cicale, a former standout Cinnaminson High School baseball player, might be trying to set him up.

“Ian doesn’t have much trust of the government after the persecution he’s received by the governor over the last two years,” Kush stated.

So your stance is that an officer conspired with the wind to create a situation that forced Ian Smith to refuse a breathalyzer?

"That’s exactly right. The bank will never be effected in a significant way by one bank robbery. The only people who are truly effected by it are the ones who are there making very little money, getting little respect, and are in the most danger in the event of a robbery.

"Its a very small area directly south of Gloucester City which used to be very bad, but has recently started turning around a little but, but still isnt a very desireable area IMO. 

This is all my own opinion and others may have different thoughts on the area but I would look elsewhere if schools matter at all to you. Brooklawn school district is small so they are only K-8th grade, which is great, but they rank in the 2nd lowest socioeconomic group (out of 8 groups) of NJ school districts, this means more limited resources, lower test scores, etc. 

High school options are not much better unless you shell out for private school. Since they are so close to Gloucester City, they attend Gloucester City High after finishing K-8, and GCHS is in the bottom 20% of NJ high schoools

Low diversity, town is around\~80% white/low income families. White poverty is nearly double the state average in brooklawn (6% NJ avg vs 11% brooklawn)

Median income is below state average and the poverty rate is above the state average, so I would be weary of buying here at inflated prices since it seems like the town in primed to be hit hardest by inflation and a stagnant real estate market if that occurs so buyer beware.",t2_v5t18,ald1897,0,1648484728.0,0,t1_i2gd4vw,i2gd4vw,False,uktousaexport,t3_t6kamc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthJersey/comments/t6kamc/possibly_moving_to_south_jersey_from_the_uk_and/,Possibly moving to South Jersey from the UK and need some local advice about Camden County.,/r/SouthJersey/comments/t6kamc/possibly_moving_to_south_jersey_from_the_uk_and/i2gd4vw/,1,r/SouthJersey,0,1
