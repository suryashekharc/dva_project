"I was really confused what the thing on the ice was for a while.

My dog fell into one of those wetland ponds in December and I’m surprised how deep those things are. The ice cracked beneath her and she was basically submerged, holding onto the ice with just her paws and head poking out.
I panicked, went around the pond to be as close as possible and did the whole belly slide thing to try and get her to swim toward me. She grabbed onto the ice near me and caused it to crack, sending me into the water with her.
Again, this water was **deep**. I’m 5’4 and once I realised my feet could touch the bottom, the water was up to my chin. I managed to push her out and ice breaker my way to shore, but it was definitely a terrifying situation.

"Correct. They used to have an easy to use, fully functional online banking platform— they switched to one with “eye candy” as some higher ups might see it and now it is a terrible interface to work with.

I have asked several times for someone higher up to contact me by phone so that I can share issues with them — the customer service rep says message has been passed along, BUT they never call me. 

So besides a terrible web interface, their upper management for customer relations sucks. They don’t care about what their members think.

There are a lot of other issues too.  Several people I know have switched to other banks. I have been with them since my first ever bank account, but I will likely switch too. Only thing keeping me right now is my grandfathered “free chequing” account.

I'm not disagreeing with you. But, that doesn't change that our flight security rules are heavily influenced by international rules.

Also, you are can be federally protected from being prosecuted from possession if you call 911 to report overdose. Doesn't matter if you are also using and want to call to save your ODing friend, you will be protected as well.

"That's the sea salt one? If so, here is how to make a decent equivalent at home. 1/4 cup of neutral oil (corn oil or refined coconut oil is best, any oil that doesn't have a strong flavour and a decently high smoke point) and 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels, plus salt. The salt is what makes or breaks homemade popcorn. Just shaking a salt shaker won't cut it, you need to turn the salt into a fine powder by putting it into a coffee grinder or food processor. I like to add the salt with the oil in the beginning but you do you. 

Heat the oil on medium-high heat with a couple kernels, once the kernels pop put in the rest of the popcorn, cover and remove from the element for 60 seconds. Return to the element and shake until the popcorn is popped. Remember to leave a small space in the lid to let steam escape.

"Hey same here. I bought the one called Chortau from Amazon. I noticed yesterday that it didn’t hold the timestamp, 1st I thought it didn’t record anything after Jan and that the files were protected, but that’s not the case. Could also be because I was on vacation for 3 weeks and disconnected the cam, the battery could have died completely. 

For needing to frequently clear the memory, check if the files get locked/protected quite often, this happens mostly because the G-sensor (gravity) is too sensitive sometimes (locks the video files even on small bumps etc) . The companies recommend turning it off (which means it may not lock the file during an accident, not sure). But try changing that setting to low or medium if it cam does have a g sensor and if it’s set to high or something. Mine was literally off. I changed it to low now. So I’ll monitor my timestamp and if files get locked often and maybe change g sensor to medium accordingly.

Update: 
I saw the specs of Orbit130. It does have a G-sensor and It supports 32GB card, the same as mine. 32GB can store around 3 hours of videos max I guess at 1080p, or could be less with 2 cams running simultaneously. Didn’t check that yet. I bought pack of 2 cards of 32GB each, spare just so that I can exchange them if I want to retain some good views while I go far to Banff, Jasper etc. 

 I’d say go through all your settings and change them according to your needs. Like see if it’s actually recording at 1080p by default. Hopefully it holds these settings at least if not the timestamp. They usually have a very small battery capacity just to store everything and shutdown properly when you turn off the ignition.",t2_563z04ou,life_is_enjoy,0,1648997408.0,0,t1_i388u6n,i388u6n,False,Suitable-Cat-9531,t3_ttbk3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/ttbk3w/i_have_a_question_for_anyone_following_one_car/,"I have a question for anyone following one car length behind people on Deerfoot, going 110km/h.",/r/Calgary/comments/ttbk3w/i_have_a_question_for_anyone_following_one_car/i388u6n/,2,r/Calgary,0,2

"If the mountains are looking really nice that day, a couple of the nicest places to see them in your car from within the city are:
- WB Stoney Trail NW after Shaganappi and down to 16th Ave
- WB Memorial Drive from 36 St SE towards downtown
- SB Deerfoot on the Calf Robe Bridge

Other nice views (of downtown mostly) are:
- continuing down Memorial WB past downtown (or you might exit onto the 4th Avenue flyover or turn left onto Edmonton Trail to get into the DT core from here)
- EB Bow Trail on the hill between Old Banff Coach Road and Sarcee Trail, and again after 33 St. SW 
- SB Sarcee Trail SW from 16th Ave to Bow Trail, though the view is all out your driver's side window 

You can also get a nice inner city drive (old trees, big houses, hills) by tooling around any of the side streets in Upper Mount Royal or Elbow Park. On the main streets, I always liked the SB drive down 14th St SW from roughly 16th Ave, south to your left turn at 38th Ave/Sifton Blvd, right turn on Elbow Drive and then a right turn on 50th Ave SW to take the hilly driveway down into the parking lot of the Calgary Golf and Country Club.",t2_4d6xgj8v,wjl_yyc,0,1648994935.0,0,t1_i383i9x,i383i9x,True,PhilthyMcNasty,t3_tv8a4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/tv8a4c/best_drives_around_the_city/,Best Drives Around the City?,/r/Calgary/comments/tv8a4c/best_drives_around_the_city/i383i9x/,6,r/Calgary,0,6

"Definitely head either to 007 airsoft/Direct ops simulations in the NE or come out to Rampage Paintball and airsoft near millarville and rent some gear for the day before you buy a bunch of stuff only to find its not his thing (it's rare, but it happens. Most people try it and love it lol)

Direct ops has public games I think most nights with friday-sunday being busier obviously. They have rental guns, but you do have to buy eye/face protection which is about 20$ but it's yours and it will keep his eyes and teeth where they should be.

Rampage has public games every weekend (just opened for the year yesterday actually) hosted by a group I'm with  we do safety briefing at 10am and play usually till 4-6pm depending on how many players are still there as the day goes on. I think our community is amazing, we work hard to be welcoming to all players regardless of skill level, age, gender, budget etc. As long as u call your hits, and don't act like a dick most people are awesome and helpful. Saturdays we usually have 20-40 players, Sundays are usually in the 50-80 range, and once a month we host our ""big games"" with longer more objective based games that have seen numbers in the 120+range so lots of fun.

We focus on the sport being FUN. It's competitive of course, but at the end of the day, we are running around slinging plastic at our friends.

"Thanks for admitting that this sort of behavior shouldn't be tolerated. That suggestion often gets downvoted to hell here. Many do have underlying mental health issues, but mental health isn't a thing that you just apply to someone. It's a process and if someone's too strung out to engage in that process and has no interest in it, you spin your wheels, spend a lot of money and make absolutely zero progress. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen case workers health care providers, doctors, begging for clients to be arrested for their shitty behavior. The hope is they might have a couple days of no use to make any headway. At least where I practice there is zero capacity to force treatment on people so we spend a lot of money, do a whole lot of work, for worse outcomes.

It has never made any sense to me why we force schizophrenics to take anti-psychotics or keep demented old people in locked facilities... But allow mentally ill destitute addicts to ""make their own health choices ."" And then allow entire communities to be overrun with dangerous antisocial behavior all under the guise of being harm reduction based. I've never been convinced that handing a destitute addict a needle and saying it's all going to be fine is appropriate, it's a lie. It's not caring. It's not kind. It's not helpful.

"We never had this problem this badly before they made tamper proof pills (oxy neos) & cut down legal supply which fed the illegal market yes but at least they were pharma grade opiates.

"The frequency may be low, but if we were to successfully encourage more people to bike to work, the we could see an increase. The insurance most likely wouldn't be very expensive, I think $10-$20 bucks a month would be fair.  I understand that they are obligated to stay around, doesn't mean they would. Even if they did, with out insurance you are now forced to sue them for damages.  I can't even legally park my car on the street if it's not insured.

I agree the best solution would be infrastructure that keeps these two modes of transport separate, ensuring rider safety and negating the need for additional rules.  At the end of the day though, there are rules to be followed to be allowed to be on the road, some, not all cyclists want the rights with out undertaking any of the responsibilities. Some even make a point of being ignorant and there currently isn't really any legal standing to deter them from doing so.

"I fundamentally disagree. The low frequency of cyclist accidents causing property damage or injury makes registration and insurance an unnecessary burden. I'm currently capable of paying for insurance if required, but there are many people for whom that would be a problem. If a cyclist hits and injures someone, they are obligated to remain on scene, and it would be a hit and run if they don't. The same applies to registered motor vehicles.
As a society, we need to do more to encourage cycling. It is an economic, healthy, and generally enjoyable mode of transportation. What if we reduced the speed limits of all non-highways to 20kph? Or drivers can learn to be a bit more patient. Honestly, most roads that have only one lane should not be a busy enough thoroughfare to bother drivers, and any road with 2 lanes is exceptionally easy to pass a cyclist on (if it's not it is the other vehicle traffic slowing you down and not the cyclist)
I'm also not sure about your minimum speed rule. I'd like to see the regulation, especially in regards to city streets, where the default speed limit is 40kph. Doing 25 in a 40 is possibly slowing the flow of traffic, but certainly not unsafely slow (like 25 in an 80).

Ultimately the minor inconvenience of having to pass or wait for a cyclist is a small price to pay for cyclists to be able to use public infrastructure for transportation. An obvious answer is more high-quality cycling-specific infrastructure, as I'm sure you'd agree.",t2_vilw2,Dethbridge,0,1648978101.0,0,t1_i37ee51,i37ee51,False,Rw3HRfZ5BLraB,t3_tutb4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/tutb4q/i_just_saw_three_cyclists_almost_get_run_over_by/,I just saw three cyclists almost get run over by two different trucks,/r/Calgary/comments/tutb4q/i_just_saw_three_cyclists_almost_get_run_over_by/i37ee51/,2,r/Calgary,0,2

"There may not be a minimum speed limit, but there is a rule stating that if a vehicle can't/will not be exceeding 40km/h, it needs to be properly identified with the reflective ""slow moving vehicle"" triangle.

I guarantee you a cop would pull someone over for doing 20 in a 50 if they were in a car, so your argument that there isn't a minimum speed doesn't exactly hold up.

Also, you didn't address that they don't require insurance or a license. While it may be rare, if a cyclist makes a mistake and causes an accident in which they aren't seriously injured, they could just flee the scene and any damage done to the other party would be extremely hard to get the insured vehicle fixed not out of pocket.

"It actually is a law, that is both following orders, and not bringing disrepute to the police service. The Alberta Police Service Regulations has a list of actions that police officers cannot engage in. It contains both ""discreditable conduct"" and ""insubordination"". 

https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/laws/regu/alta-reg-356-1990/latest/alta-reg-356-1990.html#sec5subsec1

---

Discreditable conduct includes as the last item: 

(viii) doing anything prejudicial to discipline or likely to bring discredit on the reputation of the police service;""

which could mean either ignoring a direct order, and/or wearing a badge that the public sees as ""wrong"", is breaking this law.

---

Insubordination has only 2 items: 

(i) being insubordinate to a superior police officer by word or action;

(ii) omitting or neglecting, without adequate reason, to carry out a lawful order, directive, rule or policy of the commission, the chief of police or other person who has the authority to issue or make that order, directive, rule or policy;

So ignoring an order, or directive, that the commission or person of authority gives, breaks this law.

"I question how it is decided which co-opted symbols are allowed to remain and which should be banished.  The thin blue line is culturally significant to those who chose to risk their lives to serve and protect, and despite this the police commission gave them a scant two days to accept the loss of this symbol at the threat of punishment.  The Canadian flag has recently been co-opted by the “freedom convoy” in their pursuit of civil disobedience- should we therefore ban the Canadian flag?  The Catholic Church has committed great atrocities under the symbol of the cross, and yet our own mayor has committed funds to fight the banning of these symbols in Quebec.  I fear our mayor and police commissioners are merely hypocrites that are bandying for the favour of the squeakiest wheels.

"I don't think that you realize how disruptive these protests have become since January. I live across from Central Memorial Park and Saturdays over the last few months have been absolutely terrible (before CPS started doing their jobs). Before the Ottawa stuff happened they were slightly annoying, but definitely tolerable.

To give you an idea of what residents have been dealing with for the last few months:

\- cars and trucks constantly circled my block honking from 12-3ish, some with semi/train/fog horns. It got to the point where I could identify the vehicles involved from my balcony. My dog would hide under my bed the entire time if I was home.

\- the marches down 12th ave meant that I couldn't get in or out of my parkade for the entire 30-60 min that people were going down it. It's a 1-way street and the 500-1,000+ people would clog it up for a significant period of time. I would regularly leave my apartment to head to the dog park and would then get stuck on my way home if I mistimed my day.

I would be surprised if you thought this was reasonable if it happened near your house, so what justifies it near the thousands of people that live in Beltline?

"I call bs on your claims. 

> The driver's side tire must be 12"" or less from the curb.

Let’s examine the logic of this statement. 


> The law requires that the wheels of the parked vehicle not be more than 50 centimetres from the curb.

[Source](https://www.alberta.ca/parking.aspx)

Doesn’t indicate which wheel, which makes sense because on a one-way street, you can park with the curb closest to the driver’s side wheels if you’re parked in the far left lane. 

From the Government of Alberta website, the distance is 50cm from the curb. 

50cm = 20”

20” > 12”

> The average car's width is between 70"", or 5'10"", and 80"", or 6'8"".

[Source](https://vehq.com/how-wide-is-car/)

With the exception of special circumstances, I really don’t understand how your claim would work when the width of the average vehicle would consistently place the driver’s side wheels significantly more than 20” from the curb.

"As someone who has a history of mental illness, and having experimented with drugs in my youth. I found myself drawn towards substances that rid me of my anxiety.

I have thought ever since how easy it could be for someone to slip into that life If they had no stability or positive foundation. All it takes is one moment of weakness. In my darkest moments, if someone would have offered my pills, I would have taken them to get rid of my ailment. Nobody grows up wanting to stick a needle in their arm, or rail fentanyl. You ask most of these people and they are suffering, one way or another. These ""leeches"" aren't living their best life, they are in hell. With or without self-medication.
