"There are a lot of highly educated white collar professionals in Winona - Physicians (WH, Gunderson, and Mayo commuters), Engineers (Benchmark, Watlow, Fastenal, Peerless, etc), and Professors (3 colleges/universities).  These are professions with authority (order treatments, make pronouncements, design infrastructure, etc), and the sense of ""I know what I'm talking about, do it my way"" bleeds over beyond the office.  School board meetings, letters to the editor, and ""Save our schools"" campaigns can get pretty wild.  

I've heard that there are (or were?) more millionaires per capita in Winona than anywhere else in MN.  Eg, Miller is the leader of the MN senate primarily because of his connections with weathy donors.  

So, parts of Winona, and parts of the school district are exactly like a wealthy Minneapolis suburb.  Other parts of Winona are quite poor, and the schools match that reality.  

Previous school superintendents were truly terrible, but the new one seems ok.  There's also a Spanish-language immersion program at the Elementary level that seems really neat.  It does seem common for kids to switch to the Catholic system at 5th-8th grade because of bullying at the public middle school.

"7-12 should be fine in the same building.  9-12 already are, so really what's the difference?  There's only around 150 kids per grade these days, so it wouldn't be hard to separate them in the high school.  It's also the cheapest option by far compared to moving things around between the existing elementary schools.  

I don't have any kids in the middle school yet, so I don't know any specifics there.  Mine have had their fair share of bullying either in school or on the bus, and the incidents on the bus aren't kids in their school, and can't be removed from the bus without their parent's permission no matter how bad they get.

"The schools are fine.  there's some bullying, but there always has been and always will be, that's what kids do.  

The Elementary schools are all fairly old, and either need to have a bunch of money put in to update them (again), or just close them and move the K-6 to the middle school and 7-12 to the high school, which would line up with teaching certifications in the state.  They're going to get a ton of pushback on that plan because people like the idea of ""neighborhood elementary schools"", and are nostalgic about their kids going to the same schools they did as kids.  

The alternative options have their flaws as well.  I know from personal experience that the first few grades in the Lutheran schools are literally years behind the first few grades at the public schools, because they push the religion super hard in those years.

John was the worst landlord ever. Could never reach him or maintenance to fix issues or ask questions. Tried to come after my roommates and I for damage that was pre-existing and was only saved by photos that I took at the beginning of the year. 

Abramson properties was also horrid. Apts are made to look nice but are SHITHOLES. Everything breaks, and no maintenance person will come ever. We made numerous complaints about loud noises and a repeated domestic assault issue that went unresolved for the duration of our stay at that apartment.

"It’s really hard to find places around now. For some reason, a lot of landlords start to post around September-November for June 1st. Like, my landlord asked if I wanted to renew my lease for next year (2022-2023) in September. And I signed my June 2020-2021 lease in November of 2019. I think the off-campus student housing is just ultra competitive, especially with SMU, MSC Southeast, and WSU all being in Winona. Landlords will keep posting, though. I’d keep checking back and definitely don’t be shy if you see something you like. Try to apply/schedule a tour right away, as it’ll likely get scooped up fast.  I was renting through WSYou before and they were good to me, but I’m not sure if they have much available anymore—check their website, if you can. They sometimes don’t post certain apartments on the rental websites. Their rent was reasonable and they had an online portal for  rent payment and maintenance requests. I never waited more than 24 hours for them to check on things that weren’t working. I’m actually giving up my one bedroom apartment in June, but my building was sold recently and I’m not sure if the new managers have even posted it. If someone already signed for it, they must not have even seen it in person because nobody has been in for a tour. I’d also avoid Winona PM, as another comment mentioned. I’ve heard nothing but bad things from them and one of the owners was very rude to me when just inquiring about an apartment. 

If you’re open to roommates (and I totally get if you aren’t honestly, I’m not either), a lot of people post on the Facebook groups. There’s one for transfer students and for each graduating class. The upside to this is usually you get your own locked bedroom and rent is really cheap (usually like $350-$400 a month). The downside is obviously typical roommate stuff, though.

Also, as I saw someone mention internet—if you get the Pell Grant, look into the federal emergency broadband benefit. I was previously paying $55 a month for internet with spectrum, but I’m currently paying $5 a month with the benefit. I’m not sure how long they’ll continue it, because it’s a Covid thing, but it definitely helps.

They are losing volunteers due to a rather over dramatic change in leadership.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"Thanks for the response. I agree as I have observed that since I’ve lived here. It probably would never be realistic for someone working full-time (possibly multiple jobs) to also dedicate the amount of time it would take to condition their bodies, refine their skills, and perform or compete. I try to target the college students because their schedules tend to be a little more flexible but they also will be more inclined to join their college team.  Which I don’t blame them because it’s more fun to be on a college team. I have considered just opening a dance company to teach kids instead but the only reason I haven’t is because there are already two in the area and I definitely don’t think Winona’s population is large enough for a third dance company to be profitable.",t2_b7z66fu9,dreamcatcher909_,0,1627092773.0,0,t1_h6blk2e,h6blk2e,False,[deleted],t3_oqcyr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winona/comments/oqcyr6/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Winona/comments/oqcyr6/deleted_by_user/h6blk2e/,2,r/Winona,0,2

">I think it’s a really great opportunity for people who have aged out of their dance studios and still want to compete or people who are looking to continue dancing after high school or college.

Unfortunately I think your demographic isn't in Winona. Lately there have been more people of that age range sticking around after college but many, many of them take off for jobs in higher paying locations (that probably also have higher costs of living but they won't figure that out for 3-5 years).

"According to the Winona County GIS parcel data, it's owned by Hiatt Industries. They do wire-metal forming and fabricating (things like dishwasher racks), and their main location is on Theurer Boulevard in Goodview. My guess is they're either expanding their manufacturing capacity or building a warehouse for finished product and/or raw material.

Bottom line... Nothing interesting. Makes sense though, considering that location is zoned for industrial.
