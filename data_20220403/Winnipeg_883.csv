Reddit: Content creators deserve to be paid!

Also reddit: I’m not paying for it though. 

Visual media is in a weird growing pain stage right now. Piracy is increasing again due to fragmentation of media streaming and the studios are too greedy to acknowledge that situation. Instead of partnering with each other to create a few mega sites that people subscribe to, they’re all insisting on their own proprietary sites and people have had enough. 

For example, if MGM, Paramount, and Sony for example partnered and made all their stuff available together on one site for like $25/month, I think it would sell. Instead they each want $15/month and people are pirating instead. They’re voting with their wallet and eventually, if enough people start dropping their streaming and pirating instead, perhaps the major studios will figure this out.",t2_8p7o9,Lordmorgoth666,0,1649000311.0,0,t1_i38ffmi,i38ffmi,False,Afraid_Swim_2251,t3_tv7wxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tv7wxf/tv_subscription_recommendations/,TV subscription recommendations,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tv7wxf/tv_subscription_recommendations/i38ffmi/,2,r/Winnipeg,0,2

"Access and cost used to reduce piracy significantly during the start of the media streaming phase. Unfortunately, access is now segmented across a dozen platforms and the cost continually rises. 

Arguably many of the available options today are DUE to piracy. Netflix and BBC both noted how the sale of physical media was dropping and piracy was becoming increasingly rampant due to increased consumer internet speeds. Both. shifted to streaming platforms in response. Years later, many followed. Creating our now fragmented and overpriced market that has apparently resulted in ""streaming fatigue"". So in response, piracy has risen again, and the market will slowly respond accordingly.

Netflix is probably the best in my opinion for paid services. Prime has decent options too and is a bit cheaper. Most services offer a free month trial so I would probably start with those and see which ones you use. There are some good free streaming options like CBC gem. Also Global and CTV are free but you usually only have 1 week to watch new episodes and then they are locked. If you have a library card you can also stream through Hoopla and Kanopy and there is some great stuff for free.,t2_gt1lr976,ghfstjk,0,1648992572.0,0,t1_i37yvir,i37yvir,True,Afraid_Swim_2251,t3_tv7wxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tv7wxf/tv_subscription_recommendations/,TV subscription recommendations,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tv7wxf/tv_subscription_recommendations/i37yvir/,2,r/Winnipeg,0,2

"Crave is losing lots of stuff to Paramount Plus.  Crave still has all the HBO stuff which could sustain me on a desert island for life.  Paramount Plus doesn’t have much yet but growing fast.

Netflix still has the strongest base of easy watching kind of stuff.

Apple and Amazon have a few shows but not much else.

I haven’t had Disney in awhile, hear it’s improved it was basically the back catalog of Disney movies when we had free trial.

The sad thing is you have to kind of move around them as you get into certain shows.  If you are smart about it you could work through one for a month or two, cancel and then work through the next.

I’m personally struggling with the streaming services because they are getting so diluted by having so many of them.

"I used to live in the Roslyn. I will say that I don’t believe in ghosts but I had one experience there that was particularly off putting. It’s still a little hard for me to rationalize it, so I figure it’s perfect for this thread. 

I lived in a three bedroom with a couple of guys when we were in our early years of university. These guys were very social, and part of the same circle so it wasn’t uncommon for us to have several visitors hanging out pretty late into the night on any given day. The apartment was huge though, and I can sleep through a lot so I never really minded the noise. One night I woke up at probably about 3 am and I could hear voices coming from our living room. It was a little loud, but not distinct and I remember thinking that it might’ve been a half asleep thing. So I sat up for a good 30 seconds slapping my face a bit and the sound was still there. Curious, I hopped out of bed and poked my head out of my door. 

Our apartment was basically laid out in one long line, with the living room at one end, followed by the bedrooms, and then the kitchen on the other with one long narrow hallway connecting them all. My room was near the middle, so when I poked my head out and looked toward the living room, I could hear the sounds and see a little light but I couldn’t see directly into the living room itself. Still the voices seemed muddy and I couldn’t tell who was there, but I couldn’t go check because I still hadn’t put my pants on. So I go back in my room, get dressed and head back into the hallway so I can go see what’s up. But when I opened my door again it was suddenly completely silent and dark. The light I saw and the voices were just gone. Not only that, but when I went to explore the apartment I found that my roommates weren’t even home and I was the only one there. 

I didn’t believe in ghosts then, and I still don’t but that night really shook me good for a little while. I’m familiar with sleep paralysis and hallucination, and I still attribute this experience to something like that, but I was legitimately awake and walking around for nearly a minute and I know I saw light and heard those voices.  It didn’t feel malicious or anything, but it was definitely spooky. I never personally experienced anything else in that building, but I’m not very sensitive to these things and I know plenty of other people who lived there that have their own stories. Pretty cool place to live though.",t2_4e0rr,Haart,0,1648973901.0,0,t1_i379bi7,i379bi7,True,FourDrunkMoms,t3_tuu7it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tuu7it/does_anyone_have_good_stories_about_experiencing/,does anyone have good stories about experiencing hauntings Winnipeg first hand?,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tuu7it/does_anyone_have_good_stories_about_experiencing/i379bi7/,1,r/Winnipeg,0,1

"I'm always surprised to hear stories about the hotel being haunted. I worked at the Fort Garry for over a year, was all over the place. I wasn't ever in room 202, but I was on the second floor plenty of times, and I waited many times late at night in the lounge for the shuttle service to take me home after a shift. We're talking 'witching hour' late, after the busses had stopped running and when people report getting wakened. 

I never saw or felt anything to make me believe something supernatural was happening. I even stayed in rooms a few times when we were super busy and I didn't have 8 hours between my one shift ending and another shift starting, so they were obliged to put me up. Nothing spooky, no weird noises (beyond what you'd expect in a 100-year-old building), no supernatural phenomena.

"This was just outside of Dugald MB towards Winnipeg. Not sure how old the house was or anything but it was a single level house with a basement. Not sure if any of this is legit but weird stuff we noticed that didnt have an explanation we were aware of.

Couple blood or blood like occurances, not sure which happened first to be honest. Blood stain on the toilet paper roll after we finished showering together, that was not there before (small drop/smear). Another time we were rough housing in my boyfriends room in the basement when suddenly my boyfriend stops and turns the light on. There is a blood stain on my face and it was not blood from either of us.

When we were in bed my boyfriend had already passed out and was mumbling things. He asked me ""who is beside the bed?"" and I look and there is a motherfuckin figure there. But I just pretended not to see anything and hid under the blankets. My boyfriend did not remember telling me this the next day.

Another night my boyfriend walked out of his room then the lights in his room flashed on then went out. His texts send/recieve (they werent before) and his lightbulbs are fried.

We move into an apartment in Southdale and we find a piece of my boyfriend's old desk from his room randomly on the floor in the new apartment one night and it is really warm as well.

"Front loaders are mold factories, far worse than top loaders. Try cleaning the machine and leave the door open after you use it so it can dry and air out any remaining humidity 

It might be worth trying it without the fabric softener. In some cases, the fabric softener can add a coating to the fabric that affects its ability to absorb water, which can affect your ability to wash the fabric. Things that rely on absorbency, like towels and cloth diapers, shouldn’t ever be washed with fabric softener for that reason. Using white vinegar in the load can help strip off any residual fabric softener and also helps eliminate odours

The third event happened when our son was one. I was laying in bed, looking at my phone, and I heard screaming coming from the baby monitor. The screaming sounded like it was coming from miles away.

"Former roofer here, did everything from residential to shops to hip roof barns to commercial with metal. Metal roofs shouldn’t be much more expensive than a shingled roof. A metal roof should be a ‘lifetime’ roof. Should last 40-50+ years no problem. As long as you replace screws every 5-10 years. As another commenter posted, the rubber grommet wears out and thats where leaks start. The screws are cheap too. Yes it will be louder than a shingled roof but there is solutions to that too. We would normally strap the roof with 1x4 (nailed through sheets to trusses) for the screws, but if you’re willing, use 2x4 with rigid foam insulation between to dampen the sound.

He said his car was always covered in snow because it would slide off the roof and whump onto the car, or leave a big pile in the middle of the driveway.

"From my experience of watching the house market extensively from mid-2020 until late 2021, houses in the $200 - $300K range are almost all going to be needing renovations/foundation work, potentially completely gutted and renovated, or even tear downs with rebuilds. I don’t think it even mattered which area that you’d be looking, although I was looking in very specific areas. It wasn’t until I decided I could financially afford to jump price ranges to the $300 - $400K range that I started seeing houses which were more “move-in ready”. The competition was still strong, but the houses were in better condition. Some needed cosmetic work, but you can live with that for a while. 

I think being pre-approved for a mortgage, and the amount of downpayment you’re willing to put down can really affect your offer. The higher downpayment, the more financially sound you’d be (theoretically) so you’d avoid being put on CMHC insurance. 10+ people putting offers in on a house will drive up the price, and I never found it worthwhile to bid on houses where I knew 10+ people were bidding because I’d always be outbid. I don’t think people always factor in if they can actually financially afford what they’re offering (especially keeping in mind the closing costs). Keep that in mind because once the interest rates start raising even more, I suspect we’ll see resells from people who can’t afford their homes.

Quality of the house can also affect the price (i.e. obviously broken foundation, potentially lower bids, a flipped house with brand new everything would have higher bids). Selfishness affects sales (overpriced listing). You definitely need to look at what some of the other houses are listed at and selling at to get an idea of a realistic price (even with these inflated prices) for the area and not get caught up in the hype of overbidding. 

Ultimately, I’m happy with the amount I paid for my house because I still stayed within my budget, so I know I can financially afford it. I got a solid house in a decent area, which happily met all of my criteria of what I was looking for. While it wasn’t the cheapest house on the block, it wasn’t the most expensive one either, and while you never want to own the cheapest house on the block, you also never want to own the most expensive house on the block either.

Here are some examples of what I observed:

A house I bid on was listed at $279K, sold for around $420K. It was definitely not worth that price. There were over 20 bids on it. 
Another house I bid on that was listed for $100K more ($380K), sold for around $410K. Not as high of an overbid in comparison, for a better quality house. 

Two houses were for sale on the same block as the one I bought my house on: 
One house went for around $70 or $80K over asking (I did bid over on mine, but not even close to that much over), it was 200 sqft less than mine, had a history of flooding in the basement, and a broken foundation. 
The second house started off with too high of an asking price. It was a flip that someone bought a few months previously and tried listing for $150K+ over what they purchased it for, and I doubt they poured that amount of money into renovations. They never sold it. Took down the listing, and relisted it at about $80K less than their original listing price (which they had lowered a couple of times), and finally sold it. I’m not sure what they sold it for though.

I saw a house with a really shitty foundation, and it sold for only $5K over. I believe it sold purely for the area that it was located.
Another one sold for $10K UNDER, but also a really bad foundation and previous owners had been heavy smokers. 
A third one was a complete tear down, listed around $280K and it sold for $30K OVER, but again, only purchased for the land value of the area. $30K over for a tear down?? Insanity. 

There was a house where the layout was just too odd, no bathroom on the second floor, odd shaped kitchen, a tiny hallway to a tiny supply closet), this weird DIY subway tile bathroom in the basement, etc, and it ultimately never sold. It was originally listed at $250K. They took the listing down. Re-listed it at $290K - they claimed to have renovated the back deck, lowered to $260K, eventually lowered to $240K and it still never sold. This one had some good upgrades (windows, hwt) but that wasn’t enough to sell it because something about it just wasn’t right.  

TLDR: price range, overbidding (10+ people putting offers in on one house just drives up the price and is a waste of time), house quality, and finances can affect the price. I’m happy with my house, and although I did bid over, I also stayed within the range of what I could financially afford.",t2_4w08v8h4,CrossAnimaling,0,1648947531.0,0,t1_i3640fm,i3640fm,True,blackflag2792,t3_tfo0m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tfo0m2/housing_prices_these_days/,Housing Prices These Days,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tfo0m2/housing_prices_these_days/i3640fm/,1,r/Winnipeg,0,1

"First let's get this out of the way, the Covid antiviral medications are very available if you truly need them. If you have any questions about it you start by calling Healthlinks. I am not sure why they have it structured the way they do bur that's how it's done. 

Next let's address you have a real fucked up sense of what ""lucky"" means if you thinking getting Covid makes someone ""lucky"". That's why you're getting downvoted to hell for your idiotic comments.

I ended up getting Covid because the provicnde felt the need to declare the pandemic over. My partner had to go back to working from their office. A coworker got Covid, came into the office and because masks are optional now they didn't wear one. My partner had their KN95 mask on but still caught in and brought it home. By the time they realized it I had been exposed.

The Monocol Antibodies have been found to be ineffective against the current strain so their use is limited or non-existent now. Remdesivir needs to be administered by iv once a day for 10 consecutive days making use outside of in-patient scenarios extremely impractical. Of the treatments approved in Canada that leaves Paxlovid which is available.

Now in terms of the restrictions on Paxlovid. Based on the screening process interaction with other drugs is definitely a strong concern of the medical community. I knew a bit about possible treatments before getting Covid as I knew I was considered to be at high risk. What people don't seem to get is Paxlovid itself is a very unpleasant drug and **WILL** make you feel sick on different ways than Covid. You need to take it twice a day for 5 consecutive days. You also need to be aware enough of your own health enough to pinpoint when you got Covid as treatment needs to be started within about 48 hours of symptoms starting. Let me tell you after the first day of Paxlovid I really wanted to quit taking it and that is with really understanding what I was getting into and having lots of coping mechanisms for the common side effects.

I'm finishing up day 3 now and today is when I shifted from feeling Covid to feeling Paxlovid. I did a home rapid test today though and it still is definitively positive.

If anyone reading this has questions about my experience my DMs are open but I have felt things intentionally vague about the process and where the drug comes from once you are approved",t2_a7uv5pay,AnonymousExisting,0,1648945087.0,0,t1_i363inr,i363inr,True,Red_orange_indigo,t3_tuofls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tuofls/who_is_responsible_for_the_antiviral_restrictions/,Who is responsible for the antiviral restrictions in MB?,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tuofls/who_is_responsible_for_the_antiviral_restrictions/i363inr/,3,r/Winnipeg,0,3

"My home was built in 2006 as were most of the homes on my street. It’s like someone took a giant hair dryer to all the houses here as the shingles are all curling up pretty much in the order the houses were built. 

You do make a good point about the venting and insulation. The shingles are best on the side of the house that doesn’t have vaulted ceilings. Even better on the garage though that has no insulation but the best ventilation. 

Worst is where the garage roof and the house roof join as that’s where a lot of water gets channeled.",t2_7pgcs,demetri_k,0,1648943079.0,0,t1_i35zzqs,i35zzqs,False,demetri_k,t3_tuq9s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tuq9s9/metal_roofs_in_winnipeg_are_they_a_good_choice/,"Metal roofs in Winnipeg, are they a good choice for homes?",/r/Winnipeg/comments/tuq9s9/metal_roofs_in_winnipeg_are_they_a_good_choice/i35zzqs/,1,r/Winnipeg,0,1
"I worked at the Pantages Playhouse theatre and had two weird things happen:   


1) there's a room we called the ""sand room"", which was originally supposed to be a tunnel to city hall (I was told). We kept a huge freezer for ice cream in the sand room. I was a bartender and before shows, we would have to stock our bar and sometimes that meant getting more ice cream. I was in the sandroom, getting ice cream, when I felt someone else in the room with me. I look deeper into the room and see a shadow shaped like a man standing still. It was solid and looked like the outline of a man who was a little taller than me (I'm 5'10""). It took one step towards me and I bolted.   


2) We were having a party in the new part of the building and my boss wanted me to get a mirror from backstage for one of the displays we had. I took a shortcut through the theatre and hopped onto the stage. I grabbed the nearest mirror off to one side of the wings. As I was walking across the stage, I heard something in the balcony that sounded like a theatre chair bottom being brought back up to the top. I looked at the balcony and saw a shadow man looking at me from the side of the balcony near the fire exit door. It didn't move but it kept watching me. I hauled ass right back to the new part of the theatre but was terrified running under the balcony to get out.",t2_1hgoyep3,sonimusprime,0,1648942814.0,0,t1_i35zgm2,i35zgm2,True,FourDrunkMoms,t3_tuu7it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/tuu7it/does_anyone_have_good_stories_about_experiencing/,does anyone have good stories about experiencing hauntings Winnipeg first hand?,/r/Winnipeg/comments/tuu7it/does_anyone_have_good_stories_about_experiencing/i35zgm2/,17,r/Winnipeg,0,17

"What concerns me is people will split the vote between Liberal and NDP allowing the conservatives to squeek in.  Historically whenever the Liberals do well, it benefits the Conservatives.  Look at what happened in the recent bi-election.  Sure, the Liberals did better than the NDP, but the vote split ensured Khan got in.  Although the Liberals did better in this riding, it's not the general case.  In most ridings a vote for the Liberals is a vote for the PCs.  

It's not the 25% that concerns me (there's no hope for them) - it's the people who think they can vote out the conservatives by voting Liberal or Green.  One might say ""I'm voting Liberal (or Green) to send the conservatives a message"".  The end result is this message will not be heard.

"**Article**:

The province is closing all COVID-19 testing sites and pulling the plug on contact tracing — putting hundreds out of work — as the government winds down its pandemic response, despite growing fears a new wave is just around the corner.


The call-centre firm 24-7 Intouch laid off staff involved in contact tracing Thursday, with other layoffs planned for vaccine booking, according to internal emails obtained by the Free Press.


""We were suddenly made aware that our work supporting the Government of Manitoba’s COVID-19 efforts was ending on March 31, 2022 and we rushed to inform everyone immediately,"" reads an internal note to employees from company executives.
""With short notice, we continued to work to preserve jobs in the program, but were unsuccessful.""


Provincial officials dodged interview requests, but insisted that 24-7 Intouch wasn’t caught off-guard as the $61 million contract had long been set to expire Thursday.


In any case, the Manitoba Nurses Union argues Winnipeggers are being left without a buoy as COVID-19 waves hit other provinces.


""Are we going to see a (new) wave, right as we’re trying to ramp up surgeries?"" said union president Darlene Jackson.


""Nobody knows if they’re positive, so it’s very scary right now for nurses.""


As of Friday, public-health officials will no longer inform the few people who could access PCR tests about their results. Testing centres are set to close April 15, with the exception of those run by some inner-city groups.


Thursday marked the last COVID-19 bulletin to explain the region, gender and age of deaths reported during the previous week. From now on, Manitoba will report deaths and confirmed cases in a weekly brief with less detail, similar to influenza surveillance. The definition of a COVID-19 death has also been curtailed to exclude people who also had certain illnesses.


University of Saskatchewan epidemiologist Nazeem Muhajarine said that makes it impossible to tell if Manitoba is in a new wave until virus cases begin to once again strain the health-care system.


""With forgoing our ability to pick up (new) cases through confirmed testing, like molecular-based PCR, we have compromised our ability to really measure (new) cases of COVID-19,"" Muhajarine said.


""That then compromises our ability to say with confidence that we are seeing a sustained increase in cases, and therefore we have entered into a surge.""


Muhajarine, a professor based in Saskatoon, said Ontario seems to be entering a sixth wave, because it’s seeing a fast, exponential growth in cases that has continued to grow for more than a week.


Wastewater and absenteeism are other indicators that could indicate a surge, he said.
Generally speaking, Manitoba has been through five waves, with the last starting around Christmas and seeming to drop to a plateau in late February.


Wastewater data as of March 17 shows a slight rise of coronavirus load in one area of Winnipeg, with another static and a third in decline.


Jackson said nurses are seeing a gradual decline in hospital patients from the wave. But the worry is an anecdotal rise in Winnipeg infections will result in an onslaught of cases.
""I feel like we’re just starting to catch up, and waiting with bated breath to see whats going happen with this new (sub)variant,"" she said.




The Omicron variant’s BA.2 sub-strain is known to be relatively less severe than Delta, but even more contagious than the Omicron mutaion that maxed out Manitoba’s testing capacity in December when it spread like wildfire across the province.


Even if a minority of those infected end up in hospital, exhausted nurses are worried they’ll have a volume of patients large enough to cause surgeries to once again be delayed, Jackson said.


That’s possible, Muhajarine said, because by the time strain on a health-care system is observed there has already been widespread exposure to the coronavirus.


""We are not done with seeing people ending up in hospital needing care for COVID-19 yet, particularly after all the public-health measures have been lifted,"" he said.
""We are still in this. I think we will have some rough times ahead still, before it gets better.""


The Free Press requested interviews Thursday with Health Minister Audrey Gordon, chief provincial public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin, and his assistant, Dr. Jazz Atwal.
None were available; instead a spokesman said it’s up to Manitobans to protect themselves.



""As Manitoba transitions to this next phase of the pandemic, Public Health has advised our government that fluctuations in COVID-19 activity is expected and that vaccination, including a booster dose, continues to provide good protection against severe disease,"" wrote Gordon’s spokesman Draper Houston.


The government ""encourages Manitobans to follow public health recommendations"" — all of which are now optional, ""including staying home when sick"" and ""considering additional measures such as masking, physical distancing, and keeping gatherings small based on individual risk and preference.""
A Manitoba Health spokesperson told the Free Press ""an increase in cases following the removal of public health restrictions was expected.""



The opposition parties say the Progressive Conservatives are hiding the data amid an anecdotal rise in cases, making it impossible to tell whether Manitoba is in or about to enter a sixth wave.



""This government making the decision to not be transparent, and to withhold that data they have from Manitobans is a mistake,"" said NDP health critic Uzoma Asagwara.
""It doesn’t facilitate trust… in decision-making.""



The MLA argued the premier and cabinet need to be more visible and help the public understand where Manitoba is headed.
""The government puts out several (news) releases, randomly, with some pretty big changes to how we’ve all navigated this pandemic, and there’s nobody available to answer questions or explain why,"" said Asagwara.

""That isn’t leadership; that’s dodging accountability.""


Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont said that’s made worse by curtailing reports of outbreaks in schools and personal-care homes while limiting data and changing the definition of COVID-19 deaths.


""We’re completely flying blind,"" Lamont said. ""It’s all moving the goalposts to make things look better than they really are. And that means we’re ignoring the reality — that people are getting sick and there’s a real threat.""


Roussin last tweeted a week ago, and Premier Heather Stefanson has avoided all media since Sunday.


""Unfortunately, the premier is unavailable this week,"" a spokesman wrote Wednesday evening.


""Public Health has advised our government that if messaging is required, Public Health will set up a briefing at that time.""
It’s clear political decisions are driving the pandemic response — or lack thereof — in Manitoba, Lamont said.

""We’re seeing no signs whatsoever that the government is paying even attention, or that they’re interested,"" he said.

""They basically have shut up shop, when it comes to public health and preventing infections.""
