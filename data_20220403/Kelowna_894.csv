"I live downtown on Sunset Dr, close to Metro Liquor.

He looked down and shuffled around, I asked him ""Dude, just give me the stolen bike""  And viola, he handed it over to me without any fuss at all.  I threw it in the back of my truck and delivered it to Kelonwa RCMP, just a block away.  They mentioned the would try and get in touch with the owner.

"Gonna play devil‚Äôs advocate for a sec because I am a technician and this has happened to me several times. 

1) notice goes out to tenants 99% of the time and in nearly every case, not every tenant hears about it. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much notice is posted or emailed or what have you, there‚Äôs always a handful of people in the building that don‚Äôt read postings or check their emails.

2) I have pounded on doors and announced my presence loudly multiple times before entering a suite and have still walked in on people sleeping. You can only do so much when entering a suite and if they don‚Äôt hear you for whatever reason, that isn‚Äôt the technicians fault.

3) I‚Äôm not saying OP is wrong here so don‚Äôt jump down my throat, but we can‚Äôt all blame the technician like they did something wrong. I‚Äôve done this job for 12 years and nearly every residential building I go to has at least a few people that don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre coming even when we follow every possible step.

That being said, if no notice was given the technician should have refused to enter suites.

"If over 200 people were willing to pay that price, thats a clear indication that it was under priced in this market actually. Im fairly confident I could've rented it out for $3800 - $4200 if I was willing to rent out to roomates/families. I under priced it to attract a specific type of renter.

It's the 3rd most expensive city in Canada, if you don't like it - move to AB/prairies. I was priced out of my hometown but don't complain about it.

Or you can buy the house for 1.2m if you have 240k cash for a down deposit + 20k closing costs, good credit, low/no debts and 200k/year income to qualify for 960k mortgage. Then you just have to worry about making $4450/month mortgage payments for 30 years + 5k/year property tax, home insurance, and make sure you put away another 15k for repairs because the home is 25 years old (or $50k because you have to make blind bids without inspections to even have a chance of actually buying). Then you can take the risk of rate increases, housing bubble collapse and most pleasant of all, allow strangers to live in your house - but if you don't choose the right ones, there is nothing you can do for at least 4 months to get rid of them, while they can choose to not pay rent & cost $1000s in damages.

Unless you're handcuffed to a street light, I don't believe you ""can't"" move. Whole families manage to move half-way across the world with little more than the clothes on their backs every day. It's not pleasant, not convenient, but it's also not an impossibility. You can take a bus, you can hitch a ride, you can freaking walk. If you wanted to, you'd figure out a way to do it.

">Comparing units is not always helpful as everyone uses electricity differently!

&#x200B;

I disagree. If for example, her neighbours are family/multiple occupancy homes, they'll have games consoles, computers and TVs going in every room, more baths and showers being run, more laundry to wash, more dishes to clean, more food to cook and will likely be much less conservative with the heating.  They should absolutely have higher bills than a single woman living fairly frugally.

If their bills *are* significantly cheaper, it indicates a problem with her unit specifically. 

If everyone has similarly high bills, then it's more likely as you say related to the build quality and the heating source, as all the units were built the same way.

"The OP used the term detector for both devices, but the part of the system that legally requires yearly verification, the ‚Äòbuzzer‚Äô is never referred to as a detector, it can only alarm.  I was communicating with the OP in their language to establish that a strange man didn‚Äôt walk into her room and pretend to be a fire alarm verification technician by only testing the one on the ceiling, which would suggest false representation, and indicate a serious security risk

Confusion is understandable because there are differences between terminology between American and Canadian distributors, manufactures, and historical and social usage.  You will see detectors sold as alarms, and I too will call them alarms when differentiating between them and the common area detectors in the building.  But you won‚Äôt see the ‚Äôbuzzer‚Äô called a detector; it is part of the notification side of the building fire alarm system and can only notify of a building alarm; it cannot detect a problem.  Calling the ceiling mounted devices detectors is useful when talking with people residing in suites to differentiate between the two very separate systems since the buzzer cannot be called a detector, only alarm, but the ceiling mounted device can be called both a detector and alarm.",t2_93gdwlv,ebow951,0,1648731328.0,0,t1_i2ubaq9,i2ubaq9,False,bored-andignored,t3_tsnfhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tsnfhf/breach_of_bc_tenancy_agreement/,Breach of BC Tenancy Agreement?,/r/kelowna/comments/tsnfhf/breach_of_bc_tenancy_agreement/i2ubaq9/,1,r/kelowna,0,1

"My building manager is what you‚Äôd call spacey‚Ä¶ yet she still lets me know at least a few hours prior if not the night before. I know 24hrs is the required notice however my partner and I both work Monday-Friday same hours and the manager is aware of that. We‚Äôre clean people and don‚Äôt really care especially when it‚Äôs a known concern of ours. The only times she‚Äôs really had less than 24hrs notice was for our own ‚Äúemergency‚Äù issues or requests. 

My previous landlord was diligent about the 24hrs notice as it could become a huge issue. And she was actually ‚Äúfamily‚Äù to me. I‚Äôve moved to BC a few years ago and nannied for her nieces, the entire family practically adopted me as their own yet she still went out of the way to ensure I had 24hrs notice. She even rescheduled appointments if needed. And that also applied to exterior work where no one even needed access inside. 

As others have mentioned, absolutely report this and document it. Hopefully it won‚Äôt happen again, but this was an absolute invasion of privacy and I would not let this one slide lightly. If you do not show your concern over this, it could easily be misinterpreted as ‚Äòokay‚Äô and they may do it again, even if it‚Äôs accidental.

"Are you sure it was the smoke detectors, or was it the building fire alarm system?  Smoke detectors are the localized noise makers typically in the ceiling space that go off when you burn something in the kitchen, but not in your neighbour‚Äôs house.  The smoke alarm is the buzzer typically on the wall that sounds when the entire building sounds.  It‚Äôs part of the fire alarm system.

Smoke detectors should be tested monthly by the home owner or tenant, and replaced every ten years.  They do not require servicing.  If he was testing the detectors I would be very concerned.

Usually you would know if it‚Äôs the fire alarm system because during testing all the horns and buzzers in the building sound intermittently during verification.  I would have expected you to have heard the alarm sounding and evacuated the building if you didn‚Äôt know it was a test, which also raises a flag for me.

The fire alarm system is required to be verified yearly, and these appointments are often booked over a month in advance by the building management.  They will typically send out notices to building owners, or renters in the case of an apartment, and will usually post signs through the building. If you are renting from a suite owner, it‚Äôs possible the owner failed to communicate this event to you.  If you are renting from the building owner, you should have received advanced notice directly.

Many locks in apartment buildings and condos are designed to have one generic master key.  It‚Äôs possible that the technician, if working on the fire alarm system, was given the master key by management and was informed that residents were given proper notice.

This might not make you feel better, but I hope it offers insight.",t2_93gdwlv,ebow951,0,1648690036.0,0,t1_i2sjfg6,i2sjfg6,True,bored-andignored,t3_tsnfhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tsnfhf/breach_of_bc_tenancy_agreement/,Breach of BC Tenancy Agreement?,/r/kelowna/comments/tsnfhf/breach_of_bc_tenancy_agreement/i2sjfg6/,8,r/kelowna,0,8

"Knox is surrounded by residential and has huge volumes of pedestrian traffic on the trails - there is realistically nothing at all you need to worry about.

Ive been hiking it regularly for years, even going on the smaller side trails and I haven‚Äôt even seen anything on that trail that was remotely dangerous.

If there was a bear or cougar that close to town you‚Äôd hear about it and even if it somehow snuck in there, they‚Äôd likely leave due to all the people and noise.

And in the absolutely insane case that they weren‚Äôt scared away and they hadn‚Äôt been sighted yet - odds are you‚Äôd have a biker yell at you on his way past and say there is a bear/cougar in that direction and you‚Äôd probably turn around and join the giant pile of probably hundreds of people leaving the mountain‚Ä¶ no animal would go near that.

Edit: just as a note in general since it sounds like your new to the area - cougar sightings are generally reported very loudly in the local news. Most of then result in nothing exciting, but its generally a good idea to avoid those areas especially if the news story isn‚Äôt about them being relocated away from Kelowna.

"All in all some very good advise here. With regard to pomme fruit:

>Trees like apple and pear absolutely MUST be sprayed for codling moth. 
. . .
>Consumer grade sprays are nowhere near as effective as commercial sprays but are far less dangerous. 

Which means, essentially, that there's little to be done about the moths since homeowners are not allowed to use commercial sprays. On a new tree you can use something like tanglefoot but on an old one, with the bark so open, there's no chance all the little buggers  will be caught so you'll end up with a crop with lots of worms.

If you find your trees produce way too many apples or pears than you can use, consider hitting them with a hose when they start flowering to knock them off.  Or, as I do, turn the fruit into hard cider.

Edit: With regard to the apricot - Apricots flower very early and there's a possibility pollinators might not be out at that time so to get some fruit I've had to hand pollinate.",t2_qjl6eid,alleralapeche,0,1648571671.0,0,t1_i2kzwo5,i2kzwo5,False,middle-aged-tired,t3_tqjkwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tqjkwy/fruit_and_garden/,Fruit and Garden,/r/kelowna/comments/tqjkwy/fruit_and_garden/i2kzwo5/,2,r/kelowna,0,2

"Grab a book on fruit tree pruning for starters. There are many that will explain the theory (for example cherries fruit on last year's buds).

Trees like apple and pear absolutely MUST be sprayed for codling moth. The rest should be sprayed for the appropriate pests that you encounter. Aphids for example are easily controlled with something like Safers soap. You can get away with a generic spray like Wilson's fruit tree spray for most applications. Timing is key but a garden centre can help you. Generally don't spray when there are flowers because you will kill the pollinators. Spray as soon as the fruit sets and starts to take shape and then periodically afterwards according to the instructions for the spray. Read the directions and ask lots of questions from others in your area. Grapes generally require very little attention other than vigorous pruning to encourage fruiting. They are susceptible to a mildew especially if left wet. Opening up the plant to allow good air circulation helps.with this.

Honestly fruit trees in the Okanagan are nice to have but they are a pain in the butt. Consumer grade sprays are nowhere near as effective as commercial sprays but are far less dangerous. Look at the orchards around you and try to learn from how they are pruning their trees (of the same species). Keep in mind they are pruning for maximum production and you are likely pruning more for aesthetic reasons.

Good luck. Other than pruning drastically wrong, most mistakes you make are not serious in the long term.",t2_13y2d9,APLJaKaT,0,1648504450.0,0,t1_i2hoqfc,i2hoqfc,True,middle-aged-tired,t3_tqjkwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tqjkwy/fruit_and_garden/,Fruit and Garden,/r/kelowna/comments/tqjkwy/fruit_and_garden/i2hoqfc/,7,r/kelowna,0,7

"Just a heads up,  I moved 2 years ago from Alberta.  Decided to rent to find the right place.  It took a month of going to rental showings every day after work and finally winning one a few days before moving the family out.  Told by a property manager at least 70 people apply for a place now.  We are in a 1000 sq ft house.  It‚Äôs pricey to us but could add another $1000 easily now.  So it could rent for $3500 a month.  We will move back to Alberta if we lose this place.

We tried to buy a place but priced out now.  

We absolutely love it here but need a minimum of clearing $100,000 after taxes to make it worth renting for us.  Which I think our two incomes clear 99, 000 after taxes. Excluding rrsp plan with company.

May sound like a lot to a few but we are on a tight budget with that.  If we do absolutely nothing.  Cancelled our two streaming services and never ate out.  Never drove but work, We could maybe save $20 000 a year. 

That‚Äôs what my wife makes.  If she loses her job we are back to my income and it just breaks even.

And that‚Äôs only because I have a work vehicle provided.  

If I lost that that money is wiped out.  Pretty quick.

Everything is more expensive here.  If you can afford to buy an $800,000 dollar home easy then I would try.  If you can‚Äôt you will need a secondary income or you will always feel squeezed.

I was born in the Okanagan and wanted to bring my kids here for their early lives.  Now I think it‚Äôs been ruined on some levels.  Never thought Alberta would be appealing to me again.

Moving from a lcol area to hcol area is not the best.  We did it because we love it here.  Even we realize there is a point it may not be worth it. 

We know quite a few couples who moved in the last year.  They are all struggling.  Sadley it‚Äôs basically for the rich now.  Seeing lifers I knew leave not because of price but because the area is worse.  It‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs charm.  Really after the last few years I think the world lost its optimism.

"As someone whose family moved to Kelowna when I was young from Calgary here‚Äôs the comparison:
- Excellent schools in comparison to Alberta. Kids have access to a huge variety of programs regardless of family income at most schools. Some high schools specialize in certain areas and the schools in the city do a very good job at setting up kids for success regardless of whether they‚Äôre on the university track or if they want to go into trades. 
- Kelowna has amazing weather. Dry and hot in the summer with a very sunny spring as well. Potentially a little greyer in the winter than parts of Alberta, but much milder. It does get snow though, and if you like winter sports, there‚Äôs multiple resorts within an hour‚Äôs or so drive of town. 
- Housing is the major downside that will make or break whether or not Kelowna is for you. The housing market is crazy. If you don‚Äôt already own/have enough for a down payment, you will struggle to save and put down roots if that 75K is a single income. 
- Kelowna is also a city that requires a vehicle to live easily. Transit bypasses large parts of the city completely and it doesn‚Äôt run frequently compared to a city like Calgary or Edmonton. 
- Note: It‚Äôs not a very diverse city. This may not affect you, but it was a bit challenging growing up here as someone who wasn‚Äôt white. The region is also more on the conservative and religious side, but not moreso than Alberta, just in comparison to the major cities in B.C. 

On all other metrics, even though the city has had increasing issues with property crime and violent incidents (some gang related, some related to the opioid and housing crises), it‚Äôs still overall a great place for families in comparison with major cities in Canada.

"It's not a high enough wage for even the locals here that don't already own. I would not move here with that kind of money promise. A 1 bedroom is 1600 to 1800 + utilities and ugly/small. You have to battle for applications against other renters. And I do mean battle - most lanlords don't want kids or don't want pets or don't want ..ect list goes on....Bidding wars on purchased homes is a problem - people are bidding 60 to 150k over asking with no inspection and sales move fast. A lot of newly developed homes are on leased land here too - leased land is 400-600 extra a month in some cases and our strata fees are hefty here too on condos/townhomes. Just keep that in mind.

We also are having more and more issues with homeless activity and drugs - watch your step in the spring at the beaches, there is always one or two people a summer that gets stuck with a needle. Lock your stuff up, theft is common here. It looks like a small place but it's got a lot of crime.

If you have the money you can enjoy things here. Ski hills, wineries, fancy restaurants, boating. If you don't have money there are the beaches - and hikes. Get fire insurance on your rv's/motorbikes before summer hits...so many people are not prepared and then get mad when they can't get insurance at the time of evacuation. If you have asthma, this might be a hard place to live because our summers have been frequented with heavy smoke over the last 5 years.

Our bus system is bad here. Really bad. You can't rely on public transit here very much. Gas prices are normally 1.50 in the summer - I don't know what it will be like this summer tho. Remember we pay 2 taxes on most items you buy..say goodbye to costco booze - we don't have that here.

Honestly, this town is a shithole - if you are rich it's awesome, if you already have a home that you bought before 2008 you can have a very nice life on 70k with a family..

[https://kelownabikerentals.ca/bike-fleet/](https://kelownabikerentals.ca/bike-fleet/) offers a range of adaptive options that suit those with limited mobility or stamina. I'd recommend the recumbent trike if you're looking for e-assist.

"Yes and no, Its alot more expensive for housing/taxes here. Renting is a nightmare if you're not buying, and if you're buying expect to go over asking price. But overall, besides a bit of downtown, I would consider it pretty safe.

The winter is cloudy, every single day for 4 months, mininal snow most of the time, still above 0‚Å∞ most days all winter. So it's a trade off of sunlight for warmth.

It depends on the job really. 75K is enough to live on pretty easily.",t2_efvmiw1n,-Vybz,0,1648428868.0,0,t1_i2dqlmt,i2dqlmt,True,oli686,t3_tpwmzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tpwmzf/should_i_move/,Should I move?,/r/kelowna/comments/tpwmzf/should_i_move/i2dqlmt/,8,r/kelowna,0,8

"We moved here from the lower mainland and my kid was born here 9 years ago, plenty to do for families.

Winter here is easy, really only lasts from late November to late February. (My view might be considered biased since I also bike all year long)

If you're a single income family that might be on the low side but quite doable here. Figure out your budget, years ago I remember seeing that living here required a little over $60k for a family of four but I don't know if that has changed since then.",t2_1uzv664d,captain-geek,0,1648428081.0,0,t1_i2doz7o,i2doz7o,True,oli686,t3_tpwmzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/kelowna/comments/tpwmzf/should_i_move/,Should I move?,/r/kelowna/comments/tpwmzf/should_i_move/i2doz7o/,13,r/kelowna,0,13
