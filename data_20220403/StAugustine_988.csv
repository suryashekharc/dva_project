"You didn't say where in town you are staying, so some playground options all over the place. Our three favorite playgrounds in St Augustine are Palencia Park (north of town on US1), Eddie Vickers Park (just south of downtown on Riberia), and Treaty Park (south of town, on Wildwood between US 1 and 207. 

If you are going up to Palencia, Fort Mose (pronounce Mo-say) is a good place to get out and run around and has some interesting history. 

Of all the downtown stuff, our kids love the Castillo and Lightner museum the most. The Lightner museum is just a random collection of stuff, there are a couple sections with lots of breakables, but also a stuffed lion and a mummy. Also walking up and down St George street and checking out the shops. Not as much there unique to St Augustine, but a good way to pass the time and keep them moving. There is half a playground to the west of the parking garage. When the whole things was open that was on our list of favorite playgrounds, but it hasn't been maintained and they closed most of it off to the kids. We wouldn't go out of our way to visit it anymore, but if you are already at the visitor's center you may as well go.

The Alligator Farm is a gem, we can highly recommend it. Also, Guana River has a great little visitor's center (small fee) and great outdoor activities (second Saturday of every month is family seining, the kids get to drag a net through the lake and learn about the stuff they pull up). Fort Matanzas is south of town, our kids love the ferry ride (free) as much as anything else on this list, and there is a nice nature walk as well.

There are three mini golf options- Adventure Landing, Anastasia minigolf (just over the bridge from downtown), and Fiesta Falls (a little further south on A1A Beach Blvd). Our kids liked Adventure Landing the least. There is also a itty bitty putt putt place right downtown (on the south side of the bridge), but it is old school and looked boring so our kids didn't even try it.

A whole host of beach options, from north to south:  
North Beach Park has a playground away from the beach and showers  
Surfside Park has showers  
Vilano Beach has showers  
Anastasia State Park has showers  
St Augustine Pier has showers and a pier ($2 to walk out on the pier, higher prices for fishing)  
Ocean Hammock doesn't have showers (very important to our family :) but it doesn't have a really cool hike through the hammock to the beach  
Butler Beach has showers (we see more tortoises and rabbits on the walk over here than anywhere else)  
Crescent Beach has showers  
Matanzas Beach doesn't have showers, but is a nice place to visit before or after Fort Matanzas  
Matanzas Inlet doesn't have showers, but is also a nice place to visit before or after Fort Matanzas. This is on the intercoastal side, so no waves, sometimes the kids like this better.

If you are willing to drive further south, Washington Oaks has some pleasant botanical gardens, but even better is going to the beach at Washington Oaks and then walking a half mile north to the rocky section. The kids will love playing on the rocks and exploring all the wild shapes and nooks and crannies. Go at high tide and again at low tide for two completely different experiences. Great place to see fish and crabs.

If you want a really great playground, Jame F Holland Park in Palm Coast is a place our kids will ask for on special occasions. Palm Coast actually has a bunch of really great park options. I think three of our top ten favorite parks are actually down there instead of up here. But it is a drive, you have to make a day of it (also that is where the Golden Corral is).

Every new subdivision has some sort of playground equipment, when the kids are bored we'll take them someplace they've never been before and the novelty makes up for the limited playground equipment.",t2_6n6cd,philnotfil,0,1649001530.0,0,t1_i38ibhr,i38ibhr,True,ReydanDeathrain,t3_tur65a,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/tur65a/visiting_with_young_kids/,Visiting with young Kids,/r/StAugustine/comments/tur65a/visiting_with_young_kids/i38ibhr/,2,r/StAugustine,0,2

"Technically, every school in SJC is part of the same district, so there are no district restrictions, but we do have zoning based on location. Some zones have more schools than others, and some schools are better funded and taken care of than others. Students can be sent to any school in the district, if the transfer is made by the district they get what’s called a “zoning waiver” for transportation but if the family chooses to send a student out of zone they have to provide all transportation for the student. Every HS in SJC also offers different “academies” and specialty programs, so student are often encouraged to attend an out of zone high school if they want to attend a certain academy, but again have to provide their own transportation if they choose to go out of zone. So really, only families that have the ability to transport back and forth to school every day are able to go out of zone.

"I think they mean My Cauldron Too. It's worth a look, but for your actual question, no. St. Augustine is well-steeped in good ole boy governance, simple minds, and vestiges of Catholicism. Unfortunately, no healthy groups have been able to stay here that I've ever noticed or found. There is a UU church on the island that might be at least an avenue to getting somewhere, but it's all solitary work here. I've heard you can't swing a cat in Jacksonville without hitting a Gardnerian, but I personally doubt that highly. As far as I'm aware, the closest OTO group is in Orlando.  


I remember in the late 90's, walking through our Ripley's location to get a friend for their lunch break & in the downstairs lobby they had a human hair bracelet once owned by Gerald Gardner in a display case.

"Is this what you were talking about? Had to look through the responses, must have missed this one when you posted it. Therefore I apologize for my response to your second reply, I had missed this one. u/The_Spindrifter illustrated the numbers and economics between a need for unions and strikes fairly well in his responses to you. 

Now, if you actually want to discuss in good faith and actually look at  information from the opposite side, I'd be happy to show you the documented research I have conducted on the poverty wages the majority of Saint Augustine businesses are paying their employees, and how they aren't worth it, especially with the rise in gas prices and inflation of general goods. I can even list specific businesses that have been paying less than minimum wage to their employees who had to be informed that the minimum was no longer $9.25 by outside sources. In turn, I would be happy to see any facts and information you have that supports your perspective. 

The business owners and managers have shown no indicators of being willing to change on their own, especially the smaller businesses. Due to this, they are likely to lose everything, as bigger businesses will ultimately end up treating their employees better in order to actually have employees in a declining labor market. If they don't change, they will lose, and with them Saint Augustine will lose the private enterprise and charming local businesses that give it its unique atmosphere in favor of corporate abominations like Cinnabon of all places.

"No, it's just that if you are all of these things and ""have so much"", what the hell are you doing here? Seems like everything you own isn't making you happy at all, and worse you still turn a blind eye to the fact that you were exploited as child labor and your daughter is by your own admission being exploited as child labor. Meanwhile you are insulting people online who only want a reasonable wage compared to the wealth that they help generate for others. Who could have a problem with that? Hmmm....

You have all this wealth and businesses and say that you built it allll on your own but instead of either being out & about enjoying it, or enjoying it with your family, or actually you know, *working,* you are here bitching because a lot of the rest of us who worked equally long and hard and with more skills than you have, have nothing to show for it now of no fault of our own, and it also makes us highly suspicious of those who seem to have an awful lot and have very little work to show for it and are bragging about it here and yet turn a blind eye to how we have been slighted... makes one wonder why you blame us instead of wanting us to have it all jut like you, and we did work to earn it just like you allegedly did. We worked harder AND smarter and for our efforts saw real word wages fall while our productivity rose (cited by me earlier), watched corporations raise the prices of goods and services to achieve record profits wile cutting back on employees and cutting the benefits and pay of the remaining employees (also cited), and instead of being happy for us fighting back to take back what we should be rightfully getting--a fraction of what you claim to have--you're here dissing us for trying to correct an unjust inequity that keeps us from being equals for our efforts.

You seem highly sus. If you're telling the truth and you're that blind to what is going on around you it makes you look like an uncaring asshole. If you're lying then you're actually just like the rest of us and spouting BS and are to be pitied and ignored. If you're telling the truth and just being a dick about all of the rest of us fighting for what is our rightful slice of the American Pie of which you seem to have so much, it suggests that you might have a reason to be afraid, as if maybe you didn't actually earn it and your wealth was built on the backs of poorly compensated labor from which you reaped their reward and they gained nothing of real value in return, and you are worried about people wanting to level the scales and that means that maybe you might have to give back that which never really should have been yours in the first place. Maybe. Time will tell, but your total obsession with possessions and lack of concern about child welfare and exploitation is pretty telling and a sad tale at that. Go be an asshole somewhere else and let the rest of us take back what was always rightfully ours in the first place. 

Let me guess: if you are legit, you are one of those batshit crazy ""We're a family"" type employers that thinks they can get away with behaving like Thomas Edison in the 21st Century and do whatever you want and get away with paying the people who actually put you where you are the bare minimum because it's a ""privilege"" to ""work for \[you\]"" and they ""should be grateful"". Yeah that's going to come back to haunt you some day.

Me? I ""Went Galt"". The corporations of Florida don't want to pay  fair wage so I exited their system and made my own home businesses and it's good enough for now, but if I ever do go back to the corporate world I will expect that I will be *fairly* compensated for my labor, extensive experience and education that I bring to the table, and anything less than that is not acceptable. Meanwhile I am watching millions of my fellow Americans getting the shaft and why should I be mad at them for fighting back for their fair share?

The Democrats voted to give taxpayers back some of their hard earned money and expanded unemployment to try and help the millions of Americans that were laid off from their jobs without just cause by corporations that had and still are making *record profits.* It worked.

Yes, actually the Democrats do love the middle class, their typical voter in non-southern states. So why is it that the majority of the Red states are sucking hind tit and have the highest poverty? Is it because red states are less educated and therefore can't make a living worthy by your decree of worth, or is it because the poverty is systemic, endemic, and deliberately imposed by the ""leadership"" of said states? Either way, life under Republican rule leads to poverty. On the above map the only reason Texass is wealthy is because of the oil money, but one only need to visit there to see the huge discrepancy between who do and do not have that wealth. Hint: it's not the middle class, and that's a Republican stronghold. The only reason Virginia has money is because of Washington DC: take away DC and the money would follow it right out. Sterling, Virginia only has money because of the local wealth attracted by power from DC being right next door.

"\*can be.

You cited one well known example while ignoring the context and known history of the following quote: ""Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.""

Have I seen abuses in the Unions? Yes, I absolutely have, and yet I still join them whenever offered. Why? Checks and balances for one, and to *undo the corruption* for another. The only way to change an institution is from the inside. Unions are just as problematic as the vile corporate overlords, but they are a necessary evil in some cases or just plain necessary in most where they have popped up. Why? because the people were forced to take a stand to protect themselves and empower themselves at points in time where others with power sought to increase theirs at the expense of others.

The corruption of Corporatism that is destroying America is the force that continues to make Unions necessary as a ways and means of protecting the workers.

Do you like being able to actually use the restroom while at work? Thank a union: the CWA had to fight for the right of AT&T employees to actually be able to *take a piss* on company time. Do you like lunch breaks? Thank a Union. Do you like the 40 hour work week and days off? Thank the Unions. Do you like paid medical benefits, dental, 401K, et cetera? UNIONS MADE THAT HAPPEN.

"You don't seem to understand what a minimum wage really is: it's not the line the government draws in the sand, it's the amount, the bare amount, that a human needs to earn to survive *and somewhat thrive* while paying the bills. Honestly at this point I'm not even sure that $21 an hour is enough anymore with the current rate of inflation, but I cannot imagine anyone being able to afford working for less than that with rent at nearly $2,000 for an 800 sq ft apartment, groceries at outrageous levels, FPL and JEA jacking up rates and suppressing solar self-sufficiency, and all of this was before the Putin war gave the oil companies a pathetic excuse to jack up the price of gasoline to near Bush-era levels when they are simultaneously posting record profits.

""While the question of whether FDR meant for the minimum wage to serve as a ""living wage"" at the inception of the federal minimum wage can be reasonably answered, that does not resolve the debate over how the minimum wage should be applied today.

First, the very definition of what constitutes ""decent living"" supported by a ""living wage"" comes into question. Certainly, today's standard of living in the United States differs from that of the early post-depression era with all the modern comforts that a near-century of progress has brought about. What's more, in FDR's 1933 speech cited above, and other speeches given around that time, the context shows that his call for ""living wages"" is specifically put forward as a contrast to what he calls ""starvation wages.""

In full context, he says,

    In my Inaugural, I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By ""business"" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages, I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living. Throughout industry, the change from starvation wages and starvation employment to living wages and sustained employment can, in large part, be made by an industrial covenant to which all employers shall subscribe. [emphasis added]

The context demonstrates that his description of ""living wages"" and ""decent living"" is only that which rises above starvation and ""bare subsistence."" ""

"So how'd that work out for you under GDW Bush? The prices were higher under Bush for a considerable stretch, and your boy Drumpf was a Putin fellator and conspirator and Putin started this little kerfuffle that has allegedly caused the prices to rise, except for the whole part where it is solely the petrol companies jacking up the prices arbitrarily before the market even has time to be impacted.

There have been more job gains under Biden but that gets reported as ""sluggish"" somehow even when Drumpf's numbers were worse but got reported as ""strong"". You say very few laws should exist but the Republican'ts break as many laws as they can on a regular basis making them the Men of Lawlessness, especially the whole part where they tried to overthrow an ordinary democratic election on their own soil that they lost fairly, and then organized a treasonous raid on the Capitol and tried to assassinate the sitting Vice President and a State governor.

The only reason your kind want ""less laws"" is so you can be evil without responsibility or consequences, just like your spiritual father Satan. Biden hasn't done a single authoritarian thing: not one person ever went to jail for being a dickhead and not wearing masks in public during a lethal pandemic that killed 900,000 Americans and millions more worldwide, and the sad truth is that every single person who took part in that scumbaggery should be charged with manslaughter and sent to prison for life.

In short, corporations are lying \*and\* *screwing the American people every way that they can*. Some of the most profitable corporations in America are the ones least willing to pay their employees what they are worth and go out of their way to avoid giving real raises, health benefits, or anything even remotely approaching the profit sharing plans of the 1980s. 

American workers young and old are tired of getting their throats cut at home and at work over goddamned corporate greed, and that is why more and more young Americans are practically being pushed towards Socialist and possibly even Communist attitudes. Dear Republicoonts: you only have yourselves to blame when the revolution comes and you wind up being the first ones up against the wall for dispatch.

"Allow me to explain the issue to you:

At the moment minimum wage in Florida is $10.00 per hour. The businesses in Saint Augustine take patriotic pride (with some laudable exceptions) in not paying their employees more than absolute minimum. They also decline to employ these workers for more than 30 hour work weeks, because they'd have to provide insurance if they did. So each of these jobs provides less than $300 per week, $1,200 a month, or $14,400 a year. 

Now you seem like the type that says, ""Well, they should get a second job or a better job."" All right, well, they can do that and work 60 hours a week for $28,800 a year. A better job isn't an option for everyone. Rents are easily $1,100-$1,500 depending on the part of the county for a 1 bedroom/1 bath. At minimum, one retail worker's entire job is enough to pay rent. The other job's income would vanish into increasing groceries, gas, and utilities. 

Even if our hypothetical person saved enough for a down payment (unlikely), currently the cheapest, crappiest houses are still in the $180,000 range. The end result is still going to being more monthly than rent at the rate prices are increasing.

So, my point? Where are the people who make St. Augustine a place to enjoy by working at the bars and attractions going to live? The county recently did a study that stated 64% of the workers in St. John's County can't afford to live here. The number is probably higher. Unless you're intending on working in retail with your spouse and three children, you're not helping. In fact, you're hurting as another consumer that provides nothing.",t2_y58ts,EQandCivfanatic,0,1646926492.0,0,t1_i047xno,i047xno,False,OTM0DTE,t3_tal2f8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/tal2f8/young_family_moving_to_st_augustine/,Young family moving to St. Augustine,/r/StAugustine/comments/tal2f8/young_family_moving_to_st_augustine/i047xno/,3,r/StAugustine,0,3

"If you like fried shrimp and don’t go to osteens you mega fucked up. Osteens is my go to recommendation for anyone visiting st. Augustine. They have been open over 50 years for a reason. theres always a 2 hour wait and getting there before open isn’t a fix because there’s still gonna be a line. so here are some best practices:

They are CASH ONLY. They are so good they don’t have to fuck with credit card merchant fees. 

They are closed Sunday and Monday. 

They have an atm on site but it charges a fee. 

If you don’t want to eat in the restaurant call ahead for pickup at the window and food will be ready usually in 15 min. You’ll want to be there when it’s ready so it’s fresh and not soggy. Eat it in your car OR I’ve seen many people take their to go boxes to the British pub which is like 2 doors down so they can drink and eat and play darts. 

If you want to wait you can go antiquing at the store next door and their PA system feeds into the antique store so you’ll know when your table is ready

If you want to eat in the restaurant and drink and play darts while you wait tell the lady at the window you’ll be at the British pub and she will call the bartender when your table is ready. 

I think they put up an outdoor tent and tables for covid so you might be able to sit out back and eat too. 

It’s a lot of food and you may want to take a nap after eating so don’t plan anything huge right after or just save osteens for dinner.

St. John’s’ county in general is the #1 school district in the state, so regardless of where in the county, you will be good. But north side of the county like Nocatee definitely has among the best schools here. They’re a big reason why we have that ranking of best school district.

Homes off of 207 and 210 are still decently priced. I’d also recommend taking a look at the St. Augustine Shores/South area as well.

Depending on your price point, The Ponte Vedra area also has very attractive, particularly Nocatee, neighborhoods for young families.

"Well, we have a metric ass-ton of new construction going on if you're willing to wait a little while; try to understand that as it is, so many people have moved here already that there are waiting lists for apartments and they are cutting down trees and filling in swamps as fast as those \*&\^%$#@! developers can (with no impact fees because DeathSatanis wouldn't want to slow down the destruction of Florida for profit!!) so look forward to that nice sales tax increase we have coming in November to pay for all of this expansion since DeathSatanis made impact fees a no-no.

Anyway, you're just going to have to get a good Realtor to try and help you out, but if you want a good laugh: 400 sq foot ramshackle shacks are currently selling for $300,000. - $400K for anywhere near downtown. There is another 120 year old, @ 350 sq ft shack currently being renovated around the corner from me and I fully expect it to sell for that same price. No, I am not kidding.

If you want pre-built try up around Bayard on over to the river, ghost light road and whatnot on over to Switzerland (the ""town"" of) and into Fruit Cove on down along 13. Look this isn't me trying to be an ass, there literally isn't much open real estate left in St. Johns that hasn't been priced into the stratosphere; like the other Yankee said, check the websites for ratings to see what schools appeals most to you but I have to warn you: the best schools in Florida are still 1 year behind the worst schools in NY. The education standards in Florida are *atrocious* and always have been, but they got worse after the 1980s. You're better off trying to get your kids into a private school and even that might be problematic now.

"if you like Asian food, I would always recommend @ corner sushi or Baitong.

Mojo’s Tacos is inexpensive and delicious, hands down the best Taco place in town. Super delicious, classic, amazing Tex-Mex.

Mojo’s Barbecue can get somewhat crowded, but is totally worth. Not a bad thing on the menu. Also, they have the best Macaroni and Cheese in St. Augustine.

The Floridian is SUPER chill, all in all a great atmosphere, and not usually packed with people. The food is top notch, and they can make practically anything on their menu gluten free.

Baitong is great for those who enjoy Thai food, and they serve sushi too. Menu items are superb, and the staff is friendly.

@ Corner Sushi is the best sushi restaurant, and even picky eaters can find something on the menu that they love. I specifically am fond of the JB roll, and the chicken fried rice. My parents have said that also give… *generous* pours if you’re into wine. 

Gypsy Cab is wonderful (though it can get kinda expensive) and I recommend you stop there if just to try their chocolate peanut butter pie.

"I grew up here in St. Augustine. If you're looking for local businesses and not chains that can hit that spot I have some suggestions.

St. Augustine beach: Stir it up (hippie lunch vibe right on the beach with amazing smoothies), Beachside Diner (great breakfast spot on the beach, but can be busy)

Downtown St. Augustine: Blue hen (amazing breakfast but very hard to get a seat) Uptown Swinery (new swanky place that has great ambiance and good food) CRAVE (best lunch in town according to my wife)

Vilano: Caps (obviously a must, it hits all the spots) Aunt Kates (Cheaper knock off of caps, but with the same view and the food is still good) Beaches (kinda kitchy but can be fun at night with the outside bar)

St. Augustine Night life: Sangrias (a bar with a wrap around 2nd story deck to people watch while drinking from an extensive sangria menu) Stogies (Cigar bar that often has live jazz bands and a very cozy feel, my favorite) Boatdrinks (Small little bar with fun drinks) Tini Martini (always packed but serves the best martinis, know for their godiva chocolate martini) Prohibition Kitchen (Hip place that has an alcoholic milkshake bar, can be very loud)

Honorable mention, personal favs: Cousteau's waffle and milkshake bar (named after the movie life aquatic, share a unique ice cream sundae on top of a hot waffle) Food Truck landing (or English Landing Marina, just a food truck lot if you are strap for time but want some fun) If you make it south near marineland, check out Bings Landing (Captains, a bbq joint where the owner used to work at a cheescake factory. two awesome worlds colliding)",t2_88brlop8,Gatibo22,0,1646857584.0,0,t1_i00m5ye,i00m5ye,True,kiggles7,t3_tabxt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/tabxt7/hidden_gems_for_meals_here/,Hidden gems for meals here,/r/StAugustine/comments/tabxt7/hidden_gems_for_meals_here/i00m5ye/,4,r/StAugustine,0,4

Trust me, me and my fam have done this multiple times. we have even walked down before a hurricane!

"Welcome back, nerds!

How long has it been?  There's been some new arrivals (River and Fort).  And some old fav's lost (Mi Casa replaced with a *fucking Cinnabon/Auntie Annies.*..)

On to Nature:  Put Washington Oaks on the list.  There's also a great BBQ place down there called Captains, which is my favorite in the region (suck it Mojo).  In that neighborhood is a smaller fort you may not know about, Ft. Matanzas.   About 35 miles inland is The Ravines, which is nice.  If you're interested in getting wet, Silver Glenn or Salt Springs maybe, but they're maybe an hour away.  Fountain of Youth is kind of nature, though less and less.  To close out the ""nature"" bit, there's a Pretzel/Crepe shop on St. George Street called Ben's Pretzels that has downtown's best garden, hidden in the back.

On to Things You're Open To:  Drunken Horse, Michaels Tasting Room for fine dining.  Tradewinds, St George tavern, maybe Stogies, and most of those Anastasia Island bars are dive bars.  On Wednesdays at Colonial Oak they have a free\* improv show, which is pretty good.  Don't know much about comic book stores, but the ""Man Shop"" at Hypolita/George is, you know, a store.  A1A down to Daytona is a wonderful drive (and Wash Oaks is along the way).  There's fish markets all over the place, but a butcher i really like is the Chop House on Anastasia.

..hold on, let me refill my rum...

Personally, Stogies is my fav bar, Boat Drinks is the best rum bar.  Uptown Swinery has some interesting bloody marys, and might be a good breakfast spot.  The Fort tour is cheap and interesting.  Old Town Trolly is a pretty good.  We're up to three distilleries now, the most famous is below the Ice Plant.  Fancy drinks can also be had at Prohibition Kitchen, but it's quite crowded.  Cousteau's is an unusual waffle place, themed after a Wes Anderson movie.   Aviles Street is kind of off the main path, and has some really interesting little spots.   Alligator Farm is probably worth a visit.  Caps on the Water in Vilano beach is where you want to go if you think you can beat the record of - what is it? - 27 Dozen oysters?  But it's a good place to go for a sunset.  Barley Republic will sell you a liter of Guinness.",t2_kqpbg,mainstreetmark,0,1646354068.0,0,t1_hz9732n,hz9732n,True,SPECPOL,t3_t6422g,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/t6422g/10th_anniversary_trip/,10th anniversary trip,/r/StAugustine/comments/t6422g/10th_anniversary_trip/hz9732n/,8,r/StAugustine,0,8

If you get a puppy be aware that they don't vaccinate them for kennel cough. As my two adult dogs at home never board or spend time with dogs outside the house it isn't needed to vaccinate them for it. Brought home a puppy from there and everyone was coughing and miserable for weeks.

"I still think they fill a need. My dog would have been put down for being aggressive but her aggression only arises from fear. She only will bite if you touch her in certain areas and she gives you clear telegraphs about it, but most county shelters can't spend time to work with them on that. So I think SAFE does fill a need but I don't think they have the resources they need to handle the amount of need they have to fill.

"Yes and no, depending on how you look at it.

So, they are a ""rescue mill"". They pull  as many pets as possible from kill shelters and try to get them adopted as quickly as possible. This can be a good thing.

The bad thing is a lot of the times these pets are in bad shape. Trauma, health conditions, so on and so forth. They are often deemed ""unadoptable"" by the kill shelters for these reasons and often need specific considerations when you adopt them and SAFE won't really tell you about them nor do they have the time or resources to treat them themselves.

Source: I adopted a dog from them and she was in terrible shape. Untreated yeast infections in both ears, horrible trauma from where she had come from (a puppy mill situation). I had to spend thousands and thousands of dollars of my own money to treat her physical issues and hundreds of hours training some of her worst trauma issues and to this day she still has some problems. She's better than she was, when I got her she was a complete mess and couldn't even be touched without peeing herself and she's much better now.

But you are getting the broken, the unadoptables, the ones nobody else will take.

"Local Realtor here with my two cents:

The short answer is yes. Though I would encourage you to look at the whole of St. John’s County as the schools here are #1 in the state.

I would say Anastasia, World Golf Village, 207 and 210 areas, St. Augustine Shores/South are all areas to consider.

Ponte Vedra is also a fantastic area to consider if you can afford it.

"**[Pittsburgh left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_left)** 
 
 >The Pittsburgh left is a colloquial term for the driving practice of the first left-turning vehicle taking precedence over vehicles going straight through an intersection, associated with the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area. In other locales, the practice is also referred to as a Boston left or New York left. It is a potentially illegal and controversial practice.

"It's not a NE thing, it's specifically a western Pennsylvania thing, colloquially known as the [Pittsburgh Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_left). 

When a traffic light turns green, if the first car in opposing traffic has their turn signal on, the custom is that you let them and only them through before proceeding. 

Pittsburgh's my home town, but I always forget about the Pittsburgh Left when I go back to visit which usually results in me getting flipped off and called a jagov, the local swear word.

There's lots of Pittsburgh ex-pats in Florida, so always remember. If you're sitting at a light, and the opposing car has their turn signal on, AND A STEELERS BUMPER STICKER WHICH THEY DEFINITELY WILL IF THEY'RE FROM PITTSBURGH, just let them through.",t2_7uh4aps5,ecstatic_cynic,0,1645227909.0,0,t1_hxiiaxj,hxiiaxj,True,pways15,t3_svqzuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/StAugustine/comments/svqzuz/turning_left_in_front_of_oncoming_traffic_a_north/,Turning left in front of oncoming traffic a North East thing?,/r/StAugustine/comments/svqzuz/turning_left_in_front_of_oncoming_traffic_a_north/hxiiaxj/,3,r/StAugustine,0,3

No one really knows anything about the individuals running and when it says, ""vote for 3"", the top three on the ballot win 97% of the time. The order for the ballot is by picking names out of a hat. 

Most people running for school board are unqualified. What does Joe the plumber know about how a school operates, or what it takes to run a classroom? Most who run do so because they have a personal agenda, an axe to grind or some sense of power to ""straighten something out.""

With that being said, information about true wack jobs, idiots and religious kooks should be widely shared.
