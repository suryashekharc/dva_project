"Call another walgreens, especially if you're trying to get a controlled med & talk to the pharmacist & explain. I'm sure they can tell you why that location is closed or shut down. I find it really hard to believe that parmacy in particular would be shut down bc its 24/7 & right by Wesley. So most patients go there to get their RX filled after visiting the ER. Hopefully if you get a understanding & cool pharmacist at a different walgreens location, they can transfer the RX for you. Sometimes its iffy that they will even do that depending on the medication. Typically with controlled prescriptions they wont even transfer those between pharmacies, even though its the exact same pharmacy company. But if its closed because of an issue on their end, & you need your med asap, the other pharmacist should be understanding & willing to accommodate you. I've had issues with Walgreens & getting my controlled meds for years now. I'd go to a different pharmacy, but it's the only pharmacy my particular insurance will allow me to use. I've tried a lot of the locations in town, & not one is any better than the other. They've billed me, well my ins company multiple times for medications I've never even picked up, They've gotten fill dates wrong to the point where I've physically had to record myself picking up my RX. I've even had issues getting the vaccine there. They were a mere seconds away from injecting both my husband & I with the wrong vaccine. They literally had both vials of vaccines pulled up with the needle at my arm, & thankfully I have a medical background & stopped & questioned them after looking at the syringe & what was written down vs what was about to be injected into me. üò≥ Don't even bother calling corporate offices, they  could care less.

"This type of thing is an example of how inflexible the government can be. It's really frustrating.  When I was a Pizza Hut driver in Delano I would often deliver to the jail, and sometimes especially during the day there are really no parking spaces in front, unless I park in a sherif deputy spot, so I just went into the garage a couple times.  Well it was $1.25 to get out, but the gate attendant was reasonable with me cause I was the pizza guy delivering food, well the 2nd time the attendant working that day couldn't care less who I was, $1.25 or I didn't leave.  I didn't have time to argue or go inside to get anything done about it.  I shouldn't have to walk a quarter mile to deliver their pizza because they can't accommodate someone they called and asked to deliver them food.  

There were two other times delivering to I think it was city hall or something.  The gated parking lot really was the only reasonable way to get access so I didn't have much choice.  After having my bad experience at the jail I asked the person I delivered to if there was anything I needed to do for the gate attendant to let me through and their response was something like ""no, no they'll just let you through"". Wrong! Again the gate attendant couldn't care less who I was or what I was there to do, they said I needed validated parking, lucky that gate was only like 65 cents instead of $1.25.  So the 2nd time I went there and called the person to let them know to come down and asked them to validate my parking ticket, but again, the attendant said they did something wrong and the validated parking was, well, invalid.  Again, no flexibly no care for anything other than, ""this is what they tell me to do so this is what I do"".  Maddening.

"If you can get fiber, that would be best. AT&T is the only company building it out in Wichita that I know of. Otherwise Cox is likely your best bet if you want reliable and fast internet. No ISP is perfect but if you need reliable internet for a business, it‚Äôs probably not in your best interest to do anything unique like Starlink. If you‚Äôre getting internet in a commercial building, you will likely have to buy a business plan but they may offer a residential plan if you ask. I‚Äôve used the Verizon and AT&T hotspots devices and iPhone hotspots on commercial plans for my job and they all have issues with occasionally dropping internet during the day, especially mid afternoon. 

If you‚Äôre a business that relies on internet, pay for good service. This is a cost of doing business that is necessary in 2022.

"I scored a 36 on the ACT. ACT prep books are a great investment as are prep courses. I attended a few in person prep courses and had an online course. I felt the online course was more effective since the classes in person usually go over basic information for the masses. If you are on a budget, you can usually find used ones on Craigslist or from seniors in at your school. Your school and local library should also have ones for sale. Like other people on this sub, I would advise daily practice. There are many apps that have free daily questions which help reinforce your learning. 

Once you are closer to your test date, practice taking a full exam several times as if it is the real thing with time limits. You can find full exams in practice books or online as PDFs.

"No, thank you. It's important to do deep-dive stuff like this instead of the Tweets and soundbites proclaiming a quickie diagnosis of problems.

I wish more people acknowledged the collateral damage to families around addicts. My best example is when I had my wisdom teeth removed, and my sibling stole my pain meds. When I told my parents, they ordered me not to report this to anyone at school (especially the principal or my sibling's coach) because my sibling would get in trouble. They told me they ""would talk to"" my sibling and asked me if I would be okay taking Tylenol. To make a long story short, I wasn't okay with Tylenol or their response to the situation. I wish I would have been in Al-Anon or Alateen...Like I said, my parents cared and genuinely did their best. In the end, though, I think it was emptying their wallet as much as anything else that ultimately kept my siblings from ending up like Tom.

What also grinds my gears is the woke response with the same endgame as my parents: ""There is nothing wrong with you. The person struggling here is your sibling. Because they can't help themselves, other people need to give up more and get used to being uncomfortable."" And don't even get me started on privilege.

By all means build more mental health facilities and hire more social workers. Teachers too, they are the ones dealing with more of this fallout than anyone else short of law enforcement.

Families are the first line of defense though, and we're kidding ourselves if another government programs is the answer for Tom...I am not a libertarian. Cutting taxes as a solution is laughable. Creating an environment where families can flourish ought to be the government response: higher wages, more statutory time off, and making Medicare and EBT free for all would be a great start.",t2_jweqxxb3,Anxious_Energy_9115,0,1648826364.0,0,t1_i2zrb5x,i2zrb5x,False,itsjustseth101,t3_ttq4py,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/ttq4py/meet_thomas_homeless_in_wichita_at_age_25_i_got_a/,"meet Thomas, homeless in Wichita at age 25, I got a chance to speak with him.",/r/wichita/comments/ttq4py/meet_thomas_homeless_in_wichita_at_age_25_i_got_a/i2zrb5x/,9,r/wichita,0,9

"Drugs are not cool.

It's staggering how many people can get caught up in something that drags your life down. My partner and I were just talking about how many people were affected by addiction in our middle class families, and it was a not-insignificant number. This guy was from a ""normal"" family  like ours and it still happens...On the social ladder it's a whole hell of a lot easier to go down than it is to go up.

(Also, this covers the day-to-day problems with addiction. KSN has a story up about the terminal impact: 144 people in the county died from overdoses involving fentanyl with another 100 possible cases pending lab reports. Compare that to the 54 people killed by homicides in the same period.)

Tom says his parents told him to leave and not come back, and he encourages families to never give up on siblings and children struggling with addiction and mental illness. (NB: He didn't say something like more government housing or higher wages for social workers would have fixed his problems.) This is hard, because I grew up with family members in the same situation and it's not that simple. Parents have to spend a hugely disproportionate amount of time, money, and energy on kids with problems. The normie kids are then left without a fair share of attention and support.

My parents did the best they could. Because they never gave up, my family members affected by problems didn't end up like Tom. It came at a huge cost: wiping out my parents' savings, countless nights at the jail and the ER (sometimes both), and strained relationships that still haven't fully healed and probably never will.

It was worth it to keep them from winding up like Tom. Believing it's cheap, easy, and painless is ignorant though.

Best wishes to Tom and his family. Thanks for posting.

"I am here to be the bearer of bad news: WG is by far the ‚Äúbottom of the barrel‚Äù when it comes to community pharmacy. They are currently underpaying pharmacists somewhere between $46-49/hr, with other retailers offering minimum $55/hr or more. Not only that, the work environment is extremely chaotic as the company continues to slash pharmacy hours for staff. In other words, it‚Äôs more likely than not that the pharmacist at that store may have quit. Many pharmacists are leaving WG for these reasons. Why work in the most stressful environment possible while also being underpaid? As it stands, WG has the highest demand for pharmacists right now, yet no one wants to work there. Pharmacists even make jokes about how they‚Äôd rather be unemployed before they work at WG. 

So, in short, I recommend finding a different pharmacy.

"Maybe we're looking at different graphs, but I'm not seeing two cases for any rolling averages. March 2021 is in the 20s and March 2022 is in the teens. Have you looked at the hospitalization rate or the cumulative sum of cases (30 admit/8 ICU in 2021, 21 admit/4 ICU in 2022)? Looks a whole lot like last March - the numbers are in the same ballpark but lower, which is a good thing.

Keep in mind most people who got Omicron a few months ago are losing their natural immunity and home tests, as well as the end of free covid testing, may also play a role in the difference.

I guess we'll know in a few months. It's nice to have a little break, but sad that everybody is just throwing up their hands.

"I grew up in Wichita and have visited Arizona many times over the years--mostly to visit family in Tucson, but I have passed through all counties in the state.  I'd say Flagstaff has a more pleasing climate than Wichita, with similar temperature ranges in winter, summer highs and lows cooler by about 10¬∞ and 20¬∞ respectively, and less humidity overall.  However, Wichita has about five times the population and thus the ability to support cultural offerings like the public library and the art museum at a higher level.  The economic base is also more diversified, though not to the same degree as in a true global city.  Others' comments about traffic, topographical relief, and outdoor recreation are mostly spot on.  We haven't had tools rust in the garage, but Wichita is in the same K√∂ppen climate zone (Cfa) as much of the Deep South, so summers are humid and A/C is a necessity.  Wichita gets bad hailstorms often enough that I recommend keeping cars garaged.

New things tend to come to Wichita later than they do bigger places--Costco did not open here until 2015, captioning glasses did not come to movie theaters until 2017 (Tucson had had wand captioning for several years before that), etc.  On the other hand, Wichita has an active food scene and has served as an incubator for several restaurant chains over the years, notably White Castle, Pizza Hut, and Freddy's Frozen Custard.",t2_pe5qi,Argatlam,0,1648532238.0,0,t1_i2j56w6,i2j56w6,True,JennC137,t3_tq1llw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/tq1llw/az_to_ks/,AZ to KS?,/r/wichita/comments/tq1llw/az_to_ks/i2j56w6/,2,r/wichita,0,2

"Not the person you're replying to, but coming from Idaho/Utah where there was tons of outdoors stuff to do, there is definitely less here. Most of the lakes nearby are actually reservoirs--Santa Fe Lake, Cheney, & El dorado are the closest, kanapolis and Wilson lake are more interesting, but much farther.
For hiking, there's not tons. There are some trails at the lakes I mentioned, then in town there's Chisholm creek park and Pawnee Prairie park which are more naturalized. Farther out of town I like going to Tall grass Prairie Preserve. For more interesting camping and hiking it's best to drive closer to Arkansas/Oklahoma.
I found I had to switch what outdoors activities I did to really enjoy it here. I started cycling (used to go with a weekly group), and got a paddle board and kayaks.

"I went to school in Prescott so I feel slightly qualified to compare.  There is both good and bad.  AZ is very outdoorsy with lots of good weather, Wichita is neither of those things.  Popular entertainment is indoors: dinner, bowling, movies, etc.  There is no scenery to speak of.  No climbing, skiing, etc.  its colder in the winter and hotter in the summer, with less pleasant days between the two.  

That‚Äôs the bad out of the way.  It‚Äôs got a population about the same as Tucson, so probably much bigger than what you‚Äôre used to, but not so big that it starts to feel like Phoenix.  Its a good medium-sized city.  Good airport.  It‚Äôs about a 3 hour drive to either Kansas City or Oklahoma City, the nearest bigger cities, so it‚Äôs a bit like an island in that leaving town to go shopping or to a pro ball game is a big deal that you probably won‚Äôt do every weekend.  But you have most everything here that you‚Äôd need on a regular basis, probably more than you have in N AZ.  Wichita is a big manufacturing town with lots of good jobs for both blue collar and white collar, so there is money here and in much of the town you can tell.  It just feels nice, clean, and new because it is rapidly growing.  The northern half of the town, especially the east and west extremities, are the nice areas and I would compare them to Scottsdale, except with grass and much, much cheaper.  There is a large and decent state university in town, comparable in size to NAU, plus a few smaller and also decent private schools, so it‚Äôs a well educated town.  Lastly, Wichita is a family town.  There are great schools and great parks and activities for kids.  It‚Äôs a fantastic place to settle down and raise a family.  Combined with the low cost of living, I can‚Äôt think of any better place for that.  But it‚Äôs kind of a boring place to be young and single and looking for a wild time.",t2_ato1b,Dreadpiratemarc,0,1648527475.0,0,t1_i2ixyfh,i2ixyfh,True,JennC137,t3_tq1llw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/tq1llw/az_to_ks/,AZ to KS?,/r/wichita/comments/tq1llw/az_to_ks/i2ixyfh/,3,r/wichita,0,3

"I‚Äôm a transplant from the south. Here‚Äôs my short take. Wichita is nice. Low traffic and great opportunities to build, especially in business. There‚Äôs not a great deal of entertainment but it‚Äôs also not more than a day‚Äôs drive from other great citys so a weekend trip is an easy fix. 
It is however, very conservative. You‚Äôll see a lot less diversity here than you do in places like AZ from what I hear. It‚Äôs not that diverse groups don‚Äôt exist, more like there are several groups that don‚Äôt want diverse groups invading their spaces. On the other side you have diverse groups attempting to force inclusion so you‚Äôll be coming in at a time when there‚Äôs a lot of‚Ä¶ not exactly conflict but passive aggressive politics.

"Per [this site](https://legalbeagle.com/6919931-kansas-atv-laws.html), which is obviously not a legal site and can't be utilized to procure legal advice...

> Registration

> You must register an ATV and receive a title from the Kansas Department of Revenue. Since ATVs are not designed for use on streets, they are classified as a non-highway vehicle. If you wish to sell or trade-in an ATV, it has to be titled in your name. If you bought an ATV, you have a maximum of 30 days to apply for a title. However, If you've owned your ATV since Jun. 30, 1996, or earlier, you don't need a title for your ATV.

> Use on Streets

> It is illegal to use your ATV on any federal interstate, federal highway or state highway. It is also illegal to use an ATV on the streets within the limits of a city of the first class. The Kansas Code classifies any city with a population of more than 15,000 as a city of the first class. This ban on city streets can be overridden if a particular city makes a ruling allowing the use of ATVs.

> Equipment

> It is illegal to ride your ATV on any public road between sunset and sunrise unless your ATV has been fitted with a functioning headlight and taillight.

> Operator Restrictions

> There are essentially no restrictions on who may operate an ATV. There is no license requirement instituted by the Kansas Department of Revenue, nor is there an established age limit for operators.

"As others have said, this really depends on what you value in your day to day life. I recently graduated college and moved here for an exciting job opportunity about a year ago. You‚Äôre going to get responses ranging from ‚Äúit‚Äôs a shit hole‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is the best place I‚Äôve ever lived‚Äù. I‚Äôm somewhere in between. I love the low stress pace of life here, but it‚Äôs only low stress because I live in a nicer apartment complex. There‚Äôs just enough things to do around town to keep you busy, and if you reallllyyy get bored then KC and OKC are only 2.5 hours away. 

The reality is, two people living in Wichita can have two completely different experiences depending on their quality of life, income, neighborhood, hobbies, and social life. The upper middle / upper class neighborhoods in Wichita are realllyyyy nice, and the low income neighborhoods are realllyyy shitty and dangerous. There are companies here that offer high paying jobs in a corporate like environment, and there are companies that offer low pay and toxic work environment.

"I know you are getting lots of grief for these photos but thank you for posting! It sounds like they are personally meaningful and I appreciate your effort. I am not sure what your intention was when you submitted them but it clearly shows a desire for others to see them as well.

When you make the decision to share something with the world, you have to be open to feedback as well.  That's life in the spotlight I guess.. So my feedback is that this ""Dutch Angle/Tilt"" that is in all of your photo's actually means something in the world of photography. Much like there are warm and cool colors, depth of field, contrast etc.. the use of the angles is used to convey confusion and instability. It is at a skewed angle to purposely throw off one's conventional way of viewing the subject. In that way, the photographer in sharing their work is telling the viewer to see/feel confusion.  The problem in your photos is that the subject has nothing to do with confusion/instability.  It is actually of a very beautiful and calm subject.  The contrast between your angle/tilt and the calm subject is what makes these hard to look at.

I know this is unsolicited education/advice, but I hope you can take it or leave it in such a way that acknowledges my intent is to be helpful.

There is a strong sense of minding one's business here.

"You will not find difficult hiking paths. All will be on the easy end. Nature scenery will be mostly open fields, but you can find a wooden area. You'll have to take a trip to Colorado or elsewhere for a hiking adventure. I will say it gets brutal during the winter and early spring. That wind can hit you going over 70mph, remember, this was Dust Bowl Land. Cost of living is cheaper than the rest of the states. The government system I dislike, stuck back in the 1980s. Don't sell the house yet, the value will keep going up, because not just people working from home are moving into the city.

"I've only visited Northern AZ but I can say that the hiking here is like going for a walk in comparison. I grew up in northeast Iowa and spent time hiking trails and rock climbing along river bluffs. To find a hiking area similar to what I was used to, I found it was 2 hours to Kanapolis or Elk River, 4 hours to NW Arkansas, 3-4 hours to places in Oklahoma. We moved to Wichita 18 years ago and I honestly felt trapped inside the first few years. I finally took up kayaking to accommodate my need to get out and be active on a whim. I love the Wichita area for the most part, am glad winter isn't 5 months long like Iowa, I'm not a huge fan of 100 degree days or 25+ mph winds, but I think it's comfortable, not too big, not too small and centrally located to several other cities and attractions that are easy to drive to in 4-8 hours.",t2_5z4zla9c,CaseNo1642,0,1648481047.0,0,t1_i2g3zol,i2g3zol,False,JennC137,t3_tq1llw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/tq1llw/az_to_ks/,AZ to KS?,/r/wichita/comments/tq1llw/az_to_ks/i2g3zol/,1,r/wichita,0,1

"Yes, I am well aware of that.  My comment was a quip at your seeming to not understand the definition of the word ""literally"" (you were speaking metaphorically), and the fact that you are gaining in equity is not relevant in a discussion about the monthly expenses when comparing the two.  Yes, equity is very important when you go to move, but 100% irrelevant when making a monthly budget.

Also, though homes are increasing in value right now, that is not always the case and cannot be assumed to be a ""sure thing"" for increasing your wealth.  In fact the way the banks and lenders are set up, it's to intentionally cause periodic housing market crashes so the truly wealthy can swoop in and buy foreclosures at rock bottom rates.  So unless you've done some serious planning to make certain you don't lose your house to the next housing bubble pop all your ""investments"" are for naught.

"There are too many anonymous lip-flappers and mud-slingers in the world. Then, there are those brave enough to stand up to the very well-off and and those in the halls of power, who, through wealth, oppression, and denial of such things as equal rights and fair treatment, take egregious advantage of the less fortunate. I take and make a stand, calling out such injustices. Especially, on behalf of minorities; you know, like people of color.  
  
If you think for one minute that doing this doesn't put my own life in jeopardy, put down that pipe and get real.  
  
This isn't only about homeowners. When property taxes are too high, renters feel the burden, too. It used to be they could also apply for a homestead tax rebate, but the legislature took that away.

It's  nice that they have ATMs at every Kroger/Dillon's and inside every QT - you are never far from cash in Wichita if you use intrust. One time one of my signatures looked different on a check, and they actually called me to ask if it was legit - i really appreciated that effort, they actually paid attention to how my signature looks! I had a torn ligament at the time so signing with my left hand made for ugly signatures. Did not delay the transaction, but they were prepared to cancel it if I'd said the word. Excellent service.

I just wanted a separate savings account to siphon away extra cash and make it harder to access to help with self-discipline. Turns out i just gave them my money ... and they took it. Literally.
