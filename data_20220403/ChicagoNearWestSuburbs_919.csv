"I personally hate it.  I'm in my early 30's, just got engaged, no kids. Closed on a condo just 1 year ago, and I want to sell it.  The building is noisy, but that's just my building!  

The town, however, is becoming increasingly more dangerous imo.  Just literally this morning at 5AM, near the 290 entrance ramp (I take it almost every day myself) a 19-year-old pregnant woman was randomly shot in her car while stopped at a redlight.  Apparently, some really cool bros in a white SUV just pulled up and decided to open fire at her.  Yay!  She was hit in the leg and she'll be okay... but yay...  Guess what?  This is like the 3rd time something like this has happened within a 1 mile radius in the last 2 months!  

Recently, some thieves stole 17 catalytic converters from an open parking lot in FP. They did get caught, which is rare tbh.  It seems like every time I read about a shooting in FP, ""nobody was arrested"" and ""the investigation is ongoing"". I feel like crime just moseys its way on over to FP from the Green line and blue line every day, and the innocent people like you and me are casualties.  I personally can't wait to move this time next year, (if I'm not randomly shot in my car on the way to work).  The mayor is useless... there's like only 20 police officers on our force, to the point that we need to borrow officers from neighboring towns... believe me, they are too busy to tend to every crime in this town...or rather, they're too slow to catch them?  Either way, no thanks.  

I would move to LaGrange or Glen Ellyn.  And I'm sorry for such bitter, angry words. But I'm reeling from the shooting this morning still. I complained about it on an FP facebook page and was asked, ""Why dont you just move?"" these are the kind of responses I always get, too... fuck those guys. Let them sit at those redlights, I warned them...I'll be away soon enough.

Oh, one more story: Feb of last year: my gf and I are moving our stuff out of our last apt, and 2 teens are shot at in a parking lot just several feet from where we were inside. Yay!

Also, 290 brings the risk of carjackings by people from not in the immediate area. Maybe fairly minimal, but non-zero, and worse than areas not close to 290.

"Forest Park is a favorite. Great night life, active community, it realy is the best of city life in a suburb. I grew up in oak park and spent a lot of time in forest park with friends. In my 20s I moved there and can agree  that Madison can occasionally get dicey on the weekends. I lived off of circle just north of 290 and south of Madison and it was quiet, easy to walk to the blue line. Later on lived on Marengo north of Madison and on Des plains just south of the metra. Both areas were still quiet and easy walks to downtown shopping and the green line and metra trains. 

Note that parking can be an issue. Make sure wherever you rent comes with parking for your vehicle (s). The permit parking situation is kind of a mess and you can be driving from lot to lot looking for a place to park. 

I have friends with kids in the elementary schools, no complaints! However, the high school is not the best. 

Best advice is to take time to get to know the neighborhood, visit on weekends- get breakfast at the pancake house. Walk the strip and window shop. If there's a community event, attend.

"No, we had to move due to space, so we moved before pre-k started. 

As for crime? I don't think it was bad compared to the surrounding areas. I also can't say for sure. I think the end of the Blue Line means there's likely more homeless folks around, but they didn't exactly cause many crimes. And Madison Street can get rough in places after the bars let out, but if you're not on Madison Street at that time, it's not really a problem. We lived a block from Madison for 5 years and only really noticed the bars on big nights like Paddy's Day, NYE and around Halloween. And it was totally fine. Maybe just a tad louder than normal.

"Hey, Forest Park is great! It's a neat little suburb with an active downtown and wonderful neighbors. You get the transportation of the city, but the feeling if a suburb or a small Chicago neighborhood. It's honestly a dream spot. Relatively cheap, but still has stuff going on.

I lived there for 5 years, and we tried to make it work with a new house, but the high school situation was too much of a gamble. We ended up in Riverside. If public schools are not your thing, then Forest Park is the best spot. 

I honestly can't say if it's getting better or worse. I think Forest Park was seen as *kinda rough* when I was growing up, but I don't think it was any different than it is now. The difference was that the towns around it didn't have as many (or any) bars. So everyone partied in Forest Park. We had a lot of dive bars back in the 90s. But I was allowed to walk around go pretty much wherever. And that would still be the case, I bet. 

I think Covid has impacted the bar scene in a few ways that are difficult to say, but the fact that other towns have embraced booze and beer has made bars in Forest Park less profitable anyhow. So maybe it's in a weird transition. 

It's a great spot, with maybe proviso east being the only major problem.",t2_5fu3n,KilowogTrout,0,1641875297.0,0,t1_hs5z5af,hs5z5af,True,mukked721,t3_s12wel,https://www.reddit.com/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/s12wel/forest_park_help/,Forest Park Help,/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/s12wel/forest_park_help/hs5z5af/,9,r/NearWestSuburbs,0,9

"Re the sewage smell: Are there any drains in or near your apartment (public areas, mechanical room, laundry) that aren't often used? Water will evaporate from the p-traps in these drains, allowing sewer gases to escape. These need to be filled regularly (either through use of a fixture or intentionally) to prevent evaporation.

"I lived off Lombard Ave and Chicago for almost 5 years.  And I had to park my car a block away from Austin Ave in a permit lot out there for a year.  Nothing ever happened to my car, no one ever bothered me walking to/from my car late night, early mornings and in between.  We walked our dog 4 times a day, including one last walk around the block at 11pm, never felt unsafe, there were always a bunch of people walking their dogs all times of the day.  

We lived across from the 7/11 on Chicago Ave.  There was a steady stream of people walking over and back from the Austin neighborhood to buy stuff, but they never bothered us.  The store itself was robbed like 3 or 4 times during our stay there, but they were after money, not hurting people.  

I'd say the most dangerous part of living there was the cars that speed down the streets in the area.  More often than not, I wouldn't ever risk walking in front of the cars even if they stopped bc some jerk would try to go around them and almost hit us!  Even after they installed the crosswalk lights right in front of the 7/11 I almost got hit by some lady not paying attention.

That said, we did carry pepper spray pretty regularly, but that was mostly for piece of mind.

It was a very beautiful place to live and I absolutely miss walking around that neighborhood.",t2_dfav4,test5407,0,1621355355.0,0,t1_gyl3xpr,gyl3xpr,True,[deleted],t3_nez0pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/nez0pc/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/nez0pc/deleted_by_user/gyl3xpr/,4,r/NearWestSuburbs,0,4

"This is some old nonsense (partially rooted in racism because Austin = crime) that I’ve heard passed around when I moved here a decade ago. Take it from someone who’s always lived east of Ridgeland, and bought a house 2 blocks away from scary Austin Blvd, the entire village is safe. The crime that happens here is crime of opportunity, and it doesn’t matter where you live. The North side of the village, especially north of Chicago, is much quieter in terms of crime, but that’s just because it’s much less dense than the rest of the village.

"I'm a big nerd; my favorite place in the city/world is Logan Arcade in Logan Square - right now they're only open on weekends with reservations, and they're VERY HARDCORE about masks/distancing. But even with those limitations, I still had a great time the one time I went since lockdown.

My other favorite place is the Garfield Park Conservatory, especially in the winter. Just walking around all those plants is such a lift.

"I rented from him 25 yrs ago on Burlington. Shocked he's not been to jail 10X already. He had a shady remodeling company at the time. I moved there from Chicago and didn't know his history but locals quickly told me who I was renting from. I spent 4-5 yrs in his building and just took care of shit myself as not to have to deal with him and live in peace. Final straw is he sent me a letter of intent to renew the lease saying my rent would be the same and just ""sign"". I signed adding I would reup as long as there were no changes in the terms of the lease.  When I received the actual lease (this was 25 yrs ago) he had raised my rent about $200-250? a month on a $500 rent.  I was willing to meet him halfway. He said no, he didn't recognize his ""agents"" signature on the intent.  I told him I would live in a motel before I gave him another dime.

I rented a place a few blocks north of Madison for a few years. It was nice having the bar scene in my 20's but not really my thing anymore. 

My wife and I rented a place south of 290 for five years, and that was pretty close to Harlem. Louder, but never felt unsafe.

We liked the neighborhood so much, we bought a house a few blocks away in 2015. With all of the quarantine stuff going on, I've walked most of FP between 290 and Roosevelt. My wife is in the restaurant industry and I was never concerned about her coming home at night.  


Nowhere is 100% safe, but a lot of FP is quiet and feels like Oak Park Jr. The farther from the major streets, it'll certainly be quieter - depending on what you're looking for.",t2_4e2v2,burstaneurysm,0,1591157985.0,0,t1_fspogm7,fspogm7,True,[deleted],t3_gtwk2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/gtwk2p/forest_park_safe_for_a_20something_year_old/,Forest Park - safe for a 20something year old female alone?,/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/gtwk2p/forest_park_safe_for_a_20something_year_old/fspogm7/,1,r/NearWestSuburbs,0,1

Personally I’ve never had any issues with the blue line. I can’t even count how many times I’ve taken that to Hawks games and downtown since I was a kid. But I still like to be aware of my surroundings. But most of the time it’s a quiet ride. Getting on 290 at Harlem Ave it’s usually 15-20 minutes to UIC. A car isn’t strictly necessary but it’s still nice for this area. Close to Madison and you have a lot of bar/restaurant and boutique shop options.

To be honest, barking is a really difficult issue to address with some dogs. If she’s barking because she needs to go out, should be an easy fix with a dog walker. But if it’s for another reason it may take a long time to resolve and may not improve.

Involving the police may be your best option.

"At least in OP, there are crossing guards at most major streets for the school start/end times, so that should help with the walking to school issue.  We live in the Lincoln district but on the other side of the Ike, so our kids will ride a bus to get to school.  But once they get to middle school, it seems that everyone just walks (there is a constant parade of them in front of our house every morning, including crossing the Home Ave. foot bridge over the Ike).

As for the sociability/parties thing, that is very much block-dependent.  I've heard anecdotally that 700 Clinton is really good for that, but don't have much other concrete info.  Our block is pretty good but we don't do much outside of the block party.

"We live in SEOP and our two kids go to Longfellow. It's about a 5 minute walk to school. On our block, there's around 25 kids high school age and under. On a lot of days there's a pack of at least 6 kids walking to school together. Sometimes it's one parent, sometimes it's three or four. I'm not sure if our block is unusual but we're all pretty cool with each other and there's very little drama. Yesterday we had 6 other kids in our house hanging out. That's not out of the ordinary. When the weather is even semi-decent, it's not at all uncommon to see kids from the block all over the place; riding bikes, scooters, skateboards, etc. When I walk around our little section of OP, I see this kind of thing a lot. 

Our block, like pretty much everyone in OP will have a block party or two between May - early October. The street is blocked off, there's often a bounce house, tons of games, kids everywhere. Sometimes there's food trucks, some are catered, some are potlucks. Most blocks have a committee for this sort of thing. They're a really good time. I see them all the time in our neck of the woods. I would assume north OP is similar but I don't spend a lot of time up there so I can't say for certain. 

As far as finding specific blocks, it's really hard to say. My best suggestion would be to drive all over OP when the weather is nice on a non-holiday weekend - try to time it for late afternoon, before dinner but after soccer, dance, baseball, and all the other various extracurriculars have wrapped up for the day. Seriously don't be afraid to walk around and talk to people. Check out Lake Street. Check out the Art's District, check Oak Park Avenue near 290. I'd say those are the main hubs for restaurants and shops.

As far as schools, we love Longfellow. I don't know what your kids' needs are but I know lots of people have different experiences. In regards to walkability, loads of people walk or ride bikes all over OP and RF. [Here's a map of district 97.](https://www.op97.org/hr/district-map) There's crossing guards at all most intersections. Another thing to keep in mind is that Madison Street from Austin to Harlem is undergoing a huge transition right now. It will go from two lanes to one lane in each direction with bike lanes on both sides, a turn lane in the middle and much friendlier for pedestrians. However, this will increase traffic on the streets north and south of Madison. It's called the ""road diet"" and there's a good amount of info on it online. So, if you're looking at houses near Madison, don't immediately be turned off because it's going to look completely different in a few months. 

I'd also recommend checking out some of the neighborhood FB pages. OP has a FB page for each section of the village. There's a property tax page. There's social justice-related pages. There's a dad's group, a mom's group, resale pages, etc. All of them are lively, to say the least.

"Honestly, it fluctuates fairly wildly. A $1.8 million dollar Frank Lloyd Wright home just sold a few weeks ago, and there's another $800,000 one up for sale. If you can, take a drive through Riverside, there's some truly beautiful old homes and hardly any McMansions. You can find smallish homes for around $300k, and they will be relatively close to the trains. But a budget of $500k will get you a lot more. I've seen some good deals for $400k, too. There are areas of Berwyn like this, too. Some beautiful homes, and some classic Chicago bungalows.  

It's not exactly a lively town, but there are some decent spots at the Riverside Train stop. I'm in an odd area of town that's mostly apartments with some converted two flats.

"I'd check the taxes in Maywood - I hear they are high and you don't get much in return. I believe they had some sort of public works or infrastructure issue and the taxes are high to compensate...but check on that, I'm not 100% certain.

Forest Park is nice - taxes lower than River Forest or Oak Park, and there are a ton of programs through the park district, and the village plows the alleys and sidewalks!

"Yeah, the access is there in the downtown area which tends to be more pricey. If you look in the central Berwyn area you are right near Metra and it has a small town feel to it. You may have more luck finding property in the Northern part of Berwyn - the neighborhoods tend to be better farther west in the northern part.

Yeah, not a lot of properties up in FP right now, but if you keep your eyes open you may find something. I would steer clear of Roosevelt Rd  and Harlem Ave if you can help it - they are just super busy so probably not the most appealing for having a nice dog walk. But definitely a great little downtown area and they are very encouraging of small business so you get really unique shops. Also steer clear of the few blocks directly near Thorntons - cops are always at that gas station.

"I've lived in the area for 20+ years. Berwyn and Forest Park are decent communities as far as safety, affordability, walkability and community.

You may also be able to find decent deals in Oak Park or River Forest, but the property taxes will be higher.

"Bertolli's Pizza (River Forest, but close enough)

Exit Strategy for food and beer

Heritage for cocktails and upscale food - sit at the bar and chat with the bartenders!

Scratch for brunch (the man wrap especially)

Madison Park Kitchen or Louie's for breakfast

Brown Cow ice cream

Beacon Pub is the best dive (and excellent outdoor space)

Mexican Republic has great margaritas. Tacabron is a different vibe but the food is great

Famous Liquors has excellent customer service and tasting events, also right next to Exit, so you can get a drink to take home 

Amy's Wine House

I haven't been to Golden Steer yet, but I hear it's a fun old-school steak place vibe

I'm partial to Counter Coffee for my caffeine, but Blue Max is good too

Not food related, but Schauer's Hardware and Forest Park Emporium are my favorite shops on Madison.

The Heritage and Gaetano's for the best dining. Very good food.

Scratch has killer food (Made from scratch) and a decent beer menu. I like the vibe and music there.

Tacabron, Cactus Grill and Mexican republic have very good Mexican food.

It is dangerous, but if you're heading into the city and you take 26th over to Ogden, the left turn arrow gives you enough of a head start that you can get through the underpass well before any cars will overtake you.",t2_10yds,khoker,0,1536091486.0,0,t1_e5e7xh3,e5e7xh3,False,KilowogTrout,t3_9cvrx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/9cvrx8/any_bike_commuters_here_looking_for_route_tips/,Any bike commuters here?

"I replied to OP but the secret to Ogden past Pulaski is to figure out the timings and just wait until the cars go by so you can own the lane.

For example, when going west on Ogden -- sit at the corner of Ogden/Pulaski and wait for the cars coming behind you to pass or the light to turn red.  Then own the road up to Keeler.  From Keeler, if traffic is backed up, hop on the sidewalk (it's fine) and make your way up to Kostner.  When the light turns green at Kostner, ride slowish on the right side and internally count to 40.  At 40 seconds, you'll be able to own Ogden through the under-pass at the train tracks/26th.",t2_10yds,khoker,0,1536091255.0,0,t1_e5e7o1k,e5e7o1k,False,KilowogTrout,t3_9cvrx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/9cvrx8/any_bike_commuters_here_looking_for_route_tips/,Any bike commuters here?

"Hey, so I've actually done this route 9-10 months out of the year, going on 10 years now.  There's some variation available, but the correct answer is to go through Berwyn to Cicero, then up to 26th, then over to Ogden, and then Ogden all the way in.  The ""trick"" isn't route, it's really more about being aware of traffic patterns and timings.   26th bothers me sometimes because of parked cars, but it is what it is.  Ogden is reasonably safe if you just learn to stop at a few different intersections and let all the cars go by.  Might cost you 1-2 minutes on the commute, but it makes the ride infinitely more enjoyable.   For comparison, I spent 10 years riding a bike in the city and I'll take Ogden over Milwaukee any day.

As for the alternatives -- I actually used to skip 26th and take Ogden all the way in, but there's only so many times you feel OK with a semi passing 5 feet away from you at 65MPH before you cross that option off the list.  And Lake street, to me, is just a visibility nightmare for bikes and adds about 25 minutes to the commute each way.

The reality is that Ogden is fine once you get past Pulaski because you can ride on those extended 'service' lanes on each side.  If you want to feel slightly safer and avoid Ogden as much as you can before getting to Pulaski, another option is taking 26th \*past\* Ogden and then weaving though side streets before taking Pulaski back up to Ogden.   But, again, if you understand the timing of lights and traffic, Ogden is fine.

If you want, we can hook up in Riverside and I can ride you in a few times to get you comfortable.

"I've ridden both of those routes plenty of times and honestly, between Ogden and Lake Street, Lake Street is most likely your best bet, and is the route that I prefer to take. I live in south Berwyn, and am much closer to Ogden, but the portion of Ogden near the intersection of Cicero Ave that goes through the tunnel underneath the BNSF train line is really dangerous. There's not a whole of room in there for bike traffic and cars are usually flying through there at 35+ mph. I've had lots of close calls with ignorant drivers in that tunnel, and that makes it a deal breaker for me most of the time.

As for other routes besides those two, there's not a whole lot to choose from, at least in terms of bigger streets. There's Cermak and Roosevelt, but I'm not too familiar with either.

Bodhi Thai

**In Cicero:**

Freddy's Pizza: I recommend everything your eye can see, special shout out for the gelato.

Los Chilaquiles: I like their breakfast.

Las Gorditas de Don Angel: Get the gorditas, shredded beef is my favorite.

**In North Riverside:**

Taqueria El Milagro in the mall: Everyone raves about the steak tacos but I recommend the pork in green sauce tacos. Also, for Lent they have special options on Ash Wednesday and Fridays, including zucchini/corn tacos and fish tacos. And the tamales are the best.

Chef Shangri-La: Not sure about the food since i haven't been in a while but the ambience is great.

"To give a somewhat fuller answer to the two separate questions--why Oak Park has so few and Forest Park so many.  
Question number 1.  Oak Park, as others have noted, was completely dry for many years.  You couldn't even get a glass of wine with dinner.  This was no doubt because of the general feeling (not incorrect) that alcohol causes people to do bad things and a community where people do fewer bad things is a better community.  The [Women's Christian Temperance Union] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman%27s_Christian_Temperance_Union) was, and still is, based in Evanston and was once the largest women's organization in the world.  Although obviously the anti-alcohol movement doesn't  have the political clout in had at its peak, when prohibition was passed, there are still [many cities and counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dry_communities_by_U.S._state) all over the country that prohibit or strictly limit alcohol sales.  Oak Park finally realized it was never going to have any kind of successful restaurant scene unless it loosened up, and has now done so considerably.
Question number 2--why does Forest Park have so many bars?  The answer, and this is not a joke, is because Oak Park (and, for that matter, River Forest) were dry.  All those drinkers had to go somewhere so the borders of Oak Park are lined with bars, not just in Forest Park, but in Berwyn and Chicago as well.  But there's a bit more to the story.  Forest Park is famous for its cemeteries (estimates suggest there are 30 dead people for every live person in the village).  Lots of funeral processions came out to Forest Park.  The mourners needed somewhere to have a drink after the burial.  Bars were established to meet that need.  

TL;DR  Alcohol bad so not in Oak Park.  Oak Park drunks had to go somewhere so they went to Forest Park.  So did dead people.

"Grew up in oak park, currently living in Lisle on the Naperville border. Oak park is great, forest park will be a bit cheaper apartment wise and has better nightlife than O.P.  Don't forget to check out Berwyn if you're trying to stay close to the bnsf. Remember that oak park is on a different Metra line so you'll need to get to the bnsf from oak park to get to your job in Naperville. Oak park is a transportation hub to Chicago with the up-w Metra line, and both green and blue lines. I find that area more walk friendly. But oak park is expensive because of the great school district. And, some areas are a bit more sketchy due to their proximity to the Austin neighborhood. 
I wouldn't discount ""naperthrill"" there's a lot of awesome out here. The forest preserves, river, night life, and access to EVERYTHING is really convenient. However, it's a car dependent area. I was really apprehensive about moving so far out, but now I love it, and the bnsf expresses to the city from here which is great for my daily commute. However, yes, apartments will probably run you a bit more. Most apartments further west are complex style so you get a gym and pool included in your rent. Oak park might have one high rise with amenities, but it's going to cost you. 
You might try out the weekday commute- check out things like parking availability, overall cost and time before making a decision. Check out both neighborhoods, go see if there's a hobby you can do more of in one location or the other. They are both fabulous and you'll find a good home in either. 
ETA: oak park- parking is a commodity. You're going to pay for it, and a lot. The village requires a sticker if you live within it, and then you'll need a permit or a meter spot by the train. Forest park is similar. The closer you live to the city the harder parking is. Further west by Naperville the Metra stations also do permit and meter spots, but Weekends are not as heavily regulated. Bus, bike, and walk are recommended for both.  Pm me for any other questions. Happy to help and can recommend some apartments in the oak park area, or further west.  Good luck!

"You can park overnight in the parking garages for cheap (but actually aren't allowed to park on the street overnight without a special permit) . Most people walk/ride a bike/take a bus to the L or Metra but there are parking spots at the station you can pay $1/hour to park in. Lots of people drive out to the suburbs for work too. I would be hesitant to live more than a 15 min walk (3/4 mile) from the train - we live around Chicago Ave & Harlem and it's doable but further North than Augusta would be a trek.  Hope that helps!

I would expect that to go pretty fast, but the cashier had other plans, and decided to scan each can individually.    You have to really understand this process to figure out how comical it is.   The guy was buying two little palette things of cat food, each with 12 columns and two deep.  The process went like this;    
   
Take one out.    
Scan it.   
Put it to the side.   
Take the one below it out.

Put it back.

"time will tell.  I feel like city gaming subreddits are small in impact and userbase. Of course Chicago is not a city its a nation. It does have a city gaming subreddit. Where does this leave smaller cities in Illinois. I feel like the chicago subreddit should be more successful, I suspect they have trouble promoting it. This is because when I promote this subreddit on a gaming reddit or other site. I advertise 5 different allied state subreddits, this  covers so many people the mods do not remove it. If i just said hey gamers in Chicago come check out this subreddit it applies to so few people it might get removed.

 I believe that southern illinois gamer subreddit would be even smaller because who identifies as that( people think of states and cities). Hopefully we can eventually get competition going between the different states in the alliance, using state pride as a tool to hype up the participants.

If you are looking for someone in your town or neighborhood, I think you should use this subreddit and r/IllinoisGamers . That's covering all your bases.

TLDR its a matter of opinion but mine is that state subreddits are the perfect size.  City subreddits are too small and a Midwest Gamers subreddit is too big. Regional Subreddits are too obscure.

"Dog?  Nice.  What kind?  I have a 3 y/o German Shepherd.  There's a new dog park just north of North Riverside on 1st Ave, but you have to buy in to get a key or something.  There's an *amazing* (free) dog park is in Hinsdale (15 min drive west) called [Katherine Legge](https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/2765/).  It's gigantic.  Actually doubles as a frisbee golf course.   I can't stress how nice that park is, even by people standards.

"> Little Bohemia looks like it'll be a surprise favorite, too.  
   
I want to reiterate that I've never eaten there.  There's another Czech style restaurant on Harlem and Lawton aptly called ""Riverside Restaurant"".  It's interesting.  Cash-only, but really cheap.  You get soup, and entree, two sides and desert for $7 or something.   I'm not a huge fan of the food but my wife's family likes it.   
   
> Parks or things to see?   
   
The area next to the river (by the library) is a really nice walk.  There's a trail that follows the river for a little bit.  I think it might be be called Swan Park?  I'm not sure.  Also, in the winter, they set up an ice rink in ""Ball"" Park.  That's the in middle of town.   
  
There is also an ongoing effort to extend the Salt Creek bike trail down past (or possibly through) Riverside.  That connects to the Prairie Path and some others and goes waaay out west.  Some maps [here](http://www.dupageco.org/EDP/Bikeways_and_Trails/1150/).   
   
Another good restaurant/bar I forgot is Irish Times in Brookfield.  Cozy inside, nice outdoor seating as well.  Definitely put that on the list.

"If it ever gets cold again in the winter, they'll have an ice-skating rink at Longcommon Park. 

Also by the police station (east side) there is a pedestrian bridge that goes over the river. Pretty good scenery. If you go across it, you can have easy access down to the river bed as well as some small trails.

"I second most of these. 

* Peter is one of the dudes at the grocery store - at least the guy who buys the beer. Top notch selection, up-to-date on beermenus.com, and they kept it fresh, and refrigerated. My go-to spot in the 'burbs for craft beer (I live in Brookfield now, but still work in the city, and about 5 minutes from a Binny's, so it's a tough decision sometimes). 
* The Chew Chew is fantastic although the somewhat re-did their menu a year or so ago. Regardless, I've been no less than 8 times and had a great experience every time. They used to have this cumin-rubbed skirt steak with pickled onions that was out of this world and less than $20, but it's now gone :(
* I might miss the library the most. Especially taking my daughter there. When I first moved there, it took around a month to get my internet set-up, so I was basically living at the library writing my thesis. Haven't been there in a while, but the staff at that time was great. There was one staff member, a middle-aged guy who could recommend anything under the sun, it seemed. Super friendly. [This children's book](https://www.amazon.com/Bats-at-Library-Brian-Lies/dp/061899923X) is based on the Riverside public library. 
* Burger Antics is my new, go-to place to take friends and family from out-of-town. It's just simply great from the food to the beer to the service (it's small) to the atmosphere (not much, but just ""welcoming""). I now live within walking distance to Brixie's, so that's a no-brainer. Buckledown is in Lyons and a great place as well.

I lived in Forest Park for forever, so I'm vaguely aware of the area. And we were looking for a house in Brookfield for a long time, so I know the Galloping Ghost and Brixies well. 

The restaurants all look awesome. Very excited to try Chew Chew and La Barra. Little Bohemia looks like it'll be a surprise favorite, too. I'll be very close to Molly's, which is awesome. 

And thanks for all the Berwyn tips.

"I've been in Riverside for a while (moved from the city).  Here's my $0.02;

*  The grocery store is surprisingly good.  If they don't have something, ask the owner and it will get ordered (especially good for alcohol).  You'll see a markup on some things, but their meat is really well priced.   
   
*  For food, the new Pizza place, La Barra, is very solid.  I put their thick crust pizza at about 75% of Pequods, if that means anything to you.  Across the street from that is Empanadas, and those things are really good as well.  Down the street from those and across from the grocery store is the ""Chew Chew"", which was one of Open Table's top-10 restaurants in the Chicago area.  Upscale but not outrageous.   A real hidden gem.  In the middle of all there there's a weird Bohemian restaurant called ... Little Bohemia.  Might be great?  I've never tried it.  Molly's (Irish Bar) has above-average bar food as well.  Nice outdoor seating when the weather is nice.   
   
*  For drinks, the aforementioned Molly's Public House is a nice spot of a drink.  Quincy Street Distillery (other side of the tracks) is a great place as well, although they only serve their own liquor (no beer) and, as a tasting room, their hours are restricted.  I don't think they stay open past 10PM, and only 3-4 nights a week.  Someone else recommended the James Joyce across Harlem.  I'm not fan of that place, but if you keep going there is a spot called Lavernge's in Berwyn that is killing it.  Way-above-average bar food and a fantastic beer and drink list.  Also check out Quan's Oasis -- the green building on the corner of Quincy and Harlem that looks like a gas station that closed 15 years ago.  If you like dive bars, that's a place to go.   Not open late but they will stay open as long as you want to drink there.
   
*  The Riverside library is amazing.  The reading room is beautiful, if you want a quiet place to hang out.  

*  Nearby, check out Burger Antics in Brookfield for a really good burger.  Also Brookfield has (what I believe to be) the world's largest arcade, [the Galloping Ghost](http://www.gallopingghostarcade.com/).  $20 gets you in the door and all games are free.

"There is a partial quiet zone in the area. In fact right now I hear locomotives and no whistles. I got used to the whistles at night, but it's been quieter lately.

There are crossings at Narragansett, Sayre, Nordica, Neva, Harlem, 73rd, 75th, and Grand. Thats eight crossings in two miles. Some crossings are only a block apart. There isn't time for another short-short-long-short between crossings. I've heard freight engineers just lay on the horn continuously and blast their way through. Metra is usually quieter and briefer unless there's interference (usually people running in front of the train to cross the tracks at the station...).

Note that even in a quiet zone, an engineer has some discretion for emergencies or personnel on the track.

More info at [The Train Horn Rule and Quiet Zones](https://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0889).

Here's information on the [2005 Grand Avenue accident](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/HAB0803.aspx). I was actually on Grand Avenue at that crossing about 10 minutes prior. I stopped at the crossing stop line, but cars were backed up onto the tracks. I actually said out loud in my car, ""if an express comes through, you guys are toast.""

Edit to add: ... To make the crossing safer, trains were limited to 30 mph (from 70 mph for passenger trains), foliage was removed for better sight lines, the pavement was striped and warning signs installed, and other improvements.

They're working on getting funding for a grade separation.",t2_aquyq,fivetoedslothbear,0,1486010068.0,0,t1_dd81a8b,dd81a8b,True,SignorinaMia,t3_5riyo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/5riyo4/train_horns_in_oak_parkelmwood_parkgalewood/,Train horns in Oak Park/Elmwood Park/Galewood,/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/5riyo4/train_horns_in_oak_parkelmwood_parkgalewood/dd81a8b/,3,r/NearWestSuburbs,0,3

Without clarification of your interests and needs, that's all I can offer as insight.

"I'd second Forest Park too. Great downtown, affordable and has better access to the city via CTA Blue Line and 290, as well as the west burbs. Lots of different ways to get out there.   
  
Forest Park is more walkable than Berwyn as well. Parking will be a little tighter depending, but many apartments offer parking. 
  
As far as crime, I wouldn't consider most of Berwyn to be unsafe, but overall crime rates are a little higher, and definitely vary depending on location. Berwyn borders the west side and Cicero, which does account for higher crime.

"Berwyn isn't bad at all, although I think north of the tracks is probably better than south overall.    
    
You mentioned studios.  There's a few apartments that line the train tracks that don't look ... that great.  Not exactly prime real-estate, as the railroad is shared by freight trains that can be loud.  Were there specific apartments you were looking at?  I ride my bike to downtown Chicago every day so I could swing by and check them out.   
   
As alternatives, I would also suggest Brookfield and Riverside.  Riverside has some apartment buildings and it's one of the more unique places to live in all of the Chicago area.

"Logan Square has been ""up and coming"" for a long time, but never quite gets over the hump. Hold-outs and spill-over from Humbolt Park make the day/night differences stand out starkly. Berwyn, Forest Park, Elmwood Park, Lyons, Brookfield are of that vibe, without the night sweats. They all provide ready acess to the city, but $500-550 is well above the typical home price. Berwyn and Forest Park have high school issues. (Morton and Proviso) The CTA and Metra trains both serve the city.
Both I-290 and I-55 present rush hour delays. 
Oak Park and LaGrange are in your price range with taxes to match. IMO, both are similar to Glen Ellyn. Oak Park being slightly edgier and diverse.
In short all of the inner ring western suburbs meet some of your criteria. You should try to spend some time in each. The vibes differ in each, but you'll know quickly which one feels like what you're seeking.

"You could get a decent house in Oak Park with $550k. The schools are great and pretty much everywhere in Oak Park is convenient. 

Riverside is also a good option, but a bit more quiet. It's seriously idyllic and a very nice suburb. River Forest is similar but from my experience, the most expensive of all 3. 

In terms of the city, Galewood is nice and cheap. There are other parts of the city up North that are nice, too. But I don't know much about them. 

I'm currently looking in Brookfield which is very nice and on the Metra like Riverside.

"I live in La Grange Park. Still close to Metra and downtown La Grange. Obviously can still drive to Blue Line. 

I like it enough - we're renting right now but looking to buy either here or Brookfield. Like another poster said, Riverside is out of our budget for the most part.

There's lots of stuff to do (Greenway is still close - runnable and definitely bikable if that's your thing), we joined the Westchester pool this summer which was closer than the Forest Park pool so we made more use of our pool passes. Oak Brook is close for shopping but so is No. Riverside if we need something there. 

 My commute is shitty (work on south side) but nothing I can really do. The Jewel there is pretty crappy as well as expensive (compared to other stores) so I generally plan out meals and make a big trip to Tony's every week instead of the Jewel that's a mere hop-skip-and jump from our place.

"Oak Park has a fairly complex permit system. Day, Night and 24hr permits, zoned on-street, off-street, business district, high demand, garages, lots...etc.  The parking sticker you buy determines where and when you can park within the village. SFAIK, there are no ""assigned"" spaces. The permit allows you to compete for a space based on demand and proximity. Some areas have more permits than available spaces. It takes some study to determine which best suits your needs, but often the price difference between peace of mind and a ticket or three makes an ""upgrade"" the wisest path to take.

If you keep your eyes open for trouble it's pretty easy to avoid. Explore the neighborhood during the day/evening until you know your way around.

Longfellow actually. You're close to the park and middle school so lotsa kids running around. Dunkin donuts nearby as well as mcd. Police station right there too so I'm going yo assume it's safe. ,t2_8o3x7,BABarista,0,1467476225.0,0,t1_d4wp1ul,d4wp1ul,True,kcalam,t3_4qv7hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/4qv7hv/moving_to_s_cuylermaddisonridgewood_area_thoughts/,"Moving to S Cuyler/Maddison/Ridgewood area, thoughts on the area would be super helpful!",/r/NearWestSuburbs/comments/4qv7hv/moving_to_s_cuylermaddisonridgewood_area_thoughts/d4wp1ul/,3,r/NearWestSuburbs,0,3

"I can't comment on the safety personally but my friend lived just a few blocks west of there for years and never had any issues. Also, you're not far from Freddy's in Cicero, incredible Italian food, including the best gelato in the Chicagoland area, at a very good price, I used to meet my friend there before she moved away:

"That area is perfectly safe. On South Blvd., you're going to be right across the street from the train. Noise might be an issue, but crime and danger really won't.

You will be within three blocks from a grocery store, a CVS, a public pool, and a nice pizza place. Downtown Oak Park is a five minute drive or a ten to fifteen minute walk away, and the Loop is less than half an hour on the green line. It's a pretty ideal location, IMO.
