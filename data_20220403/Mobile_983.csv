">didn't the baybears originally leave because of continuous low ticket sales or something of the sort?

Attendance did go down, but it was still averaging around 1100 people per game in 2019.  The original Huntsville Southern League team had lower attendance.  I believe the lower attendance had more to do with the Bay Bears' recent poor performance in the league than the stadium.  2015 was the last year the Bay Bears had more wins than losses.

The team claimed to leave over the aging 21 year old stadium and low sales. But it was because the team was purchased by BallCorps LLC in 2017 and Madison offered to build a new $48 million stadium with some other incentives.

Of course, Mobile has a nasty habit of spending money on infrastructure without budgeting improvements or maintenance.  They basically build it and use it until it falls apart.

My main point was that the way Mobile structured the original deal was very beneficial  to the property owners.",t2_fckzx,space_coder,0,1648816880.0,0,t1_i2z5n29,i2z5n29,False,Surge00001,t3_tszyfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileAL/comments/tszyfe/city_of_mobiles_lease_on_hank_aaron_stadium_has/,City of Mobile's lease on Hank Aaron Stadium has been voided by a technicality,/r/MobileAL/comments/tszyfe/city_of_mobiles_lease_on_hank_aaron_stadium_has/i2z5n29/,2,r/MobileAL,0,2

"Then maybe pay them.

Edit:   I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised at the downvotes.  But I’ll explain. 

I’ve spent most of my working career as a server or bartender, earning tips.  My perspective is one built on the idea that my employers pay me so very little that they should expect little in return. 

If I’m working 35 hours per week and bringing home $600-$800 per week (or more depending on the week), the $2.13/hr the restaurant/bar is paying me constitutes between 11% and 8.5% of my pay. 

So, somewhere around 90% of my pay is coming straight out of someone’s pocket or bank account, and providing them with an exceptional level of customer service is foremost on my agenda.  

However, the customers don’t write the schedule, so it also makes sense for me to at least keep my employer happy.  Usually, an exceptional level of customer service is enough to do that. 

But if you want me to care about your business at the same level that you do, maybe offer some (or any) benefits, an exceptional hourly wage, insurance, job security, investment opportunities, or anything above and beyond “but we let you make tips.”

That is pretty disgraceful. I fully understand some workers need to hear this but this will offend everyone. Workers are a reflection of management and they only do what is allowed so either A. Someone made bad decisions in hiring a manager or B. If manager is owner he /she has made horrible choices in letting the bad behavior slide. It sounds to me just based off the words in letter that leadership is lacking at this place. A leader will draw people in and they will create the team culture that very clearly is lacking. There is no way that this behavior should have been allowed to the point that this blowup of a letter happened. How about fire the people face to face if it is valid and hold people accountable for their actions because it is very clear that some workers have no fear of management disciplining them and that is a management issue so I would start the firing process there.,t2_2w605xdl,bks37seahawks,0,1648680889.0,0,t1_i2rzf6n,i2rzf6n,True,nwa747,t3_tsipbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileAL/comments/tsipbk/a_letter_from_the_management_of_spot_of_tea/,A letter from the management of Spot of Tea restaurant on Daulphin St. to employees:,/r/MobileAL/comments/tsipbk/a_letter_from_the_management_of_spot_of_tea/i2rzf6n/,16,r/MobileAL,0,16

"Thank you. Used to frequent that place whenever I was in Manitou proper. But what a neat and fascinating little town! Back in 2014 ish(?) there was a mudslide that originated from the barren land from the Waldo Canyon Fire years before that swept through Main street and destroyed a lot of businesses. Hopefully they were able to rebound. One place comes to mind on Manitou Ave is the penny arcade and hopefully this bar, The Ancient Mariner is still there and was only a couple doors down from The Mate Factor. Haven't been been back since 2008. 

The Colorado Springs area is kind of a hot bed of religious activity too. Christian mega churches like the one in the north part of the Springs is infamous for the meth-addicted super-in-the-closet (of course) gay pastor who was part of some scandal years ago.

"As someone who has been in public housing for a while, it may not be under the best conditions, but it’ll do if you really want to get on your feet.

"Live in Colorado now, where the Twelve Tribes (cult that owns The Yellow Deli) have a decent sized presence. The Denver Post has been running an ongoing investigative report on them the last few weeks. Here's an excerpt for the curious:

&#x200B;

>During its 50-year existence, the Twelve Tribes has distinguished itself among religious cults through its extensive business operations. The group has relied on food service, construction, soap-making, woodworking, farming, solar energy and even an Alaskan fishing operation to make money over the decades. Members live communally, sharing money and resources, and all of the sect’s businesses are staffed by followers who work without pay, ex-members told The Denver Post.  
>  

>New members must give the group all their possessions when they join, often signing over personal property to the cult’s limited liability companies. Many have nothing to fall back on if they later want to leave the group.  
>  

>In 26 hours of interviews with The Post, the ex-members also took issue with the Twelve Tribes’ treatment of children and the group’s teachings embracing racism, homophobia and misogyny. The Post reviewed nearly 400 pages of the cult’s internal teachings and is presenting ex-members’ accounts in a series of three stories this week.  
>  

>The Twelve Tribes’ estimated 3,000 followers live communally in about three dozen worldwide compounds. Now headquartered in North Carolina, the cult was founded in Tennessee in 1972 and made its way into Colorado in the early 2000s.  
>  

>The group has two established Colorado communities, one in Boulder County and another in Manitou Springs, and can be considered a cult because of its charismatic authoritarian leader, extremist ideology, all-or-nothing belief system, and use of coercion to control and exploit members, cult expert Janja Lalich said.",t2_rjcs0,SwindledSwine,0,1648132657.0,0,t1_i1xopbn,i1xopbn,True,LimpImagination8138,t3_tlf3o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileAL/comments/tlf3o5/controversial_yellow_deli_restaurant_confirms_new/,Controversial Yellow Deli restaurant confirms new Mobile location,/r/MobileAL/comments/tlf3o5/controversial_yellow_deli_restaurant_confirms_new/i1xopbn/,10,r/MobileAL,0,10

"There’s a really nice womens homeless shelter that opened recently on Azelea. It’s called McKimmey Place. You could look into staying there while you save money to get your own place.

"I wish I had something more to offer than this...

I was homeless in Mobile for almost two years. About a year of that was legit, only have a bicycle and live in a storage unit. The rest I either had a car or a place I could sleep on a couch semi regularly.

That was the absolute hardest time of my life. The winter living outside was fucking awful. The summer was as bad as you can imagine it would be living in a non climate controlled metal box and riding a bicycle to work. But the winter was hard.

The only advice I can give you is focus on keeping that job more than anything. Go get a membership at planet fitness for $10 a month. You can shower there 24/7. I did this. Also once it got warm outside, I know this is nasty or whatever but I would shampoo my hair up really heavily and ride my bicycle to an apartment complex that I could get into the pool at. I would basically bathe with the lather from my hair. 

The job and people you can try to meet at the job to find a room mate is your best shot. I always preferred to be alone and less physically comfortable than to be around other people I didn't feel I could trust. You can sleep in the car even if it sucks a lot. 

I say this with a lot of understanding. You are a lot more fortunate than a lot of homeless people to have a car. I had a car when I became homeless and lost it during that time. My life became significantly worse.

There are government programs to help find legitimate housing for homeless people but I honestly never tried... Housing First I believe is the name of one. I moved into a boarding house downtown on South Broad for about 6 months. That was a fucking nightmare. I didn't know what I was getting into. It was cheap though.

I read through some of your other posts and it seems like you’re serving? I’m gonna be honest with you… I know a lot of servers in Mobile and there are some restaurants where you can seemingly make $200-300 a night but not many. That’s what you need. I suggest hopping on Indeed and looking for jobs down at the beach. There are PLENTY of serving jobs that will be coming open in Gulf Shores and Orange Beach and you can make bank at just about any of them during the summer. Work your ass off for a month or so and then find a place down that way. With you living in your car right now just stick it out a bit longer if you can get one of those. Don’t sit around waiting on it though. Once summer hits they won’t be hiring like that anymore. I know you have your current job but… the opportunity for WAY more is right there at the beach.,t2_aq1miq6s,Fingyfinger,0,1647998800.0,0,t1_i1qnsw2,i1qnsw2,True,RepresentativeOld680,t3_tkgp39,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileAL/comments/tkgp39/homeless_and_need_advice/,Homeless and Need Advice,/r/MobileAL/comments/tkgp39/homeless_and_need_advice/i1qnsw2/,5,r/MobileAL,0,5

"The gist:

$252 million is the estimated costs for the new international terminal and surrounding infrastructure. So far $192 million in funding has been acquired: $162 million from feds in grants and funding as well as $30 million from the City of Mobile. If the County approves the investment, it will bring the total funding to $222 million.

"I can respect the plan you just laid out. I definitely think it has to be torn down and agree all acts at the theatre can easily be moved to the saenger theatre. In my opinion, we’re not getting major acts regularly, even with a new arena. I think it might be wiser if we just give up thinking we can do that and focus on a plan for adding a substantial amount of housing downtown to support a mix of stuff yet to come. 

For example, you can tear down the civic center and rebuild the grid system. In one of the grid’s you can put a new facility that’s like the civic center, but much smaller in footprint. This basically only functions for Mardi Gras balls. It can be used for other things, but we don’t need to be pretending we need a large arena when many other city properties(Ladd, Hank Aaron), plus south’s new stadium and the Mitchell center can hold large numbers of people. Around the new arena you build a mix of housing types that can tie into the existing church street east neighborhood. Small amounts of retail at the bottom of some of these apartments/condos can support the new influx of people as well as the existing housing further west. 

The logic is that the city is getting the most 24/7 365 production from the area with people living there, working there, and still maintaining an entertainment footprint. The city is also gonna see a significant amount of acreage open up when the interstate ramps get destroyed with the bridge project. If done right, you can swing for something like an amphitheater(similar to Huntsville’s that’s being built), hotel, etc that can be nearby the civic center development. Plus, it can directly be tied into the waterfront area like gulfquest, the cruise terminal, etc. Eventually, the writing is on the wall for the Wallace tunnel. As soon as that bridge is paid off, there’s no need for the tunnel, so you could hypothetically see a day when an expanded fort conde village-waterfront area can be stitched back into where the civic center is. That’s 30+ years out into the future, but it’s good to keep it in mind when approaching stuff like this",t2_2pd68dmw,natedoggbryars,0,1647570059.0,0,t1_i13qkal,i13qkal,False,Surge00001,t3_tgh3d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileAL/comments/tgh3d4/what_should_be_the_fate_of_the_mobile_civic_center/,What should be the fate of the Mobile Civic Center?,/r/MobileAL/comments/tgh3d4/what_should_be_the_fate_of_the_mobile_civic_center/i13qkal/,3,r/MobileAL,0,3

"My two cents: tear it down and rebuild. No private developer is making a civic center type of investment here. And that building (and the Convention Center) gets used a LOT more than people realize. 3 facilities in 1: arena, theater and expo hall. You just can't buy a ticket to every thing held there so those events don't get promoted to the public. Company trainings/meetings, Traffic Court, movie filmings, dance competitions, wrestling, tennis (yes, it's the rain site for tennis competitions), Distinguished Young Women, cheer competitions, band competitions, ballet, etc. So, people incorrectly perceive there to be nothing going on. Covid also showed a city of this size NEEDS a civic center type facility as has hurricane relief, etc, in the past.

I'd say: tear it down. It IS old and outdated. Wipe it clean and rebuild with a connected 10-12 story hotel on the corner where the train thing currently is. Remove the theater and route theater based shows to the Saenger, a MUCH better facility and also city owned. Off the hotel and along the current fence, build a nice multi story parking garage. A guest can drive in, load in to the hotel and get to a show without getting wet on a rainy day...in often the rainiest city in America. That'd be nice.

Rebuild the arena to be a 7-10,000 seat venue (currently 10k or so max), but modernized with giant screens, LED lighting and such and in the oval shape (better for acoustics). And, people seem to think if we build a 30,000 seat arena we'll get mega sized concerts but that's simply not how that industry works. At all. It's changed since the current venue was in it's heyday. And that was with no Wharf, Pensacola center or casinos gobbling up touring acts. How people consume entertainment has changed as well. Until Atlanta/New Orleans/Jacksonville and even Birmingham all shrink way down those routings of bigger shows won't change anyways. Sure, you get an Elton John once in awhile, but not often enough to justify the cost/maintenance. And our lack of civic support of every other type of tour historically doesn't help. So, we're not getting the big big stuff no matter what. I'd also like to see our venues lean more into the e-sports world and book some competitions here, but a lot of modernization is needed for that.

Rebuild the Expo Hall as a mixed use facility.

As for Mardi Gras, that IS a big concern. The Civic Center is ground zero for it. Keep the oval shape but with the extra rooms designed around the north rim of the oval, as it currently is, so Mardi Gras krewes can keep doing their thing once it reopens.

But...here's the thing. It takes FOREVER to tear down/rebuild one of these new modern venues. They'd start Ash Wednesday of 202? and it take 2 years + minimum. So...where do you put Mardi Gras for 2 years or more? Covid may have been a good warmup for the krewes to start making backup plans for the Convention Center, Cruise terminal, Brookley, Temple, etc for awhile if this rebuild occurs. 

But, I do hope it all works out well.

You should have the weekends off. Lots of meetings. Too many if you ask my opinion. I think you will ultimately enjoy being there and the pay is pretty good.

"Water Street reconstruction: This portion a water street will be reconstructed when the Mobile River Bridge and Bayway is built. This is in the Southeast portion of downtown. These plans are from 2018, although I Imagine not much has changed in the plan. The Purple and Yellow lines are realignments of roads/new roads. Purple is ground level roads and Yellow is bridges. 

In it, Water Street is reconstructed into a 6 lane boulevard between Canal Street and Government. Although since these plans were made, the rest of Water Street and Canal Street have been converted into a 4 lane boulevard with the third lane being turned into a bike lane, I imagine they will do the same with the reconstruction. The new Canal-Water Street- I10 interchange will become a diverging diamond interchange (1 of 2 that will be created in this project) 

Claiborne-Jackson Streets that run along the convention center will be destroyed and be realigned to meet up at the intersection of Water Street and Royal Street (not downtown Royal Street, but Royal Street that goes to the docks). The portion of I-10 that enters the tunnel will also get a slight realignment and will have less of a tight turn. In this you can also see where the Mobile River Bridge is gonna go in the lower portion of the picture.

When its all said and done, Downtown will have like 40 new acres of land for development

"Correct, families could use vouchers to attend public schools outside of their district. This would instill division in public schools as only those who have the means to transport their child to a better school would. Those who don't have the means to transport their child would send their child to an increasingly poor school. I agree that we need to improve and overhaul our education system. Funding is not the only factor in a school’s success, but it’s no wonder that we have poor educational outcomes when our state education funding is in the bottom 10 nationwide.

I know the story. So there’s this old lady with all these issues apparently mental and physical. And she picked up a brand new car not too long ago. Why they sold her a mustang I do not know. Anyways she thought she was reversing but she hit the gas and went through the window. She then tried leaving the scene but a few people who work a wemos had to tell her not to. She then got out of the car without shoes on and got her feet cut a little.

"taxis are almost nonexistent.  you'll have to call them, no way you'll find one to flag down

ubers are usually available, but it's nothing like if you were in a bigger city. there will be times when the first available one will be 20+ minutes (as someone who used to live in maryland, and travels a lot, it's nowhere near what you'd find in bigger cities).  and late at night, aside from friday and saturday nights, it can be hard to find one as well

lyfts are around but ubers are far more plentiful, and it's not uncommon to not be able to find a lyft

if you're downtown there's a decent electric scooter presence.  again, nothing like in a bigger city but enough to get you around downtown if it's a work thing.  beyond broad street though scooters are hard to come by

Kickball is a great way to meet new folks. Also wander downtown and see if any particular bar fits your vibe. We have quite a few diverse types. Check out the Arts Council by the Saenger Theatre.

"The Mobile Museum of Art has adult classes that might be worth checking and would be a good way to meet friends. [https://www.mobilemuseumofart.com/learn/adults/](https://www.mobilemuseumofart.com/learn/adults/)

If you are into running there is a running club out of Braided River on Thursdays at 6 pm and that is also a great way to meet people. The facebook page is ""Downtown Runners United by Beer"" if you are interested in that. 

As for volunteer organizations Feeding the Gulf Coast and Alabama Coastal Cleanup are good ones to look into.

"this just reminded me....  25+ years ago there was a dude named Prince Albert who would occasionally set up shop at the flea market, but mostly sold his plants out of his house towards downtown.
