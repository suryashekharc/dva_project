We did and would definitely recommend that hike as well. We did it on our first day at the park so was nice to take in the views driving up through the scenic highway and then across to the East Mesa Trialhead. Just FYI it was very dry when we went last May but would definitely keep an eye on any recent rainfalls because the final road to get back there could be a muddy mess.,t2_2p8agb41,kylej802,0,1647968913.0,0,t1_i1omdp7,i1omdp7,False,kylej802,t3_n1yo8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/n1yo8u/hiking_angels_landing_in_the_afternoon/,Hiking Angels Landing in the Afternoon,/r/ZionNP/comments/n1yo8u/hiking_angels_landing_in_the_afternoon/i1omdp7/,1,r/ZionNP,0,1

"You cannot drive onto Zion Canyon Scenic Rd to the Angels Landing trail head **on days the shuttle is running** (unless you have a reservation at Zion Lodge, and then you can drive to Zion Lodge a little less than a mile from the trail head).  Time of day doesn't matter, you can't drive even before the shuttles run.

However, the shuttle is only running of weekends this week, and starts daily on March 19th.  So, you **can drive to the trail head** (Grotto picnic area) any weekday this week from  today (March 7) to and including Friday (March 11).  No worries about time on these days - you can go in at 4am or 6am or 8am. Parking does fill fast in the morning and there's limited parking at Grotto, where the West Rim trail head for Angels Landing begins.

"It's 8.5 miles one-way from the visitor center to the Temple of Sinawava (end of the road) and then maybe another mile or so on Riverside Walk to the start of the Narrows.  I guess it is walkable but the road is narrow and, with more car traffic than when shuttles are running, I'm not sure you want to walk on the road.  Another option is to rent a bike or ebike in Springdale, but you have the same issue of more vehicles on the road when the shuttles aren't running.

However, you didn't ask about walking the entire road.  There's a paved multiuse path about 1 3/4mi long (one-way) called Pa'rus that goes from the visitor center area to Canyon Junction (where Zion Canyon Rd tees off of UT9).  There are official trails (Sand Bench, Emerald Pools, Grotto trails) that you can use to walk between the Court of the Patriarch pullout/viewpoint to Zion Lodge area to Grotto picnic area, so it's pretty easy to park at one of those and walk to the others.  Walking those and Riverside Walk are easy and flat and a good way to see the canyon.  Walking Pa'rus at sunset is sweet too.  Lots of people will set up cameras at the bridge at Canyon Junction for iconic sunset photos but there's some good viewing spots on Pa'rus where you don't have to deal with traffic on UT9.

It's about 1.5mi on the trail from Court of the Patriarchs to Zion Lodge and about a mile on the trail from Zion Lodge to Grotto Picnic area for a total of 2.5mi or 5mi round trip.  Obviously takes a little more time to walk than drive but once you factor in slow driving speeds and the chance you'll have to search or wait for parking, it probably doesn't sacrifice that much time and you get fresh air and views that are not framed by a car window.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1643902506.0,0,t1_hvfil4k,hvfil4k,False,jovendoc,t3_sj7dji,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/sj7dji/np_newbie_looking_to_visit_early_march/,NP newbie looking to visit early March,/r/ZionNP/comments/sj7dji/np_newbie_looking_to_visit_early_march/hvfil4k/,1,r/ZionNP,0,1

"The shuttle only serves the main Zion Canyon when it runs and there are other areas (e.g., Kolob Canyons, East Entrance side, Kolob Terrace (though some of that road will be closed due to snow)).  You need a car to visit those parts of the park regardless.

The shuttle will be running weekends only from Feb 19 to Mar 13.  You are allowed to drive a private vehicle on the scenic Zion Canyon road if you visit Zion during a weekday in that period.  Being able to drive this road is a special treat that visitors in the summer cannot enjoy.  There is a limited amount of parking (about 400 spots) available along Zion Canyon drive and the rangers will close access temporarily when they fill (so get going before 8am or wait till mid to late afternoon as people leave).

I recommend that you read [Joe's Guide](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/recommend.php) to learn about hikes, if you're interested in hiking.  As for permits, Angels Landing will require one after April 1, so you're okay in March for that one. Besides, you can still hike West Rim trail up to Scout Lookout where the Angels Landing spur trail starts and even go farther on West Rim without a permit.  Permits are needed for canyoneering, backcountry camping, Narrows top down (often a two day overnight, hiking in really cold water - don't want to do in March), and Subway (top down is technical ropes, bottom up is cold water).  Most visitors enjoy Zion without even knowing those permits exist.

You might need to bring or rent microspikes for Angels if late snow and you might have to forego the Angels Landing spur if icy/wet for safety reasons but odds are good it won't be an issue.  Definitely need to rent gear for Narrows bottom up as the water will be cold.  Likely won't be able to get to east side trail heads of East Mesa or Stave Spring unless Zion Ponderosa is running their $5/person shuttle (roads become muck if wet) but most people never venture to that side of the park.  A couple of trails are closed indefinitely due to rockfall.

"Death valley is the wrong way (west from vegas vs east to zion) and would be a mistake imo to try and cram in.

Before bryce, along the route you will pass through red canyon.  Be sure to build in time to stop and look around.

If you have extra time and the road is open, its also worth stopping at cedar breaks national monument.

Also consider coral pink sand dunes state park, pipe spring national monument, or the north rim of the grand canyon (again based on road closures due to snow) all are great easy and recommended stops in the southwest utah area.

But you don't really need these other areas (unless you like scenic drives) because its easy to do 3 days of hiking in zion and 2 in bryce. 🥰

"The road is open to private vehicles when the shuttles aren't running.  It's a rare treat to be able to drive.  However, parking is limited - I think about 400 spaces spread out over a number of places. You might have to leave early morning to ensure a spot at the trail heads, or wait till later in the day as people leave.  Totally depends on the number of visitors.  If parking is full at Grotto (Angels Landing start), it's only about a mile of easy flat trail from Zion Lodge parking to Grotto.

"I did the Angels Landing hike with a pre-dawn start recently and it might one of the best things I've ever done.

I stayed the night before at Zion Lodge (they'll let you leave your car in the lot all day even if you check out first thing in the morning).  Woke up early and (with a headlamp) proceeded to walk down the road to the trailhead (adding about 0.8 miles to the hike).  I initially thought I might have been the first person on the trail, but as I hiked along the river in the dark, I saw 2 pairs of headlamps making their way up the switchbacks ahead.  So I think I ended up being the fifth person at the top that day, but I still had the trail essentially to myself for the hike up, was able to enjoy some quiet time at the top, and never felt hassled on the way down despite hiking the opposite direction from the folks who came off of the first shuttles.

If you do it this way, I'd recommend trying to leave the lodge about an hour before sunrise - walking down the road to the trailhead and the early part of the hike are both straightforward, so a headlamp is more than enough light.  I'm sure plenty of people do, but I personally wouldn't feel comfortable doing the final climb with the chains in the dark.  I got amazing photos of sunrise sky from Scout Lookout, and then proceeded to tackle the final climb in the daylight.",t2_4t2im8fh,ChicSheikh,0,1636402900.0,0,t1_hjuhjmg,hjuhjmg,True,Key_Life6895,t3_o9kfeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/o9kfeu/narrows_angels_landing_hikes_predawn/,Narrows / Angels Landing Hikes Pre-Dawn,/r/ZionNP/comments/o9kfeu/narrows_angels_landing_hikes_predawn/hjuhjmg/,1,r/ZionNP,0,1

My biggest concern is that that definitely will take a lot of your day and around Thanksgiving, you're not gonna have much daylight. I suppose either get up early or bring a headlamp. With that, there is a pretty narrow switchback section from the Angel's Landing area up to the West Rim that hopefully is not frosty or anything around that time.

"We are just leaving Zion for the week and to be honest, I don't feel like getting on the first shuttle is as important as everyone says it is. We went to the narrows yesterday (Thursday), picked up our gear from Zion outfitter at 7:00 when it opened, and were able to hop on a shuttle right away. The line moves really fast and the most we waited all week was about 20 minutes when we got there around 9:30. I'm not sure exactly how long the bus ride is, my best guess would be 20-30 minutes since many shuttle stops are closed right now. There is also a 1 mile hike along the river before getting to the narrows. We got to the narrows around 8:30. It wasn't super crowded until we started heading back. We turned around after 2 hours (we did not make it to wall street and not sure how much farther it would have been). The way back was crowded and a little frustrating because of all of the people. It also started getting sunny at that point (around 11 maybe).  We were glad we got there as early as we did. It was definitely chilly at first though. Hope this all helps!

"I was there June 16, a Wednesday. Got there at 5am. Was on the third shuttle but was able to park in the visitor center lot (in a shaded spot too!). Took maybe 30 minutes or so to get to the Temple so we were hiking by 7am and there weren't a ton of people hiking the narrows (totally different story on our hike back, it was a mad house). Since each shuttle holds around 60 people I imagine getting there around 4/4:30 would have put us on the first shuttle. For what it's worth, I spoke with some people who arrived at 5:30, they were able to park by the visitor center but they didn't get on the shuttle until after 8am.

Also my two cents on e-bikes (because there's always the ""skip the shuttle and e-bike"" replies):
It was very hot when I was there. Biking into the canyon before/after hiking in that heat seems totally nuts unless you're in great shape and used to those temperatures.

"Do it!! We stayed at the Zion Lodge, got up at 3:30am, started hiking from the Lodge at 4:30am, with headlamps, adding a half mile to the hike. No big deal. Within an hour it was light enough to turn them off.   
It was cool, uncrowded and peaceful. We summited at 7:10am. The crowds were snaking up the chains as we descended, getting worse by the minute. Good idea not to hang out at the top for very long!!  
Something nobody talks about is your backpack. We carry a lot of water, and the packs are heavy. I opted to leave the pack at Scout's Landing and do the chains without them.

"You should be fine, fitness-wise.   
We left the Zion Lodge at 4:30am with headlamps, and were the fourth group to reach the summit at about 7:10am. HIGHLY recommend leaving this early. The hoards were behind us. This gave us time to hike up without stress, which made everything so much more enjoyable.   
The chain section takes focus and intensity. Know that the chain is not always placed in the best spot for your next step. ALWAYS be looking for handholds on the rock itself, to make certain your balance is over your feet. Sometimes you'll feel that you need to reach to the right or left to grab the chain, putting you off-balance.

Oscars which is billed as a Mexican restaurant has phenomenal burgers. I think their burgers are much better than their Mexican food. Zion Pizza & Noodle is great too.

Food is all local places in Springdale. A little expensive as to be expected but all fine. You can check menus online at Oscar’s and the other places that have already been mentioned. 

Can definitely find somewhere to lock up your bike but it might not be at the place you eat itself.

Do the Overlook hike.  Park on the right (or left) immediately after the tunnel and head up from there.   Moderate hike and nice views.  Would take about 2 hours (round trip) and could be done before sunset or to see sunset.  Hot though late day.  Or drive to Checkerboard Mesa and back just to see East Zion.  Pull the GPX for Keyhole canyon and hike up the bottom as far as you can then double back.  (It's a technical canyon so don't start from the top unless you have a permit and skills.)

"We used Zion Guide Hub for our ebike rentals. We had a really great experience. I honestly don't know how much Zion Adventures differs. I'd assume it'll be fantastic as well. If you're in Springdale, we really, really liked Deep Creek Coffee company for breakfast. It was quite possibly the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. The coffee and smoothies were on-point, too.

For Narrows, we went almost all the way up both sides of the fork. We're pretty avid hikers and it took us about 7 hours. The shuttle company had quoted us 5-6 hours. The first portion was a bit slower just b/c the slow moving crowds. We started at 9 AM, though, so it took a minute to get through some of the crowds and for it to start thinning out upstream. Plus, the whole thing is slippery so you gotta make sure you have your footing while you walk. It's a bit risky just striding out like on a normal trail. I never fell but witnessed it a good bit. Going back was a lot quicker. You just will not have any GPS so it's a good idea to get a map with pictures of some of the milestones if you're trying to watch your time and gauge where you are. It does feel like you lose time  a bit in there.

It was over 100F outside when we went. The canyon does feel more cool and you don't think about the heat as much. It's still dry heat outside (despite walking in cold water). You'll walk through shaded areas and some parts of the canyon will still get light. I had my sunglasses on and off throughout. I had 3L of water on me and I was about out when I got back to the trailhead. Luckily, there is water station and bathrooms at trailhead.

In terms of distance from the lodge to trailhead, I'm not sure. We took a private shuttle for the Narrows. Then, we did e-bikes for Angels Landing. The nice thing with the e-bikes is you can go full bore on the pedal assist and just fly. I hit 30 MPH before I realized it. So, it's pretty quick. You do have to be mindful of the park shuttles and pull over whenever they pass. I would imagine you're less than 30 minutes from temple of sinawava from the lodge, though...it depends how fast y'all are! There's ample space to lock up your e-bikes at all the trailheads.

If you're trying to eat out, we liked River Rock Brewing Co. about 30 min south of Springdale. The place has great coffee, pizza and some local brews. The patio overlooks a valley and the patio is shaded. 

If you have the option to get canyoneering boots for the Narrows, I'd recommend it. We used kayak shoes and hiking poles. I don't think you need their wood poles, although some walking stick is helpful. The canyoneering boots just have a thicker sole and ankle support. We did have neoprene socks and thought those were helpful.

I'd also recommend something to keep your phone/camera dry and still use it. Plus, we had dry bags for snacks and random stuff. The only time the water got too deep was towards the end of the left side. There's a section where most people are up to their chest. However, you could fall anytime and then you'll be wet.

"Thank you so much!

I was speaking with someone from zion adventures, will likely grab bikes that evening so they're ready for the trek in the morning.  Are all the rental shops fairly similar / would you recommend this one?

For the narrows, if we left our lodge around 6am, would we arrive around 630/645? Then approximate four hours out & back (at least a bit past the fork)... does that sound about right? It's also quite shaded / cool (well, cooler than 100F) correct? The path from the lodge to temple of sinawava is the 'scenic route' correct?

"You could probably check out Emerald Pools the first day. Otherwise, it's a really pretty bike ride to ride those bikes down to the visitors center and back. There's also a little brewery just past the visitor center right in Springdale just as you exit the park. We did the ebikes last week and it was awesome.

6 am is probably fine for the Narrows. The crowds thin out a lot as you get closer to the fork. If you're in shape and up for it, I really encourage you to be efficient to the fork and take your time enjoying / taking photos after the fork and then coming back. The right side is more adventerous. The left side is very photogenic. Both are great.

"I am going to go against the grain on timing. We just did this last week. We got some advice from locals to wait until \~1 to start. It was hot going up. We just took our time. Catch your breathe as you go. However, the crowds were mostly gone when we got up there. It was pretty sparse on the cables. When we came down, the shuttles run to \~8 and it was just nice and chill.

It's good you've got plenty of water. There is also a water station and bathroom right across the road from the trailhead.

I'll add to bring some gloves for the chains. At least, you'll probably want some hand sanitizer when you're done. Also, I'd encourage you to think about wearing shoes with good grip.

The first set of chains is the worst. The second set is not as bad, despite how it might seem when you're finishing the first set. That said, if you chicken out, I'd encourage you to go back to the bathrooms at the start of Scout's landing and go up West Rim trail for a bit. It's 3 miles but you can walk up a bit and turn back around whenever. It'll provide some great views w/o quite the death defying fear that creeps up on some people. Plus, hardly anyone keeps going up there.

Mostly, just take your time, hydrate, & have a blast!",t2_15zy3r,pineapplemangoapple,0,1624376105.0,0,t1_h2ntt6h,h2ntt6h,True,Anon23100321,t3_o5dxjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/o5dxjb/tips_for_angels_landing_please/,Tips for Angel’s Landing - Please,/r/ZionNP/comments/o5dxjb/tips_for_angels_landing_please/h2ntt6h/,3,r/ZionNP,0,3
"The timing tip is really the winner.  The part before the switchbacks is just in the baking sun.  That was the least enjoyable part of the hike for me, and I did it in the heat of midday.  The switchbacks were a relief when I got to them because there was some shade in the area.  The switchbacks are short, and they are a good change of pace in the hike.  The earlier part of the hike was a bit boring and (for me at least) was very much a just-keep-swimming mentality.  Once I hit the switchbacks, the hike became enjoyable.

I think my whole experience would have been different if the sun were not bearing down so hard, so go early sounds like great advice.",t2_ardp1,melonlollicholypop,0,1624372310.0,0,t1_h2nlmk7,h2nlmk7,False,Anon23100321,t3_o5dxjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/o5dxjb/tips_for_angels_landing_please/,Tips for Angel’s Landing - Please,/r/ZionNP/comments/o5dxjb/tips_for_angels_landing_please/h2nlmk7/,2,r/ZionNP,0,2
"You'll be fine.  It's not that long of hike.  Maybe add climbing your stairs 20 times in a row or more (assuming you have stairs at home or nearby) to your daily routine just get your legs ready.  Going down stairs is as important as going up.

Don't use trekking poles on this hike if you haven't used them before.  You don't really need them as the trail is essentially paved the entire way.  If you do use trekking poles, shorten the poles to match the inclines. Otherwise they'll probably make things more uncomfortable.

Tips - Go early before the heat and crowds.  If you can afford to rent a bike or bring one, try to get to the trail head at dawn or earlier.  It's only a 5mi ride from the visitor center.  Parking at the visitor center will likely fill before 8am - another reason to get going early or to ride a bike.  Keep a steady pace, stay hydrated, rest only long enough to catch your breath.

The chain section to the Angels Landing spur starts once you get to Scout Lookout after the Walters Wiggles switchback.  Trust your judgement if you think it's too crowded and, if you didn't get an early start, you'll get a good chance to practice your patience.  Recommend continue down West Rim trail a little bit to more view after you do Angels Landing - crowds really thin.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1624368708.0,0,t1_h2nedor,h2nedor,True,Anon23100321,t3_o5dxjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/o5dxjb/tips_for_angels_landing_please/,Tips for Angel’s Landing - Please,/r/ZionNP/comments/o5dxjb/tips_for_angels_landing_please/h2nedor/,2,r/ZionNP,0,2

"I wore shorts and a sports bra. I’m from Ohio where it’s humid and it’s still *hot* in UT even with a dry heat. Walking around in a sweaty t shirt didn’t seem enjoyable for me. Long sleeves sound terrible actually but I’m sure I saw one or two people. I’d say it depends on your skip type.

"I think you're misunderstanding a lot of stuff here.

1. The park doesn't buy billboards. Parks don't do that. The state tourism board might, or local businesses, but parks don't advertise themselves like that. They don't have a budget for that. If the state tourism board decides to buy a billboard, there's nothing the park can do about it.
2. The park does want to limit the number of people that can enter, but local and state politics have prevented them from doing so. Business interests trump visitor experience in Utah. For instance, the park implemented the shuttle ticket system to limit visitation a little bit during COVID, and right before Memorial Day Utah Senator Mike Lee put a bunch of pressure on the park service to open all of Zion back up. The park didn't want to, they were forced to. 
3. Almost nobody buys park passes ahead of their trip. They either have an annual pass already, or they buy their pass upon arriving to the park. So the park has no way of predicting how many people will be there next weekend. Before EVERY busy holiday weekend they issue a press release stating an estimate (based on previous years visitation) for how many people there will be, and to expect long lines. But it gets buried, people come anyways. 

The parks monthly visitation for every month over the last 30 years is readily available online. The park is told not to advertise that, to protect business interests. But it is online. 

The state and local governments, and local businesses, see the park as a golden goose, providing endless tourism that leads to profitable restaurants, hotels, guide shops, etc. And yes, it is that also. But they don't see it as a preserved landscape for all generations to enjoy, and seek solitude in.

"I gotta agree with you. It’s our first time at the park and it’s been pretty busy. Sunday and Monday have been the busiest days. Granted it is the busy season. My boyfriend and I also did angels landing on Monday. We got in line for the shuttle at 5:45 am and waited an hour in line. Made it to the top of angels landing by 9:30 am. It was crazy how many people were trying to make the trek. By the time we were coming down around 10:30, people at Scouts Landing were saying they had been waiting an hour to go up the final half mile. Unfortunately, there is no room on angels landing to handle the growing crowds. I don’t blame the people at the Scout’s for being upset. I had read that the Park Rangers had limited 120 people at a time for several previous weekends. I was expecting them to continue this but I guess not. Some hikers also suck and are unwilling to work together to try and make the whole ordeal run safely and smoothly. I’m glad we got up as early as we did. Allegedly, people had been waiting in the parking lot since 4:30 am to get in line for the shuttle.

"I think the problem is a lot of rich young Californians are buying vacation homes or Airbnb’s.

I think she was happy owning a small hotel with her husband and would give up the full bookings to get things back to a more manageable condition.

"I had a very different experience only a few weeks ago (late May) -- I wonder if it's due to the removal of the shuttle pass system?

My 2 day visit was on a Friday and Saturday. We entered the park at 6:30am with minimal waiting. Shuttle wait time was <10 minutes in the morning. We didn't do Angels Landing (afraid of heights) but did The Narrows on the first day. There were a few points during the hike that we had the trail seemingly to ourselves, and overall there was a very manageable amount of people.

In the afternoons, obviously, the crowds increased. Still nothing TOO crazy, but I was happy we started out early every day. The longest we waited for a shuttle was about 40 minutes at 3pm one day.

When returning to the main entrance, we saw the line for the shuttle after the ticketed times ended (anyone could enter after 3pm I think). I was astonished by how crowded it was.

The pass system does obviously limit access, and we ended up with an early ticket only 1 of the 2 days.

"Agree, overpopulation in general is depressing. Zion and Yosemite are both painfully crowded, and it can detract from the majesty and serenity of the areas. 

The way I see it, it comes with the territory of going to the major national parks. If your goal is to do exciting, famous hikes like angel’s landing, the narrows, half dome, etc., then you have to accept the crowds. 

Remember, people literally wait in line at the summit of Everest while freezing and running out of oxygen, surrounded by shit, corpses, and piles of trash. It’s horrible.

"They’re saying they reached her on Sunday, she died shortly after they reached her “according to their statement”. That’s not 5-8 hours. I read an article I believe on www.thespectrum.com mentioning it had to do with the gear or straps (what her friends are thinking happened), I am not an expert in hiking or in Zion, looks like you know more than me.
Regarding first aid, you think if there was severe bleeding, applying a patch to stop it so she won’t lose extra blood wouldn’t help?
She wasn’t all the way through the canyon, it’s 8 hours if you go back and forth, she was on a higher ground but around two miles from the beginning of The Narrows trail, if you add the Riverside walk, that’s 3 miles.
I am sure SAR did what they could given what they have, if they equip them with better technologies, they could do it more efficiently, that’s what I am trying to say.
The video I took she was exactly above us, the hiker who was shouting down and found her said she was right there next to him.

"She just fell due to mechanical issue with her rope and sustained injuries, was found by another hiker and he found her almost passed out. I was surprised that it took them a whole day to reach her. The video we recorded was around 2:30 PM on Saturday, they recovered the body on Sunday. Looks like she was experienced and this was an accident on a rather easy trail for her (Mystery Canyon).
I had a drone but unfortunately it’s not allowed to use it, I would’ve been able to locate her and even drop some supplies (First Aid) to the hiker who found her to assist. Too bad that in this age, the park rangers still use 60 years old technologies for their search and rescue operations.

"We had an annual pass but I can’t recall anyone checking our pass before parking or boarding the shuttle. I suspect this is because we arrived before the visitor’s center opened. When we left the visitor’s center/park, nobody checked for our pass then either (at other parks, even if you miss paying the entrance fee at the beginning they still check when you leave). At Bryce, they checked for our annual pass before boarding the park shuttle so I would guess that if you take one of the free Springdale shuttles going to the visitor’s center, they might check for your pass/ticket then.",t2_9rlv0s4,pineandsky,0,1622659149.0,0,t1_h0cfpiw,h0cfpiw,False,pineandsky,t3_npop84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/npop84/trip_report_memorial_day_weekend/,Trip Report: Memorial Day Weekend,/r/ZionNP/comments/npop84/trip_report_memorial_day_weekend/h0cfpiw/,1,r/ZionNP,0,1
"I can’t speak to how comfortable the rented boots are but I personally didnt mind walking around with wet shoes and shorts after the narrows, since it was a hot day and we dried off fairly quickly. There is also a place at the narrows shuttle stop where you can easily rinse off your shoes and feet if you are concerned about the algae bloom. Also note that it looked like there were water filling stations at each shuttle stop and the water tasted great! I would think carrying around the sticks might get annoying - I’m not sure what kind of sticks Zion guru provides but it looked like everyone I saw who has on rented gear had the same bulky wooden stick - if that’s the same one Zion guru provides, then I’d imagine it’d be annoying to carry around on your ebike. I wouldn’t let my semi-negative experience at the narrows bum you out. I think if you have the proper water boots then youd be able to move around more deftly and quickly in the water. It looked like others in the narrows were walking around with ease so I suspect that’s the case. I was also probably walking in the water more cautiously than others since I witnessed the woman take such a hard and unexpected fall. In terms of what to do after the narrows, I think others might be able to speak to that better but I personally really enjoyed the angels landing hike. Only thing to consider is the crowds. If too crowded and/or you don’t want to deal with the chains, I would still recommend hiking up to Scout’s and skipping the Angels Landing portion - you can skip the line at the beginning (the ranger said at peak times there can be over 250 ppl in line waiting to do the Angels Landing hike) and avoid the chains and potential overcrowding and still take in some beautiful views. 

For the scenic drive, I believe that’s a different route from what the shuttles take inside the park. From my understanding cars aren’t allowed to drive into the park where the shuttles go, but they are normally allowed for purposes of going through the Zion-Carmel tunnel/scenic drive and going to other spots like East Mesa. It sounds like this is the first time where the rangers prevented cars from going into the park for the latter purposes, at least from the hours of 8am-6pm. This might be Memorial Day specific or a go-forward park policy. I would try calling the park’s info line and asking them for clarification on this.",t2_9rlv0s4,pineandsky,0,1622658657.0,0,t1_h0cej1n,h0cej1n,False,pineandsky,t3_npop84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/npop84/trip_report_memorial_day_weekend/,Trip Report: Memorial Day Weekend,/r/ZionNP/comments/npop84/trip_report_memorial_day_weekend/h0cej1n/,1,r/ZionNP,0,1

"Incredibly informative and very helpful. We are heading out soon, arriving on the 6th. The plan is to hike the narrows on the 7th, something I've wanted to do my entire life. Your review kind of brought me down a few pegs, I hope it's not as unpleasant as it sounded. We actually have e-bikes that day, and are planning on riding up to narrows. Since we are on bike you have a recommendation for something after the narrows? Did you feel you needed to get dried off like right away because of the algae bloom? We are renting boots and poles from Zion guru, I'm just wondering if it's okay to continue hiking in those after being in the water for a couple of hours or is it better to get back to the base and put on some regular hiking shoes.

I'd suggest the Kolob Canyons - Cedar Breaks route since your legs are tired and it's a pretty good ratio of drive time to scenic wonder time.  Timber Creek Overlook is hardly a hike but you really should do that and the scenic drive in Kolob Canyons so you can see another park of Zion.  Cedar Breaks also has a couple short little hikes but you might want to bring some long sleeves as the place is at 10000ft and it can be windy and cool even if it's 90+ in Springdale.  It might be worth trying to make a loop and get into the east entrance after you hike Observation Pt since the east side of Zion is a spectacular drive and you'd have an opportunity to hike Canyon Overlook. You'd also exit the big tunnel to a wonderful view as the sun goes down.,t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1622384906.0,0,t1_gzz7c62,gzz7c62,False,pineandsky,t3_no2m83,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/no2m83/how_to_get_to_observation_point_from_st_george/,How to get to Observation Point from St George,/r/ZionNP/comments/no2m83/how_to_get_to_observation_point_from_st_george/gzz7c62/,2,r/ZionNP,0,2

For those looking for info on how shuttles are running right now (Memorial Day weekend), it’s been unexpectedly super smooth. We got to the Visitor Center at 530am on Friday with no shuttle tickets and were able to easily park but noticed the lot was 80% full at that time, and only waited until 6:15 to get on a shuttle. The shuttles are running constantly and we were always able to get on one as soon as we waited at a stop (never had to wait for the next one due to the first one being full). Bryce’s shuttles have been similarly smooth, frequent and efficient, and the shuttle drivers are incredibly nice and informative. Really impressed with Utah’s park system!",t2_9rlv0s4,pineandsky,0,1622384261.0,0,t1_gzz67gm,gzz67gm,False,pineandsky,t3_no2m83,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/no2m83/how_to_get_to_observation_point_from_st_george/,How to get to Observation Point from St George,/r/ZionNP/comments/no2m83/how_to_get_to_observation_point_from_st_george/gzz67gm/,1,r/ZionNP,0,1
"Going to restrain myself from making fun of your map reading skills.... since there's a couple of fun scenic routes that you can take.

The shortest one that's only about 25 to 30 minutes longer (maybe even quicker than going through Springdale considering potential backup in Springdale and at the tunnel when busy) is to start on the route to Zion by taking UT9 off of I15.  Turn onto UT59 at Hurricane and drive towards Hildale/Colorado City (some interesting hikes down there if you're okay with sand - check Alltrails or other website).  Note that UT59 turns to AZ389 when entering AZ.  Go south a few miles to, I believe it's called Cane Beds Rd (google has it as 237).  Follow that as it changes to route 43 as you reenter UT and go past Coral Pink Sand Dunes State park and continue on towards US89 just south of Mt Carmel Junction.  [Coral Pink Sand Dunes](https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/coral-pink/) is pretty cool for a leg stretch - you can ATV or sandboard there, though I don't know if anyone is renting at the the park this year. The last time I was on that route over a year ago, the paved road was pretty rough a couple of places because of flood damage and there were probably 200 mule deer near the road (at dusk).  It's also a narrow, winding, low to no shoulder kind of road. Go to Mt Carmel Junction on US89 and turn west on UT9 towards the east entrance of Zion.  You'll turn north on North Fork County Rd towards Zion Ponderosa.  You've gone too far on UT9 if you hit the east entrance.  Note that you drive into the Zion Ponderosa property to find the roads to the East Mesa and Stave Spring trailheads.  /u/BoWeiner is correct in that the [Stave Spring Route](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/observation-point-via-stave-spring-trailhead#:~:text=Observation%20Point%20via%20Stave%20Spring%20Trailhead%20is%20a%2011.2%20mile,is%20primarily%20used%20for%20hiking.&text=This%20route%20is%20a%20great%20alternative%20to%20reach%20Observation%20Point.) is more interesting but it is a tougher out-and-back.  If you want to get to Stave Spring and the signs are there, follow the ones that say Cable Mt and not the ones that say Observation.

The other, longer route, brings you past some pretty cool stuff.  First go up I15 towards Cedar City and stop at [Kolob Canyons](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/kolob-canyons.htm) on the way there.  At a minimum, do Timber Creek Overlook but also consider Middle Fork of the Taylor.  At Cedar City, turn west on [scenic UT14](https://lasvegasweekly.com/news/2015/apr/02/utah-state-route-14-scenic-highway-road-everywhere/) towards US89.  You'll drive past [Cedar Breaks](https://www.nps.gov/cebr/index.htm) and that should be a must stop too.  After hitting US89, turn south towards Mt Carmel Junction and follow the directions from there that I already gave.  This route adds an hour driving time but plan on 4 to 6 wall clock depending what you do en route.

Edit:  I don't know if they'll have rangers checking but, technically, you need to have a park entrance pass ($35 for 7 days) or an America the Beautiful National Park annual pass ($80 for a year) to be on the trails even though you didn't go past an entrance station.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1622378498.0,0,t1_gzyx8s6,gzyx8s6,True,pineandsky,t3_no2m83,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/no2m83/how_to_get_to_observation_point_from_st_george/,How to get to Observation Point from St George,/r/ZionNP/comments/no2m83/how_to_get_to_observation_point_from_st_george/gzyx8s6/,2,r/ZionNP,0,2

"The watchman trail is right by the visitor center and is fun and provides some good views.

You'll definitely want to head over to the east side, which doesn't require the shuttles, just for the drive even if you don't do the hike out to observation point from the east mesa trailhead like the other poster mentioned. The canyon overlook is just past the tunnel and a good short hike with an incredible view at the end.

I did the narrows via e bike and got there around 10am and it was super easy and not as crowded as so many think you need to go at the crack of dawn. 9-10am or later for narrows is still fine it’s just hotter later in the day due to less shade in the canyon than early on but you’re in water. I have no idea why people tell everyone to rush at 6am to hike the narrows as that’s when it is most crowded. You’re still fine later in the day.

"Just don't get the water in your mouth, shower off when you're done and you should be fine. If it was really dangerous, I imagine the park would close the trail.

I understand wanting to save money. However, there are lots of rocks under that water, most of which you can't see, and many of which move. To have an enjoyable and safe hiking experience, you really want to have closed toe shoes that have excellent grip.

So many pros to the lodge:
-Can drive into and out of the park whenever. 
-No need to worry about parking. 
-Shuttle is more lax. 
-Walking distance to trails including angels landing. 
-24 hour access to the park. 
-Can go back to room during day without worrying about being allowed back into the park. We hiked the narrows and got to shower up after and continue our day in the park
-Was half the price as staying in Springdale

Oh they provide you with locks and you can lock them up at almost any trailhead along the fence. Super easy. I agree shuttles are a pain in the ass. We used the shuttle only to familiarize ourselves the first day with where we wanted to go. We just packed our shoes for the narrows in our backpack along with lunch and snacks and plenty of water. There is a little market outside the front of the market with all sorts of things you can load up on. And there are water stations all over to refill.

"We took the shuttle this past Tuesday, May 11. We had 6 tickets for the 8:00 - 9:00 boarding time. We arrived at 8:45 and boarded right away without a line. 

Those with a 9:00-10:00 boarding time were allowed to line up 15 minutes early at 8:45. There were probably 50 people waiting in line at 8:45 (so that they could board the shuttle at 9:00). 

So, seems like the earlier you go in your time slot, the more people will be waiting in line. My advice would be to go around 8:30-8:45. If you’re super eager and want to be on that 8:00 shuttle, show up at 7:40 and be prepared to line up at 7:45.

There were tons of shuttles. They arrived every 3-5 minutes. So I’m sure even that 50 person line moved quickly. 

Even on our multiple stops throughout the park we never waited for a shuttle.

"I was there 3 weeks ago. They sell shuttle tickets 6 weeks in advance (check the website for accuracy), but I planned a last minute trip and was unable to purchase those. Our only other option for shuttle tickets was to wait until 5pm MTN the day prior when tickets go on sale. So I had my 2 friends and I all use our phones to attempt to get 2 different time slots (7-8a, 8-9a). When the time literally hit 5, we all attempted to purchase the tickets- I was the only one successful. They both received error messages that the tickets were sold out for their attempted time slots. The great thing was that I was able to purchase tickets for 7 people at once. We got lucky the first day, and ended up getting 11-12p the next day.

We did not have a difficult time getting on the shuttles either time slot, but capacity at that time was limited due to the pandemic. I’m not sure if anything has changed since then, but If you’re one of the last stops for the shuttle to pick up, it may be full so it gets harder to jump on and you’ll have to wait for the next one.

Good luck and hope you have an amazing time!

"If you’re looking for somewhere kinda romantic and off the beaten path, check out Under Canvas! It’s luxury glamping and it is amazing (but very pricey). If you’re not afraid of heights, highly recommend doing angels landing. The narrows are also fantastic. Since you’ll be there during peak time, you’ll want to get an early start for both of those trails if you do them. I would recommend getting shuttle tickets if you can because it really is the easiest way to get around the canyon. If you can’t swing that, rent bikes from Zion Cycle in Springdale. I used them earlier this year and they were great to work with. The main canyon is pretty easy to bike if you’re in decent shape.

"The overlook is Northgate Peaks trail.  It's actually really close to wildcat canyon trailhead and is an easy 2 mile hike each way of leaving from that trailhead.  It is only 1 mile off the wildcat canyon trail if you are thru hiking it anyway, so is a very easy add on.  The view is fantastic and covers a large swath of the Zion Backcountry on the west side.

"You definitely want to look at the trans-zion trek.   Start at Kolob Canyon and end at east rim trailhead for the full continuous experience.  If you want it a bit easier, start at Kolob canyon, end at the base of Angel's Landing, then start at east rim trailhead and end in the canyon again.  There is an overlook in the back country that is short 1 mile hike off of wildcat canyon trail that you definitely need to do.

That shouldn't take that long 3.5 days was about my estimate if you are quick on it.  No more than 5 days if you go slow.

Definitely do some shorter hikes like emerald pools, hike into the desert area where there is petrified forest..  I'd spend a whole day doing these hikes.  

Spend another day hiking into the narrows, assuming you have good water conditions.  

After that, I would suggest driving through Utah and checking tout the other parts.  Moab, arches, antellope canyon, Bryce Canyon.  Those are amazing locations.

"The longest continuous trail you can do is to spend a few days doing the zion traverse (https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/zion-traverse-lee-pass-to-east-rim-trailhead--2) and include angels landing but instead of the east rim trail (a section was destroyed by rockfall) go South from the Grotto to hit emerald pools and the patriarchs.

""Thank you for your inquiry,  

Permitting for the North Fork of the Virgin River (The Narrows) and it's tributaries will resume on 5/6/2021. 

* Wilderness permits for top-down, 16-mile trips through the Virgin River Narrows, and its tributaries (canyoneering routes) may only be obtained in person at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center Wilderness Desk during normal [**Hours of Operation**](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/hours.htm). 
* A **DANGER** **ADVISORY** has been issued for the North Fork of the Virgin River based on the concentration of cyanotoxins. Visitors are encouraged to avoid all contact with the water until further notice. [**Click here for more information.**](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/toxic-cyanobacteria-bloom-in-the-virgin-river-and-the-streams-of-zion-national-park.htm) 
* All Wilderness permit holders should be aware that there may be a risk of cyanotoxin exposure when recreating in water in Zion.  In remote Wilderness areas, current cyanotoxin conditions may be unknown.  Cyanotoxins may cause illness and/or death if ingested or absorbed through an opening in the skin.  The risk of exposure increases during and immediately after any precipitation events.  Do not drink from instream water; no known filtration methods are effective at reducing toxin levels safe for drinking. 
* Big Spring is a reliable source for obtaining water and, like all other natural springs in the park, its water should always be properly treated.

"I’ve done the top down twice. It is the only way to see the whole canyon. Upstream hiking is not allowed past about mile 4. I forget the name of the falls, but there is a landmark that you can’t go past. 

Bring a water filter, and you don’t have to carry all your water.

"We were at Zion last weekend and it was great!  I wasn’t sure if we’d end up making it bc of the shuttle and campground issues…the scheduling system makes it SO hard!  It’s like, you have to do these different things in different dates at certain times and it’s just a headache.  While researching I came across a thread that mentioned Campflare.com…I immediately went on and put in a campsite notification for Watchman Campground (the campground that books 6 months in advance).  That was a Thursday afternoon, and by 10 pm that night I had a reservation!  You do have to act QUICKLY once you get the text that a campsite is available, bc they go fast.  Our plan was to get shuttle and (South) campsite reservations the next morning (Friday the 16th) but since we already had gotten the Watchman site, all we had to get Friday morning was the shuttle tickets.  Worked great.  Also, I’ll note that I didn’t immediately turn off the notification for campsite availability and the next weekend (which was a week out from our trip) I got approximately 25 notifications of campsite openings.  My guess is that for Watchman (again, it’s booked 6 months ahead) that people confirm reservations a week before and that a lot of people had had plans change?  Idk, I just know that on the 22nd and 23rd I got a TON of notifications of available campsites.

"If the Narrows is the most important thing on your 'in-canyon' itinerary, then I agree you should do that on Day 1 with the 7am shuttle ticket. I think it's absolutely worth the experience regardless of how far you go, I was just trying to give some gauge of how long things take. The only thing I would add about your day 1 is that if you want to do Angels Landing, or even just the hike to Scout's lookout before the 0.5 mile ascent to Angels,  that'd be a more 'critical to get there early' thing to do using the 7am shuttle. While the Narrows certainly gets crowded later in the day, the backup on Angel's will be much more significant (Narrows is much wider given the river and there really won't ever be a backup). Lastly, just a reminder that if you're renting gear for the narrows you'll need to figure out what to do with it following the river if you plan to change or something and head to the Grotto shuttle stop for Emerald pools like you mentioned above.",t2_73axqo1f,RJR2393,0,1620073263.0,0,t1_gwtpgit,gwtpgit,False,RJR2393,t3_n41uvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/n41uvd/postzion_thoughts/,Post-Zion Thoughts,/r/ZionNP/comments/n41uvd/postzion_thoughts/gwtpgit/,1,r/ZionNP,0,1

"Thanks so much for your advice. We were originally leaning towards Observation Point because some friends told us it is 1) less crowded than AL and 2) a higher viewpoint. Unfortunately the trail from Weeping Rock is closed due to rockfall so if we hike it we'd have to come at it from a different trailhead (East Mesa) which I haven't read too much about.

I think we're all sold on The Narrows, everyone we have talked to has said it is amazing and very different from the other hikes.

"Was there for about a day and a half and did Canyon Overlook, Angel's Landing, Emerald Pools, Watchman, and Narrows. Canyon overlook is very quick and easy with nice views. Emerald Pools was great and also pretty quick and easy, and located right next to Angel's landing so you can do that around the same time. 

I can't speak for Observation Point since I didn't do it but my understanding is that you ultimately get a similar view to Angel's (just higher up). If you like the thrill of being on the edge on Angel's, maybe just do that, but if thats not your thing then maybe just do Observation Point.

"Hi, just got back from Zion a couple weeks ago. A couple thoughts:  
1) Parking at the visitor center can be pretty competitive. Remember you can also park in Springdale, and then either walk or ride the Springdale shuttle to the park entrance. This might be easier depending on the day of the week and when you get to the park.

2) If you're trying to line up for tickets then you're going to want to get there early. I boarded a shuttle at around 1:00 PM and the line for tickets was already massive! Remember you can always try to get shuttle tickets the day before at 5:00 PM Mountain time. I was on the shuttle ticket website at 5:00 PM exactly and was able to snag 2 tickets for 1:00 PM the next day. Buying tickets to the shuttle is kind of like buying concert tickets. If you can have 2 phones or computers trying to buy at the same time, right at 5:00, then you might get lucky. 

You can take a shuttle from the Narrows trailhead back to the park entrance free of charge. The last shuttle away from The Narrows leaves at 7:00 PM every night. If you miss the last shuttle you'll have to walk to the park entrance, which might take a couple hours.

3) You can rent wader pants, hiking sticks, and special boots at the park entrance if you're doing the Narrows. This is recommended because the water can get to be about waist-high, depending how deep you go. I saw a lot of people wearing these.

4) Getting to The Narrows, you take the river walk footpath (which is about 1 mile, or 30 mins walk,) and then you just sort of walk into the river and keep walking until you decide to turn around. It'll take as long as you want.

5) Plenty of other small hikes in and around the area if you're going to have some time in the morning.

"There's only one road in the park you can't drive on with a private vehicle and that's the one into the main canyon where the shuttle runs.  That road gets you to the iconic hikes like Angels and Narrows.  However, you can drive UT9 through the park past Canyon Junction (where the scenic canyon drive T's off) up the switchbacks and through the tunnel to the east side.  Highly recommend you do that and try to hike Canyon Overlook trail (limited parking - you might have to go east a bit past the tunnel exit and pull a u-ey to park on the other side of the road at pullouts and then walk a bit to the trail).

The dirt roads to East Mesa can be impassable when wet and pretty rutted when not.  The ruts are why high clearance is recommended but you can get back with a sedan if it's dry and you're really careful.  Scan through some of the comments on the alltrails link I posted on my first comment for East Zion trail head to see what people are saying about current conditions (and definitely ask the rangers or the folks at Zion Ponderosa about road conditions when you get there if you try the hike).

You can also drive up Kolob Terrace Rd and the Kolob Canyons area to other hikes - check Joes Guide to Zion but I think you might like Northgate Peaks off of Kolob Terrace.

My opinion is that biking is better than shuttle because you get to set your own pace, have 360^o views the entire time, etc., and it's not a difficult ride even with non-electric bikes.  So, don't worry if you can't get shuttle tickets the day prior.  And, if you can't find bike rentals and can't get shuttle tickets, I'd still go wait in line at 2pm for the walk-up shuttle rides and hike Angels in the afternoon.  Angels will be crowded at that time and it will be hotter (bring water) but crowds actually start to thin in late afternoon.  Just make certain you are back down before the second-to-last shuttle just in case it gets full.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1619644237.0,0,t1_gw7xem8,gw7xem8,False,[deleted],t3_n0nyiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/n0nyiy/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/ZionNP/comments/n0nyiy/deleted_by_user/gw7xem8/,2,r/ZionNP,0,2

"You buy the park pass on Wednesday and it's good for the 7 days.

You don't need the shuttle for Observation Pt because you can't get to Observation Pt from Weeping Rock in the main canyon.  That trail is closed due to rock fall.

"I'd do Angels on the day you have the earliest shuttle tickets.

Glad that you're checking [current flow rate](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/ut/nwis/uv?cb_00060=on&cb_00065=on&format=gif_stats&period=60&begin_date=&end_date=&site_no=09405500) on the river.

Currently, each line between 20cfs and 100cfs is a 10cfs step increase and it went from about 40cfs to 70cfs to about 55cfs (looking at 6:30am MDT 4/28 snapshot).  Anything over 100cfs will be challenging and it gets closed when it goes greater than 150cfs.  Must have been some snow in the last couple days at higher elevation because [the Kolob snow](https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reportGenerator/view/customSingleStationReport/daily/561:ut:SNTL/-7,0/WTEQ::value,SNWD::value,PREC::value,TOBS::value,TMAX::value,TMIN::value,TAVG::value) monitor jumped about a foot in depth.  Right now it's looking somewhat good for being open on May 8th but keep an eye on both monitors like you have - looks like 70/80s for the next 10 day highs with little chance of rain.

If you have a chance and the time, look at hikes outside the main canyon.  Canyon Overlook will be busy and parking can be a challenge but just driving up the switchbacks and going thru the tunnel to the east entrance is better use of time than Sandbench.  Plus you can get out and explore some of the unmaintained trails with a lot fewer people around.

You can park outside the front gates of the town if you can’t find parking inside the park but we had no issues parking at the visitor center but to get to any of the trail heads you must have shuttle tickets, e bike, or an outfitter drop you off. You do not want to walk it especially in the heat. We got to Zion cycles around 8:30, biked up to the narrows and we’re back down by 1pm. We brought snacks and plenty of bottle water with us.

"[Joe's Guide](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/recommend.php) has good descriptions of the hikes and is a good online source for first-time visitors.

Most of the hikes in Zion don't involve big cliffs.  You might be fine on some of the popular ones that do have cliffs, depending on how strong the fear.  

[Canyon Overlook](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/canyon-overlook-trail) has railings and you can stay back from the cliffs but there are a couple short sections where you'd be saying ""nope"".  You could try starting out with the family if youre ok with the stairs/railings at the start.  Since it's a short hike, you could soak in the views while waiting at the car or do a little exploring on your own of [Gifford Canyon](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/giffordcanyon.php).

Angel's Landing is a definite ""nope"" for anyone with a fear of heights.  However, if you think you can manage being back 5 or 6 feet from the edge, you could try to go with everyone up to Scout Lookout and wait for them there while they do the edgy part.  The trail is wide and essentially paved up to Scout.  I'd start out on this one with them and go as far as you're comfortable and then turn around and take your time going back, maybe hike part of Kayenta or Grotto while you wait for all to return.

The other big drop off hike is Observation Pt.  Can't get there from Weeping Rock anymore because the trail is closed due to rock fall.  You can still get there from [East Mesa](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/east-mesa-trail-to-observation-point) if the roads are good and that route doesn't entail drop off till the end (where there's enough space to stand back and feel comfortable).

"You cannot drive a private vehicle to the trail heads for Narrows and Angel's Landing.  You have to have the $1 advance park shuttle tickets, hire a private shuttle to drop off/pick up, or bring/rent bicycles.  You could walk but that's inadvisable as it's 5mi one-way from visitor center to trail head for Angels and 8.5mi one-way from  visitor center to trail head for Narrows (and you'd have to walk back from there).

If you do secure the $1 shuttle tickets, you just show up at the visitor center before your shuttle leaves.  Visitor center parking often fills at 9am or earlier.  There is pay parking in Springdale and you can walk into the park from there.  You still have to pay the park entrance fee or have the America the Beautiful annual pass.

You can drive your private vehicle to trails and lookouts in Kolob Canyon, off of I-15.  You can drive your private vehicle to trails and lookouts on Kolob Terrace and you can drive your private vehicle on UT9 up the switchbacks to the Zion-Mt Carmel tunnel and explore the east side of the park.  I suggest you look thru [Joe's Guide to Zion](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/) and other online resources for hike ideas.

There is BLM land east and west of the park if you want to disperse camp.  You can find suggestions online but a number of locations require high clearance.

"Aside from canyon overlook, I’m not aware of any other significant hikes just off of the drive through the park (route 9, which is different from the scenic drive). However, if the weather is good (no recent rain), you might consider driving to the east mesa trailhead, and walking to observation point. It’s not a short hike like canyon overlook (maybe 6 miles round trip if I recall correctly), but less strenuous since it’s essentially all flat. It’s totally worth it - it’s the most beautiful view in the park, and one of the best in the US.

To drive to the east mesa trailhead from Springdale, you take route 9 all the way through the park, and actually exit the park. So, you could always do canyon overlook on your way through, and/or pull off the road at various scenic lookouts on your way there. Also, if you do drive to the east mesa trailhead, know that part of the drive is on dirt roads. I would recommend 4x4 or AWD and clearance, although that’s certainly not a necessity if the ground is dry. I’d recommend doing some more research on your own.

"Sure thing. We rented the ebikes from Zion Cycles in Springdale. They provide a helmet and lock. One thing I didn't expect is how sore I would get from the bike. Not as in sore muscles, but just from sitting on the bike and hitting bumps etc.  If you bike a lot, you wont have to worry about that. I eventually figured out to slightly raise up when going over bumps. Biking Zion Canyon is by far the most amazing bike ride I've ever done.  [https://www.zioncycles.com/](https://www.zioncycles.com/)

We did not do the narrows hike, but we did the river hike up to the start of the narrows. There were a lot of people doing the narrows though. We just didn't have time for it with our limited schedule. We plan to go back for the narrows in the future. It looks amazing.

The reason I recommend private shuttles is because some hotels won't allow you to store your bike in your room so you'll have to arrange picking up the bike right when the bike store opens at 7:30. We did this and rode directly to Angels Landing, and it was already pretty crowded. If you want to beat the first shuttle of people to the cool hikes, it seems private shuttles are the best way.

"You can't wait.  They sell out in minutes, if not seconds.

Set up your recreation.gov account ahead of time.  Familiarize yourself with the site.  Log on and be ready to go before the time they're released.  Note that the time listed on the [NPS website](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/zion-canyon-shuttle-tickets.htm) is Mountain Time, so adjust to whatever time zone you're in.  Maybe even enlist some family/friends to also try.  Maybe try for a non-weekend day - not sure if there is less pressure on those tickets but makes logical sense that would be the case.

> May 1 - 15, 2021, advance tickets are released on April 16, at 9:00 a.m. MT

If you don't get these advance tickets, you can try for the ones released the day in advance at **5 pm MT**.  Note that cell coverage is spotty in Springdale and the entire Zion region and may not even exist at Zion Mt Ranch.  There are also the walk-up wait-in-line tickets between 2 and 4 pm - it is possible to do Angels Landing (takes 3 hrs or more), Emerald Pools (takes 2 to 3 hrs), or Riverside Walk down to start of Narrows (takes an hour or so) in late afternoon.  Just don't wait for the last bus to leave - it might be full.

Personally, I think bringing/renting [bicycles](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/m2fj3h/im_ready_for_you_zion/gqkmek0/) is the best way to see the main canyon.

To answer the question you posed to someone else, you won't get a ticket if you park farther back from the trail head at East Mesa.  You could seriously upset someone though if you're inconsiderate enough to block one of the private cabin accesses - so don't do that.  Definitely check with rangers or Zion Ponderosa about road conditions if you have a sedan - might be pretty rutted and can be impassable if recent rain.  I suppose you could park all the way back at Zion Ponderosa and avoid the dirt road but that would add a little less than 2 miles one-way walking to Stave Spring or 3 miles one-way to East Mesa

Edit:  There are small signs on the dirt roads directing you to the trail heads.  The ones to Stave Spring don't say Stave Spring - they say Cable Mountain.  I believe the ones to East Mesa say Observation Pt and not East Mesa but I've never really paid much attention since I enter via Stave Spring when I stay up that way.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1618501893.0,0,t1_gum7rgd,gum7rgd,False,MyDadIsTheMan,t3_mr2yqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNP/comments/mr2yqu/spending_6_nights_at_zion_mtn_ranch_in_may_any/,"Spending 6 nights at Zion Mtn Ranch in May, any recs for hiking that avoid shuttle system?

"[Joe's Guide](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/) is a pretty good online source for hikes.  Look at Kolob Canyons, Kolob Terrace, and east side for hikes that don't require shuttle tickets.  See if you can get a wilderness permit for Subway bottom up.

Since you're on the east side, think about driving up North Fork Rd to the dirt road trail heads at East Mesa and Stave Spring (check at Zion Ponderosa or with the rangers for road conditions).  From Stave Spring you can get to [Deertrap](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/deertrap-mountain-via-stave-spring-trailhead) and [Cable Mountain](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/cable-mountain-via-stave-spring-trailhead).  You can combine both Cable and Deertrap if you're ambitious.

"Sort of similar view. They're both in the same general area. 

Angels Landing will most likely be crowded but I was able to do it when the crowds weren't too bad by waiting for the crowds to die down a bit (it was around 2pm when I did the chains). I don't think it'll be that bad on the chains as long as you take your time. 

Kind of depends on the people on the trail though, some people are more considerate than others, while some will try to pass by you while you are going up or down. Generally one group will let the other pass before going up or down on a particular area. The more crowded it is probably the more likely you'll have people that are pushy and anxious to pass.

Observation Point has a slightly better view in my opinion. It'll definitely be less crowded due to the difficulty of getting there and since Weeping Rocks trail is closed that used to generate most of the traffic. 

You should be able to get a regular car through the dirt roads depending on last time it rained or amount of snow/mud on the ground.

"Go to the outfitters for gear for The Narrows. They will set you up with the appropriate footwear, water socks, waders. They're located right before the entrance to the park. You can book your gear reservation online and pick up the morning of.

For Angel's Landing I would recommend hiking boots (high or low top). You are going to want a shoe with very good traction on sandstone. Also, I wouldn't consider this trail to be very difficult for a regular hiker. The chain section is very different from any other trail I've done and will be a bit unnerving for anyone with a fear of heights. I wouldn't recommend this trail to put those fears to the test, particularly because it is an out and back and there can be points where you will need to wait for other groups going the opposite direction to get by you while exposed on the cliff. With all that said, if you aren't terribly afraid of heights, be careful, and take your time on the chains, this trail is incredible!

I would also recommend getting the earliest shuttle to both of these trails.

Trail runners - they have better grip than normal running shoes. My husband and daughter both wore to do Angels landing. Just be careful to not go when there is ice or you might need micro spikes. Rent the gear for the narrows - probably still pretty cold. They have waders so you can stay dry. The store is right outside the walk through entrance.  Make sure you get a shuttle ticket reservation if they are still doing that. A lot of people when I went last October couldn’t go anywhere because they didn’t know you needed the shuttle ticket and they sell out fast.

"Cedar City is not the best choice if you want to spend every day in the main scenic canyon.  But, that's ok, you don't have to spend every day in the main scenic canyon.

It's only 20 minutes from Cedar City to the Kolob Canyons area.  You can spend a day there if you plan on hiking - do the scenic drive and Timber Creek overlook, [Middle Fork of Taylor Creek](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/middle-fork-taylor-creek-trail--4) is a nice 5mi hike, [North Fork of Taylor](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/taylornorth.php) is another nice 5mi diversion off of the same trail head that you can explore if you have time after Middle Fork, you could try Kolob Arch via La Verkin Creek if you want a long hike.

Not sure how far up Kolob Terrace Rd you can go right now, but you could do Northgate Peaks and some of the [other short hikes along that road](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/terrace.php).  Could take you 90 minutes to get some spots there from Cedar Breaks.  You get the pleasure of a lot fewer people and not having fighting parking/shuttle logistics challenges.

[Snow Canyon state park](https://www.alltrails.com/parks/us/utah/snow-canyon-state-park) is another option that's about an hour away from Cedar City.  The road into [Cedar Breaks](https://www.nps.gov/cebr/index.htm) will still [be closed](https://www.nps.gov/cebr/planyourvisit/winter-access.htm) but you can drive up there and even walk some of the road into the park if you wish (will be cold at 10k ft).

For the days when you do drive the 60 to 80 minutes to Springdale, keep an eye on [ZionNPS twitter](https://twitter.com/ZionNPS?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) to see when visitor center parking fills (but plan on getting there before 9am regardless).  That way you don't need to pay for parking in Springdale (though you can still walk out of the park to catch the town shuttle to get a bite to eat).  Note that the $1 shuttle tickets are one-and-done so don't come back to Springdale for lunch and expect to get back on the canyon shuttle for the afternoon.  You can hike Watchman without need for a shuttle ticket and then also go on UT9 up the switchbacks thru the tunnel to the east side scenic drive and Canyon Overlook hike.

Just noticed when looking at ZionNPS twitter that Middle Fork of Taylor Creek had some damage due to rock fall.  Looks like it's partially open now.  Might be interesting to go up to the second cabin to see if you can see the damage and then backtrack to the first cabin and then do the North Fork trail.
