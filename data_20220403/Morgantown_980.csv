"If you want to try to keep him, Kris at the Clever Canine might be able to help with the aggression / excessive defensive behavior: https://theclevercanine.teachable.com/p/localdogtraining

We are dealing with similar issues with a dog we rescued from a pound, who was also tied outside previously. She would lunge and snap at anyone who came to the house, or any dogs she saw when out walking.

Kris came to our house for 2 individual lessons, and following her suggestions, we saw immediate improvement. 

It's been several months now, and our dog is able to control herself when people come to the house. We're taking group classes and her behavior around other dogs has greatly improved, and she's even made a couple of dog friends.

I won't say it was easy. It's taken a lot of work and patience, and we've still got a way to go to reach our goals, but she's worth it.

"3 dollars a paycheck forever to a city that does nothing that helps me with any of their money. That imposes shitty rules on what I can do with my own money?

I dont spend any money in morgantown city limits either, even convinced the 3 kids to go elsewhere for college instead of WVU, all over that 3 dollar fee. More folks should do likewise. Next time it will be a 10 dollar fee, 20 dollar ect.

"You need to visit the Monongalia County Assessor’s Office in the county courthouse if you haven’t yet so that you can pay taxes on your vehicle and dog if those apply to you. This is your Personal Property Tax. Once you are assessed, you can walk down the hall to the Sheriff’s Office to pay. In future years, you’ll get a ticket in the mail so you can pay that way or online. 

If you own a home, you’ll also be paying property taxes through the county but are probably already doing that through escrow.

"Avoid ""Sunnyside"" and the ""close to downtown"" section of South Park, as well as the closest we have to a ghetto which is near ""marjorie gardens"". Your best bet is probably to try to find a landlord willing to do a short-term rental - they often have students bail, but you *will* run into plenty who insist on a year lease. I'd actually suggest against Wiles Hill - it's the backside of the student-heavy area's hill - as well as most of Westover which looks quaint but is pretty run-down and poor. You want deep in Suncrest, mid-south park if you want to be downtown (further from downtown than Wilson but not past the top of the hill where Grand does a dog-leg), or even out towards Cheat Lake if you don't mind a little commute to live in the woods.

Pretty much all of the non-chain restaurants in town are bangin'. The rail trail is good hiking/biking, there are decent art events sometimes downtown (they're coming back now that people are accepting regular covid deaths as part of normalcy), and if you're lucky there may be a decent artist concept put on through WVU at the Creative Arts Center - plenty of other plays, concerts, etc there too!

If you want to get out into nature a bit more, there's Cooper's Rock ofc, but also the lesser known Virgin Hemlock Trail across the interstate from Cooper's. The Arboretum and Botanical Gardens are nice if you want to see varietal plants.

Def avoid downtown late nights, it's a barely-regulated shit show. Def check out 123 Pleasant Street when you get a chance, even if it's not your 'scene' it's a historic music landmark. You'd be surprised the bands that have played on that stage despite this being a small town!

"I was a student and lived in Morgantown for a while and currently live in Washington PA for about 2 years now.

My advice, just pick one. We live in a weird in between - 45 mins to morgantown, 45 mins to downtown pitt. I would much rather just have one or the other. 45 minutes is enough that you don't want to be out at late events or hanging with friends after work very long which can make it really hard to make friends and plans. There isn't a lot of events and activities in Washington. 

I know you might have limited job options but I would move to morgantown 100% rather than try to live in between. There are lots of government related jobs in fairmont and Clarksburg if you want to keep commuting options open try looking south instead.

"Having worked in northern Virginia for 15 years and lived just north of Charlottesville, it’s a hell of a lot better living in Morgantown. We have everything you need and if we don’t Pittsburgh is an hour away. I was commuting 2-3 hours (with traffic) to DC when I lived in VA. NOVA is a hell hole imo, I’m from West Virginia though so it felt right moving back. I’ve lived in Motown for 5 years now and went back to Charlottesville for a concert in February and nothing has changed there for the better. Also almost everything was closed which was a bummer. I’m going to see a concert in DC in may and I’ll be curious as to what has changed in nova and DC. 

I might add if you aren’t used to driving in the snow and ice it might be a learning curve, as well as how to drive like a drunk driver to avoid potholes in WV and PA.

"Yeah, I have. State law requires ""reasonable notice"", considered by precedent to be 24 hours but in effect means ""next day notice"". It is straight up *trespassing* for them to come onto the property without notice (like you can call the cops for real) UNLESS it's for an emergency. With notice it must still be for a business purpose. Good luck proving it though. They're almost certainly showing the place for future renters without notice - they have the right to show it, but they MUST give notice.

No Heat: This is illegal. Unfortunately your only real right is what's called 'constructive eviction'. Call WV legal aid for help with getting out (and getting your deposit back!) AND the Housing Inspector for Morgantown b/c that shit is NOT up to code and those people do NOT fuck around (they will give Kingdom all the hell you wish you could, seriously). Here's the fun part - for every month you've been without what's known nationally as the ""Implied Right of Habitability"" (you also have an implied right to quiet enjoyment), which includes things like heat electricity and more, you can get BACK RENT given to you. Again... you need a lawyer ideally, or some skills and a call to legal aid. In the end this is simple enough you could represent yourself but you need to know the laws a bit better than thinking this is remotely tolerable - it's definitely not legal.

Kingdom will try to fuck you, but you need a court judgement here. If they *then* try to keep the deposit, you'll get 3x back.

in my experience we was always dragged around for 4 to 5 months for apts and did little work each time and even made us go to Ortho for no reason. even said had cavities that needed fixed that wasn’t even a cavity. found out didn’t need Ortho or cavities fixed once switched to a different practice in town and they did exam and said no there is no cavities and your teeth don’t need Ortho services. parking is not ideal ethier after 11am it’s impossible to find a parking spot close to the building so if do go get early apt if even available. for my insurance they are considered out of network so once I found that out also stoped going to save money on my end. they won’t tell you they out of network they will just say yea we accept such coverage.

"Just want to say that this former agent's comments are legit af, Smith Rentals is THE WORST slum lord in town, even knocking McCoy 6 off that pedestal, and I'd like to add that while they're nice guys, Pearand Corp's apartments are all pretty run-down places that you'd expect a college sophomore to party in; check out Mark Rogers (M R Properties), he's fair priced and reasonably maintained though I don't think he has anything in South Park. Also Bill Bjorkman who has places in south park. A lot of the best finds are unfortunately also independent landlords, and those can be hit or miss though in general it's far more good on average than the big companies.

Whatever you do, read your lease beforehand, and know your rights. WV has some of the best renter laws in the country, but being a college town you need to walk the line perfectly to be able to exercise them. Notably: Landlords are required to give 'reasonable notice' before entering a leased apartment, typically said to be 24 hours but in practice is ""next day"", otherwise you have the right to refuse entry and it would be trespassing for them to enter. Security deposits have a 30 day return window, and you can ask for itemized receipt of damages (and context them with evidence, and be entitled to 3x the amount wrongfully seized if they try to withhold it). Also you're not responsible for anything over $25 in terms of light bulbs or batteries for smoke detectors (which IS on you), nor are you responsible for wear and tear repairs whatsoever.

Lots of landlords here put all sorts of shady shit in their lease that can't be enforced.

As a grad student, try and get a place that's further from town than Wilson Ave (runs by the front of the high school), you'll be away from any of the ""party"" types and still within a 2mi walk to campus or the Rail Trail. Down on Beechhurst it's a combo of student noise and traffic, sunnyside is party central. ""Southpark"" is east/southeast of downtown (high street) and gives you easy access to the rail trail by dropping to the left as you cross the Walnut St bridge (super steep hill with a switchback). I forget the name of the area but directly south (just past the graveyard on south high) is passable, not quite as close but there's ""park"" trails in White Park that are both ""smoother"" general walking/running trails and bike-ridden cross country, and it's not hard to hit the rail trail from that end of town either, you come down to the bridge crossing on south high and go left towards the river and before you hit the Blvd, on the left across from the sheetz will be a way down to the trail.

I'd definitely try and use google street view to get an idea of the hills in the area you're looking at.

"South Park may work for you. Plenty of apartments, and walking distance to the downtown campus and downtown Morgantown. A lot of apartments there may not include laundry, but there is a laundromat. 

Star City is close to the Rails to Trails and is closer to the Evansdale side of things - but the trail will take you downtown. It is a short drive to downtown. Parking and traffic are factors to consider.

I would not recommend Smith Rentals or Metro Properties. Smith Rentals doesn't maintain their properties well, and Metro charges a lot of fees, and will only allow students to rent at ""student properties.""

"Yes but no lol. So the history of the pepperoni roll is was a cheap food created by Italian immigrants that didn’t need to be refrigerated and was filling so Italian coal miners could bring them into the coal mines for lunch. That’s what makes them unique. You can buy a bag of 20 at the gas station and take them on a trip and not worry about them. No fridge needed. Just eat them at room temp

Or you could buy more fancy ones at a restaurant that come with dipping sauce and heated up. My fav pepperoni rolls are sold by the donut shop in buckhannon. They grind their pepperoni up so the melted mozz or pepper jack cheese gets mixed into it. Around Morgantown you’ll find the variety with sliced pepperoni and mozzarella at most places.

"That's amazing to know! Thank you.

Okay so more about the novel. It's an Urban Fantasy, set in current times. The Earth is a ""Prison World"" for the Fae realms. They sentence their wrong-doers here and strip them of their magic by way of magical wards placed and maintained all over the Earth. There's a strong Egyptian background to the first book's lore, and expands to include other lores, Mexico and central Americas for book 2, Norse and Dutch for 3, so on.

The MC is the daughter of two chimeras, one of which was sentenced to Earth for wrongdoing, and the other who was essentially a prison warden. She has no idea that she's actually a magical being, but discovers it along the way with guidance from another chimera.

She's going for a Bachelors in Journalism (already reached out the WVU to get a course list!) and likes investigating interesting stories and reporting on them. There's a mystery element to the book, the secondary character has come here from one of the fae realms looking for a wrongly sentenced exile who happens to be a doctor who was working on a cure for a disease that affects only the chimera fae (I've nicknamed it Fraebies for now... no idea what I'll actually call it haha).  
So, throughout the book she's helping this secondary character track down the missing exile (woo title of the book!) while also puzzling out this story of missing peoples that she'd been working on, and of course they intersect and are one in the same.

"It depends on where you live.  Our first 1.5 years here we lived in Hidden Point right near Exit 7 off I-68, working at the WVU downtown campus, and there was almost no issue with getting to/from work or around town in front wheel drive vehicles (Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra).  There was maybe one day when I could not get out of the steep entrance to the community up to Pierpont Rd.

However, after we moved to South Park (pretty far up Grand), we had to purchase an AWD vehicle just because of the various hills leading up to where we live.

"* With the road conditions, potholes, and general steepness I'd say clearance and wheel diameter is possibly more important that AWD/4wd.   The Fit, as cool as it is, is deficient in both categories.  4-6"" deep potholes are typical this time of year.  Dodge as many as possible, but there are some that not always avoidable. Bigger wheels handle them better.  Parking lot/driveway entrance can be high angle and/or rough, both making it hard on low clearance vehicles.  If you want 365 days a year mobility AWD/4wd will be needed.   
* It's steep, you saw that.  If you buy/rent a place that requires a daily grind up a real steep pitch think about vehicles with robust transmissions (tow vehicles).

"Well...

Ok, we have had several mild winters the past decade. In fact, there were only two years where having a front-wheel-drive sedan (i.e. Lancer, Civic, Corolla) was a hinderance and that was Snowmageddon (2010?) and I want to say 2013 or 14 where we had a bad run of storms. This winter we had a couple decent snows and one that was probably best for a 4WD, so take that information how you wish.

I *do* recommend you get something above a sedan (front-wheel-drive crossover or SUV) for the simple reason that our (state) roads are bumpy and full of holes thanks to poor maintenance and heavy truck usage in town (you will know the routes I'm referring to when you see them). You will damage your undercarriage hitting some of those in a sedan. Otherwise, 4WD is a luxury, not a necessity, but be aware we are due a solid snowstorm every few years.

"At Berkeley Medical Center, in Martinsburg Wv the OPT ER staff received letters stating two 12 hour shifts per month are now mandatory. One of which must be over a weekend. My other half has been an RN BSN for several years, having witnessed the steady decline in working conditions and effective management devolving in a small herd of petulant snot monsters, she went to other healthcare organizations for primary income and staying with Berkeley as occasional part time. She got the letter last week, demanding OPT nurses pick up shifts or else....
I hear a dismissive giggle as the letter is sent to the recycling bin.
The moral of the story? The beatings will continue until morale improves.

Also, an absolute treasure of a view is just a mile or so away from downtown at Dorsey's Knob. All the way at the top of the rock, you can see out across a pretty incredible view (for the area, anyway) of the surrounding mountain range. Morgantown is sort of in a bowl in the middle of a plateau of mountaintops (""rolling hils""), with this being the highest peak in the area - which is also to say that weather here can be unpredictable at times.

I second all the bars listed, specifically 123 Pleasant Street (which may have a show of wildly different alternative music types) and The Apothecary (some of the best beer selection in town). Brew Co and Yama are some of my favorites in town, but honestly almost all of the non-chain restaurants around here are great, such as Burgers and Bites downtown, or Scorer's Bar in Westover (oddly great kitchen for a bar).

The PRT itself is neat (it was the prototype model for systems such as San Francisco's BART), though I don't think you really need to go ""end to end"" it's fun enough if you have nothing else to do, just remember to get off at the ""end of the line"" at Medical or Downtown. ;)

Riverfront park is a decent enough place to take a stroll while you're downtown, maybe eat your food there if it's a decent day. The Rail Trail is great for a hike, as well, in any direction really.

I just need a local agent who is familiar with the process, and has these contacts, so I can refer the client. If I were licensed in VW I would handle it on my own.

"I mean Rent to Own is just a different version of a financial agreement in a purchase. That's going back to the legal team and bank. Having a realtor experienced in it only helps if they're sitting on properties where that's what the owners are interested in. Your issue is finding a seller who would be interested in that on the market. More often this is an agreement that comes together when the buyer and seller know each other or have a history of renting from each other.

It's weird to think these communities had so many shared experiences at these stores and now they're all but forgotten except for some ruined empty buildings and I'm not even 40. 

While I don't remember thrift drug there next to Hills, I do remember there being a pizza parlor down there that I think my dad dragged us to once or twice... would have been a few stores down, but I can't remember if I'm confusing different memories. It wasn't a place we frequented (grew up in Fairmont), but I don't think it was a chain.

"Id recommend looking up some maps, it’s a bit hard to explain the layout. It’s all in Morgantown, it’s just that health sciences is like a few buildings next to the hospital (it’s more concentrated and there’s wayyyy less undergrads and better housing options close by!). When you go downtown, it’s like a mix of campus buildings and like shops and bars and just like an army of undergrads. 
If you want to be able to walk to work, Georgetown, chateau, chestnut hill, copper field court, and any of the complexes in that area by the football stadium are generally graduate student focused and affordable. 
The majority of the living complexes on West Run are undergrad focused, but you can get one bedrooms there (or rent a 2 bedroom for yourself) that I’ve heard not terrible things about. The villages are more professional student focused.
If you’re looking at Zillow, just keep watching. You’d think that you’d want to look early, but it’s really a matter of like catching it when it’s posted. Id avoid sunny side (neighborhood) because it’s full of undergrads. If you’re looking to rent a house just like… be careful because most of the people renting them out assume they’re going to be destroyed by undergrads so they suck. 
Most of the apartment complexes here are owned by metro who aren’t ~terrible~ if you just like accept the fact that your security deposit is gone forever. 
Id recommend figuring out what campus you’re on because if you’re on health sciences try not to live downtown! It’s just more expensive and loud, and if you ever want to go you can drive or take public transport",t2_38dr1y84,OrangeMrSquid,0,1643511454.0,0,t1_husxsq7,husxsq7,False,Pure_Nourishment,t3_sfxmy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorgantownWV/comments/sfxmy8/grad_student_housing_tips/,Grad Student Housing Tips?,/r/MorgantownWV/comments/sfxmy8/grad_student_housing_tips/husxsq7/,4,r/MorgantownWV,0,4

"If you’re working as a GA/TA you’ll probably be able to buy a parking permit, which may or may not be for a parking lot that is more convenient than the Coliseum.

I’d suggest connecting with a realtor. Many of them work with multiple property managers and be able to help you find something that’ll suit your budget and lifestyle. Usually they’ll do this at no charge to you.

I had a friend who lived at Colonial Park on University Ave during grad and it was the quietest apartment complex I’ve ever visited. I lived at Timberline on Collins Ferry and the apartments were pretty nice and allowed pets, but the maintenance people were a bit inconsistent. Woodburn, Suncrest, Cheat Lake, and Brookhaven are all pretty nice, low key places to live. If you want a house, you could probably rent something affordable in Westover.

"It’s hard to say what location because it depends what campus you’ll be on but I do wanna say that the Morgantown renting market is very very tight. A lot of people probably already have leases for next fall. 

For $800, you’ll be able to get a nice place. I pay about that for a 1 bedroom apt in a house in the Woodburn neighborhood and I love it. Quiet neighborhood & close to campus.

The best tip I can give is to avoid: Smith rentals, housing directly behind the MountainLair (frat row), and Beverley Ave (party street). Also look really really close at the topography on Google maps if you plan to walk, the hills are steeper than they look.

Also a note: if you’re planning to drive to class, the only free parking is at the coliseum.

"Pre-pandemic, the Morgantown library had only recently started a kids D&D night that got my daughter really into it and I know they were going to start an adult group as well (I was even considering trying that). They also had a board game night and other similar fun stuff. As someone who grew up in WV as a AD&D-playing 80s kid, I'm still both amused and impressed by how it's gotten so mainstream. When I was a kid, people accused me of devil worshipping and (I wish this was a joke) in Jr High we lost our party's magic user because his parents made him quit and burn all his books at their church book burning. So, yea, things have improved. Sadly, I still haven't played in decades, but I keep up and as others said, there's places to find people and connect. I live a bit outside Morgantown as I like more trees than people, but if you're a person who enjoys rational thought and not-horrible morals and ethics, Morgantown is absolutely the spot in this state. That said, depending on where you end up for a job and childcare, etc., you can feel incredibly isolated by all the right-wing garbage in the state as a whole. I'm told people with normal, non-spectrum-ish social skills find like-minded people of whatever type fairly well though!",t2_4i0la4q5,jdaprile73,0,1643304344.0,0,t1_hugp5th,hugp5th,True,CaptPanDaddy,t3_sdpctx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorgantownWV/comments/sdpctx/moving_to_the_morgantown_area_and_wondering_if_i/,Moving to the Morgantown area and wondering if I could ask a couple of questions?,/r/MorgantownWV/comments/sdpctx/moving_to_the_morgantown_area_and_wondering_if_i/hugp5th/,2,r/MorgantownWV,0,2
"Welcome to WV!

There is a great (in my biased opinion) board game community here (Monongalia, Marion, and Harrison counties). We are LGBTQ+ friendly. We haven't had much in the way of in-person gatherings since the pandemic started, but that should change as conditions improve:

[WV Nerd Herd FB Page](https://www.facebook.com/wvnerdherd)

[Private FB Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wvnerdherd)

[Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/xautdYpC)

The Marion County Public Library (15 miles south of Morgantown) has resumed having our weekly board game night on Wednesday nights at 5pm. It officially goes until 9pm, but the guy who runs the program usually lets us stay until at least 10pm. It is loosely affiliated with the above community.

[MCPL Game Nights FB page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/722665634523263)

As for game stores, as /u/s_bright mentioned Four Horsemen is a great store. The owner and his family are very friendly and give back a lot to the gaming community. They have accumulated a ton of good will, so I think you would be hard-pressed to compete with them. Five-ish years ago there was an explosion of new game stores in the area, and 3/4 of them didn't survive.

There are plenty of people around that roleplay, but as I'm sure you're aware, it is often hard to find a group that matches one's own play style and isn't already full. If you're looking for a public D&D game, that's easy enough to find, but finding a private group can take some doing.",t2_2y7rl,jeff0,0,1643300784.0,0,t1_hugf7wy,hugf7wy,True,CaptPanDaddy,t3_sdpctx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorgantownWV/comments/sdpctx/moving_to_the_morgantown_area_and_wondering_if_i/,Moving to the Morgantown area and wondering if I could ask a couple of questions?,/r/MorgantownWV/comments/sdpctx/moving_to_the_morgantown_area_and_wondering_if_i/hugf7wy/,5,r/MorgantownWV,0,5

I honestly only see problems here from the elderly men and only when you ""throw it in there face"" so to speak. they will tell you what they think. but keep it to yourself and they are just fine.

"  My recommendations would be:

 Don't waive inspection, but do use an escalation clause.  

All foundations are suspect until proven otherwise.   Bad soils, unstable slopes, and abandoned underground mines are to be expected.  Monongahela roughly translates as ""falling banks"".  

We have 13 superfund sites and  other sites being evaluated.  Check the EPA site if you would be concerned about buying next to or on one. 

The City/County line is weird and convoluted.  In the county privately owned developed built roads are not uncommon. These roads may have not effective maintenance program.  

Zoning is a new thing and not really in play in the county.  

Renting is expensive, but consider renting for a year while you search.  60-90 days to find and get an offer accepted. Then 45-60 days to close.  There are typically more listings in the Spring.  

Be ready to jump on an offer.  Good options in the sub $300k range generally have offers within a couple hours of listing.

For a realtor, I would recommend [Brett Matak] (https://www.brettmatak.com/).  She was very patient and knowledgeable, all around the best realtor I've ever worked with.

Very generous tournaments, and he just put in some semi-private rooms for tabletop gaming in the new store.  I'd love to play some live D&D myself there again soon.

"[This is the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MorgantownWV/comments/scm0k9/interviewing_at_wvu/) the other poster was talking about, a lot of your questions are answered here. Here’s what I can add to what’s already been said (Vice, Four Horseman, 123s, Cooper’s Rock).

South Park is arguably the most liberal neighborhood in the state. Pride flags everywhere, I know at least two MtFs who live here. The farther you are from the creek the nicer the homes are. The yearly community yard sale is *the. shit.* You’ll see signs.

The Best Food/Drink: Table 9, Yama, Iron Horse, Ogawa, Dirty Bird, Mountaineer Roasting Co, Blue Moose, Quantum Bean, Zeke’s and Von Blaze. If you’re a gay tabletop kinda person, Apothecary is about to be your favorite bar. Tin 202 is lovely if you’ve got the income for it.

I’m a bit of a hermit so I’m not the best to ask, but if you’re looking to keep tabs on underground culture here, check out the posters at Zeke’s, 123s, and the Art Bar.

There was an attempt to [kickstart some down payment money](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tabletop-parlor/tabletop-parlor-morgantowns-board-game-cafe) for a tabletop focused coffee shop downtown a couple years back, but COVID and a lack of advertising kicked that plan in the teeth.

"I live here and have for a long time. I’m a native WVian and have lived a few other places and traveled a fair bit. 

Hard truth:  Morgantown has basically zero “big city” stuff (for lack of a better word) and a lot of our best assets are “outdoorsy,” so… don’t get too excited, I guess. 

But if you want to check shit out…. In addition to the already mentioned Vice, 123 pleasant street is the primary music venue (and has a vibrant, multi-faceted scene, Covid aside), Gene’s and Mario’s Fishbowl are my favorite locals-mostly-but-not-in-a-mean-way watering holes. Art scene is decent, but kind of scattered and inconsistent. There is a place called the “art bar” on high street, WVU’s museum is nice, not sure what else in the art category off the top of my head… food scene is good, but again, probably not big-city caliber (though I would Yama up against basically any restaurant in America). Coopers Rock is the most oft cited outdoor asset in the area and if the drive to the overlook is open it’s a gorgeous site. 

I can’t speak to queer community, especially now. I’m a straight white dude so it’s easy to blend in but I guess sometimes I don’t and when that happens, it is always, ALWAYS, 20-something dudes (almost certainly wvu students) who are the problem. I imagine you are well-versed with that phenomena. 

Anyway, it seems like WVU faculty jobs are often used as stepping stones anyway and I think Morgantown is probably a pretty good place for that sort of thing - it’s close to the action without being right in it so cost of living is pretty good. Good luck in your interview.",t2_eqbz1,erghjunk,0,1643144406.0,0,t1_hu7ccxh,hu7ccxh,True,Spooky_Dyke,t3_scm0k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorgantownWV/comments/scm0k9/interviewing_at_wvu/,Interviewing at WVU,/r/MorgantownWV/comments/scm0k9/interviewing_at_wvu/hu7ccxh/,5,r/MorgantownWV,0,5
"I also think it’s important to know. You don’t want to move to somewhere discriminatory & I think the person above’s comment was out of line. The comment actually embarrassed me, as I’ve lived in Morgantown for about 6 years. I’ll be moving soon and when I do, I’m also gonna want to know if my new city will discriminate against me.

Anyway, Morgantown is a small city, with a decent sized queer population. You’ll probably connect with other faculty or people related to university the most. It’s a pretty young town, and sometimes I do find myself annoyed with the amount of 18 year olds there are hahah. 

There are a lot of opportunities for art, craft beer, and “shop small” type activities. It’s honestly pretty cute. Lots of nice cafes and food to try. The size of the city is both big enough that you can blend in or small enough for you to be a regular. It’s the best of both worlds. For me, i feel a little limited sometimes, but there is honestly always something new to do here if you know where to look

However, You might be more interested in commuting from Pittsburgh though. Not that I would recommend it, but I know faculty that do it everyday and they seem content.

"We have a queer community, but it certainly isn't as vibrant as a lot of other cities. 

Vice is the only gay bar in town, but it generally has a good reputation so if that is your chic then by all means. 

The stereotypes about West Virginians being backwards and unaccepting of outsiders is both true and untrue. In Morgantown, you don't really find that mentality. And for those who do have that mentality, they wear their opinions on their sleeve. Just pick your battles and move on (especially with the picketers outside the Mountainlair who sometimes protest whatever abortion/2nd amendment/anti-socialist thing they are yelling about).

Morgantown is definitely not a terrible place to live, but (as with any new place) the culture might take a little getting used to.

And if you are really wanting that city feel or that more supportive queer community (we do have some University affiliated groups, but nothing large scale), Pittsburgh is only an hour and fifteen minutes by car.

As for neighborhoods, South Park is fantastic during the day, terrible at night. Downtown is loud on Fridays/Saturdays.

"Call A Plus Automotive ServicesLLC  at 681 285 4905 they cover multiple counties the best garage rates and fees by 50% and the reason they started there buisness was because they got tired of seeing every garage in morgantown and the surrounding g areas rip people off the average garage fee is 90 to as much as 175 dollars per hour and what they don't tell you is they charge per man hour and you would think that's one man per hour doing the work but it's not it's double even someti.es triple there posted garage fees and A Plus Automotive ServicesLLC  did research and sent people in various types and backgrounds to every shop in morgantown including dealerships and found that every single dealership and shop in morgantown Fairmont and some in PA charged for work not performed they all charged a markup price for parts and they took advantage of the person according to what they thought the person knew and didn't know so A Plus Automotive  ServicesLLC  there honest they don't charge markup on parts they do 24/7 roadside assistance they will come to your house or wherever your vehicle is and do the repair on the spot if they have to and they offer free towing for certain situations as long as they do the repairs they charge half the going garage rates so you save 50% automatically compared to any garage repair shop or towing buisness thst you can find and they have no problem getting any part you need they truly help families in need with flexible payment options and they offer more incentives for first responders,military,teachers,students,seniors,and all mothers of the world a true blessing and there ultimate goal is to make garages become fair and honest again or take all there buisness and put them out of buisness and they also donate cars that people donate to them to needy families so if you have a car to donate they will match the donation by paying out of pocket for the vehicles needed repairs and donate it to a family in need and they have and Co ti ue to change lives for the better and you could only wish or prey for more companies like A Plus Automotive ServicesLLC I've witnessed everything I've just stated and the owner lives a moderate life doesn't ask for much,couldn't be more fair a he's one of the if not the smartest person I've ever met and has bo problem showing you everything every step of the way a truly amazing man he doesn't advertise due to the fact that he likes to ha dle everything himself so he knows for a 100 % fact that every custo.er gets treated with the same courtesy and respect and truly goes above and beyond his goal is to open shops near every repair shop around and make them all good honest hardworking g shops again and when I asked him why he does it when he could be Making 3 times what he is not just by charging what everyone else does and he says every custo er I've served from day one no matter where I am or what I'm doing there isn't one who hasnt stopped to thank me or offer help wich I never ask of them I simply tell them to pay it forward to the next person. You see in need and for the families he's donated cars too he said when they didn't have a way around and things were harder I seen some of the same kids miserable depressed looks on there face because other kids had nice cars to get around in and ever child always remembers him even when the parents don't notice me the kid in the back seat does and the smiles I see on there face are priceless to my soul I had to fight tears as I noticed this happen right before my eyes and I've been going to him ever since you absolutely will not find a more honest pure kind hearted well mannered soul on this planet he truly would rather make less or take a loss than to hurt a family by taking money from them and he ended thst with this,what people don't thank about or don't care about is when these places rip families off like that there is a trickle down affect on everything thst happens after and I had a puzzled look and he said when you take from a family or rip a family off especially as bad as all these garages do your taking from the children and if your a parent you will understand because there isn't anything a parent won't do for there child and when there hit financially like these garages do to everyone there taking something and most commonly more than just one thing from that child that he or she wanted and bor.ally would have gotten regardless of there age a mother never stops being a mother until the day she's layer to rest and a real father never stops until he's layer to rest so the cycle of cheating people just has to stop and if garages practiced there buisness the way I do I thank they will fi d thst they make just as much because although they will make less per vehicle they work on the gain it right back in the number of customers they service because they make it affordable for everyone it's a win win all the way around and in everyone's best Interest but getting them to do the right thing to prove it there to greety to do it or there to hung up on things they don't even need and there wants outweigh there morals.like I said early on in this comment a very smart man I've never met someone quite like him ever 681 285 4905 change is a phone call away and he's knowledgeable in how to pursue these places for fraudulent scheming people out of money",t2_igvly95k,DeepestMind,0,1641894480.0,0,t1_hs6sure,hs6sure,True,krenster,t3_s0odwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorgantownWV/comments/s0odwo/auto_repair_warning_shorty_anderson/,Auto repair warning: Shorty Anderson,/r/MorgantownWV/comments/s0odwo/auto_repair_warning_shorty_anderson/hs6sure/,-1,r/MorgantownWV,0,-1

"I had a car in rough shape. I'm talking a complete rust bucket. But I didn't have many options at the time or knowledge of the condition of my car. I took it there because it refused to start. After a few days they said it was the fuel pump and replaced it. Around $500.

Car worked well for awhile then when it got cold it stopped wanting to start again. Had it towed to them about 3 different times and each time they put heet in it and let it sit.

After the 4th or so trip they say they cannot find out the issue and to take it to MARS. I took it to another shop (not open anymore. Shady owner) and they found the fuel line was completely broken and since the age of my car they would have to fabricate a new one. On top of that the old wires connecting to the new fuel pump were heat wrapped and coming loose. I do not blame Shortys for the shotty wiring... it was the previous owners own handy work. 

My problem was the couldn't identify a busted fuel line or loose wires before charging me $500 for a fuel pump after 4 trips to their shop.

I went back and got refunded for the labor costs and was told by them that they should have never worked on my car or accepted it. So if it was in such bad shape why charge me $500 for a fuel pump? Just tell me to scrap it.

"I've had a different experience with them, they tend to be very communicative and have always treated me fairly, despite my lack of knowledge.

I will say I've never actually been serviced by them -- I brought in my car for a windshield repair, a transmission repair, and a tire repair. At least a few years ago, they usually have a 2-3 week wait before they could get started. They always gave me a timeframe and a quick referall. As I've needed things done more quickly, I've gone with who they recommended me with -- and every time, I got excellent service for about half of what I was expecting to pay.

I've always felt they went above when it came to communicating and treating me fairly & with respect.

That being said, my feedback is based on my interactions 2-3 years ago, and I never ultimately used them to get my vehicle repaired (they were honest with their lengthy timelines). I also never dealt with them over the phone -- in person, they always made time to talk things over in the office and help me out.

I will say that based on word of mouth (how I was recommended) is they do good work at a fair price, and will treat you with honesty and get you to a shop that is better suited to your needs (such as a faster turnaround or more specialized service). But they are always backed up, delays aren't unheard of, and you typically wouldn't use them for any time-sensitive work.

I'm sorry you had a bad experience. Hopefully, the new garage is communicating better and you'll not have to drive 12 hours to get into a crazy argument.

It's still nice to do in the winter as the scenery is still beautiful and the crowds are much smaller than peak summer traffic.  Bonus, Blackwater Falls is an area with dense Rhodedendrum forest, so the scenery is still very green even in January. [https://wvstateparks.com/park/blackwater-falls-state-park/](https://wvstateparks.com/park/blackwater-falls-state-park/) 

NOTE: there are a good number of stairs to walk down and back up to see Blackwater Falls ""up close"", (hence why the ice, blizzard, and rain are important to avoid).  Also, some people just don't like / can't do a ton of stairs.

Afterwards, checking out the cafes and restaurants in Thomas & Davis before or afterwards for a bit is nice.

========

*Laurel Caverns*

Another ""outdoor"" activity that doesn't care what the weather is outside: going in a cave. The most ""local"" ""developed"" cave I usually recommend is Laurel Caverns in Pennsylvania: [https://laurelcaverns.com/](https://laurelcaverns.com/) 

Note: this is a cave. There is lots of walking on uneven, sloped surfaces no matter how ""improved"" it is.  If you want a cave with great lighting and smooth paths... the nearest one is Luray Caverns in Virginia... which is well outside of your 2hr driving requirement.  (Although, Luray is fantastic... but I digress).

=============

*Western Maryland Scenic Railroad*

""Low energy / low walking"" alternative outdoor activity in Cumberland, Maryland: the Western Maryland Scenic Railway has a few Winter trains they run.  More schedule details here: [https://wmsr.com/train-schedule/](https://wmsr.com/train-schedule/)

It is a short train run up a steep grade from Cumberland to Frostburg in Maryland.  Haven't been on this in a few years, but I remember the train stopping in Frostburg for a while and there is a bit of time to walk around before the train turns around.

"It could be a few different things! For one, if you are a student at WVU, there may be an online forum they provide for students in need of rooms or roommates. Of course, there is a potential downside to this in that, if you are looking for someone outside of the typical college demographic, you're unlikely to find it in their database.

If you are not a student, you likely wouldn't have access to any sort of database that WVU may be using (although it doesn't hurt to ask!). What you can do, however, is take it upon yourself to go onto campus, find a few bulletin boards, and advertise a room for rent with basic info and contact information. Again, this generally limits you to college-aged individuals, but you COULD advertise to target professors or graduate students specifically if you wanted (alternatively, you can recruit a student to post your advertisement for you- they'll know the campus better anyway).

Lastly, if you do call the college, ask them where locals look for rooms or roommates. In all likelihood, they would probably say that students use some combination of the resources I've listed in my two posts, but they may have some other thing specific to the region (e.g. in one town where I lived, you mainly had to go onto the town's website and look at the classified ads to find rooms for rent).",t2_gka1rqv,Pure_Nourishment,0,1640571971.0,0,t1_hq3jve0,hq3jve0,False,quinn_reid_,t3_rp2xrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorgantownWV/comments/rp2xrm/housing_situation/,Housing Situation,/r/MorgantownWV/comments/rp2xrm/housing_situation/hq3jve0/,1,r/MorgantownWV,0,1

I pay my rent on time, they're good about calling ahead and responsive when there's an issue.

"If this is the guy I'm thinking of (I remember his name being Scott) I rented a place from him with some friends on Quadrilla Street back in 2008. A month after we moved in there was a heavy rain and the entire place flooded. We had to move all of our shit out, and find places to stay for two months while he renovated the place and ran dehumidifiers. The mother fucker had the nerve to ask us for a rent check afterwards, for a fucking empty apt that he was renovating!!!! We flat out told him that we were not paying rent for any of the months we weren't there, plus an extra for the inconveniences, and if he had a problem with that we would sue. Also, we didn't get our deposit back at the end of the rental. That's not surprising here in Morgantown though as I've only had one deposit returned out of the 5 places that I've rented.

"If they haven't given you notice (""next day"" presuming to be approx 24 hours but really they mean before 5pm) then you have the legal right to refuse entry, and it's trespassing if they don't. Literally call the police, they'll need proof of notice to enter.

As for the guy without the mask, again, REFUSE ENTRY. He's putting you at risk, and has no right to do so. Offer to allow them to comp your rent for the time you have to exit the apartment, INCLUDING your payout from your job. Most importantly, file a Cease and Desist against them for trespassing during hours you've made plain that you are working and the apartment is unavailable to show.

Last, but not least, find another apartment, and file for ""constructive eviction"", in that they have refused to respect your legal rights as a tenant you have the right to determine the lease is void (with a court hearing) because of that, and move elsewhere.

Seriously, the dude without a mask... refuse entry. 

>  a smug piece of shit who reveled in reminding me over and over that this is not my property, and that I have no right to tell him to wear a mask when he enters my home.

Remind him that since you signed a lease agreement, it is, in fact, your property during that time - that's what a lease is. They can't just walk in any time they want, and you can refuse ANYONE entry if they make you feel unsafe. Not wearing a mask is a clear threat to your well-being.

Understand that in the end, however, your sole recourse is going to be to move because they violated the terms of the lease... but, seriously, fucking refuse entry and call the police, then your lawyer.",t2_h1afn5q2,Smooth-Dig2250,0,1640295127.0,0,t1_hpqc5ad,hpqc5ad,True,abominablemoth,t3_rn53gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorgantownWV/comments/rn53gk/landlord_warning_scott_batt/,Landlord Warning: Scott Batt,/r/MorgantownWV/comments/rn53gk/landlord_warning_scott_batt/hpqc5ad/,16,r/MorgantownWV,0,16

"MOUNTAIN PEOPLE'S CO-OP CLOSING DOWN


12-14-2021
Address to Mountain People’s Co-op members and customers


Given the financial difficulties of the co-op, the Board of Directors and the staff had estimated that the store could remain open through December, 2021, and still meet payroll. With the most recent sales information, we see that we must alter this plan. It has been decided by the board that the business will close its doors on Friday, December 24, 2021 at 4 pm. At that time, the staff will be laid off and the board will work to determine next steps.

With this revised plan, the last opportunity to place a special order will be by Wednesday, December 15, 2021, no later than 10 am. All special orders must be with a prepaid deposit, which will be refunded only if the item does not arrive.

There has been talk of donations, which is touching. Please understand, though, that donations or fundraisers cannot revive this business. Some members of the local community express interest in beginning anew with some other vision. If you favor such a possibility, energy and ideas would be needed then.

People have been asking about Venerable Bean Bakery. VB is a separate entity which has operated on the premises of MPC for many years. The owner of VB intends for his business to continue at some new location in town. You can learn more about this wonderful and unique business and how you can support it at thevenerablebean@gmail.com.

Thank you all for your support over the years, and for the appreciation and understanding that so many have expressed recently, as we give Mountain People’s Co-op the most honorable ending we can manage.

"I lived at Terrace for 3 years. Management will not help you at all and they do not care about their tenants. I moved into a 1 bedroom there and the upstairs neighbors were a constant issue to the surrounding tenants. Constant domestic disputes, yelling and screaming. It was so loud that it seemed like they were in my apartment screaming. They constantly smoked weed and cigs in their apartment and it would come thru my air conditioning unit. They had children as young as 4 yrs old run around and throw trash everywhere. I recorded at least a months worth of audio and emailed and talked to the main office multiple times about addressing the situation or to allow me to move apartments and they refused to do anything.

They were aware of the issue and multiple complaints of other tenants too. It was so bad you could hear them in their own office. I never understood why nothing was done but they just seem to care about the money. Those tenants still live there afaik since I've moved away.

I also lived in a 2 bedroom apartment there and had to pull teeth for them to fix the carpet before move in. It was heavily buckled, stained and a hazard.

Aside from that, the allocated water bill can get pricey and the property is generally dirty and the bottom rows of apartments have flooding in their parking spots and storage rooms.

The previous leasing manager at Terrace was a god send but she retired and imo they didnt treat her well. Her new replacement is generally unhelpful.
