"It’s not that they see you as old or disabled, it’s that businesses around here generally just LOVE to take as much money as they can because 1) there’s not too many options. And 2) most of the people running these companies are friends or at least know the guys running the other companies. 

It’s very similar to landscaping businesses around here. You have a few major businesses that all know each other and charge out the ass, a couple of smaller businesses that still know the guys that ran the large businesses, and then small businesses that consist of guys that have previously worked for the large businesses and know that they can still get your money while charging you a *little* less.

When folks make concentrates from hemp they’re also typically decarbing and concentrating the THC which typically brings it above the .3 limit for final concentration in the finished product. If it is legal to possess hemp and concentrated oils under federal law its silly and limiting access to the raw ingredient which is at least 40x cheaper and affordable for everyone. The 0.3% is an arbitrary number folks can manipulate by throwing extra leaves and stems in the bag. The ratios are what’s most important since thc and cbd fight over the same receptor sites in your body. It’s literally impossible to get high from it.

"FYI everyone, it is against the law in the state of Virginia to possess hemp plants, viable hemp seed, hemp microgreens, hemp leaves, or hemp flowers, unless you are a licensed industrial hemp grower, dealer, or processor or an agent of one of these registrants for the purpose of growing, dealing or processing. Most people probably don't care, but just be informed. Some parts of the plant are legal to possess however, mostly the nonactive parts, as well as hemp derived extracts (ie CBD).

"I would recommend cross-posting this request (if you haven't already) to the r/virginiatech and seeing if there are any students who would be willing to help (im assuming Radford U also has a sub, so maybe there too).

EATS is a natural foods store but does have a small dedicated homebrewing section. They have good prices on some things like dry yeast, air locks, bungs, etc. but are more expensive on others. They do sell some base grains and crystal/roasted malts but they don't have a grain mill so you'll have to mill your own. 

&#x200B;

Southern Hills is the closest ""true"" homebrewing store to Blacksburg. They have just about everything you need and the owner is awesome. Also, last time I talked to them they were making periodic delivery trips to the Vintage Cellar (craft beer/wine store next to Kroger on S. Main) on Saturdays. So if EATS doesn't have what you need and you can give Southern Hills a little lead time, you can get what you need here in town.

">To say ""vote with your dollar"" is inherently an elitist logic which translates to ""the more money you have the more your vote and voice counts"".

Not when the action of ""voting"" is _not_ spending money at an establishment. 

As I said though, I recognize the entitlement inherent in the ability to choose to shop and work elsewhere. Fortunately due to the economy of the NRV, this is less of a burden than say in Covington VA. 

>Those of us who don't have a lot of money are working to utilize what little power we do have and using it to advance the issue, that's hardly privileged, unless you are comparing us and our political rights to another corner of the world where even petitioning might get you punished by the state. 

I think you entirely misunderstood my previous comment. 

You can use your limited resources to your advantage. Be extra selective about where to spend your money. Don't like what target does with the profits you help them earn by spending money at Target? Don't shop at Target. 

I don't agree with hobby lobby and the garbage political stunts they pull. From women's health to funding terrorists through ""artifacts"" they are a scummy company. So what can I do? I can tell others, and I can opt out of shopping there. 

That's both voting with my wallet, and getting on my soapbox. 

>We are asking for a small amount of effort and solidarity from the community to make the workplace and the corporation more accountable on behalf of LGBTQ coworkers.


The problem is, how do you make them accountable? How do you get their attention? Affect their bottom line. Petitions don't do this. Petitions are good at trying to raise awareness (soap boxing) but that only goes so far when you consider the sociology at play. 

>The petition isn't the only means to do this, but one aspect we are using to build pressure on corporate executives. 

What makes you think said executive will feel pressured from this or another petition? 

Obama wasn't particularly pressured to legalize weed just because 100k people clicked a button on a website. 

I don't think you shouldn't collect signatures, I just don't think they will be effective in advancing your goal and the current petition as worded could even leave you open to political pot shots because you want to force target to change it's speech.

"There are a couple of things to think about. Usually there are one to two ""large"" snowstorms each winter that bring 5-8"". Other than those two there maybe a few other times where there will be a couple of inches. In the instances where it snows a lot the roads in town and highway might be covered the day of and most of the following day but after that will be pretty clean. So it kind of depends on where you'll live, if you're within the town limits and you either live in a neighborhood that is on top of getting plows through or the town does it then you probably wouldn't really need them. If you live outside the town limits where no town plows go you could have snowy roads for close to a week, which is how long the snow tends to hang around when the big ones do roll in.",t2_hpmu7,runforreal,0,1492232402.0,0,t1_dgab7rc,dgab7rc,True,Darth_Ravenous,t3_65hdvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksburg/comments/65hdvp/are_snow_tires_needed_or_useful_in_blacksburg/,Are snow tires needed or useful in Blacksburg?,/r/blacksburg/comments/65hdvp/are_snow_tires_needed_or_useful_in_blacksburg/dgab7rc/,5,r/blacksburg,0,5

"One other semi-related comment I wanted to add. For those who have attended an Up on the Roof event (2017 season kicks off this month on top of Kent Square on Thursday, April 27th), you will see how many non-undergrads there are that hang out.  

Anywhere from 200-600 people will be on the roof, enjoying beer, food samples and live music, yet you always wonder where does everyone go the rest of the month?  

And, I think you can find a lot of these same people downtown during the weekends, you don't realize they're not undergrads. Everyone is spread out in different bars / restaurants having a good time, but we all assume their all undergrads.  

I guess my point is a lot of people talk how young Blacksburg skews and how you can get old really quick since there are so many college kids, however there is a good population and growing number of young professionals, grad students, late 20/early 30 somethings that still like to have a good time. There are just not many events centered around this demographic other than monthly Up on the Roof and the Blacksburg Young Professionals events.

"Depends on what items you are after, I don't think Walmart is offering the 1 hour in stock guarantees like they've done now the past few years...at least I didn't see it advertised in their ad this year. If you are going after a popular item I would get there at least 1 hour to 1 hour and a half before the sale starts.

Last year was my first time going to this Walmart and we got there late and were after mostly movies and games, we also had to wait in line for awhile but it wasn't too unbearable. We went to Target afterwards to look around as well, they had a system for their line set up last year so that it weaved around the pet/cleaning supply aisles so the front wouldn't get too bombarded with people, I remember that line went by fairly quick, not as long as we waited in line in Walmart anyway.

Keep in mind though that the mall is not opening this year on Thursday, so whatever crowd usually goes there will probably cause bigger crowds than usual at the stores that are going to be open.",t2_fhpb2,MakinPancakes77,0,1479828713.0,0,t1_dab1ntb,dab1ntb,True,I_love_subway,t3_5e1ay4,https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksburg/comments/5e1ay4/black_friday_advice/,Black Friday advice,/r/blacksburg/comments/5e1ay4/black_friday_advice/dab1ntb/,1,r/blacksburg,0,1
"They repaved Tall Oaks Dr itself about a year before they did Heather Dr, and it took them a little over a week to complete the work IIRC.  To this day, it's still very smooth (even though both BT and Montgomery Co Public School buses run on that road).  I wonder which company they contracted with to do the Tall Oaks job?  Because, as far as I can tell, it's nothing short of excellent.

In contrast, they took at least 3 weeks to do the same thing with Heather Dr and, even, after it was completed, they left cones out for several more weeks making the travel lanes unnecessarily narrow along the whole length of Heather Dr.  Also, like you said, it's anything but smooth.

"I went to a small,  military boarding school in PA for high-school,  as did a kid from NJ,  Matt Laporte. He was the only cadet to die in the April 16th shootings at VT.  During his memorial service at my school,  cadets  faculty and staff all talked about how loving,  kind,  strong and upstanding he was. These traits in him were derived from his training, which started at Carson Long and were further developed in the  Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets.  At that moment,  I decided that he was the kind of person I wanted to be,  and the best way of realizing this was to follow in the same training.  I applied early decision as soon as I was able to the Corps of Cadets and accepted their offer without visiting the campus.  I arrived my freshman year for New Cadet Week,  and immediately felt a sense of belonging that was missing in my 14 moves as a child (dad was in the air force).  VT is the greatest and most defining 'rash'  choice I have ever made.  I will never regret signing up to it blindly. 

Tech will always be home,  no matter where my own career in the Air Force takes me.  Blacksburg will always be my home,  even though I will travel the world. I am not homesick when I am away from Blacksburg,  as leaving its campus is a privilege Matt and 31 others will never have. NeVer forgeT.

"The housing market on Cburg and Bburg are driven by local colleges so the options can be ""meh."" Driving between the 2 burgs us no big deal, except on football days. But the commute from these towns to Roanoke can be brutal especially  if there is  bad weather, or any trouble on 81 (accidents, construction, etc). The back road options are 11 which can be slow if you hit lights a lot, or the windy roads thru catawba (785 or 622). 

My husband did the Burg to Roanoke commute for 4 years and hated it, the truckers are heavy on 81, with lots of slow left hand lane drivers, and he got side swiped in the last few months, totaling his car. The windy back road made me nervous as hell because of poor visibility, bad drivers, occasional dogs or livestock in the roads, etc.

If the new job is temporary, I would weigh how much you hate moving vs commuting. If it is permanent, I would move to one if the burgs or nearby.

"First, welcome to Blacksburg!  

One major difference my friends and I have always noticed between Roanoke and Blacksburg is the average age of people hanging out. While in Roanoke, you can out and see people of all ages having a good time, in Blacksburg in the downtown area, obviously because of Virginia Tech, the age is skewed way down to the early 20s and you can feel a bit old even in your late 20s, but I promise there are a lot of people hanging out who are out-of-college they just don't all hang out in the same places.  

As far as how/where to meet people my main suggestion would be to volunteer either at local events or organizations and get involved. I've met a ton of really cool people that way.  

Here's some specific suggestions:  

+ The Fun-N-Games sounds like it might a great fit for you given your enjoyment of all things geekery.  

+ If you're a game E-Sports Lounge (http://www.theesportslounge.com/) located in University Mall with Fun-N-Games could also be a spot.  

+ There's also a group called Hacksburg (http://hacksburg.org/about.html) in the VT Corporate Research Center that is the community's makerspace and hosts numerous events and allows you to work on projects from robots to rocking chairs and will provide assistance.  

+ There's also a local high-powered rocket club in New River Valley Rocketry (http://nrvr.org/) if that's something you're into that holds rocket launches across the area.  

+ This one is getting a little a way from the geekery and that's the Laser Tag Club at Virginia Tech (https://www.facebook.com/groups/161393457209780/). They generally hold free outdoor laser tag matches every week or so and provide all the equipment and all ages are welcome to join them. 

+ As far as volunteer opportunities, the Blacksburg Partnership hosts the 2 biggest alcohol related events in Fork & Cork (Wine & Spring) and Brew Do (Beer & Oct. 8th this year) and are always in search of volunteers for their events plus you get in for free and get a t-shirt. (Volunteer link: http://www.blacksburgbrewdo.com/volunteer/)  

+ Downtown Blacksburg, Inc. (http://downtownblacksburg.com) hosts the biggest non-football event in Steppin' Out (early August) as well as Summer Solstice (June) and numerous others. They are also always in need of volunteers for their events.  

+ As far as charitable organizations and volunteering go, we have the United Way NRV (http://www.unitedwaynrv.org/), Christmas Store (http://www.mcchristmasstore.org/) and a lot of others. VolunteerNRV (http://volunteer.truist.com/uwmrf/volunteer/) might be a good central location to see what volunteer opportunities there are and from what other organizations.  

+ My other suggestion would be to go and participate in the local events happening. Find something that sounds like fun and most people you meet should share a common interest. Here's where I'm going to plug my website NextThreeDays.com where we list all the fun local events that people share with us or we find happening in the New River Valley. (Link to our page of big, upcoming events: http://www.nextthreedays.com/featuredevents.cfm)  

I'm sure I'm leaving out a lot, but these should provide you with a good starting point. Again welcome to Blacksburg and let us know if you have any other questions.

Edit: 

Other than Brew Do, I didn't touch on suggestions for where to find a good pint. The Tap Takeovers are a great starting point. My favorite bars for a good beer in no particular order are 622 North, Blacksburg Taphouse, Rivermill, London Underground & The Cellar (and again I'm probably leaving someone out). Also as far as bars go, London Underground generally tends to have not as many college students if that's something you're looking for.  

Blacksburg Beer Stores:  

+ Vintage Cellar (https://www.vintagecellar.com/) - Has free beer tastings every Friday and occasionally other times during the week and also sells growlers. Has lots of hard to find beers.  

+ The Cellar Six-Pak Store (http://www.the-cellar.com/six-pak-store/) Connected to The Cellar Restaurant and also has hard to find beers and is located downtown.  

Blacksburg Breweries:  

While we don't have as many as Roanoke, we do have three.

+ Bull & Bones (http://www.bullandbones.com/) - 1st brewery in Blacksburg is located in the First & Main Shopping Center.

+ Lefty's Grille & Right Mind Brewery (http://www.leftysgrille.com/brewery/) - Located off of South Main Street. Newest brewery and part of the Lefty's restaurant.

+ Rising Silo Brewery (http://www.risingsilobrewery.com/) - Located about 3 miles from the University City Mall area however it feels like you're out in the middle of the country. Is a farm brewery that is both pet and family friendly.

"Thanks for the info! That's awesome background.

I do disagree with you that some of the Ukrops blame should be laid at the city's feet.  That area wasn't just saturated, but a little over-saturated with 2 large groceries nearby.  It really didn't need a Ukrops there. If they had built down 220, where the new big Walmart is, that would have made more sense.

This isn't the first time they've done that either: They let WinDixie build a store on Plantation right across from FoodLion. It closed in less than a year. It sat empty for several years until Walmart tore it down and built a market there.  

I know in both these cases there were non-local forces at work, but the city should do *some* due diligence to ensure there isn't going to be a useless empty building sitting there in the event they close, especially when tax credits are in play.",t2_3a5hz,eggoeater,0,1473696818.0,0,t1_d7jp0cz,d7jp0cz,False,Freudianslipups,t3_524p2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksburg/comments/524p2b/old_aamco_lot/,Old AAMCO lot?,/r/blacksburg/comments/524p2b/old_aamco_lot/d7jp0cz/,1,r/blacksburg,0,1

"Close but not quite. The S. Main Kroger came about in a trade. After Leggett's department store (now Belk) moved to the New River Valley Mall, Gables Shopping Center was going into a bit of a decline. Harris Teeter came in, torn down the section where Leggett's was and some of the adjacent storefronts to build a high-end grocery store. It did OK, but the whole chain was struggling in Virginia. Kroger was having some of the same problems with its North Carolina stores. A deal was worked out to ""trade"" stores, with Kroger turning over its properties in North Carolina to Harris Teeter and HT doing the same with Kroger in Virginia. It worked out well for both chains, as evidenced by the continued operation of the S. Main Kroger much as it was when Harris Teeter left.

Ukrops is a different issue. The company did invest heavily to build a store in Roanoke as a move outside its Richmond base. The store did OK, but the whole chain went belly up a couple of years ago. After trying to decide what to do with the space (construction of which was financed with tax dollars/tax credits), the city worked out a deal with Carillion to move offices in there. The failure wasn't on the city and its shoppers, it was on Ukrop's. The nearby Fresh Market (in Towers Shopping Center) is doing a great business.

I can't figure out the obsession with Trader's Joe's. I've been to one and it seemed like a lot of what it carried was overpriced organic food -- overpriced because it had ""Trader Joe's"" on the package, not because it was any better or different from what you can find at Kroger or the Fresh Market. I have also been to a Sprouts Farmers Market (seems to be a Phoenix chain) and it was much nicer than the Trader Joe's.

Parking was never a huge issue, sometimes some issues with folks not picking up after their dogs. pool and gym were nice. Laundry cards were a bit of a pain, but not too bad since you can pay online.

"DirecTV is great for sports (NFL Sunday Ticket is still awesome), but is very expensive. You're better off with a Comcast TV/Internet bundle if you're really wanting TV. I know people hate on Comcast a lot (for good reason), but I never had any issues when I was at WH.

Again, the invasion of privacy concern, I would argue, is moot. That clause is there for both their protection, as well as just an empty threat to scare people and reduce the likelihood of dealing with drugs in their complex. If you're really worried, look up VA tenant/landlord rights.

"I'm currently living in WH, here is my input.
I've never heard any parties, doesn't mean they aren't happening, I've just never heard any. In my opinion, WH is one of the quietest communities (they do allow pets though, so there's always a possibility of dogs barking, etc. Hasn't been a problem for me, just something to keep in mind). From what I remember, they have ""quiet hours"" from 10 pm-10 am, 7 days a week. Now I'm not about to throw a rager in my 1 BR, but I've never had issues when I've had a few friends over.

As far as I know, they've never been in my apartment without more than 24 hours notice, and that's typically just been maintenance type stuff. I haven't ever personally seen any police dogs, but I'm typically not home during the day so I don't know for sure.

Parking is at will with parking passes for residents (except for 1 building that I think has assigned spaces, which as far as I can tell is due to the fact that there are less spaces around that particular building). Technically they can tow non residents, but the people in the office told me they pretty much only tow if they're having issues with people parking there for football games, and they give residents a heads up days in advance so if you're going to have guests you can get them a guest pass. I was there about 2 months before I even bothered to get my parking pass with no issues, and haven't heard of them towing since I've moved in (~9 months ago). I never have trouble finding a space close to my building.

I'd agree with what BurningMoose said for utilities costs, my electric is a little lower because I'm in a 1 BR, but I have the den in my apt as well, so for heating/cooling it's only slightly smaller than a 2 BR w/o den. My water is roughly half what they said. I have Comcast for TV/internet.",t2_vizdk,wubalubadubscrub,0,1461097045.0,0,t1_d29c2yj,d29c2yj,True,bupps5,t3_4fi7v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksburg/comments/4fi7v0/does_anyone_here_live_at_windsor_hills_looking/,Does anyone here live at Windsor Hills?

"Thanks for the info. I was thinking it was an unenforceable law, but was not sure. I'm not worried about the dogs scratching so much as I am the invasion of privacy.

"I last lived there in 2012, so things may have changed.

There were parties, but not really the typical loud/obnoxious party. It's fairly quiet pretty much all the time.

That clause is unenforceable in terms of ""we're entering your apartment unannounced to do a drug sweep"". VA landlord law states that any entry into your rental MUST be announced, with at least 24 hours notice. Add to that the entire illegal search stuff. It's legalese to scare people to not do drugs in the apartments. However, in common areas, such as the stairwells, they are free to bring in drug dogs to detect anything. If a dog scratches at your door, that IS considered probable cause for an immediate search without a warrant.

Parking is at will, with no assigned spaces. If you get home late, don't be surprised to have to park away from your apartment. Overall, I never had an issue finding parking, even if it did require me to park by a different building.

I had Comcast for internet, and DirecTV (for a while with my roommate). Utilities were around $110 a month for electricity, and roughly $30-$40 (at most) for water.

As for the utilities, these may have changed (again, I lived there in 2012).",t2_9hiys,BurningMoose,0,1461094019.0,0,t1_d299o4j,d299o4j,True,bupps5,t3_4fi7v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksburg/comments/4fi7v0/does_anyone_here_live_at_windsor_hills_looking/,Does anyone here live at Windsor Hills?

"So here are my favorite nearby outdoor things. The pandapas pond trail system. I live in town and can run or bike there from my house. Mules of well maintained trails. 

The AT  is less than an hour's drive away. Some of the best parts of the whole trail are nearby.

In the other direction is the blue Ridge Parkway. It is lovely for drives, picnics, and hiking. Astoundingly beautiful. You can spend all day tooling around. Go have lunch or dinner at chateau morrisette. 

The cascades is a popular hike and worth going to in all 4 seasons.



Living:  if I were a grad student with a bike I would live in fox Ridge. It has a pool and gym and all that shut plus it has a bike trails system that directly hooks up to vet's trails and the Huckleberry Trail. The BT (bus system) hooks up well there too.  (The bus is super safe and clean and free for students and has bike racks)

The is also some new place on Merrimac Rd. That is super nice. It is out of town, but right on the Huckleberry and so nice.

Another great option is living in houses within town. There are so ooooh many cute little houses for rent throughout town.  And as far as I know there aren't any unsafe sections of town within town limits.

"Narrows = ""Nars""

To echo what everyone else said, Blacksburg is more interesting and has better schools and restaurants, but is expensive. Narrows, Giles County, Christiansburg are much cheaper.  Giles is a beautiful county and has lots to offer in terms of hiking, camping, climbing, and caving.  The Appalachian Trail goes through the county.  

As for housing, everywhere is safe.  Any place you choose will be beautiful and full of kind people with fun things to do nearby.

Like others said, the same house in Blacksburg will cost up to a few hundred dollars more in rent than a house in Pearisburg, Newport, or anywhere outside of Blacksburg. Bburg is a super housing bubble.

Blacksburg is the place that people outside of Blacksburg go to eat out. Food is more pricey here but there's lots of variety. Other things to do are to hike(!), go visit the VT campus...and eat I guess, haha.

They're pretty good about getting snow off the roads once it stops snowing. Buy some food and stuff in case you get snowed in for a day or two. For your house you'd want the usual snow shovel (or blower), road salt, etc. If you end up in a more rural area you'll want to consider a 4-wheel drive vehicle, and even snow tires.

"Yeah, tech wise you won't have a problem.  VA Tech is a top rated engineering school with a large computer science dept and Darpa is there too so there's a large tech community.   Blacksburg was also the original electronic village which was one of the first town internet integrated areas in the country.  They sadly didn't keep it up but the base and desire is still there. 


Well paying tech jobs though are few and far between though.  You come here with a job and don't come here looking for one unless you're willing to get underpaid.  


Blacksburg is part of the New River Valley which includes the town of Christiansburg (5-10 mins away) and the town of Radford (15-20 mins away).  Either one, if you can handle a longer commute, has a much more reasonable cost of living especially for rentals. Renting is also considerably cheaper as you get further from either University.  At one time I was renting a 1 BR in Radford with all utilities for $550 and it wasn't in a bad part of town.  


Politics wise Blacksburg is considered blue, the rest of the area is pretty firmly red.  Blacksburg is considered a friendly liberal paradise compared to the rest of the area.  Blacksburg is considered LGBT friendly but it's not as accepted even here compared to a large liberal city. The blue oasis is surrounded by a sea of red after all.  


Blacksburg has the most diverse range of places to eat but the majority of shopping and chain restaurants are in Christiansburg.  Blacksburg downtown is recovering and has some specialty shops now. Also have the only IMAX in the entire region.  Roanoke is around 35 mins away and the closest ""real"" airport.  Even then you're probably going to a different airport like Greensboro or Charlotte.  


No problem with student and local integration. Half the population of Blacksburg and prob a quarter of Radford are transient students.  


Plenty to do if you love the outdoors. We border multiple national parks, have the New River Gorge a couple hours away and the AT and the Blue Ridge Parkway are each around 20- 30 mins away. Lots of gyms, small but active college town nightlife and it's around 3 hours to the closest major city and international airport(Charlotte).  College football is big.  


Crime rate is very low compared to the natl average. Taxes are a little high but utilities tend to run much cheaper than larger areas. Internet is limited but high speed is available from Comcast. No FIOS or fiber. Verizon is the best cell coverage outside of the towns, any would work in the towns. 


Weather is good, lots of rain so it stays green (even when other parts of VA are in drought), have 4 real seasons, snow isn't too bad and only shuts stuff down for a couple days when it's bad.  


Traffic is exceptional compared to a large city. A 30 min commute prob means you're driving 25-30 miles not 5 miles. 


Washington DC is around 5.5 hours away, the beach is around 6.

"We've been getting the CSA from Water Bear for several years now and love it. It's a awesome value and your supporting an awesome farmer who grows amazing produce. They deliver to a health food store called Annie Kay's on south main since the farm is in Floyd. So super convenient.  Www.waterbearfarm.com

Basically, there are lots of good local food options here. So that's a huge plus. And water isn't an issue to grow crops :) so big plus to the area!

Also lots of hiking and outdoors stuff. If your into climbing some of the first great sport climbs were set just 1.5 hrs in the new river gorge. And red river gorge is just 6 hours away, it's basically an outdoor gym.  

However the music scene can be lacking if your not into bluegrass. Floydfest is an awesome music festival but is pricey. All depends what you like, but bigger names rarely come closer than 3-4 hours from here (DC, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, which are also your closest, bigger airport with generally cheaper flights).

"Hey! Thanks so much, that was such an informative and helpful answer.

Do you think it's possible to get decent places for cheaper than what you have? I was aiming for tops $600 for rent + utilities, which I guess would be doable depending on the neighborhood. May I ask which part of town you live in?

Also how long have you lived in Blacksburg? I'm curious why you haven't had a lot of chances to meet people. What sort of events in Christiansburg and Blacksburg are you talking about? I saw that there are some areas to go hiking, that sounds fun. Also reassuring to hear you think it's pretty tolerant community.

I'm coming from the Bay Area. I grew up here and then went to the rural midwest for school, so I think it would an easier transition for me than others who have lived in the Bay Area or similar places their whole lives, but Blacksburg still seems different from where I went to college.

In terms of what I like to do. I'm rather introverted, my ideal hang out is one-on-one talking over dinner out or at home, going on a hike or roaming around town looking at stores. I like to read and work out and I'm into talking about social and political issues. I played sports in college and might look into joining an intramural team of some sort, but team environments are almost the only kind in which I've found I can deal with a large group of people and maintain reasonable energy for socializing.

I'm looking at a tech job, and I imagine there isn't a huge tech community in Blacksburg? I don't need one, I'm really more interested in making friends who I can do the above mentioned things with and also try new things. But it would definitely be cool to meet people with similar intellectual interests as me.",t2_u291i,babydinorawr_,0,1453590649.0,0,t1_cz9f2ld,cz9f2ld,False,babydinorawr_,t3_42c96c,https://www.reddit.com/r/blacksburg/comments/42c96c/considering_to_moving_to_blacksburg_from/,Considering to moving to Blacksburg from California - help me fill in the blanks?,/r/blacksburg/comments/42c96c/considering_to_moving_to_blacksburg_from/cz9f2ld/,2,r/blacksburg,0,2
"Hey dude, hopefully I can answer your questions. I'm originally from southern California, I left for college and after several years I've ended up here. I live in a 2 bedroom townhouse with one other guy and the rent total is $1150. Internet+propane+electric+water/trash comes to under $200 every month. So each of us ends up paying <$675/month. 
Gas has been between $1.60 and $2.00 since I've been here.
Food is priced about the same as everywhere else, you can get by pretty cheap if you eat at home. 
The college community is decent, I haven't had a lot of chances to try and get out to meet people. There's events in Christiansburg and Blacksburg pretty often where you can meet people. 
There's a lot of bars here, and places to go hiking. There's a theater here on campus that has lots of concerts and stuff. 
There's a huge variety of worldviews here, people are very accepting of others mostly because the school brings people from so many places/walks of life.
