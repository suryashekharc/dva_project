">but if someone has property, how do you remember to pay the property tax since last i checked, they only send out one notice a year, with the two payment stubs

It's called being a responsible adult and it's really not that difficult, same with insurance (both car and house).

My house is paid for so I have to pay those things on my own. I know when my insurance and tabs are due, and property taxes are always half by the end of April and the other half by end of October (or all in April).

I'm not trying to be an asshole but there are a few things you just don't forget, insurance being the number one thing you never go without. I guess my Dad did a great job of drilling that stuff into my brain. Car insurance wasn't required when I started driving but my Dad would not let me near a car without having insurance. He also explained to me what could happen if I had an at fault accident with no insurance (financial ruin).

A house is most peoples biggest asset so I don't know how anybody could forget to pay the insurance or taxes, you are sitting on something worth $500k to over a million. That is an asset that you really need to protect.

I guess having at least a sort of budget helps to remember those things. I know what months I'll have extra bills for insurance and taxes so I always plan that out ahead of time.

They simply don't exist for a 28 year old unless you want to bust your ass, and even then Seattle (or the entire metro area) is a nonstarter.

"Ok then: 

SPU is on the North side of Queen Anne. Queen Anne's a great neighborhood, but quite Richie Rich. 

Magnolia is nearby: it's actually become quite reasonably priced, relatively speaking. And it's in an Eden for quiet, easygoing city living, as well as being very close to the best and biggest park in the city (Discovery Park).

Ballard is north across the ship canal from Magnolia.  It's a big neighborhood (goes north all the way to 85th), with something to offer for pretty much whatever you're looking for: it's got quite neighborhoods, it's got shopping and retail, it's got restaurants and bars....

Just to the north of SPU (and east of Ballard) across the ship canal is the Fremont neighborhood.  Fremont likes to think it's special. I think it's mostly just expensive. But there's something going on there most of the time.

To the east of Fremont along the ship canal is the Wallingford neighborhood (where I live).  This is mostly sleepy single family homes occupied by Microsoft and Amazon tech workers. The whole neighborhood's like living in a big garden (especially in the springtime, look out for the hummingbirds).

North from there are some really nice neighborhoods that will vary a bit in price: Green Lake, Phinney Ridge (where the city zoo is located), and Greenwood.  Given the realities of traffic in seattle, I don't think you would want to live too much further north than these neighborhoods...

Places to avoid: the Aurora/Hwy99 corridor, Lower Queen Anne/Belltown, Southlake, downtown.

"Been going on forever. Doing the same shit over and over and trying to save people who don't want to be saved doesn't work. Can you save a drug addicted person who isn't willing to quit? The answer is no. They need to focus on the people actually trying and stop enabling the fuckers who don't. I walked past an encampment the other day where a guy was talking about all the crap he was going in his ""free"" house. I know I'm tired of struggling to make ends meet and if I asked for help, the government would say I make too much money. If I was some fuck who sat on my ass and refused to work, I get free money, free shelter and a free pass on criminal activities. Yes the government has failed. It continues to fail the people actually try, putting into the system and enabling people who wouldn't do shit for themselves. Get to the homeless people working and trying and work from there.

"Yeah, well, what you're saying doesn't even matter. As it stands, it's housing first and that's it. There are an extremely limited amount of programs available to actually help the *source* of the problem with these individuals. 

But, the homeless issue is a big money maker. So let's do the houses. And it's not going to work. And that's because they can still do whatever the fuck they want, and there are no services to help them.

Honestly I'm tired of opinions similar to yours. You might have swayed me 10 years ago. Not anymore. Tired of this compassion bullshit and delivering a bow tie package with a simple piece of paper saying ""would you accept help?"" And when the ""no"" box is ticked, they just continue on their marry way. Over a decade, over a billion dollars. Nothing achieved besides lining pockets. Can we try something different now? 

Maybe you and the politicians should watch Intervention.

It's like no one who has the power to change this has any kids. Or seen any drug abuse. I'm fucking tired of it. Why are we giving into entitled fucks who don't want change? THEYRE BEING CONTROLLED by their drug abuse or mental illness. Their brain is literally telling them to defend the continuation of what they are doing. 

Yes, my 4 year old is going to kick and scream before going to bed. Too. Fucking. Bad. It's time for bed. A homeless person is going to bitch and moan about getting clean. Too fucking bad. Stay in this nice little house and turn your life around, or go to fucking jail. You can't stay on the streets. TOO BAD. (Again, not like any of this matters because we're going to drop buckets of money on housing with no bother to treat their issues)

"They mean *the* Eastside. It is the more family orientated string of cities east of Lake Washington.

Redmond and Issaquah are also family friendly with the need to commute. Farther out of Redmond has some less expensive places, and Issaquah has some ""moderately"" priced (again it is relative) stuff near its little downtown and the highlands.


This area ticks the boxes of good schools and parks without an emphisis on night life as stereotypical suburbs. The commute will suck, especially to SPU.

"Why do you think that criminals, drug dealers and junkies should be able to just show up in an expensive city and do whatever they want unchecked? I live nearby and walk close to this place frequently. I often see strung out drug addicts walking to and from this encampment to get their fix. I have seen them high out of their minds on their way back from this encampment because they couldn't wait to get back to their tent to get high. I've even seen them do it at the Delridge community center park with a playground of toddlers and skate park full of teens nearby. 

But no, of course people shouldn't have to be responsible for their actions in any way whatsoever... After all, society is oppressing them!! Even if they are white males getting high on meth in a park full of children.

"Oh wow... I don't think $600k would even get you an outdated 2 bedroom 1 bath condo in that area. $3k/mo can get you a 2 bed apartment. I would look at Phiney Ridge because it is cute, close enough to those universities, and there is a big zoo. However, going farther north will get you more bang for your buck, and Phiney Ridge has more single fanily homes than apartments. Due to your lowish pricepoint ($2k/mo could get a fine 1 bedroom), be wary of anything too close to Hwy 99, especially as you get north of the zoo. $2.5k/mo is a realistic goal if you want a bedroom for the kid in north Seattle. $3k/mo might get you a smaller house for rent. Note all pricepoints mentioned are before utilities--might break the bank for even a small house. Realistically, you might find yourself relegated to Lynnwood for a rental.

">This year, as in recent years, “the single biggest increase is in homicides with a homeless nexus,” where the victim, suspect, or both are experiencing homelessness, or a killing occurs in a homeless encampment, Nollette said.

>Those cases account for an estimated 40% of the homicide unit’s case load — and that nexus was evident in three of the four homicides committed during that single week in March, she said.  
>  
>“When I say ‘homeless,’ it’s a misnomer — it’s really narcotics activity, mental health issues and lawlessness,” said Nollette. “We’re seeing the violence centered on illegal encampments, where there’s a general sense of lawlessness that concentrates bad actors and concentrates narcotics in one area.”

"Here's the prepared full veto explanation, for anyone curious:

 >Engrossed Senate Bill 5901 establishes a new sales and use tax deferral program for investment in manufacturing or research and development operations projects. It also expands the existing warehouse sales and use tax exemption to include smaller warehouses that are at least 100,000 square feet. Both of these tax incentives are only available in counties with a population greater than 650,000.

>I recognize that manufacturing and warehousing are important components of the state's rural economy, but the tax incentives in this bill are overly broad. The legislatively stated intent of this bill was to establish a tax deferral program to be effective solely in certain targeted counties outside of the central Puget Sound region. This bill does not accomplish this goal, as currently 36 of Washington's 39 counties would be considered qualifying areas for these incentives based on the population limit established in the bill. Additionally, due to the increasing consumer preference for online shopping over the past few years, which only increased with the pandemic, the warehousing industry has remained strong and does not require an expanded tax incentive program to remain competitive at this time.

"Yep, it’s fine.  She was saying my whole childhood that she was only raising me out of her obligation to.  That when I’d turn 18, she’d kill herself, or she’d dissappear and become a bag lady.  She’d also throw temper tantrums and lock herself in the bathroom with a knife so that I’d beg her to not kill herself.  I’d wake up to her passed out in puddles if her own puke, or not even home.  These kinds of parents also make themselves out to be the victim of their kids to the rest of the family to hide the abuse, so I had to go no contact with the whole family as soon as I could get away.  Then I found out as an adult that her five siblings are also estranged from eachother.  

I wrote a few more things about her on my profile yesterday if any one is looking to read more pity porn, lol.

"1. Who said they're right leaning?

2. Hard not to make this a left vs right when king county is a one party city with full control, and that party has been mismanaging this problem for over a decade. 

Not like your posts gives off any sense of logic or balance in matters so I'm not sure why I'm commenting., but the truth is we need an equilibrium. A balance. We need the left to shoot off their progressive ridiculous ideas, and the right to come in to soften those ideas to a more central method. 

Without any conservative input whatsoever, this is the result of full left wing progressive control. You don't have to pay your car tabs, you don't have to stop for a traffic violation (floor the gas, you get a jail free card), drug use is legal, shitting on the street and wacking people with hammers and bats is a minor inconvenience, etc. 

**You don't need to require any better example than what's right in front of your face that we need political balance in a society.**

And what's *really* sad is...there are left leaning and right leaning politicians here that could do some great things but radicals refuse because they aren't hard left enough.

I get the drift you never went to a food bank. You can only go to the food bank in your district needing to verify your address with a utility or electric bill to even get into the system. Then you can only shop between certain times. If you're not there early on those days, you may not get a spot in the line to get food at all. And yes they check you in every time, verifying your last visit. In some food banks you can only show up every two weeks and your visits are tracked so you can't get food outside these guidelines. 
Now tell me again how you feed yourself out of a banana box size cardboard box filled half full with one meat, maybe 4 potatoes, some vegetables maybe some apples, a jug of milk, some cheese a loaf of bread, thats it. If you do get hygiene products you'll get a roll of toilet paper and hotel size bottles of soap shampoo or detergents. Since covid there is no open shopping anymore as before.

"I'm a utilitarian about this, most good for the most people. High housing costs are THE cause of this cities woes. Why do all houses sell way above list without any contingency, high housing costs. Why will crackerboxes go for 2200/month, high housing costs. Why do landlords break the law with impunity, high housing costs. Why are people criminals or otherwise living on the street, high housing costs. To focus only on the most visible homeless and act like that is the only problem is to ignore the ENTIRE problem. I dislike what I see on the streets as much as the next guy. But, to treat that as the only problem is to ignore entire problem, the rent is too damn high. Your view of things would be like if someone saw a hurricane approaching and was like ""damn better put a rain coat on, and do nothing else"". If we focus on lowering housing costs then life will get better for everyone. If we focus only on criminalizing the visible homeless but continue to let housing prices skyrocket there will necessarily be more homeless and crime. Making this city affordable would be good for everyone and I want to see the most good for the most number of people.

"OLYMPIA — The veto pen struck again.

For the past few years, Gov. Jay Inslee has irked his fellow Democrats with some of his vetoes, prompting outcries and even lawsuits from legislative leaders for his more creative applications of executive authority.

This week, the governor kept it simple, issuing a standard partial veto of Senate Bill 5901, intended to spur economic development through tax incentives.

Nonetheless, Inslee’s veto prompted bursts of frustration yet again from Democratic lawmakers — and showed just how central tax preferences are to Washington politics and policy.

In SB 5901, Democrats thought they had a good idea to spur investment in rural Washington: a new sales and use tax deferral program to boost the construction of some large warehouse projects across most of Washington’s 39 counties.

Currently, tax deferral programs of this type only exist in King County, according to a fiscal analysis of the legislation.

Sponsored by Sen. Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, SB 5901 also capped the sales tax exemptions for the construction or expansion of warehouses or grain elevators to
$400,000, according to a legislative analysis.

The bill passed the Legislature with bipartisan majorities and was co-sponsored by moderate and progressive Democrats, a conservative Republican and Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane.

But on Thursday, Inslee rejected a swath of the bill, including parts that expanded the sales tax deferral on large projects across much of the state, and the $400,000 cap.

“I could not justify thinking that it was a good investment for Washingtonians to subsidize warehouse owners, when every time I turn around I see a new warehouse,” Inslee said in a question-and-answer session with reporters.

The governor had actually intended to go even further and veto the entire bill, and even prepared the explanation of the full veto. But shortly before Thursday’s bill signing, the governor’s office decided to keep part of the legislation.

The reason? Because part of the legislation might benefit a clean-energy project the governor is seeking to lure to Washington.

“There was a provision in there that could be important to a high-tech manufacturer in the clean-energy space,” Inslee said, when asked about the change to a partial veto.

“It’s very important to get that company to Washington state, and it would be a very large entity and would help in our clean energy, as well,” he added.

The state is actively trying to recruit that company, according to Inslee spokesperson Jaime Smith. Asked about which company the state is trying to lure, Smith referred questions to the state Department of Commerce.

In an email, spokesperson Penny Thomas wrote that, “as you can imagine, throughout an active recruitment project we are not at liberty to share many specific details, especially the company identity.”

The veto prompted frustration from Randall, who is expected to have one of the most competitive Senate races this fall.

“Now, with this partial veto, SB 5901’s impact will not expand beyond the biggest warehouses in King County, and the smaller facilities and businesses — like those that might grow and scale at the Port of Bremerton’s industrial park — will not see the benefits of this tax exemption,” Randall said in prepared remarks. “I am extremely disappointed in the governor’s decision to ignore the needs of our more rural local economies.”

In a statement, Billig said he was disappointed and called the veto “misguided.”

“The portion of the bill that he vetoed would have saved the state millions of dollars by narrowing a tax exemption used by the largest warehouse developers and, at the same time, provided more opportunity for smaller businesses to benefit from the tax exemption,” he said in prepared remarks.",t2_bd4u6g2q,OutlandishnessOk1255,0,1648921631.0,0,t1_i34rb4d,i34rb4d,True,OutlandishnessOk1255,t3_tuoojz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tuoojz/inslee_rankles_fellow_democrats_by_vetoing_part/,Inslee rankles fellow Democrats by vetoing part of tax-incentive bill geared toward rural WA,/r/SeattleWA/comments/tuoojz/inslee_rankles_fellow_democrats_by_vetoing_part/i34rb4d/,29,r/SeattleWA,0,29
