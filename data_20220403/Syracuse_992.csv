"Here's my riggie recipie. For what it's worth I grew up in Utica ;)

 These are technically vodka riggies, but you can do it without the vodka just fine, might need to add a bit of water or a little more heavy cream to make up for the loss of liquid. A dry sherry works too. Like, real sherry, not cooking sherry, that stuff is NASTY

Also I typed this out for a person who lacked some cooking skills so it's a little verbose ;)

You will need:

1 box rigatoni pasta

2-3 chicken breasts (depending on size of breast) cut in to roughly 1 inch or smaller cubes

3 tablespoons olive oil

2 tablespoons butter

2 cloves garlic

2-3 shallots (depending on size) (diced)

¾ cup – 1 cup vodka

1 can (14oz) tomato puree

1 cup heavy cream

Hot Cherry Peppers (Jarred is preferred to fresh, in oil preferred to vinegar, but either works. Note they also sell jarred sweet cherry peppers too. Make sure they’re the hot variety)

1 jar (6-8 oz) roasted red sweet peppers (typically located in the same area that the cherry peppers are, near the jarred jalapenos and olives and such).

Basil (either dried or actual leaves)

Oregano is nice too, but optional.

Ground pepper

Italian seasoning

Instructions

Add some olive oil to a skillet that’s big enough to hold the chicken cubes and heat on medium heat.

Once the butter melts, throw in your chicken breast cubes, shake in some of the Italian seasoning to coat the chicken. Cook this until the chicken is just cooked. Stir occasionaly so chicken doesn’t get burned on one side and adjust heat if it’s getting too brown. While that’s going on proceed to step 3

Start making the sauce/pasta. Start a bunch of water boiling and when it reaches a boil cook the rigatoni as per the directions on the box.

Continue to step 4 while this is happening to start working on the sauce.

Get yourself a 12 inch skillet and put in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter. Heat over medium heat until the butter melts. (Note, this skillet must be large enough to hold the chicken and all the sauce, it should be fairly large)

Dice up the shallots and the garlic nice and small and once the butter has melted in the pan throw them in there. Cook them until the shallots get slightly transparent and squishy, probably around 2-3 minutes.

Pour in the Vodka (careful if it’s a gas stove…highly flammable). Let the vodka boil off for 3-4 minutes. Stir around occasionally.

Pepper time. I like adding 3-4 cherry peppers. I generally cut off the top of the pepper where the stem is and pull out all the seeds and discard them. Then cut the pepper up into 1/8ths and throw it into the vodka/shallot mixture.  Vary the number of peppers based on how hot you want it…be careful though, they pack a punch.

For the sweet peppers, drain the oil from the jar and pull them out. Slice them into long, narrow strips. You’re trying to get narrow strips of pepper (sorta like French fry sized). I typically don’t use the entire jar of pepper, you can use your judgement based on how much sweet peppers to add.

Add in the can of tomato puree and stir up the mixture. Reduce heat to low for the sauce skillet. The sauce should turn an orange-y pink color once it’s mixed entirely.

Add in the cup of heavy cream and let the mixture simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring regularly. Around this point your chicken should be pretty much done, so you can just dump it into the sauce pan to simmer with the rest of it.

At this point it gets less scientific. I usually add in a decent helping of pepper and either dried basil leaf flakes or a couple of diced up actual basil leaves. Some oregano is good too. Add your spices, stir it all up and taste frequently and adjust accordingly.

Simmer the sauce until the pasta is finished boiling, then put the pasta in a bowl and pour the sauce over it.

Mix and enjoy. Goes really well with some crusty bread to dip in the leftover riggie sauce.

Chicken Riggies

INGREDIENTS

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup diced onion
* 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, cubed
* 2 red bell peppers, seeded and sliced into thin strips
* 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped
* 1 (28 oz.) can crushed tomatoes
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 1 1/2 cups water
* 16 ounces uncooked rigatoni pasta
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* 1/4 to1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a large deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
2. Add the garlic, onion and chicken and saute until the chicken is just browned and the onions are soft.
3. Stir in the peppers and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
4. Add in the crushed tomatoes, broth and water and bring to a simmer. Carefully stir in the pasta and bring to a low boil. Continue to cook, stirring often, until the pasta is just tender, about 15 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to low and add the butter, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. When the butter completely melts into the pasta, add in the cream and Parmesan cheese.
6. Simmer for 10-15 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender.

I've dated people up that way, and every one is just super neighborly. It's odd out here in Syracuse. People just do not go out of their way to welcome the neighbors.

That's an interesting perspective to have. I've lived in both areas and I can tell you that I much prefer the attitudes of people in Syracuse. Of course, we are both hugely generalizing huge areas, with large groups of differing people, but going along with what you said...

All of the areas you mentioned can be quite stuck up (Pittsford, Victor, Fairport, Penfield). Actually on the whole, Rochester has a bit of an attitude, while also managing a chip on its shoulder of being a great metropolis at one point and constantly trying to keep up with Buffalo. Rather, Syracuse on the whole is quite aware of its shortcomings and is more realistic about who they are. I'm also extremely excited for the direction in which Syracuse is headed.

But to answer OP's question: I've seen how hard it is to make friends in a new city, especially as a mom. Feel free to PM me - I also like exercise/barre, reading and wine. I'm not a mom but have quite a few friends who are and have cultivated a nice group here.

"For the non- subscribers 🤝

""It’s taken a few years longer than expected, but Dave Collins is finally going to open his own brewery-restaurant in Syracuse.

Bullfinch Brewery should open by June at Destiny USA. It will take the spot occupied until March 2020 by Gordon Biersch, a national brewery-restaurant chain that closed in Destiny just before the Covid pandemic.

Like Gordon Biersch, Bullfinch will combine a working brewery with a restaurant and bar, but it will be locally owned by Collins with his own selection of beers and a menu of “updated pub food.” The location is on the first level of Destiny, near the Hiawatha Boulevard entrance.

The planned opening of Bullfinch was confirmed Thursday by Alannah Gallagher, director of marketing for Destiny USA.

It marks a full-circle return for Collins. He was the first brewmaster at the Gordon Biersch in Destiny when it opened in 2012. He installed the brewing equipment for Gordon Biersch that he will now use for Bullfinch.

Collins, who grew up in Marcellus, has nurtured the idea of opening his own place since he was homebrewing more than a decade ago.

“It’s always been my dream,” he said, noting that he still has labels from his homebrew days as far back as 2008 with the word “Bullfinch” on them. The name is a reference to author Thomas Bulfinch, who wrote books on Greek and Roman mythology in the 19th century. “We were always nerds,” Collins said.

His first taste of professional brewing came at the Buffalo Brewpub in Buffalo, and then he enrolled in a brewing school.

He got his first “official” brewmaster job at the Destiny USA Gordon Biersch. He left after a few years to help start the Resurgence Brewing Co., a craft brewery in Buffalo. 

About four years ago, began putting together the idea of his own Bullfinch Brewpub in Syracuse., Initially, it was going to be part of the Iron Pier development in the Inner Harbor that was also going to include a “Brewseum” dedicated to local brewing history.

He was just about to secure a loan a March 2020 when Covid hit. Lots of plans changed at that point.

The Inner Harbor location eventually became a satellite taproom for the Meier’s Creek Brewing Co. of Cazenovia. The Brewseum, a project of the Onondaga Historical Association, found a home last fall at Heritage Hill Brewery in Pompey.

Collins kept plugging away on his dream.

Now that he’s found his location, he’s working on the beer list and looking for a chef and other help.

He expects his beer rotation to feature both “traditional” beers like lagers and hefeweizens and more modern offerings like sours and hazy New England IPAs.

The 15-barrel brewing system is larger than many brewery stat-ups, and has the capability of making many different styles.

At first, the beers will be available on tap only at the brewery, but Collins will explore “squeezing a canning line” in at some point.

“It’s been a long time, with a lot of detours,” Collins said. “But now we can feel it coming along""",t2_fq7przad,wiselyman333,0,1648817430.0,0,t1_i2z6r58,i2z6r58,True,wiselyman333,t3_ttpshw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/ttpshw/bullfinch_brewery_to_open_at_destiny_usa_in/,"Bullfinch Brewery to open at Destiny USA, in former Gordon Biersch Brewery",/r/Syracuse/comments/ttpshw/bullfinch_brewery_to_open_at_destiny_usa_in/i2z6r58/,10,r/Syracuse,0,10

"I’ve lived in three places in Strathmore over the years. I first lived on the corner of Arlington & W Colvin St, that was around 2002-03. It was starting to go downhill East of there on Colvin & south of there on Arlington. A lot of no-muffler traffic would speed through the neighborhood then, using W Colvin/Strathmore Dr/ Twin Hills as a shortcut between South Ave & Geddes St. My flat was amazing but my car was broken into several times there, and I had a gang of trick or treaters force their way into my house to nab the extra Halloween candy they saw in the room behind me. A ton of houses on Arlington & Charmouth seemed to go up for sale during my time there. My former flat looks terrible now, but maybe it’s still nice inside.

Circa 2007-08 (between 03-07, I lived in NYC, moved to Strathmore again on return) I lived on Stinard between Twin Hills & Crossett. I really liked the location there and it was generally very safe except for the time all the street-facing tires of all the cars parked on-street got senselessly slashed. I enjoyed being able to walk to the park & being able to catch the bus to work downtown and not needing to drive.

Then I moved to outer Strathmore, on the west side of Geddes, to Rider Ave on the north side of Stolp. That was a huge mistake. I wanted to have faith in the concept of urban renewal but I never felt safe living there and moved within months.

Generally, I liked Strathmore enough to live there repeatedly. If I were to live there again, here’s where my boundaries would be:

The area of outer Strathmore west of Geddes around Woodland Reservoir is good – between Stolp & Glenwood to the south, bordered by Velasko/Glenwood to the west and Geddes to the east.

In Strathmore proper, I’d stay in the area bordered by Bellevue to the north, Geddes to the west, Glenwood to the south, and Summit to the east. I’d stay away from the area east of Summit around lower Onondaga park.

It’s decent over near Bellevue Country Club too, the triangle bordered by Velasko to the east, Bellevue to the northwest, Glenwood to the southwest.",t2_sdn92,chapstickgrrrl,0,1648758333.0,0,t1_i2w79ur,i2w79ur,False,DeckTheHalls_WithMe,t3_tsjtar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tsjtar/is_washington_square_neighborhood_good/,Is Washington Square Neighborhood good?,/r/Syracuse/comments/tsjtar/is_washington_square_neighborhood_good/i2w79ur/,1,r/Syracuse,0,1

"How about Tipp Hill? I’d bet there are save affordable homes in that area. Eastwood too.

Homes 80-100k in the areas you mention are that cheap for a reason – either the immediate surrounding area is not great, or the house is in disrepair or at least needs significant work done to to. With home prices being so high right now, and being a sellers market, if you can wait a while, maybe 2 years, for a “crash” and more homes being available for sale at cheaper prices, that would benefit you.

If you’re not set on the city, look at USDA Rural Development mortgages. [USDA programs](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/single-family-housing-programs)You can get a house in an area zoned “rural development” according to the USDA map (for example, all of Skaneateles qualifies!) for ZERO money down, and the lowest rate available, if your income meets the qualifications for the income guidelines (up to like 91k/year these days), and you can build any home repairs into the mortgage.

"I think you should move if you can’t find people that match what you want. Go to a big city like NYC or Boston. Would be a lot easier to find what you want there.

Also the people saying to pay money for a site like match.com is funny. It’s very easy to screen a profile and tell if someone is riff raff. 

For wanting to meet people in person and not a dating app- I would try to join some sort of club or meet up group to meet folks with similar interests. Again, Syracuse NY sucks for that. Meet up.com doesn’t have a lot of groups and the folks that are on those sites tend to look kinda odd. 

I would move. If you are a 30 year old female that hasn’t found what she wants (for a female, dating apps should be fake if you ask me if you are half way decent looking and have a career). Sure you gotta screen males that may not be serious/ have serious career ambitions but if you are 30- it might just be you. I would say move and go somewhere that has more young urban professionals where the #s are more in your favor. Ever go to nyc or Boston and flick through a dating app. You ever wonder why you match with a lot more attractive folks? It’s bc in those big cities, the attractive folks aren’t a dime a dozen- it’s going to be much easier to date in the range you want in a big city where you can scroll through hundreds of profiles.

"Ants, any kind of fly (phorid, fungus gnats, drain flies, house flies), spiders (there's a lot of wolf spiders here, or at least where I am. Not a fan). There's a lot of bugs dependent especially on if you are near water. The rivers or ponds etc here will increase your bug count fairly substantially. Dependent upon the season I make sure I don't miss a single crumb because ants can move really fast. Idk if it's the type around me but one ant can turn into a thousand after they find one large crumb. 

Make sure you keep your sinks and toilets etc clean. Phorid flies infest quickly, especially if they discover your drains.

All this then depends on how well your apartment/home is sealed. The apartments aren't usually well built so it's easy for bugs to get a whiff of snacks then come in. If your place is insulated and caulked well and there's not mulch or plants right on top of your foundation and windows you can avoid a lot of bugs. Have to smart about selecting a place (if you have the luxury of a choice in this rental market that is...) and smart about maintaining it.

Note that if you do get bugs in a rental your landlord has to help treat for them.",t2_287do12i,chmt88,0,1648475733.0,0,t1_i2frnq0,i2frnq0,True,peppers29,t3_tq7hp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tq7hp7/rats_roaches_ants_what_is_the_story/,"Rats, Roaches, Ants…?

roaches on the coast are water bugs.  if you have roaches in Syracuse it’s pure uncleanness or trash being around,t2_h5fxn,I_drive_all_over,0,1648471057.0,0,t1_i2fifys,i2fifys,True,peppers29,t3_tq7hp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tq7hp7/rats_roaches_ants_what_is_the_story/,"Rats, Roaches, Ants…?

"I used to deliver appliances way back when, and I saw my fair share of roaches. I will say that the people who had roaches lived like slobs, never saw a roach in a nice place. Living in an apartment obviously increases your odds of getting roaches, so I would look for the obvious signs of an infestation when you do your walk through. 


Being this far north has its advantages, and one being that roaches are not super prevalent here.",t2_dbk0rzep,CugMuzzler,0,1648470342.0,0,t1_i2fh7cx,i2fh7cx,True,peppers29,t3_tq7hp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tq7hp7/rats_roaches_ants_what_is_the_story/,"Rats, Roaches, Ants…?

"We had roaches. We had the apartment fumigate whenever we saw them, stuffed our doors, kept all the lights on, and went through about 3 cans of roach spray. Also just not leaving dishes or any food out. Then we moved lol.

We've had spiders and for that one, you spray them as you see them and then also use Raid Home Defense to form a perimeter.

I lived in a different place where I had like 50 flies (This one was kind of my fault) and we left a light on and used fly strips around it so they'd go there at night. That and removed any source food and my plant where I think the eggs were from. Same place had like 8 different bugs and house centipedes because it was semi-underground. In retrospect I should have used that home defence and sprayed more",t2_10jznh,Lohikaarme27,0,1648468736.0,0,t1_i2fek1i,i2fek1i,True,peppers29,t3_tq7hp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/tq7hp7/rats_roaches_ants_what_is_the_story/,"Rats, Roaches, Ants…?

I’d recommend this route if you can find it. Grant village in Eastwood was willing to do it several years ago but it seems like someone gets shot there every 6 months now.
