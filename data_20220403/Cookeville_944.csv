"It’s an issue at most schools.  If parents ate at many of them on the regular, there would be a lot more outrage.  I’ve only ever worked at one school that had a cafeteria that worked it’s ass off for the students to create great, balanced meals for the kids.  Most, like the current school I work for, serve prepackaged shit loaded with carbs for breakfast, and serve half assed lunches that barely require any effort.  

This has been an issue ever since that Michelle Obama initiative to make lunches healthier.  The idea is sound, but when you don’t create additional funding to help these poorer schools…you are doomed to fail.  You have to buy quality foods, but most schools min/max’d their food budgets by purchasing cheap, like really, really cheap alternatives…and cheap, precooked and pre-packaged “healthy” foods are TERRIBLE, taste wise and most, as I mentioned above, are still loaded with whole wheat carbs because, “WhOlE wHeAt CaRbS aRe hEaLtHy, RiGhT???”

"I'm probably way off base here, but I think the Upper Cumberland, specifically Cookeville, is uniquely positioned to potentially avoid some of the ills of this kind of growth/exposure.

I don't think growth has to be a boom/bust cycle here.   It could very well be sustainable pathway that lifts an entire region out of repeating history of poverty.   

Here are a few things that potentially make this growth different than what has been seen elsewhere:

1.  It's not predicated on the consumption or pricing of a natural resource (ex. oil in North Dakota.)
2. Tennessee Tech is the kind of university you'd find in a much larger town and, with a slight shift in strategy and an increase in the allure of the local area, could allow the area to retain recent graduates as new employees for companies operating in the area.
3. The city straddles one of the nation's great east-west corridors, I-40.
4. Nearly the whole of Putnam County is within one hour of the Nashville International Airport.   It's not Atlanta, but big enough that anyone can get here from wherever there is.
5. The idea that Putnam County is homogeneously white and unwilling to change is fueled by several factors, and some of them reflect poorly on the area.   However, I think the statistic that's reported of the county being \~6% Hispanic is significantly lower than actual.   I don't have anything to base this off of... just gut feeling and anecdotal proof.

This area of the country has needed some hope since manufacturing jobs left en masse starting in the 1980s and the middle class evaporated.   I remain optimistic that the housing boom and the influx of money from outside the county could help.

"I recently went the other direction. Left that area for the ""Big City"" and its been the best decision of my life. In an instant, my salary tripled and even with the higher cost of living ive managed to save enough to buy a house in just 3 years. Additionally im more marketable to employers and have expanded not just my social but professional networks far beyond what would have been possible in the UC. I really miss the area and the people, but the economy is garbage and has a long way to go before it could be considered lucrative to move back that direction. The argument for ""remote work"" will soon dry up and that 1.5 hour commute to Nashville is only valid for the east side of town. Anything past Donelson might take 2 hours or more, and its a brutal commute. Each direction. So best case, 3 hours a day in a car.  

One thing that is left out of the article that i feel is very important is the attitude of most employers in the region. They all act like they are doing you some huge favor for employing you at a starvation wage and expect far more loyalty than they pay for. They also use fear as a means of control - ""You should be happy for this $15/hr! Its tough out there! Good luck finding a better job!"".

"You said, ""I use to see life through your colored glasses but I still maintain some kind of work ethic that I rarely see here in TN"".
Same. I'm from NY. The speed of which we worked up there? The amount of people we dealt with on a daily basis? Would run circles around these people's heads. My last job in NY, on a busy weekend, if we didn't break $100k? It was considered a failure of a weekend. And once again, we can dick measure and I can tell you all about how I worked there a month and was given a supervisor position and in under 3 months total? Offered a position in management. But again, pointless to beat your chest on an online forum and say, ""Look at me! Look at me! I'm successful!"". Just comes across as silly. But that's fairly common Internet etiquette that I don't expect the older crowd to understand 😂

As for the money thing? You would 100% be surprised how much it motivates. Maybe in a blue collar job where people like their craft that also plays a part. But the great resignation is literally about fair wages and proper treatment of employees. It's focused around greedy corporate douches who report highest profits in years despite raising prices and not raising wages for their workers. Also if you think $30k is a liveable wage? You're still out of touch. 

And while I haven't ran my own company? I have been in charge of hiring numerous times. My work in NY employed over 200 people. I sat in and was responsible for deciding and hiring little less than half that. But again, thumping my own chest like a proud gorilla doesn't mean squat here. 

Far as discussing wages? Per my last message if you read carefully...
I mentioned my co-workers who were in the SAME position as myself, doing the SAME amount of work, were not paid fairly. Even when they asked about a raise? They were denied. They had to fight tooth and nail and threaten to quit to get it. Which only worsened relations with our employer. This isn't the old days where you walk up to a factory and as long as you bring a good attitude and a firm handshake, you get hired. This isn't the days of demanding a raise based on your performance. And again, if that's how you run your business? Good for you. But that's not the reality of every day life. As an employer you don't realize the situations new workers are in, you don't understand the process these companies use to hire, distribute raises, and fire people.

"Like I said I don’t disagree with most of your observations. Yes the great resignation isn’t just for employees, it is for customers as well. 👍🤣 I use to see life through your colored glasses but I still maintain some kind of work ethic that I rarely see here in TN. 
Now I see through my employer colored glasses. As an employer, I define what a work ethic is, not you. I adjust my pay according to work ethic, skills and performance. I think all managers should but most are unable.
Loyalty is earned. Profits should be shared. A good work environment is an absolute. Money is a relative thing and it is not a primary motivator no matter what you think. Start your own company and you shall see.
As I told you a living wage is easily found. I think it starts at 30k. 10 per hour isn’t a living wage. Any more than 30k you need to bring a skill with you and good work ethic. How does 75-95 hour sound? Just what would you think you would have to do to earn that? Sit on your cell phone, and wait for the next Facebook buzz?
You are going to have a hard working life, and retirement to going to suck is all I can say.
Don’t for one second think everybody your age thinks like you. Problem is, as an employer you got to go through 6-20 to get 1 good one. The other problem is the capitalist pigs are unwilling to richly reward those good ones. Difference is, I can, so I do.🤣
I didn’t say you could not talk about wages. I stated I never did after that one time. Everybody thinks they should make what you make without doing the work or making an effort. I never had a problem demanding a raise at the appropriate time. 
What skills do you bring to the table that warrants your attitude? Obviously you don’t give a crap about your employer. If they offer 20 dollars will all of a sudden do a reverse course with the bullshit, whoo is me, attitude? I think not.

There is a local company called Bonnell? I hear they pay well but it sounds like hard work?  I know they pay more then 10 and benefits. It’s hot, cold, dirty, sweaty. Is that too good for you? Do you want to start in management with your superior skill set and work you way down?

I don’t think you think about what the employer thinks about during an interview? If you are not getting good offers during a worker storage, thats reflects on you. I ask you to think about that for your own sake.

I don’t think you know the first thing about beng a leader. In turn you probably don’t know anything about team work. One of those that likes to be micromanaged so they can bitch. Ya that’s a sucky ass life. 

While you are declining positions you do have a job? I can’t see how anyone could live on TN unemployeement. This state has the workng class whipped.

"Jaded would be a good way to define my entire generation. And I don't blame 'em. I go into every job opportunity positive, willing to work, eager to learn and impress my higher ups. But naturally you talk to current employees and find out what sucks about the position, what's good about it. If the pay is good and the work isn't something soul crushingly boring like factory work? I've no issue sticking it out. But employers need to also understand. My job is tied to whoever provides a positive work experience/setting and a good pay rate.

Want loyalty? Buy a dog.

That being said, anytime I've left a job? It's blind-sided my boss. I don't let my employers, employees, or co-workers know I'm jaded the way I am. They get that on the way out. My generation treats jobs as a business exchange. Many of us aren't here to, ""earn respect"". I provide a service. You pay me. That's it. I'll play nice with the other kids and do what's expected of me. If I befriend someone? Help them out along the way when I can.

Also your definition of ""good work ethic"" is subjective. Ask 5 different people, probably get 5 different answers. I can toot my horn and say all I want that I'm a good worker, I exceed expectations, I go out of my way and turn businesses around but let's be real. This is the internet and unless proof is provided? Who cares? We can dick measure all we want but that'll get us no-where. 

And regardless what you say, discussing wages is good for the workers. My previous job I openly discussed it and we found 2 employees who held the same elevated position as myself were making quite a bit less than me. We all did the same work. They'd been there longer than me. So why the gap? Why WOULDN'T I tell them they're being taken advantage of? Do I deserve more simply cause I asked for it? Bullshit.

If you pay your employees enough to make a living wage? I commend you. Good for you and your employees. But your opinions on the work force and how employees should be treated is obviously VERY dated. Wages have stagnated. Money is 100% a motivator. But so is working conditions. Having a leader, not a boss. People who you work with that don't sit in their car 10 minutes before their shift wishing the place would catch fire so they don't have to go in. People literally WISHING their covid test comes back POSITIVE just in hopes of getting some time off.

All in all I'm still out here. Still looking for better work. Still trying to stay positive.Currently employed with a local business but there's no room for advancement. He pays above minimum but it's still not a livable wage. Recently had an interview with ""Food City"" that's opening in Cookeville. Glassdoor reports from current and former employees listed the position I was applying for as much higher paying. Went and did the entire interview process....they offered me a measly $10 per hour. Declined the position and walked away laughing.

"Damn that was well written. I’m glad you got that out because the owners talk about you in the same light but more negative way. I get it. The problem is there are good employers and you are so jaded that you make them jaded. What a circle.

Also, I’m talkng the entire high school educated population, not high school age. 

As far as overtime, you will never own your own business and that’s why I am successful. I would not hire you just because of that attitude either, no offense, sorry.

That 40 hours straight deal was a power plant that was out of operation and I turned my job around in 40 hours after my boss left in 10. I took the next day off and was called in the office as why I took the day off. (Sleep) Long story short the plant manger paid me the extra day. I made some serious coin at a young age and garnered respect. Sadly that money wasn’t enough. I moved on to greener pastures.

I didn’t mean you had to work those kind of hours all the time. That’s your problem if you never try and don’t have good work habits you won’t be paid well. Those hours put in come with rewards. I don’t work for free nor do I except others too.
I was ALWAYS under paid. Yet enjoyed being well paid in my working class. It wasn’t until I was forced to employ others and my talents to forge my own way did I make a decent living. On the journey I’m sure I felt like you at times but man I learned a lot for future use 😉.
The firing thing is stupid but very true. I only once slipped out what I was making, the reaction of my coworker wasn’t good. I never did it again. I always in every job got to command top shitty wage. Know your talents. 
I use to tell my apprentices when their down, open your wallet and tell them it’s time to fill it. 
I tried to train local apprentices. One made $2500 take home in one week 4 years ago. He quit the very next week, too mich work. 
Anybody employed by me gets a living wage and healthcare. I’m lucky enough to figured out how to do that. I have had some troubles with my employees. My accountant told me I paid too well not to be able to get the talent I wanted. I hate firing people but I did get what I wanted. It took a while.🤦‍♂️ Money is not a motovator like you think it is. I won’t deny it helps though. A living wage is easily found by looking up what poverty is and paying at least more than that. After that it’s talent and fuck you if you don’t like what I pay someone else. Do the work! You would 💩your pants if I told you what I pay my contractors with my skill set 🤣. 

Most of the factories here are exactly as you describe. I hate working in them especially with unmotivated workers. I don’t need a babysitter. I need a thinking talented robot babysitter called an operator, not a compliant drone. Doesn’t matter where I go in the states the story is mostly the same. The south is definitely worse.

So there is two sides to the coin. I absolutely agree with your assessment but if you let that drag you down you won’t be able to pick yourself up. I am just letting you know it is possible without screwing people along the way.

I also encourage everyone to take advantage of the current labor situation and moves yourself up. If you are ever going to do it now is the time.

"That's something I noticed about the ""older crowd"". Not just here in the South, but all over. Working 40 hours straight? Working 120 hour weeks? That's not impressive. That's not something to boast about. *It's sad.*

And as someone who's been in both supervisory and management positions before? I understand what you're saying about High-School age kids being your employees. I'm not disputing that many are lazy, many will sit on their phone and not do a thing until told to. Then act annoyed that they actually have to do work. But as an employer who's stated that you, ""Pay well above the low wage rate here"" you also need to understand..... with minimum wage being $7.25? Let's say you pay $10 an hour of which many places are offering and is definitely above minimum....**It's still not a livable wage.** Not unless we're working 50+ hour weeks. And at that point? That's just a miserable existence. Call my generation entitled, or self centered or what-have-you. But we've come to realize there's more to life than just work, work work. Specially when the end result is a shitty little apartment with rising prices, and not much else to call your own.

Furthermore we got companies down here forbidding employees from discussing wages amongst one another. Saying it's grounds for being fired. (*Which is 100% illegal*). Not discussing wages only benefits the employer. As you said, too many motivated people not being rewarded for their efforts and simply being abused by the system. All that being said, if the pay isn't worth it? I don't blame anyone, regardless of age, from not being enthusiastic and having an unwillingness to learn. Why bother getting devoted and learning the ins and outs of the job if you're already looking for a replacement that'll pay you fairly and decently so that you can just survive? There's no pensions anymore. Many of us realize we'll be working till we're dead. Might as well be at a place you can tolerate that pays well. 

&#x200B;

I've moved here to TN years ago and I too have taken one one shitty job after the other.  But seeing how employers are acting? How they're treating their employees, how little they're paying them, how much time they're expected to spend at work? I don't blame the working force for ***one second*** for participating in the, ""Great Resignation"". There is no worker shortage. What there **IS** a shortage of, is jobs willing to treat their employees like human-fucking-beings and paying them fairly. Those are the jobs are being passed up on and ignored.

I worked 40 hours straight on one occasion, as much as 120 hours in a week. Hint no employer wants someone who won’t work overtime.  No one should work overtime work for free. The 120 hours? I was on triple time. SWEAT!

As an employer who employees local people, you need a serious understand of Cookeville average high school educated worker. They can be Lazy, no work ethics, very few skills, and some are unwilling to learn, they have no issue spending my time on their cell phone. Money doesn’t motivate either. I find transplants much better in all those areas.  
I want to be part of the community and help the young ones but they seem to not want to earn it. I pay well above the low wage rate here with fully paid healthcare. The young ones could care less. As I visit factories across the state I see more of the same. On the flip side I do see some motivated people who are not rewarded for their efforts. I see them as being abused  by semi-communist system that the owners think it is ok to pay everyone the same to keep harmony among the troops. Then I completely understand this uncompetitive culture 🤷‍♂️
Now don’t get me wrong there are fine people but hard to find. Their daddy had a work ethic and transfer it to them. The rest will tell you to your face they don’t get paid enough to learn. The worse was the first auto part plant I worked for that management told Ford and I, they don’t pay their operators enough to train them. They shortly  fired me after I told them what I thought.🖕Ford was even more unpleasant. Mandatory 12 hours days 7 days per week, 2 days off per month. Lol so hard what I told HR.🖕
 
God bless the rest is history.
Start your our business and do as you say👍 Grow a pair 💯
I think plenty of young people are giving it a go. Then you can hire people and see what reality is.🍺

Or you can continue to enjoy looking for that perfect job to start your career.

The Herald Citizen sucks. This will be my last year subscribing. Posting a big fat paywall is useless. The local news talk radio is giving them a good run and their reportng is more accurate less biased.
I thought it was a disgraceful attack on the Cookeville mayor last year because he has two jobs and gets paid well. Do not know the guy but the stuff the paper post was such BS. They had his pay scale and were afraid to post it because the hospital management threaten them. So they cause a big stir then were too afraid or poor to affirm their rights. Well then don’t get into the fray.
We live in area where there is a large discrepancy between the haves and have nots. I feel they were trying to tear that wound open at the mayor’s political expense. If their issue was divesting the Mayor from  the hospital the city owns they did a very bad job of it. They are pussies extolling their rights then backing off with a whimper. 

Im tired of them littering the entire neighborhood with their yellow bagged free newspaper. Why should I have clear up their junk? It’s not like I didn’t ask them to stop either. Im sure our storm drains are filled with them. Use the damn postal system better yet sink into a hole of oblivion and go out of business. Seems you are just about there. 

Their reporters are as lazy as can be and do written reports on meetings they never attend while their competition has two people present. They contact people after the fact and report opinions as fact. I have seen this behavior more than once.

They totally misreported the Algood Drug store robbery 2 years ago and could of cared less. 

The last kick is they play around with the editorials. Which in reality all I read with the local news. Why should I ever trust this media?  I fall just a little short of calling them scumbags like Trump would but incompetent is fairly accurate.

Sorry if I am off subject but this has been bothering me for a while.

Unfortunately news radio doesn’t have the scoop.

"Considering all that goes into running a commercial airport, it's just not going to happen yet. Maybe in a couple decades, but that is assuming that commercial flight industry hasn't completely gone bust (or more likely just stops growing).

For context, Maryville (the Knoxville region's airport) has about 300k population within 20 minutes of the airport and runs maybe a dozen, 16 max, gates. They cannot fly anything bigger than a 4 row plane. Tickets are significantly more expensive than flying out of Knoxville, prohibitively so.

Sparta has a population of, optimistically, 70k people within 20 minutes. This region has 20% less avg household income than the comparable Knoxville area. Maybe it could be a driver of economic growth and this is a call to those parties interested, but I personally just don't think it makes sense.

"This wasn't a run of the mill 40% increase. As I stated early, the property in question was the first of fourteen units to be completed in a townhouse complex. The rent was low because it had to be to entice someone who was going to be willing to move into an active construction zone for months on end. So a portion of the increase was related to the discount of an active construction zone going away, another portion was due to the rising costs of the construction during the period, and a last portion was due to the overall competitiveness of the local market.

The same cheap money that is benefiting investors (aka: the rich) is the same money that is letting lower income folks borrow money at the lowest rates in history.

The vast majority of federal reserve bond purchases (meaning 96%+) were just plain old treasuries. The corporate bonds they bought were largely short term and short lived and relatively insignificant to the overall problem you are describing. Moreover, again, these actions are what drove down rates for everyone not just the rich.

You reference Shake Shack, I am not particularly familiar with that exact scenario but I would imagine it is a franchisee applying for PPP loans for employees. I wouldn't call that abuse. Should the owner of the Chik-Fil-A on Interstate Dr be prohibited from accessing PPP loans? Should the owner of the two McDonald's in town? These aren't owned by a large corporation, they are owned and operated by a local business owner. Moreover, this wasn't a gift to the business owners it was a necessity of the federal and state governments. The governments at the time were desperate to keep people on private payrolls because the unemployment system was overwhelmed. So either the government can give the employers money under the guarantee they would remain employed or the government can give them money through the UE system. Same net result.

To be clear, I agree this is largely a problem of fiscal and political party policy. The federal government in this country has embarked on rampant spending and printing of money to support it which is creating inflation that was contained until now. It has also created a monstrous asset bubble that is going to explode. 

The article you cited, which I didn't read the whole thing, isn't particularly new. In 2008/09 there were a number of private investments that allowed you to do this sort of thing. There were also a ton of families that did the same thing. 

In the end, I am not sure what you think the solution is. Circling back to the subject of the article you have someone who was paying an artificially low rent getting double tapped by losing the ""active construction"" discount and a rising rental market rate at the same time. The idea that she was going to live in a zero maintenance 3 bedroom, brand new townhome, for $1200/mo just isn't in the cards. By the looks of it that property cost around $240k per unit to build, excluding land costs. Taxes on it are probably 3k/yr all in and then you have the property and building maintenance. So it is probably a 5k/yr maintenance/tax cost and then the mortgage. The landlord isn't getting rich here.",t2_9gqllxbo,bave165,0,1643647730.0,0,t1_hv0gq2i,hv0gq2i,False,johnny4velma,t3_sesny3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookeville/comments/sesny3/tenant_sees_41_increase_in_rent/,Tenant sees 41% increase in rent,/r/cookeville/comments/sesny3/tenant_sees_41_increase_in_rent/hv0gq2i/,1,r/cookeville,0,1

I'm not saying a small developer in Cookeville is part of a global conspiracy but that a 40% increase in rent between leases is not just supply and demand and ""simply how the market works"". It is the predictable outcome of bad federal financial policy that is designed to benefit the rich.

The federal government through executive administration, congress, and the Reserve has distributed around $10 trillion in COVID relief funds. Of that, $4 trillion was federal reserve asset purchases, which included unprecedented actions such as buying up corporate debt bonds. None of that $4 trillion did any good for the average American and has done nothing but inflate the dollar and the stock market. A major crash is inevitable to anyone living in reality. Of the other $~6 trillion, it's hard to say where it all went but when the stimulus was fresh there were stories abound concerning corporations like Shake Shack abusing payroll loan programs, etc. The whole thing has been disaster capitalism at its finest tag teaming with a corporate-sponsored government. 

I'm saying all the massive rent increases and general inflation we are seeing is a direct result poor fiscal policy and not, as was stated, ""quite simply how the market works"".

"so its a supply/demand thing? meaning rent is what it is because theres a lot of people vying for a limited resource, so the owners of that resource can jack up the price? a resource, by the way, that people *need*. so the owners have the customers captive: what are they gonna do, *not* have a home? demand for this product is high because its essential to dignity and thriving. making the price unnecessarily high for the sake of maximizing profit is immoral. hell, charging for housing at all is extortion. if im dying of thirst in the desert, the person who could give me a bottle of water  but doesnt because i only have $5 on me and they want $10 is an immoral asshole. doubly so when they paid $4 for the bottle themselves and have crates of the stuff in their car.

its not these people in particular. they are screwed, but there are options. they have an income and can get another place (paycheck to paycheck sucks, though, and how they'll come up with first and last months rent plus security deposit for a place in one month i dont know off the top of my head), but the landlord hiked the rent $500 on them. there's no way the unit became $6000 more expensive to maintain per year. and the same principle is just how owning rental property works: you have to pay me, so i can charge what i like. i lived for a year in a studio apartment in cookeville for $550. it was a dank, unheated, unfurnished basement room with no oven and an airplane bathroom size sink. i woke up with centipedes crawling on me multiple times. mushrooms grew out of the wall. it was awful and way over priced and i hated existing in that space. but i needed a place to stay, and this was the cheapest i could find, so i paid. what was i supposed to do? what *could* i do? its not enough to say i got out of that situation. i got lucky. lots of people dont, and they get stuck, or worse, lose even that. and it all comes down to the choice of the landlord to maximize profit. they dont have to do that. it doesnt have to be that way.",t2_cxz6is2r,elle_sum,0,1643433663.0,0,t1_huoospy,huoospy,False,johnny4velma,t3_sesny3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookeville/comments/sesny3/tenant_sees_41_increase_in_rent/,Tenant sees 41% increase in rent,/r/cookeville/comments/sesny3/tenant_sees_41_increase_in_rent/huoospy/,1,r/cookeville,0,1

Not a roommate situation, so the <1k/m was for the whole place if that’s what you meant. 

Agree that $1700/mo seems like too much. 

As for why rent is high, cookeville is (source: https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/cookeville-tn-population) growing at almost 2% per year. And (source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookeville,_Tennessee) we are among the fastest growing non-metropolitan cities in the whole country.

"were you sharing rent? what percentage of your monthly wage went to rent? did covid have an effect on the cost of rent?

i 100% agree with you that buying is a better deal and should be done. id like to point out, though, that 5% of $100k is $5k, which isnt an easy amount to get ahold of when you're living paycheck to paycheck. at $15/hr, you gross $2400/month. after taxes, that's what, $2k? $1800? $1700 (their new rent) split two ways is $850. Car payment is, say, $150. Car insurance is $100. Health insurance worth anything is at least $250. Gasoline is, what, $100? Food for a month is... $200? throw $100 in for utilities. so expenses, just to live, is $1750. so if you budget PERFECTLY, and have ZERO unplanned expenses, and NEVER actually GO to the doctor or pay for medication, and don't have a cell phone or internet access, you can put away between $50 and $250 a month. so the $5k will take between 20 and 100 months to save up. living like that for just under two years? alright, maybe that's doable. eight years? literally impossible. at some point your car will need tires, or you'll need blood pressure meds, or maybe one year you want to buy your family Christmas or birthday presents (which, you'll notice, i didn't budget for), and your savings for an entire year are eliminated. so now its nine years. three years later, something else happens that you couldn't predict. 

fuck, maybe nothing happens at all, but the price of a home goes up, and now instead of $5k you need $7k. thats another three and a half years, so twelve and a half years total. maybe health insurance gets $25 more expensive a month. thats HALF what you're putting away per month, so now its TWENTY FIVE years. all to put 5% down on a house that was built during the eisenhower administration.

thats a worst case scenario, but its ALSO based on $15/hr. the minimum wage in TN is $7.25/hr. most jobs nowadays seem to be paying $11-12/hr. $15/hr is considered GOOD MONEY. something is wrong here.

rant aside, here's the million dollar question: WHY is the rent so high? i bet its not a matter of necessity. i bet the profit margin on these units isnt as thin as the landlords would like us to believe.

edit: im doing more math to be more charitable and realistic. hold on.

edit2:
alright, different math.
assumed expenses i altered a bit, but not much. i threw in what i could from my own life (phone, insurance, etc). im using $1k as rent, split two ways, making $500. tax burden in tn i found to be 18%, so im using that.

expenses:

rent-$500

car payment-$246 (mine, i feel like its a bad deal, but im locked in)

car insurance-$120

health ins-$100 (without the ACA tax credit this would be $600)

gas-$100 (i actually drive for a living, so i spend this much in a week, so im kinda guessing)

utilities:$125 (average electric bill in TN is ~$125 according to a very quick google)

phone-$60 (this is mine: its a shitty service, but its an unlimited data plan. i figure that can he used as an internet connection, so im not including an internet bill in these calculations)

total expenses: $1451/month

(remember, this is just to tread water. no eating out, no hulu, no medication or doctors or auto repair, no Christmas presents, no clothes from goodwill)

at $15/hr, you take home $1968/month, leaving $542 to save. itd take ten months to save up a $5k down payment. that's a lot better. still, its a wobbly road. what if i get in an accident? chip a tooth? need a new car battery? not the end of the world, but still significant.

at $12/hr, you take home $1574/month, leaving $148 to save. that's 34 months of austerity to save $5k, just under three years. getting a lot tighter. i dont know about you, but it seems unreasonable to expect someone to be able to avoid huge expenses like doctors or buying socks for three years.

for fun, let's do $7.25/hr. That's $951 net a month. You are $475 short. You have to cut $475 from somewhere. Rent is nonnegotiable. Food is nonnegotiable. So let's cut out a car. That saves you $460, between a car payment and insurance and gas. And heck, let's get a limited data plan at $30 a month. Ok! So you're walking everywhere and you can't use the internet without a public wifi network (does starbucks let you sit there without buying anything?), but you can put away a whopping $15/month!

"I can't help but wonder...

If landlords were forced to publicly display where all the money goes and how much is pocketed personally...would things change? Cookeville is a college town. There's no doubt about that. Aside from them we got lots of retiree's in the area. People with money. 

Having worked at local bars and venues here in Cookeville and talking to countless college students and young adults? There's a number of them whose family pays for most amenities (Car, car insurance, rent, phone bill) It's the people whose families are not paying for such things that all seem to not be able to make a profit to live even somewhat comfortably. In other words, average people just trying to survive, and college kids without a fortunate family. 

And I feel for both sides. I do. 
Materials, repairs, services and taxes being the way they are. I'm sure landlords have their own expenses to deal with.

"Seven years ago, Tennessee Tech sociology graduate Cassidy Richard lived in a two-bedroom, one-bath house on Walnut Avenue for $600 a month, a cost she split with a roommate.

After managing a restaurant and working at a call center, Richard saved her money to move to Oregon until the pandemic prompted the closure of the mechanic shop, where she worked at the front desk, and she ultimately decided to move back to Cookeville.

Last year, Richard and her boyfriend signed a lease with Brighton Park Place on 10th Street for $1,200 a month, but this month, they received an email that the rent would increase to $1,700 a month.

""I can't afford to live,"" said Richard, who makes $15 an hour working at an accounting firm. ""I can barely afford to survive. I'm emotionally exhausted, physically pained, and mentally marred by the level of greed and absolute disregard for other humans being flaunted by such unscrupulous persons.""

Richard said the landlord wouldn't respond to return emails asking why the rent is going up so much.

In response to an email from the Herald-Citizen, Shawna Cullom of Capital Communities said, ""As you know, pricing has increased with everything — from food, fuel, housing, property taxes, etc. These new units were rented out way under the market price. Everyone was aware that rent would increase after year 1, but due to the unforeseen circumstances this past year, the price had to increase more than we had anticipated and wanted for any of our tenants.

""It takes 2 months rent from these rentals to even pay the property taxes that have increased this year. Not including price increases of lawn maintenance, repairs, labor, material, etc.,"" Cullom said.

After considering the cost of moving to a new apartment, Richard said they'd planned to stay even though that meant working an extra 17 hours a month to make up the increase and giving up other things such as dining out and subscriptions to Amazon Prime and Hulu.

""Our reason for renting vs. buying is simple: we can't afford to buy,"" Richard said. ""We'd want to be responsible and put down 20%, and houses in this area are now $200K and up which means putting down around $40K. This isn't the 1980s, I can't afford a 3-bedroom house on a cake decorator and garbage worker salaries like my parents could. I'm an experienced bookkeeper living with a retail store manager, and we can't afford a house in this town.""

Richard's complaints about the price increase has led to another problem. 

""We understand that tenants may disagree as to the value of rental property,"" Cullom said in an email to Richard and her boyfriend. ""That is why we provide ample notice of price increases and non-renewals. Since you have unquestionably noted that you are opposed to a price increase, we are retracting the notice of increase and instead providing you with a notice of non-renewal instead. There is a little over a month until the end of your term, and hopefully this will allow you the opportunity to seek a place that more closely suits your budgetary needs.""

Richard said, ""We now have one month to come up with a security deposit, first month's rent and last month's rent in order to be eligible to rent a new place to live. And of course, we won't be receiving our deposit back from North Point until after March 1. I don't have a litigious bone in my body, but this certainly feels like retaliation."" 

Cookeville City Manager James Mills said the city has received numerous complaints about housing and rental costs for the past several years.

""I’m afraid we are headed to a housing crisis if rental rates continue like what you mentioned,"" he said. ""I don’t understand the justification for such an increase for existing dwellings.""

Luke Eldridge, the housing program manager at UCHRA's Substance Abuse Solutions, said that the city doesn't have ""the housing market we need.""

Eldridge said he's also seen some people being evicted because of how much they owe their landlords.

""A lot of people we try to help can't afford a three-bedroom, two-bath apartment for $1,700 a month,"" he said. ""We don't have that middle-income-based housing.""

Marla Williams, managing attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands, said that landlords may not raise the rent during the term of the lease, unless it is a month-to-month rental.

"Great question. I was born and have lived here most my life. Except for a brief hiatus out west. In Phoenix there was lots to do . However when I moved back here in my thirties at the time we also tried looking for things to do. Since neither my wife or I liked the bar scene basically we just raised our kids. However there’s a lot of “mudding ” around here and while flying through the trees on or in an off-road vehicle is alot like star wars it can get tiresome after the first 2 years. Also unless you know someone or have alot of land that’s going to be a trip to East Tennessee. Riding street bikes is alot of fun be sure to watch for deer and invest in a rain suit. I spent my late 40’s in an alcohol induced coma and it was pretty entertaining as long as the bug zapper was plugged in. That little hobby made me gain about 100lbs. Nowadays I know longer drink. Can’t ride anymore as my old injuries from playing Star Wars haunts me badly with all the arthritis. I did loose all my extra pounds thanks to all my surgeries from an esophageal thing. Probably caused due to watching the grass grow then burning it back down!! Wink wink. Nowadays though,  I mostly build hot looking cars for my children to envy and hope I’ll pass them down. Since they were our entire reason for leaving the big city crime and mayhem. It’s just not ever going to happen.  especialy for the ones who moved to big cities themselves and left us here with a 4 acre lawn. Well at least I now own one of “the world’s fastest lawn mowers” thank goodness, because that fleet of cub cadets I had took twice as long!!

"The best thing about Cookeville, in my opinion, is the theatre scene. It’s pretty unique for a city so small. Cookeville Performing Arts Center produces quality plays several times a year. The local public schools really take their productions seriously and spare no expense. The Historic Cumberland County Playhouse is a short drive to the east, where theatre artists live and work and create countless opportunities to see excellent live performances. But—and again this is just my opinion—the crown jewel of live theatre here is the Backdoor Playhouse, on the campus of Tennessee Tech. They produce three or four productions per year, often thought provoking and controversial fare, and excellent musicals.

Tennessee Tech often hosts honored guests to speak, and invites the public. We’ve been graced with lectures and presentations by Maya Angelou, Dick Gregory, Margret Atwood, Marjane Satrapi, Eve Ensler and many others. Several authors and poets are scheduled to visit this year.

There’s also Open Mic Nights, Trivia Nights, great local bands, regular improv shows from Storyteller Theatre Co., a symphony orchestra, excellent visual artists and sculptors, and galleries that regularly feature their work.

I more than “lean left” and I find the politics here to be stifling and alienating. In summer 2020 we had a large BLM rally on the square, that prompted the local Klan members to harass demonstrators. Around the same time, local government started a terrorism campaign against our not-insignificant unhoused community. Our mayor is a self-dealing crook and our Sheriff runs a disgusting debtors jailhouse, where inmate occasionally die under mysterious circumstances. The police swallow most of our municipal budget, and they use it to terrorize the working class. Progressive professors and campus workers have had their jobs threatened for their activism. But, there’s also a large community of progressive groups that work together to make life here less miserable and reactionary. 

Also, lots of great local bars and restaurants, with wonderful food and even better staff.",t2_6bb1ibi3,DexterRavenwood,0,1642278698.0,0,t1_hst6awf,hst6awf,True,floodthesun,t3_s4ndwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookeville/comments/s4ndwu/may_be_moving_to_the_area/,May be moving to the area!,/r/cookeville/comments/s4ndwu/may_be_moving_to_the_area/hst6awf/,3,r/cookeville,0,3
"I'm a progressive, non-religious 26 year old, I'm from Cookeville but moved away for five years, I just moved back short term to work on a project. I used to want to get out of Cookeville so bad, but now I've grown some appreciation of the town. I'm excited when my friends not from the area visit so I can show them around. Cookeville has grown so much in the past 7-8 years, it's kind of crazy.

There is a good community of like-minded individuals, but you'll have to seek them out. You won't be ostracized for not being religious or a Republican, but you will be in the minority. I definitely feel like these folks gravitate towards Cookeville community theatre group and those involved in the art events. 

The arts community is truly thriving, the Appalachian Center for Craft, a satellite campus of Tennessee Tech, is twenty minutes away and that draws many students artists who end up staying and setting up studios. The Art Prowl is a yearly studio tour event in the fall, and Art Round Tennessee is an active arts community year-round. You can take workshops and see shows at the Craft Center and at Tech's Bryan Fine Arts building. You can also buy local made goods (and some non-local) and art at The Silver Fern, they also have small gallery openings and it's a loose tea room. The ladies that own it are the best!  

It's true that the music scene is probably less than a dozen local bands that rotate playing shows at restaurants and breweries, but if you find a couple you like you can plug into the community quickly by seeking out their shows. 

There's ton of hiking and fishing nearby, much more than towns closer to Nashville. All of the states best waterfalls are within 45 minutes of Cookeville due to it's geographic location on the edge of the Cumberland plateau. 

The Walnut Street Market is a fresh market of all local grown and made goods. You can also plug into CSA subscriptions (community supported agriculture) there. 

If there's one thing I can say about Cookeville, it's that all people, regardless of ideology, truly love supporting local business, there's a huge culture of pride in the local restaurant, coffee, boutiques, music, and art scene.",t2_uob9c,lifebyabby,0,1642278003.0,0,t1_hst4kmz,hst4kmz,True,floodthesun,t3_s4ndwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookeville/comments/s4ndwu/may_be_moving_to_the_area/,May be moving to the area!,/r/cookeville/comments/s4ndwu/may_be_moving_to_the_area/hst4kmz/,6,r/cookeville,0,6

"If you enjoy plays, there are many options.  Cumberland Country Playhouse is 30 minutes away in Crossville performing high production value plays.  Cookeville Performing Arts Center (CPAC) has several good productions each year.  Cookeville High School has one very high quality play each spring.  Of course, TPAC is in Nashville. 

There are a few regular public events that you may enjoy such as Fall Fun Fest (food & live music), free outdoor concerts in Dogwood Park, and several events around July 4th including the 2nd largest fireworks show in the state.  Art Prowl is an annual event hosted by around 20 local art studios.

If you enjoy dining out, we have many fantastic restaurants in town.  We have several great local (not national chain) restaurants.  Our favorite is Foglight Foodhouse located in Walling which is a 40 minute drive. 

As far as the politics, my wife and I are center-right and many of our best friends are non-religious lefties.  The church we attend has a mix as well.  As long as you don't have a chip on your shoulder, it's not an issue.

"lived there. moved out 3 years ago. The answers to your questions are -  

Bars, church or outdoor activities. The whole area is beautiful and plenty of nature experiences are available. There isnt much else for people to ""do"".  

Not being religious isnt really a problem per se, but it will reduce the scope of things to do. Its more of a problem if you lean politically liberal. But no one is gonna beat you for it.  

The music scene is the same 4-6 local bands that book gigs at Spankies, Vinnie T's and other bars. Concerts are in Nashville.  

The ""heart"" of town is the Square and the West Side where several different bars exist. Most everyone just lives outside of this area and drives to whatever they want to do. Algood is a nice place.  

Cookeville is a beautiful town with a lot of super nice people and i miss it, but its economy is crap. All the businesses compete to offer the lowest wages possible and gaslight employees into thinking that they are being done some huge favor with their paycheck.

"People are ok, lots of rednecks and white supremacists.

Nightlife sucks mostly non-existent... Unless you love line dancing and sports bars.

Culture is very religious and redneck people sort of pretending they live in a city while being ultra rural.

Cookeville police are pretty horrible and regularly abuse/arrest people for little/nothing, jail is a shitshow, they encourage inmates to assault each other to try to get them extra charges. They also have a hardon for busting homeless people for panhandling. City officials are totally ok with that. Out of town attorneys have referred to the city as a plantation that they're afraid to stay in overnight because of the unsolved murder rates.

Job market is that there are a lot of low paying subsidized factories that were built with tax dollars staffed by temp agencies. They are mostly felony friendly so they can get people at lower wages.

You can get as much work as you want at low pay.

Safety is regularly laughed at, look at recent photos of factories being opened with no one including staff or public officials wearing any PPE, schools allow kids to be bullied for wearing PPE.

As per transitional housing, there is a homeless shelter that occasionally does baptisms in a horse troft in their parking lot you can see when driving by.",t2_7jdtb,omnicidial,0,1641304866.0,0,t1_hr7p5rb,hr7p5rb,True,JustDynamite,t3_rvoa1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookeville/comments/rvoa1f/relocating_to_cookeville_to_restart_life_while/,Relocating to Cookeville to restart life while homeless.

"Where do you think it’s at? I see the word used very loosely so explain what you think it means. Even the old communist aren’t communist.
Concepts like national healthcare I heard as “communist “. It isn’t. Other democratic free countries look down on us for not havng this simple right.
So please explain. I think the word like Nazi, Hitler, and other over used words no longer have meaning.
Would you people consider that a political ad? Also was it clearly on a Roland media board? Doesn’t the other side get to put up an equal time ad? Seems over the top to me. Did we just go through a President kissing Putins ass on TV? Cant be fake news I saw it. Or our the Russian no longer communist? They aren’t kicking out ass is real product production and growth.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"I'm glad you asked about this. The short answer is ""yes"". For the longer answer, I can offer a few anecdotes:

Back in the '70s, I heard talk among the good-ol-boys about the mafia coming into the area. The odd thing about such talk was the \*tone\* of it - whispered and conspiratorial, of course, but also respectful. It seemed that the local culture was aligned with and accepting of the skullduggery and violence of the mafia. They were regarded as ""one of us"", it seemed.

Later, I had a run-in with puffed-up little Italian punk who threatened me in an interesting way. He said his daddy had connections and would make sure I never had a job in Cookeville again. That didn't quite happen, but after that I did meet a couple of creeps who tried to intimidate me and let me know that they knew who I was by calling me by name, though we had never met. It took a while to figure out what these creeps all had in common.

One last anecdote: Apparently, the DOJ uses Fairfield Glade near Crossville for settling mobsters who are in the witness protection program. A friend of mine met one who was living there some years ago. The bastard was quite comfortable and complacent in his new life and openly bragged to my friend about the crimes he committed and got away with.",t2_ft0tejl4,Herodotus_Ajax,0,1638493037.0,0,t1_hn09lsg,hn09lsg,True,johnson50000,t3_qw3yqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookeville/comments/qw3yqq/who_knows_the_cookeville_mafia/,Who knows the cookeville mafia?,/r/cookeville/comments/qw3yqq/who_knows_the_cookeville_mafia/hn09lsg/,3,r/cookeville,0,3

"Amazon is snapping up disused shopping malls and turning them into fulfillment centers.

Between 2016 and 2019, Amazon converted around 25 shopping malls, according to an analysis by Coresight Research. Last year, it was reportedly in talks with Simon Property Group, the country's biggest mall owner, to convert bankrupt JCPenney and Sears department stores into fulfillment centers.

"New Nashville Amazon Location Could Benefit Upper Cumberland    
by: Logan Weaver, NewsTalk 94.1    
    
A new Amazon operations site in Nashville could bring more people and business to the Upper Cumberland.    
    
Cookeville Mayor Ricky Shelton says the announcement impacts more than just the Nashville metropolitan area. “It’s exciting for our region and the city and county as well because there will be opportunities for folks who live here to work there,” Shelton says, “and I’m sure there will be people moving to Tennessee due to the new Amazon center so it’s an opportunity if they want to live in a smaller town, and we’d be a perfect location for that.”    
    
Amazon announced Tuesday it would invest nearly $230 million for a new logistics facility employing roughly 5,000 corporate and tech-related jobs.    
    
Shelton says having the likes of Tennessee Tech and other technological programs in the region will allow more graduates to stay in the area with the addition of Amazon. “They’re a great asset as evident by SAIC locating here about two years ago now and of course the new jobs at ATC, both being high-tech jobs,” Shelton says. “They all said that Tennessee Tech was a big driver for that. The future is very bright for Cookeville, Putnam County, and our region.”",t2_3p417,chucksutherland,0,1638283091.0,0,t1_hmnzyvy,hmnzyvy,False,screeching_josh,t3_r5e40l,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookeville/comments/r5e40l/amazon/,Amazon.,/r/cookeville/comments/r5e40l/amazon/hmnzyvy/,4,r/cookeville,0,4

"Mafia is a certain type of organized crime that I'm not sure that we have here now. There may be other forms of organized crime in the area, but are low profile enough for them to fly under the radar of the average citizen.

However, in the history of the region, we were loved and well occupied with the mafia as a result of Prohibition. Lots of locals were willing to assist in the production and distribution of alcohol during that time, and there were numerous speakeasies. [Talley Creek Cave](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chucksutherland/46421103244) was the basement for a speakeasy during this time.

There is a story, which I cannot convey with much accuracy off the top of my head, where THE FREAKING JAMESTOWN COURTHOUSE WAS DESTROYED by the mafia. If I remember the details, they dynamited it either to send a message to the sheriff, or to spring inmates, or both.

"The whereabouts of a 15-year-old remain unknown after he disappeared from his Loudon residence more than two weeks ago.  
  
Tegan Daugherty was last seen at 9 a.m. Oct. 10 at his home.  
  
Authorities believe Daugherty left on a black bicycle with neon green stripes on the tires. He was wearing blue jeans and a dark blue Jurassic Park T-shirt. Daugherty wears prescription eyeglasses and had them on when he disappeared.  
  
“According to the information that we have been able to determine, it is a runaway case,” James “Bear” Webb, Loudon police chief, said. “I mean he did run away from home at 9 o’clock on Sunday the 10th, and the parents reported that he had run away. But whenever you get to a point where we’re at now, I would consider him not just a runaway, but also missing because we don’t have any information to his whereabouts or don’t have any idea where he is. It’s hard to believe that he’s still in the local area.”  
  
Loudon Police Department started a three-day search Oct. 12 after locating the teenager’s backpack behind Loudon High School, Webb said. LPD sought help from Blount County Sheriff’s Office to conduct a drone search.  
  
“Also on that day, Loudon Fire Department and one of my off-duty police officers, they put their boats in the Tennessee River and went up and down the river searching the banks for his bicycle thinking that there was a possibility that somehow he might have got to the river and accidentally got in the river somehow, so we searched the banks of the river for his bicycle,” Webb said. “Anybody that gives us any kind of lead whatsoever we search theirs. We had over a dozen people actually physically walk the area where the backpack was found and searched the area and did, I wouldn’t say specifically a grid search ... but we did have over a dozen people walking and doing the best we could with the amount of people we had to search the area.  
  
“We made no contact with Tegan Daugherty or the bicycle or any other article that might belong to him or turn up any other piece of evidence,” he added.  
  
Since Oct. 15, LPD Detective Brian Jenkins said the department has taken a team approach, getting area agencies more involved and seeking help from Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.  
  
“We had all exhausted all of the resources of the city at that point and we felt like that the scope of the search probably needed to get bigger probably than the city of Loudon at that point, obviously, and the TBI being a larger agency would have more resources and a larger reach to go out and help search for him,” Webb said.  
  
Jenkins said LPD is following every lead the department can.  
  
“We’ve had several where some have been legitimate, some not,” Jenkins said. “A lot of children from the high school have tried to be helpful but lot of that ended up just being rumors that they had heard from one kid or the other that ended up being completely false. That’s the most frustrating part is trying to filter through what’s legitimate information and what’s just rumor. We’re still pushing out flyers and trying to blanket this end of the county.

"Hello, 

Born and Raised Nashvillian here.  We just bought a house in Cookeville and kept hearing our agent say that Cali people were 'coming' to cookeville.  Have you met any Cali people or are there any Californias here?  My partner and I only met some pretty pretentious people at a coffee shop from Whitehouse area, very sweet owner of a gaming shop, and a sweetheart TTU wattress.  

&#x200B;

  Our first Real Estate Agent kept telling us about the influx of Cali buyers, but she had no idea about the ton of properties we had found with 7 + acres 15 mins from tech.  The only properties she showed us were complete tear down jobs, way over priced, with terrible land.  She repeated to us so many times that, ""Californias buying places unseen!! CASH!""  That was four months ago and only one of the homes has sold we looked at.  It just feels like a lie about a wave of california people.

"A person who sincerely believes that blacks are a lower form of human being, but who manages to suppress those feelings as they go about their lives, and engages in friendly and peaceful relations with all races and ethnicities, I have no issue with that person.

I once knew a guy on the Internet, very smart guy, also severely racist. He could go into great detail on his opinions on just what it was that made various nonwhite groups inferior. Like he'd go into the shapes of their skulls and everything. He was also a hardcore libertarian. His stance was that nonwhites were clearly inferior, but because that was completely out of their control, it would be nothing short of tyranny for the government to discriminate against them. He said slavery was ""a black mark on this country that a thousand years could never wash clean."" Interesting guy.

I think he emigrated to some Nordic country during the Obama years.

"""Oh so your just one of those hateful bigots. Why does a 15 year Olds immigration status matter? Why would you assume she was an illegal immigrant? Oh so you assume she's an illegal alien (a criminal) solely because of her race? That's literally racism.""

I feel like you are using the word ""you"" to refer to me, when you should be addressing the people I am hypothesizing the motivations of. I haven't ever refused service from a person based on their ethnicity or immigration status.

""Who supports police violence?! So police shooting unarmed teenagers in the back is good and you think they should do it more?""

Polls conducted after every one of these high profile police shootings show there is a sizeable number of Americans who always or almost always side with the officer in these situations. Not to mention, virtually every time it goes to a jury trial, the officer gets off, demonstrating a fairly common point of view that police violence is either not a problem or a necessary evil.

""They were simply protesting the idea that black lives matter, which mean they believed black lives mattered less. That's also racism plain and simple.""

""Black Lives Matter"" is a politicized phrase. While if you take it purely at face value it is unobjectionable to the overwhelming majority of Americans, when you add the context of how it is used by both supporters and detractors, it is impossible to simply assume that somebody who has a negative reaction to the phrase must necessarily devalue black lives.

""Oh and fuck the kkk. That's not inflammatory, if I said fuck Adolf Hitler and someone assaulted me I would say they were a nazi.""

To be fair, given your fondness of hyperbole, you would likely say they were a Nazi regardless of what they did, so long as they disagreed with you.

Perhaps they are concerned about the employee's immigration status or English speaking ability.

""Most of our prisoners are minorities even though most people in this town are white.""

Is this not the case nationwide? Statistically non whites are disproportionately more likely to commit crimes, due to numerous factors, including a national habit of criminalizing behaviors found mostly among non whites.

Good. Surely they have a right to support police violence if you have a right to oppose it?

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

1. Had Bright House internet CATV morphed into Charter comm. morphed into Spectrum on East coast Middle of Florida. Spectrum Internet was pretty good and reasonable. CATV also pretty good compared to say Comcast etc. Went with Spectrum Mobile since Sprint was collapsing morphed in T-Mobile. Now living in Middle Tennessee and Spectrum Mobile is very spotty as also is T-Mobil. Version seems to cover much of what I need but certainly far from perfect and expensive. Then there’s small comm. companies covering Middle Tennessee for Internet and CATV but offer no Mobile services. I will need to go with Ben Lomand Comm. as spectrum again is very sporadic coverages for Internet CATV and Mobile. Have been lots of complaints in the past six weeks about Spectrum especially internet. Your bars or may be decent but the signal is empty or the content drops out. I believe this may be due to equipment buildout and the headend equipment is also being upgrades.,t2_aphi0i5h,DeepSouth1226,0,1628028129.0,0,t1_h7lt8o3,h7lt8o3,True,ronfuckingswanson_,t3_ou82fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/cookeville/comments/ou82fm/internet/,Internet,/r/cookeville/comments/ou82fm/internet/h7lt8o3/,2,r/cookeville,0,2
