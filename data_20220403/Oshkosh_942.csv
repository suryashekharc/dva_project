Thank god for that. My current place is a Comcast soft-monopoly where I'm barely getting a quarter of what I'm paying for, which is A) slower than what's available in Oshkosh and B) more expensive than the same.

Havenwood Heights is a bit better for not a ton more per month(at least last time I looked). We lived in Wyldewood for 2 years when they were brand new. Offer a lot of great features but they are pretty expensive. Also, the walls/sound insulation isn't any better than most apartments.

For cafes I like both Planet Perk and Caramel Crisp Cafe, they’re right next to each other and Caramel Crisp has a lot more things, like homemade popcorn, cookies, and a gift shop and more. If you like museums there’s a history museum and an art museum closer to the college campus on Algoma Blvd, plus there’s the EAA museum which is all about military aviation.

The center of the city is more hardcore. I lived on Central and New York street for 9 years and it wasn't that bad until the end..... Constant weed smoke and every downstairs neighbor I ever had was a heavy user or sold weed but I was single and I could deal with it because the rent was cheap. Unfortunately the last downstairs neighbor I had was a meth and/or heroin dealer.... Or at least I assume. They were actually really nice people to me and I swear they sort of ran a pawn shop of drug dealing really but the types of people that came over I could not deal with since I became guardian for a child. I needed to move so I purchased a house on the Southside near west high. Anyway it all depends on what you want to deal with but for me the Southside west of the river is better but the Northside also has a lot of areas that are desirable and highly sought after. You just need to drive around and you can see which areas are better and which are not so good.

"Anything west of highway 41 is where most people desire to live.  Houses on that side go faster than anywhere else in the city.  It is also the one of the most expensive parts of the city since houses cost more.  With this in mind, this *tends* to mean crime is lower, schools are nicer, etc.

There are daycare providers around all over. The one that I’ve heard most about and what we used at one time was Davis Childcare.  They had almost an impeccable record with the state.  The rest not so much. Davis is also the most expensive (go figure).  When we left it was $270/week for the youngest age groups. Three years later I would imagine it is getting close to almost $300/week now.

The north side IMO is the avoid area.  This is mostly because when you *do* see violent crime it is on that side. Most of the incidents involving gun fire is from this area.

There are crime maps online you can Google that shows where most crime occurs and of what type. I also suggest that if you’re looking at a house that you look up the sex registry to see who is living around you.

">Are there parts of town to avoid? 

I don't know if there's really a part to *avoid*, as in sketchy/dangerous, but **you'll** probably want to avoid the campus area, which is mostly to the north/northeast of campus and west of Main Street. Particularly The section east of Jackson Street to the river. The quality of housing is poorer and you'll have more ruckus from people during the school year. 

I feel like there isn't a huge geographical divide between nicer areas and less nicer ones on the south/east sides of town. Go a few blocks in one direction and the quality of the neighborhood can change quite a bit. 


>What's the daycare provider situation like?

There's a pretty wide range of options, from the top tier (Davis) to... less so. As with most daycares, there probably going to be a bit of a wait-list. 

>What's the housing market like?

Diverse, I guess? If you're buying, prices are up (like they are pretty much everywhere) and anything that's been on the market for more than a few weeks is probably concerning. You'll probably want to look at renting somewhere and then connecting with a realtor so you can get the listings as soon as they go up (and are taken off once they've accepted an offer) and not delayed like on Zillow.

There's some pretty decent apartments on the northwest side of town, near Aurora Hospital by Westhaven.

"Its really only worth it to grade cards that could be expensive, and would likely get a decent to high grade. You can find their specifications online, so you should go through them and give conservative grades to each one, and find the price for an ungraded vs graded one to see if actual grading is worth the money

Someone below mentioned going to a game store, but they'll give you less money than its worth unless you take in store credit. So, especially for more expensive cards, I'd sell to individuals (FB marketplace or eBay are good) unless you go to Flying Phoneix games or Adventure Games (both on main street) and find something you would want. Maybe pick up a new hobby, or board games for the family?

"Many of these have value. Sadly because they weren't put in a more sturdy protective sleeve that value is likely lower than what it could be.

That 1st edition Machamp could be worth between $50 and $800 depending on it's condition, for instance. The 1st edition Jolteon could be up to $150 too.

"Personally.. I hate them. They're based somewhere in southern Wisconsin and the reason I hate them is because when we first started renting from someone, all we had to do was drop the money in a secured mailbox nextdoor and call it a day. No hassle, no fuss, no stupid app, nothing.

Then they tell us they're using this company called prosper and we can pay online. I thought it was neat until they somehow decided that we never paid rent one month and literally sent us an eviction notice the following week. Luckily we were friends with the maintenance guy and showed him that we sent the money over already that week using the chase app. He sent it to his boss and then they handled it. We have never been late on rent payments. Ever.

Then they wanted to say they were adding electric to our bill when we pay the WPS bill directly. We never gave them the information or our account number for WPS. they just added some charge and said we owed.

"Presto in Appleton is always looking for new people. Starting I believe is between 16-17 and after training it's above 20.

"I rented for a few years several blocks from the tracks (just east of Bowen) and could fairly hear the trains from inside my apartment, but the main issue was lost time waiting for trains. They do seem to have a bit of a schedule, but not always that I could tell. I seem to remember one coming through a few minutes before eight most days, and if I was running a little late I’d get stuck waiting for it and be late for work.

"As /u/bbene says, the biggest issue will be what side of the tracks you're on; if you're on the east side of the tracks, you should expect to lose hours of your life waiting at the tracks whenever you're going somewhere. My wife's parents live on that side of town and I feel like I end up getting stuck at a train like 25% of the time. 

I imagine that, over time, you could start to figure out the schedule of the trains and know when to leave early or wait before going somewhere. 

As far as how it impacts **re**sale value: really, it shouldn't, because the negative effect on the price should already exist (meaning the price should already be lower than it would otherwise be if there wasn't a train track nearby). It would only effect resale value if the tracks didn't exist before you bought it.

The bigger issue would probably be time to sell; its proximity to the tracks will likely mean that it will take *longer* to sell, as many prospective buyers will see its location near the tracks and just keep looking, so it will have a smaller pool of potential buyers.",t2_5rn5g,anon_smithsonian,0,1590317340.0,0,t1_frn7q3e,frn7q3e,True,jakobeweb24,t3_gpinyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oshkosh/comments/gpinyd/train_noise/,Train noise...,/r/Oshkosh/comments/gpinyd/train_noise/frn7q3e/,3,r/Oshkosh,0,3

Resale value, I'm not sure. I'm keeping my house (duplex) and renting it. I imagine you'd lose a bit of value due to proximity but if you really want to be there, buying will be a steal.

To me the biggest annoyance was how everything in the city was on the other side of the tracks. It seemed that any time I was in a hurry I would get stuck waiting for a train.

"Anthem apartments are pretty expensive especially for Oshkosh.  My relative lived their for a period of time and back then it was rented out to rich kids or recent retirees.

"The only caveat I'd mention about Havenwood Heights is to make sure you actually look inside the unit you're thinking about renting.

They've been in the process of updating their units (replacing the carpet, linoleum, and appliances) and you definitely want to make sure you get one that is already updated.

We had a friend of ours move into the exact same apartment but in another building about six months after us and they had all brand new carpeting and appliances, but we had kinda ratty carpet and appliances made in the early 90s.

The dishwasher in our unit was literally over 22 years old (I actually looked up the serial number on it to find out). It was so loud that you really couldn't run the dishwasher while you in the living room watching TV. We complained about it at least 3 times over the 5-6 years we were there and they would just come over, look at it and run it, and say ""Well it works fine, it's just kinda loud."" 

Other than that, though, they were pretty nice apartments.

"Most people get along just fine with front wheel drive.  Especially if you're mostly driving around town, it's just fine.  You just have to be careful to stay out of deep snow and remember that it can take extra time to get going when you're pulling out into traffic.  It's also important to remember that most of the roads aren't constantly bad.  It snows every so often, the roads are bad for a day or two, and then they're plowed and everything is back to normal.

With that being said, last winter was my first time with (real) AWD.  I bought a Subaru, and the difference is night and day.  It doesn't stop in slippery conditions better than any other car, but it starts out faster and maintains traction better.  AWD/4WD isn't a requirement, but I definitely feel safer.  I commute on the freeway every day, and my trips in my previous car (2006 Audi A3, which is particularly bad in the snow) were white knuckle.  Not anymore.

Regardless of what you decide, remember to always leave early when commuting.  Don't let traffic speeds be your guide to how fast you should go.  Especially on the freeway, most people drive faster than they should in the snow.  If you buy AWD, you lose your safety advantages if you go faster.  Nothing makes up for driving carefully at a sensible speed.  Also, not all AWD systems are the same, but I can highly recommend any Subaru.",t2_6kp8l,ultra242,0,1570284500.0,0,t1_f2kejs0,f2kejs0,True,[deleted],t3_ddn6v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oshkosh/comments/ddn6v3/winter_roads_in_oshkosh/,Winter roads in Oshkosh,/r/Oshkosh/comments/ddn6v3/winter_roads_in_oshkosh/f2kejs0/,1,r/Oshkosh,0,1

"Just curious, why Oshkosh? If his job pays well enough that a 90+ minute commute is worth it, you could live in any of the suburbs outside of Milwaukee that have nice areas. You could move to the upper east side or further north like Glendale/Whitefish Bay, go somewhere like Brookfield or New Berlin, or head further west like Hartland, Delafield, Pewaukee, Oconomowoc, Sussex, Merton, etc.. You will find much better school systems in those areas for your daughter as well. Menomonee Falls, Stoughton, Mukwonogo.. there are seriously so many better places to move.

If you really need to get out of the area, Fond du Lac is a little bit closer than Oshkosh. If Oshkosh is already determined then I would personally move somewhere on the south west side of town near the highway. There will be a lot of times when the commute really sucks regardless of where in town you live, especially in the summer. I think the plows take care of the highway pretty early in the morning, but winter will also suck.

West Bend, Hartford, Grafton, Mequon, Port Washington, Slinger, Franklin, Waterford, hell even Kenosha are all places I would consider moving before Oshkosh, in addition to the above, if I was working in Milwaukee.

Not trying to disrespect Oshkosh (too much), just have no idea why you'd want to move here and continue working in Milwaukee.

"There’s some “beaches” on the lake, but calling them beaches is really charitable. For volleyball, The Bar has leagues, as does Revs and I think Terry’s.

There’s several distinct types of bars depending on what you’re looking for. Molly’s and French Quarter on campus are the closest thing to a “club” type environment on the weekends (college heavy). The Main Street bars come in several varieties - I like Peabody’s and Barley and Hops, which are both pretty chill and have nice outdoor space. Peabody’s also regularly has live music, as does Reptile Palace, which is more on the divey side of things. Honestly, you could make a few nights of just having one drink at each bar on Main Street and check them all out.

If you can get access to a boat the lake is also a great resource. There are a handful of sand bars that people congregate at in the summer. There’s also several docks open to the public for fishing. There’s also several good bike trails and parks.

You haven’t asked about food, but make sure you check out The Roxy at some point. Old fashioned but delicious. There really are a tone of good food options... West End pizza is my personal favorite local pizza but if you love cheese go with Ratch & Deb’s.

"It would be crazy not to be in favor of selling the land. You will hear that families will lose their income and no offense to them, but how many jobs does a public golf course that doesn't make money actually create? There are almost 14k people who work for Oshkosh Corp who would either lose their jobs or be forced to move, 14k people instantly removed from the economy of Oshkosh. Other cities have made very attractive offers for Oshkosh Corp to move to their city. We're talking millions in free land, construction, and tax breaks. We're talking about SELLING poorly utilized land costing taxpayers money to a company who made over $6 billion in revenue last year. 

There are PLENTY of other golf courses in the area that aren't a taxpayer money pit.

Luckily from what I've heard there is almost no chance Oshkosh doesn't decide to sell the land if Oshkosh Corp wants it. A few private groups have also come forward to pledge money for the construction of the building to compete with these other cities. The people against the sale of the land seems to be a very vocal minority compared to a silent majority that wants the right thing to happen.

"As an Oshkosh native... I think I'm inclined to side with selling the land... for a couple reasons, one is that I believe that area specifically could use some new development, there are a good number of empty lots since the roundabounts went in.  There are several locations that would work perfect for roadways without adding any new lights.

The problem with looking at course income/expenses is that you aren't entitled to the whole picture... we'd probably need to see like 20 years of numbers to see where they are at with investment and income generation. I think the area has enough golf courses and this one isn't even truly on the water... it's near the edge, but it's not really utilizing the location to it's fullest. The road/driveway has the best view other than the clubhouse. I think I've played there maybe once in my life, so I suppose I'm in the realm of people who don't utilize it and don't know if it's necessary.  I don't even know how it compares to other local courses... I think Winchester if that is still around is probably comparable?? Cheap, not fancy golf options?  Also, I heard that the proposal was to sell a portion of the course, does that mean they would just reduce the size?  Or would they look to sell the land to other developers?  

I haven't seen much information... so I suppose I really shouldn't base my opinion off 2nd hand info.  Oshkosh Corp has pretty much scooped up any empty property that has opened up that would handle offices... they are spread all over the place, what would happen to those locations? Would they become dormant?

I own property in Osh, but don't live there, so I can't vote... unfortunately.

"I would not be worried. Oshkosh is a safe place. I chuckle at the thought of there being unsafe places to avoid, but then again I've lived in a city where there are actually parts of town you don't go to. 

My best advice if you're going to be walking around late at night is stay on well lit roads. But I've walked all over town between 10pm-3am and have not had any issues. Generally though I'm not walking alone and when there are reportings of an incident it happens to someone alone. Stuff happens by the campus sometimes. Still, I'm pretty sure the most dangerous part of town for a drunk person late at night is the river, lol. 

I did have my car broken into once on the south side but that's about it. If for some reason you're feeling insecure then remember Wisconsin is a conceal carry state :)

If you live somewhere that you'll be walking home late at night where you can't find a well lit road to walk down (Main St, Oregon St, Wisconsin St, Jackson St. New York Ave, 9th Ave, South Park Ave should all be fine and can get you most places you need to go) and you don't feel safe then I would probably just call an Uber/Lyft or a cab.

"For grocery stores, Roundys (Pick n Save) was recently bought out by Kroger. This has drastically improved the prices at the Pick n Saves here. There is one on the north side and one on the south side of town. On the west side there is Festival Foods which is a pretty large store. More expensive but generally better produce and meat/fish. There is also a Pigy Wiggly on the north side but I've never been impressed with that place. I personally do not shop at Wal Mart and you won't find a ton of meat/produce at Target, but both of those stores exist. We also have an Aldi's which I LOVE, but I don't always trust their produce. Great prices though, and most of their store brand items are organic and just rebranded Trader Joe's products.

For GOOD meat, Becks and Ski's are both on main Street and you really can't go wrong. Becks is a smaller shop while Ski's has more of a market. Depends what you're looking for. The Butcher Block closed years ago so not sure what that other poster is talking about.

About 20-25 minutes north of Oshkosh is Appleton and they have a Woodman's which is a large store that is employee owned so the prices are pretty decent. They also have a Costco and a Sam's Club if you're into those places.

As mentioned we have a Farmers Market open on Main Street Saturday mornings June 1 - Oct 31 full of vendors. It is one of the better Farmers Markets in the state but my experience is all the fresh stuff is more expensive. Still though I'll buy pretty much any vegetables I need from there if I can since it generally tastes so much better fresh and you're supporting local farmers.

ISP you pretty much only have Spectrum, so prepare your anus. Yes it is the same as Time Warner Cable and has now conbined with Charter. They suck especially if you have Cable but they do have a new 300mb plan if you really need it. 

Weather - Coming from Florida make sure you have a nice warm coat. I would also consider some long sleeve and pant under armour or long stockings. Water proof boots help a ton for removing the wet snow. Get a snowblower if you can, you can usually find them at most price ranges on Craigslist used. Otherwise don't cheap out on a shovel. In January it WIll reach a point of -30 wind chill and you will be sorry if you aren't prepared. Start your cars 15-20 minutes before you need to go anywhere on those days because most businesses aren't shutting down. Make sure you have driveway salt for the ice. For driving in the snow, not much to say other than getting a feel for your conditions. Snow generally isn't difficult, it's the ice you need to watch out for. Brake earlier and watch yourself around turns. In Wisconsin we are pretty prepared for the conditions so there will usually be a ton of salt on the roads melting the ice and making it easier to drive. All in all if the roads are too icy then don't go anywhere or work from home if that's an option. 

Shopping - depending on what you're looking for. There are a bunch of outlet shops on the south west side of town. The Skiers Outlet or the North Face outlet are good places to look for warm clothing. There are a whole bunch of Outlet stores in that area so you'll be checking them out at some point. Appleton also has your more traditional mall in a pretty busy shopping/business district. You'll find whatever you need up there if you can't find it in Oshkosh. 

You (or more specifically your girlfriend) may also find some shops you like on Main Street for clothing but they have weird hours and not much for men. The antique mall (name slipped my brain) is neat and the Exclusive Company is a good music store. Oaks Candy Corner is great for sweets. There is an awesome comic book shop if you're into that stuff.

Renting is a tough one in Oshkosh if you need to do it. My biggest recommendation is to stay away from the UW campus as much as possible. The housing is shit and the landlords are scummy as hell. I've heard nothing but horrible things about most of the rental management properties that you see searching online. Craigslist is probably your best bet but you need to act quickly. After having really terrible landlords I finally found a decent one. I had seen the CL posting an hour a after it was up and he took the posting down the same day. My extremely general advice is don't live somewhere where the landlord is doing it for extra income or as a hobby. Find someone who does this for a living, but not the standard ""owns 11 apartment complexes"" that all look the same and don't care about you. It is tough advice but you really need to be patient and lucky in some sense. Sorry that advice sucks but I've been burned by too many landlords in this town that have honestly made living at home a shitty thing. 

Not sure where you like to do for fun. There is a nice movie theater here with $5 movies on Tuesdays. A couple disc golf courses though nothing too great compared to other cities I've lived in. There are a decent amount of golf courses around. Main Street and South Park usually have stuff going on like Craft shows and other events that bring vendors and food trucks in. South Park, Menominee Park, and Winnebago County parks are all very nice. Tennis Courts and basketball courts can be found all over town. 

Nightlife - again not sure what you're into. I'm pretty over the bar scene here but Main Street has its fair share of bars with different kinds of crowds. A lot of them have side yards which is great for the summer, especially for music.

Oshkosh is getting a D League basketball team to serve as a development team for the Bucks. The arena is almost finished, and surely there will be plenty of other events held there if basketball isn't your thing. Appleton also has the Timer Rattlers, which is a single A minor league team for the Brewers. Usually pretty inespensive entertainment. There is a comedy club in Appleton that is pretty decent too.

In the summer there are some pretty big events. EAA is absolutely nuts. It's an airshow that brings in people from all over the world. I worked retail while going to school and always enjoyed talking to people from England, Brazil, you name it. 

There is also Country USA which is just awful, but brings in a lot of headliners if country music is your thing. But dear God, do yourself a favor and go to Wal Mart during CUSA just for the people watching. You won't be sorry. 

Also there's Rockfest (or is it Rock USA, can't remember) but that's usually a pretty decent one. I've never been there personally but it's held in the same spot as CUSA. also Lifest which is the same but more.. religiousy I think. 

Back by Menominee Park there is Sawdust Days which is probably more fun for kids with the rides and such but not a bad spot if you're looking to get outside and have a drink while listening to random music. 

Anyway I hope this helps a bit. Feel free to  reply or PM me if you have any more questions. I've only lived in Oshkosh for about 5-6 years and I can't say I ""fit in"" to the culture here but we definitely get by and manage to not be too bored here.

"For Food: 
theres farmer markets downtown a lot, idk the dates,  fresh strawberries, corn, and etc stands by rogans shoes, the old sears between dairy queen and two brothers (really good and cheap food btw), an old restaurant on 9th near knapp I believe, town of algoma town hall, and lots more I cant remember right now as its 3:45 lol. Grocery stores in order from my opinion:
1 Festival
2 walmart
3 pick n save
4 piggly wigglys
5 target
also ik theres a store called the butcher block, has high quality meat from all-organic grass fed elk to regular hamburger. 

For ISP's all I know is that charter communications, or spectrum now I believe, has a very big monopoly in oshkosh, which sucks, But I have seen other ISP's pop up in the area time n time again, idk how good they are though... And if you do choose charter or whatever the monopoly goes by now, CHECK YOUR BILLS, they are KNOWN to increase your monthly payment even if you had a signed contract, itll bump like $20 every once in a while so watch out.

For winter driving:
Have 2 sets of tires for driving, I have some nice cheap beaters for summer, and usually you want nice expensive tires for winter, but my cheap yokohamos from carid are reallly nice and have saved my life countless of times from black ice and etc,  especially when I wasnt looking and ranover a curb lol, though the yokohamo's did have a recall because the inner diameter of the rubber was bigger then it needed to be which I found out when I put them on, its my only complaint. for summer anything is good, so just go to a local junkyard or craigslist it for cheap summer tires with decent tread. Make sure to get the bottom of your car rust proof, or somesort of preventitive maintenance because the salt from the roads will eat your car. 

Things to let you know: 
do not walk down roads in the lower income areas alone, lots of my friends have been robbed. cruising down main at night is bad too, lots of drunks ive almost killed, and the roundabouts, omg, the key I realised is that you need to kinda go a little fast in them to not get stuck, but be safe of course! and do not use your blinker at all UNLESS you are signaling to move into another lane in the round about. because thats how accidents happen when someone just leaves it on going through the roundabout (sounds stupid but trust me).
and lastly adventure, there are lots of fun things to do wether it be with eaa, or all the big concerts, but be careful of where and how you park, about 25-30% of the cars I see have door bang marks on em, and be weary of drunk people, say the wrong thing about packers, politics, or cheese, you might die...",t2_wpx9v,polymersauder,0,1498381988.0,0,t1_djdfg4d,djdfg4d,True,[deleted],t3_6jdb8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oshkosh/comments/6jdb8l/moving_to_oshkosh_from_florida_soon_everything_i/,Moving to Oshkosh from Florida soon.

"Bemis is a really big company, so I think most of it will really just depend on what facility you're at and what department or area you are in. 

In my experience working there for three years, they do seem to pay quite well and have pretty good benefits... however, when I was there and in the facility/department I was in, the turnover rate was still quite high. This, though, was largely due to our manager who was a stunning example of being promoted to their highest level of incompetency. He was extremely unprofessional (in a department meeting, he flat out said ""There people are lined up around the block to work here. Everyone is replaceable."") and had numerous complaints about him to HR but nothing was ever really done... he'd lay low, for awhile, but eventually he would be back to doing the same kind of crap. 

But that's not necessarily going to be true for you and whatever job you're considering... however, I never really felt like the company cared or appreciated its employees (or even just *pretended* too). 

After three years, there, and no sign of anything ever changing or getting better, I eventually just had enough and quit. Working there was making me miserable and it was leaking out into my life outside of work. I ended up taking a pay cut by leaving, but I was infinitely happier and, now, am making more than I had been there.

"26F here, my husband and I have a townhouse on the west side of town (by Walmart, Fleet Farm, etc) and still frequent the Main St bars, which are probably going to be the ones you'd want to go to. There's a much bigger young person crowd around there. Just wanted to give you a comparison about what you'd get over on the North/Central side vs West.

We lived in a 400 sqft apartment off of Jackson St and paid $450/mo with just water included. We were within 1mi walking distance to the bars and 1mi from campus. Now we live on the west side, and pay $505/mo for a 2br townhouse, lawn/snow care included, 1 car garage, and it's quiet and super nice and probably about 900sqft. We don't have anything included but we are friends with all of our neighbors and all pay about the same amount per month for utilities and water -- about $80-100/mo for utilities and $120/quarter for water. But we all have dishwashers, washers, and multiple people in the house.

A cab from the Main St bars to where we live is about $15 after the tip and a hell of a lot cheaper than an OWI + parking ticket. An uber is approx the same cost if it's not surging. And there are 3-5 uber drivers in the area and they all hang around Main St on the weekends.

If you want the convenience of walking to the main area of town, you'll have the slightly higher cost for rent and whatnot. I love living in Oshkosh and don't see myself going anywhere for quite a while.

"It's freaking brutal in Oshkosh right now for the schools.  Did I read correctly that they are killing Home Ec and Industrial arts?  I wasn't quite sure how to interpret the names they used.  

As an Oshkosh Native and graduate of the public schools system, I can say that Oshkosh used to have a pretty nice education system, however, things have been on a downward slope from what I can tell... now I'm an outsider, I have property in Oshkosh, but I live outside the city now, so I can't vote on the referendums, and I don't have any kids, but killing their sports programs along with art and technology stuff isn't the answer.

Art and music are pretty important, I think...

Also, teaching kids how to make food, balance a checkbook/accounts, and/or how to use tools... is all freaking essential in my book!  I'm appalled at how incompetent some of my younger co-workers are at basic life skills.  Cooking something that doesn't come in a box shouldn't be extraordinary, it should be standard.  Being able to read some directions and put something together should be a basic skill, even it it requires some hand tools.  I learned many of those skills in middle school, because in High School, you generally start focusing your electives towards what you want to do for the rest of your life, I planned to go into technology, so I took some business classes and all the computer classes that I could, along with some of my other interests beyond the basics, but it was nice to have some basics to build off of from Middle School, when you get in the real world and have to change a flat tire... and didn't take auto mechanics.  It's not rocket science, but you'd be surprised how many young adults these days would just call somebody, rather than dig out the widowmaker jack and get the spare installed.

"I've had [Community First Credit Union](http://www.communityfirstcu.org/) since I originally moved to Oshkosh back in 2011. I have never had any problems and they have been very helpful with car loans or credit consolidation. I've also had them while living in Kenosha for a while and they didn't mind at all (keeping in mind the closest southern branch is in Oshkosh).
