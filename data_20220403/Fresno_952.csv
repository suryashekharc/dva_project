"Instance one: it’s 3:30am, I’m asleep on the couch in front of the TV.  There is *pounding* on my door.  I answer it, and one of three cops immediately starts peppering me with questions concerning a drunk driving accident way out in Clovis (I’m in Fresno).  Asks why I “wrecked my car and just left it in an intersection” a half hour ago.  “I didn’t,” I say.  “I was here, sleeping.”  It’s clear he’s trying to show off for the other cops he’s with, one of whom seems to be in training.  After a few minutes of accusations regarding a hit and run, yet not listening to my answers at all, I start to get pissed off.  The commotion wakes my wife up, who comes to the door in her bathrobe, totally confused.  He seems to calm a down a bit, realizes there might be more to it than he thought.  Meanwhile, the woman in training is out looking at my car—she comes back and says, low as not to embarrass him, “I think someone just stole their license plate and put it on another car.”  Sure enough, that’s exactly what happened.  But he won’t let it go, he *still* thinks I had something to do with it.  So I ask: “you think I
A: took *my own* license plate
B: put it on another car
C: stole that car, and then 
D: wrecked it, and then what—took a taxi back to my house, where the stolen car’s license plate would lead you directly to my *own house*?!?”  
He sheepishly admits his mistake, and bids me good evening.  Fucking asshole.  Gaping.  

Instance two: I get pulled over for “not having a light above my license plate.”  This is a common one, used when cops want to pull someone over for no reason but need to say *something*.  Cop starts asking me about burglaries in the area, asking if I go by the alias “Jimmy D.”  He asks what I’m doing out at midnight, I tell him I’m coming home from work (which I am).  My box cutter is on my seat in a leather holster.  He asks what it is, and I say, “my box cutter, I can show you.”  He shouts, “don’t reach for that!” putting his hand on his gun.  I’m white—otherwise I might be dead.  He eventually just runs my name and lets me go.

"Around 9pm on a weeknight I heard loud pounding on my door when I lived in an apartment complex a few years back. I look through the peephole and see nothing. Like an idiot I get curious and I start to step outside. 4 cops that were hiding out of sight turn around the corner with their guns drawn pointed at me. One of them had a big smile as he got inches from my face like a “ha, we got him boys” type smile if that makes sense.

He starts shouting “Where’s Sergio?!?!! Where’s Sergio?!?” I explained that I had no idea who that person is. Eventually they buy my story and leave. It was such a bizarre experience. Not sure if maybe that person had a warrant for his arrest and they were trying to catch him?

"I’m on the board of an aquarium. Can confirm it’s ridiculously expensive to maintain the tanks. For every square foot of floorplace a tank has, you need about 1/3 of that behind the scenes for water cycling. A pump for a single, medium sized tank is about $16k to replace. If the power goes out for more than 15 mins, the water circulation stops and fish start dying. That means you have to have powerful generators and staff on call to make sure they kick on properly within 15 mins. We spend $10k a year just on salt as a fairly small aquarium. 

Beyond that, aquatic animals generally have shorter lifespans. We choose to have a necropsy on every one that dies to ensure it wasn’t due to a bacteria that could spread.

"Accepting for now your statement that no one ""deserves"" anything, and noting you brought up this idea of that in this world, our world, work is required, can you share with us the time when as a child your family were granted food stamps and describe the ""work"" you undertook to obtain them. Perhaps no work was required, or no ""work"" was even offered as a realistic way to earn your foodstamps/healthcare, in that case what sort of ""work"" would you suggest we have children in a situation like yours back then, be given to recieve either food stamps or healthcare. Thanks :)

To those who are labelling this conservative ideology, I suppose in much conservatism that is true, but it is no universal, there are conservative viewpoints that do not require a child, nor their mother or family, to work for any foodstamps and healthcare they receive, even if there was work and they were fully onboard with not ""deserving"" but ""working"" for such services.

"This article gives more answers and less wonder on why it's taking so long. Sad to hear no one wants to support this. Not even rich local investors. And as it said they asked around the country and once they see the demographics they were like nope. The low income, poverty rating prob discouraged outside investors. Wish the local govs like the city and or county can support this to make it a reality. Give a tourist attraction for people to come to Fresno other than the zoo. At least this could be a year round attraction. Field trips for entire central California region instead of going further to the bay.

"Ballpark estimates for replacement parts for something from Walmart, Dick's, Target, etc:

A tube is 10$. A tire is 20-30$. A chain is 20$. One cable & housing for it is 15$.

Building a bike from a box is about 75.

When I talk about ""average cost to repair"" it means making the bike safe to ride at the bare minimum spec. It doesn't factor in when people are totally fine riding without brakes, or bent rims, stripped bolts, or any of the other typical problems problems that plague entry-level bikes.

People in this town usually sell busted bikes for cheap because they usually paid 50$ for it themselves, busted it further, and didn't repair anything more than a tube and tire.

"if you're buying a used bike for 50$ then it's highly likely you're buying stolen goods, a piece of shit, or both.

take it from someone who diagnoses bike repairs for too many gullible yard sale bargain shoppers. The average bill of repairing that 50$ bike is 300$, *and* the bike is usually still very low spec.

y'all do not understand why bikes cost what they do.

25$ an hour to rent an e-bike is a whole other story. Still seems high for the average low income & the target market for bike sharing here, but keep in mind, you're not paying to rent the dumpy rusted frame that comes from the pawn shop.

"Is this a real question? If 75% of people fail and 25% succeed, 25% are the exception. That's how statistics work. 

The problem comes up when those 25% think they're more than they really are (survivorship bias), blinding them to a wider reality beyond their personal experience.  You can't change the fact that class mobility out of poverty isn't great here, that graduation rates for kids without educated parents are low,  that low income areas predict poor school results which predict poor higher education, the list just goes on and on. Just the way it is. 

You just cannot approach systemic analysis from personal experience. 

On the flip side, my sibling *wasn't* an exception. See how anecdotes work? That's why we can't lean on them. You have to do systemic analysis to draw systemic conclusions, period.

"Most of the stuff mentioned are cool places. Shaver is my favorite and usually not too crowded. If you don't like typical locations DO NOT go to Yosemite, is cool but always super crowded and beautiful but not too special or unique. I wouldn't waste time on Woodward park, again nice place but nothing super special (locals just love it probably because is the nicest one around). Similar case with downtown nothing wow but there's not a lot to do at night so why not go check it out and have some drinks. Obvious but just is case: this is all my personal opinion.

Go see a movie at one of the many movie theaters like Sierra Vista or 4D at Edwards. Bowlero is a nice place to bowl, but visit the one in Clovis. The one off of Blackstone is shady.
There’s a well coordinated escape room on Shaw and Minnewawa.
Underground Gardens is a Fresno essential visit, just check for reservations.
Woodward Park is a nice place to kick back and go for a walk. Place is huge and near some great restaurants nearby.
Detention in Tower District is a great place to play pool and grab some drinks. Speaking of drinks, we have an active and growing beer and bar scene. You can bar hop in Tower and Downtown has a brewery district. Clovis also has some scattered around or in Old Town specifically. Hit up Gazebo Gardens off of Van Ness on the weekends for awesome food trucks and beer.
IMO, head up to one of the national parks right now. Flowers are mostly in bloom, weather is perfect, and there are no fires. Come summer it’s going to be hell. Just be careful on the roads and check for construction before leaving. Also be prepared to pay the entrance fee. We also have Shaver, Huntington and Bass Lakes about an hour and a half away.

"Poverty exists in those outlying communities for sure but homelessness is minimal in those areas compared to Fresno. Ag workers make the same or more than people working fast food. I work in the ag industry and know first hand many ag employees are paid $16-$20 an hour depending on their job duties. That’s more than I made with a college degree in 2009. I also know firsthand that very few have addresses in the city of Fresno except those who live in apartments because they’re only here a few months out of the year. 

Many don’t live in the area full time. They may work 6 months then go to Mexico. Many send money to their families in Mexico. Many don’t know their living conditions are what we consider subpar because they’re still better than what they had before. I’ve seen people making $1200/week (net) and complaining it’s not enough. There could always be other reasons they live the way they do. 

All of this to say, there are people who will take advantage of ag employees (any employees for that matter) but most of what I have seen are employers who take good care of their employees. There are also some employees who take advantage of the benefits created by the system but many don’t.

"> plus people don't sell their old homes but just make them rentals, essentially enslaving people via real estate.

Most people sell their old homes.  The issue is homes in the lower-income areas are often purchased by people who want to invest in rentals.  The other problem is people who want to buy a home often  don't want to buy the 1100 sq ft homes that need work.

"My cat got out a few years ago when my uncle was watching him up at his place in Madera while I was out of town and what got him back was using an animal trap cage. I put a shirt I had been wearing for a day so he’d smell my scent and feel more at ease and placed a little food in there and it worked within 24 hours. He had been missing for about a little over a week too. I don’t know if this will help at all, but just in case it does I decided to comment. I just looked it up and you can pick up those types of cages at Lowes, Home Depot, harbor freight, and I think possibly Walmart. 

Your cat looks so much like mine too. I’ll keep an eye out as well and I’ll spread the word. I can post it on my Facebook as well if you want and a picture of the posters you made, just let me know.

"We're talking about the City of Fresno.  I couldn't find the current statistics for current agricultural employment in the City of Fresno, but sometime around 20 years ago it was .6%.  That's in the city limits. Calling the city of Fresno a agricultural community is misleading.  The Fresno County Economic Development Corporation states that farm related employment is about 46,000 people in the Fresno MSA.  That's all of Fresno and Madera Counties.  Very few of those people live in the City of Fresno.  The poverty in Firebaugh, San Joaquin, and other rural communities is due to ag.  The poverty in Fresno is due to the overwhelming number of service and other low-paying jobs, low educational attainment, and the failure of local government to attract any employer more significant than a T-mobile call center and and Amazon warehouse.

"For years Fresno has been [#2 for concentrated poverty](https://fedinprint.org/item/fedfcw/21912/original) in the United States according to the Southern Policy Law Center. This attached study is from 2009. 












[Fresno is also #2 for extreme poverty.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.fresnobee.com/news/local/article209826869.html). This article is from 2018. 











This is not new but can be shocking to anyone and everyone. It’s a lot of POC who carry the burden of poverty in some of the richest cities in the US. It’s mind blowing that we look at “3rd world countries” and don’t see that we are not far behind at all, if not on the same page. We don’t have universal healthcare, something every other rich nation has. Education rates are low in poorer neighborhoods because the money and resources aren’t there since property taxes are relied on to fund these schools. The black community is especially hard hit in Fresno.

"This might not help well, but I'll provide my input anyways...

If You Go There In Person:
1) Are you dealing with the Same Person?
2) If so, what is The Story they are trying to sell you? The same thing maybe?

Reason I asked, is if that's the scenario then somebody else higher up needs to be beckoned at your request/concerns. 

Long story short, when I was in the army, some dumb SOB at the battalion post office just willingly let my package go because he didn't check the dude's military ID. 

The ONLY REASON I found out what happened was I got tired of looking for my package like 3 times in two weeks is because I finally requested the manager (in my case, the head postal clerk) and not only discovered the thief's name, but his location (that was inside our very own barracks).

"Best advice I can give is to walk the area, with god, and shake the kibble in a bowl or something while calling out the cats name. 

Make sure to listen—your cat is scared and afraid but will know your voice and respond. But he may meow quietly at first, not wanting to expose himself. 

I have found several lost animals, and this was how I found one of my cats who had gotten lost during an unexpected thunderstorm.

Also: cats are usually found pretty close to where they get lost. They don’t go very far, maybe a quarter mile or half mile. If they’re chased, then they may end up further.

Putting your face and personality to your application really does help. It also shows you have initiative and actually want the position. 

Another tip is to bring a cover letter with your application. In it, tell then at least three ways you will bring value to the job position. This can be things like expertise in a certain area that is above and beyond the job description or being interested in working for the company for a long time.

"many people--majority actually, base their school opinions from those school ratings online. A lot of clovis unified schools have very high ratings on various school rating sites and databases. When the general casual person looks at that, case closed and done. That is really all they go by and as I said that is what the general public go by. BUT just like you mentioned and others who chime in, people will give contrasting stories. Unfortunately accounts and experiences like yours is far and few and still doesnt sway the general person curious about school for their kids over the stats from these school sites. Not to mention the blue ribbon awards that many clovis unified schools get. I'm not saying you are incorrect, but you also can't say people who go based on stats and data are incorrect. One can hear opinions of great experiences from those who went through central unified or fresno unified, but it would be hardpressed to convince them to pick that over official statistics of test scores and college attainment. There are a lot of things INBETWEEN THE LINES that arent talked about. Another being that those in more affluent areas which have been mentioned, have bigger percentage of families where a parent does not work and can focus more on their kids compared to lower income areas where both have to work and cant be as involved in their kids lives. This is crucial in child development and success in some aspects of education that isnt really studied.

"Selma is pretty country, not very nice in my opinion. Good place to buy a car though. Selma auto mall has everything and cheaper than most dealerships in the valley. I have friends that live in Visalia, they hate the schools and the gangs are getting out of hand. But Visalia does have a great downtown and an awesome children's museum. But you don't need to live there to enjoy them. I do like Hanford it's small but clean and feels safe. They have a cute little mall. Housing in Hanford is a little overpriced if you ask me. But like a few others have mentioned you should really be wary of the fog it is literally deadly. Huge pileups every year on the 99 especially in the colder months. In fact fog is a huge issue everywhere in the valley except for Fresno and some parts of Clovis. Also any story people on here are mentioning about crime are probably absolutely true. The whole Central Valley is infested with crime. There is something horrible on the news daily and no matter where you choose to live you are going to be dealing with crime. It's actually so bad that I am looking to relocate my family because I can't take it anymore. When searching for a new place I specifically searched for low crime rates and affordable housing. Housing around here has gone up more than 30 percent just this last year and it's definitely not worth the premium. So I'm going to sell my house while it's up and more than likely end up in some place like Pennsylvania where it's cheap and low on crime. I'm not trying to scare you but just being realistic. Also the weather is awful and the air quality is some of the worst in the country. The only good thing about living here now is that it's centrally located and it's an easy day trip to Yosemite, Sequoia, Pismo, SF, and LA. So I guess the best part is you can escape pretty easily.

"By statistics, the best area with best schools is 93730, 93720, and not all of Clovis but North Clovis. 93730 arguably the best, being around Copper River area. 93720 just falls south of that area. You have the city of fresno on your address but live in the highest median income per household and price of homes and attend Clovis unified. North Clovis--north of herndon going all the way east to harlan ranch. Similar vibe and atmosphere you'll see from 93720 and 93730 but now street signs are brown meaning you are in clovis and some like this because they dont have the city of Fresno on their address. 93711 is also nice in north fresno and touches NE fresno and goes through the posh and upscale neighborhood of Van Ness Extension and to Fig Garden Loop and on the south end going towards old fig. A mix of modern homes and older very kept up well neighborhoods. Mature trees and landscaping that was kept up. Much more charming than the cookie cutter stuff you mostly see in 93730, 93720, and north clovis. Only concern for you in 93711 are schools. I dont think they fall in Clovis unified. A good value option is NW fresno, which consist of 93722 and 93723. These areas are much more diverse in cultures, more middle class folk but with sprinkle of the upper tier folks that are more prominent in the other places mentioned whom can be found along the bluffs of 93722. I say this is a good value because most of the areas mimic the other higher choices mentioned but at cheaper per sq ft price. You have arguably one of the best shopping strips in Fresno that isnt river park or fashion fair over in Marketplace at El Paseo. The school district is Central unified which is good but depends on which schools K-8 you are asigned to. I say this because 93722 spans a big area all the way south to where it becomes the places people tell you to avoid. But for the most parts, 93722 in and around shaw and north are good and developing ands schools are mostly good and a brand new high school is in the works.

"I definitely recommend looking at Visalia. My wife and I bought a house in Visalia recently, and our purchasing power went much farther than it would have in Fresno and Clovis. They are also building more homes towards the 99 and Kingsburg, whereas Clovis and Fresno are only growing north and east, which means a new home there will cost more commute time where Visalia would be less. 

A couple spots downtown are a bit sketchy, but there’s some good restaurants and I don’t ever feel unsafe going to lunch or dinner. It still feels like a small town, but it has everything you need. Fresno is only 40 mins away if you need something you can’t get, and we make trips up regularly.

"Kingsburg K-8 is a charter school district. I went there K-12 and was always told it was a fantastic place for students from outsiders. Most definitely notice a difference in my education compared to others who went elsewhere but I'm now in my 30s so can't say for sure how much has changed despite a lot of the same teachers and admin. Fwiw I have friends with kids in the district and they all speak pretty highly/make an effort to keep the kids there.      
      
I'd keep in mind it is a small town that has its charm but also has small town problems. It's also very conservative leaning, that can also be pretty archaic and biblical that many teachers have no problem bringing into the classroom.

I've lived in Selma and Visalia before as well. Even though Visalia is pretty close to Kingsburg I wouldn't recommend the commute lots of accidents and really thick fog between the two points. Can't say much for Selma but living wise, I unfortunately can't really suggest it unless it's in a new development but the town wide problems probably outweigh the benefits.

"I would say Clovis for good schools and overall generally safety and very family oriented. Clovis is definitely on the conservative side. North and northeast Fresno also have good schools but safety is a little hit and miss. Avoid south, southeast, southwest, and Downtown Fresno. Tower District is very liberal and artsy with older homes with character.Tower is located just north of downtown and south of Fresno High school. Schools are generally decent but once again safety is hit and miss. Old Fig Garden is very safe but also very expensive but schools are not generally very good. When looking at neighborhoods definitely use Google street view because the bad neighborhoods are super easy to spot that way. I personally like central Fresno between the Tower District and old Fig Garden. It's called the Fresno High neighborhood. Very safe lots of people walking their dogs. You frequently see women walking alone at night. Schools are decent. Very economically diverse. Close to everything. You can find housing at pretty much any budget. Crime unfortunately is everywhere. Mostly property crimes but it's not uncommon to hear gunshots almost daily in most parts of the city. The homeless population is also out of control here. Our indoor malls are crawling with gangs and I personally would never shop there anymore. There are a few good outdoor shopping centers Fig Garden Village, River Park, and the newer Shops at El Paseo. Wow this post is long. Sorry about that.

"That depends on what you mean by best. Most Indians I know will tell you that the best Indian food is from their moms kitchen which really isn’t in the kitchen but in their garage cooked with gas propane. Lol.

That being said… do you want authentic straight out of India on metal lunch trays? Hit up Punjabi Dhaba. It’s pretty deep on the south east side (Golden State and Chestnut) and primarily for the Indian truckers passing thru the valley. But oh man is it crazy good. Butter Chicken is my recommendation. 

If you want fast Indian fusion hit up Bollywood on Cedar and Herndon in the John’s Incredible Pizza shopping center. I’d describe as a great gateway into Indian Cuisine. Easy to understand options and it’s usually super fresh and quick. I Recomended the Black Pepper Fried Fish. 

A more new/recent option that has had nothin but great reviews even from my Indian buddies is Apni Mandhi market. 180fwy and Peach Ave) It takes like 30+ mins to get your food cuz it’s made from scratch but totally worth the wait. Make sure to call ahead. It’s takeout only.
