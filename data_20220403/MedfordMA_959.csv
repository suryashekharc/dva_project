"Medford resident here ‚Äî our kids are both in daycare still so I can‚Äôt speak to the quality of the public school system yet. It really depends on what your standards are ‚Äî Medford High School is ranked a ‚ÄúSilver‚Äù school nationally on US News which means it‚Äôs competitive and should provide reasonable opportunities to your child to succeed. Massachusetts in general has great schools so if you‚Äôre coming from most other states ‚Äî other than some key east or west coast ones ‚Äî all MA schools are decent. Medford is not, however, an elite or high ranked school system within Massachusetts ‚Äî it does not break the top 100 for the state for high schools according to US News. It‚Äôs squarely a mid-ranking school for the state, but lots of successful people lived here or were raised here over the years. I personally went to what is a ‚ÄúTop 50‚Äù school system in MA previously so when our kids get older it‚Äôs an open question of what happens for middle/high school but for now ‚Äî we‚Äôre perfectly happy here, in a town that is on the up and up and super close to the city. The Green Line is going to be here and it may cause yet another real estate and commercial boom in the city.

>I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone thinks they need to send their kid to a ‚Äútop ranked‚Äù school for them to succeed

As someone who thinks school ranking are overhyped but who also doesn't discount them completely: I think the biggest reason some people care about school rankings is that they speak to the peer environment. 

Of course there are always caveats and exceptions, but the general perception is that higher test scores mean a greater fraction of students that value academic success and/or are smart. This translates to a greater probability of a student finding academically motivated and/or smart peers, which will influence his own motivation to study and therefore his success. 

Now, to your point, academically motivated students do tend to link up with each other, even if a sizeable portion of the student body doesn't care about school. And of course as parents it is part of our job to instill the virtues of education and hard work into our son, which will in turn influence his friend groups.  

The other way that the general academic motivation and/or intelligence of the student body might matter is that it might affect how far along a class is able to advance. If 75% of the students are not keeping up with the material then the teacher may need to slow down the pace with which they introduce new material, or not delve as deeply into the material. This matters much less in high school once students have the option to select into AP classes, but in grade school not all districts offer advanced courses.",t2_azkl0s6o,SpiritualBayesian,0,1648936211.0,0,t1_i35lwha,i35lwha,False,SpiritualBayesian,t3_tu0w4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/tu0w4w/how_are_the_medford_public_schools/,How are the Medford public schools?,/r/medfordma/comments/tu0w4w/how_are_the_medford_public_schools/i35lwha/,1,r/medfordma,0,1

The high school does offer a bunch of AP classes and you're able to take some college level courses as well through a local community college (bunker hill) to get some gen ed college credits done early. Also worth noting there is also a vocational high school built into the regular high school if your child is interested in that route.  
I wasn't in any clubs myself but there are definitely options for them and sports.  
I'm not sure on funding or the state of school. It was in decent enough shape when I attended (graduated 7 years ago), but it is definitely old and probably could use some work.  
And yes the there are two middle schools right next to each other. I was able to choose which middle school I wanted to go to, but they are pretty much the same.

"Just a little more detail; Real Italian Gusto is owned and operated by a Roman couple, the food is genuine Italian and very good, and they also have a Neopolitan pizza oven that makes pies just like you got in the old country.  I highly recommend it.  Blue Fuji has both sushi and excellent ""american-chinese"" food like General Gau's chicken.  It is definitely a little more expensive, but really well prepared.  It's a nice place for someone fussy about Sushi who likes to go out with someone who really doesn't touch the stuff (like my kid).

There were lots of questions to the new Parking Dept Director about whether she'd change the parking process and move towards either a City Wide permitting system like Somerville or towards a Zone based permitting system like what Boston does (if you ever see signs like ""<Boston Neighborhood> Parking Permit Required"" around Boston, that's what I'm talking about). AFAIK she did not change anything - but the website is still fairly vague about the whole process and probably needs more color and details. For example, why is that link STILL hosted by the Medford Police Department?? Shouldn't there be a nice little link on the new Parking Dept website?? Shouldn't there be a little FAQ with the first question being ""DO I NEED A PERMIT?"" and the answer being ""CHECK THIS LIST FIRST""?? The answer is yes to all those questions but so far the City is still 'figuring shit out' I guess. üôÉ

Also, yes, I did make a Google Map when I first moved here to see which neighborhoods I'd need to be worried about parking wise. You can find it here: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Vm3dq2vpkd6BStO6frYo9Io3Pveu7Yq5

Please double check the Parking List I linked to though for the ultimate source of truth - I haven't updated this map since like 2020 or something and it's totally possible new streets were added... I'd also probably call the Parking Dept and triple check that the list is still accurate and that your street hasn't magically become a permit only street since the transition away from Park Medford to the City Parking Dept. But since the website is vague on this I'm assuming the City didn't change much besides who controls what. I sure hope they overhaul it though and move to a zone based or city wide system. Street by street is such a nightmare to deal with. Somerville and Boston have the right idea with having large parts of the City all be the same...

EDIT: TL&DR: check [this link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Vm3dq2vpkd6BStO6frYo9Io3Pveu7Yq5) for a list of streets probably requiring a permit, and [this link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Vm3dq2vpkd6BStO6frYo9Io3Pveu7Yq5&ll=42.41748834945314%2C-71.10231441962597&z=13) for my unofficial Gmaps of all the permit only streets as of late 2020.

"There is not a consensus as to what it means and there really isn't a proposal on the table. This step if approved at the state level enables the election of a committee to form that proposal. Some are in favor of ward representation, some want to reduce the power of the mayor, some want to move away from a model where the mayor must chair the school committee, some want periodic charter review without requiring permission from the state each time. The proposal formed is then a ballot question in the following election. The only real downside is if you believe the charter that gets adopted will be worse for you than the current charter. A real possibility for the politicians, but a bit of a stretch for households. I am confident that the process will yield a better functioning government, which every voter should be in favor of.

A blue bike station will supposedly go in next to the proposed pot shop that got approved recently (still pending State approvals AFAIK) and there's a lot of potential to add additional blue bike stations on Mystic Ave. 
* walking distance to Main St IF we make Mystic Ave easier to cross (existing crosswalks are sketchy at best and mostly faded to shit)
* walking distance to Wegmans IF we make Mystic Valley Parkway easier to cross (the whole stretch feels like a highway, if MassDOT were to road diet it and make it feel more like an actual _parkway_ people would have no issue walking next to it and crossing it, heck maybe even _biking_ it)
* fairly easy biking distance to Medford Sq, Ball Sq, Wegmans, even Davis Sq _if_ we actually designed our streets right and made them friendly to cyclists. blue bikes and ebikes make this extremely easy for most folks to do, even those without bikes or without much stamina.

I think the biggest thing is the proximity to a bunch of stuff _if_ the streets were designed right.

"My understanding is that it goes to the statehouse with just a 4-3 vote, as it has in the past. But Donato will say it doesn't have strong support, so it will die on the table, as it has in the past.

The burden to get 15% of the registered voters on a petition is way too high. Knight, Scarpelli, and Caraviello haven't got 15% of the registered voters to vote for them in the last three elections. Knight cited the CPA as an example of people getting things done by petition to get it on the ballot, but that requirement is just 5% of registered voters.

It's beyond ridiculous. I do wonder if there could be a nonbinding measure put on the ballot to put some pressure on the councilors and state leadership. It would be hard to say it doesn't have broad support if a nonbinding measure passed 70/30 or 80/20. I don't know, but my guess is getting non-binding measure on the ballot would take a similar number of signatures to the CPA.

"Yeah and you're suggesting we add, what, a few hundred jobs? Where are the workers going to live who work those jobs? Not everyone in this area is already in life sciences, so by default you're going to add demand to the local housing market. Sure, some folks might commute from far away but most folks are going to want to be somewhat close to their jobs.

So we get cheaper property taxes, at the expense of housing prices continuing to rise. Those who can afford that benefit. Lots of people will be priced out and replaced by life sciences engineers. Seems like a win lose to me. Some winners, maybe like yourself, and quite a few losers who get pushed further away.

"Honestly need more of them along Mystic Ave. That area is perfect:

* Mostly strip mall developments, so it's already a commercial zone and perfect for ground floor level retail
* GLX is maybe a mile away, so some folks may choose to walk/bike there. Add some crosswalks to Mystic Ave and suddenly it's fairly easy walk (maybe Main St is tricky, but there's crosswalks at lights already and could use some more flashing style ones too)
* i93 is right there, so add a bit of parking and some folks might live there for a reverse commute situation
* Wegmans isn't too far away, Medford Sq and Main St are close by too, so possible to get some walking/biking traffic mixed in with a modest amount of car traffic. If the existing bus lines were better, you might even negate any traffic increase with folks using transit
* Very few houses there already, so it's not displacing anyone like a flip/condo conversion would
* We need housing in the area, and luxury stuff is all that's profitable, so might as well build some more for the high earners
* And if Medford is smart, require 10-20% of the units be market rate or ""affordable"", so we even get some ""affordable"" housing stock added

Boston proper needs a ton of new housing - something like 50k or 60k new units last I checked over the next 10 years. Medford likely needs to add some too to keep up with demand and stabilize the housing market a bit. You could mix in some commercial space too and retail space to balance the tax base and provide a nice live - work - shop type area which is pretty good development generally.",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1647977835.0,0,t1_i1p9hw1,i1p9hw1,False,alcesAlcesShirasi,t3_tk280b,https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/tk280b/the_ford_tavern_to_open_in_medford/,The Ford Tavern to Open in Medford,/r/medfordma/comments/tk280b/the_ford_tavern_to_open_in_medford/i1p9hw1/,6,r/medfordma,0,6

"You sound confused.  I'll put aside your needlessly offensive tone and briefly explain.  Changes to the law do change the behaviors of humans, although lack of enforcement do mitigate that effect.  Changes to the structure of a roadway do make them safer.  Law is a technology like any other and when engineering a solution like this, one must take into account both the law and the physical world and balance that solution with the needs and secondary or tertiary effects that solution causes.

The above poster seemed to ignore any concept of the law in the discussion.  This causes issues.  When society doesn't care about a law, doesn't enforce it, or doesn't think it exists, it leads to that law being broken in the future compounding the problem.  Social science has proven this.

If we have a crosswalk we should assume cars will stop, and if we have a road without a cross walk we should assume people will walk to the nearest crosswalk before crossing.  I think it's hyperbolic to say cars will never stop at a non-signaled crosswalk.  Most people obey the law.

I think your comment is less about the dangerousness of increasing the amount of lanes in a road and more about the possible lack of enforcement by the police in this area and Massachusetts.

"Rt. 16 used to be two lanes in this section and was reduced to single lane some ~25 years ago. (Before my time in Medford.) 

I would not be in favor of widening the road. There's always traffic but it moves quickly and keeps the noise down. It's a parkway, not a highway, and saving a 1-2 minutes in a car shouldn't be the goal.

"On top of this there's a group advocating for a road diet on most of Alewife Brook Parkway and Mystic Valley Parkway because of the number of crashes along it and how unfriendly these roadways are to pedestrians. It's an offshoot of the [SASS](https://www.sass-somerville.org/) if you're curious. I've checked out a few of their meetings but haven't had the time to attend lately.

The OP is mad because they're stuck in traffic, but the flip side is if someone lives across the street from this roadway and wants to cross it to make use of our wonderful park land, they may need to cross 4 lanes of traffic vs 2. This increases the danger of the crossing:

* more lanes to cross, so more distance to cover. Granny can't easily cross 4 lanes (might be a 50 foot walk) but 2 lanes might be easier for her. Same with families with stroller or kid in tow, same for cyclists walking their bike (or illegally biking it, which should really be legal, but that's a whole other discussion), etc
* more cars using the roadway because now 4 lanes so 4 cars need to see the traffic signal and stop.
* induced demand means more cars in general too

We've moved away from these stroad like designs that the OP wants. In all parts of Boston people are advocating and mostly successfully I must add, for road diets. We've realized the old 1950's way of building roads doesn't work. We increase traffic and decrease walkability. What's the point? If you're going to be stuck in traffic regardless, we might as well make it nicer for the people _who actually live there_ to enjoy their neighborhoods.

There was a quorum. I think my preference would have been for Morell to put this information out ahead of time. I'm not sure if any residents did speak on the issue.

Basically, the Charter Review reviews the rules of how the city is governed. The last time it was reviewed was the 1980s, so lo these many decades later...it's good to look at the rules of the city from a modern perspective (e.g., we currently have a mayor vs. a town manager and 7 city councilors who are elected at large but no ward representation). No one is really campaigning to make changes to the charter, just to open the process to review it. It needs strong support of the residents, City Council (last vote in 2021 was 4-3 in favor), the Mayor (she supports it), and the elected officials (they all support it, including Donato). Getting resident support has been difficult because it's a pretty dry topic that involves the mechanics of the city and people have to work really hard to get a serious percentage of residents to sign the petition.",t2_fkyxk,b0xturtl3,0,1646056388.0,0,t1_hys01pv,hys01pv,False,b0xturtl3,t3_t3esqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/t3esqm/sign_this_letter_of_support_to_start_the_charter/,Sign this letter of support to start the charter review process in Medford,/r/medfordma/comments/t3esqm/sign_this_letter_of_support_to_start_the_charter/hys01pv/,11,r/medfordma,0,11

We are a diversified group of residents from across the city, representing a broad range of economic levels and political affiliations. Centrists, progressives, and conservatives alike are among us. We all strongly believe that a City Charter requires periodic review. 
The home rule petition currently before you proposes a nine-member charter review commission to be elected by the voters of Medford. Language was added to the home rule petition in response to feedback from city council members concerned about representative equity on the commission.

The approval of this bill does not change the makeup of representation on the city council but opens the door to approval from the state to begin the process of electing a commission to review the charter.
 
 - Ward representation of the commission was written into the paper to reflect City Council members‚Äô concerns about representative equity.  
 - The language of the home rule petition has been reviewed by legal counsel and there is no doubt that it is fully compliant with Massachusetts legislative procedure.
 
The residents of Medford deserve and want charter review. We urge you to move to vote on this petition at your regular meeting immediately following the Committee of the Whole meeting, and to send this petition to the state house with a 7-0 vote. 

Every City has the right to a review!",t2_fkyxk,b0xturtl3,0,1646052423.0,0,t1_hyrspy6,hyrspy6,True,b0xturtl3,t3_t3esqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/t3esqm/sign_this_letter_of_support_to_start_the_charter/,Sign this letter of support to start the charter review process in Medford,/r/medfordma/comments/t3esqm/sign_this_letter_of_support_to_start_the_charter/hyrspy6/,4,r/medfordma,0,4

"FYI, 2/22/22 e-mail:

Hello, this is the City of Medford with an update about parking operations.

Medford‚Äôs new Parking Department officially launched last month and has been working to fully transition all operations from ParkMedford.

Beginning on Monday, February 28th, all parking permits, payments, and requests can officially be conducted online by visiting www.medfordma.org/parking. At this time, no parking regulations have changed, and cost of permits remain the same.

Also beginning on February 28th, Parking Control Specialists will enforce parking-related violations on all public streets in Medford. For the first two weeks they will give only ‚Äúwarning‚Äù violations to allow residents, businesses and visitors to adjust to the new enforcement activities citywide. During the two week warning period, fines will still be issued for any public safety violation such as blocking a fire hydrant, parking in a handicap parking zone without a proper permit, or parking in front of a handicap ramp. For a full list of violations that will be enforced by the Parking Department, visit www.medfordma.org/parking.

The Parking Department is also launching a new pay-by-phone option for parking at metered spots throughout the city. The ‚ÄúPayByPhone‚Äù app is available for download in the Apple Store or Google Play. More information, including how-to videos, are available on the Parking Department website.

We will send a reminder communication before March 14th, when the warning period will end and parking fines will be issused. For more information and details about the Medford Parking Department and operations, visit www.medfordma.org/parking, or call 781-393-2501.",t2_2ys9xxex,luckofathousandstars,0,1645680847.0,0,t1_hy7cxsm,hy7cxsm,True,oliverollie07,t3_t01t3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/t01t3z/going_to_a_show_at_chevalier_theatre_on_friday/,Going to a show at Chevalier Theatre on Friday.

"There's a systemic asymmetry. 

If someone in a neighborhood is annoyed with a pizza place being open, then that disgruntled neighbor will march down to City Council to give them an earful.

Meanwhile, people sad about a lack of late night pizza option don't really go complain about that to City Council. They just assume that's the way it is. 

And so over time, the city council gets it in their head that ""the community"" needs them to really scrutinize proposals to be super sure they do not cause problems.

"They did not, but let me give you the context of how it happened.

Councillor Knight suggested that he thinks that traffic to the pizza parlor at night could be disruptive to the neighborhood. He suggested, therefore, that it be delivery-only after 11 p.m. (except Friday and Saturday nights) until the 90-day review, after which point he thinks the Council should consider allowing the business to stay fully open till 2. 

So Councillor Scarpelli, who heads up the licensing committee and generally coordinates and communicates with the business owners, asked the business owner if that is workable for him, and the business owner said that would work. The clerk recorded that as a condition on the permit, and the Council approved the permit unanimously. 

So here's the deal. None of the other councillors ever expressed an opinion about the issue, they simply went along with Knight's concern since the business owner was OK with Knight's compromise. There wasn't any debate. And this is reasonable, since remember, the Councillors are colleagues who want to be respectful of one another and take each other's concerns seriously.

Now, I disagree with Knight's concern and his remedy. I think we should want more businesses open late at night for various reasons! 

If we email, it's very likely the issue will at least be more fully discussed next time, and maybe all 6 of the councillors who *didn't* voice any concerns might vote to support!

Also, it's possible that Councillor Knight might change his mind once he hears from constituents that late-night food options are important to them! :D

So my suggestion is to avoid the doomerism and send an email!! It could make a difference and move us on a path more like what you want to see! <3",t2_6in1ghk0,which1umean,0,1645585702.0,0,t1_hy1xm6b,hy1xm6b,False,[deleted],t3_sz3ca3,https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/sz3ca3/medford_city_council_puts_restrictions_on/,Medford City Council puts restrictions on proposed late-night pizza spot in Haines Sq,/r/medfordma/comments/sz3ca3/medford_city_council_puts_restrictions_on/hy1xm6b/,12,r/medfordma,0,12

"Union includes:

* Treasurer's department - the budget has a ""Treasurer"" with a salary of $104,605, a Dep. Collector with a salary of $75,971 that was eliminated in 2022, and a ""Asst. Treasurer"" with a salary of $69,660. The city's [website](https://www.medfordma.org/departments/collector/) has a ""Treasurer/Collector"" and an ""Assistant Treasurer/Collector"". So, they seemingly have taken on the collector's role (and they each took a $10-15k pay cut in 2022, at least by their budgeted positions. A payroll director position was added to the department for the 2022 budget, but they don't appear on the treasurer's city page or in the article's list of unionized positions.
   * Treasurer Collector
   * Assistant Treasurer Collector
* Co-Directors of the Consumer Advisory Commission - who all retired, and are paid by Attorney General's office?, and who filed an ageism complaint in August. The [budget](https://city-medford-ma-budget-book.cleargov.com/city-of-medford-fy2022-municipal-budget/2022/departments/consumer-advisory-commission) item for ""Consumer Advisory Board Employees"" was $10,000, ""Primarily due to the cut in consumers grant funding.""
* Building Commissioner - salary of $109,950
* Director of Traffic and Transportation - we know we have a director of traffic and transportation, and he's listed on the city's website, but I can't find a line item in the budget. It seemingly should be under DPW/Engineering division based on the [org chart](https://city-medford-ma-budget-book.cleargov.com/city-of-medford-fy2022-municipal-budget/2022/departments/department-of-public-works-dpw), but I can't find it .
* IT Director - who was asked to resign or be fired. Official budgeted position is ""Data Processing Director"", salary $109,950
* Network Administrator - $61,636 salary
* City Clerk - whose elections process the mayor's office recommended a 3rd party audit. Salary $105,620
* Assistant City Clerk - see above, salary $68,375. 
* Chief Assessor- Salary $118,720
* Assistant Assessor - Salary $76,987
* City Engineer (salary $134,541) - who is now serving as the acting DPW commissioner (salary $140,817) because the mayor asked that person to resign
* Assistant City Engineer - most likely this is the ""Engineers"" position under the City engineer, in which case there are 2 spots for $202,473, or $101,237 per.
* Election Coordinator - see above about 3rd party audit of elections process. This position is new for FY22 and has a salary of $63,544
* Senior Sanitarian - It's not clear that there is a ""senior"" sanitarian in the [budget](https://city-medford-ma-budget-book.cleargov.com/city-of-medford-fy2022-municipal-budget/2022/departments/health). There is one line item for three sanitarians, with a total of $223,587 and average of $74,529
* Assistant Finance Director - Salary of $72,411, a $7,662 paycut in FY22. There is no sitting Finance Director because she resigned last June, charging a hostile workplace. 
* Veterans Services Director - Salary $76,011. Determined there was stipend money paid to someone who was no longer doing the job, disagreed and protested against some of the mayor's policies, was then asked to undergo a mental fitness test, missing weeks of work because the mayor did not set an appointment immediately, passed the test (as well as one he had done separately), and is now asking to be part of a regionalization of Veteran's Services with Wilmington

"So if:

Of course, this assumes that every household neatly falls into a ""retiree"" or ""non-retiree"" bucket, and that a retiree's income is 0. Some seniors might still be earning an income, and I don't know how social security, or disbursements from a retirement account are taken into account for that number.

Fearmonger much? The property taxes on a $2900/month rental are about $2900/year. So even a massive 10% override would translate to an extra $25 dollars a month. Barely even noticable compared to the MASSIVE rent increases. Currently no override is proposed and it would take years to go into effect and require consent of voters.

"Historically, 3-5% might be expected.  But housing inflation is completely nuts all over right now.  Apartment rents in Boston rose around 10% from 2020-2021.   The surrounding cities and towns are getting hit even harder than Boston proper due to people being pushed farther out.  The cost of buying a house or apartment in MA has risen 27% over the last two years, pushing more people to stay renters.  
  
Basically, if you don‚Äôt already own property, it‚Äôs a bad time.  It doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask the property management company what to expect.  Looking at real estate sites to see what your building is advertising vacant units for might give you a good idea.  Also, you can definitely find two bedrooms in Medford cheaper than you‚Äôre paying if you‚Äôre not attached to living in a luxury building.

"Based on what I've seen on the /r/boston sub in posts like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/s8xyki/landlord_gave_a_friend_and_her_mother_a_1_month/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/s2g7rq/whats_your_rent_increase_looking_like_sane_or/) and recently on the /r/CambridgeMA sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CambridgeMA/comments/sjuz6b/rent_renewal_negotiation/)... anywhere from a few hundred to potentially $800.

I agree with /u/External_Dimension71 though, the best way to find out is to ask. Though it may be too early to know for certain on a Sept lease, so you may get a ball park answer at least. You may also find it helpful to ask neighbors. Maybe some are on different leases and have already been notified of the increase (if any - though I'd wager there _is_ going to be an increase in a luxury building). You should also browse the competition and see what your size apartment goes for in other buildings. If you see numbers significantly higher than what you're paying... there's going to be a significant increase. If things are similar, maybe not as big of an increase. Your building will likely follow what the market rate is. They shouldn't raise your rent that much in an ideal world, but with there being little protections around rent increases you may be in for a shocker.

This apparently offended him because he yelled back:

UPS: ""what the fuck is your problem?""

ME: ""Uhh... I just said excuse me... I'm trying to get my coffee and you're blocking the pickups"".

UPS: ""What, did you think I wasn't going to move?""

ME: ""Well I was here about a minute and you weren't moving.... I was just trying to be polite"".

UPS: ""You're a fucking asshole"".

Me: ""What... I literally just said excuse me... whatever"". -- I go out the door at this point, and he follows me.

UPS: ""What's your fucking problem asshole?""

ME: ""My problem? My problem is I literally just said excuse me and you flew off the handle, who is the asshole in this situation? You're the fucking asshole dude and you're the problem. I was just trying to be nice.""

UPS: ""Oh I'm the asshole? Why don't you fucking come over here and say that. I will fuck you up!""

Me: ""For real? If I wasn't on my way to a meeting right now I would, but I need to go and you need to chill out.""

UPS: ""Oh yeah, where do you work?"" he then tried to look at my ID badge on my waist.

Me: ""Fuck you.""

UPS: "" Fuck you!""

"My other takeaways:

* Transcript is adopting ""Our Revolution"" vs. ""old guard"" descriptions  of the makeup of the council. 25 months ago, Knight was the 2nd youngest on the council, just two years or so older than the now-mayor, and has kids in either kindergarten or first grade, hardly someone who likely thinks of himself as ""old-guard,"" but here we are.
* I think it's relevant that the new federal funds manager was campaign staff for all nine of the Our Revolution electees; I think the Transcript should mention it.
* No mention of the vacant/interim situation of Water and Sewer superintendent. I'm curious if that resulted from some sort of transgression as well (the job posting was made at the same time as the DPW commissioner's).
* In asking for a $5k bump for pay of the Director of Finance, the chief of staff suggested that it is hard to get candidates for the job because unlike private businesses, we have to do background checks and CORI's.

Somerville defines it as two feet as you said:

> ARTICLE V

> STOPPING, STANDING, PARKING

> Section 5-1 General Prohibitions
> No driver shall allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered in his name to stand or park in any street, way, highway, road or parkway under the control of the City of Somerville in violation of any of the Traffic Regulations adopted by the Traffic Commission and in particular in any of the following places except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with the direction of a police officer or traffic sign or signal.

> (i) In front of any driveway, including 2 feet in either direction from the driveway

(page 16)

It's possible that the (new as of this year) Medford Parking department will better define this. There's some contact info listed on this new website page: https://www.medfordma.org/parking/

> In the letter, the city demands the members confirm their status and their exposures, citing CDC guidelines that they must have been within 6 feet of the associate for 15 minutes or more to be counted as close contacts. **The mayor postulates she had learned the contact occurred at an outside event over the weekend.**

It sounds like the Mayor questions their ""exposure"", though I'm not sure why she/her admin thought it would be a good idea to call them out publicly in a letter. So I'm with you on ""why not let this play itself out"" since it's not the best optics wise. Plus, the article goes on to mention details like 4 of the employees claiming to be COVID+. If that's true, then it really doesn't matter if their exposure was made up, they're COVID+ regardless assuming they have test results and followed whatever policies the DPW has.

Though it also goes on to say things like:

> In the letter, signed by Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian, she states: ‚ÄúAdditionally, upon information and belief, *be advised that the City understands that Park‚Äôs Division personnel have been instructed to represent themselves as being a Close Contact for purposes of avoiding having to report for duty for the upcoming storm.*‚Äù

> ""If this allegation is true, it would constitute a work-stoppage which is in violation of the negotiated collective bargaining agreement.

"No one's asking for magic. I just think overly large and complex designs usually come from trying to give cars the maximum space and options. Like giving cars 3 straight lanes, plus 2 turning lanes, plus 1 protected turn lane, plus an elevated crossover, etc, etc. All to eliminate places where cars might have to stop while making it a thousand times harder for bikes and pedestrians to cross.

I think it's well past time we stopped trying to prioritize cars at every intersection. Give them fewer lanes and direct access to every potential direction out of the intersection. If they need to make more stops, or go a longer way around to get somewhere, then so be it.

I noticed during the holiday shopping period, the police shutdown some lanes and portions of the circle near gateway center. Cars wanting to go in certain directions had to go way around different ways and it *drastically* improved traffic flow through that area.

"Wellington circle sucks for cars, bikes & pedestrians. Try crossing from station landing over to cvs sometime and see what a nightmare it is (by any mode!). The new striping helped a tiny bit, but mostly for cars.

I agree that the overpass would be awful, even though it does represent the ""simplest"" layout.  I like the concepts around splitting it into multiple intersections (the quadrant/triangle concepts near the bottom).  There's similar plans for [Sullivan Square](https://mass.streetsblog.org/2021/06/24/boston-massdot-reveal-plans-to-reconfigure-sullivan-square-by-2026/) and I know when they presented them a few years ago I generally liked it.

Simplifying it so there's less cross walks to worry about for everyone (no one wants to hit a pedestrian in a car, nor do you want to get hit while on foot) and an easier intersection to navigate for all would be nice.

If it were somehow feasible too, an under pass would be kinda cool - could greatly simplify the intersection for pedestrians/cyclists if the majority of car traffic could just go underground.

"Thank you for your very detailed reply, it really helps to understand better. My main priority to learn martial arts is self-defense and feel confident in the event of any unavoidable physical confrontations. So any gym where there is sparring practice or practical applications of martial arts would be nice. Roshankish seems to be ideal to learn sparring from the start. I will check on their prices. The reviews on google are very positive and someone had mentioned the price being on the expensive side. I will need to check it out. In my experience with trial classes it was more of cardio and prettier form than actual self defense and so gyms like Roshankish would be nice to apply techniques in practice.

"You are going to have a hard time finding a gym for that price per month. When I first started looking around, I saw most places where in the $150 to $200 range. 

If you want to learn muay thai and compete, Sityodtong Muay Thai Academy is probably your best bet. They have a really amazing training program, but I have heard the coaches are very demanding. I believe the cost when I looked was around $200 per month. Hard Knocks Muay Thai and MMA in Everett is also decent and cheaper, from what I remember, but still probably around $120 to $150. I've seen both gyms compete and their fighters are excellent.

If your goal is less about an art and more about self defense, Roshankish on main street is your best bet. You will learn how to use techniques from different martial arts to defend yourself. There is not a focus on one specific art, on winning points, or on perfect technique like there might be for muay thai gyms. The 6PM class is usually 10 to 15 min of cardio conditioning, 20 to 30 minutes of learning a technique and its variations, then the remaining time is spent sparring. You spar from the start, which is different than many gyms. The 7pm classes were grappling M/W and striking T/Th. The saturday 9:30AM class is usually MMA focused. The 10:30AM class is usually grappling or an hour of sparring. 

I looked into other martial arts, like Xtreme Ninja, Title 9 Boxing, and the like. They are more for weightloss or cardio workouts than self defense or learning a martial art, imo. 

You could also look into BJJ. There are some great gyms in the area, like Mau Mau. I, personally, don't like learning just BJJ because I'm more interested in self-defense, which requires both stand up and ground work. However, BJJ is a wonderful martial art and a lot of fun.",t2_5fjfr9i9,Suitable-Biscotti,0,1640980162.0,0,t1_hqpwxy3,hqpwxy3,True,lakukilukum,t3_rsyyix,https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/rsyyix/recommendations_for_martial_arts_classes_in_or/,Recommendations for Martial arts classes in or near Medford MA,/r/medfordma/comments/rsyyix/recommendations_for_martial_arts_classes_in_or/hqpwxy3/,6,r/medfordma,0,6

"There are a few openings on these boards. If you go to the city's website ([https://www.medfordma.org/boards/](https://www.medfordma.org/boards/)), however, you'll see a list of 29 boards, with many people whose status on them appears as expired. That is probably mostly a lack of updating the website diligently, but some of these dates are 2015! You would also expect to be able to go to those boards' web pages and see updated agendas and minutes from their meetings, but in at least 20 cases, you won't be able to do so. I poked around on each page. In some cases I had to poke around pretty hard to find something, and in others it was much simpler.

So if you sign up for one of these boards, suggest some improvements to recordkeeping!

"Because nobody wants to live among low-income, low-skill, low-ability, low-ambition neighbors. Bad decision making follows with bad outcomes and bleak prospects. Thats why.   Not all people are ""car-dependent"" - for many - its a capital asset that increases your ability to compete for new jobs, or replace a job that has gone away. It's a matter of knowing how to balance the fixed costs of owning a car against the incremental income increasing opportunities that exist beyond the 101 Bus.  Think Raytheon over Starbucks,  think Oracle in Burlington over Target, think working in the Sea Port over working at Dunks on Salem Street.

"25 years ago, buying a car and moving to Medford was what transformed me from making $75K/yr to $125K/yr.  While I lived in Medford, my job assignments were in Burlington, Waltham, Cambridge and later - Logan Long Term Parking.  The car is a tool to get to a job that you compete with based on your resume and your resume is something you constantly nurture and grown. Now, in 2021, I make 2x what I made 25 years ago, but I work from home due to the Pandemic. Nonetheless, the car is a capital asset that is used to get to a job. Denying Medford residents this option in order favour the unskilled and unambitious is - frankly - economic harikiri.

The Smart Money will always want to own a car - to gain the competitive job reach that you can't get with public transit. The Smart Money will always choose to live in a Low-Rent City but work in a High-Salary locale - and exploiting the margin between fixed low cost of living and high income to make prudent investments with returns that exceed that of owning real estate in Low-Rent areas. 

Have fun trying to ""punish"" car owners. We'll move. We'll starve your local businesses of our discretionary income. We'll make optimal risk-opportunity choices as to where we live to maximize our ability to save and invest - and that means moving out, and moving to places that are more amenable to the ""middle class"" lifestyle we are seeking.

You can drown in your ""car-less"" dream of hyper-dense slum housing in Medford if enough of you decide to convince Medford City Council otherwise.

Of course, South St also goes north and east from that intersection in the other direction. But maybe that section of the street came later.

[https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/ids:2640138](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/ids:2640138)

1855 (Medford): There is no Winthrop St north of the river. South St includes what is currently South St, but also what is currently Winthrop St. south of the River. No North or West Streets, yet.

[https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/ids:2569375](https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/ids:2569375)

1875 (Medford) -  Still no Winthrop St south of the Mystic. West St. is now named, and going west from South St. and as /u/Squidbertz mentioned, includes what is now North St, so West St in Medford continued (going in a southerly direction. parallel to South St) to North St. in Somerville. There is no North St in Medford.

[https://wardmapsgifts.com/products/medford-center-massachusetts-1875](https://wardmapsgifts.com/products/medford-center-massachusetts-1875)

1880 - Winthrop St. now exists, and crosses the river meeting South St, but South St. retains the name

"I'm not Jewish and (despite being married to a Jew for a few years) I don't have any sort of reasonable understanding of exactly how offensive this display was. That said, I'm trying to understand why so many people are refusing to even consider that this was an innocent (if stupid) mistake. Assuming the explanation of the person responsible is correct, they DID ask a Jewish person who pointed them to a web page whereupon the individual responsible downloaded the wrong image. Should they have confirmed the image with someone Jewish first? Sure - but they thought they'd already done their due diligence. 

It's a terrible mistake and no doubt offensive, but as someone who's attended multiple Hanukkah celebrations and Passover Seders as well as temple a few times, I wouldn't have noticed anything wrong with that graphic at first glance. So why is the Jewish community demanding the heads of the people responsible? Isn't this a teachable moment?

I'm not the mayor, but if I was I'd go beyond the apology and offer to create a new volunteer Judaic Relations council that would meet bi-monthly to discuss Jewish representation for the municipality. How many of the people complaining would be willing to volunteer their time to be on that council?

"No, I think you're spot on. Yes, there are some just weird things that I wouldn't expect many to catch, like the wrong number of candles, the strange names of holidays and that they are paired with the candles for some reason, etc. But then there are other items, like what you  mentioned, that should immediately raise an eyebrow if you have even a passing familiarity with Western religious cultures.

I had originally expected this to be somewhat overblown before I saw the actual picture, and I'm pretty inured to casual antisemitism mostly arising out of ignorance as a Jew having grown up in the rural midwest, but that a municipal government used this image in an attempt of ""cultural sharing"" is some pretty shocking incompetence.

"Really?

The cross is pretty famously a Christian thing and not a Jewish thing. Same with resurrection, it's kind of an important thing Jesus did.

And it would be wild for part of the menorah to be about atoning for Israel. Most Jews feel that Israel is their religious and cultural home that they don't have to apologize for. It would be especially weird to ascribe that meaning to a symbol from an event that happened over 2 thousand years ago.

"Fwiw, she got help from the Interfaith Clergy Group on the apology (from FB):

""Beloved - as president of the Interfaith Clergy Group, I am sorry I was not aware of this terrible situation until midday today. Rabbi Braham David and I were in communication with the Mayor (as was Rabbi Abramson) this mid-day and were explicit with her about the error and terror that this anti-semitic image represents; about the failure to seek guidance and lived experience from Jewish members of our community when seeking to include their experience; about appropriation and the (frankly sick) twisting of a Jewish symbol by Christian intention; and about the need for this primarily white, Christian, hetero, cis-gendered, and privileged administration to seek help ahead of time when trying to include. The Mayor is remorseful and she and the staff are ready to learn and have issued a public apology (for which they received guidance from the same interfaith leaders as noted above). I know the intentions were to include and that the results were harmful.
And, there is another huge lesson in this moment for all of us who hold dominant status in the broken system of our culture. There is so much that our eyes cannot see because of the lenses we wear, so we MUST include the vision of others. I pray (and believe) that we will continue to learn if we teach each other. When we know better we will do better.

""Hi Michael,  
My name is Lisa Colaianni and I work in the Medford Mayor‚Äôs office. It was my idea to put the descriptions in the frames. I‚Äôm so sorry to have offended you or anyone else; that was never my intention!  
A few weeks ago, when planning began for the Holiday event held last night, I was brainstorming and thought that there are people in the community who would be interested in learning about holiday symbols which would be the Menorah, the Christmas tree and the Kwanzaa candles. I enjoyed my research and reading about the symbolism and found it interesting as I often do when learning about religions outside of my own.  
When thinking about what we could do to enlighten others on the holiday symbolisms, I called upon someone of the Jewish faith and she sent me a link she thought would be good to use.  
I apologize for offending anyone; it‚Äôs the last thing I would ever do intentionally.  
Tomorrow morning, I will remove the frames when I get to City Hall.  
If there is something you‚Äôd like to see as a fitting replacement, please let me know; I would be happy to do it.  
Thank you for your time.  
Sincerely,  
Lisa""

"A specific gap in what?

Violence is down across the board. Medford High, as my parents tell it, used to have way more 40-50 years back - especially with some racial tension. Kids used to beat the shit out of each other for being from another neighborhood, which was a few streets over depending. But the more things decrease, the harder we take individual acts. It's hard to think, ""well things are okay overall, so don't worry"".

Nothing ""allows"" it to happen, but what do you expect? Something tangible, ideally, but what is it short of a chip from science fiction that could prevent all crime?",t2_htiik,pillbinge,0,1638501642.0,0,t1_hn0t232,hn0t232,False,Individual-0001,t3_r78cnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/r78cnw/medford_high_school_students_walk_out_after/,Medford High School Students Walk Out After Incidents Of Violence,/r/medfordma/comments/r78cnw/medford_high_school_students_walk_out_after/hn0t232/,4,r/medfordma,0,4
"NP. Welcome to Medford, even if you got a big ol' _FUCK YOU TOWED YAH CARH_ greeting.

Highly recommend following multiple pages for Medford alerts. There's [a parking meeting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/medfordma/comments/r78pl2/128_medford_sets_first_public_meeting_on_parking/) next week for example you may want to tune into if you own a car, or are concerned about parking policies. I'm on the alerts, signed up for the newsletter, but I only noticed this meeting in a random pedestrian/cycling Facebook group. I see it's been linked to on this sub too, but damn, you kinda have to follow a few pages to keep up to date with wtf is going on in this City. Camberville does this _so much fucking better_, just like how they don't do stupid shit like parking restrictions _by street_, or collecting recycling every two weeks, or outsourcing their parking permits to a third party company (this finally ends next year!), or contracting out plowing (just wait til you see how badly Medford plows after snow storms!!), or any other stupid shit that I've forgotten to mention.

(/s)

Serious answer: this happens twice a year, spring & fall. Medford is wacky with everything they do compared to Camberville, so street sweeping only happens weekly on the main streets but they do a twice a year _BIG SWEEP_ in the spring & fall. You'll want to keep an eye on this sub, [the Medford MA city website](https://www.medfordma.org/), [Medford Alerts](https://www.medfordma.org/alerts/), [the Medford Newsletter](https://www.medfordma.org/2021/03/15/city-launches-new-bi-weekly-e-newsletter/), [the Medford MA Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MedfordMAofficial), and finally [the Street Sweeping page](http://www.medfordma.org/street-sweeping/). Follow/subscribe to at least a few of these pages and you should catch the alerts.
