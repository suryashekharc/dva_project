"I’m not sure of where would work out for you because my understanding is that it’s not about motor size. It’s about the type of vehicle. I believe you’re looking at a Vespa type scooter or a motorized bicycle as I don’t believe we have mopeds available for rent anywhere. Last time I checked you didn’t have to have a license for a trike but that was way back, check current laws. 

Be sure to keep the weather in mind. In a few weeks locals start putting their bikes away for the season. Unless you’re a morning person it’s way too hot to wear the appropriate safety gear and enjoy. I wear a leather jacket, jeans and boots and once we hit 85 it’s gods awful and not worth it to me. 

Even a day trip started early that bring you back down the mountain after noon can leave you dazed, not fully clear headed. It’s not safe to ride that way especially a California mountain. We’ve stayed and killed time in the area we where in just to be sure everyone was able to ride safely out of the heat of the day. The heat is not something to play with. 

Off roading is different. No lights to have to stop at and bake under the sun really makes a difference. We pour straight ice water over our heads, throw a helmet back on and go out again, but that’s not for everyone.  

Also in our area drivers could care less about a bike on the road and the heat makes people mean. If you do get to ride be very careful. 74 is very tempting but I’ve lost fiends and a cousin on bikes to that ride. As a tourist you’re not as used to our mountain roads. It’s not an easy ride for weekend/monthly rides.

"Hi OP. I don't know that it will be the dynamic social scene you're looking for, but I'd still recommend that you give it a try. 

I moved a lot in my 20s and even if it doesn't turn out to be a permanent thing, it's a new experience. I learned a lot in my moves. A lot about CA in general is very different than the Midwest or East Coast (I grew up in PA and OH) so it's interesting to get to experience that. 

LQ has a mix of some families and young people, and you'll be a short drive from Palm Springs - which has somewhat of a younger scene in spots, although a big chunk of that is tourism.  Living rent free may also allow you a chance to explore some of the more expensive coastal cities (San Diego, LA, Long Beach) where you might be able to transition to a more permanent job, etc. 

You may be able to get an HR gig though for an in person job you'd likely be looking at a hospitality job. Unless you can do some work remotely, or if you'd be willing to do a bit of a commute outside of the area.

"I saw some of your other posts about your job/internship and where it is (Beaumont).

Honestly you may have an easier time finding a summer rental there, or heading a bit farther west (towards Redlands) or south from there (Riverside) than here. We have people who work here year round that are living that far out to find a rental.

Traditional rental situations of *any* kind aren't nonexistent but they do tend to be rare here, because so much of Palm Springs itself is vacation rentals. We've also had a huge influx of people from cities like LA and SF due to COVID so the pickings are extremely slim.

The fact that it's summer MIGHT help you if you're set on a Palm Springs rental. You may find someone who wants to get out of Hell's Front Porch for the summer and will sublease to you. Or someone who needs a roommate.

JohnR's list below is a good one - availability and affordability would go up the farther east/southeast you'd go on that list (LaQuinta, etc.) however - that would add substantial time to your commute.

Think about how important being in Palm Springs is - it's got some great aspects, of course. But in the heat of summer I don't know how much you'll really get a feel of a community. It might be better to live closer to work and come do stuff here on the weekends. Anyway, good look, housing market is beyond bizarro these days.

"As a minimum buy a summer Tram pass, annual pass is a better deal. On hot days, it's 40 degrees cooler after a 10 minute ride up. Either hike, or bring a book and a cooler of wine and food and just chill. You can bring your own stuff so long as you don't eat/ drink inside the arrival station/ restaurant/ bar.

Cities:

Palm Springs-Very gay friendly, LA Hipsters at hotels, touristy downtown, great mountain views, good bars and restaurants, semi-expensive for the desert

Cathedral City- Where the less affluent gays live and a good portion of the workforce. Affordable option for many if you want to be in the west valley

Rancho Mirage-Keeping the workforce out of the city since 1975. I keed, I keed! The olds and trumpers live here. Affluent area and can be expensive for the desert.

Palm Desert-The middle city. Younger residents. A mall, El Paseo (""the Rodeo Drive of the desert""), Fresh Agave margaritas. A city to complain that La Quinta and Palm Springs are too far to drive. Moderate affordability for the desert

Indian Wells-Highest per capita income. Probably the oldest people, as well. Generally considered the most affluent and expensive area. I wouldn't want to live here. Boring. A couple of nice hotels, a tennis garden and the IW Club.

La Quinta-This is an opportunity to live with probably the youngest people. La Quinta is a mixed bag of very high end country clubs and home to the La Quinta Cove. The La Quinta Cove is generally affordable and has fantastic views of the mountains. The ""Cove"" can be sketch AF at times and any crime in the city will most likely be here. North (of Washington) La Quinta has a middle income suburban feel, but is bland compared to the cove.

Indio-La Quinta is bleeding over into Indio and has a few nice country clubs, but the residential areas are pretty suspect in many places. A large part of the hospitality workforce for the east valley largely live here.

Coachella-Native and generational residents live here.

Desert Hot Springs-Meth capital of the world. I keed, I keed again! Well sort of.  The meth capital of the world is about to be overtaken by the weed storage capital of the world. This is an area many are looking to right now because of its affordability. It's on the windy side of the 10, but that will be the least of your problems living here",t2_8hs26hne,atxJohnR,0,1648465994.0,0,t1_i2faho2,i2faho2,True,Puzzleheaded_Gap4002,t3_tq17qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/tq17qn/im_considering_moving_here_for_the_summer_seems/,I’m considering moving here for the summer?

Yes. It gets worse the closer to the venue. Even palm springs because some hotels will host pool parties. All I could think of are the small inns since most people will keep to themselves.

"I’ve lived in Palm Springs for the last three months having lived in Washington state most of my life.  

Things I like:
45-55 mph on city streets.
Lush gardens 
Cops seem cool 
Couldn’t ask for better winter weather
1:45 to Laguna if you crave ocean. Also, close mountains, Joshua Tree, etc.
Seems like the desert cities have a lot of big city attractions like big name tennis and golf tournaments, mid-tier and up entertainers, and festivals.
50+ crowd seems agile and spry compared to other places.  This weather seems good for longevity.
Things I don’t care for:
Short turn lanes make for long waits at lights if you’re going left during rush hour.
Incessant wind
Blowing sand
Hard to enjoy a grassy park (like Ruth Hardy) without dog walkers everywhere.
Lack of public restrooms.
Restaurants seem chronically understaffed and even when I place a mobile order well in advance they often don’t start it until after I wait in a long line. 
Plenty of shade parking at schools. Why not at shopping centers and parks? 
I know flash floods are a thing but do we really need massive dips at intersections that cause some folks to slow to a crawl to cross?
Landscapers bring traffic cones and shut down lanes where it isn’t necessary.
Inconsistent four-way stop behavior. Part of the problem is that people aren’t actually stopping, but rolling and improvising.  If I come to a complete stop, it seems to make it worse.
Broken sprinklers with massive water waste seems to be a thing.",t2_d193nu9x,DiligentExample207,0,1648033925.0,0,t1_i1s432x,i1s432x,True,tripacrossamerica,t3_tkc4c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/tkc4c9/palm_canyon_dr_palm_springs_ca_2022/,"Palm Canyon Dr., Palm Springs, CA, 2022",/r/palmsprings/comments/tkc4c9/palm_canyon_dr_palm_springs_ca_2022/i1s432x/,1,r/palmsprings,0,1

"Wondering when ""a couple of weeks"" might land?

Only because Coachella (aka Glastonbury of the Desert) is coming in mid-April, which might make availability of places even more challenging.

Farm is one of our more ""white tablecloth"" kinds of places - they may be able to accommodate but check with them.

If you are willing to venture a bit away from downtown, there's a great new place called Willie's in Rancho Mirage. Same great small local restaurant group that also owns/runs 849, Roly China Fusion & 1501 Uptown Gastropub. Willie's is a bit more high end $$$ but very good.

Joshua Tree National Park has groups that meet in the park regularly to view the stars.  Of course, some sky glow from Coachella Valley.

In 29 Palms there is an observatory that meets regularly (Saturday’s I believe).

The closest I have been to see the stars is up on Hwy 74, pulling off the road into a neighborhood or park (if they are left open).  Sky glow from Coachella Valley.

"Rentals are almost impossible. They were never plentiful here - few apartment buildings (a big chunk are on the south side of PS) and most homes for rent are managed as vacation rentals.

You probably want to be south of where the hospital is unless you like constant wind. You may find more availability as you go farther away from PS.

Your budget may make a difference. If you have over $2000 or $2500 you may find something more easily. In many places, you will have to show proof that your salary is 3x the price of rent. There are some people who rent and work here who live 45-60 minutes away, because towns like Beaumont, Hemet, etc are the nearest affordable ones.

Caliente Tropics is probably your best bet in that area, but will be a risk for children at the pool.

If you are spending time east valley, you might consider hotels in Palm Desert and Indian Wells - Shadow Mountain is a good value and location, not flashy, but well maintained.

You are in luck for tacos, the valley has top notch Mexican food - and I spent the last 20 years in San Diego. Cathedral City and east valley cities are hotspots for great authentic spots that easily rival what you find in San Diego.

"To answer some of the questions I've read throughout this post....

Spring break is happening NOW. By the time you'd be here in May, most colleges are wrapping up for the semester and academic year. Coachella will be done as well.

Your goal for $200 a night will be challenging but not impossible. You may find something because of your timing - May is generally when the snowbirds leave, as it starts getting really hot then. I'm not sure you'll get something with a great pool scene at that budget, though. Travel & hotels seem to be astronomically expensive this year any and everywhere you go, because of the pent up demand from COVID.

As for great food, there isn't a lot. Our two biggest audiences here are tourists and old people who think mayonnaise is spicy, so a lot of what's made here tends to land on the bland/middle of the road side. (Others have decent suggestions but tbh in any of the things I've tried, I wasn't overly thrilled.)

In fact, to be honest, looking at your dates? If you are renting a car, you should consider spending a few days in San Diego, or somewhere on the coast. SD in particular would give you some seriously great, authentic Mexican food. You could still have two or three days in PS/Bombay Beach area, too. And there's a wide range of hotel options there and slightly outside of the city that could be affordable. Just a thought. (We often did the same before we lived here - came for a week and spent a few days in PS and a few in either SD or LA/Long Beach.)",t2_1ztrsw3n,WavingOrDrowning,0,1647359422.0,0,t1_i0rg8ac,i0rg8ac,True,Slash_Dementia_67,t3_tehvy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/tehvy5/hotels_tacos_etc/,"Hotels & Tacos, etc.",/r/palmsprings/comments/tehvy5/hotels_tacos_etc/i0rg8ac/,3,r/palmsprings,0,3

 $20 for the first person, and $5 extra for each person after that (maximum of 4) if you all take the test in the same 15 minute time slot.  
  
note: Life Centers is a health care company that will supervise you taking an antigen test over the Internet using Google Meets. You provide your own rapid antigen test(s).

"To kill time I suggest Oak Glen. It’s 15/20 minutes off the freeway, up the mountain a bit on your way from the airport. They are a beautiful little u-pick farm area. They specialize in apples but depending on the season have berries, pears, peaches, etc. They have a village with tons of old fashioned food, desert and candy options as well as decor and souvenirs. Great antique shops. 

Each farm is a little different. 

I love Snow-line for their mini apple cider donuts and amazing wine and hard cider. The best apples I’ve ever had come from here 🤤 The staff is the sweetest. Even the farm hands tending to the field are so patient when people get it their way. Great raspberry field right next to the grass picnic area. 

Riley’s was great but the owner is a very opinionated man who treats his employees terribly. I refuse to support his business anymore. 

Rio’s has self guided nature paths and amazing pies. They also have BBQ. 

We usually hit at least two farms, Snow-line for donuts and a picnic then to Rio’s for pie and ice cream on the way back down the mountain. It’s easily done in a couple hours if your not looking to spend too much time exploring. 

Yucaipa and Beaumont have great antique stores as well but I wouldn’t spend time in Beaumont doing anything but antique shopping and checking out local farms. Very hit and miss area as far as inviting and touristy. 


On the right of the 10 (the freeway to PS) about 20 minutes up that mountain is Idyllwild. They’re a small touristy town worth some exploring. Great antique shops and cute restaurants. 

Temecula is out of the way. You’d be flying in then going the opposite way to get there. Even for a tasting, you’re correct, most would be closed. Dinner and a tasting at a restaurant would still work. If you’re going for a vineyard tour and tasting, stay in Temecula, schedule it for the morning and enjoy lunch at one of the many amazing places that usually also have wine and cider tastings. 

If you do go don’t miss Villa Di Calabro’s olive oil tasting. They have a wine and olive oil tasting as well as the most amazing peach sangria. Gorgeous little patio garden area right in the middle of down town Temecula. Their Rosemary olive oil on a steak is incredible. 

Call and find out but if you get to town earlier than check in most hotels will hold your luggage. This is most helpful after checking out but it could help before in your case. 

Cabazon is a huge gross casino. I felt dirty after touching the check in counter. Rooms are decent but the atmosphere is ehh. The pool area is awesome if not over run by people not handling their liquor well (holidays get nuts). So if you’re looking to gamble or chill by the pool it could work for you. There are outlet malls and bowling near by but not much else. 

Cabazon does have a travel center with cheaper gas prices. Hadley’s, an old school type farm stand turned bigger better store is next to it. Their date shakes are amazing! They usually have other local produce and snacks as well. 

We’re SoCal so there’s a ton to do within a couple hours any way of us. If you don’t mind driving more I can keep giving suggestions. East of PS also has tons of interesting things to explore. 

I hope this helps.

"What do you consider cool? A contemporary condo downtown? An indoor / outdoor pool with a midmod in suburbia? A trailer with lots of empty desert with a dragon sculpture in progress? Price range would be good to know too. 

I live in the design district, which is north'ish and love it, the winds here just make the palm trees russle and dance, but there are areas where they can be too much, but occasionally that is true everywhere in the valley. Noise can be a problem everywhere, you don't want to be on the flight path, even in Rancho.

You might want to be careful buying next to resorts. Their rhythm of noise is kind of opposite to normal living. Hotel guests are here to party and don't particularly care about the long-term relationship with their neighbors. I have a friend who moved to the other side of his apartment complex just to get farther away from the neighboring resort's pool.

No-chella was a thing where they were promoting folks not attending the event to stay at the pool parties, I don't think that was very successful. Who would pay triple market rate for a hotel room just to be left behind at a mediocre pool party?  


Edit: Afterparties are not common. The event runs until midnight and folks that return to their accommodation are generally wiped and lulled asleep by the long ride home.",t2_gmpus,codingclosure,0,1645832826.0,0,t1_hyg656v,hyg656v,True,doublenoodles,t3_t1g2x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/t1g2x0/whats_ps_like_for_coachella/,What’s PS like for Coachella??,/r/palmsprings/comments/t1g2x0/whats_ps_like_for_coachella/hyg656v/,3,r/palmsprings,0,3

"Downtown Palm Springs is incredibly gay friendly. Another poster here replied ""literally anywhere"" and this is really mostly true.

PS is not exclusively gay, but let's just say that in most downtown bars and restaurants, you wouldn't have to look far for a friendly face. But those faces will have a few lines and wrinkles...there's a reason PS is known as God's Waiting Room!

Some restaurants are LGBT owned or launched by LGBT folks, including Trio and Roly China Fusion. Farm is definitely the most high end, white tablecloth restaurant in downtown, and there are a few others. But PS cuisine is mostly aimed at tourists - middle of the road stuff best described by the word ""inoffensive.""

"If you are looking for just friendly as opposed to passionate about, and if you don't want to smoke in your room, almost anywhere is friendly. If you are vaping and moderately polite, no one will even notice or care where you are. I would save the big skunky joint for a smoking section, which is also a good way to make friends. Often I see people setting up the patio outside their hotel rooms with some icy glass rigs or bongs ( or both 'cuz vacation!) and they spend the day wondering between the pool and their patio. 

I'm not sure, but I think vaping is mandatory whilst dog walking, but maybe that is just my neighborhood. 😊 I don't know if you are from an illegal state, but one of the joys of living here is seeing people get high free for the first time.",t2_3moxazcm,INFJRoar,0,1645471057.0,0,t1_hxv8jht,hxv8jht,True,620_2900,t3_sxg6lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/sxg6lj/420_friendly_places_to_stay/,420 friendly places to stay??,/r/palmsprings/comments/sxg6lj/420_friendly_places_to_stay/hxv8jht/,3,r/palmsprings,0,3

If you could possibly grab a couple spots on a Charles Phoenix Bus tour it’s a couple hours hilariously and informatively well spent.

"I bring up housing because California ranks 49th/ 50 states in housing production. We’ve not been building enough homes since the 70s & the Valley prefers building luxury golf resort communities as opposed to middle class single family housing or middle class apartment housing so that does exasperate the issue when there’s not enough housing because it drives up the cost of rent on even lackluster housing & that affects people when the value of their income can’t cover their housing costs. I had a single bed apartment in 2013 on Tahquitz in Palm Springs for $750 a month, same complex charges $1600 today because there’s simply not enough housing in Palm Springs.

"Across the desert, the homeless population has been growing for a few years but I’d say certain areas have more concentrated populations & Palm Springs, DHS, & Indio have it the worst. There used to be two homeless shelters in the Valley, one in DHS, one in Indio. A few years back the city voted to close down the homeless shelter in DHS. So now only the Indio one is left in the east Valley. The problem is the shelter in Indio is always full & it’s on one end of the Valley, so everyone on the West end of the Valley has to find transportation to the east valley for a chance at a spot which is never guaranteed, & so many of them just choose to stay in place in Palm Springs or DHS. Palm Springs has the strip in downtown + a welfare office, Palm Desert has El Paseo + the mall + the college, La Quinta has Old Town, Indio has the courthouse + jail & a casino + a welfare office, Rancho Mirage has the River, Cat City has the Mary Pickford + a casino now + a welfare office = all of these places are hubs for the homeless to panhandle, find food, find shelter.",t2_d6vqovtu,peacelovelesbians,0,1645246710.0,0,t1_hxjk3q2,hxjk3q2,False,gomphosis,t3_svlzr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/svlzr6/how_safe_is_it_to_walk/,How safe is it to walk?,/r/palmsprings/comments/svlzr6/how_safe_is_it_to_walk/hxjk3q2/,4,r/palmsprings,0,4
"Yeah I don’t know if other areas have as bad of addiction issues as the desert does, but since we’ve been a meth & heroin haven for a few decades— that really affects our homeless hard. I’d say 8/10 homeless in the area have addiction issues, & mental health issues goes hand in hand with that. It’s not that homeless people in the area are a nuisance, it’s that they’re all addicted to drugs & that brings a slew of issues (aggression often being one). People used to just move out of the low desert to the hi desert areas when they’d be down on their luck but now even the hi desert is becoming expensive & there’s such a lack of housing options that it’s not as easy to just move north anymore.

I worked on the strip last year off Baristo & we had security outside our work for a reason. You do encounter some aggressive homeless people but more so like shouting/ yelling at nothing or random people walking by, catcalling especially when they’re in groups of older men, & I’ve seen fights happen but amongst themselves not necessarily against random civilians.

"I think you'll definitely enjoy Joshua Tree and/or Coachella and those should be easy and smooth experiences. The Atlas Obscura stuff is good too.

Did you just randomly plan this visit? Or did you time it to coincide with [Modernism Week](https://modernismweek.com/)? If you didn't know, Modernism Week is starting today. It is probably the biggest event to draw people to PS and one of the few that actually has people IN Palm Springs (vs Coachella or the tennis tournaments).

At almost any other time of year you could easily book a guided house tour, but this weekend may be a challenge, as many things for Modernism Week have been booked months in advance (and some events related to Modernism week are [sold out](https://modtix.com/e/mw22)).

Most restaurants will have a wait (and make sure you look at the most [updated info on COVID](https://www.palmspringsca.gov/government/covid-19-updates) here as you may be asked at some restaurants). A few of the very high end ones like Farm will likely require a reservation. But there's a lot to choose from in downtown.

"I moved here last year so I'll share some of my experiences from living here so far.

I have a unit that backs up to the wash. There are homeless people walking around and some under the bridge, however the police seem to come by nearly every day and so a lot of them scatter away towards the KFC or closer to Wang's. I feel pretty secure living here with the gates closing at night and the cops are really fast to respond here. 

My backyard has a pool and spa but not much else. Some units' yards are too small for pools. This can be a negative if you really want a pool and a yard. For me, other than the pool, I'm happy to not have a lot of upkeep in the backyard.

The neighbors (on my street) all seem really nice. It's mostly gay men and a few straight families. I've got to know a few of them as we commiserate some of the things that weren't completed in their homes on time.

Speaking of which, there were a LOT of incomplete repairs after moving in. It was annoying to have to be on top of contacting them, coordinating, waiting around for them to show, etc. There's still some repairs that Toll Brothers is aware of but we don't yet have a firm date for the repairs yet. Though the building manager is very respectful and helpful, the Toll Brothers management for this location was really poor. So many homes closed here with things that should've been repaired before closing. My neighbors had the same problems. Toll Brothers do send out people to make the repairs but the process is slow, which is really unfortunate. I put the blame on the higher ups at Toll Brothers who pushed for earlier closings to make their bonuses. So, if you do decide to move here, (on the walkthrough) and 2nd walkthrough, be sure to note every little scratch, check to make sure that all of the drawers close properly, check for paint splatters under sinks and poorly detailed painting around the bottom and edges of doors and on each step of your stairs. I'd also check to make sure that the garage door closes and opens properly and that they painted the wall where the garage door raises.

For the positives, I do really love living here. The views are fantastic. Most PS homes are one level so you are given one of the most unique views in the city. I also enjoy being able to walk to local gay bars like the Toolshed, PS Airbar, and even to the bars on Arenas. Walking around, it feels like city living and less residential, which for me, is a positive. I also really like that it isn't that windy down here. 

I'm excited for the development across the street, which will make this area even more unique and interesting. I'm also looking forward to the businesses that will open up near the front of the complex. It will make it feel even more like that city feel.

If you ever have any more questions about living here, please feel free to DM me.",t2_3mb9k,mikeyos,0,1645127458.0,0,t1_hxcm98s,hxcm98s,True,sharklasers805,t3_stjrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/stjrpn/cody_place_condos/,Cody Place Condos,/r/palmsprings/comments/stjrpn/cody_place_condos/hxcm98s/,3,r/palmsprings,0,3
