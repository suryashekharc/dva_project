The Farmer's Market is one of the best in the area.  Our Edmonds Chamber of Commerce puts on great events - the July Fourth parade and related events are some of the best in the region. I could go on about Edmonds but don't forget to explore the San Juan Islands - book a whale watching tour! Spend at least a long weekend exploring the Olympics National Parks.  Hiking?

"I dialed in to listen to the council meeting last night. Susan Paine and Laura Johnson did an incredible job of advocating for a much lower fee of $200 a month and the rest of the council was barely willing to compromise. Vivian Olson did agree to adjusting the proposed change from $750 a month down to $500 a month so that was at least somewhat in a positive direction and that’s what the final vote passed at. 

The director who drafted the ordinance for review was extremely confident that even $200 a month per restaurant more than covers the cost of renting nearby privately owned parking spaces to substitute. The council provided no justification for determining the rate of $500 a month… It seems only Susan and Laura are the voices of reason on our council. They’ll have my votes if they pursue re-election in the future!

"You can check day-of to see how the lines are:
https://wsdot.wa.gov/ferries

Edmonds isn’t one of the terminals you can make a reservation for ahead of time; so long as you make it past the toll booth and actually into the holding area they try to run only one boat behind on weekdays. Trick is that the line to the toll booth runs up WA-104, and you can end up stuck waiting to enter the holding area—especially on weekends. Sat & Sun are the worst, but Fri will still have some weekenders in addition to commuters.

I’d still suggest getting to the toll booth ~45 min to an hour before the ferry you plan to travel on (so aim to arrive as the 3:55 pm ferry is leaving if you want to make the 4:45pm one, etc). Also, be prepared in case you end up on the 6:15pm ferry.

"Edmonds is a somewhat snoozy little seaside town with more ""liberal"" leaning people than ""old school conservatives"", but it does have a very small yet noisy collection of conservative-leaning residents (e.g. check out the same names that continually pop up in the comments section of the online ""My Edmonds News"" - for them, ""Ballard"" is a code-word for social decline). Edmonds is changing (both politically and demographically), and it is becoming younger, more lively, and more interesting (still the small-town feel, but this is not the Edmonds of 20-30 years ago). Our city council meetings are lively and sometimes contentious, as the old guard slowly give way to a more liberal outlook among those elected to council. However, most residents are somewhat discrete/reserved in their political outlook, and the reds and the blues seem to genuinely get along well (e.g. there are a few Trumpatista's on my street, but they are dear friends/neighbours all the same).

"Hwy 99 *can* have rougher areas, but that doesn't mean there aren't really great businesses to check out! We have a great International District, and it's hard to go wrong with food anywhere along that stretch. Get a banh mi at Yeh Yeh's or Seattle Deli (or Rise and Shine when the new location opens!), Japanese style burgers at Katsu Burger, Pho Than or Pho 99 for your Vietnamese soup fix (there's nothing better on a chilly day), Korean fried chicken, dim sum at T&T... This is on top of the other amazing cafes and restaurants other people have mentioned. This is SUCH a fun area for food!!  

People will say ""live in the bowl,"" but that area is really bougie and expensive. Uptown, Esperance, and Hwy 99 are much more affordable and still really nice, just not as walkable.

Cole Gallery and Driftwood Modern, but totally depends on what you like so check the whole areas out.

"The Edmonds waterfront, at the ferry dock/Brackett’s Landing, has a long winding paved path that’s perfect for strollers, plus the beach is right there. Downside is it continues to be super popular even in quarantine so social distancing can be hard, especially on sunny weekends. Edmonds had to close Sunset Ave (the street that runs along the southern beach) at the height of the pandemic due to overcrowding.

There’s beaches at just about all the ferry docks, too, so Mukilteo might be an option as well. And ferry rides are really fun—though I’m not sure the walk-on passenger restrictions still in effect for COVID. (For cars they still want people to stay put and not walk around the boat unless you really need to.)

The Interurban trail also specifically runs through Lynnwood and the other suburbs/cities, so you might not even have to drive and park somewhere for a nice walking path: https://www.lynnwoodwa.gov/Community/Play-Lynnwood/Parks-Trails-and-Open-Space/Interurban-Trail

The area has a huge number of parks, too, and even the smallest will normally have a walking path around a garden or wild area, so they’re worth checking out.

If you don’t mind cemeteries, there’s a couple that are nice green spaces that have walking paths, plus there’s fun local history! (Bothell Pioneer Cemetery, Edmonds Memorial Cemetery, Hickman Park boarders Restlawn Memorial Park, etc).

Lynnwood and Edmonds certainly have their “cemented over” business districts, but there’s also random wild patches all over, so just walking through the local neighborhoods can feel scenic.",t2_pgvxn,lizardmatriarch,0,1617305883.0,0,t1_gt2dj2g,gt2dj2g,True,DanHoffman,t3_mhvz10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonds/comments/mhvz10/hiking_with_stroller/,Hiking with stroller,/r/Edmonds/comments/mhvz10/hiking_with_stroller/gt2dj2g/,2,r/Edmonds,0,2

Students from 3rd grade to 12th grade in the Edmonds School District will not return to in-person learning this school year, the district announced Wednesday. 

Edmonds children in kindergarten through 2nd grade will [return to campus in phases](http://edmonds%202nd%20grade%20students%20will%20return%20to%20campus%20on%20march%2022%2C%201st%20graders%20return%20march%2029%20and%20kindergartners%20are%20due%20back%20in%20class%20on%20april%2012./), starting March 22. 

The Edmonds School District sent the following letter to staff on Wednesday: 

""Due to the complexity of negotiating working conditions and the logistics of bringing more students to campus in the A/B hybrid model, the Edmonds Education Association and the district do not see that it is feasible to implement Stage 3 (3rd-6th grades) or Stage 4 (7th-12th grades) before the end of this school year. 

Stages 3 and 4 would likely not return to the classroom until May, leaving very few days of in-person instruction remaining as the school year ends at the end of June. The district is committed to working on other in-person opportunities and enrichment for students in grades 3-12, using indoor and outdoor spaces.""",t2_woeyd,shoan8,0,1614473254.0,0,t1_gp3ql2v,gp3ql2v,True,shoan8,t3_lu1g54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonds/comments/lu1g54/edmonds_students_grades_312_wont_return_to/,Edmonds students grades 3-12 won't return to classrooms this school year,/r/Edmonds/comments/lu1g54/edmonds_students_grades_312_wont_return_to/gp3ql2v/,2,r/Edmonds,0,2

"From the FAQ:



1.) Why are we working to recall Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney?


       
 A.) He has refused to enforce the “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” mandate issued by Governor Inslee

        
B.) He has encouraged the public to defy the “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” mandate

        
C.) He reinstated 3 deputies who were previously fired for cause, including killing an unarmed citizen, costing the taxpayers over $1M in restitution to the family. Two of the rehired deputies were found guilty of lying and can therefore not fulfill their duties to testify in court as a credible witness. Since being rehired, all 3 deputies have engaged in more unacceptable conduct:

   
D.) One lawsuit involved Fortney, Wallin, Boice and others for tasing and having a police dog bite a handcuffed man, 

  
E.) Another lawsuit involves Wallin violating the department's use-of-force policy by releasing a police dog on (and seriously injuring) a man without sufficient cause.



2.) Why were the deputies he reinstated fired?


       
 A.) Deputy Art Wallin was fired in October 2019 for shooting and killing an unarmed 24-year-old man. Taxpayers paid $1million to the family of the victim.

       
 B.)

"Edmonds school district has built new buildings for most elementary schools and overall the district is solid. There is a great co-op (maplewood) school in North edmonds that is part of district, I believe it usually has a waiting list.  I would go out on a limb and say if you have an edmonds address for the most part you can not go wrong.  

 Further north you get into mukilteo school district which is also a solid district, endeavor or picnic point are probably the better of the two elementary, I would check to make sure the elementary school feeds to harbor point middle.

"TLDR: The City of Edmonds had previously planned to promote its Assistant Chief, Jim Lawless, to Chief of Police after he had been working there for 25 years. But the city made an unexplained and sudden change, selecting the police chief of a 400-person reservation instead. The change seems to be predicated on the race of the two candidates, based on the following:

> [Mayor] Nelson cited ""social justice, and equity and accountability to the community"" as the impetus for the selection. He praised Pruitt's work on ""police accountability, transparency and recruiting of well-qualified, diverse candidates."" It read like it was crafted by the very BLM activists Nelson has been seeking to impress.

"Hey, first off, I was not trying to be disrespectful! I used ""Chump"" as part of your ""handle"", and I really wasn't trying to be insulting. Sorry if that wasn't clear.

Secondly, I don't agree that the Mayor and Council have the agenda that many people are accusing them of. Many of them are ""rookie"" politicians (Nelson's first term as Mayor, although he was a Councillor before that). I have taken the time to meet him, talk to him, and to try to at least figure out where he is coming from. He's not the ideologue that many accuse him of being (whereas I do believe that many of his critics have an all too predictable agenda). I simply ask that others take the time and effort to do the same, before opining.

They did their best, they fucked up the messaging, but in the final analysis they hired a fully qualified Chief. As for ""loyalty and service to community"", I don't think anybody is justified in saying that our Council isn't dedicated to that.

Lmfao most of the defenders of the process seem to resort to personal attacks as their default debate method. The city councilors who voted for Pruitt all told me that he was a qualified candidate, without giving an ounce of explanation as to what made him a better candidate than Chief Lawless. I am going to stick with my answer, which is that  Mayor Nelson and our council president are far more interested in national politics than small town policy, and because they want to feel good about themselves, decided that hiring a Black person to make a statement will end racism.

"To paint a picture:  Many streets in Edmonds end in cul-de-sacs.  I never thought I would be one of those people, we just had to get out of SLU.

There's a guy who lives across the street with what I would call a *very large* boat parked permanently  on the street. I'm not good at sizes, but it's a tad shorter than the size of a driveway, tall enough to block most of the view to their house, and has *four* motors - two very large. After moving in, someone stole all of his motors. There were three cop cars for three hours taking pictures and notes. So this is something of substance.

We had our first street ""pot luck"" (the street is about 25 houses, 5 -8 are rentals). We were welcomed graciously as ""new comers"".  And to be honest they were super nice. And they still are. We like them. We really do.

But at the pot luck they started talking about ""serious matters,"" ""it was mentioned that we should all drive down the 1/2 block at 10-15 mph and there was a blue Honda (mine) that has been seeing ""driving too fast - perhaps 20 miles an hour"". I might have driven 20-25 mph (max). How fast can you go when you're driving 1/2 a block? OK, I'm guilty.

So now I drive 10 mph -sometimes coasting -  and wave at everybody.

Then they warned everybody to be careful because somebody about a mile away ""had their car burglarized last month"". I mentioned the boat motors and was told that was a ""private issue."" and we ""can't talk about it."" I thought it strange that someone stole $30,000 of boat motors within 10 feet of my driveway and they were concerned about things happening blocks or miles away. 

What followed  was a big discussion about the fact the the ""Careful, children at play"" sign was too faded for anyone to see and the city didn't have funds to replace it. I said. ""I can get the EXACT same one delivered by Amazon tomorrow for $10, I'll be happy to order it and install it myself, and I don't care about the $10.00""  

They all said (politely) ""We appreciate the gesture by our new neighbors, but we have to go through city clearance and they told us that they wouldn't have funds till next year at the earliest."" When I said ""It's the same sign, only newer,"" they said ""things don't work like that here.""

None of this is to say we're not happy. ***We love it here compared to SLU***. No buckets of shit or needles. Plenty of exotic birds. But it seems clear that established people are ""watching things"" and ""noticing things"" and newcomers are being held under scrutiny.",t2_13yy70,chiltonmatters,0,1602999951.0,0,t1_g96qdrt,g96qdrt,False,Hot-Currency-8078,t3_jceagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonds/comments/jceagr/how_is_property_crime_in_edmonds/,How Is Property Crime in Edmonds?,/r/Edmonds/comments/jceagr/how_is_property_crime_in_edmonds/g96qdrt/,2,r/Edmonds,1,2

I just recently moved away from Edmonds, but lived in a house on 220th St for 21 years.

EDMONDS — A woman killed [in a triple-shooting in Edmonds](https://www.heraldnet.com/news/edmonds-triple-shooting-suspect-turned-self-in-police-say/) was identified Friday as Thanh Vy Ly, 20, of Mountlake Terrace.

The alleged shooter, Duy Phuon Nguyen, 27, remained jailed Friday with bail set at $3 million. An Everett District Court judge found probable cause to hold him behind bars for investigation of first-degree murder and two counts of first-degree assault, [for the targeted attack](https://www.heraldnet.com/news/3-shot-at-edmonds-market-gunman-at-large-police-say/) on his estranged wife around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Boo Han Market in the 22600 block of Highway 99.

Two of her friends, who were with her, were also shot.

One of them was her roommate Thanh Vy, who worked at the Korean market.

Thanh Vy died at Harborview Medical Center. An autopsy confirmed gunshots caused the death, according to the Snohomish County Medical Examiner’s Office. It was classified as homicide.

The other woman, 24, suffered a gunshot to the face.

&#x200B;

"I have been going to the qfc on 196 for many years every week. I know all of the employees. I have spent the last 3 weeks biting my tongue about the ""chin straps"" they wear. Finally, last week, I was so excited to know that everyone would be wearing masks because of the mandate. I bet everyone could figure out how that went...

First thing I saw as soon as I walked in were multiple people without masks. 2nd I went to the seafood counter where the employee (who never has his mask on properly) was wearing his mask on his top lip. I asked him very politely if he could please adjust his mask to cover his nose. I explained that the mask was not effective if it did not also cover the nose. He moved it and said it would be fine, as long as he ""didn't have to talk to anyone."" He said his mask slips down when he talks. As I noticed it wasn't cinched, I told him that might help. He said no, it ""only fogs my glasses, and I can't see.""

Moving on... More people without masks.

I see one of the supervisors I know well. I ask him why the store is allowing people in there without masks. He tells me, ""Well, we are trying to run a business."" I state that it is now the law, and people need to have them on. He says they don't want to make people mad at them. So I questioned why money was more important than the law, or their customers' safety. He said it was management's decision. I said as a nurse, as a mother, and as a community member, I do not feel safe in their store, and I would not be returning.

Apparently, downtown Edmonds is even worse. 

Funny, I was at Sprouts immediately prior to that, and they had no problem enforcing the mask mandate.",t2_527mfah2,AurianaWinz,0,1593622685.0,0,t1_fwlm7li,fwlm7li,True,NightlongCalcite,t3_hh8oah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonds/comments/hh8oah/mask_wearing_at_edmonds_qfc/,Mask wearing at Edmonds QFC,/r/Edmonds/comments/hh8oah/mask_wearing_at_edmonds_qfc/fwlm7li/,5,r/Edmonds,0,5
"Edmonds is beautiful place to live. Very family friendly area. There's lots to do and all of it is easily reached through the many different  transport options. Other communities that you may want to consider in near by areas that some may have more affordable-ish home prices and other maybe a bit more but I would recommend looking also into the Kirkland area its a bit more expensive and yuppy but a amazing place to grow up for kids of all ages from infant to young adult. Kenmore area is also amazing and little less expensive and yuppie. Kenmore/Bothell area is a blue collar neighborhood that's being developed like crazy right now. Property values in that area are going up constantly. Also the Northshore school district is one the best around. Property values in Edmonds are also on the rise with the light rail transportation thats currently being built. Light rail will cover from the Edmonds/Lynnwood area all the way to downtown Seattle. All the light rail stations and track that their building now will make the Edmonds and surrounding areas a more affordable area to live for people who work downtown but don't want the downtown Seattle cost of living. Schools in the Edmonds district are very good. There has been a rise in gang related type activity in Meadowdale High School but there are other schooling options such as Scriber Lake High School which we just switched our teen age son to. Scriber is amazing. Pre covid the classes at Scriber where deliberately kept at a smaller size so that students actually get the help they need instead of just being another body in a seat. The faculty is much more hands on and teachers are availible for a more one on one type education since they have more time that they can spend with individual students if they need it. There's more parks scattered around from Kirkland to Edmonds. There's Meadowdale park on Olympic View Drive in Edmonds thats massive it has a off leash dog area, skateboard park, basketball courts, baseball fields, tennis courts, hiking trails, and much more. I could go on and on about Kirkland/Kenmore area where I grew up and the Edmonds/Lynnwood area where I've been living for the last 12yrs. There's something to do for everyone and nothing is more then an hour away. On day to day life situations there's farmers markets all around and all major brand name grocery store chains are within a 10 min drive give or take a few minutes. There's Alderwood Mall which is pretty big mall also within a 10-15 min drive. Fun fact Washington is the only state that has every type of land and nature all within one state from mountains and woods, rain forests to coastline beaches and in eastern washington we have desert type landscapes and the Columbia River gourge area with its southwestern looking landscape and what I call our miniature not so grand canyon. The Gourge amphitheater is an amazing place to watch a concert and camp out. Its about a 2.5 ish hour drive from Edmonds but sooo worth it. If you ever have a chance to go see a show there don't miss out. It's beyond incredible. I could go on an on about why living in Western Washington and how awesome it is but no matter how much I say how incredible it is you have to be here to really feel and see the beauty of it.

"I’m gonna be a senior at Meadowdale this upcoming school year, and all of the teachers I’ve had I didn’t really have a problem with (except one, but we don’t need to talk about that).

"Edmonds is a really nice little town. Lots of nice restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Good parks (including one with an outdoor pool), stunning views of the Olympic mountains and the Puget Sound.. because it's right on the waterfront. Easy to take a ferry to Kitsap Peninsula.. Makes for a fun day out (Poulsbo is pretty fun).

You can take a train to downtown Seattle, although it drops you at King St. Station, so if you need to get.. well, more or less anywhere useful downtown, it's not fantastic. Commute to downtown Seattle by car is kind of a nightmare from Edmonds. Plan on an hour each way during rush hour(s).

In the summer time, there's a weekly farmer's market in the middle of town. It's one of my favourites in the area. Lots of arts and crafty type stuff as well as good produce.

Shopping? Eh.. it's ok. Mostly you would have to leave Edmonds for shopping, but not too far. Groceries you've got a QFC and a PCC. Costco is pretty close in Shoreline. For clothing or anything else, you're going to want to hit Alderwood mall in Lynnwood, or Amazon.

Young kids would probably enjoy the easy access to the beach. Teens would likely be fairly bored. There's not much for them to do there. There is (at least, was.. who knows if it will survive COVID-19) a movie theater in town, but it's small. Alderwood Mall has a big theater which may be more popular with kids and there are reasonable bus options for teens.

One con.. there's a train line which goes right through the waterfront area of town. Freight trains go through pretty often and they will blast their horns loud enough to give you permanent hearing damage if you're too close. If you live a bit up the hill though, it's not so bad.

"The School District killed OP before they could finish the post.

&#x200B;

But in all seriousness, OP, I completely understand. My brother's a graduating senior, all my friends are graduating seniors, and it's incredibly unfair and completely impersonal to do such a thing. Any sort of pre-recorded message is incredibly impersonal and feels like little effort was put in, and you guys are totally getting cheated.

The downside to the live ceremony on Zoom is that there are *far* too many students in some schools for this to be a good idea, and the district probably didn't want some kids being like ""hey, why did the kids from \[other school\] get to do THIS cool thing? this is unfair!"" so they likely tried to find a happy medium. Pre-recorded messages are lame and pretty dumb, for sure. Hopefully when this whole quarantine is over, you can have a proper sort of graduation.

I grew up in lynnwood and most of my friends were in edmonds. It all seemed fine growing up and all of a sudden a few years back both seemed to get a lot more criminal activity. I went to school with the guy who killed his dad. Literally hung out with him every day. I never could notice any mental issues. He had some personal stuff that the media isnt talking about like how he identified as a woman about 3 years ago and stopped after a few months. I went to superbowl parties at his place that his dad set up and they were fun even though we were sophomores hanging out with 40 year old guys. His family is one of the nicest families I've come to know and I feel so bad for his mom,t2_777m6,deliciousdave33,0,1574830022.0,0,t1_f8uhybh,f8uhybh,False,invno1,t3_dzte60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonds/comments/dzte60/edmonds_man_in_custody_thursday_after_telling/,Edmonds man in custody Thursday after telling police he killed his father,/r/Edmonds/comments/dzte60/edmonds_man_in_custody_thursday_after_telling/f8uhybh/,2,r/Edmonds,0,2

"There’s the Cascadia Art Museum by the waterfront (by the train parking lot by Top Pot Donuts).

There’s the Edmonds Center for the Arts that will have shows. They might be between theater seasons at the moment, but they have music there too.

Edmond’s historical museum is cute, and has a rotating show about local history. Their hours can be a little finicky to visit during though. 

There’s also a bunch of plaques by old buildings in the downtown by the historical museum if you want to do a self guided walking tour.

All sorts of cafes and shops if you just want to hang out.

I honestly can’t keep track of all the green spaces and parks—there’s the larger ones like Meadowdale Beach Park that you have to hike a mile in, and is mostly wooded trails with a tiny beach access that’s probably closed for the season (tiny gaps and water don’t mix safely); but also smaller ones like the overlook on Olympic View Road (literally just a bench and three parking spots on one of the curvy, expensive residential streets down the bluff. Gorgeous view).

Not sure what festivals are coming up. I think the weekend/farmer’s market is done until November, then we have a Holiday market until Christmas.
