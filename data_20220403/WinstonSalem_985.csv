"Oak Hollow Lake in High Point has a unique fishing trail that is designed for new and experienced anglers seeking to do a bit of Small Mouth Bass fishing. 

It's a great spot if you're completely new, and especially if you have a kayak or watercraft. There is bank fishing there, too. 

Also, Hanging Rock has a lake with scheduled trout releases. I believe the next release is April 7—they'll be hungry for that artificial stuff. I believe we're within an hour of a few trout streams, but this is the closest, to my knowledge, where you can do some easy trout fishing. Just remember to get the appropriate fishing license. 

As far as Winston goes, Salem Lake is a great resource. It's even better if you can rent or use your own water craft. 

Happy fishing! 🎣

"Exactly.

I'm being downvoted because the conventional wisdom that is parroted is that people in the mental health field always want to help you, going to the emergency room is always a good idea, and that if you're feeling even the slightest bit suicidal, to just tell ANYONE mental health or public safety related and you'll get help.

Yeah, just randomly calling 911, or showing up at an Emergency Room, or telling a therapist you're new to working with that you're not feeling well and having thoughts about suicide is. . .well, a really, REALLY bad idea.

If you call 911, they'll send police, and police are trained to consider people in mental distress to be tactical threats and treat them as such.  A LOT of therapists and psychiatrists just rubber-stamp want to send anyone in distress to an ER.  People in an ER just want to send them to a psych ward for a hold. . .and psych wards are more like a jail than a hospital.  The whole system boils down into a solution of just throwing people in de-facto jail if they're having problems.

One of the people I knew who helped form my opinion was a college friend of mine, who was going through a real bad breakup.  She was seeing a therapist, and had JUST started to see her, like in her 2nd or 3rd session. . .and apparently in the course of the appointment she said the wrong Magic Words and the therapist very calmly, comfortingly told her that she should go to an emergency room right now, in fact to go to the one only a block from her office and she'd walk her there.  

Confused and scared, she did exactly that, her therapist walked her to the ER a block from the office, and the rest was rather a blur other than she was put on a psych hold. . .and the trauma of that hold and basically being treated like a prisoner and hauled off to the state mental hospital for 3 days was more traumatic than the breakup that she was seeing a therapist about.  Needless to say, she didn't go back to that therapist. . .or any other, after getting out.

That was 20 years ago, she's now mentally a wreck of anxieties and phobias, and it took her most of those 20 years to just feel safe to talk to anyone professional about her problems after that (it took a telemedicine app, where she wasn't physically where the therapist could be near her to make her feel safe enough). . .and that therapist was pretty quick to diagnose her with PTSD from her psych hold those two decades ago.",t2_6mh2t836,MyUsername2459,0,1648907986.0,0,t1_i33x3mt,i33x3mt,False,F0r35tImP,t3_tu5f00,https://www.reddit.com/r/winstonsalem/comments/tu5f00/the_hospital_has_taken_my_son_hostage/,The hospital has taken my son hostage,/r/winstonsalem/comments/tu5f00/the_hospital_has_taken_my_son_hostage/i33x3mt/,-4,r/winstonsalem,0,-4

"What? This is completely false. Biological parents by default are the child’s guardians if the right forms are signed during birth (typically birth certificate process).

Only if the parent is determined to unfit to make decisions for their child is guardianship changed. This is a legal process that requires a court ruling. It is not something that can be taken from you as a parent by anyone else than the court except for in situations of imminent danger. 

This means the hospital can separate you from the child until the imminent danger has passed. But after that, plans for care fall within the guardian (parent) domain.

"Yes the IVC is temporary and is 3 days I believe. My good friend is going through this with their child who has attempted suicide multiple times within tbe last 6 months. My friends child has been in the hospital I’d say about 4 times due to attempted suicide. The child has been held within the hospital for the 72 hours and then released. The child is also 13. My friends child was also relocated to a state facility for mandatory psychiatric care for the first attempt. IIRC it was for 2 weeks and my friend and their partner were  involved (kept in the loop I should say) with their child’s care the entire time. Now I know OP may be a different situation but there may be something missing from the story? A misunderstanding of how this process works? Idk but I do empathize because I’ve had many loved ones and direct family members institutionalized (albeit in another state) where their hands were forced and they had to go somewhere due to the mental condition they were in. It’s scary and it’s not fun but it will hopefully help the child.

Edit: This way, you could know what medications he's on. Sometimes they over prescribe. This whole country over-prescribes in my opinion.

"Winston-Salem and the immediate triad are in for a huge boom.  That means there will be a lot of influx of people from all over our country.  1 thing I learned going across country recently is that rudeness you mentioned, and the noise/loudness- that's unfortunately everywhere these days.  People have been displaced into areas they wouldn't normally be since the pandemic flipped everyones living around and it's actually nationwide now. 

Similarly to say, how the Bay Area people are feeling about crime and the sheer rudeness of people is what drives those people out of those areas and into other areas.

This does 2 things:

Yes it can bring troubles you ""have never seen in your town before"".  

But the better thing is folks from across the country are coming into otherwise quiet, southern charm cities and are able to learn and grow from the experience and that actually leads me to a 3rd thing...

Everyone grows from it.  You realize you can't run away from those simple problems like rudeness and un-affordability of housing because that's never the real solution.

Just because everyones moving somewhere doesn't mean you have to, too.  

Perhaps locate some information on your local leaders and see if you can join a peaceful organization that can help you voice your concerns with the city.

"Here’s the thing no one is addressing. Downtown is twenty mins from any direction in the county. We don’t hangout downtown, we go everywhere in the county to have fun. There’s a reason a lot of people live on the “out skirts”. Lower taxes! Take Robinhood Road for example. You go from the sticks to downtown on the same road! You can change your vibe on a 5 minute drive. I would highly recommend looking at surrounding nooks. Lewisville, Clemmons, Kernersville. East and West are the safest parts. You’ll want to steer clear of living on the South and North sides. Very congested areas. Most people work in these areas. Of course, Rural Hall is the exception. It’s very quaint. Your neighbors will probably have a Trump sign, but not everyone is hardcore conservative if that’s something you’re worried about.

-Old Salem (downtown)
-Shacktown Falls (twenty mins west of Lewisville)

"Agreed that psych patients get involuntarily committed quite aggressively and, once the deed is done, it’s hard and expensive to reverse.

That said, if a single person kills themselves after expressing concerning features of suicidal ideation, especially a minor, and we don’t do this, every assessing physician’s ass is grass.

I’m not minimizing how awful this must be for y’all.
But, if you’re going to do something abt it once this is over, lobby for real malpractice reform. If that was in place there’s a *chance* your psychiatrist would have said “Hey…I think he needs help but if you take him in expect this is how it’s going to go. You decide what’s best.”

I’m not a psychiatrist but I think similarly in many situations because of liability concerns. It sucks. I hate it. It’s the world I practice in and I can’t change it.

"First of all, I am so sorry you are in this situation. As someone who spent time in a NC psychiatric facility, I can say that they are not helpful. There were children there at the time who were an obvious risk to themselves & others, and sometimes when parents are truly out of their depth it can be the best thing for parent and child. Clearly that is not your situation. In my experience after a certain period of time (usually a week) if your child is cooperative and showing signs of genuine contentedness/not expressing signs of suicide/self harm, then they can be released. For now, be patient, be there for your child. Afterwards, I would recommend investing in a therapist that your child feels comfortable with. PLEASE be mindful of medication they put them on. Often children that age have trouble expressing what they mean, and the workers in that facility can be persuasive and quick to make assumptions. I wish I could offer more help.

"I use to take the bus everywhere when I lived there (born in Winston and moved this year) Pre pandemic it was reliable. The furthest I’d go is the area past the mall near Kohl’s and Ulta for work. The busses around the mall are the best. Theres a two that go downtown and to the mall if I’m not mistaken. 

When the pandemic started and I had to be downtown early for my coffee shop shift there were a few times the bus was late and the online tracker wasn’t working/accurate. So i’d have to rush to work from the station. There was also an occasion pre pandemic when the bus never showed up to my stop because it was super late and they never sent a van to finish the in bound route. Luckily I had a ride.  This was all on route 92. I’d say as a student you can’t beat it. A monthly bus pass is $30. And it’s more than likely a dollar to ride. I know the stopped running some routes on weekends and nights. But a lot run Monday-Saturday until midnight. And theres a few Sunday routes too.  I will say that downtown gets kinda sketch at night. There were two fights breaking out last time I was downtown at the bus station at night. But theres security. Just keep your wits about you. 

I also found out, via a driver, that you can’t use a transfer if you’re not going downtown to another bus. I would always take a transfer I were going to Food Lion or to run a quick errand downtown since I would only need to use one bus and the drivers never said anything until last fall when I was going home from food lion (which is the same route to where i was living at the time) i swiped the transfer but she said i needed to still pay a dollar. Luckily a nice guy gave me a dollar back. All in all it’ get you where you need to be. You might have to walk a ways if the stop is further from destination but it’s fine. They also have college shuttles that go downtown for WSSU and  WFU so if you go to either school look into those. But if you can, have backup transportation. Like set aside money for Uber, Lyft, or gas money for a relative/friend because while WSTA is reliable they will let you down some days and you’ll be late.",t2_8b1d5z7z,kmxt--,0,1648845574.0,0,t1_i312wvw,i312wvw,True,[deleted],t3_ttakm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/winstonsalem/comments/ttakm7/using_buses/,Using buses,/r/winstonsalem/comments/ttakm7/using_buses/i312wvw/,1,r/winstonsalem,0,1

"So Salem was originally a Moravian religious settlement and to live there you were required to have a trade you practiced. They would purchase people who were skilled in the trade they needed and as soon as they earned their purchase price they were freed(hoping they would stick around of course, and many of them did.) Still not great, but better than most Americans during that time. The town of Winston slowly grew up outside of it for those who were not vocational, and the Moravians established their post office there because they did not want such around. I know it comes first and that’s why it’s started just being colloquially “Winston” since the merge in the early 1900’s but I wish it were referred to more in whole, or as Salem sometimes. Anywhooo

I’m from Winston-Salem and moved to Raleigh since my partner goes to university here. Definitely go to Krankie’s coffee one morning they have phenomenal coffee and they’ve grown to serving alcohol and more food over the years, it gets crowded but for good reason. Check out hotdog city if you like hotdogs. Go to Prime Tyme if you want some soul food and delicious kool-aid served at a restaurant. Would recommend sweet potatoes but you already know! You probably won’t find a place for sale there right now, but Bethania is a cool village on the north side of town as you’re headed to tobaccoville with rich history and nice walking trails, much more nature-y than quarry park. Bethabara Park was the temporary settlement of the Moravian’s as they scouted and then built Old Salem, it’s not near as big and only has a few structures standing but they have a nice garden and also trails. Whatever you do just don’t end up buying one of those new modular homes they love to just put on top of each other everywhere land can be bought. There are a lot of good homes spread out around camel city. 

There’s also an old Shell station that is literally their logo in 3D if you’re into stuff like that. I guess I am biased because I grew up in Winston-Salem but I don’t see much of a difference, honestly. Raleigh has way more trees in the city itself. 440 makes it way easier to get around than 52/business 40. If anything the people here in Raleigh drive better. It’s weird because they’re more aggressive and will pass you in a heartbeat yet more likely to let you over when you signal. Cost of living is getting higher and higher in the tre-4 and will be similar to the triangle before long. It’s just as gentrified. You said you love the mountains and y’all both work from home so I would check out more walnut cove/tobaccoville/maybe even up towards sandy ridge property is more affordable and you can immerse yourself in the landscape easier. Close enough to the city you can go for inspiration, events, and weekend fun but far enough for your peace and quiet. I’m a country boy at heart tho.

"I'm sure you know this from Google Maps, etc., even if you haven't driven down it first-hand, but Main Street in that stretch is 2 lanes with a 35mph speed limit. However, because it is dead straight and has a long hill that descends from Acadia or so down to the traffic circle by Old Salem (or ascends, depending on your direction of travel), people can drive pretty fast along there. There's not a ton of speed enforcement and it is something of an artery. And some of the cars are noisy--your occasional modified Mustang or shit-flinger pickup, as well as emergency vehicles.

On the whole, however, Washington Park is lovely, especially closer to the park. UNCSA has performances practically every night this time of year--plays, chamber music, dance, orchestra, jazz, student film screenings, opera--and many of those are on campus, easily walkable from WP. Easy access to some of the best parts of the greenway system. Some cool businesses with more on the way. And the actual park is great, with renovations underway (new picnic shelters and restrooms, etc.) and one of the best playgrounds in town (the ""Dinosaur playground""). 

It's zoned for Diggs-Latham Elementary, I believe, which has its challenges. It serves a lot of lower-income students and has many of the challenges you see in most low-income schools. It does, however, have a very interesting arts magnet program and some deeply dedicated teachers.

"I'm not sure your price point, but as far as neighborhoods, I would recommend parking at the following locations and walking through the neighborhoods if the weather allows.  I cannot vouch for private property rules, so be sure to park somewhere where you will not be towed.  I've always felt you get the best sense of a neighborhood by walking through it vs. driving through it.  These neighborhoods are all very walkable, but certainly not the only great neighborhoods in the area. 

Even in the same city, the topography is very different in different neighborhoods. Parts of West End feel like the mountains, with winding, hilly streets, and Ardmore is more of a grid and mostly flat.  That is one major difference between Winston and other big cities in the state - we are at the foothills of the mountains, and you can certainly feel it.

* Ardmore - park at Ardmore Baptist Church.  Walk down Miller towards Hawthorne, taking side streets.  Once you hit Hawthorne, head west until you hit Stella Brew.  Grab a hot dog at PBs or a coffee at Ardmore Coffee.
* ""Old"" Sherwood Forest - park at Shaffner Park off Silas Creek, walk up Kirklees, taking side streets.

"Sounds like you’ve hit some of the stuff downtown. When you visit Reynolda House, don’t just take in the house itself. Spend some time in Reynolda Village and in the gardens. Walk the path to the Wake Forest campus. If you dig art, you need to go on campus and check out the art collection (for 50 years or so Wake has been amassing an art collection selected by students. Some of it is on display in the Benson Center). Also, SECCA is close by and has some great stuff. Take a walk through Old Salem. Old Salem has more preserved colonial and pre colonial structures than Colonial Williamsburg. If you like good beer, Fiddlin Fish is nice as is Hoots.

A technician at a community pharmacy or your local chain drug store has far different responsibilities from a hospital pharmacy technician. Retail pharmacy has its own serious issues, so I won't denigrate the difficulty of working as a tech in that setting. It's hard work, they play a critical role, but the responsibility is different from a hospital system. Techs in the hospital are working with more dangerous drugs, and the patients they serve are obviously in more critical states of health than the community setting in most situations. They should absolutely make well above minimum wage.

Your assumption of upward mobility is also misinformed. You were ""promoted"" with a 10% raise? Good for you. Pharmacy technicians have their own heirarchy in some cases, but they cannot simply be promoted to the much higher-paying role of pharmacist. That requires a lot of additional and costly education.

Not denying that this story may be lacking some details, but to paint OP as deliberately omitting some inconvenient details is inappropriate given your lack of understanding of his role.",t2_10aekc,_meatbawl,0,1648734671.0,0,t1_i2uigfs,i2uigfs,False,Kittens-of-Terror,t3_tsnkuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/winstonsalem/comments/tsnkuc/just_got_forcibly_removed_from_my_own_workplace/,Just got forcibly removed from my own workplace at Wake Forest Medical for attempting to disseminate 2000 of my homemade flyers showing the 2% raise the techs got for Covid vs the CEOs' >24% raises last year.

"Nah, just pointing out that those who usually are advocating for a minimum wage increase target $15 an hour. This evil hospital system has done that without government intervention. 

A pharmacy tech should obviously make more than minimum wage, and he did. He even got a 2% raise within his first 4 months of working there (he admitted he just moved here at Thanksgiving).

That explained some of the information that some of the attorneys I spoke with told me. After that, I was more strategic in what I asked them, so I could determine what their motives were.

"Thanks for the advice. I did speak with a lawyer before the apartment management went to the debt collector, but they said I can't sue the apartment because I didn't lose money, but rather the apartment is the one who can sue me. Also, the apartment didn't collect security deposit from me, and their lease agreement says they can charge me for damages. Again, I argued that the tenant protections still applied to me and the lawyer agreed, but the only solution they gave me was to dispute the collection, but when the debt collector is their own affiliated party, there's no hope that I'll get an impartial review.

"Not in one of those areas, but avoid Stafford Place 'Luxury' Apartments off Peters Creek. We moved out of there after 3 years, and they charged us $1600 to replace the entire kitchen cabinet set because one of the cabinet doors was worn (not damaged in any way, just the paint faded because it's under the sink). We even had the head maintenance guy come in and take a look at everything before we moved out. He conveniently left this out, and charged this against us to the management. After I refused to pay this (but paid $200 for that one door), they sent us to their  affiliated debt collector. I even showed the debt collector the nc tenant law saying tenants can only be charged for the damage they caused not the cost of total replacement, but the debt collection agency reported this as past due to the credit bureaus and brought our credit down by 100 points. I'm determined to never pay this back, and feeling bad to have even paid the $200 toward this. My credit is still good even after that 100 point hit.

"“Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,”
‭‭I Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

Idk what you believe in but please consider believing in Jesus and His life, death on the cross, and resurrection for your sins. If you’re a true believer, then good. That shooting at Kermit’s is just a reminder how we can be dead in an instant. 

Jesus saves. Repent of your sins and believe the gospel. No good work you do can save you and make you righteous before God, only the blood of Jesus that washes away past, present, and future sins. Seek forgiveness from God believing in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We’re not guaranteed tomorrow. Eternity last forever, if you’re not trusting in Jesus for your salvation but instead you’re trusting in your own goodness (your good works), then you’re only gonna end up in hell, sounds harsh but it’s facts. No good works can save you. No religious activity can save you. Only Jesus can. Turn to Him and call out to Him for forgiveness. Begin a relationship with Jesus and God the Father. Jesus lived a perfect life on this earth while He was fully human, but also, He was fully God too. Jesus is God. That’s why He was able to remain sinless, but because He took on the likeness of human flesh, Jesus death on the cross was the perfect sacrifice for all our sins. Jesus was risen by God 3 days later after Jesus died on the cross. Jesus is alive and is coming back. We all going to stand before Jesus. Whoever reading this, the ball is in your court. Realize that you and I aren’t good people at all because we sinned against an infinitely Holy God and we deserve death for paying for our sins in hell (apart from God) for eternity. God doesn’t want no one to perish in Hell. Please accept His free gift of Salvation by believing in (having faith, trusting) in the finished work of Jesus Christ for your sins aka repent of your sins and believe the gospel. Nothing can save your soul from eternal damnation except believing in Jesus and His finished work on the cross. And lastly, the gospel doesn’t give you a license to sin all you want. If you truly believe in the gospel, you wouldn’t want to sin because you’re grateful for what God has done by offering you salvation.

"Am in the process of this right now. Went the permitting route to finish installation of a bathroom in a partially finished basement. 

Haven't gotten to inspections yet, but have learned a ton about the right way to do things. Doing all ourselves, but it's just a half bath so no shower or tub to fool with. But still have framing, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical to pass. Each costs a separate fee on top of the general permit.

Highly recommend adding more to your budget to accommodate for cost of permits and what you will have to do (correctly) to pass inspections.

"Let me first say that this is NOT an attack on OP. I know this is coming from the heart.

Zelenskyy is a moron. He’s been begging for us to install a no fly zone aka start WW3. I don’t care what he wants. He is corrupt as hell. He wants to stir up emotions to drag us into their war. It isn’t our fight. Putin is an asshole and what he is doing is horrible, but this shit happens all over the world all of the time. No chanting in the streets or lighting up buildings is going to stop this.
