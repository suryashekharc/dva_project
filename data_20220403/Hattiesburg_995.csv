A poli-sci prof who taught at USM in the late 90s-- don't recall his name but he's almost certainly dead now; short, thin white-haired guy with glasses who was educated at Harvard College (wasn't Chuck Davis)-- told us that ""Golden Eagles"" was a major code word used by terrorist groups, and that saying it in a phone call (like, ""Hey, did you catch the Golden Eagles game last week?"") would flag the call and trigger NSA monitoring systems.

There's a certain places in Hattiesburg I don't go. You can call it whatever you want to call it but to me it's self-preservation. I've been living here since 2010 and I've been to the zoo twice.

"It's been several years since I looked at rentals, but there are a few apartment complexes in the Oak Grove school district (that's not the correct term since the school is part of the Lamar County School District).

Petal is a well-oiled machine with lots of great teachers. They were the top-rated district in the state when I taught there, and that's no surprise having seen how they operate. The principal of Petal Primary told me that they have a 95% graduation rate for students who go to Petal schools from K-onward.  Oak Grove is close to Petal in that regard, from all I've heard.

Also have to keep in mind the building is old as shit, and the appliances are fine mostly but they do reflect their age a little.

"I have lived in Two Square and Claridge House, both are good 2 bedroom options for a modest price. They were both ~$750, but that was a few years ago. 2 Square has had some improvements since then.

Claridge house is slightly safer, but you will deal with the bustle of USM during big games and graduation. That can be very annoying.

I have had my bike stolen at 2 Square. It’s not unsafe, but it’s by itself, so I imagine criminals are more ballsy. I think it’s perfectly fine though. There’s no vagrants hanging outside or whatnot.

Both are under the same realty group. It’s the main one in Hattie and I haven’t had any problems with them. Other rental realty companies have given me grief.

"So, let me be perfectly clear - I am literally unable to care any less about this entire situation. On the “Does this Matter?” meter, this whole thing ranks about somewhere between “Who gives a shit” and “Huh. Oh well.”

I’m just telling you - from an outsiders perspective - your friend comes across like the one who is in the wrong and also the one who is being rude. Despite whatever pictures they take, no matter how they feel they should have been handled. They don’t know what was going on with the staff or their schedule.

Here’s how it went down in my mind (which is again, just an outsiders perspective)

You friend set an appointment. He then goofed up and thought it was at 9 when it was ON the 9th. He shows up two hours early, the staff thinks “Wow, that guy’s early as hell. Oh well” and goes about their business doing their jobs in capacities not necessarily recognizable by your friend who I presume just got there for the first time. Then your friend gets online and leaves a bad review. When the business responds and says he arrived too early, instead of going “Oh whoops, I must’ve mixed up my times” like a normal person would, they get smarmy and have you try to stoke a fire on Reddit about a situation that makes both of you kinda look rude and makes me feel bad for the folks at the business that have been dealing with you.",t2_45inh,DoctorMcTits,0,1639281629.0,0,t1_ho7g4bc,ho7g4bc,False,[deleted],t3_re7pel,https://www.reddit.com/r/hattiesburg/comments/re7pel/radiant_reflections/,Radiant Reflections,/r/hattiesburg/comments/re7pel/radiant_reflections/ho7g4bc/,1,r/hattiesburg,0,1

Edited to be clearer why I think that:

It appears this company searched their appointment records and found your friends name as scheduled at 11. It doesn’t look like they’re blaming your friend.

Also, kids HAD to take a milk even if they didn’t want it, and the cafeteria couldn’t put unopened milks back in the cooler. End result was hundreds of little cartons of milk being tossed directly into the trash, unopened and still cold. The food itself isn’t the problem but a lot of the short sighted rules about nutrition need to be evaluated. Put some salt in the veggies and maybe the kids will eat them.

"Yes. I am suggesting that. You have zero idea how the psych world works it sounds like. You do realize that kratom is a PARTIAL opioid agonist the same as buprenorphine, however the active chemical of kratom, mitragynine, has a far shorter half life and tends to lead to far worse withdrawals in individuals than buprenorphine. For fucks sake I can’t believe some of you chucklefucks buy into “kratom SAVES ALL HeRoIN AdDiCtS” kinda bullshit. Yeah. It helps some people. I don’t think it should be illegal. But it is not as well studied nor can it be as accurately managed as buprenorphine. No psychiatrist is going to continue to manage a patient’s meds who is actively using kratom AND Xanax, while they might if it’s a buprenorphine and Xanax combo which is less dangerous in the long run.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"What I’ve been telling people here is that it’s really important that you be smart and careful. Remember that the hospitals in the area are already over-taxed and if you go driving around afterwards to “check it out,” and get in a wreck, you may not receive the medical care you would normally. Don’t go chain sawing any downed trees unless you know what you’re doing. Be very careful of downed power lines, etc. Every storm, someone dies due to carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of a generator. 

In Katrina, I slipped and fell down my back stairs. These days, a fall like that might really hurt me, but I might be out of luck at the ER. 

Now this may be no Katrina to us, but keep in mind that although we sit an hour and a half north of the Gulf, that storm knocked out power for weeks for many people here.

"Anyone remember Speed's Restaurant?  

Speed's restaurant must have been well known.  This ad

* does not include a street address, just ""Broadway Drive""
* does not include a phone number
* indicates private facilities for ""a hundred or two""

Also, here is a post card showing Speed's restaurant.  Typical look for a 1950s diner (I guess, I am no expert).  

Based upon google maps, and nearby buildings age... I can only guess the location was swallowed up by the car dealerships and auto parts store south of downtown, before the cloverleaf.

"I disagree, but you're welcome to have your own opinions. I've been to Nellie's many times since they first opened, and the quality has dropped while the prices have gone up. 

The first week they were open I was stoked about having a place close to my home that had decent food and drinks I could take back home. I'm unsure about your experiences with daiquiris, but for my personal preference, Nellie's is a lower quality along with more expensive for the size than I'm used to getting. 

I love local businesses, and I do my best to support the ones that continue to maintain quality at an affordable price. Here are some of the local places I would say are outstanding:

Mulvis, Gratefull soul, Fairleys, Southbound, Blu Jazz, Lady luck, top tier, colludium, Jutamas, and so many more.
