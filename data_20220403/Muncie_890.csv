"Ball State is super far from town proper? I had to check a map, but it's pretty much in the middle of town. Plenty of drunken college students but the college students mostly stay near campus so it's true that Muncie isn't a college town. Also cheap student housing - I lucked into a whole cute little house for $600 a month and could walk to work. Granted, I got a crazy deal because it turned out to be infested with mold, but that's another story for another day. /u/Txalarmguy:  cheap student housing might be a great option for a summer place while you get to know the city and look around for a ""real"" house or apartment. I'm assuming you'd be renting, since you don't know if you like Muncie? I do agree that Muncie isn't a ""college town"" the way places like Bloomington are.  


Anway, /u/Big_Mirror1585 I agree with everything else you've said in this thread, and ""If you don't mind things being a little gritty, Muncie isn't terrible. I love it, but it's not for everyone"" pretty much sums up my experience - and works just as well for Pittsburgh, except that Pittsburgh is a real city, just not a huge one like NYC or Los Angeles.

"If you're familiar with any northeast cities, is there a city you can compare Muncie to? Is Muncie a rough city like Philly? The Bronx? Baltimore? Or even Houston and New Orleans? (Last two aren't in the northeast but I think they're shithole cities and would never wanna live in any of those. No offense to anyone from those places but they suck). If so, let me go ahead and scratch Muncie off my list lol. 

I don't mind driving in rough areas but I wouldn't want my home to be in a neighborhood where my local gas station, gym, and grocery store are in sketchy areas. 
I don't wanna have to watch my back while doing simple things like riding my bicycle, jogging, working on my car, taking out the trash, yard work, etc. 

The area of NJ I grew up in was somewhere between urban and suburban. It wasn't as nice and peaceful as nice suburban neighborhoods that were 5-10 minutes away and it wasn't as bad as the street where I got robbed at gunpoint, 5 minutes up the road from me üôÉ or the street in my town about 3 minutes away that where all the gang members would hang out. I also lived 5-10 minutes away from several project buildings. NJ sucks like that. I've seen huge, nice houses with old homeowners on one block and abandoned houses on the next block. 

If I move to the Muncie area, I'd be more interested in a house with a yard and something not so crowded.",t2_bme691fj,Txalarmguy,0,1644620296.0,0,t1_hwkje78,hwkje78,False,Txalarmguy,t3_spdo1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muncie/comments/spdo1n/whats_life_like_in_muncie/,What's life like in Muncie?,/r/Muncie/comments/spdo1n/whats_life_like_in_muncie/hwkje78/,1,r/Muncie,0,1
"I'll give you my honest assessment of Muncie as a 32 year resident of the area and as a person who spent ever summer here from 0-15years old.   My family has owned property here and lived in Muncie since 1897.   But as someone who also lived in TX and the south.... Ok.....

East Central Indiana weather is somewhat humid in the summer, but not usually over 90F.   Winter does not get below 0F very often, usually hovers in the high 20's -mid 30's.   Snow is greatly diminished over the last 20 years thanks to global warming, but it still snows some.  the 10"" we got last week is probably the one ""big"" snow for the year.   I would wager that the upper east coast probably has harsher winters.   We sorta have a wet season that starts about now and goes until May.  Summers are pretty dry normally.  Almost too dry recently.  Its not so dry you need you water your lawn though.  

Muncie was probably at its lowest point about 20 years ago.   Industry is beginning to return and will continue to do so., but it sounds like you have work taken care of.   From a housing standpoint... Stay north of the river and west of Walnut if you can.   The other side of town can be fine, it can be awful its just iffy,  The closer you are to the university the better, probably.   The rental market here is skewed because of the university, but no matter what it will be less than NYC or TX.   I'm not sure what sort of vibe you are looking for, but most of Muncie will be middle/lower middle class Chevy truck, if that makes any sense.  There are pockets of funky/artsy/ restored Victorian house types around downtown.   There is even a little shop that sells ""Keep Muncie Weird"" shirts which is comical because Austin, this ain't.  Couple of good bars downtown, couple of breweries in town as well. Wineries outside of town as well.  Nothing special, but decent.   Food here is Applebee's Chef Mike chain restaurant crap for the most part.  There are a handful of little joints around town.   I can't speak for Arabic, Indian or Asian, but I do know they exist.  Hispanic... well there are multiple Mexican places around that are all basically clones of each other.  Its ok.  Its not Tex-Mex, its not real Mexican... its all sort of beans and red sauce ""Mexican"" that is palatable to Hoosiers.   Its Ok, the places do sort of become like your local spot though as they tend to be pretty laid back places. Everyone has their favorite. There is a Chuy's and now a Torchy's of all things in Noblesville/Fishers which is as close to TX food as we get here.  Crawfish?  Well there is a place called Yats in the Village ( by the BSU) that is not half bad Cajun food.  Parking sucks despite the building being a parking garage.   Its not NOLA, but its not terrible by any means.  You can find just about anything you are looking for food wise with a quick trip down the interstate to the north side of Indy.  

Earthquakes are a theoretical possibility as we are on the New Madrid fault line.  Ive felt a handfull of trimmers in my life.  Tornadoes are a real threat, but they are much less of a threat in town though still possible.  There is a theory that the bend in the White River somehow prevents tornadoes from hitting Muncie.  Meh.  Wind gonna wind.  

Gyms?  I'm fat, I don't know.   Grocery stores?   We have 2 Walmarts ( one features bathroom meth labs!), a Meijer, a Payless ( rebranded Kroger) a Ruler (odd lots Kroger) and 2 Aldi's ( the north side Aldi is really nice).   We also have a semi- Super Target that has some food.  

Despite Muncie being a college town, it really isn't.  It's a town with a college in it.  Its devoid of most of the funky artistic vibe you might find on 6th Street in Austin or Deep Ellum.  Its just sorta an old factory town with tiny pockets of cool surrounded by boring 70's suburbs ( northwest Muncie) or the gun and knife club south of the river.   Its not awful, its just awful plain.

Muncie has great people. It‚Äôs got great potential as well. 

Like a lot of other legacy cities, Muncie still suffers from loss of population, leading to loss of jobs. It never recovered from the housing crash in 2008. It‚Äôs general population relied on unskilled labor for employment, so now it has an under trained workforce. Add to that generational poverty, self-harm, and increase population experiencing homelessness. It‚Äôs historically depressed property values have made it inexpensive place to live.

"I love Muncie. It's a great place to raise kids. The Cost of living is 12 to 14% lower than the national average, and it still has most of the amenities you would expect from a city.Here's a decent source to answer the comparison question: [https://datausa.io/profile/geo/muncie-in/](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/muncie-in/)  
The infrastructure has improved a ton in the last decade. The FBI just put most of our corrupt politicians in prison and the current administration has been on extra good behavior and things seem to be improving... although slowly. Many of the dilapidated houses have been torn down or restored in the last 7-8 years. Interestingly, several of the old limestone and brick churches have been purchased for basically nothing ([link](https://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/local/2020/12/18/first-christian-church-muncie-indiana-gets-new-life/3882654001/)), and repurposed into unique apartment units or music venues.Muncie used to be a huge hub of manufacturing but lost many of those jobs a couple of decades ago. The downsides of that are obvious economically, but the upside is that the wildlife and green spaces along the White River have rebounded. The economy never really collapsed since the University and the Ball Foundation have helped keep the community afloat with grants targeted at local businesses and the Arts. I live downtown and love it. All of the businesses downtown are locally owned and within walking distance of the river/greenway. Downtown is currently at full occupancy and there is a lot of demand to live down here, so there are several new housing projects underway. I used to live in Austin, TX and the traffic was a nightmare, the greenway was kinda green, but always packed with more people than it was built for and the cost of the amenities meant that they were pretty much useless to me as a poor single dude. Muncie on the other hand: the only traffic issues are due to construction or are train-related, the greenway is gorgeous (i didn't realize how green and lush Indiana was until I moved back from TX)... and everything is dirt cheap in comparison. For example: When I have friends that live in cities come visit, they are shocked at the fact that a pitcher of beer is cheaper than a single tall-boy where they live.

I think it's a hidden gem with a ton of upside in the future.",t2_2tg7j83u,shopptimusPrime,0,1644525054.0,0,t1_hweyqu4,hweyqu4,True,Txalarmguy,t3_spdo1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muncie/comments/spdo1n/whats_life_like_in_muncie/,What's life like in Muncie?,/r/Muncie/comments/spdo1n/whats_life_like_in_muncie/hweyqu4/,9,r/Muncie,0,9

We have a lot of Hispanic and thai resturants. Used to have several asian but not as much. It is mostly chain restaurants anymore. es are even more rare. 

We have a lot of Hispanic and thai resturants. Used to have several asian but not as much. It is mostly chain resturants anymore. 

Downtown is a growing community. The Y is downtown along with a growing arts scene and plenty of breweries and now axe throwing! Near campus you have what is called the Village, a small strip of restaurants and you could probably get gym access through Ball State.   


I would recommend buying if you can. Rent is so much higher because of Ball State renters. I was living in a 2 bedroom apartment for almost $800 with no utilities included in that. Was finally able to buy a 2750 square foot house for $54k and my mortgage is almost half of what I was paying in rent.   


We have plenty of grocery stores the problem is if you want to live in the above two mentioned areas there isn't one in walking distance. We do have a decent bus transportation system if that is needed. 

We have one super large strip called McGalliard that has all the chain stores, Target, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Hobby Lobby, McAllisters, etc.  


If you choose the downtown are you would also be close to the Cardinal Greenway which is a trail which is ""the longest rail-trail in Indiana and spans 62 miles from Marion through Muncie to Richmond in East Central Indiana"". Nearby in Dalevile is Canoe County if you would like to rent kayaks but people fish and kayak all the time on the White River which runs through the city.   


In terms of other cities we are about an hour from Indy and 1.5 from Fort Wayne, 3.5 from Chicago, 2.5 from Columbus, OH. So not too far away if you want to explore other places.

"I suggest checking out zillow rentals. I would agree with other comments about BSU rentals, BSU cribs, etc. I‚Äôd avoid the rentals right outside of campus. 

There are a good amount of rentals available from individuals who just have one or two rentals. My husband and I are an example. Landlords like us typically take better care of their properties and tenants because there are only a couple, rather than dozens. Granted, you can‚Äôt necessarily know that from a listing. We post our rentals on Zillow and got a lot of interest, so our experience is that it‚Äôs a popular rental site.

There are a lot of options, especially if you don‚Äôt want/ need to be within immediate proximity of campus or the hospital. I don‚Äôt know about the immediate vacancy for this time of year though. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a house, I suggest doing a google maps street view search to check out the area. Some properties are listed pretty cheap as far as rent goes, but might not be in an awesome area. Like any city, there are good and bad parts.

"Hicks is right. This is gimmicky. There is already an economic incentive for people from the coasts to come to Muncie, and that's our low cost of living. The problem is that it's hard to convince people to accept a low cost of living when it means accepting a low quality of life too. $7,000 is cool and all but it doesn't make up for the struggling school systems, decaying infrastructure, limited parks and opportunities for outside activity, and cultural unwillingness so many residents have to take care of their health and the health of their community.

"Damn bro, sorry you've had a bad experience but mine's been totally different. Dave's always done right by my friends and I. Took a lot a time the weekend before Christmas to help me pick out some board games for my siblings. He lets one guy I know trade in stuff he'll probably never make a profit on just 'cause he's a regular, and I think he used to give him a bit of store credit for running a public game he was gonna run anyway. It's a bit more expensive than Amazon, but I pretty much expect that from a FLGS.

He also loves talking TTRPGs; he and I were both running CoC games at around the same time so we've talked shop about that a bit. I think there's a 5e game he's running coming up here, but our game schedules never align because he has to wait until the store is closed and I spend the evenings with my family.

Biggest thing for me was that when my daughter was born, Dave set up a private lactation area in the back for my wife so she'd be more comfortable when we came to run/play games on the weekends. Putting that kind of conscious effort in to make his game shop a safe place for women is a big plus in my book. He also put in a whole section of more kid-friendly board games around the same time.

My experience has always been that Dave takes care of people.

"Here‚Äôs a copy pasta i made with some recommendations for good local stuff. I made it awhile ago when I used to live there so some things might have changed:

Cafes: The Cup, Rosebud Coffee House, The Caffeinery, Harmony Cafe, The Downtown Farmstand, Hoku Poku (bubble tea)

Bars/Breweries/Wineries: Savages, The Fickle Peach, Twin Archer, Elm St. Brewing, Be Here Now, Mark III (lgbtq), Tonnee Winery, The Guardian Brewing, Heorot/Valhalla, the Indy craft brew taproom

Restaurants:  The Neely House, Vera Maes, Lahody‚Äôs Steakhouse, and Osteria 32 are all a bit fancier. Otherwise there‚Äôs Sunshine Cafe, By Hand and Fork, Dumpling House, Tuppee Tong Thai, Fuji Sushi/Hibachi, Sitara (Indian), Chava‚Äôs is my favorite Mexican, Puerto Vallarta on Tillotson is also popular Mexican food, Sitara Indian, Amazing Joe‚Äôs and Roots Burgers are often hit or miss, Greeks in the Village has the best pizza.

Stores: I just recently discovered the Common Market and it‚Äôs pretty quirky but cute, downtown has a couple cute stores: definitely recommend checking out Muncie Map co. and just taking a walk downtown for all the little local shops around there. White Rabbit bookstore in the Village, I really like Frankie D‚Äôs Flea Market on Memorial drive for random deals, Village Green Records is a cute little record shop, the Orchard Shop at minnetrista is pretty cute and they have farmer‚Äôs markets there on Saturday mornings

Sweets: The Barking Cow is good for ice cream, and Berry Winkle has froyo (best to go on Wednesdays), Charmed Cupcakes just opened downtown and they are pretty popular as well as Sea Salt and Cinnamon which has lots of vegan options. Fresh market treats is pretty interesting and they sell their stuff at the farmers market. Lowery‚Äôs is a little bit outside of muncie but their chocolates are pretty popular. The queer chocolatier should be reopening soon in a new location downtown. 

Other stuff: The Corner Mat yoga studio is cute, Made in Muncie Pottery is fun, Madjax is a cool community center with art and events, Minnetrista is worth checking out even just to walk around but they also have a new Bob Ross experience, if you have a bike the Cardinal Greenway is really nice (I rode all the way to Richmond and I would definitely recommend it), the David Owsley Art museum and the Orchid Garden at Ball State are nice, the Prarie Creek Reservoir is nice for nature walks or kayaking (but their trails are so poorly labeled)

Also there are a bunch of events this summer like first Thursday Art Walk, Moonlight Movies/Art Reels, Summer Concerts in the park, lots of musicians at local breweries, most of those can be found on the Downtown Muncie fb page.

You could walk around downtown Muncie. Get dinner down there and then go to Barking Cow for ice cream. 

I second the farmers market on Saturday mornings, but you gotta be a morning person to make it worth it in my opinion. 

Grab coffee at Rosebud or the Caffeinery (I‚Äôm not a fan of the Cup in the Village.)

If you‚Äôre of age, you could go to Books & Brew, the Guardian, or Elm Street to grab a drink. Pre-pandemic Elm Street did trivia nights. You‚Äôd have to join a group if it‚Äôs just the two of you, but you could always go and just passively participate in trivia and not keep score. Elm Street has an underage section too, so you don‚Äôt have to be 21. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre still doing trivia now, but they have events on their website.",t2_ai5a8j5s,acciotacotaco,0,1633479985.0,0,t1_hfjojh7,hfjojh7,True,mymaloneyman,t3_q1xls6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muncie/comments/q1xls6/muncie_dates/,Muncie Dates,/r/Muncie/comments/q1xls6/muncie_dates/hfjojh7/,4,r/Muncie,0,4

"There are a couple spots for bars in Muncie. 

One is the village which has college bars like Brothers (nationwide chain bar), Roots Burger Bar, and The Chug (typical college hole-in-the-wall). It also has a large, furnished apartment complex called Village Promenade. It is 99% college students but I know a guy who was in Muncie for a year for work and they let him rent a studio. 

The other main spot for bars is downtown Muncie. A lot of bars here only serve beer, wine, and cider. If you want a bar with food some popular choices here are Savages, Elm Street Brewery (has liquor), and Twin Archers. The Fickle Peach is a good bar to meet people. They have 3 pool tables and live music outside most Friday nights during the summer. The Mark III is the gay bar in Muncie. They have frequent drag shows but when those aren't happening it can be kinda dead. There is also Valhalla (has liquor) & The Heorot. They are right next to each other with valhalla being a traditional bar and the heorot having craft beers. 

There are a lot of other places around Muncie to drink but nothing clustered like those two areas.

"Downtown is going to be a good bet, It's got good places like Valhalla, The Heorot, Mark III Taproom, and then the Commons along with other places to go. The Downtown Farmers Market is a good organic store with a good deli. South of Downtown is where the poorer side of Muncie generally lives and there can be some rough spots there but nothing too dangerous. Just don't leave your car unlocked or windows down overnight. North of Downtown and you run into Ball State and Minnetrista, which are the hubs for a lot of the city's culture. All along McGalliard you'll find every major restaurant and fast food joint. The MITS Bus  will also take you all across the city to wherever you need (within reason). Wal-Mart on W Clara (a.k.a. Wal-Mart North) is the better Big Box store between the two Wal-Marts in town. You want good groceries? Aldi's is your best friend, either north or south location. After that you'll have the Payless stores. I recommend the one on Tillotson, as it's also a part of the other eateries that run through the city along Tillotson.

The north side of Muncie offers more options as far as stores and restaurants go but there are other places around the city. On and around BSU is safe, downtown is safe depending on time. Places I recommend avoiding would be residental neighborhoods to the east, south, and downtown. Not all of these have issues but they also don't have a lot to offer so they generally aren't worth going to because it's just where people live. Use your best judgement and you'll be fine. People in Muncie are generally Midwest nice.

While I was in school I felt like BSU offered the most things to do that weren't just drinking. The village has some restaurants and bars. Downtown also has the same. There's the resivour that's a little bit out of town if you want to sit by some water. Also Muncie has quite a few parks.

I make a lot of salsa. My family owned a couple Mexican restaurants, and I'm confident that the red tomato table salsa (what you're describing) was the best I've ever had. Fortunately, I had the honor of making it when I worked there, so I picked up a few tips.

You're right. The ingredients are all the same (mostly).
- tomato
- onion
- garlic
- cilantro
- chile
- lime
- salt and pepper

The trick is to get them in the proper ratios. Over the years since my stint at the restaurant, I have devised a couple tips for making it at home. I'll go through each ingredient individually.

Tomato It's all about the tomatoes. I've tried every possible tomato configuration. What I won't use is fresh tomatoes‚Äã from the produce aisle. The seasonality and lack of consistency makes it hard to nail consistency from batch to batch. My secret is Muir Glen brand canned, fire-roasted, crushed tomatoes. They are canned in their prime, roasted to enhance the flavor. And the crushed are less watery than the diced, and have a decent amount of intact tomato to add some chunkiness. I'll often opt to make tomatillo salsa or pico de gallo if this specific canned tomato is unavailable.
Onion Speaking of chunkiness, onion. This is what I use to provide texture, instead of the tomato. Since the tomato is mostly crushed, onion gives the texture you might get if you were using fresh tomato. When mixed together, it really doesn't matter. I use red onion exclusively, or white if I can't find red. Yellow onions are just too strong, and to keep the flavor properly balanced, you lose a lot of texture. I cut them between a dice and a mince; pretty fine.
Garlic Not much to say about garlic other than it's totally essential! To make sure it is in every bite, it gets minced finely, and then crushed with that sliding knife technique all the TV chefs use.
Cilantro Don't go overboard. I use as little as just a few sprigs. You want enough to know it's there, but not enough where you really can discern its flavor. It's easy to overdo it.
Chile I prefer serrano, but will use jalape√±o as a backup. I mince it pretty finely, sometimes with the seeds, sometimes without depending on how hot I want it. It's hard to gauge because spiciness can vary from pepper to pepper, or season to season. To your favor.
Lime Try to get limes with smooth skins, a little shinier than the rest, and heavier than it looks. Again, too much can overpower things, too little leaves it tasting flat. To taste.
S&P Believe it or not, these two ingredients are as essential to my palate as the tomatoes are. Go heavy on both, but taste as you add so as to not completely overdo it. IMO, too much is better than too little. Be careful, but know that that line is further out than you'd think.
My general single-batch recipe is as follows, good enough for a small party:
- one 14oz can Muir Glen fire-roasted, crushed tomatoes
- quarter red onion, finely diced
- 1 - 2 cloves of garlic, crushed, smashed, pasted
- 6 - 15 sprigs of cilantro, minced
- half of a serrano chile, or quarter jalape√±o, minced. Seeds in or removed, your call. Add more or less to taste
- juice of 1 - 2 limes, depending on juiciness and‚Äã taste
- adequate salt and pepper. Salt, ~1tbsp or more. Pepper, using a grinder, I basically cover the bowl. Appx 1 - 1 1/2 tsp

Mix everything in a bowl, stir, and adjust taste to your favor. I usually find myself adding more chile, lime, or salt.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"I thought about that. It‚Äôs because of the shift in lifestyle expectations between 30 and 40. At 40, things start to slow down and people are less likely to adapt n√©e things into their lives. (That‚Äôs been what I‚Äôve observed/experienced) anyway. I‚Äôd like to be with someone before that landmark age so that we can apart of each other‚Äôs lives for a bit before one of us hits it. I know once I‚Äôm 40, I won‚Äôt want to date anyone under 38. 

Dating as an adult is tough enough because by the time you hit 30, you aren‚Äôt so much growing with your partner, you‚Äôre just integrating each other into your already established existence. It‚Äôs like a freshman in high school dating a senior. At 14 and 18, that‚Äôs a big gap between maturity and life experience. Once it‚Äôs 21 and 25, it‚Äôs less of a big deal.

"Here‚Äôs a copy pasta i made with some recommendations for good local stuff:

Cafes: The Cup, Rosebud Coffee House, The Caffeinery, Harmony Cafe, The Downtown Farmstand, Hoku Poku (bubble tea), Downtown Nutrition (healthy shakes/tea)

Bars/Breweries/Wineries: Savages, The Fickle Peach, Twin Archer, Elm St. Brewing, Be Here Now, Mark III (lgbtq), Tonnee Winery, The Guardian Brewing, Heorot/Valhalla

Restaurants:  The Neely House, Vera Maes, Lahody‚Äôs Steakhouse, and Osteria 32 are all a bit fancier. Otherwise there‚Äôs Sunshine Cafe, By Hand and Fork, Dumpling House, Tuppee Tong Thai, Fuji Sushi/Hibachi, Sitara (Indian), Chava‚Äôs is my favorite Mexican, Puerto Vallarta on Tillotson is also popular Mexican food, Amazing Joe‚Äôs and Roots Burgers are often hit or miss, Greeks in the Village has the best pizza. 

Stores: I just recently discovered the Common Market and it‚Äôs pretty quirky but cute, downtown has a couple cute stores: definitely recommend checking out Muncie Map co. and just taking a walk downtown for all the little local shops around there. White Rabbit bookstore in the Village, I really like Frankie D‚Äôs Flea Market on Memorial drive for random deals, Village Green Records is a cute little record shop, the Orchard Shop at minnetrista is pretty cute and they have farmer‚Äôs markets there on Saturday mornings

Other stuff: The Corner Mat yoga studio is cute, Made in Muncie Pottery is fun, Madjax is a cool community center with art and events, Minnetrista is worth checking out even just to walk around but they also have a new Bob Ross experience, if you have a bike the Cardinal Greenway is really nice (I rode all the way to Richmond and I would definitely recommend it), the David Owsley Art museum and the Orchid Garden at Ball State are nice, the Prarie Creek Reservoir is nice for nature walks or kayaking (but their trails are so poorly labeled), Charmed Cupcakes just opened downtown and they are pretty popular.

"Muncie, especially McGalliard, is chain heaven, so you will find a lot of the standard retail stores in any American city. Here‚Äôs some recommendations for good local stuff:

Coffee shops: The cup, Rosebud coffee house, The Caffeinery, Harmony Cafe, The Downtown Farmstand, Hoku Poku (bubble tea), downtown nutrition for healthy shakes

Bars/Breweries/Wineries: Savages, The Fickle Peach, Twin Archer, Elm St Brewing, Be Here Now, Mark III (lgbtq), Tonnee Winery, The Guardian, Heorot/Valhalla

Restaurants:  The Neely House, Vera Maes, Lahody‚Äôs Steakhouse, and Osteria 32 are all a bit fancier. Otherwise there‚Äôs sunshine cafe, By Hand and Fork, Dumpling House, Tuppee Tong Thai, Fuji Sushi/Hibachi, Sitara (Indian), Chava‚Äôs is my favorite Mexican, Puerta Vallarta on Tillotson is also popular Mexican, Amazing Joes is often hit or miss, Greeks in the Village has the best Pizza

Stores: I just recently discovered the common market and it‚Äôs pretty quirky but cute, downtown has a couple cute stores, I really like Frankie D‚Äôs Flea Market on Memorial drive for random deals, village green records is a cute little record shop, the orchard shop at minnetrista is pretty cute and they have farmer‚Äôs markets there on Saturday mornings

Other stuff: The corner mat yoga studio is cute, Made in Muncie Pottery is fun, Minnetrista is worth checking out and they have a new Bob Ross experience, if you have a bike the cardinal greenway is really nice I rode all the way to Richmond, the david osley (sp?) Art museum and the orchid garden at ball state are nice, the prarie creek reservoir is nice for nature walks or kayaking but their trails are so poorly labeled

This is all I can think of for now, but I might add more later!",t2_m2z63,hanananenome,0,1621941021.0,0,t1_gzdn0uj,gzdn0uj,True,coffehgirl,t3_me0eho,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muncie/comments/me0eho/new_to_muncie_help_and_suggestions/,New to Muncie!!!

"Coffee Shops: There is The Cup on University Ave, and the Caffeinery in Downtown. Starbucks is easy to find if you're on Tillotson or McGalliard

Restaurants: If you roll down McGalliard you'll run into most of the big chains. There is a neat diner called Sunshine Cafe on Oakwood, and a pretty good hole in the wall restaurant called Bazooky's on S Walnut. also Savage's in Downtown is pretty kickass

Bars: Well it depends on what you're looking for. I always recommend the Heorot in downtown, and there is a Books N Brews down on White River. The Mark III Taproom is a good place to grab a drink that's LGBTQ focused (it's the local gay bar)

Stores: depends on what you're looking for, as there are all kinds of places around town. Ole Wally World is on Clara ave and east 29th St, the 29th st goodwill is close to the Walmart.
