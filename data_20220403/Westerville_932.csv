"I moved to a new city when I was 22 and quickly realized it's so much harder to make friends as an adult than it was in college.  It's a big reason why I moved back to my hometown of Westerville (years ago.)  I'm sure the pandemic has only made it more difficult.  

My advice is to accept invitations when they're offered.  It just takes a while... 

I've been shy my whole life and I'm pretty sure I'm introverted, so I know how hard it is to make new friends, even when you're young.  

I'm not sure if you're working, but that seems like the most obvious way to meet people.  Consider a part-time job where you would interact with lots of local people.  

Maybe look into a cooking class or something like that?

"Winter has it's challenges since all of the large outdoor events are delayed until late spring - like Fourth Friday where they close State street in uptown for food/drink/vendors. 

Otterbein has a really good theatre program. If you're into shows, check those out and I imagine you'd be able to meet some people there. They do some other community oriented events too, maybe some you would be interested in. 

Check out some of the parks - Innis Wood gardens are beautiful year round. Bike/walk/skate/run any of the miles upon miles of trails and scope out other individuals doing the same thing. Local bike shops and running stores have groups that go out weekly, I've met a lot of people that way. 

Mezza used to have wine tastings and book clubs, but I'm not sure if that's still happening. The library has a lot of group activity things going on, definitely check their site for the calendar. 

I live near uptown and spend a lot of time walking around. The people here are really nice and almost anyone would have a friendly conversation if you start one up.

"Methamphetamine Labs  
Once a methamphetamine cook has collected chemicals and set up  
equipment, it doesn’t take long to make the drug—about 12 hours for  
one batch. Clandestine labs have been set up in all manner of living  
quarters, from hotel rooms and recreational vehicles to single-family  
rentals or other apartment units. Lab operators favor units that offer  
extra privacy. In rural settings barns or houses well away from other  
residences offer such privacy. In urban settings labs may be set up in  
70  
Bureau of Justice Assistance  
houses with plenty of surrounding trees and shrubs to block views of  
the interior, or apartment or hotel units that are well away from the  
view of management. However, while seclusion is preferred, clandestine  
labs have been found in virtually all types of rental units.  
Neighbors may observe the following indicators:  
❑ A strong ammonia smell. This smell is very similar to cat box odor  
and is unique to the amalgam method for methamphetamine  
production.  
❑ Other odd chemical odors. The smell of other chemicals or solvents  
not typically associated with residential housing may be present.  
❑ Chemical containers. Chemical drums or other chemical containers  
with their labels painted over may be present.  
❑ Smoke breaks. If other suspicious signs are present, individuals  
leaving the premises to smoke a cigarette may also be an indicator  
because ether, which is highly explosive, is used in methamphetamine production; methamphetamine cooks must leave the lab  
before lighting up.  
Landlords may observe the following indicators:  
❑ Strong unpleasant or chemical odors. A particularly strong cat box  
or ammonia smell within the rental may indicate methamphetamine  
production using the amalgam process. The odor of ether, chloroform, or other solvents may also be present.  
❑ Many empty containers of over-the-counter cold or allergy  
medicines. New, faster methods of “cooking” methamphetamine  
require the use of large quantities of over-the-counter cold medicines  
that contain the drug ephedrine. The average cold sufferer may leave  
one or two empty cold medicine containers in the trash. The presence  
of many such emptied out boxes, bottles, or blister packs is a definite  
warning sign.  
❑ Chemistry equipment. The presence of flasks, beakers, and rubber  
tubing like those used in high school chemistry classes in rental units  
or garbage. Few people practice chemistry as a hobby—if you see  
such articles, take it seriously.  
❑ A maroon-colored residue on aluminum windows in the unit. The  
“ephedrine process” of methamphetamine production is a more  
expensive process, but it does not emit the telltale ammonia/cat box  
odor. However, the hydroiodic acid used in the process does eat  
through metals and, in particular, the vapor of the acid leaves a  
maroon residue on aluminum.",t2_4ghdp9zj,Getoutofhere6754,0,1628871878.0,0,t1_h8ss2lh,h8ss2lh,True,Getoutofhere6754,t3_p3o2r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/westerville/comments/p3o2r9/hilltop_condo_drug_house_busted/,Hilltop condo drug house busted,/r/westerville/comments/p3o2r9/hilltop_condo_drug_house_busted/h8ss2lh/,-5,r/westerville,0,-5
"Dealing  
Drug dealers typically sell small quantities to many purchasers. Dealing  
locations are like convenience stores—high traffic locations with each  
customer buying a small amount.  
Neighbors may observe the following activities:  
❑ Heavy traffic. That is, a number of cars and pedestrians stopping at  
a home for only brief periods. Traffic may be cyclical, increasing on  
weekends or late at night, or minimal for a few weeks and then  
intense for a period of a few days—particularly paydays.  
❑ Exchanges of money. Cash and packets may be traded through  
windows, mail slots, or under doorways.  
68  
Bureau of Justice Assistance  
❑ Unknown Visitors. Visitors appear to be acquaintances rather than  
friends.  
❑ People bring valuables into the unit. Visitors regularly bring  
televisions, bicycles, VCRs, and cameras—and leave empty handed.  
❑ Waiting in cars and use of odd parking locations. Visitors may sit  
in their cars for a while after leaving a residence or may leave one  
person in the car while the others visit. Visitors also may park around  
a corner or a few blocks away and approach on foot.  
❑ Lookouts. Frequently lookouts will be younger people who tend to  
hang around the rental unit during heavy traffic periods described  
earlier.  
❑ Regular activity at extremely late hours. For example, noise and  
visitors between midnight and 4 a.m. on weeknights. (Both cocaine  
and methamphetamine are stimulants—users tend to stay up late.)  
❑ Other obvious signs. These signs may include people exchanging  
small packets for cash, people using drugs while sitting in their cars,  
and syringes or other paraphernalia left in common areas or on  
neighboring property.

&#x200B;

Distribution  
Distributors are persons who sell larger quantities of drugs to other,  
smaller distributors or dealers. They are the “wholesale” component,  
while dealers are the “retail” component. If the distributors are not taking the drugs themselves, they can be difficult to identify. A combination of the following drug sale indicators may be significant:  
❑ Expensive vehicles. Particularly vehicles owned by people otherwise  
associated with a lower standard of living. Some distributors make it  
a practice to spend their money on items that are easily moved, so  
they might drive a $50,000 car while renting an inexpensive unit.  
❑ Pagers and cellular phones. Particularly when used by people who  
have no visible means of support.  
❑ Frequent late-night trips. Many people work swing shifts or have  
other legitimate reasons to come and go at late hours. However, if  
you are seeing a number of other signs along with frequent late-night  
trips, this could be significant.  
Participant’s Manual

Keeping Illegal Activity Out of Rental Property: Participant’s Manual  
❑ Secretive loading and unloading of vehicles. Trucks, trailers, or cars  
being loaded and unloaded late at night in a hurried, clandestine  
manner. Loading and distribution houses (most likely to be found in  
border states) are essentially repackaging locations that move large  
quantities of drugs.",t2_4ghdp9zj,Getoutofhere6754,0,1628871102.0,0,t1_h8sq4ew,h8sq4ew,True,Getoutofhere6754,t3_p3o2r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/westerville/comments/p3o2r9/hilltop_condo_drug_house_busted/,Hilltop condo drug house busted,/r/westerville/comments/p3o2r9/hilltop_condo_drug_house_busted/h8sq4ew/,-6,r/westerville,0,-6

"Hi, I hope you and your brother are safe. I don’t have any insight about Franklin County’s foster system, but I read your post history, and saw that you have adult siblings. Any chance you can have them petition the courts for temporary custody?

"Westerville (Annehurst) resident here, we absolutely love it. I have 4 kids (12,12,9,7). Here's what I love about living here:

* So many parks, including Sharon Woods metropark with a pet-friendly trail and \~4 mile multipurpose loop. 
* Easy access to Polaris AND Easton areas which provide just about any commercial activity you can think of.
* Westerville is one of the few areas in Columbus with it's own dedicated utilities and civil services, so our power is always back on quickly, and our roads are plowed well in advance.
* Uptown is great. Java Central for coffee (I work from there frequently), Schneider's Bakery, Uptown Deli & Brew, Northstar Cafe, the kids love Gyros at Koblé, Whitt's Custard, Graeter's Ice Cream...I could go on and on. We used to travel to another suburb for date night, but over the years Westerville has become our favorite place to hang out.

"I just begrudgingly moved to Westerville from downtown Columbus with my wife and 7 month old this year. I was afraid I was going to be surrounded by cookie cutter homes and white evangelical Republicans but I'm in Spring Grove north and was pleasantly surprised by the diversity in my neighborhood.

Mostly everyone had been very friendly too. 


The area seems to be a 70-30 D to R political split that lives in peace.  The bike trails are amazing and every other week I find a new playground that I can't wait to take my daughter to.

"Westerville is amazing and everything you described you are looking for. Definitely a great, safe community with amazing parks and tons to do. Great rec center and good schools. Also has it's own power company, police, and fire departments so you aren't reliant on the Columbus systems that have pretty bad reputations. I have lived all around Columbus and Westerville is totally the best.

I would not recommend Bexley. It has been many years since I lived there, but it is surrounded by shit and I never felt safe there. Bexley itself is very pretty, but that part is very tiny. Any shopping or eating out will most likely be gross or frustrating. For instance, check out where to get groceries or do your banking or get your gas. I found almost everything to be a battle and it was depressing. It is closer to the city, but Westerville is only about 15-20 minutes from downtown Columbus. It is also close to tons of other neat areas like Easton. 

I think from what you are saying, you may also really like Gahanna or possibly  Dublin. A lot of people like Hilliard too, but I don't as much as the other places I mentioned for the price and what you get as a lifestyle, especially with kids, but it is pretty nice. Clintonville is cool if you like the more laid back and hipster vibe.

That is honestly the main reason I am volunteering so much time to “advertising” this situation, because I feel it’s time sensitive and if many of us don’t push this everywhere that we can, that it won’t get out there at all. I would help regardless, but I’ve honestly spent *all* of my free time volunteering digitally and I don’t think this much effort would be necessary if the news had blasted it locally immediately. 

Even the protests came in the way of search efforts, so it’s just really poor timing. Luckily, volunteers passed out fliers to all of the protestors and made the most of the circumstances and the people protesting were very kind and wanting to help. Hopefully, folks protesting will end up helping Emily because it’s a lot more people out on the streets to keep an eye out while so many folks are mostly staying home. It is best to find the blessings among all of the hardships. 

It’s interesting you mention people becoming disoriented because the only one sighting that her family feels is potentially credible was by a stranger who specifically said she was disoriented. That was within 48 hours of her disappearance, and nothing has come from it, but shelters, hospitals and other facilities are being checked regularly because of that tip.

"I have seen nothing that would indicate a purposeful disappearance because they had a great day together for Emily’s Bday on Sunday, the day/night before she is presumed to have gone missing. That all said, there is never any guarantee that there aren’t hidden problems. But— her family and closest friends are also actively involved in the search efforts to find her, so literally no one in her immediate or removed circle knows what happened or where she could be. I guess someone could be involved or being dishonest, but if that’s the case, it would then likely be nefarious and not by her wishes. 

Emily was active online and in text messages, and in photos, on her bday, just the day before she vanished. Her husband is admittedly acting a little bit odd, at least IMO, but it’s also not fair for me or anyone else to make any assumptions because anyone in the position that her husband is in would likely react poorly. I think with grief and this type of stress, especially on top of all the chaos in daily life as-is, all people would react differently and not always “normal.” 

There is video, messages and online comments that definitely present their relationship as loving, while the people closest to them regard her husband highly, just as they do her. I am skeptical, because it just all doesn’t add up, but unless proof is found, I can’t make any absolute judgements as to what happened. Her husband allowed scent sniffing dogs to come in their condo & they picked up her scent, but there were no leads from that effort, nor the searches and drones that the police used. Seeing as she was last seen alive at their home, I can’t imagine that the police/dogs would be let inside if he was involved with some sort of brutality at home. I could be wrong, of course. 

I really can’t give a definitive answer, but, all of the information that has been made public or relayed to me by those close to the situation would lead me to believe that whatever is happening is not by Emily’s choice. I also think that it would be entirely out of her character to allow so many people to be sad, sleepless and searching for her if she was hiding out — I believe she would then at least quietly inform immediate family and they wouldn’t be showing up to search daily. There was also a search team that flew in from Texas to do a search (nothing came of it), and there was a diving team spotted at Hoover Reservoir searching there as well. I cannot imagine the police would use that many resources if they felt there was a chance it was deliberate.  Again — this is just my opinion based on the information available.",t2_4zxnguc3,HumanInternetPerson,0,1591334330.0,0,t1_fsxyczv,fsxyczv,False,HumanInternetPerson,t3_gvgiu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/westerville/comments/gvgiu3/psa_emily_noble_has_gone_missing_from_westerville/,PSA: Emily Noble has gone missing from Westerville.

"Wrote the below up for another sub. Copying and pasting it here as it is updated and very detailed. Thank you to all who take a “mental” photo of her and keep your eyes out! 

Emily is the friend of my friend. This is extremely out of character for her, she wouldn’t just disappear. While the news article claims she was sighted on Monday (5/25), her husband has explained that the last 100% sighting was at their home, by him, on Sunday night (5/24). Emily and her husband had gone out to dinner that Sunday night for Emily’s birthday, as well. The alleged sighting on Monday was by the neighbor across the street. He later recanted his statement and said that he can’t be certain that is the case because he may have confused it with a prior day (he is elderly), because she does go on walks every morning. 

Emily’s husband has also explained that Emily’s sister texted her at 8 AM on Monday morning, and her sister later confirmed that the text message she sent was “marked as read” despite that she didn’t respond. This does not mean it was definitely Emily who read the text, however. Emily left home without her phone, without her car, keys or any possessions. This is not absolutely unusual if she was just going for a quick walk and planned to return home. However, she did like to have her phone with her for her nature photography. Emily’s husband had the phone for a few days before it was turned over to police. Emily’s sister may not have checked the “read receipt” until hindsight, at which point Emily’s husband may have already been poking around. 

Emily’s husband was up very late at night (not sure how late but he posted to Facebook at almost 4AM), and was thus asleep late into afternoon on Monday, so he doesn’t know what time she left (if it wasn’t in the evening/early morning) or remember anything at all from that morning. He was awake for a few hours before he began to get concerned, and he later reported her disappearance that evening (5/25).

Emily usually goes by the name “Em.” Emily’s closet is made up of mostly dark and black clothing. No one knows what she was wearing when she vanished, but they’re guessing it’s likely it was dark colored. Emily is very petite and has fair skin. In person, she does not look 52 years old, she looks younger. 

There is an active case/investigation in Westerville. Police have brought scent-sniffing dogs to their condo and thereafter did a preliminary search, which did not yield any results. They also used drones. More so, they called in a thirty party search team from Texas, I believe 15-20 people, and that was not successful, either. Numerous small searches have also been conducted in the area by friends and family, and thousands of fliers have been distributed. No leads thus far. It has been reported that one search member saw divers doing a search and rescue mission in the Hoover Reservoir, an area that Emily loved and visited and photographed often. No results. 

Emily frequented Westerville, OH & Columbus,
OH area parks. She loves nature and regularly takes gorgeous photos and posts them for others to enjoy. She is also a forager, often sharing photos of her entirely nature-picked meals. 

Other places Em frequented include: Sharon Woods, Blendon Woods, Inniswood, Alum Creek. 

Emily is kind, loving, generous and free-spirited. She has no known enemies, and many people are absolutely baffled by her disappearance.

She didn’t take anything with her (again, leading to the theory that she disappeared on her walk). Emily also likes to go hiking and take photos of nature. The police have been notified.

"That had to be frustrating when you're shopping for such an at risk child, such as yours.

Myself and my fiancée where trying to by in bulk some needed items from Fresh Thyme, Meijer, and Target all on Hamilton Rd. I recently was placed on hiatus from 1 of my 2 part-time jobs. My fiancée's job is uncertain, and if any of us catch the virus, it puts us in a tight financial position. 

I'm glad they limited some of the items, despite the shelves being empty, nonetheless. It shows their commitment to the community to make sure we all get our fair share and the doomsday hoarders don't put as much of a bind on our community as they otherwise would've. I definitely understand the older and those at higher risk buying in larger quantities than others so to limit their exposure during the peak of the outbreak.

My DM’s are open, as are, of course, the professionals at the Suicide hotline (1-800-273-8255).

"Good: 
Westerville is no longer dry! Uptown may actually have people still out and about after 9pm now. Jimmy V, Temperance Row, Koble, Good Vibes, Meza, Old Bag all serve alcohol and give the town a good amount of nightlife. Kinda on the edge of Westerville, near Cleveland Ave and Polaris they recently opened some restaurants for more options (Bru Burger, Local Cantina, Winking Lizard).

Bad: If you have to commute to downtown/campus for work, it sucks having to go down 315 or 71 in the morning especially.

Food: Try Yanni's near Cleveland Ave/270 for great Mediterranean. Massey's would probably be Westerville's staple pizza (maybe Pasquales, but their new location isn't as cool). Classic's is decent, too for the price. Lucky House or Thai Grille for Asian. Ray Ray's BBQ near Maxtown. Asterisk in uptown for people watching and a cool library/speakeasy feel.

Parks:
Sharon Woods and Blendon Woods are cool for running/walking/bike paths and Inniswoods is really well kept and pretty with lots of flowers and photographic landscapes.

During the warmer months uptown has an event every 4th friday of the month, all the shops are open, food trucks, vendors/bands around, and the streets are closed off for easy walking. There is a decently sized private college near the uptown area, Otterbein. The city itself is nicer the further north you go. Along the very southern area of westerville there are a few areas that are just ok, but head north and it gets a little nicer. It's close to two huge malls (easton and polaris).

"I live in westerville and while it’s lovely, not great for visitors; it’s an average american suburb. Easton Town Center is very close to westerville, it’s easy to kill a couple hours browsing thru the mall. 
Take a 15-20 min drive to downtownish area. 

Drinkers? Bar-hopping in Short North or Arena district. Pint-house is great for short north, great beer selection. Big Bang piano bar is my favorite bar, that’s arena district. 

Foodies? Thurmans for sure if you like greasy bar food. Dirty franks is also good for that (specialty hot-dog restaurant). 16-bit (arcade themed bar with free games so long as you’ve got a drink) is also next-door to Dirty franks, makes for a fun afternoon to grab a great lunch and walk next-door for some drinks and arcade games.  
North market is also fun to check-out. Several food vendors rent out booth’s to set-up shop and serve great street-style food. 
If you’re looking for something fancier i recommend M at Miranova, Hyde Park steakhouse or Mitchels Ocean Club. 

Groupon also has a great deal on a meadery tour at Brother’s Drake meadery, ~$25 for two, comes with several hefty drink samples and take-home mead glasses.

"If you’re looking to stay in Westerville, I’ve got four spots you should check out:

Asterisk - an eclectic restaurant that shouldn’t be missed.  If you like tea, they have an awesome afternoon tea that includes finger sandwiches, desserts, and tea for $15.  The food is all outstanding.

Barrel & Boar - a BBQ gastropub.  Great BBQ, great beer list.  Come hungry...they’ll fill you up.  It’s a little pricy, but totally worth it if you’re visiting.

Graeter’s Ice Cream - great Ohio-based ice cream shop.

Westerville Library - consistently ranked in the top 10 libraries in the United States.  Great way to spend some time.


Outside of Westerville, but nearby, I’d recommend:

Pins Mechanical - duckpin bowling, darts, lawn games, ping pong and pinball.  And fantastic drinks.  Better in the summer, but still great in the winter.

16-Bit Barcade - retro arcade in a great bar.  All the games are free (except pinball.). Very popular for good reason.

Molly Woo’s - modern American-Asian food.  One of my favorites.

Thurman’s- the biggest, tastiest burgers you’ll ever have.  Seriously.

Swenson’s - quite possibly the best fast-food burger ever created.  Served at a drive-in restaurant.

Barley’s Brewpub - great food, beers made in-house.

COSI - if you’re with kids (and even if you’re not) this science center will amaze you.  If you like science at all, it’s probably worth the visit.


This only scratches the surface, but it’s a good starter list for sure.  Have fun, and welcome back to Ohio!!

"> On Wednesday, June 13, 2018 – Beekeeping for kids sounds a little risky but there’s no risk in taking your kids to the library to learn about an essential aspect of nature. There may be greater risk in taking them to the courtyard in front of city hall where Westerville Parks and Recreation begins installing “The American Issue,” a statue representing the divisions brought about by Prohibition. Explaining that is absolutely more dangerous than the sting of a bee. Better yet, take them to the Community Center Wednesday night for the second discussion about converting the McVay home property into a new city park. It is probably more soothing to visit the Wednesday Farmers Market where strawberries and maple syrup are plentiful, No explanation needed.
