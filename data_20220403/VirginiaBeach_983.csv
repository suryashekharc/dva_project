During the season, we maintain our own pool and tub. We take water samples to them for free testing, they tell us exactly what to do each time. We buy the chemicals from them and this arrangement works well for us.

"I think you‚Äôll find like-minded people at the oceanfront. We are active folks with lots of yoga studios, smoothie bars, organic markets, etc. The boardwalk is super friendly by day but can be a big party at night during the summer. That‚Äôs really the only ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù time. Typically the incidents that make the news are one-off‚Äôs with some ass-hat who brought their gun into a bar (this is illegal, in & of itself) and got in some dispute. So long as you aren‚Äôt in or near the dispute, which usually means you‚Äôre out bar hopping during a busy event or summer night, you‚Äôre fine. This is true of many big cities,  but our crimes rates are overall good. Not sure you‚Äôll land in a luxury high rise at this monthly rate, but it could get you a nice 1 bedroom blocks from the oceanfront if you‚Äôre savvy & persistent enough. Places off Laskin or Birdneck road may be more affordable and that‚Äôs still biking distance to the boardwalk and off many options for resources within biking distance or a cheap uber for a big grocery run that won‚Äôt fit a basket.

"Virginia Beach is a great choice. We have people from all over the world here, and the majority of them are great people. When you live here year round, you learn how great the local scene is with the restaurants, music, people, etc. 

Of course, since we're the biggest city in Virginia and have much more (and nicer) things than a lot of the places around us, we get a lot of hate from outsiders who think we're all snooty, when that's only the case for maybe 1% of the people here (the ultra rich). 

Another thing you'll here is false claims by clueless people saying Virginia Beach is dangerous. It isn't even remotely in the vicinity of dangerous. We have almost half a million people here, and have one of the lowest crime rates in the country for cities over 50k people. We're consistently ranked as one of the safest cities in the country, one of the best places to live, and one of the best cities to raise a family. The ""it's getting dangerous"" bs started due to a couple of incidents the past two years where each involved multiple shootings. That is extremely rare in Virginia Beach. I've been here all 42 of my years, that's not a thing here.

"As a recent Bayside alumni, academically I think Bayside is a good high school. I was not in the health sciences program, so I can give you an outlook into the studies as a zoned student.

Pros: Bayside offered all the standard AP courses and Dual-Enrollment courses that helped my transition to college. They offer the standard classes that any other high school in VB offers. 

Cons: There are fights. Often. The security there are sometimes slow on the uptake. Skipping is widespread because, again, security is very slow. 

At the end of the day, all schools have their ups and downs. From experience, I mentored a high school girl who was getting bullied at Kellam because she was Pilipino with darker skin and that school is predominantly white.

"It was just before the pandemic, but I added that note in reference to what rawr_gunter said about South Norfolk. I doubt Uber drivers are suddenly rushing out there in a post-pandemic world‚Ä¶ which could make feasibility of going there complicated. Particularly if people like to drink. Not saying that is fair or correct, just correlating an anecdote to a comment. 

I‚Äôm all for scenes growing and expanding. Why would you assume I‚Äôm not for it and why are you calling it ‚Äúour scene‚Äù like you‚Äôre gatekeeping it? I just found it a little odd that you mentioned the same venue in every single reply‚Ä¶ and are doing so in other subreddits.

"I have never lived there and I am younger but I work in a field that has me there semi-frequently and interacting with certain residents at length. I have probably worked with around 15 individuals there and they all seem to have liked it. The staff that are there seem to care about the residents and assist them as able while emphasizing that it is not an assisted living.
I will say it is a massive complex so lots of different types of people. I have always wondered how a private introvert type would do in a building like this. 
I have seen apartments in varying conditions but I think a lot of that is dependent more on the resident than the complex. I have always been given the impression any maintenance issue gets addressed without difficulty.

"Considering that if you get FiOS in your home they install the box to bring fiber from the curb to your home your statement is absolutely incorrect. FiOS does not use any of your home's existing infrastructure. Your 20-30 year old home does not make any bit of difference, but even if it did the rates of loss/noise in the short transmission from your house to the curb versus your data travelling all across the country via coax are so small as to not be relevant. Whereas your data travelling over fiber across the country would make a HUGE difference.   


It's very simple, copper versus fiber. Your PC, your Roku, etc. use copper, so those will typically make the biggest difference when it comes to internet speeds. Whether you tac on a bit more copper between your house and the curb isn't going to make much of a difference.

Beach police do not self report, they tend not to do any investigative work on non-homicides, they perjure themselves in court and provide false evidence

I have been victimized by 5 felonious violent crimes in my 25 years here in vb, and had the perpetrator still on scene for all but one of them, I have never seen a day in court unless I saw the magistrate directly, because the police did not even report a crime and the only time they did, which was a time when somebody didn't like something a girl I was with did and pulled me out of a vehicle by the hair to try and fight me, it was reported as us both battering each other, cop said it was mutual combat which is not a legally recognized thing in VA outside of a ring and a contract

"Actually it does.  Those short runs from the POP to the modem and/or devices would not significantly degrade performance.  One way to look at it is to turn it around.  If you had fiber in your house but the network feeding it was based on twisted pair or even coax the fiber would be of marginal value--the network performance would not improve.  

The advantages of fiber over coax are based on several factors: throughput; s/n; power requirements and distance among others.  Simply put fiber has more bandwidth, less noise, requires less power and can go much further without amplification. Amplifiers add noise and degrade signal.  It also has much greater redundancy.   In commercial distribution plants internal wiring is largely fiber but it would be cost prohibitive in a residential setting and far beyond the requirements of residential users (unless you are crypto mining).",t2_cmy49,lindenb,0,1648750391.0,0,t1_i2vmr4l,i2vmr4l,False,Bootsde,t3_tsq7uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tsq7uj/moving_to_area/,moving to area,/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tsq7uj/moving_to_area/i2vmr4l/,2,r/VirginiaBeach,0,2

"No, I ran a data center in downtown Norfolk.  The earlier comment was an admittedly slight attempt at humor.  As an addendum, while Verizon does have more fiber to the curb than Cox, the Cox backbone infrastructure is much more robust.  Verizon, like many of the Bells has had to contend with a legacy of twisted pair and a topology that was not well suited to incremental improvement hence their reliance for a long time on DSL and ADSL.  Cox invested heavily in this market in building out its backbone and has been slowly replacing coax to the curb with fiber so while I might prefer Verizon residential services for all the reasons we discussed, they would not be my first choice for commercial service.  

As an aside, I had an opportunity to work for Bell Atlantic, Verizon's predecessor, shortly after the development of DSL which at the time they believed was going to give them a leg up over cable.  When I interviewed for a senior position their engineering guru, (a phone guy) gave me a short course in how DSL worked because at that point in time it was right out of the labs.  After he got done explaining it I asked him how they intended to address all the rump circuits, amplifiers and noise they were bound to find in any extant deployment.  He was silent--and I had the impression it was not a question they had spent any time on.  In fact those very issues led them to develop ADSL a few years down the road as real world conditions showed that the S/N was unworkable in communities with older plant.  I did not take the job as it became clear to me that their senior technical team were largely telephone folks with a very limited understanding of networks. Even ADSL proved limited and wonky--which is what ultimately led them to adopt a Fiber solution and gave birth to FIOS.  It is a great example of the way in which sunk investment in a legacy infrastructure led to a poor choice.  If the cable guys had been faster to move Verizon would have been a very distant competitor--as indeed many other former Bell companies are, but the cable guys were complacent as well and did not want to invest the enormous sums it takes to change out their networks.  But in those days both considered ISP revenues a bonus and content and telephony their respective primary businesses.  Had they more accurately forecast we might have had real competition and US broadband would be much further along than it is today.  If you look at S. Korea or even Vietnam where the existing infrastructure was terrible or simply did not exist, they just built out modern infrastructure from the get go and almost anyone can have affordable broadband and 5g mobile.",t2_cmy49,lindenb,0,1648745227.0,0,t1_i2v95r0,i2v95r0,False,Bootsde,t3_tsq7uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tsq7uj/moving_to_area/,moving to area,/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tsq7uj/moving_to_area/i2v95r0/,1,r/VirginiaBeach,0,1

"Glad you have had a good experience.  I am not advocating for one or the other and agree my experience with both is anecdotal.  That said, in most of VB you can choose which provider you wish to use and IMO that should not be the overarching rationale to buy one house over another.

VB is definitely the best place to live in Hampton Roads. And I should know because I've lived everywhere from Williamsburg to Norfolk to Virginia Beach...over the past 50 years.  From the best schools to lower taxes to natural beauty in our vast parks and beaches and boardwalk, to the lowest crime rates in the Region (and one of the very lowest rates in the entire US for our size)...to abundant amenities both cultural and recreational, VB is THE place to be.

As far as neighborhoods, how 'bout we talk about where you should be looking, instead of avoiding? In the Northern and Eastern parts of the City:  Shore Drive on the Chesapeake Bay between First Landing State Park and the Lesner Bridg. Then there is Baylake Pines, Chick's Beach, Church Point. Heading back East, you have the North End, Bay Colony/Linkhorn Park, Old Beach, South End, Croatan, Birdneck Point, Linlier, Hilltop,  Alanton/Baycliff, most all of Great Neck (especially North). A little further West lies Kings Grant, Little Neck, Thoroughgood, Thalia, Haygood. In the Center of the City:  KEMPSVILLE (this is a huge and diverse area of maybe 170K people!). In the vast (land-wise) Southern part of the City: Princess Anne Road, Pungo, Blackwater  (rural), Courthouse area, Landstown and Redmill areas (now developed),,,,,and many more.  (Perhaps ""avoid"" some parts of Lynnhaven, Green Run,  and in the Western areas of Newtown Road, Diamond Springs.)",t2_78rcvdt1,ResearchBig9264,0,1648737651.0,0,t1_i2upin0,i2upin0,True,Bootsde,t3_tsq7uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tsq7uj/moving_to_area/,moving to area,/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tsq7uj/moving_to_area/i2upin0/,1,r/VirginiaBeach,0,1

I ended up doing it myself since they only run cables outside the house, but still FiOS has been amazing service wise for quite some time. 

To add, the internet is so vital to how many people interact with the world these days that it is definitely a factor when purchasing your home. More people work from home these days than ever before, and anyone who worked remotely during COVID lockdowns could identify their co-workers with shoddy internet with ease.

"While I applaud the many thoughtful suggestions, perhaps we could give you better advice if you said something about what you are looking for.  Here are a few questions that might help:

What kind of experience do you want, urban, suburban or rural?

Will you be commuting, if so to where?

What particulars do you have about your new home--size, bedrooms, baths, yard?

What is your price range?

Do you have a preferred style home, e.g. ranch, split, cottage etc. ?

As OP said there are many good neighborhoods each with its own character, only a few that you would want to avoid but the borderline in some cases is close--higher end homes just a few blocks from an impoverished neighborhood.  And you may want to think about your prospective neighbors.  I don't mean to drag politics into it but some neighborhoods tend to lean one way or the other and that can affect your experience.  We live in one that has changed over time and unfortunately spun in a direction where we have only one or two neighbors with whom we can relate. That may or may not matter to you, but if it does you should ask your realtor.  

Finally, the cox versus verizon issue might matter to some (judging by the thread)-but having run a large web development shop for many years and had experience with both I cannot say that there is a clear benefit to one over the other.  I have had good and bad experiences with both.  Verizon has a fiber overbuild to the curb, Cox is mainly coax.  But what matters is customer experience, tech support, and reliability-something at which both providers do not excel. Pricing isn't that much different either--they take turns with one a bit cheaper than the other but over time it evens out.  I have Cox currently and have had exactly three outages lasting longer than a few minutes in as many years.  I have required their tech support twice--one of which was addressed immediately the other required escalation to a tier 3 tech.  When we had Verizon in a different home we had a number of outages--some lasting longer as they involved fiber repair, and their tech support was dreadful but that is the nature of tech support these days--tier 1 techs read from a script, know very little and most problems will necessitate escalation for anything but the most minor of issues.

Virginia Beach can be like a poor suburb if you're in the wrong neighborhood.  Not as bad as Portsmouth, which is like ghetto suburb throughout, but not that far from it either. But poor residents in Virginia Beach do benefit from better infrastructure the city provides meaning better retail and a better experience overall.  So you can fool yourself into thinking you're living the life because you can shop, work and play alongside upper class people.

From a noise ordinance side, during the day, they would need to exceed 65 dBA measured at least 4 ft away from ceiling. Considering the sporadic nature of the noise, may prove challenging for police to capture it. 

If I were you, I‚Äôd buy a decibel sound meter anyway to hold up while recording (just make sure it‚Äôs dBA). Even if the decibel meter shows less than 65‚Ä¶ it could help your case with your apartment complex. May even be a specific dBA number in your lease that you now have documented as a violation. If it‚Äôs over 65, well.. give non-emergency a go and get a copy of the report. 

Def add the camera as a quick open widget on your phone‚Äôs Lock Screen so you don‚Äôt even need to bother with an app. All phone types stamp the date/time in metadata of videos/photos. 

Keep going up the chain with your property managers (in writing) and keep compiling the evidence (videos, police reports etc). Are there any other neighbors on your floor who hear them too? Get them to email the complaint as well.

"My girlfriend has been dealing with the exact same issue for almost the same time frame. Ever since her upstairs neighbors moved in its been insane. She's recorded video after video of what sounds like someone slamming an encyclopedia on the floors repeatedly for hours on end. She's tried notes on the door and talking with the leasing office, but not much came about the leasing office confronting them about the excessive noise. (The people in question said it was they toddler learning to walk, which if thats thr case this kids sounds like a 300lbs heavy lifter). She ended up calling the non-emergency police and she's had peace for a couple nights now.

I'd recommend doing the same. Take videos of the noise for documentation, note durations, etc. If your complex has security, get their number and call them with the complaints in addition to the non-emergency number. Also, speak to the property manager. Not one of the desk jockeys. Document what they say and hold them accountable. They are supposed to enforce the lease and the clause of reasonable peace is a part of that lease. If they refuse to do something, keep documenting. Get ahold of someone from their corporate office (if it's Breeden or the like) and present everything to them. Going up the ladder is about the only thing you can do aside from seeing what you can do legally. The lease is a contract between renters and landlords, and they are not enforcing and upholding their part of the agreement.

I really feel for you as it's rage inducing to not be able to sleep, work, or go about your day with obnoxious neighbors. I also had to deal with this crap in the past, and is why I hate Breeden with a passion as they are the worst when it comes to property management.

"Welp, er...too bad we're a seafood town! :) But you can easily avoid it. For Norfolk, try Waterside, Nauticus, The Battleship Wisconsin, MacArthur Center (Mall), Granby Street, Ghent, the Neon District--all located right in or very near Downtown Norfolk. The Hermitage is a cool old house on the waterfront that is also a museum. Also, the Chrysler Museum is amazing, 225K sq ft on two levels (so plan your time accordingly), as are the free glass blowing demonstrations across the street at the Perry Glass Studio (affiliated with the Museum). The Norfolk Botanical Gardens are a true delight! For VB, try the Virginia Aquarium, Fort Story, DeWitt Cottage, The Life Saving Museum, The Historic Houses...more inland. For shopping and eating, try Laskin Rd, Hilltop, Shore Drive (Chesapeake Bay), The Oceanfront (Atlantic and Pacific Aves and the numbered streets)....and the happening and young Vibe District near 15th and 17/18th streets and the Oceanfront area. IF you are outdoorsy, First Landing State Park, Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge and False Cape State Park (Plus adjacent Sandbridge Beach which is more like the Outer Banks of NC) are beautiful this time of year.

The first 3 miles are the best as it takes you through downtown and passes through the historic Freemason District. You also get beautiful views of Portsmouth and some shipyards.

"If you can't keep them and aren't able to properly vet homes for them, contact [Virginia Beach SPCA](https://vbspca.com/surrender/). They will help make sure they are vaccinated, neutered, and adopted into homes that are well suited for them. They can also help you get the mother spayed through their affordable neuter programs. They may have contacts with rescues or individuals who can help you find a place for the puppies.

Its really important to make sure the puppies are healthy, vaccinated, and going to good homes. If you choose to sell them, please do it with their best interest at heart and make sure you know/trust the people, visit their homes, etc. Ask your personal network first. Try to avoid craigslist, FB market, etc. so you don't get 1) scammed and 2) sell to someone who has bad intentions/shouldn't have a pet. Ask lots of questions about how the pet will live (inside, crate trained, etc.) 

I would contact the SPCA first - if nothing else they can give you more detailed information on what to look for in new homes. Its more important they find good homes, than it is too make money off them. They can also help you prevent another unplanned litter.

"Just pulled up old quote - there was some reason we got a discount but I can't remember why - might have had to do with the material? They offer military but it wasn't that. For 1,900 square feet, we paid approximately $2,700 in labor + $10,100 in materials ($8,200 for carpet/$1,700 for the pad/$200 freight) minus the $1,500 discount, we spent about $11,300. 

We only got one other quote, and the labor was more expensive.  Labor costs I listed also included haul away of old stuff, moving furniture, and the work for the two staircases we had done. The carpet I picked was well over $4/square foot, so you can save a few bucks there lmao. Doing the math, our labor costs were like $1.42/square foot, material costs like $5.31/square foot.

"We used [Cherry Carpet](https://cherrycarpet.com/), they're based in Portsmouth but service all of 757. They have tons of options, and would definitely work with a budget if you told them you were looking to spend X amount. For instance, we knew exactly what carpet we wanted, didn't really care about the cost, but the rep suggested going for a lower pile on the stairs to save a few bucks - no one could tell, and it was a great idea. Even though we knew which carpet we wanted, the rep did a great job verifying it would be a good fit for us (asking about pets, dislikes about old carpet, etc.)

They're supper efficient and easy to work with, respond quickly, and install was awesome. Their showroom is beautiful, so if you don't know what you want yet, pay them a visit!

"Whether you actually need this is a question.  It depends in part on when your home was built.  Pre-1980 copper and cast iron were used and they tend to stay relatively sound after many years underground as long as they are not near trees with extended root systems.  Dupont (I believe) began making a plastic based alternative to copper for water lines in the 80's and it was a disaster, decaying rapidly and causing major leaks only a few years after installation.  If memory serves there was a class action suit and Dupont had to reimburse the cost of replacement.  Most municipalities banned its use thereafter.  So anything built recently--say from the mid 90's on is likely to be good. Also check with neighbors, if more than one have had issues in the past it makes sense to have coverage, but I would check my home owners insurance carrier first to see if it is already covered and if not ask about the cost of adding it rather than having to deal with a 3rd party.",t2_cmy49,lindenb,0,1648042994.0,0,t1_i1sl21x,i1sl21x,True,IAskDumbQuestions999,t3_tkh3ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tkh3ac/watersewer_line_insurance/,water/sewer line insurance,/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tkh3ac/watersewer_line_insurance/i1sl21x/,1,r/VirginiaBeach,0,1
