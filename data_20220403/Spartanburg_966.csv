"Nope, don’t think that. Dr maiolo (the previous owner of ark) killed several animals and covered it up. He allowed techs to perform surgery and when it came to getting paid? He didn’t take staff taxes out because 🤷🏻‍♀️ so several employees in 2019 had to pay that back when they were supposed to be getting returns. One time, a small dog came in at 5 pm after being attacked by another larger dog and his chest cavity was ripped open. Dr Maiolo wrapped it and sent them home, no referral to er or specialty or even pain medications to go home. There was another instance where the dr was shaving a patient and it fought it, so the dr smacked it in the face with clippers and the patients eye popped out. Dr maiolo was under investigation for these and much much more. It is a godsend that he sold the clinic and he sold it to a wonderful doctor.

My point is, I am sick of people saying the new management is worse than the old because the old was 0 management and a lazy doctor who should’ve retired years ago. 

The new management bought the clinic March 2020 and there was definitely some hiccups in wait times, price changes, etc. The clinic is still owned by husband and wife, and the prices went up but it is still cheaper than everywhere around here.

"Hi, I’m posting this with my alternate account because I’m a vet tech in the area and want to stay anonymous. 

Ark is probably the best suggestion here. Dr Lon and dr hansche are both great vets. There was a time (before dr Lon owned the practice) that there was a lot of misconduct and fuckery going on but since then quality of care is much much better doctor wise. Dr lon is a very smart and caring vet and will go the extra mile for your pet. I no longer work there due to burn out. The downside to this vet is that the techs make less than $15/hr and work more than 40 hours a week, often no lunch break. The techs are exhausted, the doctors are good. 

Stay far away from smith animal hospital and westside hospital. I interviewed at westside and the entire time I was there I saw a tech performing oral surgery on a cat (a dental with teeth extractions. Illegal for techs to do, especially unlicensed) no dr in site, and she kept that animal on the highest anesthesia setting (a 5, when you normally want to keep them at a 1.5-3 depending on how awake they are for my non medical peeps) 

Smith animal hospital is negligent. Owned by an old dr set in his own ways. I’ve seen animals come in to one of the upstate emergency vets that couldn’t breathe, one had an extreme heart murmur and they blamed it on the dogs throat so that was cool. I could go on and on with examples from them, I don’t know how they’re still open. 

Healthpointe has good doctors but beware they are owned by corporate. This means that the prices are going to be sky high. 

Eastside is also a good place to go, they have multiple friendly doctors and take only walk ins, so beware on that point but other than that they’re pretty great.",t2_3q0k6omp,Princessharkbait,0,1647570764.0,0,t1_i13s21m,i13s21m,True,pastel-mouse,t3_tgfter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spartanburg/comments/tgfter/vet_hospitals/,Vet Hospitals?,/r/Spartanburg/comments/tgfter/vet_hospitals/i13s21m/,2,r/Spartanburg,0,2

"I know it's human nature to blame the vet when pets die, but...

Smith's mishandled my cat's cancer very badly and claimed they would need to look into an oncologist referral, as it turned out there is one in Greenville they use frequently. Those bastards strung my girl along for almost 6 months. I feel like given that time frame we could have saved her or made her time more comfortable if we'd been able to get a referral in time, rather than be strung along pumping Lasix in her. In fact out of the 4 cats I took to Smith's in the last 2 years, 3 are dead.

To show I'm not just blaming the vet, I have another that I recently took to Heartland in Boiling Springs. This kitty turned out to be much sicker than we thought, and due to the severity we chose to euthanize. I appreciated the honesty and  compassion that was shown during the situation and I plan to give Heartland a  try for my next wellness visit.

It really hurts to say that about Smith's since we had been a customer for years back in the 80s and 90s before we moved out of the area.

"We have the feeling of not being in a city with a sizeable population while still being in a city with a sizeable population. We have hiking trails, big city amenities, a proper downtown, a proper mall, and a lot of nearby schools, both undergrad and grad alike. If you want to try it, we have it, or we're in driving distance of it: escape rooms, ziplining, parks, trails for biking, a ninja warrior course, even mountains. We have a pretty nice airport. You feel rural while at home but are ten minutes from any major thing you can imagine in most places. And, we're home to Denny's, the Beacon, and the Papa's Breakfast Nook. You want to see big name bands and comedians? Kansas is coming here in June. Bon Jovi and Weird Al are touring at a couple places within two hours.

If you have a car you can bring, that would be good. Most cheap shopping will be on the Eastside (Publix/Walmart) or Westside (Target/mall/best buy) of town.

 There's plenty to do within walking distance. Downtown is about four blocks from the main entrance of WofPark.

"I've lived here for most of my 33 years and I've always lived in areas that this sub will call undesirable on the west side and now on the north side. I've never really been a victim of a crime except for two stolen car stereos years ago. If you don't hang around with the ""criminal element,"" you will be fine.


I work for a company that has locations in all of the other cities you mentioned. They determine salary ranges by area (rural, metro, urban, etc etc). I would definitely make the same thing in Asheville and Greenville, not sure about the others. We live cheap so we can afford to play--I was lucky enough to buy a 2 bed/2 bath house for $55k in 2017. That will not happen now, all of the cheap housing is being bought up like crazy and rented out for $1k+. However, one of my coworkers was lucky enough to buy new construction for $100k early in 2021. It's in kind of a rough area, but gentrifying. 


I think we have a great education selection here in Spartanburg. I'm an SCC alumni (its free right now too! Not sure how long that will last) and I also attended USC Upstate. We also have Spartanburg Methodist (private 2 year), Wofford, and Converse. You can't forget that we also have the college of osteopathic medicine AND a chiropractor college (I think it's like 1 of 8 in the US). 


I don't have older kids, so can't speak much on the teenager part. I do have a cousin at Chesnee High and she is always doing some sort of activity or another through school. I will say you should carefully consider how far you are away from the high school if you are looking at buying in District 6. Dorman is in a location that is very far away from a lot of the district. It puts you in a bad position--either you will have your teenaged drivers on the interstate daily just to go to school, or they might be on a bus for 45min+.


I will admit that we find ourselves going elsewhere usually for ""recreation,"" but I think we would do that even if we lived in a more active city.

"I'm a transplant and I think Spartanburg is great. As others mentioned there are several colleges. Crime is localized, just as it usually is in other places. Downtown and other places I frequent feel very safe. I've seen news reports about new housing developments, which tells me the economy is growing. Real estate is competitive like most places right now. Rent seems high for this area, compared to previously renting in cities in the Midwest. In terms of things to do for teenagers, there's typical stuff like bowling, movies, go karting. Also a skate park and some bike trails. Probably more that I'm unaware of.

I haven't lived in Greenville, so I can't give the fairest comparison, but I'd say the big advantage of Spartanburg over Greenville is the cost of real estate and traffic. Real estate prices seem cheaper in Spartanburg. You can still find houses under $200k, but those appear to be a tougher find in Greenville. And Greenville traffic always feels insane. I don't know how people regularly commute on Woodruff road.",t2_ywd2n,shoegal23,0,1641754059.0,0,t1_hry4rnk,hry4rnk,True,northernboundary,t3_rzvs9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spartanburg/comments/rzvs9y/what_is_it_like_to_live_in_spartanburg/,what is it like to live in Spartanburg?,/r/Spartanburg/comments/rzvs9y/what_is_it_like_to_live_in_spartanburg/hry4rnk/,8,r/Spartanburg,0,8

"Spartanburg is cheaper and smaller than the places you listed. It also has a lot of crime but that’s somewhat located in certain parts so it’s skewed. There are a good many high schools and colleges, the upstate has one of the highest densities of colleges. Economy is somewhat spilled over from Greenville and Greer.

"That department is small but I think relatively well regarded. It's a small school with fairly low diversity in a small southern town so you have to account for all that that entails. Spartanburg is quite pleasant though, albeit without a ton to do unless you drive to Greenville or Charlotte. The career services center used to be fairly minimal, but it may have improved. 

I wouldn't say it's particularly famous for anything, as it's definitely a regional school. Wofford sends a disproportionate amount of students to grad schools, especially law school, so you may say they're ""known"" for that. 

The school is small and the professors are very accessible, so your best bet is probably to just call the accounting/finance department and ask to set up an appointment to speak to a professor. Or you can go through the admissions department of course. I'm sure any professor would be happy to chat with you.

By the way, it's Wofford College. It doesn't have a graduate program, so it isn't a university.",t2_4fr8h,AustinMiniMan,0,1640695859.0,0,t1_hq9sskk,hq9sskk,True,[deleted],t3_rq9k2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spartanburg/comments/rq9k2x/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Spartanburg/comments/rq9k2x/deleted_by_user/hq9sskk/,6,r/Spartanburg,0,6

Also be mindful that one person's definition of flooding is having water standing in large puddles after alot of rain, while another's is all over flooding. 🤷‍♀️

"You should also go straight to those sources for information yourself. Call DHEC about the septic systems. Call the County about zoning. Call a flood insurer about the flood zoning. We can assist you as agent, but due diligence is really to be done to the buyer's satisfaction so that we can't be held liable if something changes. If you can't perk the septic, you can always try an engineered system. They're more expensive, but that's generally a way around the traditional septic systems. As far as flooding foes, you can search the flood maps online through FEMA yourself. Flood maps were update in January, so there's a lot of conflicting info. And the taxes you're referring to are rollback taxes. If you change the use from agricultural to any other use, you or the seller will be liable for the balance between the agricultural rate and new rate.

"Yeah, not sure I understand all the hate either. I moved here from Columbia about 4 years ago and I love it. I live right outside the city in the Inman/Boiling Springs area. Its tough to say which areas are better or worse because things can change and it all depends on what you're looking for (small quiet neighborhood for socialization or simple quiet place to live). Just be smart and do your research - drive through the area both day and night and try to get a feel for what its like and if it matches what you're looking for.

"Did you find a house yet? We had a similar problem. Houses were going in hours. We'd make appointments, but they sold before we could even view the house. Good news is the market has really slowed down now compared to summer! In fact a lot of the houses that sold in a few hours must have fallen through, because they're back on the market.

Here are some tips we learned:

* Pay ALL closing costs. Sellers will sell for 20k less to someone who will pay the 5k closing costs. Go figure.
* Don't bother with FHA. No way you're getting FHA for that price, and sellers don't want to fix shit.
* Expect the house to need some work for your budget.
* Limit inspections to language like “inspection is for informational purposes only, unless a significant health or safety issue is uncovered.” this way, the seller has comfort that you are not coming back with a laundry list of minor items to fix.
* Use an escalation clause to immediately outbid an offer that's only 1-2k over yours
* Closing date: if they're currently still in the home, give them up to 60 days to move. They like that.
* Use an appraisal shortage gap if you can afford it, just in case the appraisal comes back under your bid.",t2_ggc8c,isaidputontheglasses,0,1633059899.0,0,t1_hexpicp,hexpicp,True,[deleted],t3_ntyh6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spartanburg/comments/ntyh6a/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Spartanburg/comments/ntyh6a/deleted_by_user/hexpicp/,1,r/Spartanburg,0,1

"So, part of the issue is that 29301 is absolutely huge. Think about Warren H Abernathy. It's 29301 all the way past Texas Roadhouse (includes the Woodland Heights neighborhood which is that old neighborhood going towards downtown) and also all the way to the next red light AFTER Target. It also covers the neighborhoods of Arcadia, Fairforest, Saxon, and Una. They all have their own post offices with unique zipcodes, but they are technically considered part of 29301 as well because the local post offices don't do mail delivery and their addresses are still Spartanburg 29301. As a point of reference, these are the neighborhoods between Warren H Abernathy and 85 Business between Target and downtown.


Westview is relatively crime free and the nice subdivisions off of Willis Rd are included in that. Your new friends are probably referring to the Fairforest, Arcadia, Saxon, and Una areas. I grew up on that side of town and I have to disagree with them. It really isn't a bad area at all as long as you aren't doing bad things. Most of the crime in that area is drug related. Don't do drugs. Don't associate with people who do drugs. Don't fuck with your neighbors that do drugs.

"Is the ballet company located in the city?

Some folks will agree while others will disagree about which parts are better. Blackstock Rd is the main shopping hub with the mall & Costco. They also have your Lowes & Home Depot stores. The east side while they don't have the mall still has Lowes, HD, etc. It's only 20 min to get to the mall from the east side. It's a little more rural which is what we like. We bought a single level ranch house & 5 acres over there. Nice and quiet at night. No light pollution either.

Downtown is cute and simple. If COVID wasn't an issue I'd suggest checking everything out immediately. Lots of different restaurant & bars.

He said it was pretty rough on the body in general, lots of people had thier knees go out after a decade or so.

They strung him along, they rarely actually hired people as BMW employees preferring to keep them as contractors and holding out employment like a carrot on a stick.

Many of us here at the r/Spartanburg subreddit have formed an active discord community. 

We welcome absolutely anyone and everyone who'd either just like to chat or get to know the area.

We have asked the admins/mods of r/Spartanburg to sticky the perma-link to the top of the page, but they have not responded to any of those requests. Therefore, we have to post a new link every 5 day because the old one will have expired.

I switched from charter to att and prefer it. I Also have fiber optic cables that are way faster than what I ever had with charter. I have att cable as well but since I have an LG tv there’s no cable app so it requires a cable box or screen cast with your iPhone and it is buggy when you use it with on demand shows.

"Croft state park- used to be an old military training base and a POW camp for american citizens. It also has revolutionary war and civil war graves, beautiful hiking trails, fishing, and horseback riding. Cowpens battlefield- worth going to at least once. Sliding rock NC- worth going to. Looking glass falls in NC beautiful drive and fun to visit. 

There are several distilleries in the area as well Sugar tit, kick back cove, and rock bottom distillery are a few we love. Sugar tit has awesome pineapple moonshine, kick back cove has orange blossom moonshine and agave moonshine they make (basically tequila), and rock bottom has the best muscadine moonshine (anything with muscadines tends to knock me on my ass for some reason- its a love hate relationship). 

Downtown spartanburg is really neat but still growing as a city so most events are still kind of hosted in Greenville. Which greenville has a couple of museums, a trail running from downtown to cleveland park, and amusement centers (frankies fun park, dave and busters, and spare time). There is a free putt putt course downtown spartanburg and you can rent clubs and balls at local establishments. There is a bar and grill downtown spartanburg that has a bowling alley attached as well. There is a jazz club- I haven't been there personally so I don't know much about it. The night life is mostly bars and pubs, and not many night clubs where you don't come out with more holes than you walked in with.

As far as food goes for a lunch I cannot recommend Burgers and Bakery enough. Owned and operated locally- the burgers are some of the best I have eaten and not a bad price point for gourmet burgers. We are a family of 6 and we spend 60$ for 4 adult meals and 2 kids meals with drinks and fries. The Irish pub downtown spartanburg has great food and a lovely atmosphere. I can't think of the name off the top of my head but they take food sensitivities seriously. Peach Country in Campobello has the best peach cider slushies I have ever had- get some SC peaches while you are there.

"That’s going to be a hard market to find a house in right now. We paid within that range for our first house in 2009 and it sold a year ago for $188k, it was only on the market 6 days and we got a few offers. Even new construction has gone up very high, our current floor plan is selling for $30k more than it was a year ago.

As others suggested, see if you can wait a little while. I suspect the market is going to flip from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market.

"That's a really hard market to find a house in. I know from experience! If you're open to moving inside the county, it opens more doors but even then, it's rough.

"Gotcha. We signed one too, and in our case the contract expired after like 2 months. Definitely worth reading over what you signed to see what your options are - I think it’s typical for them to expire. And believe me, I understand how grueling and frustrating the process is! We bought a house in this market (had an offer accepted about 3 weeks ago), but I can’t tell you how many times we felt the same way. Things that helped us were checking for houses listed online (I used realtor.com, partner used homesnap) multiple times a day and sorting by the newest listings. Any that we were remotely interested in, we told our realtor we wanted to go see. All I can say is, it’s worth it to stick with it!

OFTR is a graffiti crew from the northeast and if I’m not mistaken it stands for One for the road. I’ve seen a few different writers put it up so I’m assuming it’s their crew and the only reason I say it stands for one for the road is because I’ve seen a large piece in Knoxville.

Generally it’s going to be easier than your larger universities. I graduated from usc with a bachelors in biology with a chemistry cognate and had to take O Chem 1 and 2 for majors. If you’re taking it there to take it as an easier class then make sure when you transfer it will be accepted by whatever university you go to.

"I wish I could say Spartanburg was a foodie haven, but it really isn't. You're going to have better luck in Greenville or Asheville. That being said, there are definitely some decent places in town.

Nacho Taco in downtown has pretty good street tacos, IMHO.

I like Venus Pie for pizza.

Pig Out is my personal favorite BBQ place, but that's contested around here.

I don't think there are any GREAT italian restaurants in Spartanburg, but I do go to La Taverna occasionally.

Ike's probably has the best burger in town, but as others have said, I can't support that business anymore due to their handling of the COVID situation.

I'm a sucker for cheap chinese food, and I have always got good service from Hunan K.

If you like pho, I like Bangkok Thai near Fresh Market.

The Beacon gives absurdly large portions of mediocre greasy diner food. Worth it for the experience (or to take someone else), but not a place I regular.

Skillet is a decent hole-in-the-wall breakfast joint.

"Mexican: Carona’s on the Westside is good. There’s also one in Roebuck that’s good, [El Pariente](https://elparientemexicanrestaurant.business.site/).

Italian: La Taverna is our go to for local Italian. Their house dressing for salads is my favorite. There’s also [Dellaventura](http://dellaventurasrestaurant.com/) in Greer which is a little bit of a drive but is so good!

Greek: The local Greek church does a festival once a year and they have all kinds of Greek food, souvlaki, chicken, dolmades and all kinds of deserts including Baklava. It’s inexpensive and very good. I think that festival is usually during the summer. The Greek church in Greenville does the same thing as well and it’s during the summer. For a restaurant, Manny’s in Boiling Springs has some Greek food on their menu.

Chinese: China Fun in Springfield off 176 in the Ingles shopping center. New China on E Main Street is good too. 

Thai: Thai Taste on 295. There’s also Bangkok on E Main St.

Pizza: Manny’s in Boiling Springs. Spaced Out Pizza is pretty good too. Town Grill & Pizza in Cowpens is good.

Burgers: The Beacon used to be good, it was okay the last time I went there but I’ve heard it’s doing better again. The new one that opened in Boiling Springs has been talked about a lot and I don’t mean in a positive way, I’ve not heard one good experience there yet, I think it’s Rigsby’s.

"Definitely go New China on Main Street for Chinese. Pretty sketchy building but truly the only good Chinese in the Burg. Uncle Poons used to be good, but has dramatically dropped off in quality in the last few years. 

Burrito Hub for good burritos and fish tacos, by no means “authentic Mexican” but ALWAYS hits the spot. 

Chef Ae’s for burgers, no doubt. Cribb’s kitchen also used to be a good burger, but also just kind of lost it in the last couple years. It was one of the first decent restaurants in the area so it kind of just has a blind following of people who don’t really know good food.

Monster Subs for cold cuts. Just eat there. You won’t regret it. (But they are moving locations on 4/15, so just keep that in mind.)

And a $3 slice from Venus Pie, will do you wonders.",t2_9qfjbquv,Numerous_Holiday5207,0,1617909217.0,0,t1_gtuf1h6,gtuf1h6,False,702PoGoHunter,t3_mlz4tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spartanburg/comments/mlz4tt/need_food_recommendations/,Need food recommendations!,/r/Spartanburg/comments/mlz4tt/need_food_recommendations/gtuf1h6/,3,r/Spartanburg,0,3

"Used to live in Greenville, moved to Spartanburg a couple years ago. Food situation here is less exciting, by a wide margin. That’s not to say there aren’t good places, though.

Burrito Hub and Lemongrass Kitchen (Vietnamese) are my favorites downtown. Want to try Ae’s. Every Thai restaurant I’ve tried has been somewhat inconsistent, but Bangkok Thai (Hillcrest) and Thai Taste (not Taste of Thai) have been the best so far. Hunan K and Jin Jin have good Chinese takeout. Try Venus Pie if you don’t like Pi Squared.

Absolutely no hate toward Taziki’s (it’s a good chain Mediterranean place) but go to Pita House instead. Cash only. Sometimes there’s a long ass wait, sometimes nobody’s there at all. It’s worth it. Get it to go and grab a beer at the Grateful Brew next door.

Also in Greenville check out Henry’s Smokehouse and Mike and Jeff’s BBQ. And the Drop-In Kitchen. And Pizza City near Bob Jones. Oh and Swamp Rabbit Cafe and Grocery.

There aren’t a ton of things I miss about Greenville but the food is definitely one of them.",t2_8fxqs,cupofqueso,0,1617855923.0,0,t1_gtrutww,gtrutww,True,702PoGoHunter,t3_mlz4tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spartanburg/comments/mlz4tt/need_food_recommendations/,Need food recommendations!,/r/Spartanburg/comments/mlz4tt/need_food_recommendations/gtrutww/,2,r/Spartanburg,0,2

"Burrito Hub on Magnolia Street - gotta try the street corn and fish tacos with house pickled cabbage

Chef Aes on Magnolia - love the duck sandwich and the house made kimchi. 

Downtown Deli and Donuts - HUGE menu I still go in and find new delicious things

Venus Pie - buying by the slice for lunch is where it's at. The single slices are bigger than your head. 

Mr Gatties - I know it's a pizza buffet and arcade for kids but HONESTLY delicious pizza for a steal of a deal. Their pizza dough rises over night and once you pay the buffet price (like 10$ I think?) they'll make you anything you want. 

Miguelitos Street Tacos in Chesnee - pretty out of the way but super authentic. I could eat 100 tamales and 200 gorditas. We always order out bc the restaurant is kinda cramped, but worth eating.",t2_38wlxtbv,GillyMoe,0,1617844316.0,0,t1_gtr9kgu,gtr9kgu,True,702PoGoHunter,t3_mlz4tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spartanburg/comments/mlz4tt/need_food_recommendations/,Need food recommendations!,/r/Spartanburg/comments/mlz4tt/need_food_recommendations/gtr9kgu/,2,r/Spartanburg,0,2
"Totally forgot about two of my favorite Mexican places in Boiling Springs that are really hidden gems.
