Teachers / administrators have moved, schools have been shut down, then open, then shut down, all over the state... I have no idea what the right call is right now.

"You've gotten a lot of great info (I'm late to seeing this) but I just wanted to add another young family (we have a \~3 year old and a 7 year old) here who really enjoy living in RWC! Our oldest is in 1st grade and attends Orion Alternative (in the public school district, part of school-of-choice) which is a diverse parent-participation school with an awesome community and she's thriving. We are near Red Morton so are walkable to Magical Bridge (amazing) and tons of camps in the summer are held (thru parks and rec) there as well as lots of awesome events for kids and adults alike (like Pub in the Park). Our neighbors are friendly and fun, lots of young families. You are close (10-30 minutes depending on where you go) to open spaces for hiking and general enjoyment outdoors and the closest beach (Pacifica) is only 30 minutes away (HMB is about the same but weekend traffic can be cumbersome). 

We love downtown, find it perfectly safe to visit and enjoy lots of rotating public events hosted by the city (Mardi Gras, mini-golf, concerts, Zoppe circus, etc), a great library, and restaurants and bars we like as well (and , tbh, we are somewhat snobby about food and drink!). Look, it's not NYC but it's absolutely serviceable and, I would argue, better than Palo Alto and Menlo Park as it's way less ""tech-bruh"" and more diverse (which is important to us). I have colleagues who have specifically sold their homes in Palo Alto and moved to RWC for this reason.

Not sure if you are looking to buy but the housing market is TIGHT (lots of buyers, not a lot of inventory) and prices have skyrocketed (we were lucky to get our place in 2019 and it's value has increased almost 40% since) but if you can get into the market I encourage you to do so as momentum doesn't seem to be slowing and there are more improvements on the way (complete overhaul of Sequoia Station, new community center and pools -- indoor and outdoor -- at Red Morton, just to name a few).

"I live near Palm Park.  (SW of the park, nearer St. Pius church).  I haven't heard any shots myself, nor had police come by.  My grandparents bought the home I'm in now over 50 years ago.  Anecdotally, it's been pretty low crime.  

In the 5 years I've lived here, people have opened our unlocked cars and rifled through our glovebox twice, stolen my catalytic converter (damn them to hell), and walked off my with a toddler's bicycle that was left on the porch.  Who steals a toddler's balance bike?  Ugh.

Beware of spending too much time on Nextdoor.  It's an echochamber for paranoia.

That said, I just logged in to nextdoor and searched for ""gunshot.""  There was one post yesterday, and before that, the last post that popped up was for November.

Anyhow, to finish the anecdote, it sure seems like a safe neighboorhood to me, and I don't recommend getting poisoned by nextdoor-stoked fear

"Sequoia hospital used to have an in-person parent support group (they don’t care if you didn’t give birth there) - I gather it’s virtual now but maybe still a way to meet some people.

Our cohort started an unofficial text group too, and then people met up outside of the actual support group sessions - the text group is still somewhat active a couple of years later; I’ve since left the area but I gather several of them still meet up. If nobody has set up an unofficial text/WhatsApp/FB group in the current cohort then I’d recommend suggesting it, once you’re comfortable (since most people don’t do the support group itself for more than a few months).

"Hey there!

We were in a similar place as you. We lived in San Francisco for over ten years. My wife and I got engaged there, met there, and all three of our kids were born there (we recently had our third, but my wife still gave birth at UCSF since she was used to it). We were feeling the space crunch in SF after we had our second kid, and we lived in the Inner Richmond and felt like the homeless problem was getting worse as well. We also realized that with two kids, the fun nightlife in SF was less appealing. We wanted to move to a place where we had more space for our family, a backyard, a reasonable commute to SF / San Jose, walkability, etc. We moved on Jan 2, 2020... so we're about two years deep into Redwood City. I have a 6 year old, 4 year old, and 7 month old. Apologies in advance that this is a long post - feel free to message me if you want to get in touch and have more specific questions, since it sounds like we were evaluating from similar places...

TL;DR: We love it.

Specifics:

- Redwood City is VERY different depending where you live. As a counter example, San Carlos is a bit more consistent - you can live in the flats or the hill, but San Carlos culture is San Carlos culture. In Redwood City, you have an unincorporated area, you can live up in the hills so it's almost like Woodside, you can live near downtown in a more Urban setting, you can live on the border of San Carlos, and it feels like you're basically in San Carlos, etc. I just mention this because it's hard to generalize the whole city - if you're looking at real estate, really focus in on the neighborhoods you like and check those out.

- Location on the peninsula - I honestly don't think you can do better. My wife and I always joke about this. SFO? 15 minutes with no traffic - 30 on a bad day. 45 if it's awful. SJC? 30 minutes with no traffic. OAK? 45 minutes with no traffic? Want to go to a mall? We're literally equidistant between Stanford Shopping Center and Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo. Need to commute to SF? The baby bullet from Redwood City is great, and you can tell RWC is a focus city for Caltrain. Menlo Park / Palo Alto have a lot to offer, and in Redwood City, you're super close. Similarly, San Carlos / Belmont have great activities / restaurants too - we're right in the middle!

- Walkability - We live a few blocks west of Stacks on El Camino Real, and we LOVE the walkability of the neighborhood. Totally flat - we're ten to fifteen minutes walking distance from the strip of restaurants on Laurel Street in San Carlos or we're fifteen to twenty minutes walking distance from Downtown RWC. Is dining as good as SF here? No. But I consider myself pretty well traveled, and I think SF has the best food in the world... so... it's tough to beat, but the food on the peninsula is good, and I think the overall combo of San Carlos + RWC makes a pretty good dining scene.
- Parks - the parks are great! Stafford Park is awesome. We ride scooters there. Magical Bridge Park is over the top even better.
- Sports and activities - We played T-Ball last year, and it was great. All the families were super nice. Our kids take swim lessons at La Petite Baleen, and we love it - we transferred from the SF location when we moved. We're also members at the Hiller aviation museum, and my kids love going there all the time.
- Outdoors - when the pandemic hit, it forced me to find hiking trails all over, and they are fantastic and quite diverse! Just google some of these: bair island, edgewood park, purisma preserve -- those three hikes are all pretty close to my house, and they are totally different. Also... we're an easy drive to Half Moon Bay - thirty minutes! Just make sure to go early in the morning - traffic to Half Moon Bay gets gross after 10AM when the entire bay area decides to go there for pumpkins. Go early, leave early. 
- Schools - My kids are pretty young, with the oldest in kindergarten. We're Catholic, and we wanted to send him to a Catholic school, but our neighbors send their kids to Clifford Elementary, and they seem super happy with it. I've heard mixed things about RWC schools, but honestly, it feels like COVID has caused a ""great reset"" of schools, and I don't know who ends up on top or bottom when it's all done. Teachers / administrators have moved, schools have been shut down, then open, then shut down, all over the state... I have no idea what the right call is right now.
- Diversity - While I wouldn't say this is a huge priority for me, LACK of diversity drives me crazy, and I felt like I was getting that in SF pre-school. It was crazy competitive, and the only thing parents talked about was which venture investments they were in. At school, my kids interact with kids whose parents are everything - tech workers, doctors, carpenters, county employees, construction, local shop owners, etc.
- Being close to things you need - I can commute to SF, and be there in less than an hour door to door. From the inner richmond, it would take me 35 to 50 minutes to get to downtown anyways - so I haven't lost much there, but also.... I can be at Lucky, Home Depot, Target, Costco, Safeway, or Whole Foods in like ten minutes.

"Story is behind a hard paywall. The following are some excerpts from it that I found noteworthy: 

Trammell Crow acquired the site at 200-240 Twin Dolphin Drive from Sand Hill Property, which received approval from the city last year to construct a garage and office building with the same number of floors and square footage that the property’s new owner has planned. The difference between the two projects is that Sand Hill’s is entirely offices, although it marketed it as suitable for lab companies, while Trammell Crow’s is catered to life science and research tenants.

The firm notified the city this week of its purchase of the Twin Dolphin Drive site and intent to pivot from an administrative office to a life science use there, Redwood City senior planner Apollo Rojas said in an email. It hasn’t provided the city with its plans for the property, now the six-building, almost 50,000-square-foot Westshore Office Park, Rojas said.",t2_4dmy1s5b,mattj8,0,1642726505.0,0,t1_htj9p1p,htj9p1p,True,mattj8,t3_s8xpaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedwoodCity/comments/s8xpaw/trammell_crow_pays_65m_for_site_of_planned_life/,Trammell Crow pays $65M for site of planned life science project in Redwood City,/r/RedwoodCity/comments/s8xpaw/trammell_crow_pays_65m_for_site_of_planned_life/htj9p1p/,4,r/RedwoodCity,0,4

"I’m generally an optimist on these things. A lot of the “testing issues” that some point out have more to do with Redwood City schools having more English as Second Language students than surrounding school districts.  After holding for education and income of the parents, RWC schools are fine to great in most cases. 

Historically, we have lost more senior educators and administrators to surrounding school districts because they pay more.  They were able to pay more because they were on Basic Aid and RWC wasn’t. Logically, as our budget improves from switching to Basic Aid, we should see more retention. 

Consolidation is helping school budgets.  By combining sites and closing unneeded schools, we should have more funds per student. 

For me, I find my kids having interactions with all sorts of children of different backgrounds a plus.  And my values lean to involving my family in schools that help all kids — regardless of economics or hardships — not just my kids. 

If your goal is to send your kid to an Ivy or Stanford or a UC, the Sequoia Union high school district has a good track record.  The IB program at Sequoia has received a lot of praise. 

My youngest had a lot of speech problems from pre-k to 2nd, and the special Ed the school district provided was good - even during COVID. 

Like any school district or community, there are downsides and trade offs, but for most folks, I think you’d find RWC a good choice.

"I've got my youngest kid going to Selby Adelante elementary, which seems like a nice school.  It does Spanish immersion.  It's the product of one of those consolidations mentioned by another respondent.  COVID has screwed up every school, and made the type of interaction possible for parents before not possible now.  My daughter went to Buena Vista (spanish immersion) in San Francisco, and the program seems very comparable.

At any rate, he's learning, he's having fun, and they have a nice afterschool program, too.

Dittos on the sports leagues - there are at least two soccer leagues, plus baseball, softball, football, etc.

Also RWC is almost exactly equidistant between SF and San Jose, which is a bonus.

That all said, we're also transplants from San Francisco, and most everyone still maintains ties to S.F.  If we could afford to stay in S.F., we would have.

The farmer's market is very limited compared to (into l IMHO) much better ones in Palo Alto, mountain View, and San Mateo (San Carlos is kind of meh and the one in Menlo isn't even worth mentioning). 

Crime is up if you live anywhere East or near downtown.

The other things you mentioned I mostly agree with. Downtown needs more nice retail though. Compare to Burlingame and it is fairly stark. Our downtown needs investment but it can't attract the same money as other richer cities nearby.

"My family has lived in Redwood City for nearly 30 years.  Here’s some things we like.

* Folks say the public schools are bad. I’d disagree. North Star was just rated one of the top elementary schools in the state (https://www.usnews.com/education/k12/articles/top-ranked-elementary-and-middle-schools-in-california). Clifford has great pre-K teachers and a fun and economical after school program.  

* Redwood City School Districts has moved to a Basic Aid funding which should mean schools have a lot more funding that in the past, and be more competitive for good teachers.  (https://www.rcsdk8.net/Page/8755)

* The library and parks are top notch. We live near Stafford Park, which has concerts throughout the summer!  Stulstaft Park has some fun wild places.  Edgewood has great trails. We have a Magic Bridge park off of Valota that’s neat. 

* Lots of cool places for kids.  There’s a strong AYSO and Little League. Kings Swim and La Petite Baleen are great to get your little ones swimming. The Parks and Rec has some fun summer programs at the sports house.  There’s an indoor play space called La Petite Playhose that wore my kids out pre-CoVID. 

* Downtown is great for kids.  The Cinemark is a fun place to watch movies. My kids have exposure to lots of good and reasonable restaurants.  There’s a lot of events most years (the Fourth of July parade and fun run, Hometown Holidays, Summer Downtown concerts and Zoppe Circus). 

Plus the bars and restaurants are great for us adults too. A Michelin rated sushi restaurant just opened up on Broadway.  Fox Theatre can occasionally have something interesting. 

* Unlike Palo Alto or Menlo Park, RWC feels more like a real city than a bedroom community. More varied housing, more industry, etc.  If that’s something you like, you’ll like it here. 

* Safeway and Whole foods are close by.  Home Depot is just down the road in San Carlos.  

* Every Saturday  (except in winter) there’s a Farmers Market downtown. 

All in all, I think it’s the best, most down to earth place on the peninsula.

"I'm not sure if this story is behind a hard paywall; if it is, the following are some snippets that may be of interest to the sub:

IQHQ, a life science-focused REIT, bought a second site in Redwood City, paying Oracle Corp. $164 million for a vacant office building and an adjacent parking lot in a further sign of booming demand for Bay Area laboratory space.

It paid about $250 a square foot for the 263,000-square-foot building at 10 Twin Dolphin Drive and a parking lot next door, according to two people with knowledge of the transaction, speaking anonymously because they weren’t authorized to talk publicly about it. The deal closed on Wednesday, they said.

If IQHQ ends up pursuing a life science redevelopment of the entire site, it could potentially build up to about 655,000 square feet of lab space, according to the site’s offering memorandum. Yet that maximum comes with a caveat: It would need to create public access to the nearby shoreline and San Francisco Bay, whether through new pedestrian and bike paths along the water’s edge or new docks to connect a project to existing marinas, among a handful of other requirements.",t2_4dmy1s5b,mattj8,0,1636742397.0,0,t1_hkd3r8s,hkd3r8s,True,mattj8,t3_qshq54,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedwoodCity/comments/qshq54/iqhq_pays_164m_to_buy_15acre_redwood_city_site/,IQHQ pays $164M to buy 15-acre Redwood City site from Oracle,/r/RedwoodCity/comments/qshq54/iqhq_pays_164m_to_buy_15acre_redwood_city_site/hkd3r8s/,7,r/RedwoodCity,0,7

"I don't think prices will plummet for a long time - not until there is some disaster that effectively depopulates the area.  Redwood City has about 75000 people, and enough housing for maybe 60000.  So people double-up and bid up every available space.

If Redwood City built housing for 15000 more people, so we had enough for the 75000 here, it wouldn't help that much, because 20000 people from other parts of the Bay Area would move in.

So, it's an inescapably regional issue, that will take an enormous amount of time and political will.

Sorry, I'm trying to be helpful but I don't have a lot of direct experience with this - I think there are ""ESL"" courses you can sign up for to get a student VISA?

A lot of foreign-born software engineers will do a Master's of Computer Science and then find employment as a software engineer in the USA. Though this costs a lot more money.

"Hey! I'm a junior in high school that's attended both of the public high school districts in Redwood City.

The Redwood City School District is great! There are a lot of support systems in place, and there's a huge emphasis on community. I attended Orion Elementary School, which exists as a part of John Gill Elementary now. Taft has made a lot of improvements with their support and their staff in recent years. Someone posted that you can attend another school other than your neighborhood school, which is true, and I would suggest looking into this option. North Star Academy is also a great option for 3-8 grades. So is Roy Cloud, which is a bit far from the Friendly Acres area.

Taft only goes to K-5, so unless you transfer to North Star Academy, you'll have to choose a middle school after attending Taft. The middle schools are where it gets shakier. I went to Kennedy Middle School, which is the largest middle school. It's not the best choice. Avoid it if you can. Bullying is a huge problem and the principal is very oblivious to inequality. Instead, Roosevelt or even MIT is a better option.

RCSD only encompasses K-8. Grades 9-12 are under the Sequoia Union High School District. If you're moving to Friendly Acres and choose to stay there for that long, the neighborhood school assigned to you will either be Sequoia or Menlo-Atherton, both of which are great schools. My friends like both schools. I currently attend Cañada Middle College, but I went to Woodside and I'm still registered there.

Both RCSD and SUHSD have one major downside: the administration in the district can be an absolute shitshow, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It's hard to have a voice unless you're a parent, and even then it's very difficult. But, I'm part of a team for both districts that's addressing this issue and setting a long-term plan to fix this.

Let me know if you have any questions, I would love to help!

"In the RWC downtown area:

Rock n Wrap has some traditional middle eastern vegan fare in addition to an incredibly tasty zalouk if you like garlic/roasted eggplants.

In a similar vein, Zadna's also offers good middle eastern vegan options with especially good mujadara & homemade pita bread. Their hummus is also decent.

Crouching Tiger has a whole sub-section of menu for vegan fake meat dishes (Chinese buddhist) in addition to their decent variety of vegetable only dishes (string beans/various tofu dishes/shredded potato/sautéed leafy green vegetables etc)

Venga Empanada has a couple of vegan empanadas with extremely authentic chimichurri sauce. Their gazpacho soup & white bean soup are also delicious.

Marufuku Ramen has a stellar vegetarian ramen and if you ask them to not include the egg, everything else (spinach noodle, sesame paste/vegetable based broth, seaweed etc) is vegan ([https://eastbayexpress.com/marufuku-new-oakland-ramen-royalty-2-1/](https://eastbayexpress.com/marufuku-new-oakland-ramen-royalty-2-1/))

Zareen's has a few good Indian vegan staple dishes like dal, palak aloo etc.

May's also has an entire section of Vietnamese vegan options including vegetarian spring rolls, banh mi, hu tieu, claypot, and other rice plates,

=====

In Belmont/San Carlos:

V & V Delicious Crepes have lots of savory vegan options that are outstanding and filling.

Mediterranean Delight offers other middle eastern staples but the falafels are their specialty.

Red Hot Chili Pepper specializes in indian-chinese fusion.

"I might be a bit biased since I was born and raised in RWC, but I think there is a lot of fun things to do here.

In comparison, Sunnyvale (and much of the South Bay region), is a sprawling, car-centric, area full of drab cookie cutter houses and strip malls. Generally speaking, RWC definitely has more character.

Downtown Redwood City is very lively and has tons of events (free outdoor concerts, free outdoor movies, farmers markets, festivals, etc.) during non-covid times. There a bunch of trendy bars and restaurants, a 20 screen movie theater, and lots of cute coffee shops.

The Port of Redwood City is a hidden gem. It has a fresh fish market (you buy the fish directly off of the fishermans boat), a public fishing pier, and a kayak/SUP board rental shop. You can take the kayaks/SUP and kayak around the marshlands.

There are some cool hiking spots in/near RWC like Edgewood Park, Pulgas Ridge, Bair Island, and more.

RWC is situated almost exactly halfway between San Francisco and San Jose, and has a convenient commuter train (CalTrain) that will take you there.

Its also only about 25 minutes to the beach, and even less time to get to the dense, old growth redwood forests along Hwy 84 & 35.

"Sunnyvale is very boring. Mountain View is much better but I'd recommend RWC over both. 

North Fair Oaks is a great community but can vary greatly as far as crime. The closer to Marsh Road the better.

 In the past, being west of El Camino (or even better, west of Alameda de las Pulgas) was considered more desirable. If you want to be closer to 101 because of FB or Google then N. Fair Oaks is ideal. 

The nicest parts of RWC is Mount Carmel (close to downtown) and Emerald Hills (close to 280).

"Welcome! We live close to El Camino Real right on the Redwood City / San Carlos border. How far do you typically like to run?

- There's a Bair Island running loop that is 3 miles. It's about a ten minute jog from my house to get there, and it's a beautiful trail.
- While not a trail, my typical running route is south through the Mt Carmel neighborhood, and then west on Jefferson, North on Alameda De Las Pulgas, into San Carlos, and back down to my house. It's mostly flat, but with a good hill when I go up Alameda, and it's a 7 mile loop to my house. This is my most common run, and I enjoy it.
- If I take the run I mentioned above, but if I have more time, then I run south all the way to Woodside Rd, and then I head west to Alameda. Running on Woodside Rd isn't the most pleasant, as it's pretty busy, but it's not too bad, and this makes the total run 10.5 miles.
- Edgewood Park - this is a 2.5 mile run from my house, so I'm out 5 miles before I get to the trails, but Edgewood Park is a super cool nature area for running. Note that there's a massive hill at first, but after that, it's very cool. Note that you may see real wildlife here. I've seen deer, wild turkeys, and other cool things. I haven't *yet* seen a rattlesnake, but I know they're up there somewhere.

I've lived in Redwood City for about 18 months now, following over 10 years in San Francisco. I find San Francisco to be the best running city in the world. The weather, the terrain, the variety, Golden Gate Park, etc. I was there last weekend and got very nostalgic. That being said, Redwood City has been a great place to run, and I no longer have a fear of being mowed down by crazy early morning Uber / Lyft drivers in the city haha. I still have a lot more to explore here.

Oh and in terms of my neighborhood for commute, it's a ten to fifteen minute walk to downtown / Caltrain. Maybe 20 if I go slow.

FYI Edgewood park has a hill that is famous due to Jerry Rice running it for conditioning during his days with the 49ers. He was so well conditioned and credited this hill with much of the hard work.

"Redwood City is definitely runnable. There are no real trails here of any considerable length that you can run, but the streets of RWC are pedestrian friendly. Just avoid El Camino, Woodside Rd, Veterans, and the other primary roads and you'll have a good run. I've run in the day and after dark (with lights) and never had trouble. If you're really hankering for trails I recommend heading out to Woodside or Portola Valley, a quick 10-15 minute drive towards Skyline. I began running in high school in Portola Valley and the trail network there is remarkable. As long as you don't mind hills, you'll be very happy running Portola Valley. The parks up towards Skyline provide an endless amount of open space to explore.

Since moving to RWC, I've left my hiking for the hills and do all my running down here between Redwood Ave and Whipple. I've made a bunch of loops from my house of varying length between 5-7 miles and 50-200 feet elevation that keep me challenged and never get old.

"You’re sort of answering your own question. Price is based on demand. If you have doubts, then it’s likely some portion of potential future buyers also will have doubts. No house is perfect though, some percentage of people will always find something. In hot markets like the Bay Area for last 10 years, except for a year here and there, you’re likely to be okay, just might not get top dollar. But in slow times, stuff like that will make it harder to sell, and likely lower the price due to less demand.

Follow up: after buying/owning/selling multiple condos and homes, I cannot stress how important location is to ease of selling home. You can’t fix that.

"So.... my mother’s house has the HH pipeline running *thru* the backyard. The only inconveniences are:

(1) about 15 years ago, they cordoned off her yard and ripped it all up to replace the mains with enormous 6 foot (I think) diameter pipes. These replaced the originals, so I don’t think this extensive disturbance would happen more than once every 50 years. 

(2) you can’t put any permanent structures or plant trees in the easement area. When the above construction project took place, the crews discovered all sorts of things that residents illicitly erected: pergolas, sheds with foundations, fountains, in-law units. They all got torn out, as they violated the lease contract homeowners have with the SF water district. 

I can imagine living *adjacent* to the pipes would be less restrictive than the above. You may want to look into trees allowed to be planted. Things with extensive root systems like willow trees may be banned. 

I haven’t seen houses *adjacent* to the pipes spend a longer period of time on the market - they seem to sell at the same rate.

"I know someone whose house burned down in the fires last year, had insurance, but his life is still pretty much ruined for a couple years. The forest in California is a dangerous place to live, and it’s only going to get worse. There are measures you can take to reduce the risk, like cover your house in fireproof shingles and roofing, and remove plants within a perimeter from your home. Depending on the lot this may be impractical or you may not even own the land in the perimeter.

It might still be worth it to you... it’s a beautiful place to live most of the time. Just consider it’s fairly likely you will need to evacuate some time if you live there for several years, and if you have bad luck your home may be destroyed.

"I’ve lived in the Huxley for 6 months and have been unimpressed with it. 

Cons: There’s been a long slew of brake-in’s (cars and bike room) which took management many months to do anything about. There’s now finally an after hours security guard. 

There’s also a lot of inconsiderate residents playing loud music at night and tossing trash into the hallways. 

It’s a very noisy building. Construction on one side that starts every morning at 7am and a very loud busy street on the other. If you are a light sleeper, you won’t fair well here.

Pros: The units are very nice. Love how spacious they’ve made the kitchens. The maintenance team is also super efficient and friendly. 

A nice little perk is the package locker system they have in the basement. You get directly notified as soon as your package is placed inside so you don’t have to worry about someone grabbing your stuff.

"Apparently the apartments next to the In-n-Out on Veteran's Boulevard end up reeking of fast food.

1 month of free rent is a standard incentive offer. The base rent should go up as the pandemic's risk decreases, but I would expect apartment companies to continue offering 1 month of free rent.

FYI - rental complexes like to offer x-months-free-rent rather than simply lowering their base rent, because there is state-wide rent control in CA which limits the year-over-year-increase-in-rent to something like 5% + inflation% (so effectively $7% or so).

"I've been a happy resident of Indigo for the last few months. I'll likely extend my lease depending on rent. I also toured most of the buildings you looked at - I almost chose Marston (close 2nd) and liked Huxley but it was out of my budget. 

Rent has been mostly stable over the last few months but the offers (months free) have been decreasing. For example, Indigo used to offer 6 months for 50%, but now I think they offer 1 month off.  All bets are off for the summer though, truly no one can predict what will happen when things open back up.

Be sure to check out the City of Redwood City website for dates and times of their wonderful outdoors events this summer. You'll find free concerts in the downtown square as well as free movie nights on the same square. (Hint: bring a folding beach chair and a pitcher of Margarita's: these events are always well-attended \[oops! pre-covid-19.\]) 

Pack shorts & tee-shirts for April - October/ layer clothing the rest of the year. Be sure to visit Half Moon Bay: we always say, ""It's just a Margarita away!"" Half Moon Bay is on the Pacific Ocean; and the only way in get's jammed on weekends & throughout October (Pumpkins everywhere) so leave early & take your dog to the beach on a leash if other dogs are nearby.

Covid-19 really did a number on everything (everywhere) so a little advance research is in order. 

You will absolutely LOVE this city; but use your cars alarm because there seems to be a rash of cars whose catalytic converters have been stolen in just a few minutes: better safe than sorry.

Dog Friendly Hiking Trails

Pulgas Ridge Open Space - part of it allows off-leash hiking

Stulsaft Park - smaller city park that allows off-leash running

Eaton Park- city park that requires leash for dogs

Arastradero Preserve- Bigger park for hiking but also requires leash

Windy Hill - Leash required hike that gets some great panoramic views of the bay",t2_vo3mk,thepenumbra,0,1615580139.0,0,t1_gqq7k1s,gqq7k1s,True,thisisrohit,t3_m3o658,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedwoodCity/comments/m3o658/moving_to_redwood_city_foodtrail_recommendations/,Moving to Redwood City!

"Practically everything in Redwood City is takeout-friendly right now. Most restaurants are on Doordash/Grubhub for pickup or delivery, and if you're into picking stuff up yourself, you can save money and benefit the restaurant more by ordering directly.

Jefferson is a main artery through Redwood City that goes straight through downtown but all the way out of town to I-280 as well, so it depends which part of Jefferson you'll be on, but you should have easy access to a great deal of what the city has to offer. The other major arteries are El Camino Real/CA-82 (roughly north/south) and Woodside Rd/CA-84 (roughly east-west).

For dog walking, if it's convenient to where you'll be living, check out Stulsaft Park. It has a large dog-friendly area. If you're on the far west side of town you could also visit Barkley Fields. Hiking is abundant in the area but I'll leave that advice to people who get out more. ;)",t2_hiy4m,inclining,0,1615576085.0,0,t1_gqpyu1r,gqpyu1r,True,thisisrohit,t3_m3o658,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedwoodCity/comments/m3o658/moving_to_redwood_city_foodtrail_recommendations/,Moving to Redwood City!

"It's great if you're willing to pay for it, and if you want somewhere a little quieter than downtown RWC. It's pretty much identical to several other ""luxury"" places I've lived, unexciting, very good overall, and a few minor things to be improved.

Apartments are nice, little bit of noise bleed from neighbors stomping around above, but overall very quiet, effectively no road noise.  Occasionally a train blast or the ship's horn can be heard at the port across the creek. The building is new, maintenance is prompt. Management is responsive.  Location next to Bair Island is good. Downtown RWC is about a ten minute drive, walking downtown is doable in about 40 minutes but the pedestrian routes are kind of lousy.

I moved 6 months ago during Covid so I can't really speak to the quality of the amenities. Honestly at this point it's pathetic we can't use the grills or kayaks (there's a kayak rental in RWC that is allowed to operate). 

Not especially guest friendly - guests are allowed max 4 days/mo, somewhat limited guest parking that has occasionally filled up during Covid. The package rooms are a mess much of the time, Fedex/Ups/Amazon just dump tons of boxes in one of several spots, so good luck. Plenty of pets around but barking dogs probably won't be tolerated.  Sometimes the trash rooms get messy because other residents can't be bothered to properly dispose their waste. I would not rent an apartment directly across the hall from the trash areas, they can smell bad frequently.

The utilities for my 1 bd run ~$130-200/mo, + a little more for AC.

"Mega late to this but honestly it can be a dangerous place or very safe place depending on what you’re involved with and where you live. Crime has gone down now but there still is shootings from time to time and gangs are still around. It use to be way worst , Places like Stambaugh-Heller use to be very dangerous. Knew alot of young men who lost there life in that neighborhood especially during the 90s to mid 2000’s , in my opinions this would be considered the most dangerous since its in between Downtown and North Fair Oaks its sees alot of action. You can search up old news articles about the crazy stuff that this neighborhood has seen. I also believe it was very dangerous since Surenos/Nortenos and Tongan Crips reside in this neighborhood and fight for turf. I would wake up to gunshots on Heller Street and witness stabbings outside of Hoover Elementary. The area around Fair Oaks Elementary can also be bad. Some of the apartments look like projects out of a movie. Rolison Road has gotten way better but also use to be very dangerous. Little Mexico (North Fair Oaks) has calmed down alot too but expect to see many Norteno gang members every now and then. Mezes Park (aka tank park) can be a little sketchy at night but it is near the jail. The 400 block of Vera Avenue has a gang as well but many apartments have been remodeled and not much activity there now. Whipple Avenue west of El Camino does not have any gang activity but there is alot of homeless and crazy drivers (particularly street racers) seen cars get chased by police all the time on Whipple and have seen cars get crashed into and suspects will leave the scene. Palm Park , Redwood Avenue and Poplar can also be sketchy and dangerous at night but as long as you keep to yourself then you’re fine theres really no gang bangers there and if they are there mostly from Geneva Avenue or Vera. Overall the city has really changed but all the areas I mentioned definitely has had its fair share of shootings , stabbings , homicides , robberies , home invasion and etc. Woodside Plaza , Mt. Carmel , Selby Lane , Arlington Rd , Edgewood , Farm Hill , Seqouia , Palomar Park these are all very safe neighborhoods who have never really seen any crime. Downtown is really beautiful and pretty safe.

"not to ask you where you're living exactly, but as someone who lives there, what do you mean by west of el camino and east of mt. Carmel? I kinda thought mt carmel started as soon as you got west of el camino on the other side of Sequoia.

In any case, I live pretty close to there, and I run through it all the time. We're a little more north near the San Carlos border. I find it really charming, and I personally haven't seen too much crime. 

If you're close to El Camino, as I am, you will get the occasional homeless wanderer doing something interesting. We've lived here for a year, and that has happened twice.

"I toured 7 buildings in downtown Redwood City a few months ago, and my absolute favorite was Indigo. It's beautiful and comparably priced with all others. The amenities are better than other downtown buildings (in comparison to Marshton that was mentioned) but it's main con is that it's \~2 blocks further from everything. Almost all of the new buildings in RWC will have concrete between the different apartments, so there's strong sound proofing. I've never heard my neighbors. I also really liked Radius when I visited and think it's also a great contender to consider also. Many of these places are offering steep discounts right now (I got 6 months for half off from Indigo), so I'd look around if you have the option!

Edit: Just wanted to clarify that everything in downtown RWC is within a 10-15 minute walk, so it's not a big deal imo to be another 2 blocks away.

"My husband and I moved to RWC a decade ago at your age before we had kids (after grad school in the area) and found, out of the nearest Bay Area suburbs, it was the most diverse (and that diversity more celebrated in the community than, say, Palo Alto, San Carlos, Menlo Park, etc). We have similar hobbies to you and regularly hike up in the redwoods off Skyline, surf over in HMB area/Montara or Pacifica or Ocean Beach (or, if want a day trip, Santa Cruz). We’ve always had dogs and before kids would easily head up to SF for some “real city” time. We also bike all over with no issues, so if being by your partner’s job in RWC is a priority I think you’ll be fine.

"If you are interested in living in and exploring the Bay Area, Redwood City is nicely located to do it. You are relatively close to San Francisco (“The City”) and San Jose, and can quickly hop over to Half Moon Bay and the beaches. There are ample city and state parks and recreation areas to keep you busily hiking or exploring. Many will need a car though. There are more and more dedicated bike trails and lanes. And biking is pretty easy on the bay-side of 101.  Check out [511.org](https://511.org) for transit and biking options, including maps of trails and protected lanes. 

CalTrain makes it easy to get many places, but its operating hours and infrequency should be noted before making any major plans. Like, it’s not getting your intoxicated self back from The City late at night. 

Redwood City is also more affordable than many other places in the Bay Area. The downtown area has grown and has a lot to offer (well, setting aside the pandemic). That had some great concerts and other events in Courthouse square and their parks. An Oktoberfest, etc. 

You might find more nightlife in Palo Alto or Mountain View, but you can get to those places fairly easily if you want to.",t2_ckj0z,senormano,0,1607405544.0,0,t1_gf0zkwi,gf0zkwi,True,jungleluna26,t3_k8ukc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedwoodCity/comments/k8ukc0/what_would_you_do/,What would you do?,/r/RedwoodCity/comments/k8ukc0/what_would_you_do/gf0zkwi/,2,r/RedwoodCity,0,2
"If weather is high on your list of priorities, then I think you’ll really enjoy the Bay Area. Weather is probably some of the best in the entire country, aside from somewhere like Orange County in So Cal. Winters are relatively mild, summers are not too hot (a lot of housing doesn’t even have AC). 

The activities you mentioned are also perfect for the Bay Area. So much nature around, great hiking. If you opt for RWC, you’re about a 45 minute drive to the coast for stunning views along highway 1 and half moon bay. You can also get over to Santa Cruz and Monterey fairly easily. Just note that the ocean is cold!!! If you like surfing, get ready for some chilly water.

Unfortunately, I wouldn’t say there’s too much culture in RWC. We have a small downtown area with restaurants, a theater, and a center square, but it’s a bit bland comparatively. SF might provide more of the culture you’re looking for, and it is about a 45 minute drive away. East bay might be a bit more interesting, Berkeley area is kinda cool and has a completely different feel. Might be worth checking out.

Also, worth noting that RWC schools aren’t that great, if that’s something you need the think about. Would recommend San Carlos instead if you really like the peninsula and need to worry about schools.

Finally, RWC isn’t that great of a biking city. I see bicyclists, but always feel it’s pretty dangerous and wouldn’t personally bike on most of the streets, but everyone has different levels of comfort.

"Well... over the last decade or so it went from sleepy and nothing into a fairly interesting town with a decent downtown.  There is lots of new housing nearby CalTrain.  You will still need a car most likely.  The nightlife shuts down pretty early, especially if you're used to eastern nightlife.  CA shuts down way earlier as a rule.  

It's a half hour to the beach (half moon bay) and about 40 mins to San Francisco (the real city), and about the same to San Jose.  Those number assume no traffic.  

There are some good hiking spots nearby within hike/bike range but those will probably get boring after a while.  Pulgas Ridge is a great place for your dog as it has a huge off-leash area.  

During COVID a lot of what makes the Bay Area cool is less so.. outdoor restaurants all year, great climate, etc is harder to enjoy as much.

You do have proximity to all of those things you're looking for (there are great nearby spots for hiking in particular, and some of the best in the country just a few hours drive away in basically every direction), but in the immediate vicinity it's pretty quiet. That's definitely appealing for some, but if you're looking to be immersed in the culture of a new place, you might be disappointed. Day to day, it feels like pretty typical suburbs here.

"Dear Brute Sentiment,

Thanks for the information.  I lived in a  condo on Port Walk Place back in 1988 and knew about Marine World.  We used to see a lot of red chickens  that reportedly were escapees from Marine World and get woken up in the mornings by the red roosters cock a doodledooing.  

But I didn't know that the animals from Marine World were used inmovies - very cool.  I've been to Marine World after it moved to Vallejo - very nice.

When I lived just off Marine World Parkway sometimes we would see lost people at the convienience store (in the strip mall that now contains Mistral ) asking how to get to Marine World!

"Many decades ago, on the land where Oracle Headquarters now sits, there used to be a non-profit wildlife park called “Marine World Africa U.S.A.”  This park had all sorts of wildlife, from orcas and dolphins to lions and tigers, and much more.

Being a unique sort of park, Marine World was engaged for many uses by the filmmaking community in the Bay Area.  And of course, George Lucas was one such filmmaker.

When Lucas’ new desert world needed an animal that carried sand people, he went to Marine World.  And the Banthas in the original film (Episode 4) were played by an elephant who lived at Marine Works named [Mardji](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mardji).  She stayed at the park for decades, continuing to give rides.

Another notable film appearance from Marine World was Nepo who started in the horror film “Orca” that came out in 1977, the same year as Star Wars.

Marine World moved to Vallejo in 1986, and was later bought out by Six Flags.  Six Flags Discovery Kingdom is what remains.

Redwood Shores was built out for commercial and residential use over the 1980’s, but if you ever wondered about the naming of two key streets...Marine Parkway was previously known as Marine World Parkway, and the cross-street into the parking lot was Twin Dolphin Drive, named for some of the park’s famous animals.

"Hi there, and welcome to the mid-peninsula!

You are going to do okay living in any of the cities mentioned in these comments (San Carlos, RWC, Belmont, Foster City), but to be bluntly honest, your budget is really going to determine where you are going to live, as this area is very expensive.

If you want to bike to work, your ideal city is Foster City.  Every other city will require you to cross a freeway to get to Redwood Shores.  There’s actually not a single road that gets you from Redwood Shores to Foster City, but the Bay Trail will, so you’ll avoid a lot of the risks with riding alongside cars.  Also, Redwood Shores and Foster City are flat, but living in San Carlos or Belmont could mean you end up in the hills, making the ride a bit rougher (at least on the way home).

Outside of that, you’ll really need a car, unless you want Uber or Lyft to be a huge part of your budget.  Mass transit on the mid-peninsula is very limited, and is not designed around social trips to and from the local downtowns, or even shopping in general unless it’s a mall.

I live in Foster City (just north of RWS) and commute to Palo Alto.  During commute hours (non-pandemic), I need to budget a little over an hour to get to and fro for a trip that otherwise would be a half hour.  So while Palo Alto certainly would have a little more appeal, living close to Stanford and a lot more people your age...the commute is bad.  (And to be honest, over the last year, downtown Palo Alto is dying with big stores closing and the social life feeling more toxic than just a few years ago.)

Good luck with the new job and going back to the office!

PS - If you’re a Star Wars nerd, make sure to ask a local about what used to be in Redwood Shores (before it became Redwood Shores) and its ties to Star Wars. ;)",t2_bo6u0,BruteSentiment,0,1605808607.0,0,t1_gcun2m5,gcun2m5,True,truliestephanie,t3_jwvd9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedwoodCity/comments/jwvd9c/25f_new_job_in_redwood_shores_where_should_i_live/,25F.

"We're in Redwood City and searched/toured around a bunch over the past few weeks. We ultimately decided to move to San Jose to save more money and get more space, but here's what I observed for RWC:

* Prices have increased slightly over the past 2 weeks--up by like $50/$100 a month. Not sure if the trend will continue in this direction but worth noting
* Set up alerts on Zillow for your price range/requirements and check the email alerts everyday; same for Craiglist (not sure if they have email alerts, but I literally just kept a tab open and refreshed everyday)
* If you're looking at the bigger buildings (Encore/Indigo/Radius/Marston/Franklin/etc), bookmark their websites and check their availability daily. Also--reach out to the community manager directly. Phone is best for this, we've found the online leads system is iffy at best and it's hard to get in touch with the right person. Once they know what you're looking for, they often reach out to you with new availability before it goes live on the website.
* Most buildings are offering at least 1 month free, but we've seen up to 2 months offered on select units.

"If you have a regular sized freezer, strategically buy items at Costco. We buy fresh fish, beef, and chicken and divvy it up and freeze serving sizes to cook later. Can't really neat the quality and price. The membership is $60 a yr. and you'll get that back in gas alone. They also have some creative items like chicken kale parmesan patties that also freeze well and are individually packed. We also love their selection and prices of cheeses. I go in with my friends on loaves of bread but frankly the price of two loaves of bread is usually equivalent to one at any other grocery store. I'm happy to donate loaves of bread occasionally, or again, freezer. Sigona's is just across the street for fresh fruit in smaller quantities.
