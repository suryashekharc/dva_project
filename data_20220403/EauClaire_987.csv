Hello Neighbor: 

My name is Patricia and I am a volunteer here in Eau Claire. I am writing you this letter to invite you and your family to a special event that millions will attend around the world, it is the anniversary of Jesus death. 

When Jesus came to the earth it was for a purpose (Matthew 20:28), he gave his life for those he loved. On the night before he died, and after Jesus and his disciples had the Lorde's supper, that Jesus said to them ""do this in remembrance of me."" 

And so on the night of Friday April 15th at 730pm we will be gathered together at the Lismore Hotel in Eau Claire to remember Jesus death and what it means for us. 

I hope you will be able to join us - everyone is invited and on collection are taken. 

Sincerely, Patricia Swanson 

PS We also invite you to a special talk at the Kingdom Hall of Jehova's Witnesses at 3400 Horlacher Lane Eau Claire - the date is Sunday April 10th - 1:00 pm the theme is ""Where can you find hope?""",t2_1p8etf3m,Crystal_Pesci,0,1648940943.0,0,t1_i35vmxd,i35vmxd,True,Crystal_Pesci,t3_tuvstx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eau_Claire/comments/tuvstx/anyone_else_get_a_creepy_ass_letter_in_the_mail/,Anyone else get a creepy ass letter in the mail from the Jehova's Witnesses?,/r/Eau_Claire/comments/tuvstx/anyone_else_get_a_creepy_ass_letter_in_the_mail/i35vmxd/,1,r/Eau_Claire,0,1

"ECASD administration regularly sends an employment report to the school board for approval. The latest [1] report recommended 15 hires. If you'd like to see past reports, you can find them on the ECASD school board website [2]. Hopefully that can give you some perspective on employment in the district.

Coming from out of state, you should be aware of a few things about Wisconsin and education spending.

Since 2016, 7 in 10 districts have gone to referendum. Special education reimbursement to public schools has fallen from ~70% in the 70s to ~25% now (private schools get 90% reimbursement). Act 10 took away collective bargaining for state unions. To put it diplomatically, education has not been a state spending priority.

Eau Claire has an additional handicap. State revenue limits implemented in '93/'94 have hurt ECASD significantly. I won't bore you with the details, but ECASD is the 8th largest district in Wisconsin but 258th of 421 in revenue limit.

I have several family members that work for ECASD. I attended ECASD. My children attend ECASD. I have had a great experience working with the ECASD staff. I hope I haven't scared you away, but I also want you to have a more complete picture of the state of affairs in our fair state.

"Edit: disclaimer: one of my family members works for the district in special education.

I believe they are gathering feedback about what stakeholders want to see in the referendum. That said, there are some outstanding issues around the district.

Prior to COVID, there were a number of south side elementary schools nearing capacity. I'm sure that's becoming a pressing issue again, so they're almost certain to be included.

North is overcrowded, which will likely create some backlash due to the recent redistricting, but it'll be considered.

Roosevelt will likely get the shaft again, but that's nothing new. Their solution to solving their overcrowding, last time, was to propose closing it. Let that sink in a minute.

Operational costs might get added. We've been fucked by the state since the 90s due to revenue limits (we are a top ten, by size, school district but are ~300 of 500 in funding). That, and the state funding a paltry 25% of special education reimbursements (down from ~70% in the 70s), mean we struggle to fund just about anything.

Overall, Eau Claire is very safe.  Lot of white people especially compared to bigger American cities, but they're just big enough that I wouldn't worry about being Indian there.  There are actually quite a few southeast-Asians in the area as well.

Having met quite a few Indians in my life, are you veg?  Do you drink?  Wisconsin especially has a lot of beef/pork, but you can usually find chicken or veg options.  Keep in mind though, US considers eggs to be vegetarian so if that's a problem for you it may be something to keep in mind.  Vegan food will have no eggs, dairy, or any animal byproduct.

"Hi! 

I'm a lifelong [Eau Claire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eau_Claire%2C_Wisconsin) resident. I live in the neighborhood near the university and it is one of the [top 10 safest neighborhoods in the city.](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/wi/eau-claire/crime) 

On different occasions, I've left my keys in my car door, my keys on my front porch steps, left my cars unlocked, left a car door open overnight, left my garage open, and left my house unlocked. I've never had a thing disturbed or stolen.

My sister lives about 5 miles away and her car was stolen in the night from her driveway, but I think that's the worst thing crime-wise that has happened to anyone I personally know. 

According to US News and World Reports, [Wisconsin is the 12th safest state](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/crime-and-corrections/public-safety) in the US and is  and [ranked 8th overall.](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/wisconsin)

"There’s plenty of bars here, and I don’t claim to have been to all of them so there may be some you come to love that I don’t write about here. I’m mid 20s F and have been here throughout college.  

College bars are going to be the pickle, the brat, the pio, shenanigans (called ‘shenans’), brothers. These are all on water street. If you’re looking for the loud college vibe, there you go! If not, also on water street you’ve got the Joynt and the Grand Illusion (the GI). These bars are good for relaxing, sitting and chatting and it’s a crowd that’s a little older than the college bars. 

Water street bars that serve food are gonna be El Pat (Mexican, drunk food, open late - attracts the college crowd). Mogie’s pub and dooleys pub both serve great classic pub food. 

Now downtown you’ve got the Plus which has live comedy nights and great pizza, several bars for the older locals like Clancy’s and the Mousetrap, the Firehouse is trendier and has great beer. 

The college bars as I mentioned earlier and Scooters - which is an LGBTQ+ bar - are really the only nightclubs. 

If you are into beer, I would 100% recommend the Brewing Projekt. They have very unique craft beers, I love their stouts, and their whole space is cool - it’s like a big warehouse with big tables, people bring their dogs and their children. They don’t serve food so you can bring in your own. They have board games and cards you can borrow. 

Now, in terms of other places to hangout, coffee shops are great. Downtown, Shift is neat. It’s a coffee + bike repair shop, and if you like to bike, in the warmer months they do community bike rides. Racy’s is a cool coffee house. It’s on water street and they have live jazz music some evenings - it’s mentioned the day of on their instagram. 

Not sure where you’re from but WI has a nice culture. People are kind and will look out for you, so make sure to talk to them.

"I have known Howard since I was in 2nd grade in our Cub Scout pack. We are in marching band together and really are good friends. Since it’s senior year and we have never went to prom we want to go this year and wanted one of our friends prom king. So Howard volunteered and since then we have been making posters, business cards and an instagram account @vote.howard  however our school district told us our posters had to be approved by the school and since they were not we could no longer hand out anything physical. So we took to emailing as many kids in our grade as possible. But once again the school was upset. This time some of us were suspended for this Monday and threatened no prom. So we made a merch store because there is nothing in our dress code against it. Howard himself bought our merch along with 5 others so far. It is nonprofit to make them as cheap as possible.

"Love the downvotes on a question asking personal experiences.   To elaborate, the staff was rude to my 3 year old daughter... on her birthday.   The only reason we went is she was finally old enough to ride the go karts.  After waiting in line for 45+ minutes, the snot nose 17 year old at the end of the line said she wasn't old enough without proof.   Like I'm supposed to go home and get her birth certificate.  We left immediately.   I bought her a motorcycle instead.     She's a natural motorsports athlete.  This was 7 years ago.   I've never been back and I've told this story to anyone who asks.

"Well, it depends a lot on the job itself. I haven't been to Des Moines specifically, but I have been to Cedar Rapids, Iowa City and Dubuque.

Northeastern Iowa around the Tri-State area is absolutely *beautiful* country, but very rural. I've spent quite a lot of time there taking day trips from EC.

Unfortunately the rest of the state is pretty flat and not very scenic. If I got an offer for a really good job somewhere like Des Moines I'd probably take it as opposed to a not-so-good offer in the cities. But all things being completely equal, I'd prefer to stay in the area of the cities and/or Eau Claire.

There's just much more interesting country around here and to me it feels much more homey.

Another good option depending on the length of your trip is  using the airport shuttle service to drive you to Minneapolis so you don't have  to pay for parking.  They run vans all the time.

Not at all. That's the #1 reason we only stayed there one lease term. Otherwise the place was actually pretty nice for a college student, and the landlord was actually very professional and tended to issues promptly.

"Oh that does makes it much more difficult. We still had to have 4% down for our home, too. 

I do know some people rent from individuals instead of a company. They're usually more relaxed about dog rules.

I would also highly recommend putting together a renters packet. So something with a general application form or their specific application, pictures and biography of your dogs, and written  references of your dogs behaviors. Maybe even a reference letter from your current landlord on you and your dogs. I would recommend handing it in in person when you're touring the apartment. Maybe include an introduction letter with your photos so they remember you when they're reviewing your application later.  

We were able to rent in Menomonie by doing this when the company had a weight limit of 35 pounds. We requested a tour before submitting an application, then handed the renters packet over to the property manager with a prefilled out application. We had also included our credit scores and a bank statement (he still had to run an official credit report), but we were young with very little credit (640 scores at the time) so we just explained that in our renters packet.

"For downtown, The Livery or The District might be good options. I haven't been to The Livery since covid started, but I did hear that they're back to normal now. If you don't mind paying a little more, The Dive is the bar in the Lismore, and that might be an option.

The Mousetrap and Clancy's are kind of unique places, but I feel like you might think they're similar to The Joynt with that boy's club vibe a little bit.

Scooter's is like a grown-up, LGBT-friendly version of Shenans, if that makes sense. On the weekends, they have a DJ, and it's more of a club vibe, but you don't usually have to worry about people stumbling around and spilling their drinks.

My Office is, in my opinion, a shithole. I like townie, dive places and don't mind guys talking a little shit to each other. But the crowd at My Office is bad news. There have been some knives and guns pulled there over the past few years. So probably don't check out that one haha.

Most of the other downtown bars are kind of your classic townie crowd. Skews a little older and a little more male. Good chance of getting some rock or country on the touchtunes.

A few others have recommended Cowboy Jack's and Growler Guys. I would add Red Mixer, as well, if you want to get some fancier cocktails.

Pioneer, Pickle, The Brat, Brothers, and Shenans are all going to be more of your classic, very drunken college kid crowd, so stay away from each of those unless your mood changes as the night goes on.

"Very tough call. Overall, I'd probably say Mona Lisa's but that's more of a special-event type of place to eat so it's a rare occasion for me to have it. 

If I had to pick best food that I've actually eaten with any regularity then I'd have to go with Burritos Express. Even with the price increase its an incredibly delicious burrito that's pretty inexpensive. 

It's really hard to choose because there are a handful of other restaurants that I think serve tasty and interesting food options. 

I also love The Livery, or The Nuc (It'd be perfection if it wasn't 30-40 minutes to get a table), and Egg Rolls Plus is pretty good. Court'N House Burgers or Fish Fry is excellent and simple.

"I mean fair about being confused on the comments.  I was wondering the same thing myself.

I struggle with controlling my own frustration and anger too, so I get it.  I just won't post a comment if I think its going to be badly recieved.  

What I was trying to say was that not every place is going to be perfect and reevaluating what's important will help deal with the lack of other things.  Adapt, improvise and overcome, that sorta jazz.  If it's missing something you like, find something else or something new.  That's all I was trying to say.  

And while it's not always possible to plan a day trip to the Twin Cities, they do have a lot of stuff there that we don't have here.  Going a few times a year is a good way to destress, go to different shops, and go to the fair, concerts, games or whatever else catches your fancy.

"From your post in Green Bay, it didn't seem like you were really happy about moving period.  And yeah, I snooped.  I was trying to figure out what your issue is.  To me, it sounds like nothing would have made you happy and in return, you made a bunch of other people mad with your rants.

I think you need to reevaluate what's important to you when it comes to where you live.  Extras are nice and all, but the number of baseball teams and when a store was last updated isn't what's going to make you happy.

And if this is what you're like when you're upset about something, that might be why your wife doesn't communicate with you.  Not saying that's the issue, because obviously it runs a little deeper than that.  It's supposed to be a partnership with mutual respect and the things you've said about ""your woman"" don't give the impression that you're respectful towards her.

The Cavaliers are a baseball team.  The Express team is more popular, as far as I know, but I'm not a sports fan.

The Kohl's is near the Eau Claire Walmart, close to the Menards and Target.

And yeah, I agree, Fleet Farm and Farm & Fleet are overpriced usually.  But in your Wausau post, you asked about them, so I mentioned them.

"If you want a taste of general events offered in eau Claire and the Chippewa valley go to volumeone.org. it's a business that advertises tons of other business and especially events that are going on in the area.

If you're used to being within 15 minutes of major consumer shops and big events then be aware that Eau Claire is a medium-sized city that is not part of any greater-metro area. EC is the biggest city around it for at least 50 mi and is kind of a 'hub' for everything in that part of the state.

 It's very nice, especially for families, but when people want to see a show or do serious shopping they drive to Minneapolis. 

Eau Claire has a ton of community focused events that are generally inexpensive, but these are things like free live music (local bands mostly) in the parks in the summer or farmers markets and craft fair stuff.

EC is a very nice city, and the developers and city council have had ambitions to make it a bigger city, for better or worse, and there has been tons of development of the downtown area in the last decade. Because of the development it's getting more expensive to rent, and looking at Chippewa or Altoona are good options as they are very close to eau Claire.",t2_gm0y1,NixIsia,0,1641683297.0,0,t1_hru7ry0,hru7ry0,False,Raubueno,t3_rxfq6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eau_Claire/comments/rxfq6f/more_questions_about_the_area/,More questions about the area,/r/Eau_Claire/comments/rxfq6f/more_questions_about_the_area/hru7ry0/,2,r/Eau_Claire,0,2

"Eau Claire IS a college town, but all that really means is we have a lot of bars. Being Wisconsin, you are going to find bars all over the place anyway, no matter where you go. Some little towns have more bars than churches. Eau claire has a public transit (bus) system and so does Green Bay. The bus here does not run to Hallie or Chippewa, but it does go to Altoona. Not sure where all the bus goes in the GB area. 

The wages here in the Chippewa Valley tend to be lower than in many areas, including GB. Chippewa Valley is basically a retail hub, with the vast majority of jobs connected to retail in one way or another. However, there are also sizeable medical and technology industries here too. Eau Claire is like a small town living in a little ""metro,"" area. All of Northern WI tends to be very friendly people (or course there will always be some aholes, but overall very friendly and kind). We have clean air in the Chippewa Valley. It is not as clean in GB because they have more industry. That said, GB has a LOT to offer. The zoo, botanical gardens, Bay Beach (amusement park), easy/quick access to Door County, wonderful technical college and University, and of course our beloved GB Packers.",t2_cs81jpdt,everitnm,0,1641499966.0,0,t1_hrjcamk,hrjcamk,True,Raubueno,t3_rxfq6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eau_Claire/comments/rxfq6f/more_questions_about_the_area/,More questions about the area,/r/Eau_Claire/comments/rxfq6f/more_questions_about_the_area/hrjcamk/,1,r/Eau_Claire,0,1
"Eau Claire (Chippewa Valley area) has a lot less crime than Green Bay area does. If you like the great outdoors and freezing cold winter weather, this is the area for you. Snowshoeing, snowmobiling, skiing, ice skating, sledding, etc, are winter activities in abundance in all of Northern Wisconsin. Our area has wonderful elementary schools/education for children. We do not have the draw of the NFL team, and Green Bay has some bigger concerts because they actually have an entertainment/convention center, as does La Crosse (1.5 hours south of Chippewa Valley), whereas the entertainment center here is relatively new and seems like it is geared more toward theatre productions and orchestra type music events. It is certainly never going to be able to hold big money musical guests because there just is not enough seating to make it worth the effort for most acts. 

If you like warmer months outdoor activities, there is a lot to do here as well as in Green Bay area. Hiking, biking, boating, camping, fishing, hunting, etc. Green Bay has a wonderful zoo and botanical gardens, Chippewa Falls (Chippewa Valley) has a small local zoo. I believe the rents in the Chippewa Valley are cheaper than in Green Bay, but that may have changed. 

A drive to the local anything is typically about 10 to 15 minutes here in Chippewa Valley. It is about that or maybe a bit longer in Green Bay. Traffic is heavier in GB because the GB/Fox Valley area is more populated than the Chippewa Valley is. 

Rents are higher in Eau Claire than in say Hallie or Chippewa Falls, but you can find reasonable rents here.

"No Ikea. No Macy's/Nordstrom types. Yes Menards but no Lowe's or Home Depot, so no competition. Nearest Costco 75+ minutes away (I go 4-5 times a year). Rent is expensive.

Good hiking/snowshoeing, water sports, within a short distance. Nice trail for walking/running/biking right in town. YMCA is older but decent, many other gyms around are good.

"I've never gotten bored around this area, and I've been here most of my life. Yeah if you're big into nightlife and partying, there are bars and whatnot but no dance clubs really (Scooters is the only one that really comes to mind). There's a great focus on the arts and natural resources for this area, plus the Eau Claire Express baseball team has games at Carson Park in the summers. They are minor leagues, but games are fun and the stadium is really nice for its size. If you like league volleyball, I hear there are a lot of tavern leagues to become part of as well, and I forget which place it is, but they have a new-ish indoor sports arena for volleyball and whatnot to play. There's also Action City for things like go-karts and mini golf, the trampoline park, and the water park. That place is small, but is fun for a few hours of entertainment close by. If you like activities like board gaming, there are clubs and organizations in the area to get involved with that way, and they meet regularly. A lot of the game or comic book stores have regular game nights. And I don't know if they still do it, but Mayo Clinic and the Parks and Rec department usually have some flyers that list seasonal activities in the area like swimming, camps for adults and kids, the equestrian center, etc. Plus, if you really do need to go in search of more, St. Paul and Minneapolis are a short ride away.

"I'm guessing you've since gotten your answer, but there are 3 alarms in Eau Claire that you may hear than signify something other than police/fire/ems.

A constant steady tone siren for 3 minutes is the weather siren. Most who live here should know what they mean and when they are tested, thats never changed.

A increasing pitch (low to high, repeated) whooping sound is the Xcel energy Dam failure siren system. this is along the chippewa river north of riverview park all the way to cornell. Tests right after the weather sirens on the first monday. They are giant speaker towers and can also do PA announcements. In the event a dam upstream ever bursts, these cover all the areas along the river that ***will*** be under water in less than 15 minutes.

The third sirens are localized to all the Dams on the river, Lake Altoona, Dells Dam, Chippewa Hydro, Wissota Hyrdo, etc, they have a decreasing pitch (high to low, repeated), they go off \~15 seconds or so every 30 seconds for a few minutes 5 minutes before the flow rate of any of the above mentioned dams is going to *increase*, i.e. opening a gate wider.",t2_gzue595,JMAN123436,0,1641007590.0,0,t1_hqrkkdw,hqrkkdw,True,c0yboy,t3_rco0vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eau_Claire/comments/rco0vl/anyone_else_hear_that_weird_ass_siren_heard_it/,Anyone else hear that weird ass siren?

"I would recommend a stroll through Irvine park Christmas village (In Chippewa) with a thermos of hot chocolate. They have a great light setup and easy to walk through even while bundled up. Phoenix Park and River Prairie are also good areas for this, but not as good as Irvine in my opinion.

Afterwards you could then always hit up one of the close by restaurants, some of my top choices for date night would be Sheely House, Sakura, or Max's Bistro. There is also the option for checking out Leinie Lodge or Chippewa River Distillery. 

One date night I have planned is dinner at Johnny's Steak House, followed by a show at the Pablo. If we have time in between we might hit up The Dive inside of the Lismore hotel. 

The Cheers Pablo painting classes are also fun. 
Volume One also will list a lot of one off events in the area, so check those out. 

Another option is to do a horse drawn sleigh ride. I know they do it through Irvine Park, and downtown chippewa I think, and if you want a change of scenery you can do it through the woods at Cabin Ridge Rides (10-15 minutes from downtown chippewa). Not sure if the woods are lighted or not, I personally haven't done it.

I've also done snowshoeing on the trails at Lake Wissota State Park. Or Cross Country Skiing there, tower ridge, or some of the other trail locations but this may not be as good for an ""intimate"" type date. I think throughout the winter there is candlelight skiing or snowshoeing for after 5pm, but I've never done that yet (heard great things about it though). I'll have to look for the dates as they are published in the news or volume one. 

My last suggestion is a basic going out at one of the local breweries like Lazy Monk or Brewing Projekt, setting a table for some cribbage or another simple two player game. For this though I think it's a great double date with another couple if you have a good four person game like Catan or ticket to ride. I think Lazy Monk has board games there too.",t2_kf2it,Jared2j,0,1638968972.0,0,t1_hnpoos2,hnpoos2,True,loxim,t3_rbi1x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eau_Claire/comments/rbi1x4/date_ideas_for_winter/,Date ideas for winter?,/r/Eau_Claire/comments/rbi1x4/date_ideas_for_winter/hnpoos2/,7,r/Eau_Claire,0,7

"For a while I’ve been wanting to start a regular “classic movies” group where a bunch of old film geeks get together and watch and talk about classic movies.

Micon for a while had a rental theater program where a small group could rent a theater to watch whatever they wanted.

So I’m wondering if we find some interested people maybe we find a way to, once every week or so, rent a theater (if it’s still an option) for a private group showing with film crit after.

I would just do it myself but I think it’s like $100 or so to rent and that would get pricey fast. But if we find like 10 people who share this interest, talk with Micon, and do something like $20 membership dues, that gives us 2-4 meetings a month at cost.

After the appointment, I went back to complain about how the tattoo looked and both the owner of Rezurrection and Jeremy swore up and down that I wasn't taking proper care of it and that's why the color ran out and it scarred.  The color didn't even stay in when he was tattooing.  I asked another tattoo place what they thought and they told me straight up that he had gone too deep.

Work for Woodmans. They’re doing sign on bonuses and 15$/hr. It’s a great place and employee owned. You’d probably be able to move up too. Side note: there’s a lot of places that can help you with clothes. There’s public transportation. But housing may be hard to find. You may be in a tough spot but you’re worthy of respect and can find that at some jobs in town. They’re desperate for people so don’t settle for crappy jobs.

We’ve got a good amount of water, so kayaking, boating, and fishing are popular. Half Moon Lake and the Chippewa River are in town. Big Falls, Lake Altoona, and Lake Wissota are quick drives.
