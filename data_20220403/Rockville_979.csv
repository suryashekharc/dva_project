"Copying / pasting the contents of the [archived Geocities page](https://www.oocities.org/wellreadidiot/rockville.htm) here, to help preserve it in case that archive site ever goes down:

Rockville BMX was the greatest shop in the world. I remember going there as a kid and and just being in awe of all the stuff they had under one roof. The people that worked there were like GODS to me then. They had the power over the inventory of that place. My Mom used to drive me up to Hungerford Drive from Annapolis on my birthday and buy me a couple things I wanted. I wanted the whole store, but could usually pull it together enough to leave with a few items I just couldn't live without. I remember the day before we'd go I would dig through the catalogue and make a list of all the cool things I needed. Then I'd sit there for hours deleting things I know I couldn't convince her to buy. Then I'd whittle that list down even further to insure that I would get the main items I REALLY needed. Then, up until the time we actually got in the car and left, I'd look at the pics and figure out what colors I should get. By the time we got there I knew exactly what I wanted and what color. I'd walk through the front door....and I'd just go blank. Maybe it was the smell of the thousands of dollars of parts and clothing they had. Maybe it was the overload of just how much cool stuff was in sight. Whatever it was, it would run me over like a freight train and I'd have to be pushed in the door the rest of the way by my Mom. Sometime after this, I'd collect my jaw off the floor and go talk to whomever was working the front at the time. The employees were always the coolest and treated everyone like they were sponsered riders. That's what made that place so great.

Then in the summer ALL the major bike companies sent thier best teams to Rockville to perform. We'd go there like three hours early just to hang out with the riders and watch them practice. The store was ALWAYS a mob scene after the show, so we'd go to the store first and get some stuff and see what rider was in there getting hooked up. I remember seeing so many people there, and it was like those riders waited all year to come back there to see the shop employees. Every team that came through was like family in the shop. The vibe during the show was the best because the riders REALLY wanted to be there. They were almost more stoked on the show then the people who showed up to watch...and there were lots of people there. I remember 86' shows being almost twenty people deep around a huge area. You had to get there early to even get a spot up front. Which was the place to be! The announcers would always run around and get everyone screaming loud as hell. I think we were probably the most responsive crowd there was. I saw riders try the most insane stuff because we were yelling so loud. Sticker and product tosses were always mayhem too. After riding hard for an hour or so, the show would end and the riders would stick around and sign autographs for another hour sometimes. That's dedication! I have so many great memories of summer tours there.

Sometime in the early 90's, the owners decided they were going to move the shop closer to thier home in Arnold,MD. I was all for this since I lived a couple of miles from the proposed site. They moved the store into a small shopping center right off Route 2 in Arnold. This was quite a shock for most people and though the shop still did mail order through it's famous catalogue, business seemed to start disappearing. The shop move unfortunately coincided with a big drop off in the BMX/Freestyle scene all over the country. The scene further fell victim to the loss of budget in the industry and that the big companies were no longer throwing money at thier teams. Alot of riders were dropped and alot of companies went under during the big drought of the 90's. I imagine it was all the kids who used to buy the bikes ""grew up"" and got cars. The companies weren't able to reach a new generation of riders in time to keep the wheel rolling and lost thier target consumer. Some companies like VANS still sponsered people though. VANS sent Eddie Fiola and a couple of other riders out on the road in a Chevy Daully pulling a quarter pipe trailer set up to do shows. They came to Rockville BMX at the new location and did a show in a parking lot that was super small compared to the School Board parking lot off Hungerford Drive where all the big shows went down. It was great to see Eddie again and talk about the new store and the the tour. It was then that I realized that he wasn't going anywhere in the BMX/Freestyle scene. He's a super resourceful guy whose been around since day one and is still out there doing bike stunts in TV shows and Movies. Ask Gork next time you see him about Fiola riding a Redline now.

Soon after that show the shop fell victim to the decline of the industry. The Magazines were the first sign that there was trouble. Wizard Publications changed the name of FREESTYLIN' to GO- The Riders Manual. It was a sure sign that things were changing. I remember the day that Rockville BMX closed it doors. Even though I had supported them to the end, it was not enough. I was shocked that such a shop could actually close. Years later I applied to work at an Exxon station on Route 50 near Cape St. Clair. The person who interviewed me was Bryant. I was so happy to see him again after all the years that I'm sure I probably wouldn't shut up about the ""good ole days"". He gave me a job even though he seemed reluctant to talk about the closing of the shop. I didn't work there long, but just seeing him was a sort of closure for me...knowing that everyone moved on to other things. I haven't heard about any of the people involved with Rockville BMX in a long time, but I'm sure that they are all happy with the involvement they had in the sport. The store changed alot during it's history from Jay to Chuck and Bryant as owners, from Hungerford Drive to Arnold Station....but it was always Rockville BMX.

"Seconded. People there love to have their dogs get attention. 

If you're renting somewhere, I *believe* a doctor's prescription for an ESA can override housing rules (though ESAs still lack many protections that Service Animals have). If you're concerned about commitment, you can always sign up to be a foster family. A pet also doesn't have to be an expensive cat or dog: rats are smart little critters and make good pets. 

While some shelters don't allow potential adopters to play with the animals (some do, some don't), they do hire volunteers to provide daily cuddles, socialization, and walks for animals awaiting adoption.

You can also consider doing things like signing your daughter up for horse riding lessons or--depending on her age--encourage her to look for a part-time job involving animals. 

However, if there's any way at all to make it happen, nothing helps the way having your own pet does, and it really does make a significant impact on mental health. You might ask her therapist for guidance and suggestions.",t2_9a4jx0ol,iamthe0ther0ne,0,1645022430.0,0,t1_hx6e3au,hx6e3au,False,AbrasiveSandpiper,t3_snp27y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockville/comments/snp27y/emotional_support_animals/,Emotional support animals?,/r/Rockville/comments/snp27y/emotional_support_animals/hx6e3au/,1,r/Rockville,0,1

"It somehow seems obvious that this would be true, but a 3 year study in Great Britain, where they do turn off or dim the street lamps, shows that this is not the case.

Having good lighting may deter some crimes in some situations, but as far as street lamps go, they don't change the crime (or accident) rate.

In another case I read about, there was a building that was continually being vandalized with graffiti. By removing the lights from the area, they were depriving the vandals of the light they needed to do their tagging.

"Rockville ""can annex land without owners’ consent in some circumstances, including when land is tax exempt, like the site of the Shady Grove Metro station."" Presumably, since your neighborhood has already been developed, you're not going to be annexed. Unless your HOA petitions for it, maybe. The undeveloped land around Shady Grove metro that remains in WMATA's tax-exempt control is much more likely to be annexed, I'd imagine.

"311? Home Depot? Sounds like a lot of non-city commenters. In Rockville proper you can only have 1 city-provided trash bin and 1 city-provided recycling bin per household. Some residents put out more and if the trash men are in a good mood they'll empty them, but I've also seen them simply toss the whole extra bin in the back of the garbage truck and compact it.

If you have extra trash beyond what fits into your bin, the city instructs you to put up to 5 garbage bags next to your bin. If you have more trash than that you're suppose to call the city and set up a free bulk trash pickup appointment.

"Here's a [potential annexation map](https://i.imgur.com/eb5xPgR.png) from [the municipal growth](https://www.rockvillemd.gov/DocumentCenter/View/42821/City-of-Rockville-Comprehensive-Plan---Municipal-Growth-Element---single-page-SQUARE) section of [Rockville's 2040 plan](https://www.rockvillemd.gov/2183/Master-Plan-by-Chapter)...

Policy 2Re-establish a working arrangement withthe City of Gaithersburg and MontgomeryCounty governments in regard to logicalannexations.

In 1992, Montgomery County government and the citiesof Rockville and Gaithersburg signed a memorandum ofunderstanding that established a framework for annexationthat was to be followed for a “twenty-year planning horizon.”That horizon ended in 2012 and no subsequent agreementhas been discussed since then.

Montgomery County government continues to plan for asignificant amount of development just beyond Rockville’smunicipal boundaries. State of Maryland law requiresmunicipalities to complete a municipal growth element. Tothe north and northwest are areas that could potentiallyannex into Rockville, or Gaithersburg, since both the citiesof Gaithersburg and Rockville have overlapping areas intheir maximum expansion limits, or remain outside of both inMontgomery County.

In areas just outside Rockville’s city limits, the Countycontinues to allow growth in both jobs and residential units.For instance, the County’s Shady Grove Sector Plan, GreatSeneca Science Corridor Master Plan, and its White FlintSector Plans 1 and 2 all envision major activity centers withthousands of jobs and new residential units. This growth canbe beneficial to the city, but also impacts roadway capacitywithin the city and capacity for other County-controlledcommunity facilities, schools in particular. Rockville’s MELincludes portions of these County growth areas, whichprovide the City some ability to engage with the County andlandowners in planning for land development at the city’sborders.

It is in the City’s best interest to engage in active discussionwith the City of Gaithersburg and Montgomery Countygovernments regarding a shared understanding onannexation since it is likely that Rockville and Gaithersburgwill continue to annex land from the County in the ShadyGrove Road area.",t2_h6qa2,acommentator,0,1642196232.0,0,t1_hsolch1,hsolch1,True,edub114,t3_s3jh7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockville/comments/s3jh7o/shady_grove_annexation/,Shady Grove Annexation,/r/Rockville/comments/s3jh7o/shady_grove_annexation/hsolch1/,1,r/Rockville,0,1

"Check out adsbexchange.com they don't filter out flights like FR24 and the others, so military is more likely to show up. 270 is a helicopter route so lots of medevac, most notably the red Sky Bear from children's national and yellow medstar. A group of Blackhawks takes off from the Pentagon and flies up 270 to Raven Rock every Thursday morning.   
If you want to get into the hobby further consider setting up your own adsb receiver and feed to the various sites. They all have directions and raspberry pi images to make it easy, you can do it for about $40 (cheaper if you get a free pi from microcenter). A lot of what you're seeing on these sites is coming from my feed and others in the area. While coverage in our area is great it never hurts to have more receivers.

You're right out of college, and while it's really good to have an idea of what you want to do going forward (it's more than I had!), you should also rest assured that you've still got a few years to ""live it up"" before the really meaningful career choices start hitting.

"It would depend on where in Rockville your office will be but realistically speaking you should probably budget at least an hour and fifteen minutes, possibly even an hour and thirty minutes each way since you’ll have to switch trains at Gallery Place and will possibly have to take additional time to get from the station to your office.  I did a similar commute for a couple of years, having to switch to yellow from red and after a while it really wore me out. The trip is also going to be the highest metro fare so you should budget that in as well if your company is not paying for your commute.

If you can live closer to any of the red line stops in NW you may be able to shave some time but you should still be prepared for a long commute either way. Ideally if you’re relying on public transport it would be most advisable to live in Rockville or as close as you can. You may be able to find some affordable options in MoCo that may be more cost effective than living in DC.

"The context is that King Farm, like Clarksburg, was envisioned as a smart growth development (although in the latter case, that was a bit of a farce). Residents would ostensibly use Shady Grove Metro to commute, and there would also be a substantial number of new high-wage office jobs located right in the community.

But because the demand for office space in Montgomery County hasn't been what it was before, the developers at King Farm have sought - and received - approval on several occasions to have the land zoned at King Farm for additional office buildings (beyond what you see there today) converted to residential zoning for more townhomes.

So what we've ended up with are more residents in King Farm than originally proposed, and fewer jobs for them to walk to, as opposed to commuting on the roads.

"They were swanky in comparison. Petty much brand new construction and a decently responsive maintenance crew considering the size of the place. The hallways were louder (Huntington's are all outside so quieter) and the walls and floors are pretty thin but not unbearably so. I lived on the corner on the top floor in Huntington so I don't have any to compare against there. The gym is nice but the pool sucks (freezing cold and very shallow). The lounge area is nice and there is a free coffee machine (at least precovid). Packages can be a mess since the package room is very small and anything after hours usually get left outside the main door since it requires key access to even to get into the lobby.its also a weird situation where every floor needs a specific key to access so firefighters and first responders cannot get in without help of someone who lives on your exact floor (would make me nervous if I had kids or health problems). Whole building waited outside for a hour on a smoke alarm once bc fire fighters couldn't even get to the apartment with the issue. Worst part is that everything except the metro station is not he other side of 355. Drivers are very aggressive, especially around rush hours. Expect to have close calls with asshole drivers in the intersection. 

I pretty much listed the absolute worse things but it's still a good building.

"Lived there with a (probably illegal looking back on it) sublet for 6 months. It was pretty good. I like the King Farm area, very dog friendly. If you have kids I think half of them (the southern half) are in a ""better"" school district but not sure for what ages. The gym is okay but the best part is there is an outdoor pool and a small indoor lap pool for resident use. For sure a little older apartments than others in the area and my AC in the summer was garbage but I had a corner bedroom with more window and sun so that might have been my issue. I lived in the Bainbridge apartments for two years after that and (at least pre covid) the price point was surprisingly the same for a two bedroom. Downside is you need to cross 355 all the time in the Bainbridge apartments. Also 355 can be loud if your place faces it.

I have no idea what smell these people are talking about. I have a very sensitive nose and I lived, walked a half mile to work everyday, and routinely had a running route directly past the Transfer Station (its not an actually dump, its mostly recycling) multiple times  and never smelled any foul odder from it. I don't live in the area any more but I still work and occasionally run there and haven't noticed a change.

"Live there. King farm is a nice quiet neighborhood for the most part, great for us to walk our dogs. We chose the apartments because of that and the space we could get for the money. And amenities are decent. Overall we enjoy it, plus it’s a short drive to places like crown or Kentlands which are a bit livelier.

It does seem to be a bit older, our unit has had a number of issues with the appliances (a/c wasn’t great in summer and had to be replaced, washing machine broke, water heater leaked).

This appears to stop after 2019, but the reported data clearly shows an increase in rape in Montgomery County in the most recent 5 years available, which is higher than in any other 5 year period since 1975.  Clearly it would be more helpful to see what that looks like on a per capita basis, but I happen to think that the fact that rape has become more common even while other types of violent crime have decreased is concerning and worth discussion.

"""Laid back"" is subjective- I agree with that. Personally, my experience differs from yours, where people seem reserved here and willing to do things along since you can. Most people here seem content with only their dog and/or spouse, but I rarely see groups of friends unless in DC at a bar/restaurant. 

I made many great connections in AZ and Cali that I still talk too, but to be fair, I think grad school definitely allowed those connections to flourish. Frankly, isolation seems to be a growing trend as a part of America's structure and we are slowly realizing that.

"Great summary👍

I especially agree with the negative car oriented landscape here and throughout the DMV. The metro being close is nice but it doesn’t go everywhere. If anyone moves here, I would highly recommend a car even tho we have the Metro. When you’re walking, prepared to do a lot of it and a lot of standing by the crosswalk waiting to cross. I do wish that the Rockville Pike had a few pedestrian bridge is to make it easier to connect the two sides. It would also help if there are more open spaces near the pike as well although you do get more of that such as Rock Creek Park.

"> 2) It’s basically strip malls, industrial parks, townhouse communities & apartment complexes, houses are very close together, lots of people, not a ton of open space that isn’t crowded.

It's funny, because I'd call this an upside. I grew up in cookie-cutter suburban sprawl, and it's awful. You couldn't walk or bike anywhere meaningful and there's no public transit to speak of. Still isn't. I much prefer Rockville as it's a nice balance between the ""space"" of suburban sprawl and the density of DC proper.

"I moved here in June. Impressions so far:

Pros:

\- Good access to nature. Rock Creek Regional Park is really nice, Great Falls and Sugarloaf Mountain are \~30 mins away. A lot of the residential areas also have great trees and landscaping.

\- Good, diverse food options. I've had Chinese (Bob's Shanghai), Thai (Farmsook), Indian (Spicelife), tacos (Ixtapalapa, Taco Bamba), and Peruvian chicken (Poyoteca) that were all among the best I've had in the last few years. There are still a ton of highly rated places I haven't tried yet.

\- One of the highest vaccination rates in the country.

\- Solid farmers markets in downtown Rockville and Pike and Rose

\- It is served by the main metro system, not just regional rail. A lot of other DC suburbs have this too, but it most US suburbs outside of the DC area don't.

\- Outside of rush hour the drive to DCA, Arlington, Georgetown usually isn't too bad (\~35 mins).

Cons:

\- It is very car oriented. There are some pedestrian friendly shopping centers, but you still have to drive to get to them. There are some nice bike trails/lanes, but many seem to be intended mostly for recreation. In many cases there is not a particularly direct bike friendly route between places.

\- The pike often has bad traffic and the view from it is mostly pretty hideous.

\- I can't complain too much about the metro given that we have it better than most cities, but getting downtown does take 45+ mins. Also the Rockville and Shady Grove stations are closed until Dec 4th.

\- If there is traffic, the drive to DCA, etc. can take an hour or more.

\- There is good food, but there aren't many good complete dining experiences. Generally, the places that have decent ambience have mediocre food and the places with good food are in strip malls.

\- There isn't a huge amount of nightlife. Pike & Rose has a little bit and maybe Downtown Crown too, but that's about it. My partner and I were at Saints Row brewing at 7:30 on a Saturday night a few weeks ago and we were the only ones there.

\- As others have said, housing is pricey, especially considering how far we are from DC.",t2_j30wp,champdave,0,1634054454.0,0,t1_hgd9erf,hgd9erf,True,a14049752,t3_q66usp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockville/comments/q66usp/whats_the_worst_part_of_living_in_rockville/,What's the worst part of living in Rockville,/r/Rockville/comments/q66usp/whats_the_worst_part_of_living_in_rockville/hgd9erf/,8,r/Rockville,0,8

The downsides are it's very heavily developed with no signs of slowing down, which means housing costs are extremely high and the market is very competitive.

There are beer/wine stores in just about every strip mall (which there are a lot of), but if you want to stock up on liquor for your party, you have to go to a county store. The county stores are not as conveniently located, and have shorter hours than the private liquor stores in less regulated areas.

"I passed by several minutes after it happened.  It was wild.  A WMATA employee told me someone cut off the bus and she swerved.  I was told only the driver of the red minivan was seriously hurt. 

It was wild, there was the minivan that was under the bus, a white Porsche SUV whose front end was crushed, a Subaru station wagon that had its rear end caved in, some damage to the front, and was straddling the median like a 50-50 grind, and a black Camry that was completely spun around and over the curb.  

I think the car behind the Porsche had minor damage.  So really four cars that were damaged to the point they couldn't be driven away.

Basically this bus swerved and hit a bunch of cars that were either turning left off the Pike onto Congressional, or were waiting at a red light waiting to cross/turn left onto the Pike.

It was super wild and there were at least 50 people gawking at everything.  Police had yellow tape giving them space, there were about 10 cops and 10 WMATA employees taking statements and stuff.

The bus driver was fine, just shaken up, and was sitting on the ground talking to paramedics and cops calmly.

Also the bus was a shuttle bus providing service for passengers that would otherwise be using the Shady Grove/Rockville metro stations which are closed for canopy repairs.

"Oh lol. When I did jiu-jitsu, I went to Standard BJJ, but I've been to Yamasaki a few times. They're just expensive.
