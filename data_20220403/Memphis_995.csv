In 1891 Elias Lowenstein built this mansion which is the cities most important Victorian Romanesque residence and one of the finest of its styles in the South. After his death in 1919, his family donated it to the Nineteenth Century Club for use as a residence for young working women who did not have family in the city and, therefore, under social customs of the day were expected to live in a protected environment.

"Hickory Hill? It's not a great area of town anymore, but I don't think there are a lot of gangs and/or meth labs, just a lot of lower income people and vacant businesses. I grew up there when it was booming so my nostalgia might be clouding my opinion of it though. 

Up Kirby towards Germantown is probably the best area. I knew some people that lived at Kirby Station and they thought it was decent enough- just looking it up now a 1 bed is $1133. Holy shit. It used to be cheap. There may be some other options in that area though.

I'd avoid being closer to Winchester west of, say, Hacks Cross. That area was also pretty decent. A lot of FedEx workers still have crashpads over there, so I'm assuming it's not that bad. Fieldstone looks to start at $1339 though. Damn. The rent is too damn high. 

Ross road used to be pretty decent, a lot of smaller homes. There might be some ok places off Shelby Drive, but I'm not really sure about that.

I personally probably wouldn't look at anything west of Hickory Hill Rd and Winchester. That area may be ok but I'm less familiar with it.

Your issue is going to be schools. Kirby High has some issues. I'm less familiar with Ridgeway, but I think they are similar in that regard. I'm not familiar with any of the elementary/middle schools in that area. They may be decent. 

I would steadfastly avoid anything near the airport. I worked down there for years and just no. 

If you're ok with a commute, Millington/Atoka/Munford might have something reasonable. The Woodland in Atoka gets you down to a starting price of $1015. Apparently Munford is one of the safest cities in TN according to the Google.

There's a place called Highland Chateau out in Raleigh/Bartlett that is cheap AF, but I'm not too familiar with that area. That starts at $745.

"Reading through your comments, you sound like me back when I was 25.  

You have no idea what you want to do, no real direction.  Take a look at South West  Tennessee Counity College website and see if anything looks good.  If you graduated from a Tennessee school, it's free.  Doesn't matter that you immediately didn't go to college, it's free.  Id advice to look at either trades, or STEM that can transfer to Memphis.  

What I did was I went to STCC, got my AS in Parallel Engineering (which is a useless degree but all credits transfer to Memphis for their engineering degree), went to Memphis and signed up for Mechanical Engineering, and graduated at the age of 30.  Now, I'm working at a manufacturing facility making 4 times what I was making pre college.  

Find a trade at STCC, Plumbers electricians, machining, etc. all make good money doing rewarding work.  If something in STEM interest you, it might take loans but it's not the end of the world.  Hell, I'm going back for my MBA now.  I'm hoping the ROI is there, but it could lead to no promotions.  You have to try.

All this is if you want to go the college route.  Nobody is forcing you to go to college.  If someone is forcing you to go, hopefully they are helping to cover the cost.

"No one is supposed to be anything, and worthwhile is completely subjective. The advantage of college is access to knowledge and a degree that will potentially open up career opportunities in the future. One could choose to think of it as an investment. It does take a lot of work, but the work gets done one step at a time, and it's possible to learn to enjoy the journey.

Unless you were born into a mega-rich family, the rest of your life will be spent either working or going to school. It's not like there's a vacation. After having worked full time, it has become easier to conceptualize school in a similar manner: just like work where you follow a schedule, I follow a schedule for myself with school, during which time I work on the assignments I have. If I don't know how to do something, I ask for help. If I have finished everything that is due immediately, then I use the time I set aside to work on something else that will come due sooner or later. The hard part is being able to hold oneself accountable, instead of a boss doing so.

As a result, though, I will end up being able to do what I want to do for work, which is to be a psychologist. If, however, you don't feel as if you desire to do anything that would require a degree, and you are comfortable with the lifestyle you expect to live without a degree, or you feel like you could benefit from trying out what it's like in the working world without a college degree, then there is nothing that says you have to go to college :)",t2_w2ssq,red-writer,0,1648989995.0,0,t1_i37ua3h,i37ua3h,True,JustCallMeTsukasa-96,t3_tv2a79,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphis/comments/tv2a79/is_is_wise_to_apply_for_college_let_alone_to_a/,Is is wise to apply for college?

"I'm moving out of there this month. My husband fell down the broken stairs and when we reported it to management, they told us to let them know if his injury got worse...

But they didn't give us any notice that they were so one day we opened the door and didn't have stairs and couldn't get to work. There was also a hole in the window that was still there when we moved in. The roads are awful and there's garbage alllll over the roads.  Trash piles up so much that their are additional dumpsters like the kind you see at construction sites. People get evicted all the time and their furniture gets left by the dumpsters too. Our mailbox has been broken into multiple times. There's teenagers that roam around with pellet guns which is where we think the hole in the window came from. They say they have a pool and gym but the gym equipment is not put together properly so its not safe and the pool has been abandoned ""for covid.""

"Flaming Star nebula (IC 405) is an emission and a reflection nebula located in the constellation of Auriga. It lies about 1500 light years away and spans about 5 light years. The central blue region is from light reflecting off of dust granules from the nearby star AE Auriga. The hydrogen emission gas makes up the flame while the blue reflection nebula resembles smoke.

"Yes. I have a pretty heavy tolerance to thc so I thought they wouldn’t do much but now I enjoy taking delta 8 gummies more than regular ones. The dose of delta 8 is roughly half the strength of delta 9 so if you take normally 100mg edible then I would almost double that for delta 8. Give it a few tries with different brands. Some are much better than others. I use hylyfe 100mg gummies I get them at the shell gas station on new Byhalia in collierville. But there’s also a great place here in Collierville that makes their own high quality gummies, tinctures and bud. It’s in the Cheers liquor store shopping center called TN Roots. You can find them on Insta @tn_roots. Really good quality. I find delta 8 gives a well-being feeling and def makes you sleepy. With my tolerance I take about 200-250 mg delta 8. But my sister who only
Smokes every now and then takes only 20mg to get where she’s trying to go. It just takes a little trial and error but once you find the sweet spot dosage you’ll know. What dosage did you take and are you a regular smoker?

"Lol. I guess college just wasn’t for me. I clicked with a more hands on education working in tv and movies. I’ve had careers that don’t really require a degree. 
I knew a guy that graduated from MUS and didn’t even apply to colleges because he was entering the Canadian hockey league (I think it was Canadian) so the school offered to pay his application fees just so they could keep the claim that all students were accepted to colleges. Lol

Part of it too was that I didn’t have a great educational background before getting to MUS. I struggled to a degree there and my grades sucked. I had a hard time getting accepted to colleges and ended up at the U of M. Once there I had to take some lower level intro classes that were covering things I’d done in 9th grade. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the maturity to just do the work and get passed that and into the classes that would challenge me. I allowed myself to get frustrated and stopped going to class opting instead to go to work at the tv station I was working for. There in worked hands on building sets, lighting shows, and learning full tv production and directing. I failed out. I tried over the years to go back but they kept saying I needed to get a 2 year degree first and then they’d think about it. By that time I was in career number two and just didn’t feel like doing all of that. 

So, my point was really that while the quality of the school is certainly important, the individual also plays a great role in the educational outcome. So, if comparing WSHS to another school, try to take the kids personality etc into account along with the schools academic performance.",t2_34bgk,kipgordon,0,1648759458.0,0,t1_i2wa9tv,i2wa9tv,False,[deleted],t3_tsyqlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphis/comments/tsyqlv/is_white_station_a_good_high_school/,Is white station a good high school?,/r/memphis/comments/tsyqlv/is_white_station_a_good_high_school/i2wa9tv/,1,r/memphis,0,1

They decided that all new stations being built west of the Mississippi river begin with the letter K. The University of North Texas (UNT) applied for a new radio station and for the callsign they just used their schools initials with a K in front (KUNT).

">how they determine rent increases, and by how much, seems to be bullshit

That is the part that was nonsense.  You're trying to tell the free market that they can't operate in the free market.  The people who own the property get to set the rent.  The potential renters then decide if they are willing to pay that price.  Let's say rent prices were in a free-fall.

"Hurricane is one of the smoother high gravity malts, but not the best either. It’s definitely alcohol forward, with low bitterness(hops are barely used in malt liquor), less sweet than a standard malt, and a heavy grain/corn flavor (standard for malts). Colt 45 high gravity is the best, followed by Ice House edge, Hurricane, St. Ides, Steel Reserve HG, Old English HG, then the dregs such as Camo Silver and Black Ice, Earthquake and possibly the worst beer I ever recall having “Evil Eye”. 

Anheuser Busch is very reactionary in all of their malt liquors. BudweiserMalt Liquor was made in 1971 in a (late) response to Colt 45s success with the African American market and eventually was rebranded as King Cobra in 1984. Similarly Hurricane was released in 1996 as a counter to the success of the new high gravity malt liquors (higher ABV), such as St. Ides, that were gaining popularity, but it was originally heavily marketed to the Latino market which caused some heat for AB.",t2_xck31,B1gR1g,0,1648692702.0,0,t1_i2sp9ra,i2sp9ra,False,B1gR1g,t3_tslumi,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphis/comments/tslumi/looks_like_a_hurricane_came_through_my_backyard/,Looks like a hurricane came through my backyard,/r/memphis/comments/tslumi/looks_like_a_hurricane_came_through_my_backyard/i2sp9ra/,8,r/memphis,0,8

having grown up in mid-missouri, I've become pretty accustomed to this haha. we get storms like this probably 10-15 times a year in that area.

"Bigotry and racism are both themselves rooted in ignorance. However, it's the foolish kind of ignorance that foolishly and completely believes it knows the truth about things more than anyone else when it clearly doesn't. Being ignorant isn't the problem. We are all ignorant about lots of things outside of our experiences and education. However, we now have a lot of people thinking they know more than the experts on things that are far outside of their expertise. We see it with things like COVID, CRT,  global warming, healthcare, abortion, LGBTQIA+ issues, poverty issues, etc. Yes your friend, like most, lived in a social and economic bubble. The way to fight the ignorance that causes bigotry, racism, and to some extent greed is having some connected experiences with people from those groups. Shows like Undercover Boss demonstrate how that works. How many times did the boss realize that the work was far harder than they imagined and that the pay wasn't nearly enough for their struggling employees? That only happened because they experienced what it was like being that employee and connected with those employees. It allowed them to tie into their empathy. 

I've been on both sides of this issue. I grew up in a very religious environment in the south. I was taught bigoted and racist views growing up. I've been through the process of identifying, confronting and correcting those views. It's a hard thing to do and there are so many thought processes that just seemed ""normal"" and even ""logical"" at the time that were hurtful to others. Logic is only as good as the information supplied to that logic. It can change drastically when more information is added. Many of the racist bigoted conservatives have ""logical"" reasons for their beliefs but they either don't know or choose ignore and dismiss tons of information to that would conflict with their conclusions.",t2_ag9zz,tri_it,0,1648676926.0,0,t1_i2rqcfl,i2rqcfl,False,memphisjones,t3_tqxonf,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphis/comments/tqxonf/tn_gop_lawmakers_lead_charge_to_ban_local/,TN GOP lawmakers lead charge to ban local governments from preventing pipelines in their communities,/r/memphis/comments/tqxonf/tn_gop_lawmakers_lead_charge_to_ban_local/i2rqcfl/,1,r/memphis,0,1
