"Disagree that real estate won't appreciate.  The economics now are completely different than 2008.  There is no subprime situation like back then, and no inventory glut.  Unemployment is very low.

Inventory is incredibly tight now, and I have no idea if/when that will improve.  The variable there could be mortgage interest rates, but even then it would take a huge increase to really impact prices.  Even a recession might not make a big dent.  Nobody is building starter homes because of all kinds of stupid reasons.  You want a new house?  Prepare to spend at least $500k, and probably a lot more anywhere near the 694/494 beltway.

Last year some builders tore down the very old house across the street from us.  They preserved a detached garage because that was much newer and quite usable.  So they built a huge house attached to it.  They left the existing, somewhat beat-up asphalt driveway.  Selling price was $785k for a new house with only a double-car garage.

"I learned it from my mom.  Everyone's hotdish is different, and she didn't use tater tots though. Hers was usually a cut up fryer chicken, salt and pepper, two boxes of wild and long grain rice (including the seasoning packets if they are separate in the box). She'd dice up a couple big carrots, couple stalks of celery, an onion and then mix in a can of cream of celery, a can of cream of mushroom, can of cream of chicken and some water or milk to thin it out.  Some pepper and maybe paprika on the top for some color.  Cover in foil, bake at 350-375 until chicken and rice are done. Probably about 45 mins.  Take foil off and broil to get some browning.

" I can‚Äôt give any advice on pros/cons for buying now with plans to sell in 5-7 years. My initial gut is more risk than reward in that plan because the housing market has skyrocketed in the past 1.5-2 years.  If prices continue in current trajectory, you‚Äôll be in good shape.  Or otherwise stagnant and you‚Äôll won‚Äôt be able to unload.  

Then again, interest rates are higher now than when I bought a year ago, and are only going to go up.  That makes me think that if you decide to buy, now would be the time rather than later. 

What I can advise you on is using VA loan. It‚Äôs definitely an awesome route, but I had a hard time finding a place because I was using VA loan. Primary reason was because VA requires the house to appraise for the value of the mortgage and this is non-waiverable. Many buyers were waiving inspections and appraisals, which made them more attractive to the sellers.  Many buyers were making offers far above asking price, and likely appraisal value of the home. 

I lost out on several houses because I would not waive inspection, could not waive appraisal, and was not willing to cough up 30k+ cash to cover the difference between low appraisal and the asking price. 

Not telling you this to discourage you, but to prepare you for some of the disadvantages of using a VA loan in the current market.

I don't know if there is an actual, vetted, study done on which tribe takes majority. The Census data we rely on for population just generalizes it to Native American. I'm an Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) in the cities, and frequent my Native communities. I anecdotally have encountered more Anishinaabe than Dakota living here. However, going slightly south of the cities, it has definitely been vice versa

There has been quite the long history of displacement. A lot of Anishinaabe came to Minnesota as part of the early migration pre -colonial contact. Than furthered increased in the cities from various Midwest reservations due to the 1950s-1970s Indian Relocation Program.

Many Dakota have also been migrated out. A lot of the tribes seem to exist in the South, but the population really got displaced in 1863 when the Dakota(Sioux) Ban was enacted as a federal response to the 1862 Dakota Uprising

Get a realtor and solid lender in your court as allies.  This costs you nothing.  Buyer agents are paid by the seller and only if and when you close on a home.

See what you get for that money and make your decision after comparing thay to the lifestyle you want for yourself.  Don't try to time the market, i dont see the point in making major life decisions that far out.  Fed is increasing rates and lenders have to constantly review new rates.  They've doubled this year, which gives you less buying power the further we get into the year.  

Think about your exit strategies.  Your mortgage will be fixed, so why not consider renting instead of selling in the event you want to leave.

Lastly, if you are certain you'll be around for that long, I think it's just an obvious choice from a net worth standpoint.  Do some quick math assuming 3% annual appreciation over 5 years, assume less if you are fearful of a drop, and assume equity pay down.  Add those for a total equity estimate in year 5.  Then add up what rent would be over 5 years, assuming increases and decide that way.  If you're a numbers person it is a clear choice, if it's a lifestyle you favor, which renting enables you, it may not be as clear.

"45 years as a pro chef I have some tips for add flavor and texture.

Use 80/20 beef.  Have  the pan heated to at least 350 and add the beef in small pieces. You want caramelized browned beef not grayed beef.  When the beef is 80 per cent done season with salt, pepper and granulated garlic. Add some dehydrated onions and just a little bit of water and simmer until the onions are hydrated. This will flavor the beef through and you won't get pockets of bland beef in the final product. After draining off excess fat mash the beef with a potato masher. 

If you can deep fry, air fry or just pre cook the tots in a 425 over the texture will be sublime.

Make a mushroom soup from scratch. Don't cheap out. Use heavy cream and good beef base or beef stock. Do not use bouillon cubes or powdered base.

Siracha or sambal are great in the soup

Briefly cook the frozen veggies in the soup. 

After thickening the soup with corn starch slurry add the cheese. Use extra sharp cheddar fine shred. Mild cheddar wont have enough flavor.",t2_3drzjgmr,gadgetsdad,0,1648951477.0,0,t1_i369js6,i369js6,True,seabass629,t3_tuxmeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/tuxmeh/tater_tot_hotdish/,Tater Tot Hotdish,/r/minnesota/comments/tuxmeh/tater_tot_hotdish/i369js6/,66,r/minnesota,0,66

No, I think some of this is at least partially systemic, which is also not mutually exclusive from individual police departments having uniquely poor history, performance, or community relations.

They (phone companies and their successors) have literally been given money repeatedly, going back as far as the 1990s, to expand rural Internet access, but they've never done anything but explain why they can't do it and ask for more money.

As for ""cooperatives""... the same communications companies want it to be illegal everywhere in the state for any form of wireless or wired communications to be created as a community initiative - no city wide WIFI, no rural point to point wireless, no sharing of or leasing the existing POTS network to enable small internet providers to pick up the slack.   

That's the major reason a lot of small Internet providers went out of business around the year 2000 - it became impossible to offer high speed service via the POTS network (public owned) because the existing phone companies cut off access to prevent competition.   All the small Internet companies could offer was dial-up which couldn't compete.  Prior to this they had been able to lease ""dry copper"" from the network, basically a cross connected pair of copper wires from point A to point B.   Using DSL technology they could offer T1 class lines via relatively inexpensive DSL modems.

The phone companies didn't want any competition, so they pushed to restrict the POTS network (again, a public network built with public money) to their use only.

Nowadays, it's mostly wireless companies that don't want anyone offering data services, and they don't even bother with trickery, they just lobby towns, counties, and the state to ban public networks of any kind.

Rural broadband isn't happening because the incumbent communications companies don't want it to happen, not because it's completely unprofitable.  Companies like Comcast don't build out rural networks because they don't have to.. there's no competition, and no one is making them do it.

"Unsustainable market hunting was abolished and we now have what's called the North American Conservation Model where the populations are studied and hunters can only take a certain amount.   *Sometimes we take very few animals and then eliminate the season entirely for fear of harming the population (moose), sometimes we shoot a fair amount to manage the population (whitetail deer), and sometimes we have increasingly liberal regulations and limits to help control a population (geese). It all depends on the critter and the year.

Plus the landscape changed into a sea of corn and beans with parcels of woods in between- which is pretty good for deer populations too, as it turns out. 

Wolves were pretty well extirpated but now coyotes occupy a lot of terrain they historically haven't, so predators may be a wash.

"... So again, you have any information to support the claim that we are WORSE than other cities?  All you've provided here is evidence that the MPD is bad in this regard. You can't say ""We're so much worse than other cities"" and not provide comparative data. 

I get that the MPD has been slowing response times and ignoring certain crimes to ""teach people a lesson"" after the Defund the Police cries, but that is a trend everywhere. Nationwide the murder rate jumped almost 20% post-defund the police movement. It's not just the MPD that faced calls for defunding and ire over the George Floyd situation, it was LITERALLY a nationwide movement. 

Your wikipedia article was authored directly after the George Floyd killing, and again does not provide any comparative data to show that the MPD is worse than other cities in regards to anything related to their policing. The simple presence of a wikipedia article documenting it's issues does not prove this point because the MPD was simply the focal point of the movement due to the spark that was the murder of George Floyd. 

>Minneapolis has an objectively worse police department than almost anywhere in the country.

Objectivity requires one to control for inherent biases, without providing comparative data there is no control. 


To be clear, I am in NO WAY defending the actions of the MPD or saying they are free from any criticism. All I am saying is that nobody here has provided a single piece of data to show that the MPD is WORSE than other police departments in this regard.

"This is a symptom of cloistering and locally funded education. If Minnesota switched to a state based curricula with funding provided by state taxes and applied by student body size this would evaporate but CRT would teach you it's this way on purpose in most states to force situations like this. 

It's no accident local municple taxes funding schools leads to disparities. The rich folks in Minnetonka aren't paying for North Minneapolis students. Minnetonka schools have covered playing fields and North Mpls has broken equipment. 

We need to remove schools from this paradigm or it won't ever change. To enforce this system, you can get in legal trouble if say a North Mpls student were to get a ride to Minnetonka every day for better access to school. You literally have to move to a better district, and gentrified property prices and hostile landlords mean that doesn't happen.

">There have been movements in places like Bloomington but I can‚Äôt find anything on it, one of them I think had purple in the name? 

Well, two big positives in that area over the last few years: Old Cedar Bridge and 35W pedestrian bridge.  The flooding sucks though.  They really, really fucked up by not raising the Burnsville side of the 35W path above the flood line.

I used to bike home from Lyn-Lake to Burnsville and it required going over to Minnehaha, though Mendota, though Eagan and then Burnsville. The 35w bridge cuts almost 10 miles off the trip.

Bloomington finally un-fucked the Nicollet & 86 interchange in favor of bike safety. This is a super popular bike commuter thoroughfare so the change is really appreciated. (QBP in Bloomington is the largest bike part distributor in the US (Surly, All City, Salsa, Etc) and a LOT of their employees bike to work along 86)

This is the old layout: W 86th St

"Grew up in Rochester and now live in a small town of 2000 in Winona county.

The cities have too many one ways. It's like a god damn labyrinth built to confuddle you in the most frustrating ways.

You know you can get on the on ramp(maybe it's an exit, idk) at their Airport and end up right back at the airport without leaving that exit/on ramp monstrosity.

How anybody lives there and doesnt loose all their sanity because of those roads alone, I just dont think I will ever understand. Props to those who do but your all insane lol.

I could move back to rochester and be sane but would prefer the outskirts where I can have space (I'm becoming a bit of a hermit in my middle age lol).

Also can I say Elton Hills Drive in Rochester can go fuck itself. So hard to stay at 30mph on that road with all the ups and downs and i have to drive it every day to work lol.

"**[North Shore Highlands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore_Highlands)** 
 
 >The North Shore Highlands are a physiographic and ecological region of the U.S. state of Minnesota in central North America. They were formed by a variety of geologic processes, but are principally composed of rock created by magma and lava from a rift about 1. 1 billion years ago, which rock formations are interspersed with and overlain by glacial deposits. Their ecology derives from these origins, with thin, rocky soils supporting flora and fauna typical of their northern, inland location.

"**[Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining)** 
 
 >In the United States, redlining is a discriminatory practice in which services (financial and otherwise) are withheld from potential customers who reside in neighborhoods classified as 'hazardous' to investment; these neighborhoods have significant numbers of racial and ethnic minorities, and low-income residents. While the most well-known examples involve denial of credit and insurance, denial of healthcare and the development of food deserts in minority neighborhoods have also been attributed to redlining in many instances.

"Drivers. 

I know it's a cliche to think the other people on the road are dangerous psychopaths, but here it's literally true. 

Things I have seen since moving here one year ago:

Someone parked in the middle of an on ramp.

Someone backing up on a busy road Nevis they missed their exit. 

Someone start from a stopped position to roll through a red light while I was turning through the intersection. 

15 over the speed limit is the assumed speed. 

Blinkers mean nothing. No one cares that your blinker is on. If you use it to do what it's supposed to (indicate an upcoming lane change) people will speed up to tailgate and close off the gap. 

Driving here feels like a competitive exercise, where in other parts of the country people understand that it's supposed to be a collaborative one. 

Listen, Minnesota - I'm not trying to ""best you""... I'm trying to get safely to my destination. Stop treating every lane change as an assault on your dignity.

"I once lived in MN and now live in North Florida. Three common themes keep coming up. 

Racism. I didn't encounter much racism when I lived in MN(Twin-Cities) but it sounds like the racism now is every bit as bad as here in North Florida (Matt Gaetz's deep red congressional district).  I guess it goes to shows how endemic racism is throughout the country.

Mosquitos. Yeah, we got a bad mosquito problem here in Florida but the mosquitos in MN are huge, blood sucking vampire bat-like creatures. I have described them to Florida natives as small birds with sucking proboscises that descend in hordes so thick they block out ambient light.

Housing prices. Affordable housing is out of the reach of most people here in Florida. Ditto with rentals, if you can even find a rental in larger cities like Orlando.

"Nah.  I moved here from the DC area and I grew up between DC and NYC. 

There's sprawl to be certain, but it doesn't hold a candle to DC, NYC, or the Bay Area.

"I can‚Äôt recommend Luther Brookdale Mazda more highly. I‚Äôve had two CX-5 and they are outstanding vehicles. The service team there is exceptional and the experience was no pressure. Melissa Gurvey (sp?) was my sales rep and she was probably the best I‚Äôve ever experienced. Honest, fair, and went to bat for me on a few things. 

If you have Costco, look up Costco Auto. Back in May 2021 before the new car market went to hell, I got $4k off the CX-5 Signature without batting an eye, which according to TrueCar, was significantly lower than the market. They have partnerships with dealerships to offer prices not available to the public and it‚Äôs no hassle/no negotiation. Costco holds them to it strictly. 

I dont believe they are marking things up much, if at all- their prices are on their website. 

If you‚Äôve never driven a mazda, you should- it‚Äôs closer to luxury cars than not and for not near the same price. And they drive exceptionally well.",t2_12hbja,mno1986,0,1648858885.0,0,t1_i31vgka,i31vgka,True,goingtothemalllater,t3_tu5dtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/tu5dtj/nonmarkup_car_dealers/,non-markup car dealers,/r/minnesota/comments/tu5dtj/nonmarkup_car_dealers/i31vgka/,5,r/minnesota,0,5
Agree with bixmen. Last time I flew in was gonna get an Uber but then I saw all the cabs just sitting across the way. Was in a cab heading out super fast and I am sure it was right around the same price as an Uber.,t2_frh0snpf,Retrorpg87,0,1648858785.0,0,t1_i31v98d,i31v98d,True,zynfan,t3_ttz44b,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/ttz44b/what_is_the_best_way_to_get_from_the_airport/,What is the best way to get from the airport?,/r/minnesota/comments/ttz44b/what_is_the_best_way_to_get_from_the_airport/i31v98d/,2,r/minnesota,0,2
