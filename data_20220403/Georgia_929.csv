"It is a crime for someone to threaten or harm you with a firearm. If they do any of those things, that is where the line is drawn. If someone is not breaking the law, their business is simply their business and nobody else's. We have the highest amount of firearm deaths (primarily suicides) because we have the largest amount of firearms. Other nations with less firearms have similar suicide rates just with different methods. America is a heterogenous society in terms of cultures, race, class, religion, etc. These differences can lead to inequalities, marginalization, and sometimes violence in certain communities (these differences are also largely what makes America so strong and enduring as they mostly present positively in society but there's always a downside to something) and in certain communities in our country gun violence can be a problem at times. But looking at the actual statistics of gun violence deaths, they are most often perpetrated by people who are not licensed to carry (in states with licenses), and the quantity of those violent acts tend to be significantly less than drunk driving incidents, which is a much more real and prevalent danger. The hypothetical unease and concern you mentioned feeling about being at the grocery store and not knowing who may be carrying a gun irresponsibly, this is a fear I feel while out on the road not knowing who is impaired or texting instead of keeping their focus on piloting their 3000 pound metal death machine on wheels. Ultimately, in life we have to respect the freedom of others and trust they'll do the right thing but be cautious in case they won't. Drunk driving is illegal. Harming someone with a gun in a situation where it isn't justifiable is illegal. My entire movie and TV collection on my basement pc is pirated and therefore illegal lol. There will always be people who do illegal things. Thankfully most of the bad crimes tend to be rather rare and spark great outrage when they do occur. There is no constitutional right to not be afraid. It's something that can't be legislated because some people aren't scared of anything, some are scared of guns, others heights or butterflies (guilty). As for gun ownership being restricted, in some states it is insanely restrictive relative to the majority of states. California, Hawaii, and New York have laws that basically guarantee only the rich and powerful will have easy access to most firearms. Last I checked Hawaii only granted six carry permits since 1996 (this number may be out of date though). As for whether licensing or training violates the second amendment, I'm not certain it has been ruled either way as of yet and I'm interested in what clarification would come should it be out before the supreme court, but I view it as similar to voter ID laws and the immense censorship the FCC and certain other government bodies (federal, state, and local) sometimes impose on citizens. Things that haven't been properly challenged that clearly infringe on our rights but haven't been properly challenged or previous rulings have been questionable at best.

"I appreciate your consistency.  

I guess when I see US gun ownership being the highest in the world, by far, and the deaths by firearms leading worldwide, again by a large measure, I really don't see gun ownership, realistically, being restricted in any meaningful way.  I also don't believe (although I'm not a constitutional scholar) requirements for training and licensing are a violation of the 2nd amendment, at least it's never been ruled that it is.  

The question in my mind is under what circumstances does a person's right to conceal carry cross over into my right to life and safety.  For example, I'm standing in line at a grocery store with my kid. The person next to me has a handgun concealed under their coat.  I have no idea if that person is a responsible gun owner and assuming he or she is not, they are, in fact, a threat to me and my kid.  

So where are my rights in those circumstances?  Surely, the gun owner isn't the only person who has any rights, correct?

"The line I draw is when it is a constitutional right. I do not believe in requiring licenses or tests that could get in the way of someone voting, exercising freedom of speech, exercising their 2nd amendment rights, etc. Additionally, I believe our drivers license testing is a complete joke and may as well not exist (at least in Georgia). I'll also add that it is not okay that the DMV is only open during weekday work hours requiring people take time off of work to utilize their incredibly vital services. Could easily be fixed by adding weekend hours. I know it seems like I'm going on a tangent, but my point is that when the government gets in the way of the lives of citizens by putting up rather arbitrary obstacles or major inconveniences, something isn't working how it should. How many states handle CCW permit training and competency testing is imperfect and presents a barrier to entry that disincentivizes primarily poor working class people from exercising the same rights as those with more time and money on their hands.

"I do believe that he thinks he‚Äôs doing the right thing.  However, the reality is this: Black people understand that the US is a very racist, albeit wealthy country.  The vast majority of black people would never align themselves with white southern Christian values ( babies, guns & Jesus to put it simply) because they understand that those ‚Äúvalues‚Äù hurt them.  

However, Herschel has been able to navigate outside of those values and insulate himself because of his wealth.  So, for him, aligning himself with white people whose values hurt blacks but don‚Äôt hurt the wealthy makes sense.  

What‚Äôs hilarious is that Herschel‚Äôs son is a flaming gay man who is also conservative.  So, from that standpoint, I admire how ‚Äúflexible‚Äù these southern conservative values become when they can find the unicorn ü¶Ñ: A rich black man who doesn‚Äôt have any interest is fighting for civil rights.

Finally, White people understand that the country is becoming more diverse and that their political views are unpopular amongst the majority of Americans, so they‚Äôre thrilled to find this unicorn.

"I‚Äôm an alumnus of UGA as well. Herschel grew up in Wrightsville, GA during the early 1960s, also known as the civil rights era. A town that, to this day, boasts a population of less than 4,000 people and can be found on a map by its proximity to the state prison. He had a bad stuttering issue, and could very well have had other learning disabilities because IDEA wasn‚Äôt a thing at the time. 

What‚Äôs shocking to me is how many of you tolerant Democrats would disparage a  man who grew up in a time and place where you wouldn‚Äôt find the best educational resources afforded to an African American child from limited means in Podunk, Georgia. He didn‚Äôt graduate because he decided to go pro, as many other football players have done and continue to do. I believe he was later awarded an honorary degree from the University. He probably did struggle with reading, but I‚Äôm betting if he were running as a Democrat you‚Äôd be celebrating how he overcame his difficulties and went on to become a huge success.

My child even was like wtf. Recently Brainpop was banned because it had a diversity section. A digital repository of educational videos that was used optionally was banned because it had some videos about Juneteenth and oppression. Of course this same school posted a photo of 100+ kids praying in the shape of a cross last week (technically posted by a teacher not the school officially). While technically legal given it was before school, optional and whatever, it shows what is running the schools at this point in the  rural and suburbs. 

During discussions around native americans they didn't even discuss New Echota which is right here in our own state. They sure as shit didn't mention the fort IN OUR OWN FUCKING COUNTY where they rounded up the Cherokee to march off. That just hits too close to home I guess.

"An ""argument"" entails the other party has a point. You mentioned the tenth amendment as though it had any bearing on the proscribed ""God Given"" rights, such as the five from the first amendment, the right to keep and bear arms from the second (as well as a militia, mentioned numerous times in the bible); quartering troops in a house you actually aren't given the right to own, from a federal standpoint, in the third; the right to unlawful search or siezure of property you don't have the right to possess as well as your house you don't have a right to own (again, not listed as a ""right""); the right to not incriminate yourself... As God intended; the right to a speedy trial by the state and the right to a jury trial against other citizens; the right to maybe not be beaten in jail (8th) but still be a slave (13th); the right to ""personal liberties""; and the right of other entities to create more restrictions on your rights.

The only place you're given the right to possess something is the 2nd. 

So your comment about the tenth amendment has nothing to do with property rights, other than telling other entities how to define them. I mean, the Constitution of Georgia, article 1, section 3 literally deals with how the government can take your property. 

Dropping ""the tenth"" without your context about how it refutes my point (which it doesn't) is an argument in bad faith. I've laid out the paraphrased statement about how you're actually not allowed a lot of ""God Given"" rights, nor much in the way of property rights.

You're allowed to carry any type of rifle/long gun without any permit in GA. I've lived here my whole life, I never had to get a license or register a gun if it wasn't a newly purchased pistol.

You're also legally allowed to possess a weapon in your home, vehicle or place of business (sans permit).

"I'm other words, they spoke for God.

But it's interesting that the bill of rights specifically lays out bearing arms but not property rights (despite what disciples of John Locke seem to think). It doesn't say anything about marriage or bearing children. It doesn't say anything about education or art. 

So because none of these things are rights via the Constitution, did God not consider them rights? Maybe marriage and art are covered by the first amendment, but not the legal versions of either.

"I think any time a concealed carry permit requires training, this presents a few issues. The classes often cost money, which is not cool imo as it gatekeeps exercising constitutional rights behind a money wall. They also require an opening in one's schedule, which is another thing that can very much affect those with lower income who tend to have less free time for appointments and whatnot. So it wouldn't be my preference. If the government had stringent standards and hired competent people to be trainers and made it free and had incredibly flexible scheduling, I could consider it more viable an option.

"Well, if you were ""management"" (which it seems you want to be when you grow up) you'd understand that you're fundamentally useless. ""Management"" performs no useful purpose. 

Ultimately it doesn't matter how much BS you ejaculate syphilitically into the aether, you're insignificant to the economy. What we're involved in chews lives up without the slightest issue. That's why you like expensive drugs... Particularly for others, because you're brainwashed into thinking ""status"" or ""management"" matters. They don't.

I always like comparing it to Cannae. The Carthaginians would have won whether there were ten more hastati or ten more proletarii. Middle class or poor, if you're on the lines you're going to die. Nobody will remember your name in 200 years. Everything you worked for will be gone. Your government, lifestyle, the way you measure success will either vanish or evolve.

All you can do, now, is try to make the world a better place and enjoy it. People won't give two shits about your ""management skills"" the second you die, but if you change someone's life for the better, you might have done something worthwhile. Too many people have this huge lust for fucking people over (your ideology) because they're angry at ____. What it is doesn't matter. All your bullshit excuses for having a garbage thought is just that, bullshit. 

How about price fixing a drug for diabetics, for example? Your ideology presumes that if insulin is price fixed, demand will change along with availability, creating a scarcity. Tell me, how many people are going out shopping for diabetes? How many people are out there actively trying to catch it? Even if this is a slippery slope to other drugs being fixed, why... Just why... Would people purposely catch a deadly disease? 

So, when you get a little older (high school or so) try to understand that the world doesn't give a shit if you want people to die, because it's not about you. It's not even about your legacy or your manifesto. It's if you left the campground better than you arrived.

"They are literally still paying taxes. Their taxes go to fund services, including services they don't use. Just because they also use services doesn't mean they don't pay taxes.

If half the country stopped paying taxes, there'd be a mass collapse of government functions, because that funding is necessary.

Also, holy shit. I grew up poor due to familial medical debt. I went through public school, I was fed through free-lunch programs, I was able to partake in extracurriculars because they got funding though the district and state and feds, I was on state health insurance, we were getting early social security checks above what had been paid by my parents.

And guess what? I was able to get into a good college (which I worked, and got federal grants, and federally-subsidized loans during), and am now earning significant amounts of money for my age, paying back into the system that helped me get here. I am in no way the only one who was helped in these ways from my HS, and many folks were able to go on to better places because of that help.

We are proof positive that social investment in the poor works. On the larger scale, we have plenty of analysis that social support generates net positive economic activity. We are not animals. We are people.

I've got six degrees, three hard science, one engineering.

I left the military as an E-5, FC2.

I earned a journeyman millwright card in the UAW and the IAMAW. 

And I did all that by the time I was 30, partially because the military made me work for an education, the union forced me to work, not only for the card but for the >1,000 hours of classroom training. They're the ones that made me work towards the degrees.

"So, you're an older guy, you seem to know things... Anecdotally.

Back in April '19 my wife and I go to Scotland. On the flight over the recirculated air coupled with other factors gives me a sinus infection.

Well, I don't want to have a shit time in Edinburgh, you know? Sniffling and carrying around Kleenex.

We go into a Boots store and I'm looking for some sinus stuff... Any sinus stuff. Finally I ask if they have any. The nice young lady points out this stuff but says, ""why don't you just head to the clinic? It's just over there.""

I'm wondering if my insurance will cover Scotland, because I have extraordinary insurance I hoped.

We head to the clinic. There's nobody there other than a young lady behind a window. I ask if I can see someone about this thing. She writes it down and asks me to see my passport.

I'm wondering where the other patients are when a guy walks out, asks me what's up, looks up my schnoz and says I do have a mild infection and says he'll prescribe me something, I ask if he wants to see me back, he says only if it's not better.

I go into this aisleway out by another window and a young man. He hands me a bag with two pill bottles. I ask who I'm supposed to pay. He looks at me weird and said ""pay what?""

For the doctor or the meds I reply. He just laughs, ""this isn't America.""

So, they didn't charge anything. Price was fixed. There wasn't any shortage of service. The service was arguably superior to the US, as there wasn't all the fluff they normally add for no good reason, just a guy addressing your issue. They make it approachable so you're not mis medicating yourself with OTC stuff. Note that I was in one of the largest cities in Scotland, in one of the most populated areas.

It's hard to evolve when you get older. I'm 50 this year and find myself fighting change left and right. I don't like getting older. I don't like needing bifocals. I don't like feeling things ache in the morning just because the weather's changing.

But I do believe in making the world a better place than how I got it. If it means I have to wear bifocals to see a better world, I'll have to do it. If it causes aches to make it better for kids I'll never have, I'll do it. 

The question is, do you want a better world? One where you have to pay more in taxes but don't have to pay for health insurance and people don't file bankruptcy for medical treatment? Wouldn't that be a whole lot better than making health insurance another cross to bear? Just like housing, cars, student loans?

"History doesn‚Äôt prove your point, and in this instance specifically the price being charged for said item is 100x higher than its cost to produce. And since the item is made in huge quantities worldwide the issues you might normally see with price ceilings almost certainly won‚Äôt apply here. In this case the market can‚Äôt work as intended because gov regulations prevent people from being able to seek out a cheaper price and corporations have no incentive to lower the price since they have a strangle hold on the supply and the item is a necessity. 

A few minutes of cortical thinking would illustrate why fixing the price ceiling of insulin won‚Äôt have any negative effects, other than some reduced profit for a handful of corporations.

It's only the US that has the savagery of going bankrupt and losing everything you ever built because you got sick.  This study by Kaiser provides a little background.

[https://medalerthelp.org/blog/medical-bankruptcies/](https://medalerthelp.org/blog/medical-bankruptcies/)

""The Kaiser Family Foundation (2015) stated that 26% of Americans aged 18‚Äì64, or about 52 million adults, struggled to pay for healthcare costs. The survey estimated that 2% of them, or one million people, declared bankruptcy because of medical bills that year"".

""the disturbing fact is that the average 65-year-old couple will face medical bills of about a quarter-million dollars during retirement, even with support from the national health insurance program of the US, Medicare""

But hey, I am sure multinational corporations are glad you are a ""fuck it, if I get sick I will just bankrupt my family and destroy their lives"" kind of guy.  I am sure that will work out for you and your loved ones.

Political ideology ‚Äî Presidents usually appoint judges who seem to have a similar political ideology to their own. In other words, a president with a liberal ideology will usually appoint liberals to the courts. Likewise, conservative presidents tend to appoint conservatives.

&#x200B;

Party and personal loyalties ‚Äî A remarkably high percentage of a resident's appointees belong to the president's political party. Although political favoritism is less common today than it was a few decades ago, presidents still appoint friends and loyal supporters to federal judgeships.

""Separately, the Trump administration implemented a program in which some Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans voluntarily set the maximum copay for insulin at $35 per month. However, not all insulin products are necessarily covered by the plans that participate. It also does not affect costs for people who are uninsured or have other coverage.  
That program remains in place, and Cubanski pointed out that the Biden administration supported expanding that initiative.
