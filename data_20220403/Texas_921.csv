This is true for Texas in general, but the Big Bend area and surroundings are sparsely populated. Keep gas in your car. Keep water in your trunk. Keep your passport handy because there are immigration checks going into/out of the park. We stayed outside the park but had to drive at least an hour to make it to the visitor's centre.

"You can definitely stay in Terlingua and make the drive in to see the park. Honestly, I’d recommend that for you if you don’t have gear with you. You can stay in a lodge inside the park, but they book up quickly. And I actually prefer to stay in Terlingua if I’m not remote camping. There’s some cool things to see around the town and I highly recommend you eat at the Starlight Cafe. Good food and a great environment with live music on weekends. Nearby is Milagros for coffee and brunch. For accommodations, check air bnb, agoda, or just Google around a bit. There’s not any name brand hotels. Small lodges and guest houses. Even some boutique air streams are available. 

There’s plenty of hikes available even if not camping. It’s about a 30-40 min drive into to National park from Terlingua. I recommend getting up early. Before sunrise preferably. The drive into the park as the sun is coming up is gorgeous. The two best hikes from the base of the HQ/lodge is Emory peak and/or the South Rim. 

I want to say Emory peak is about 4-5 miles to the summit. It’s the highest point in the park and views are really great. From here you can go back the way you came, or continue on for the South Rim hike. It’s a loop and will take you back to HQ where you parked. It’s a long hike- I want to say about 15ish miles, but honestly i thought was amazing. I’ve been to Patagonia and although different, it’s absolutely stunning in its own way. On the south rim you can look across the rio grande into Mexico. It’s expanse is massive and other worldly looking. It’s a great hike if you’re up to it and have plenty of water. Definitely double in one day if you hit the road early. 

Alternatively there are plenty of shorter hikes and look outs with great views and some don’t even require hiking. 

Overall, I highly recommend Big Bend. Marfa is cool too. Anywhere in the hill country. You can float several rivers although it would be pretty cold in April. Guadalupe peak is a cool hike. Tallest mountain in Texas and has some cool Native American history associated. It is VERY remote. It’s also not too far from Carlsbad caverns in New Mexico which is a big cave system with tours. There’s really not a shortage- just depends on timing and what you want to see.

"Yes, reserve an Airbnb or rooms in Terlingua and eat at the Starlight Theater. Do hikes in the park. The “windows trail” is beautiful and the Santa Elena canyon is spectacular. 

Bring passports with you when you visit Boquillas canyon and take the rowboat to Boquillas del Carmen, a tiny Mexican village, for lunch. Eat enchiladas verdes at José Falcone’s restaurant and drink a $1 beer (Victoria is good one). Sit outside with views of the Rio Grande. A pickup truck takes you up the hill from the river to the village and back. Take the Row boat back (tip the guy doing the rowing!) and you will re-enter the US by checking in at a unmanned passport station where you lay your passport face down on a screen. 

It is very simple and quick. Yes, you can cross the US Mexican border in a rowboat. 

If you want to splurge a little, spend a night or two at the Gage hotel in Marathon Texas. It has a delightful bar and a nice restaurant. Visit trendy and arty Marfa Texas. Go for a hike in the Davis Mountains and visit the McDonald’s observatory just outside of Fort Davis Texas. There’s small motels or hotels in all of these little towns. 

If it is possible to get reservations, look on the McDonald’s observatory website and reserve seats at a “star party,” an outdoor astronomy lecture given by astronomers from University Of Texas using a laser light pointer and telling you about things in the amazingly dark sky. It is a fascinating experience.

And, I tell all of my European friends this: service workers in America live on tips. They usually make less than minimum wage, which is $7.75 an hour. (Republicans always veto or filibuster increases). Just because you do not like our system, please do not punish our servers. It’s not their fault. Tip your waiter, tip your waitress, tip your bartender. They depend on it. 

There’s a bar in Austin that attracts a lot of visitors from UK. They have a sign by the cash register that says “welcome to our friends from the UK, but keep in mind that *cheers* is not a tip!”",t2_4fhr3vxu,livemusicisbest,0,1649005831.0,0,t1_i38sohy,i38sohy,True,al-vo,t3_tvbka7,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/tvbka7/big_bend_vs_alternatives_for_foreign_tourists/,Big Bend vs. alternatives for foreign tourists,/r/texas/comments/tvbka7/big_bend_vs_alternatives_for_foreign_tourists/i38sohy/,4,r/texas,0,4

"I recently did a trip to Big Bend that involved staying in Alpine, Texas. This allowed us to stay in a chain Hilton hotel using points. We had to get up at 4:30am hit the road by 5:00am to make 7:00am at the park. We were able to complete the Emory Peak via South Rim Trail and Boot Springs Trail (\~15.2 miles) before heading back. It's an all day event when you add the 2 hour drive back to the hotel. It's doable, but you will be exhausted. So plan for perhaps an easier day the following day.

My opinion is the views Big Bend offer is worth the sacrifice in time to see. However, if you're looking more for exploring cities and what they have to offer I'd say skip it. 

One last tip is to remember to bring your passport if you go. Big Bend requires going through a border checkpoint just before Alpine.

"Look at places in Alpine or the Gage hotel in Marathon for the shortest drives to the park entrance. You can also stay in places like Terlingua but Alpine will offer more conveniences you may need. Further away, also look into Fort Davis Mountains campground if you want camp or Marfa (camping/hotels/Airbnb).  


Do keep in mind getting to Big Bend is going to be a time suck. It's gorgeous but the nearest major city is El Paso. The drive from the El Paso airport is about 5 1/2 hours assuming you don't stop. Austin is about an 8 hour drive. San Antonio is about the same. Even with 85 mph speed limits (\`137 kmh) - and most people speed - it's going to take time to get there and traverse the park by car.

This is the remote desert so it’s going to not be anything fancy (and probably kinda rough tbh) but that’s what life is like in the high desert.

I have done stuff with several outfitters over the years and can make some recommendations. Your best bet though is to stay in or around Terlingua. Alpine is an hour away and def not preferred if you are looking to maximize time around the park.

"What you are describing is how poker works in any poker room in the country. The house takes a set amount, called the rake or drop, and then determines the winner. I don't see how your solution is any different.

BTW, Texas has one of the fastest growing poker scenes in the country. They exist in a grey area of the law currently. Dallas just tried to get them banned and the poker rooms won their case. The current situation as I understand it is that the poker rooms exist as private membership clubs. They charge a monthly membership fee as well as an hourly charge to sit and play at the cash game tables. Tournaments just charge a single set fee. These clubs however are not allowed to have liquor licences but are allowed to BYOB so there is that. Also some of the clubs have a restriction on who they allow to be members, they require a US driver's license or government issued photo ID so people from outside the US cannot play. The ironic thing about this is that the goal isn't to keep out Mexicans, but to keep European pros from coming over and making the games tougher. Some clubs even limit it to North American ID rather than US ID.",t2_7yvy3ct,JasperStrat,0,1648982991.0,0,t1_i37kbt4,i37kbt4,True,FriscoTXMan,t3_tuxzxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/tuxzxj/would_paramutual_poker_be_legal_in_texas/,Would “paramutual poker” be legal in Texas?,/r/texas/comments/tuxzxj/would_paramutual_poker_be_legal_in_texas/i37kbt4/,1,r/texas,0,1

">AISDs problem is that they are losing students. We are down 12K students in 10 years. That is equivalent to 120 million of funding that was lost. AISD is very poorly run and it isnt a matter of money.

AISD's problem is money period.  Last school year AISD collected about $20,895 per student in funding.  

Of that, the got to keep $9,444 from property taxes.  They received $616 from the state.  They received $438 from the federal government.  There is a line item listed for $229 as other local funds.  This comes out to a total of $10,727.  There is no other COL adjustments.  This is what AISD gets to keep.

AISD gets to keep an additional $2,054 from debt service and maintenance and operations bring the grand total of what AISD keeps per student to $12,782.

AISD will send back $8,114 to the state; these are local property taxes that if the state of Texas wasn't bleeding AISD for AISD would be so flush with cash it would be abso-fucking-lutely insane.

AISD will spend per student $11,944.  Or about $1,217 more than it gets to keep.  Debt service and other non operating expenditures will push total expenditures per student up by $2,074 per student for a grand total of $14,018.

The state says AISD gets to spend $12,782 to educate a student and AISD is going spend $14,018 per student.  AISD has been able to spend cash reserves it has built up over the last decade to overcome the deficit but they are rapidly bleeding through those cash reserves and are reaching a point where they aren't going to be able to deficit spend to make up for the money Texas bleeds out of the district.

The TL;DR AISD collects more than enough money to fund itself, the state helps itself to a good chunk of that money leaving AISD with a deficit it has been making up from savings but those savings are rapidly running out .... oh and last budget cycle the state took 1.4 billion collected as recapture and repurposed it for other state budget items.",t2_izipc,rk57957,0,1648959406.0,0,t1_i36ox89,i36ox89,False,Realistic_Winter5754,t3_tt4wf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/tt4wf1/robin_hood_funding_for_school_districts/,Robin Hood funding for school districts,/r/texas/comments/tt4wf1/robin_hood_funding_for_school_districts/i36ox89/,1,r/texas,0,1

Edit since you edited: yes, there should be a separation of church and state.  No one said there shouldn't be.

Abortion is murder and shouldn't be a right.

Conservatives want to expand rights: expand the right of people to keep their money, expand the right of people to defend themselves, expand the right of people to have God (or not) in their lives, expand the right of a parent to teach their children as they see fit, and expand the right of people to live their lives as they see fit with minimal government interference.  As long as someone isn't mentally unwell, people should have complete and utter control over their lives.

"I don't know, I've lived in abilene since 97 and it's too Christian (thanks to ACU paying the city of abilene) to become that big. Plus I doubt we'd have the resources to support over 250k people without doing a massive fix to the infrastructure and build high-rise apartments or the west Texas equivalent to them because we won't reach that rate by expanding out in houses in the country where most people here can't afford them. The biggest thing abilene has going for it now, building construction wise, is a double tree inn in downtown but it's not an apartment style place and while it may have resident rooms, there won't be many.

Edit: as far as 'too Christian', I don't mean that as a bad thing but it is considering the businesses that are willing to come here with our city laws and the Christian influence in town. We have a church for basically every 800 people of our 120k population. We have a hooters in town but it doesn't do well and if you're an acu student and get caught going to hooters you'll get suspended. It's stupid but true.

"It's certainly callous.  It's probably hurtful.  Then again, if you don't want people on the internet to be awful to you about your deceased animals, don't let on that you have had any.  But it might be helpful.  Climate change is happening to us.  As a comparison, imagine that we live in an area that was only very rarely given to earthquakes.  We didn't build our buildings and bridges specifically to withstand regular earthquakes, because that would be a needless expense in most cases, most of the time.  But now we are getting earthquakes often enough that we need to make expensive changes.  It might be helpful to point out specific buildings or bridges in specific areas that have failed, so that they can be redesigned and rebuilt stronger.  It's not the victims' fault(pun) that they weren't prepared the first time.  But we need to get busy frost-proofing our buildings and infrastructure last year.  It's only a matter of time before it happens again.


It's interesting to note the difference in value systems between you and the previous commenter.  You value helpfulness and lack of hurtfulness over a raw truth value.  The previous commenter has an opposite arrangement of priorities, such that a statement's factual truth value could be enough to justify any hurtfulness.",t2_ifahrjdp,ThaMadHater,0,1648938253.0,0,t1_i35q4j7,i35q4j7,False,SubzeroNYC,t3_tuol0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/tuol0r/marijuana_legalization_is_going_to_the_senate/,Marijuana legalization is going to the Senate - Here's how you can contact Cruz and Cornyn,/r/texas/comments/tuol0r/marijuana_legalization_is_going_to_the_senate/i35q4j7/,-1,r/texas,0,-1
