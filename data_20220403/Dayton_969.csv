"""Idle properties are owned properties"".  This is stupid and says nothing. As for idle properties, they would need to be bought/donated.  I don't think this takes much brain power.  Big metal and concrete thing in a swiftly moving river costs a lot of money to maintain.  The more of these big concrete things we have, the worse it is for the environment.  

""This bridge is pedestrian only, and links parks together.""  This is a fact, but this is not a business case.  Is there a driving need to connect these parks or would we drive more pedestrian traffic by making two of the 4 bridges within a quarter mile more pedestrian friendly?  

""We don't need to share a pedestrian bridge with jalopy cars.""  Again, you're barely coherent.  So we should just tear up every sidewalk because this is too much like sharing with an evil, mean car?

"""Garden Station was a community garden, urban farm, art park and sustainable living education center in downtown Dayton created by over 3000 volunteers and over 300 organizations and donations from the community. It was possibly the largest and most diverse all-volunteer community project in the history of Dayton. We taught over 60 free classes each year to over 1000 attendees on a wide variety of sustainable living topics. Over 500 students and organizations took educational tours of Garden Station every year. We grew produce in permanent, no-till raised beds to preserve healthy soil structure. Everything was grown organically without chemical pesticides or herbicides. We built healthy soil by adding compost and aerobic compost tea and used crop rotation and companion planting to help prevent disease and pests. Permaculture principals of earthworks water harvesting and permanent ground covers were incorporated in our market crops and we had a food forest of medicinal and edible herbs, berries, nuts and fruit; as well as examples of sustainable building techniques including straw bale, pounded tire, green roof and bottle walls.  We received national recognition and may have been the most ""liked"" community garden on facebook. Many communities sent representatives to tour and model something like Garden Station in their own community. Our EarthFest became the largest Earth Day event in southwest Ohio with as many as 5000 attendees. 

Despite all our acclaim the Dayton City Commissioners, Mayor and City Manager evicted Garden Station October 31, 2016 to make way for potential unnamed commercial development.  The land was given to an out of state developer for ten dollars, even though over 4000 residents signed a petition to keep Garden Station for the community and over a hundred residents attended city commission meetings to protest. None of the City Commissioners or Mayor even responded to our offer to a guided tour of the space to understand what the community was protesting losing.

"Just because I already did the work on this one and posted this reply on r/Ohio …

According to MVRPC, 2400 people travelled across the Monument Ave bridge in 2017, the most recent year a count was taken. To compare, 14100 people travelled across the First street bridge per day in 2019, 11500 people travelled across the third street bridge per day in 2019, 3700 travelled across the Germantown/Fifth street bridge per day and 5900 travelled across the Washington Street bridge per day. For comparison, 19000 people travelled across the Min street bridge per day in 2016, the most recent year a count was taken. So the First street bridge can easily take on the Monument Street traffic and not even match the amount of traffic crossing at Main, the busiest non-interstate bridge downtown…. I’m saying that with confidence because the First street bridge is actually wider than the Main Street bridge and would still handle less traffic. And the Main Street bridge was just rebuilt for its current traffic load within the past 5-10 years.

"$40,000,000 is… not that much money. I know it seems like a lot, but $40m divided by the 537,000 county residents is less than $75 a person for a bridge that would be expected to last for at least 50 years. And as the article states, they haven’t even allocated anything and I doubt the county and parks district would even directly pay more than 50% of the cost, which would bring the direct tax bill down to like $40 a person in Montgomery County. $40m isn’t going to solve hunger in the Miami valley, or stop the opioid crisis, but having an attractive central city does encourage people to move into the area, which raises the median income and ultimately increases the tax base so that we can actually afford lasting solutions to some of our ongoing problems. When I spend my tax money, I want it to be used as a foundation for something that’s going to encourage more investment and bring in more money to the region long-term. Is a landmark bridge (that hasn’t even been RFP’d yet) going to do that?

"Yeah! We do this every year in Jan / Feb. So look for signups in Oct / Nov. see info here: [https://www.daytonbattleofthebands.com/](https://www.daytonbattleofthebands.com/)

Each week of the playoffs are different genres - so there is a hip-hop week,  a punk / rock week, a country/bluegrass week, etc. That way the finale is diverse :) Four bands compete during each round - but compete is wrong word. Very friendly, networking. It's not much of a ""battle"" in that sense. Each act performs for 20 min.

If you win the playoff round - you get to perform at Levitt Pavilion opening for a national act and you get a professional live video. If you win the whole thing -  you also get an EP recording session and cash prize.

"I would not pull a permit for this, but you are supposed to.  If you do, you'll have to have your parents pull it.  If you say it's not your house they'll likely turn you away.  The process doesn't take long, you fill out the permit, pay the fee ($60), do the work, then call for inspection.    Then you fix whatever the inspector tells you to fix and call him back again when you are done.  As a homeowner, just expect this.

“Marion's ice cream and burger shop on N Main St in Riverdale... Marion Glass opened the shop in the mid-thirties. The business eventually expanded to become Marion's Pizza and the burger store remained open for a long time. The pizza business is still family owned. The Glass family lived in our Oakwood neighborhood. Marion frequented the Patterson and Shroyer store until his death in the early 2000's. He was quite elderly and was famous for causing total chaos whenever he was in a store by over-riding the store manager at every turn, i.e. hey you - quit making pizzas and take the trash out! On the other hand, he was a great ambassador among the customers.”

This was the first Marion’s location. The chain only came about after the Glass Family fell out with Vic Cassano—closed their franchise location, and opened their own chain.

"PAY CLOSE ATTENTION PEOPLE: The police and city government are placing a “Minimum” time frame on storing the data but no “maximum” time on storing your personal data. 

HERE IS THE TRUTH: it’s like the ole bait and switch or the “GOVERNMENTS” way of getting citizens to plea. Once the Government gets you in a tight spot, the prosecuting attorneys pressure citizens into “Plea Deals” by scaring them with ridiculously long prison terms or absurd fine amounts. 

HERE IS HOW IT WORKS: The local government baits its citizens into arguing about the “Maximum” and “Minimum” length they store data while they track our daily lives (where the overwhelming majority are law abiding citizens). 

So, instead of HEARING US, LISTENING TO US & the understanding that we DO NOT want cameras tracking our daily lives, they bait us into arguing about “time the data can be stored.” Once they have the citizens arguing about the “length they can store your personal data,” they switch the public into thinking or believing the argument is the length of time they can store personal data on law abiding citizens and then publish headlines something like this: “Local citizens speak out and overwhelmingly AGREE that the City of Dayton should only store personal data for 180 days.” 

SEE WHAT HAPPENED THERE: The local Government knows that 95% or more citizens driving past the cameras everyday are law abiding citizens going about personal business (Work, School, Grocery, Etc..). They also know that 95% or more citizens do NOT WANT CAMERAS AT ALL tracking their daily routines. So, they publish a minor detail that will cause division (how long our personal data should be stored and possibly used against us) while ignoring the fact that 95% of local citizens DO NOT want cameras at all tracking our daily lives and routines. Then they have their spokesperson douse the media with headlines that read like this, “Local citizens speak out and overwhelmingly AGREE that the City of Dayton should only store personal data for 180 days” when the headlines should read like this, “An overwhelming majority of Daytonians agree that NO CAMERAS should be installed that track the lives and daily routines of law abiding citizens.”",t2_afaqhsn0,WhiteHat_Hack,0,1648647796.0,0,t1_i2pplfu,i2pplfu,True,Pariahdog119,t3_tr4hmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dayton/comments/tr4hmp/data_stored_for_a_minimum_of_30_days_with_no/,"Data stored for a minimum of 30 days, with no maximium.

    I don't know if they do have any that specializes in curly hair, but I don't believe they would try and pass you off to anyone that wasn't ( in other words I feel like they are on the up and up.) And if you gave them a call and tell them what you are looking for they will definitely get you set up if they have a stilyst like that. And if they don't at the location you call, they will direct you to one that does.
  Of course it's a really good salon and spa with awesome Aveda products. So they have higher priced services. But you really do get what you pay for.

"> A detailed account of a person's movements, drawn from electronic surveillance, encroaches upon a person's reasonable expectation of privacy because the whole reveals far more than the sum of the parts. The difference is not one of degree but of kind.  Prolonged surveillance reveals types of information not revealed by short-term surveillance, such as what a person does repeatedly, what he does not do, and what he does ensemble. Aggregated location data reveals a highly detailed profile, not simply of where we go, but by easy inference, of our associations -- political, religious, amicable and amorous, to name only a few -- and of the pattern of our professional and avocational pursuits.

"it ends up being a difference between data collected by marketers and data collected by people who are searching for people to arrest.    it would be nice to say that across the entire country there would never be an instance where data collected for the purpose of law enforcement was misused, but.

If you want to really scare yourself, consider someone selling an AI solution that purports to take this data, join it with data on traffic tickets and outstanding warrants, create a model and then predict whether you're secretly a criminal based on how you drive and what your car looks like.    I'd bet a quarter someone's working on that right now.  Especially considering some of the features they're including in their data set, like time spent idling.

"As a mobile app developer what do you think of law enforcement's use of mobile location data?   I've personally got mixed feelings (as I expect nearly everyone does if they think about it):  I'm unhappy it was used at BLM protests, I'm happy it was used to arrest people on January 6th.  

That said, any tool used by law enforcement should have appropriate restrictions and civil rights protections built in.   So the question is whether recent leaps in technology are maintaining the previous civil rights protections (like warrants for entering houses or wiretapping), or if those protections are being left behind.

Presumably if mobile location data is being used for retroactive crowd tracking/investigation, license plate data will eventually be used in basically the same way.

"I’m gonna be honest- this is a bad faith statement. You’re comparing kiwis to kale. Corporations are not beholden to the citizenry.  And we can talk at great lengths about the very real issues with corporate data control (and I’m sure we’d have PLENTY to agree on!), but this isn’t Amazon. 

While I don’t have anything to hide and can easily answer why I’m at a particular location at the same time five days a week, why should I have to?  For me, the red glaring flag is that this is also storing information related to suspected activity.  In a police state, everything and anything private citizens do can be suspicious.  

I live in a neighborhood that is “sketchy” to be honest and polite, and I’d rather not have to worry about my neighbors (predominately POC) and I being surveilled for just living on the “wrong” side of town. Which ultimately this is going to be used for. Because iirc, none of this is going up in Oakwood or Centerville — but also correct me if im wrong.

It's another thing entirely to hoover up data about countless ordinary citizens going about their daily business, and then keep it indefinitely. The use of license-plate readers during an immediate threat to public safety is acceptable, Cuccinelli said, but their passive use during routine patrols is not, and neither is the practice of storing data from them. The need for collecting the information should be established before they are used, he wrote.

>Some police departments took heed of Cuccinelli's opinion. Others ignored the AG's advice completely. Fairfax was one of them. Harrison Neal, a resident whose license plate showed up in the county's database, challenged the county's policy on privacy grounds. Last month Fairfax Circuit Court judge Robert Smith issued a summary judgment in the county's favor. The Virginia Supreme Court will soon decide whether to review the matter. It certainly should.

S>mith's reasoning is straightforward: License plates are not personal information. Plate numbers are not listed among other forms of personal data in the state's Government Data Collection and Dissemination Act. What's more, while other forms of information listed in the act—such as Social Security numbers—refer back to an individual, ""a license plate number leads directly to a motor vehicle and nothing more."" Other government data can tell you who owns the vehicle, but ""a license plate does not tell the researcher where the person is, what the person is doing, or anything else about the person.""

>Well now. If that is true, then it negates the whole point of using license-plate readers. Such readers apparently would be worthless, except for once in a long while when they note the recent location of a stolen car. In cost-benefit terms, they would seem like a colossal waste, because LPRs cost around $20,000—each.

>The police seem to agree that license-plate readers collect personal information, too. As Arlington Police Chief Douglas Scott said in response to Cuccinelli's advisory, ""if we were limited by the Attorney General's opinion, (LPRs) wouldn't be worth the investment. To simply use (them) only for a stolen-auto hit … kind of defeats the investigative purpose and the opportunity to have something like that.""

>Indeed. License plate readers have an ""investigative purpose"" precisely because they do not simply note license plates and nothing more. They also record location in time and space. And since most people usually drive their own cars, that means LPRs enable the government to track and record a person's movements. The vast majority of the time, agencies do so without any apparent justification. In one comparable case in California, more than 99 percent of the plates recorded in a database belonged to vehicles unconnected to any crime.

>License plate readers that provided the authorities with no personal information would be pointless, because cars don't commit crimes; only people do. So one of two things seems to be true about license plate readers. Either they do not record any personal information, in which case they are worthless as a crime-fighting tool. Or they do record personal information—about tens of thousands of people who are not criminals, without any reasonable grounds for suspicion.

>In short, they are either useless or they are an invasion of privacy. Which is it?

"From what I understand, all Flock does is capture images of license plates and the rear of the car. It encrypts and stores those images and purges them after thirty days if not requested by law enforcement or someone who has been granted access to them? I'll need to read more about that. It does cross reference the plate with NCIC, which can alert local police to ""hot files"" such as AMBER Alerts, stolen vehicles, and wanted persons. It does not query the DMV database, which means that none of that information is stored anywhere or known by the system - name, social security number, address, license and registration status, etc. The plate still has to be ran by a person with access to the state's system. So you shouldn't need to worry about silly things like expired tags or driving while under suspension.

I'm more concerned about how it's integrated with NCIC, and what sort of security precautions are taken in that regard. As long as it's snapping license plates on public roadways or for businesses where it's permitted, it's whatever. If it starts taking pictures of me and facial recognizes my dog while we're walking down the sidewalk, then yeah, there's a problem. ALPR systems have been in use for decades, and in any city or suburban environment it is hard to be somewhere that isn't on camera anyways.

"Let’s clarify my objection with my neighbor:

-	His house is vacant, is an eyesore, and he’s been “renovating” it for 10+ years
-	He has a double-wide driveway and 2 car garage that are empty. He can park 6 cars there
-	He has room for 3 cars along the curb in front of his house
-	We have a single wide driveway and only enough room for one car along the curb

So yeah, when he shows up from time to time to “work” on his vacant house, and he chooses to park along the curb in the spot furthest from his house purely to prevent our cars from overlapping his property a little bit, instead of parking in his own driveway, I have an issue with him.

"Well this probably won't be any actual help ..because I don't know for sure .. but I thought most properties just went to the curb were it ends. And the street is thus public property/city property.  
     And anyone could park a vehicle on it as long as there was nothing else posted stating something different ..  but could be any number of cars in all fairness someone parking that dies not have a property close by or in the area at all.

So it's kinda like a first come first served basis ..just as much as you have a right to park anywhere on the street as you do. The same right goes to any and everyone else to do the same...

But again I don't know for sure ...just what I thought or assumed to be that way my life of 46 years ...could be totally wrong !!

"I'm quite a bit late to this but love living downtown so I have to chime in.  I am in my early thirties and have lived downtown for 4 years, downtown proper for 3.  I'm in south park now, but lived 100 N Jefferson, pre-remodel.  Prices to live downtown proper have definitely gone up.  I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find something under $800 for downtown proper.  Average is probably $1K, if not higher.  I will say that it is a lot of fun, especially if you like to go out.  There are so many breweries, bars, and restaurants that have been added.  There's also ax throwing at twosocial along with arcade games.  Oregon is always a good time, especially with them starting DORA, shutting down the street and allowing people to drink outside on it.  I'm really hoping the festivals pick up again this year.  There feels like there is something at Riverscape every weekend in the summer.  Dragon's games are cheap and are a blast.  I miss looking out my window and seeing the street was crowded with cars, then walking around to investigate and discovering a festival at riverscape, an event at the convention center, a free concert at Levitt, etc.  Highly suggest it.  I will say that the lack of a grocery store does blow.  The nearest is Kroger on Wayne, which is definitely sketchy.
