"There are quite a few cults in Cincinnati that just seem to be able to ride well under the radar and thanks to the chaos and further cultural struggle which COVID-19 brought, their cruising still remains. There are the old school groups such as the Mormon and Unification Churches, the Jehovahs Witnesses and the SDA Church. There are also the hipster churches such as the international Churches of Christ as well as the ongoing efforts of the Xenos / Dwell cult in Columbus to penetrate. I spent a week with a production company in Columbus helping create a documentary that will soon be released upon the victimization of so many in that Columbus based group. There's so much more that can be told but the best way to detect them yourself is to learn what cults are and how they operate. Cultism can assume a lot of forms and you don't have to panic about that just be aware that they are out there. Our podcast really gets into that and is here .. in fact our latest podcast is on Xenos / Dwell.

"Yes, this coffee shop is owned and run by members of The Madison Place Church‚Äîformerly known as Gladstone Community Church. Their worship building is across the street on Plainville Rd. They changed their name after bad press from the above-mentioned Cincinnati Magazine article. While some of the ‚Äúelders‚Äù (all men in their 30s) were mentored by those in the Mariemont Community Church, they are separate institutions‚Äîthough some hold close ties to them, including some family ties.

All the money made by the coffee shop is filtered directly into the coffers of the church. ‚ÄúMembers‚Äù live together in separate communal homes for men and women; many of them are on Grace Ave. 

Many in the church are gay (but believe they‚Äôve been ‚Äúcured of it‚Äù through their faith), they live in ‚Äúcommon purse,‚Äù meaning they share their resources (all money goes to the elders for allotment) based on a scripture from Acts 2, and they target people at crossroads in their lives, such as former sex workers or addicted people. They run ‚ÄúLazarus Rooms‚Äù which guide drug-addicted people through withdrawal, which is dangerous and not officially or professionally sanctioned at all. 

They have recently moved toward teaching against marriage and romantic relationships, as they believe that any desire for personal benefit is sinful or a temptation from satan. Several of the older members who weren‚Äôt in the general age group (20s-40s) have left, along with other younger ones. In order to buy homes without scrutiny, the elders will have individual members buy homes in their name, but they sign its control and use over to the elders.

One of the things that bothers me most is that the coffee shop makes Instagram posts touting their support of ‚Äúlocal businesses‚Äù‚Äîspecially a chocolate business. But here‚Äôs the rub: the chocolate business, their landscaping business, their house-flipping business, the renovated soon-to-be Airbnb home they hold on Britton Ave, their apartments above the coffee shop and their daycare and their catering, etc. businesses? They‚Äôre ALL owned by the same church (controlled by the elders): all the money funnels right into the same source, which has to be legally questionable at best.

When you pair this with the fact that there are some VERY disgruntled/traumatized former members, families are concerned because they don‚Äôt see their children anymore, and the fact that this church no doubt collected the thousands of dollars per-person for the COVID stimulus funds‚Äîit all becomes clearer and darker.

This ‚Äúchurch‚Äù may not meet the traditional classification of a cult, but all the features are there and thriving, unfortunately. It‚Äôs a beautifully remodeled coffeeshop, but I cannot in good conscience support them. It has to collapse on itself at some point.",t2_b8rfn5ux,Agitated_Ad3409,0,1648846452.0,0,t1_i314z6a,i314z6a,True,manateetoes,t3_tt8lfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/tt8lfb/the_madison_place_a_cult/,The Madison Place = a cult???,/r/cincinnati/comments/tt8lfb/the_madison_place_a_cult/i314z6a/,13,r/cincinnati,0,13

"For the bigger honeysuckle I cut it off as close to the ground as possible and then immediately paint the fresh cut with RoundUp concentrate. Another strategy is to wrap the stump in a black trash bag or something opaque. With RoundUp I have to spray the suckers and/or cut them off 3-4 more times during the year. You can't easily kill off the larger root system and it's really hard to dig out so you just have to kill off each attempt to start growing again. Eventually the plant starves w/o leaves.

I am no expert on the risk of a landslide. Honeysuckle is not great for erosion control though, there are much better plants/shrubs/trees that you can plant. But there's going to be a period where things are bare. Maybe time it after the rainy spring and get something planted and growing over the summer? Even if you cut it down the roots are going be there for a while (but rain will be hitting the ground directly). You have some time to work with.

"OK if that's how you see it, but I see this exact same post disparaging some teams every year and it truly is just lazy, pointless and wrong. 

Here's the deal, almost every single year there's at least one maybe 3-4 teams who stumble down the stretch and end up missing the NCAA cut - and then go on to stack up 3-4-5 wins over fairly impressive mid-tier opponents, meaning somewhere in the 45-65 national rankings areas, meaning that if they'd done the same thing a month ago there'd never have even been a conversation about whether they were in or out. This year it happened to be X but for those counting at home they just went 3-0 vs #5, #7, #10 SEC teams in the NIT and are 1-0 vs B1G, 1-0 vs ACC and 1-1 vs Big 12 - so 6-1 overall vs Power Five non-conf teams this season. Their final season rankings will prolly be in the 40-50ish range across the various lists which would put them - and the similar teams each season - well above at least 1/3 and maybe 1/2 of the teams that actually played in the NCAA tourney.

"This is a little ways out of the city, but Pop's Pizza in Winchester, Ohio (Adams County) is fantastic. We've spent years with Snappy as our only option until these guys came along. Not only are their pizzas great, but their hoagies are huge and delicious too.

Plus they run fun specials all the time. If you said ""who dey"" when you pre ordered super bowl pizza, you got a free order of wings.

Edit - My favorite is their BLT pizza. It has bacon, then cold lettuce and tomato and mayo drizzled on it. Sounds crazy, but its delicious.

"Thanks for sharing our Best of Cincinnati issue! It's a huge undertaking to coordinate, so we appreciate that folks are reading it. There's something new to discover about Cincy in here for all of us.

I do want to note that this issue has both reader picks and staff picks. It's not always apparent to everybody, but yes, readers do determine those short lists. [Here's our blog post from January about the voting process](https://www.citybeat.com/arts/citybeats-best-of-cincinnati-readers-poll-is-live-go-vote-12493025). What the readers say goes -- we publish the results exactly as they turn out (after consolidating different spellings like ""Saint"" and ""St."" and removing nominees from incorrect categories, like Taco Bell from the Best Art Museum category). Believe me, we scratch our heads about a few of the results, too, but they are what they are!

In addition to those reader lists, CityBeat writers also choose a few special moments from the past 12 months to highlight. 

Thanks again for reading.

Practice is something you do because you can, policy is something you do because you have to. 

The fact that permission slips were required should actually negate the necessity of informing every parent of the speakers and topics because if a parent was worried about it they could just refuse to let their kid attend. 

Here's another hypothetical just to illustrate the silliness of your argument: If my kid brings home a permission slip for NRA Day, I can either assume that the content will be apolitical gun safety classes and let my kid go, *or* I can assume that it will be a far-right white nationalist indoctrination given by Russian assets and refuse.
