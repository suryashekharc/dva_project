"We where running some errand and The Chicken Nugget was hungry, so we tried some Sushi Gen. 
The appetizer of crab* tempura was the best that I have ever had, same with the miso soup. 
For a main course, we ate off the lunch menu and I had the spicy yellow fish roll and eel roll. The Chicken nugget had the spicy salmon roll and the crab roll I think. All of them where…. Subpar to say the least. I don’t know I if it was because we ordered off of the lunch menu or that they where just busy but they where easily in my bottom 2 ranking when it came to taste…. Maybe we need to try it for dinner one day. But at least the appetizer and miso soup was good. 
The service was good, so that’s a plus.

Edit: fixed the numerous spelling errors…. Apparently I just flat out couldn’t type yesterday. Maybe I should start typing these reviews on my laptop and not my phone.

"Tonight we tried Southern Pho on Benton Rd. For an appetizer we had spring rolls with chicken and a peanut dipping sauce. The Chicken Nugget had the Southern Pho special and I had the Vietnamese spicy beef and pork noodle soup. 
The spring rolls didn’t have much of a taste to them unless you put them in the dipping sauce. Maybe they would have been better if we tired them with shrimp or Vietnamese ham, only one way to find out though!
You can order your food either regular or spicy and they don’t have a level of spiciness like 1-5. Just regular or spicy. We ordered our dishes spicy and they definitely delivered on the spiciness!  I’m talking nose clearing, sweating spiciness, just the way I like it!
The southern pho was good but didn’t taste like any other pho I have ever had before. Not in a bad way but it’s like they wanted to put a southern style spin on pho and honestly, they did a better job than Cajun Asian, they just didn’t have shrimp and crawfish in it like Cajun Asian does. 
Vietnamese spicy beef and pork noodle soup was also good. They used a thicker noodle than the pho. But this was also a soup and not pho, so yea.  
They had a small stage and sound system set up in the corner so I am guessing they do some kind of entertainment on the weekends but not sure.  
We will be going back to try different things because it was good and had a friendly staff!

"I would echo most of the points raised here. Lived in Shreveport for 5 years about 10 years ago in my 20s. I liked it while I was there, but honestly never thought I'd come back. Since then have lived in DC, upper midwest, NOLA, and the mountain west. All have been cool in different ways, but have big downsides too. In DC, I sat in traffic for over an hour each day. The midwest was great, but I was in a parka for 7 months of the year and shoveling snow all of the time (also not a lot of POC in Whole Foods and Trader Joes). NOLA was fun from an restaurants perspective, but traffic was annoying and crime was high. 

The mountain west has been phenomenal, but honestly the lack of affordability in my opinion negates a lot of the attractiveness of the area. I live in a 700 sq ft apartment that is within walking distance to Whole Foods, other chain grocery stores, bars, breweries, large city parks, and restaurants. I'm at the base of the mountains with endless outdoor recreation. Those things are great. But my rent for my 700 Sq ft apartment is higher than what my friends in shreveport pay for a 3 bedroom apartment and my rent will increase by 30% this upcoming year. 

In the next year I'll be transitioning to a new job and have options in Nola, Shreveport, the east coast, Florida, Arizona, and the mountain west. At this point, I will mostly likely come back to Shreveport. The cost of living in those other areas are unreal right now. I'd prefer to not live in a shoebox my whole life and buying a 4 bedroom 2 bath house in Arizona, Florida, Mountain west would cost 4x the amount of what I could buy in Broadmoor. 

In Shreveport I can have a comfortable quality of life with home ownership and save for retirement. No traffic. Nearby outdoor recreation. Decent food. A few good breweries. And Golf.  I'd rather retire at a reasonable age than live in a 700 sq ft apartment within walking distance of a bunch of breweries and Whole Foods.

I guess it comes down to the things a person values at that particular time in life. That won't be the same for everyone.

"Found the Bossierite 

In all seriousness, the entire country is like that, I had the idea in my head that leaving Shreveport meant leaving the stone age but i realized

The entire country is like this lol, every negative you've listed I've encountered here and NC is supposed to be the next thing state to move to. The one thing I will say is absolutely there's not a whole lot of great high paying jobs and it's worth leaving if you can get a cozy job somewhere else but money isn't everything.

It's really easy to get depression tinted glasses if you've lived in one place for majority of your life and it's easy to fall into the trap of ""I'll be happier if i just leave this dump"" and the may be true for some people but it definitely wasn't true for me. Shreveport has everything this place has while being 75 percent cheaper. Shreveport has great outdoor recreation, low cost of living, great food, decent transportation, amazing people.

Every time there's a natural disaster in Louisiana, you see droves of people lined up on the highways ready to help. You don't get any of that here, if you break down on the side of the road in Louisiana, someone is bound to stop and help, none of that here.

You talk to someone you pass on the street, they'll hold a conversation with you. None of that here.

My point of this post is just that I thought that leaving was the best thing in the world, and sure I may leave again and try living in the west coast, but Louisiana is always going to be home and despite how screwed up things are, we always find reasons to help each other and smile.

"This post serves to reaffirm that I never want to live in the East US. I grew up in Shreveport, spending a few years in Dallas as a teen. I left after graduating high school and have never looked back. Everytime I do come back to visit family I get really frustrated with the city and remembered why I left. The lack of public lands for recreation, terrible infrastructure, bike lanes, the local brewing scene being about 10 years behind the curve, how rude people are, and how sprawling the city can seem for how little there is to do are some of my biggest complaints.  


BUT! I agree that I'm generally just pessimistic about Shreveport. The food is great, and I really miss a lot of the events that would happen like Mudbug Madness, Mardi Gras, and the Red River Revel. The cost of living down there is still fantastic compared to most places, so cherish that while it lasts.

"Currently here with my fiance for PA school and we cannot wait to get the fuck out. I've lived in 4 major cities and several smaller towns spread across this country and IMO Shreveport is by far the worst one. We want to move back to STL that's how bad it is.

Traffic is horrible for such a small city, crime is bad, roads are the worst I've ever lived in(how the fuck is a main road like kings highway so shitty?)

 Food and alcohol prices are actually pretty high compared to other cities of a similar size. (20 bucks for a 20oz margarita at several places?)

 Car insurance tripled moving here from STL

Food options really are not diverse cajun, Mexican, Chinese and American. There are a few hidden gems but it's a pretty poor showing. 

The wealth/race disparity also pretty bad here. Go into whole foods and count how many POC  you see shopping versus running the register. Go to one of the mid-tier or high tier apartments and see how many POC you see compared to the lower tier apartments. Even just going to a restaurant, most of the workers are people of color and most the patrons are white.



Not everything's bad. It's nice to be within 15 minutes of every necessary store no matter where you live.

 And it's nice to have a level one trauma teaching hospital in the city.

 Also the homeless are not that bad here population-wise or aggressiveness.

And you are close to major highways. Easy drives to several larger cities. Although that can be said for most places in America to be honest.

There's definitely worse places to be in the country and there's definitely better, but you have to take into account mainly right now the job market and cost of living.

North Carolina for example, so many people moving here which destroyed the culture that was already established. The cost of living is extremely inflated.

"Because music is valued quite a bit here in Louisiana we actually have a pretty decent live event industry in SBC. There are always festivals, concerts, and bar gigs going on. Plus we have the casinos (none of them are doing events like they used to before covid but they used to have a lot going on, often times large shows in their theatres and small shows in their bars/restaurants). There are a few big production companies Like Paxton Sound, CSC Productions and lots of medium sized ones like Music City, Gumbo, Millenia etc. , and quite a few small time guys as well. You can do pretty well if you are competent as an audio tech/engineer or a lighting designer/tech. A lot of the larger companies book multiple gigs on the same weekends and I know from experience it can be hard to find someone reliable when you need an extra guy.

We also have a lot of different event centers like Shreveport Convention Center, Municipal Auditorium, Brookshire's Grocery Arena that are run by a company called ASM Global (formerly SMG) who employs a lot of people. They have everyone from kitchen staff, housekeeping, to event staff who do things like put up pipe and drape, set staging, etc.

Then there are the rental companies like Encore, Pelican, etc. who rent out tents, chairs, small stages, and other stuff for special events.

You also have the event labor companies like Rhino who supply stage hands to load in/set up events.

We have the local stagehand union (IATSE) that help get work for tons of rigging guys, stage hands etc. You can make REALLY good money as a rigger if you can get the proper training. A lot of times those guys make a 4 (ive heard of even a 6) hour minimum. That means if your rate is say... $36/h and you come in and hang 2 points and it takes 30 minutes.. you still get paid for 4 hours. So that's like roughly $150 dollars for 30 minutes of work.  Of course there are the huge shows where these guys work their asses off while walking on high steel 100 feet in the air and it takes a ton of knowledge and skill to do what they do, but a lot of times its a quick hang a couple points and get out.

&#x200B;

ANYWAYS. Point is we have a thriving live event industry. It's not ALL medical, military, retail and food service.

Someone correct me if im totally wrong but I think the reason the film industry isn't thriving as much here is because before they got some big tax breaks to film in Louisiana ( I wanna say when we had Bobby Jindal?), and it was cheaper for a lot of them to film in SBC and say it was NOLA or whatever.  Since the breaks are gone it's not as advantageuos  for them to come here so I think now they just stay in California like they used to a lot more. There is still a good amount of film related stuff that happens here though.

Also we have an Amazon distribution center coming to Shreveport that claim they will be creating I think 1500 jobs in the area.",t2_7s3y4h88,LiteratureNo3595,0,1648605986.0,0,t1_i2nwtry,i2nwtry,True,Moose_Breaux,t3_tr2aov,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tr2aov/what_are_the_major_job_industries_in_the_sbc_area/,What are the major job industries in the SBC area?,/r/shreveport/comments/tr2aov/what_are_the_major_job_industries_in_the_sbc_area/i2nwtry/,6,r/shreveport,0,6

The power grid is more stable than Texas'. Cost of living is reasonable. Crime is high but Jesus, Durham had the highest per capita murder rate in the country. The politics are actually less crazy than Texas. I mean corrupt and dysfunctional, always, but still. I'd take JBE over Abbott. There are several universities (and I know NSU has an IT program because I was in it for a while).

"My whole experience living here has changed my outlook on Shreveport.

At first I couldn't wait to leave and was excited to be in a new place but I've realized just how great Shreveport can be if you look at it without the depression tinted glasses.

Shreveport should have been a great city but the statewide corruption and lack of smart investment really screwed everything over.

Shreveport has always been two steps behind everyone else. 

Durham for example is about the same size population and area wise, but instead of clinging to the failing tobacco industry and railroad, they invested in tech and healthcare and now Durham has the largest research park in the country.

Shreveport should have transitioned from an oil based economy a long time ago. There's way too much brain drain and not enough recreation to keep the youth excited about staying.

We let Dallas completely over encompass us and now there's very little reason to stay if you're not satisfied with the way things are.

But now after seeing majority of the east coast, i realized just how affordable north west Louisiana is and how you can start a family in Shreveport and live comfortably. If you need the big city hustle Dallas is pretty close but you can have your cake and eat it too if you choose to.

I figure eventually Shreveport is going to get hit with the same gentrification that the rest of the country is seeing but right now, I'm just glad people can still live comfortably despite not having all the bells and whistles the rest of the country has.",t2_4dfn2it0,kitsachie,0,1648484142.0,0,t1_i2gbnir,i2gbnir,False,unknownguardians,t3_t6lhgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/t6lhgp/moving_to_shreveport_from_kansas_city_this/,"moving to shreveport from kansas city this weekend, and have never been to the city before!",/r/shreveport/comments/t6lhgp/moving_to_shreveport_from_kansas_city_this/i2gbnir/,1,r/shreveport,0,1

"Everyone i know here is trying to leave, the locals are angry that prices have gone up, the transplants all keep to themselves, Durham is still being mismanaged. All these big rent and realtors keep buying out everything and jacking the prices up without actually improving anything. 

I was originally going to stay in this chateaux style apartment in chapel hill and boom right when I was finishing everything, it got bought out and they increased rent to 1400 a month for a dinky one bedroom.

I also just had a huge culture shock of how unfriendly people are here and the racism is way more blatant than it is in the deep south.

The college kids are all insufferable and hyper liberal, all here with their parents money. This state is amazing but genuinely it's going the same route Austin and California are going. South Carolina is still great from my experience there but North Carolina as a whole has been gentrified to hell. 

I was amazed at how bluntly racist this place is too, they're actively trying to price out lower income people and targeting black businesses. (Prominent black business man owned a shop in the mall in Durham and the company terminated his lease because they blamed him for the spike in violent crime in the mall)

I moved here with someone else and we separated so there didn't feel like any reason for me to stay and there barely a sense of community here. Just mean locals rightfully angry about transplants and tons of narcissists working from home with huge income differences than the locals.

"Watch me defend:

White people in America subjugated black people for 400 years. Once they were freed, they were restricted in every way they could be restricted — couldn’t eat where we eat, live where we live, walk where we walk, bank where we bank, learn where we learn, or vote without barrier. 

Even today, there are active efforts to keep them from accesssing resources including financial and even constitutional rights by ignoring the burdens we systematically implemented. These things have pretty much exclusively been effectuated by white politicians and white business owners and empowered by white malice, indifference, and deflection (that’s the part you’re doing). The generational poverty that resulted from those actions has led to blight and crime which we in turn blame on them. Meanwhile white divestment/flight has amplified that feedback loop.

Until that boot is off their neck and we actually clear the space for real opportunity and meaningful repair of the bridges between our communities, the only thing we white people should be concerning themselves with is the plank in our eye. Anything else isn’t really our business or place and is seen, rightly, as missing the forest for the trees and further subjugation by telling people who we have legally and financially limited how they should fix their community. That’s what’s indefensible.

The argument that poor neighborhoods are poor because the people in them are poor is not a novel concept or a smart observation.

The reason money is an issue for many people, especially a city with 54% black residents in the former capitol of the Confederacy, a bastion of Jim Crow, and a place where the federal government had to step in to address political segregation in the 1970s… is race. The lack of generational wealth and the cyclical nature of poverty are major contributing factors to blight and crime. How are you not following this?

So when we talk about white flight, what we mean is places like Highland - which was once a brand new expensive white subdivision, that transitioned to a rentier neighborhood after segregation ended.   The property owners left the neighborhood, parceled many of the houses into duplexes and quadplexes, and rented them out.  But it’s still very expensive for most people to buy property, even there, so most of the working class are stuck renting, and renting from landlords who live elsewhere and have little incentive to fund or improve their properties or the community.

"I rent from 318, and can confirm, they’re “good” landlords. Very responsive to issues - I live in an old house = tree roots in the plumbing, and every 2 months or so when it starts backing up, they’re here within hours to clear out the pipes. Our AC completely shit the bed last summer, and they made sure we didn’t need a portable unit (we also had 2 window units) while we waited for the parts. Basically, if you rent in highlands or Broadmoor, you’re going to mostly be dealing with very old houses, so it’s pretty important to make sure you’ve got a property manager who actually deals with rentals, as they’ve got the staff or connections to get stuff done quickly.

That being said, property management rentals don’t usually come cheap (at minimum $900/mo for a house, and more likely 1200ish if we’re being realistic for a better house in “good” section of the ‘hood), so if you’re looking for cheaper alternatives, the poster who put the map and told you to drive around looking for signs is your best bet.

* Gilmer Bayou starts near Greenwood
* Boggy Bayou starts near the TX line
* Gilmer empties into Boggy North of Keithville and Boggy continues SE

------
* Keatchie Bayou starts just North of the town of Keachi (yes, the bayou has a T and the town doesn't)
* Cypress Bayou starts a little North of Keatchie Bayou and forms most of the border between Caddo and DeSoto Parishes
* Keatchie empties into Cypress between Stonewall and Keithville and Boggy continues NE

-------
* Boggy Bayou Joins Cypress where I-49 crosses into DeSoto and just before it becomes Wallace Lake

_______

After the Wallace Lake Dam, Cypress Bayou becomes Wallace Bayou until it runs into Bayou Pierre at Hwy 175 a little South of Ellerbe Rd. Google Maps calls this segment Bayou Pierre, but Google Maps is wrong.

"There are food pantries, some of which I think are no questions asked, but they don't operate anything like what it looks like FNB does in terms of partnerships with growers and grocers.

I do think about the community fridge concept, which might be a bit easier to start and grow from there, but I've never done anything like the scale and frequency of FNB, so I'm only speculating. Organizing can be quote hard here, but it can happen if you find the right group of people who believe in the cause. 

We do have a group, for example, who is working daily to ferry immigrants who are released after being detained in Louisiana who are basically dumped on the side of the road. Because it is daily work, they have struggled hard with burnout and are actively working to become a nonprofit formally so that they can create a structure necessary for daily work.

So anytime I think of a mutual aid operation here, I think about how hard it is to get a great volume of volunteers for any length of time simply because of our population size and the amount of poverty in the community, meaning that if my assumption is correct, the amount of free time per capita is really low.

"Wifey is out of town for the night so I asked The Chicken Nugget what she wanted to do. Her response, let’s get Cajun Asian Togo and then play video games at the house!  Who am I one to say no to that?  
So we had the crawfish wontons, Cajun Pho and Cajun PadThai. If you like your wontons made with thin dough, then you will like these. The Pad Thai had a good kick to it and good flavor, only bad thing is that I work about 20 minutes away from them and then it’s about 10 minutes away from the house. So the noodles kinda conformed to the shape of the container but that’s my fault and not the restaurant’s fault since I placed the order online before I left work. The Chicken Nugget got the Cajun Pho, some assembly required. It was good but as you can see in the picture, it seems like everything was cooked without seasoning and the seasoning was just tossed on top when it was put in the container. This may have been different if we ate there instead of getting it Togo, prior experiences at this place we had always eaten at the restaurant.

Edit: sorry if this post is a bit all over but I am paying more attention to my daughter right now than making this post. Only posting between changing games or I died in a game. 
But the Cajun Pho looked better than it tasted. It was average pho with Cajun spice, sausage and crawfish added in. The Cajun pad Thai had a good flavor and spice to me but the peanuts they used did taste like they came right out of a planters nut can.  Not the best in town but we will still be going back.

"I was born here in shreveport a year after the Cedar Grove Riot. While there is plenty to rightfully complain and lament about our fair city, it is heartening to see we have come as far as we have in terms of acceptance. (Not to say we are perfect because lord knows we have many many many miles to go. Racism and Homophobia are still alive and well, but its much harder to be an out and out bigot in this town than it used to be....unless your trans. That seems to still be acceptable to be a bigot about)

 I see through this particular case it is really a divide between the over 50s and under 50s. Bossier High School alumni here. We had a gay music teacher. None of the Staff or parents seemed to know. But we students knew and didn't give a damn. Much the same with this teacher. Those kids don't look at their teacher with anything other than ""My teacher makes me feel happy and glad to come to class"". Kids have an amazing capacity to not be assholes.

"Myself and The Chicken Nugget have been eating at Thai and Japanese kitchen for several years now. Back since they had the blue benches that where falling apart or had rips in them. Back when the A/C hardly worked and the menus where falling apart. 
A lot had changed since then but the food hasn’t. It’s always been good!  FYI, they redid the menus again. 
We had the Kamikaze sushi roll for an appetizer. Wifey ordered red curry, The Chicken Nugget ordered the green curry and I had the Pad Thai, spice level 4 out of 5. My only complaint about Thai and Japanese Kitchen, was that it seemed like they where scared to give people the spicy level they wanted. This time however, I asked for a level 4 and I got a 4!!!  This was also my first time getting Pad Thai here and I have to say that it didn’t disappoint. Was full of flavors and spices!  The Green and Red curry’s where also very good, still the best in town in my opinion. We showed up before the dinner crowd, so we didn’t have to wait for a seat or wait long for our food either. When we left, the place was full and it was taking a bit longer for people to get their food. I really have nothing negative to say about this place, just a tip. Since the A/C unit in the dinning room is back on with it getting warm outside now, bring a jacket or a pullover with you. If they seat you below that A/C, your going to get cold!

"Firstly, I am very sorry that you are having to deal with this. I know how frustrating it is to be buried under school system bureaucracy. It is clear that you are also very intelligent, and I know how it makes it that much more unbearable. 

A previous comment mentioned focusing on the ADHD, and I agree with what they said. Seeking accommodation for that should be your focus, since there are more legal implications with the 504 status. 

Record all audio from your next hearing. You do NOT have to let them know they are being recorded if you don’t want to. It’s perfectly legal in this state to record audio without their consent. Hopefully you don’t have to get legal with them. But if you happen to drop a line about finding a lawyer because your rights under 504 are being infringed upon, they might change their tune a bit. Document everything in case it does come down to a legal battle. 

Best of luck to you. Most of the schools here are so overwhelmed by the amount of IEP/IAPs they handle on a daily basis, and students with them that aren’t “difficult to deal with” and perform to a satisfactory degree usually get neglected. There isn’t malicious intent behind it; your teachers are just very, VERY overwhelmed given what has happened in the last two years.",t2_547nsk8p,lky830,0,1647643644.0,0,t1_i17pq4a,i17pq4a,True,Sufficient_Cicada837,t3_tgv6yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tgv6yx/extremely_frustrated_with_how_our_schools_handle/,Extremely frustrated with how our schools handle accommodations.,/r/shreveport/comments/tgv6yx/extremely_frustrated_with_how_our_schools_handle/i17pq4a/,1,r/shreveport,0,1

You are not alone.  My son is in 5th grade and has ADHD and autism.  We get the same treatment because he make “straight A grades” that he doesn’t have an issue.  Every year we have to go through the same issues with accommodations and getting teachers on the same page.  The administrations at the school and parish level are garbage and will do nothing without you having an advocate.

"Hello! I want to first say how sorry I am that your needs aren't being met in the school setting. Regardless of what a school system says, your diagnoses are valid.  

Unfortunately, the school seems to be handling things by the letter of the law.  School systems have long used more strict standards for meeting diagnoses such as autism. It's ridiculous, but it is what it is for now. I have known many people who are autistic and never had that acknowledged by the school system. This is very frustrating for students,  teachers, and parents.

I want to address some of the things you mentioned directly, then share some ideas about working within the system that might help. 
IQ tests: they are outdated, but a required part of any IEP evaluation. 

Neurodivergent assessments are notoriously bad at diagnosing females that are autistic. They are also old and come from the time it was believed only boys had autism and that they would outgrow it ( all so very false).

The IEP team is not only listening to your mom, even though it feels like it. They are required to use phrases such as, ""Her mother feels..."" in order to record parent concerns. They use phrases such as ""alleged autism,"" to note that the school is not seeing the qualifications for the diagnoses in their testing (which again is designed to not qualify everyone, only those that ""need"" accommodations), while I completely disagree with the process, it sounds like they are following it. 

While you and your parents decide if you wish to request more assessment from the school, I recommend you approach individual teachers and ask for preferential seating where you feel less distracted. Explain to them that you are autistic and have ADHD and that you are working to maintain your excellent GPA. Most teachers are happy to work with you. 

If your doctor has diagnosed you with ADHD, you can request a 504 medical plan, that includes accommodations. Since ADHD is a medical condition, they cannot deny you that. I'm guessing they are so busy looking for your autism that they missed the fact you are diagnosed ADHD. Many of the ADHD accommodations mirror accommodations typically used with autistic persons (extended time, breaks, preferred seating, etc). Honestly, this is your best bet. If the school refuses this, after a note from your doctor saying you have ADHD, contact the school board office and ask to talk to the head of the 504 department. They can help you. If they don't, call the state office and so forth. 

Finally,  this process is long, even in the clearest cut cases. It is frustratingly long and can be overwhelming. I am sincerely sorry you are experiencing this.",t2_dehjt1a,donnapict,0,1647618484.0,0,t1_i15zk0b,i15zk0b,True,Sufficient_Cicada837,t3_tgv6yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tgv6yx/extremely_frustrated_with_how_our_schools_handle/,Extremely frustrated with how our schools handle accommodations.,/r/shreveport/comments/tgv6yx/extremely_frustrated_with_how_our_schools_handle/i15zk0b/,2,r/shreveport,0,2

"I’m very sorry that this has been your experience. Is that staff member who doubts your diagnosis older? The way autism and ADHD are viewed now is much different than before and it seems (relatively) younger tend to understand these new ideas of them better. That’s why I ask. I have ADHD but my mom denied that I did. My brother was diagnosed and was the hyperactive type so she didn’t think I was since I got better grades. I went undiagnosed and still don’t have an official diagnosis but the psychologist said it might be that along with my depression. My wife is autistic and ADHD as well. She was also a gifted student and no one ever picked up on her disabilities. 

Like you said they can’t legally keep you from receiving accommodations from an IEP and suing would be a breeze if they do. I don’t understand why they think they can test you and do better. Testing at all seems very suspicious. If you have an official diagnosis from a psychologist or psychiatrist that should be all you need. You might go over this staff members head to the special ed person for the district to voice your concerns.

I still visit Chicago despite its crime rate. I still go to Lower Manhattan and walk streets at night. Again, Austin is brutal with the homeless and aggressive tactics, but it’s not hard to say “I’m sorry I can’t help you today” and they move on even if they yell at you after. Just keep walking.

My girlfriend has no problem walking downtown Shreveport at night and she hasn’t had an issue. She did it the other night to go to the Robinson for an event. Drunk visitors at clubs like Sand Bar cause more issues than the homeless. We even go sit and talk with the homeless sometimes (the ones that want to talk anyway). In my opinion, the downtown homeless are more harmless than some of the home-owning neighbors I’ve lived next to in this city.

For anyone reading this who wonders how to handle a situation with the homeless downtown: say “I’m sorry I can’t help you tonight, but best of luck and be well” takes care of about 99% of interactions which _might_ happen once a week if you’re downtown every day of the week.",t2_73s7a,chrisplyon,0,1647609843.0,0,t1_i15eqrp,i15eqrp,False,JustinGitelmanMusic,t3_tbfxr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tbfxr0/anybody_think_noble_savage_will_reopen/,Anybody think Noble Savage will reopen?,/r/shreveport/comments/tbfxr0/anybody_think_noble_savage_will_reopen/i15eqrp/,1,r/shreveport,0,1

Saying Broadmoor has more muggings ain't exactly braggin' rights.  We take ours and our community's safety very seriously.  It's why we partner with those that we do.

You seem to carve out getting mugged as the only thing that would cause a reasonable person to rightly perceive a threat to their safety and that of others.

Crime is not without victims.  Safety has a lot more involved than not getting mugged. 

And you already know that.

You bought last time, I'll get this next time.

"My wife works at the school (but not for the school board) and I have two kids who go there. So here's my best summary of events as I understand them.

- There's a non-binary transgender music teacher at University Elementary.

- Teacher was under the impression that they weren't allowed to instruct kids to use their preferred honorific (Mx.) and pronouns (they/them).

- Teacher makes a tiktok lamenting this but doesn't specify the school or city only stating they teach in Louisiana. Tiktok goes semi-viral.

- Some in the school board admin wanted the teacher to get in trouble for the tiktok.

- It's ultimately decided the teacher can't be punished for the tiktok as it was done outside of school and doesn't name the school.

- The principal informs the teacher that they can in fact ask the kids to use their chosen honorific and pronouns. Teacher proceeds to do so. Kids comply and don't seem to mind. 

- Principal sends out an E-mail instructing rest of faculty and admin use their preferred honorific and pronouns as well.

- One member of faculty/admin posts the e-mail to social media.

- Some parents after seeing the post contact the school asking for their children to not attend the teacher's class. They are denied as elementary schools don't offer customized curriculum (especially not for bigoted reasons).

- Principal is called to meeting with all of CPSB legal where they inform her she's done everything right so far.

- With the matter now more or less settled, the best the transphobes can do is have a school board meeting to rabble rouse where they use the guise of dress code to complain as the teacher has a habit of dressing flamboyantly.

Incidentally, they're a great teacher. When my third grader started piano lessons a little less than a year ago, his teacher was impressed with how much they had already taught him.",t2_8qrtw,JonnyAU,0,1647439553.0,0,t1_i0vwk10,i0vwk10,False,JuliePhoenix,t3_tffplr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/tffplr/parents_clash_at_louisiana_school_board_meeting/,Parents clash at Louisiana school board meeting over nonbinary teacher.

"You can have up to 6 laying hens (no roosters) in Shreveport. There are specific rules in the ordinance pertaining to how they’re required to be housed and the minimum distance they should be kept from homes and other buildings etc. Those who rent must have permission from their landlord to keep chickens on the property. 

Bossier does not allow chickens, but reside in Benton and I’m pretty sure there is no limit plus you can have goats.

If you’re considering getting chickens it’s best to do it in a way where you don’t push your limits and you’re respectful of your neighbors. The ordinance guidelines are incredibly fair: they’re meant to keep your chickens and humans/pets in the surrounding area safe and happy.

"Oh I know people are working their ass off...my comment was not meant as a knock to them. Chase at fattys is a good buddy of mine and the dude has poured his blood sweat and tears to making something special in downtown. We still go towntowm more than any other area when we want a night out, but the simple fact is it's just not what itg used to be. You used to be able to bar hop just under the bridge. We could grab dinner and massive margs from Nickeys, hit happy hour at proud mary's, take in the patio at fatty's, play pool or shuffleboard at fully stacked...and that was JUST under the bridge. Everything I mentioned minus Fatty's is abandoned now. Events are awesome and we're out there for everyone from mudbug to st. fatty's day to bourbon and bbq....but go on a normal night and tell me it's not dead. Homeless people have taken over under the bridge and stretches of Texas street. They aren't violent and won't hassle you which is nice, but when you see more homeless than people walking and enjoying a night...it feels dead and off. Pop in pizza is awesome...but I drive downtown for a slice...then what? There is there is only fattys until Stray cat opens. No parish, no noble, no fully stacked. Also...we would love to support RFC, but they have the oddest movie times I've ever seen. We've tried to go some weekends and there have been almost no showings at all.

"There is a lot more to the downtown library than the homeless population. Libraries are notoriously known as welcoming spaces for people who don’t have anywhere to go during the day, that is not exclusive to downtown Shreveport.

The downtown library has really cool shit on the third floor- things you can’t find anywhere else in the region or state. They also offer BPCC test prep regularly and host book sales seasonally.

"Downtown isn’t dead, y’all just act like “parking” is a real problem because you have to walk a few blocks. Get over that and there are plenty of things to enjoy.

Pop n Pizza & Cookie Bs Smoothies just had ribbon cutting events yesterday. Popn has seating at their new downtown location and is selling by the slice, so there is reason to “park” if you want a slice.

I went to Missing Link for lunch last week and the place was CROWDED- full. The food is definitely bar forward and they have trivia nights etc… if I was a person who went out at night I’d definitely be going there.

Between The Lot & Festival Plaza there are events from spring until late fall that go all day and into the night. Bars like Stray Cat and Fattys are open for whatever after party you want to have. Ghost Ramen is now at Stray Cat from like 10AM - 6PM several nights a week. 

As much as downtown (and all of the residents and workers) need a nice small grocery, they can still go grab organic produce and locally sourced food at Cotton St farms.

Agora Borealis has art, gifts, and glass blowing as well as regular events. And let’s not forget that downtown has several gallery spaces and an art walk every month. The Andress has events every Saturday and the Second Saturday is their main popup weekend. Our art community also frequently puts together events in the downtown area.

Up For Brunch opened within the last year and it’s one of the few awesome brunch places we have in the entire city, and it’s DOWNTOWN. Rhino stays busy during the day and evening and doesn’t close much earlier than the South location. 

There are a lot of people working really hard to bring business and events to downtown and the only thing hurting downtown is the mentality that there is nothing there or that parking is somehow a struggle. You can usually park in front of most of these businesses. When we went to Missing Link last week we walked three blocks from where we parked. We could have potentially parked closer. It cost me 50 cents to park, and the walk was lovely. There is also only a fee for parking during regular weekday business hours. I’ve never walked more than 4 blocks for parking downtown, even for events.

If you don’t go there then you’re killing it. But downtown is not “DEAD”, as I invite you to visit other cities where the downtown is actually dead. People are just constantly fighting the “there’s nowhere to park and nothing to do” fake news disinformation crowd.

"Without giving out person information, The Chicken Nugget had a seasonal job at a local bakery making KingCakes.
