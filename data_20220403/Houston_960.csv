Urban sprawl exacerbates the issue for metro/public transportation.

America is one of the most armed countries in the world. Has more handgun deaths with suicides outpacing murders. Murder is also high and after decades of decreases has been on an marked uptick in all major metro areas.

Lol. I lived in that shithole of a city for 2 years without a working toilet because piece of shit city officials refused to give me a permit to connect my house to sewer.

"Good cops don't have to die like this. 

Houston roads are some of the most poorly maintained, poorly policed, and poorly driven I've ever seen. And I'm talking compared to 3rd world countries where traffic signals are more of a suggestion than a rule.

For example, San Felipe at 610, the lane shifts nearly 6 inches from right to left as you cross the intersection. 

Example 2, Sage Rd at Alabama, 2 lanes cut a 45 degree angle across the intersection to the point that every other light you have a vehicle merging incorrectly and cutting people off.

Example 3, I've intentionally not put my updated registration sticker on my windshield. It expired 11/2021 because I was convinced Houston PD do not even bother checking. I'm in Uptown, which has a decent police presence. 2021 still going strong.

Example 4, and this may come as a shock but in most major cities, cops don't have to double as paid traffic enforcement for private businesses to offset poor pay. I'm pretty sure that Houston cops conduct more road policing while off duty than they do while on duty in this capacity.

Example 5, the drivers. Let's say it together, ""trucks are not sports cars. You're going to hurt yourself or someone else.""

Example 6, the drivers again. Get off your fucking phones. Spend an hour on a Houston freeway and you'll catch someone who looks like they're driving drunk but is actually checking text messages.

HPD needs to put the fear of God into Houston drivers. Driving is a privilege not a right. This is going to get worse as Houston's population increases. That means stiffer penalties, meaningful handsfree laws, and better road trafficking.",t2_60h93vjh,theYetiDidIt,0,1649009264.0,0,t1_i39153c,i39153c,True,rilnow,t3_tv9r98,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/tv9r98/harris_county_pct_7_deputy_jennifer_chavis_who/,"Harris County Pct. 7 deputy Jennifer Chavis, who was killed in a major crash caused by an alleged drunk driver",/r/houston/comments/tv9r98/harris_county_pct_7_deputy_jennifer_chavis_who/i39153c/,2,r/houston,0,2

I recently moved into a new suburb, and in just a couple months I've seen two dog attacks, and multiple near misses with vehicles.

Why? 

Because people don't have the common sense to keep their pitbulls on a lead/leash, and choose to drive about 30mph in a narrow residential street full of parked cars.

Why?

Because they're fucking idiots.

I recently had a truck that was behind me, aggressively honk at me repeatedly, because I was waiting for traffic to slow before turning onto a busy frontage road right next to a highway (I was waiting for the road to be clear enough, for me to turn onto it)

Why? 

Because these people are just straight up fucking idiots.

"And I just explained why other motorcyclists find such explanations to be bs. Stop blocking traffic, one day someone might just illegally run you over. Would be an awful shame.

Lane splitting was designed as a means to prevent air cooled motorcycles from breaking down on the freeway. It's highly abused in CA and most people who do it are breaking the law by doing it well above posted speeds. I'm apathetic. It doesn't do anything now but fast track motorcycle traffic flow with modern tech.

"My settings are 76 at night, 80 during the day, and 77-78 if we have company over or if it isn't over 90F outside.

>I thought native Houstonians would be sleeping at 80-odd, too.

That is hilarious. No. Most natives here set their thermostats below 73F at night. Almost universally any time a native Houstonian comes to visit I warn them I keep my thermostats high to save on the electric bill and for conservation reasons. They all say ""yeah me too!"" and yet all of them burst into sweat after a few minutes indoors asking if my AC is broken. All of them thought keeping their thermostat at 72F was ""keeping it higher than most folks."" 

Understand I am not trying to be rude and talk down on others, I myself am a native to this city. But cheap rates for the past few decades have created a generation of folks here who don't know life without air conditioning/life without air conditioning set above 74F. Transplants are far more energy conscious individuals as many have dealt with higher rates or know how to live when it is warm inside your home(80F).

There are areas of Austin that experience what you experience here, and areas of Houston that experience what your extended family experience in Austin.  There are a lot of factors involved.  I don't know your situation.  You might want to try going back to the old ATT hardwire copper, you could get more reliability and still have streaming speeds over 20g.  I'm happy with the 24g that I get. I can stream Netflix and Amazon Video, at the same time, consistently and reliably with no problem, and during a hurricane, sometimes with a generator for AC, when needed.  My neighbor across the street has Xfinity and we can share in an emergency situation, they're rarely both down at the same time.  If they are, there's alway hotspotting our cellular.

"I was trying to do some basic due diligence on some streaming platforms during the pandemic and found out that the Houston Public Library has an overly restrictive firewall that targets music sites. It was blocking streaming platforms all together so that you couldn’t pull up site statistics, investor information, or artist information even if you were not streaming anything. I was curious to see if it was just blocking streaming services, so I played around trying to google various music related things and found it was also blocking most of the big lyric look-up sites. I’m not sure whether or not they are still blocking them, but depending on your research topic you might not be able to use their internet without a VPN.

"Since you asked, objectively the main cons are:


-The heat. It gets way hotter here than you can imagine. It's hard to really articulate as, yes, Dallas and other places get hotter on paper. But the combination of extremely high humidity and heat just makes Houston a constant oven. There's no ocean breeze either to cool off the area, you'd have to live in Galveston for that.


-Flooding. Buy flood insurance, all it takes is one wrong drain to be clogged and you are SOL. It isn't as bad as New Orleans, but it is a problem to be aware of. Learn routes that do not involve underpasses to get to XYZ location as some roads are designed to flood, temporarily, to protect homes


-Air quality. Pretty bad generally speaking from multiple sources(cars, trees, refineries). Not all days are that bad but Ozone Action Days are pretty constant alert here


-Crime. Houston has gotten fairly violent and it's not confined  to certain areas of the city. It is pretty sporadic/random in where it occurs. But shootings occur often, sadly over pointless items(road rage etc). There was a time we overtook Chicago in murders and gun crimes a year or two ago. Now we trade back and forth.


-Traffic/Driving. Houston still has some of the worst driving style I have seen in the USA. Every day I see red lights run, often in front of HPD officers, who do absolutely nothing for red light runners. It is inconsistent in terms of having snail-paced drivers and race-track drivers all in the same lane. The only place I have been to with similar driving styles is Los Angeles. 


-Looks. It a city of concrete. Houston is ugly as far as major cities goes. It has gotten better, but it's still not a well-kept city.

"Diversity in Houston is not like diversity in NYC.

Houston likes to bang the drum of “the most diverse city,” but it’s important to point out that Houston’s diversity is *very* spread out - just like everything in Houston is.  

In NYC, you’re riding the subway and there’s people who have heritage from at least 4 continents and a dozen nationalities.  On a single city street block you could have food outlets from a half dozen different nationalities.

In Houston, all of those people exist - but they’re rarely ever in the same spot at the same time.  Those same restaurants exist, but it might take half a tank of gas to get to all of them.  

Just be sure to check your expectations of what diversity means in this vastly spread out place.  Since you’re from NYC, I’ll put it this way - Jersey is much more an adequate description of what Houston is like - and I’d say that Jersey is modestly more functionally diverse than Houston is.",t2_16jlrw,PapaDuckD,0,1648916906.0,0,t1_i34g96v,i34g96v,True,PyrexVision00,t3_ttwamg,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/ttwamg/is_houston_a_black_hub_for_the_south_how_is/,Is Houston a black hub for the South ?

I guess all of those single-occupant SUVs are just farting rainbows and lollipops. PM2.5 particulate affects people that live up to a mile from highways. Hint: it isn't the kids in the woodlands that are getting asthma and having their life expectancies decreased.

Sorry to say, but the people that live in the areas you want to bulldoze and pollute don't want that to happen. Who should have more say in this situation?

> next time you come out for a concert at Cynthia Mitchell, you’ll enjoy a better driving experience once the freeway is done

That's the stupidest fucking part. The current freeway is mostly fine if you aren't driving at peak commuting times. It wouldn't benefit me if I was driving to a concert. 

The Houston metro area now has $7 million people and this project will cost $9 billion, which works out to $1,285.71 per person.

"I moved from a small border town in Texas and here's what I noticed about this city as someone living on their own for the first time. 

Electricity is pretty expensive. If you heard about the freeze that killed people in Texas, you know our grids are awful. I had damage that cost half as much as my house because of the pipes bursting. Of course, while it nearly never freezes here, seems like lots of places are not energy efficient and you can pay a lot, even if you have a good renewable energy provider.

You'll want to check the crime rate wherever you go, something I didn't even know was a possibility before. I paid well over $1000 on crappy, roach-filled studio apartments and went through car thefts, attempted break-ins, and actual break-ins at different places because it never occurred to me that you're able to see which places are more dangerous. Just because something is pricey doesn't mean it's good. Oh, and usually the police take about an hour, up to three hours in one of my cases, to arrive should you need them. I've also had police say that what happened wasn't a priority, that they won't file a report because it would clog up the system and it wouldn't get solved anyway, that maybe I was just being paranoid and someone wasn't actually trying to break in. I don' know if that's all big cities, or Houston, or my luck those days, but research a neighborhood beforehand. 

There's great food everywhere! But it's expensive. It's like 3 or 4 dollars a taco around here. It's really diverse.

"Look, this is an age-old question- even the Vikings had opinions! Ultimately, they, in their ever-raiding (and profiting) wisdom, they settled upon a few things amongst themselves: They liked the land that would come to be known as DFW wayyyyy more than H-Town. What they called ""Vinland"" was home to many, many grapes (for wine), sweet water, and evergreen grass. They prized this new territory so greatly that they devised a cunning and effective plan: when they finally returned home, they spread tales of sweet water, clean air, friendly neighbors (i e. no redlining or industrial pollution), polite mosquitoes, and nary a paper plate in sight. They called this place ""Green Land"" and they trained mariners, navigators, to look for what we now know as Galveston Bay and head inland from there. All the while laughing up their sleeves from what they called ""Ice Land"", closer to the Red River, an altogether more fertile & wonderful land, full of mirth, magic, lower taxes, higher property values, and perfectly synchronized street lights, no matter your direction of travel, N/S or E/W!
Trust those old mariners, the Vikings. Where the signs down here may decry ""Sweet Water"", ""Belle Aire"", ""1st Colony"", ""Sugar Land"", or ""Pear Land"", each are masterful misdirection.

So these pieces of crap were 23, 19 and 17 years old. This is what they're doing?

I'm glad all three of them were caught and hopefully they get the book thrown at them. The video showed the cop saying that this has to stop. Well it's going to take the force taking it seriously. Unfortunately losing a life made it where they will take it seriously now.
