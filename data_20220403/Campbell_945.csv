Home prices have gone up a ton since I bought here. Restaurants in the area I like: Falafel Shaq, Tu Mero Mole, Royal Taj, there's a new ramen place that is pretty good I forgot the name, tapsilog bistro.

"TL;DR: Campbell has lots of nuance on land rights, and this can be a pain in the ass and expensive for the city to investigate and enforce, furthermore, escalate in ways that are unintended...because life is complicated.

It-- in part-- can depend on where in Campbell you live. As an example, if you're in the San Thomas area that was incorporated in the ~90's, many home owners actually own the street/roadway, and the city has easements to use and maintain the road, etc.

There can be special conditions/ waivers that apply since the home owners in the specific cases that I'm referencing, own the land...  It's not illegal to park a car on your property, even if it's not operable/ not in use, even if the city has an egress ingress easement... And even if the city has public parking included in the easement.

Depending on the rights explicitly listed in the easements, the city might not have the right to declare that space as eligible for public parking... And in these cases, there can be several implications that may not be favorable to the outcome you are trying to achieve. As an example, it can be up to the homeowner to determine if they want to enforce their deed rights (like towing unauthorized vehicles from their property, if they meet whatever the requirements are [such as displaying signage, etc].


Campbell is a heavily evolved town-- it started off as a sort of rural farmy town ""orchard city"", and is now an affluent suberb with some of the worlds most valuable companies headquartered within or immediately around it... So a lot of the rules and rights here are miss-matched... And because this is America, and property is a highly protected right as an anecdote, ""The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments cannot deprive any person of 'life, liberty, or property' without due process of law""' and land is property... it's difficult to streamline things... 

So the level of effort to do what your asking (at the level of scale that the city needs to preform) in a manner that upholds due process, etc... its outsized. They have better and more important things to do with their limited resources.

If you didn't try it yet, another approach can be to ask the neighbor/ try to befriend them etc.

It's a mix. There are families, married folks, unmarried couples, bachelors, married childless folks, married retired folks. For example, the 4-plex next door to me has an elderly Russian woman, an elderly gay guy, a multi-generation family, and a similar branch from that same family. Scale that out to the rest of the neighborhood. ""Slice Of Life"" normalcy.

Mostly keep to themselves but are friendly and open on a hello and some conversation depending on daily circumstance.

I'm using Comcast. Problems have been few and far between. Haven't looked into alternatives.


> What are your favorite and least favorite things about the area?

Goods: Being near JD Morgan park, the Safeway complex, the VTA hub, not too far away from downtown Campbell, and being between two main road throughways [San Tomas Expsy and Winchester Blvd]. The highway hookup to Santa Cruz is nearby as well.

Not So Goods: There can be a couple regular homeless you start to recognize simply by fact of regularity -- they're harmless but they can be around as they are doing no harm outside of existing; different landlords have different lawn management schedules, so your neighbor might be having a leaf blower going on Monday whilst your own landlord will have their leaf blower going on Thursday so there's double-dipping noise going on every week; some folks out of the La Valencia apartment complex can unnecessarily speed down Wilton Dr -- speeding up to a stop light so they can hurry up and wait type of thing -- but I don't think that happens on Adler Ave;

> Any good food recommendations?

In the Safeway complex there's Luigi's Pizza [mom & pop shop for pizza, pasta]; up the street there's Coach's Bar & Grill and their cook Fernando does good burgers [other food also available]; Uncle Jack's and Stacks are nice for breakfast//lunch; downtown there's Sushi Confidential, Blue Line Pizza which does deep dish as well, and a few other good food places. For mexican food people seem to like Casa Lupe which is nearby on Winchester Blvd.

Toward the south direction on Winchester Blvd there's Aldo's.

To the eastern direction there's the Pruneyard shopping area [Campbell's ""Tower of Sauron"" area] which has some good food places, for example Rock Bottom Brewery, Patxi's pizza which also does deep dish, and Orchard City Kitchen.

No robberies, violence, 2am barking dogs, break-ins, &c. You can leave your first-floor window open over night.

There is one guy at the old folk's home who likes to go outside for a smoke and cough up whatever lungs he has left about 3-4 times over a given 24hr period but you probably won't notice him too much on Adler Ave.

"I live there, and have since 2009.

It is very convenient for the reasons you mention [grocery, park].

It's also just a couple small blocks from a VTA transit hub [although lite rail is shut down due to the recent VTA rail yard shooting] but the buses are still running.

My  neighbors are nice. To be fair//honest//transparent, about 7 years ago I had one bad neighbor for a little while, but since they've gone I've had zero problems.

The park, John D Morgan Park to be specific, is sizable and enjoyable. If you have kids the city is currently renovating the playground area, but there is PLENTY of open grass area to run around in. It also has a baseball field [I'm not good with sizes, but think Little League so it's big enough but not huge].

Depending on where you’re working Communications Hill (both new and old sections) could be worth looking into. Houses have nice setups for roommates, usually 3.5 to 4 baths for 4 beds. Commute from new Comm Hill to Campbell is around 12 -14 min with traffic for reference.
87 is ok at most times, gets backed up in AM Northbound between Capital Expressway and 680 split. If you’re taking 87 downtown or taking 280 it clears up after that. Cant speak for all the way up to Palo Alto..

Changes were made and now only Social Security numbers of persons who have been deceased ten years or more are accessible on the site.

"I’m grateful to have known this special cat for many years. One of his biggest gifts to the community was probably the simple fact that he was a perfect reminder to stop and smell the roses (or stop and pet the kitty!). Out of concern for him, I always preferred that people appreciated him without touching him, but regardless, it was always so nice to see the impact that those interactions had on people. They’d literally stop what they were doing and would take a minute just to admire him (maybe they’d pet him or take a quick selfie with him) and without fail, everyone would would carry on a bit brighter, with a little extra spring in their step. He made countless people smile every day.

Oh no. This was my neighbor’s cat growing up that they left to the new owners of the house after moving. She was my friend for a while growing up. Super sad to hear this. She wondered into my backyard one time when I was messing with a steak knife and some cardboard boxes (as kids do lol) and I remember she tried to snuggle up to the knife and I had to push her away and hide the knife and I was like “no kitty cat knives are not for snuggling” or something like that. Then I called the number on her tag because I was worried she got out but they said she (or they might have said he could never remember lol) was an outdoor cat and liked to wonder.

"Also surprised they lasted that long. I used to live down the block from there (still live close by) and I'd stop by to wander around. Kinda gave up on buying stuff though.

I tried multiple times to give Fry's several hundred dollars when I bought a new desktop computer set-up. Spent a few hours comparing monitors there, but when I finally was ready to buy, they were out. Couldn't order more. Couldn't tell me when more would come. Had similar experiences with a few other products.

It's a shame, because Fry's has been a bit of an institution in my mind (those commercials always stuck with me) and there are so few places to buy electronics parts in person these days.",t2_1orlxg01,gnsoria,0,1605076486.0,0,t1_gbwvogi,gbwvogi,True,Rcaroman,t3_js2pin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Campbell/comments/js2pin/unfortunately_it_has_been_a_favorite_gadget/,Unfortunately it has been a favorite gadget window shopping place for many years.

"A while back I signed up for the USPS ""Informed Delivery"" service. I get the emails and txt messages, so I know a fair idea about what and when I should be expecting. Sometimes they misfire telling me I'm going to get something for my neighbor but it gets delivered correctly, other times they misfire not telling me and I get something for my neighbor, but most of the time I get what they tell me I'm getting. This is for both envelope and packages, the envelopes carrying the brunt of mis-information.

Recently there have been some delays in delivery to me, usually by 1 day. I'm one of those folks who still does Netflix by disc, so besides important mail + Informed Delivery yes I know when I should get something.

Last I heard, Campbell Post Office [main is on Hamilton, Annex is on Campbell Ave across from Psycho Donuts] was having problems before Trump swaggered in. So there might be compounded problems ""special to us"" in the writ large scheme of things.

Thankfully I live behind a shopping complex that still has a blue box. I use that when I can, like when I'm on my way to transit or grocery or something.

I do think they have the right to walk their dog on the trail. I never said they didn't have that right. I suggested that the creek trail may not be the safest environment to walk their dog, due to them being on a leash and their owners refusing to keep them to the right of the trail, and the hundreds of cyclists passing by them, with inches to spare.

"What I'm getting at, and what you failed to understand, is that people walk their dogs on the creek trail because THEY want to walk on the creek trail. THEY don't want to walk in the park, THEY don't want to walk in their neighborhood, THEY want to walk on the creek trail. 

So saying this ""But I understand, **the dogs are so demanding** and refuse to be walked in a park or just on the street in their neighborhood"" is a huge load of bullshit conflating two issues: Where the PERSON wants to walk and where a dog CAN walk. 

If YOU have the right to walk on the creek trail then THEY have the right to walk on the creek trail with or without their dogs. Just because THEY have dogs doesn't mean THEY need to be relegated to city sidewalks and parks since YOU apparently think the creek trail is only for cyclists and walkers without dogs. 

Ya jackass.

"I'm ok with dogs. But they don't know the concept of staying to the right on the narrow trail. I don't blame the dogs. I blame the owners who let their dog go to the left randomly, thus extending their leash ALL THE WAY ACROSS the paved bike path, blocking it off, and exposing their beloved animal to the danger of a cyclist colliding with the leash, and possibly breaking the neck of their loved dog. But I understand, that's way too difficult to comprehend.

>I understand, you're so demanding that you refuse to walk in the park or just on the street in your neighborhood.

Where the fuck did I say this? Beautiful reading comprehension you've got there. I own a dog, and take him to parks and I walk him around my neighborhood, where there AREN'T hundreds of cyclists passing-by within inches of me and the dog.

"Dude, no. 
They have not open for a reason. Yes the other farmers markets are open but Campbell was always the most PACKED one. 
If you can’t find the space for social distancing (and I am sure they did look through many many avenues) then why risk it? Campbell is already having issues with people not wearing masks when going outside, can you imagine how bad a packed farmers market will be? 

Go to a farm if during a pandemic Safeway or Whole Foods is not to your liking anymore. Farms are open by appointment. 

It’s mind-boggling seeing all the entitled people out there complaining about a farmers market not being open, wearing a mask, not being able to travel bla bla bla. EVERYONE IS IN THE SAME BOAT!

"Here's the super lame ""justification"" from the official budget documentation:

>The Campbell Police Department acquired a V150 armored rescue vehicle from the Department of Defense 1033 program in 1998. At the request of the Department of Defense the vehicle was returned on August 22, 2019 having reached the end of its service life. As a result, the Campbell Police Department has had to rely on other agencies in the County to provide armored rescue vehicles and personnel for the following needs and or potential needs: Ability to immediately support patrol incidents allowing officers to safely deploy to an area without exposing themselves to potential harm. Safety transport EMS personnel and conduct rescues during critical incidents involving the threat of gun fire to include active shooter scenarios. Provided more options and ability to deploy less lethal alternatives to safely resolve incidents. Safe environment to conduct field negotiations over a PA in proximity to the suspect. Support SWAT operations including but not limited to search warrant and arrest warrant service, barricaded subject(s) and hostage situations. Ability to breach doors and windows, deploy cameras and robots without exposing personnel to harm during SWAT operations. Not having an armored rescue vehicle does not allow officer to regularly train with the specialized vehicle requiring outside agencies to provide trained personnel to assist. The Lenco Bearcat would fill this need and is the same armored rescue vehicle used by other agencies in our County. This would also allow us to conduct joint training with other agencies and support each other’s operations with the same equipment each agency is trained on and familiar with. Once an order is placed, the average build and delivery time is 9 months.

Which reads very much like ""but mooooom, all the cool kids have one""

Incidentally, the same budget document lists this as the alternative to the purchase:

>Continue to rely on outside agencies to provide personnel and vehicle when available.

Which seems like a much better alternative.

I'm curious, how much do they charge you for internet?",t2_1gmmh35m,sandforce,0,1591590834.0,0,t1_ftc79u7,ftc79u7,False,sort_of_sleepy,t3_gyqwva,https://www.reddit.com/r/Campbell/comments/gyqwva/any_isp_recommendations/,Any ISP recommendations?,/r/Campbell/comments/gyqwva/any_isp_recommendations/ftc79u7/,1,r/Campbell,0,1
"I've had Comcast as an ISP for 16 years.  I'd say it is merely adequate and by no means is the connection reliable enough for me.  I'm on a 60mbit plan, but am considering upgrading, due to the additional network load caused by shelter-in-place.

However, if I could switch to another ISP that was more reliable, I'd do it (even for more money).

"Sadly yes. When we first moved in a year ago there was no property manager. The place was ran by the assistant manager  and she was fantastic (shout out to Tania). Everything was smooth, we the tenants we happy. 
About 6 months in, a new property manager was hired and she's rude, abrasive, and I would argue disrespectful towards the tenants. 
I can tell you that I personally have received at least 10 notes on my cars and door from her complaining about everything from having stuff on my patio (she told us that everything should be stored in the house, where am I supposed to keep our moving dolly?) to the fact that I didn't have the correct parking pass (she decided to reissue passes to everyone l, even those that already had a valid pass like me. She refused to take my registration because it said 2019, but only because my tags hadn't expired yet). To the fact that I couldn't have signs up in my window (she said my lease dictates that I can't have signs up. I looked at the lease, it did allow signs). She also threatened to tow my car if I parked in the visitors section one more time because I have a parking space. This was at a time when my wife was 8 months pregnant and it was easier for her to get in and out of the car from visitors parking (as it's much closer to our apartment than our actual parking spot is) when we needed to go to the doctor or the grocery store.

Lastly, our microwave died about a week ago. We out a work order in 5 days ago and haven't received any word on it. I emailed her to inquire and she said that due COVID 19, they are only doing emergency orders, and that next week they will start on orders in order that they came in FROM MARCH. I emailed her back and told her that we need the microwave to sterilize our newborns bottles and pacifiers, and that riverwalk should consider this an emergency.

"Long list. Let me start by saying what we loved about it. It was right across the street from a large park. We have 2 dogs so this was convenient and fun. That's the end of the pros. Now the cons. 

First, the layout of the apartment was poorly planned. The 1 bathroom was located in the master for a 2 bedroom apt. So I you had a guest or roommate, they would have to go through your room every time they had to access the toilet/shower/sink.
 Second, bugs. Silverfish, roaches, and earwigs were a common site. 
Third, rats. Big fat ones roamed the campus at night. Never saw one in the unit but one DID duck under the patio fence and make its getaway from me one night as I walked up. 
4th, parking. When we signed the papers they told us there was ample parking. Most nights after work  I had to park 2 to 3 blocks away. 
5th staff. Our freezer didn't have a shelf in it. We asked them to install a shelf and they told us this particular model did not come with a shelf. A quick Google search of the model fridge/freezer proved that yes indeed, there was supposed to be a shelf. We had to order it ourselves and have maintenance install it, and told them to deduct the price of the shelf from our rent.
6th. Neighbors. The upstairs neighbors had a Saint Bernard that they would leave in the patio for hours and the dog would bark LOUD at passers by, us, and when it wanted to go back inside. So this dog was barking basically all the time, day and night.

7th, something started growing out of the sink drain in the bathroom. We have a picture of it. Looked like a some sort of plant life, but wtf.

Luckily, they had a deal going on where if you weren't satisfied with your stay you could move out penalty free within the first 30 days. We lasted 21 days before we got the hell out of there. Yes, this all happened in just 21 days. 

8th. They tried to keep our deposit because they said there were ""strong pet odors"" in the apartment. Really? In 3 weeks? We shampooed the carpets ourselves and they tried to point to stains in the carpet that we documented as preexisting BEFORE we moved in during the walk through. They also lied about the timing of when the cleaners went in to clean the carpets and remove the non existent smells. We fought for 3 weeks but they finally gave us our full deposit back after we threatened to take them to court over it.

Sabrina was the property manager back then, she's the worst. 

She also lied to us about prices when we first inquired about the apartment.",t2_dan5j,Besonderein,0,1591212468.0,0,t1_fss2n47,fss2n47,False,djnush,t3_gdbtdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Campbell/comments/gdbtdb/looking_for_fun_apartment_complexes_in_campbell/,Looking for fun apartment complexes in Campbell,/r/Campbell/comments/gdbtdb/looking_for_fun_apartment_complexes_in_campbell/fss2n47/,1,r/Campbell,0,1
