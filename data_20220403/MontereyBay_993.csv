"I agree that the war on drugs is a joke, but I think providing them freely is a terrible idea. We should decriminalize drug use and provide a safe place to use, and a way to recover from addiction. This would free up money that is spent on law enforcement and prisons (prisons being a massive for profit business which is another topic altogether) for other social benefits that are desperately needed. 

I don’t know economics well enough to debate a $27 minimum wage, but I can say that at the very least there should be enough affordable housing available that unskilled workers should be able to live within easy public transit distance from their jobs.",t2_9usopb2j,montereyrealtor,0,1649005646.0,0,t1_i38s8g7,i38s8g7,False,rea1l1,t3_tv9nsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontereyBay/comments/tv9nsz/since_this_great_satire_from_the_mc_weekly_was/,"Since this great satire from the MC Weekly was removed by OP, let's take another look and have a healthy discussion...",/r/MontereyBay/comments/tv9nsz/since_this_great_satire_from_the_mc_weekly_was/i38s8g7/,1,r/MontereyBay,0,1

"Just like any group of people there are a mix of people who “want” to live like this. And by want I simply mean they don’t want the responsibility that is required to hold down a job and have a place to live. However, there are also plenty of homeless who would love to have the opportunity to hold down a job and have a home. 

I know someone who helps run i-Help. They were homeless for awhile, not because they didn’t have a job, or even because they couldn’t afford a rental, but they were constantly passed over for families with more than one income. 

The affordable housing situation in our area is dismal, and that’s being nice about it. There are people who simply don’t have the ability to get and keep a six figure job, and with 2 bedroom apartments going for $24k a year, even someone making $25/hr is going to be spending nearly half of their gross income on a place to live. How do you raise a family on that? And let’s say you have a couple making $25/hr each. With the cost of childcare around here it makes more sense for one to stay home than to pay for childcare, and we’re back to how do you raise a family on $52k a year? 

I agree that just handing money to people isn’t going to help. In some cases just giving people homes isn’t going to help, but if we could figure out a way to house somebody who wants to contribute to society, even if it’s only providing free housing for a short period of time, and then continue to provide affordable housing for unskilled labor, I think we would see our homeless population decrease drastically.",t2_9usopb2j,montereyrealtor,0,1649004510.0,0,t1_i38phth,i38phth,False,rea1l1,t3_tv9nsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontereyBay/comments/tv9nsz/since_this_great_satire_from_the_mc_weekly_was/,"Since this great satire from the MC Weekly was removed by OP, let's take another look and have a healthy discussion...",/r/MontereyBay/comments/tv9nsz/since_this_great_satire_from_the_mc_weekly_was/i38phth/,2,r/MontereyBay,0,2
"The homeless we notice out and about are hardly the tip of the ice berg. Most of the homeless population blends in, keeping themselves relatively clean, living in their car, working a job that doesn't pay a living wage. It's only when they're really down and out, often with severe mental illness, that we actually take notice of them. I know good people who grew up in multi million dollar families who went homeless because their parents have mental health disorders that produced an extremely unhealthy family home.

Those with severe mental illness need a mental health clinic, and that should absolutely be part of public policy and paid by taxes.

Those who don't want a job is a failure of market forces - they aren't provided sufficient financial incentive to hold one down. Why spend your life working for scraps only to hand it all over to those who already are financially well off via rent and business profit? That is wage slavery. Give them the $27 an hour starting wage, which is equivalent to the minimum wage when it was introduced when accounting for inflation and productivity increases. I bet plenty of those who don't want a job will all of a sudden be happy to work.

Drug use is hardly an issue worth confronting via the justice system. Every society in all of history is full of drug use. Many wealthy today certainly consume drugs. The war on drugs is only one in name, used instead as a weapon against the impoverished, to keep nonwhites poor, and to fuel the prison-industrial complex. If you want to help addicts the best things you can do is provide them a safe place to consume clean drugs in a medical environment early in the morning so that they can continue their day, with their fix provided, and move on to fulfilling their other basic needs. To addicts, a drug is but a much needed medicine that merely places a bullseye on their head. Demonizing drug users does nothing but make those who fall into addiction targets of the militarized ""justice"" system. This system simultaneously removes the black market incentive to sell and push drugs if they are provided freely no questions asked in safe environment.",t2_6tno4,rea1l1,0,1649004186.0,0,t1_i38opck,i38opck,False,rea1l1,t3_tv9nsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontereyBay/comments/tv9nsz/since_this_great_satire_from_the_mc_weekly_was/,"Since this great satire from the MC Weekly was removed by OP, let's take another look and have a healthy discussion...",/r/MontereyBay/comments/tv9nsz/since_this_great_satire_from_the_mc_weekly_was/i38opck/,2,r/MontereyBay,0,2

"The reason Andalucia and other coastal regions of European countries (that are similarly costed) is so cheap is because they are one of the poorest regions of Spain. I've spent a month in Andalucia, including in poorer cities like Almeria, and while the caba de Gato and other coastal regions (almost) hold a candle to Big Sur, the quality of life there is drastically lower compared to an area like the Monterey Peninsula. While everything is expensive here, there are a ton of incredible things to do for free. And on top of that, the schools and colleges and job opportunities my child will have access to just by living in America is a privilege many people in the world can only dream of. 

It's all subjective though.  I personally find much more fufillmrnt living in a place that enraptures me and fills me with wonder than I would living in a cheaper place inland that saves me a lot of money.

"My wife and I are a single income family with a child and we manage to make it work (renting a 2 bedroom) but we aren't able to save much if anything. Our income is around 6 figures a year, maybe a bit less. We have a 9 month old child as well. Our solution is living very ""house poor"". Very very rarely eat out/takeout, cook cheap and make the food last, don't buy things we don't need, don't have streaming subscriptions, try and keep lights off and heat not on unless needed. Our lifestyle would make a lot of Americans miserable but we are homebody types that just want to go hiking and spend time in nature or read so this city is like Mecca for us. 

Some people might think it's unwise to not live in a way that saves a ton of money, and honestly pre-covid we lived that way, but in the last few years it seems like any promise of a regular ""American dream"" life for anyone without inherited wealth seems like an impossibility, and we just want to make the most out of our lives before this country gets even more unstable or collapses even further into uncertainty. We do have a good retirement saved up, but beyond that we aren't expecting to ever see a cent from social security or any other programs by the time we get to that age (Mitt Romney was just talking about being in support of cutting younger peoples retirement benefits yesterday...if this is what America's future looks like, what's the point in obsessing over it).",t2_vvdsm5,Whitewaterking,0,1648839106.0,0,t1_i30ne74,i30ne74,True,fanzakh,t3_ttmoru,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontereyBay/comments/ttmoru/how_in_hell_do_you_guys_afford_to_live_here/,How in hell do you guys afford to live here?,/r/MontereyBay/comments/ttmoru/how_in_hell_do_you_guys_afford_to_live_here/i30ne74/,3,r/MontereyBay,0,3

"We have a child care crisis in California

As the [State of California has a historic budget surplus](https://ktla.com/news/california/california-to-have-31-billion-budget-surplus-next-year-analyst-predicts/), families in California are struggling to find affordable childcare.

[Last year 8500 child care centers closed in California. ](https://calmatters.org/children-and-youth/2021/03/child-care-centers-close/) Families that relied and budgeted for the 'affordable' daycare option have had some difficult decisions to make. Centers that stayed open reduced capacity to limit the spread of Covid-19. That means it's incredibly difficult to get space in a daycare center. If you're lucky enough to find an opening, you better have backup care or a lot of PTO because any sniffle, runny nose, or cough and they are sent home. (Or in our case, when our 2 year old bit another kid and was kicked out permanently.)

The other option is to hire a nanny. If you're lucky enough to find a nanny share, I'm told the starting rate for the bay area is around $15 an hour, which is nearly $40k a year. If you can't find a share, which is very possible, the starting nanny rate for one child in my area is $23 an hour. Some nannies give discounts if you hire them full time. But if you budgeted in 2019 for daycare, you likely didn't factor in a 30-40% year over year increase in child care costs.

I don't begrudge nannies (or any child care provider) wanting to make a fair wage, they deserve it. It's hard work (if you're good at it) and demand is high. It's just a matter of economics that some people aren't going to be able to pay that wage. At $23 an hour, you're paying around $50k a year when you factor in the payroll taxes (which you are legally and morally obligated to pay). So if someone's earning $70k a year or less and they can't find a group childcare situation, all (or more) of their take-home income is going to child care. Couples have to make a decision at that point whether the lower earning parent stays home with the kids. Even when the household income is a relatively high $150k, if one parent is only bringing home $70k, it starts to make more financial sense for the low earner to stay home with the kids if a daycare spot can't be found. People earning less have even more of a struggle as they weigh their few options.

Am I asking for sympathy for couples bringing in $150k a year? No. (Though while $150k is enough to live comfortably, it's not a lavish salary in the Bay area surrounded by tech billionaires.). But I am trying to explain the disappearance of people from the workforce to conservatives shouting about how 'nobody wants to work anymore!'. Those same conservatives are happy to give tax breaks to billionaires in the name of job creation but are unwilling to help working class families find child care so they can continue to apply their skills in the workforce.

We should also consider gender equality. Women are more likely to be the low earners in a relationship and thus stay home as care givers-even when they are skilled workers. They are leaving careers, promotion opportunities, and raises. They might leave the work force for good or face discrimination when they attempt to re-enter. If they stay in the work force they contribute their expertise, continue to pay taxes, stay on track for wage increases, and provide work for a child care provider. (Men may face the same obstacles if they leave the workforce to care for kids, which is a problem, too, but doesn't compound existing gender inequality.) They will pay more in taxes in the long term. Taxes spent on child care come back. Having broad access to child care facilities is good for the economy. 

This is what makes child care the perfect candidate for government support. It's high overhead and high importance. 

We need our leaders to work to increase the early childhood education centers. Streamline the permitting process for daycare buildings, have a liaison for daycares to help make sure a new daycare site is up to code, offer grants and interest free loans, remove fees for licensing. Clear obstacles for the opening of daycare centers so that people can get the help they need. Or better yet, have state funded daycares and preschools.

Edit: Lastly, OP, if you have a spare room in your house, consider an au pair. It's about $23k a year but you need to house them, pay for their food, and make sure they get cultural exposure while in America.",t2_lej7j8ia,cementship,0,1648824844.0,0,t1_i2zniwl,i2zniwl,True,fanzakh,t3_ttmoru,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontereyBay/comments/ttmoru/how_in_hell_do_you_guys_afford_to_live_here/,How in hell do you guys afford to live here?,/r/MontereyBay/comments/ttmoru/how_in_hell_do_you_guys_afford_to_live_here/i2zniwl/,3,r/MontereyBay,0,3

"I really did my homework on them before I rented a place from Mangold, and if you really dig in to the actual bad reviews, the people simply do not read their rental agreements.

I think the most common one was regarding their repaint: You do not pay for any repainting on move out IF you stay longer then 36 months, and the complaints were from people who clearly didn't read that and were turn and burning after a single year lease.

We've had zero issues in our first year with them.

We had a small electrical problem, they had a guy there the very same day.

We had a water heater issue, no questions asked, they replaced the water heater the very next day.

Snorkeling Monterey Bay sounds fantastic, and the pictures make it look like fun, but like other people have mentioned, it leaves out a number of factors that really should be made clear. I have dived in the bay and never seen it as clear as in those pictures. Usually it's about 5-10' visibility and brown water. The kelp is cool, and you see plenty of seals and sea lions and Garibaldi fish. It's not mexico or hawaii in terms of ocean life though. Right now the water is 53 degrees. [https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Lovers-Point/seatemp](https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Lovers-Point/seatemp) will keep you up to date on that. It requires a thick wetsuit, hood and booties. If you are down for that, great, but between that and the swell that is usually a factor, it's not a casual experience. I haven't gone for a long time because that cold gives me a headache, but I hope you can find someone at the dive shops who could take you.

Another really fun thing to do is paddleboard or kayak off Del Monte beach - Monterey Bay Kayaks has gear (wetsuits are a good idea for that too) and can set you up. Maybe they would know someone who can help with snorkeling too, so it might be worth calling them. Playing in the waves while launching and bringing the boards in is really fun .

"my son and wife and I go weekly to Lover's Point.  We have lot of extra gear, although depending maybe not a wetsuit.  Feel free to PM if you'd like to join us.

Also, while the coast waters CAN be treacherous, it isn't necessarily dangerous.

Very few places here are ""hidden dangers"".

Lovers' Point is very safe:  protected waters, shallow, accessible and visible dangers (well, rocks aren't dangerous but they should be swum around with awareness).  And, if you don't leave the immediate beach area it is even safer.

Look at online maps - you'll see how it is a very protected cove.  You can see almost as much within the cove as outside.  You'll see great wildlife:  Sea hares, starfish, urchin, seals, etc.

Mission Beach as an example in Carmel is probably the least safe:  not because it's inherently dangerous; but rather because the dangers are hidden (beach drops off precipitously steeply and has a notoriously strong current, most fatalities in the area are here).

Monterey Beach is probably about as safe as possible:  flat, minimal current, small waves.  However you won't see much except a passing seagull maybe and a few sand dollar beds ... although you probably won't recognize them without knowing :)

"Please do not randomly go snorkeling in Monterey Bay. As a local, I learned very early on about high tides (which could mean stronger, difficult to navigate waves) and the rip tide, which is usually visible by its dark, circular area in the water. Lovers Point does not have a lifeguard, as many of the beaches do not have one. People are advanced in the water, go out and still drown. Maybe this doesn’t apply to everyone. Maybe some of y’all are skilled. But i would never suggest freefall snorkeling to someone unfamiliar with the waters. This ain’t Hawaii lol

"In Salinas, I would head to Main Street.


There is a new sports bar called James Dean Sports Bar in the old 201 Main spot but I haven’t been to it - in fact, I don’t know if it’s open. Heard it’s got good decor and the burgers are good. 


Dubbers is right across street and will definitely have games on. It’s got decent food and a full bar. 


Farmers Union Pourhouse has 4 TVs and great beer and wine selection but no food. Cool setting but not what I would call a sports bar.


Kings Den is a dive bar on Alisal with a couple TVs. 


There’s a new brewery on Main by Maya Cinema but don’t know how that will be for a game. Went in for one beer two weeks ago and it was ok. 


There’s a couple other places down in old town but nothing I would suggest for a game.",t2_dx661,lastphemy,0,1648012485.0,0,t1_i1rdlxe,i1rdlxe,True,responsible_dave,t3_tkl644,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontereyBay/comments/tkl644/where_to_watch_basketball/,Where to watch basketball,/r/MontereyBay/comments/tkl644/where_to_watch_basketball/i1rdlxe/,8,r/MontereyBay,0,8

I figured why not do the brake pads too like a dumbass so that I don’t have to worry about it. Required repairs ended up being rotors and calipers at roughly 50k miles total on the car and I had to pick it up myself after declining their bull.
