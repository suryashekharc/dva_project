Hey if it makes you feel better I’ve been paying for a certain amount in NY and NJ and the story is the same as yours. More recently I’ve been paying $120 for just 100/10 speed (gotta love those east coast prices lol) and almost every time I test it the speed is under 20. 

I’m really surprise at the Suddenlink comments here. Reading online reviews it made me think they’re atrocious but I guess I should learn my lesson that people online are more whiny lol.

"Another person here with Suddenlink. I've had no trouble with them other than that I wanted to do port forwarding and their crappy modems don't support it (after being on a call with tech support for nearly 2 hours). Not a huge deal because I basically spent part of the $200 sign up Visa card they gave me on a Netgear C600 modem. It took 45 minutes on the phone with them to activate it... 

They accidentally removed a $10 sign up discount from my account when they removed the modem charge that was also $10, so my bill stayed the same at about ~$45 for the 400 Mbps only.

I've only seen the internet go out once in nearly a year and it was at like 10 PM and was back within a few minutes.

"I bought Suddenlink the weekend I moved here in 2017. I’ve had exactly one outage caused by SL. The rest were power outages and such which were out of SL’s control. 

I bought the 300mb package then and was moved to their 400 package a couple years ago because the 300 wasn’t offered. My payments haven’t changed at all since 2017 and I’ve had very few usage slow downs at peak times, (less then 5 total that I can remember). I have 2 teenagers and two of us game online, one lives on Snapchat and my wife works from home and we don’t have usage issues at all. 

I truly wouldn’t mind the gig myself but I haven’t needed it and the cost diff doesn’t offset my need. 

I will say buy your own modem/router if you can. They use Arris which aren’t bad per say but they’re the cheapest shit model they offer.

You can’t go to a school if it isn’t zoned for it.  Not sure if your kids are into music or tennis.. we did consider Round Rock for that reason.  Schools are slightly better from our research, but the landscape is very flat in Round rock.  Location wise, it is closer to I35.  We were warned of I35, and it reminded me of the Belt at times.  On the other side, (Leander/cedar park ), you have the 183/183a.  Also, lake Travis is closer from Cedar Park.  We’re been there a few times..  definitely worth going to check out.  From where we live, we can head downtown (40 minutes) if we need to get some fancier food options.  We’re cooking in most of the time these days anyway, so it doesn’t bother us.  The local supermarket chain is H‑E‑B.  It’s like paying shoprite prices for wholefood quality.  The way I see it, cedar park, Georgetown, Leander, round rock, phuegerville, are all good choices.  I would center in on the schools you think your kid will do well in.  Then use redfin to search for the neighborhood.  Then go from there",t2_31mgxs24,gogishing,0,1648474930.0,0,t1_i2fpxmh,i2fpxmh,False,socalccna,t3_s6jqbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/s6jqbz/possibly_making_the_move_whywhy_not_i_should_live/,Possibly making the move?

"We have 3 kids(5, 7, and 11y/o). We’re so confused about the unknown and don’t really wanna make the mistake to choose the wrong area. Leander and Cedar Park are on our radar, but again, it all depends on the job's location. So far, I’m in the process for a job in Georgetown, and tomorrow I’ll find out if I’m hired or not. I was told to stay away from I35, and focus more on the West in regards to the peak traffic. We’re not a party-goers, and always take our kids when we go out no matter the venue - a restaurant, mall, shopping, park, attractions, events, etc. We’ve been living by the ocean for years, and the water scenery is something I guess we will miss a lot in comparison to nature-lush NY, but definitely not the cold winters. I’ve been reading a lot lately about the tornado/flood phenomena in TX, particularly around the Austin area. Should we be afraid of it and how people are coping eventually with the property damage? Is it something that should really be aware about it before we move? What about the nasty species like mosquitoes, scorpions, etc.? I really don’t wanna see those in my toilet climbing my butt while anchoring the chain.

"- The school ratings depend on a lot of factors. But most people forget that relatively newer schools typically tend to have lower rating. For example Glenn or Danielson which opened after 2016, are ranked lower mainly because the data isn’t there for some parameters that determine the rating.

- Also, the school curriculum is set by the district, so the courses offered are pretty much the same in all the schools in the district. For example, I know a kid who goes to Rouse HS and they said Glenn and Rouse have the same courses. It could be that Rouse has more established teachers and staff, which somehow is more reassuring.

Edit: I realized I didn’t answer your question.

I'm a libertarian socialist so basically I live by the idea that everybody deserves to be free to do whatever they wish as long as it doesn't harm another person, but also am not a fan of big government as an institution, and think the government needs to represent ordinary people and understand the needs of the working and middle class instead of answering to their donors.

"Yes, there are flaws in our system that need addressed. And I generally believe that form-based codes, with some usage-based restrictions for public health and wellbeing, would be a better solution most of the time. I just don't think such a drastic change would have much support right now. So, in the meantime I would keep the proactive zoning, continue requiring developers to request variances, and then push for good form-based designs.

It's not great, but if we can get a few projects pushed through with good form-based designs that make them attractive to residents.

"Ultimately, use-based zoning's most significant failing is that it doesn't actually respond to realities on the ground in real-time. And so proactive zoning in a system like the one we have in Leander puts city leadership in the position of somehow presupposing where all of certain types of development ought to go. You might even get a few right by doing all of your deliberation through the lens of where infrastructure currently exists, but you wont get them all right.

The larger point I am trying to make here is that the *system* we use in Leander is flawed, or at minimum outmoded by better development practices that have grown technically in the past couple of decades (meaning modern non use-based zoning), and broadly speaking organically over the past couple of millennia.

A combination of the two. Proactive zoning should be used in locations that already have the infrastructure to support such developments.

"When I speak of business centers, I mean areas of the city that are developed to support diverse business interests. I want to see office/retail clusters that can support each other and use less physical space through things like shared parking lots/garages. With designs that are welcoming instead of cheap utilitarian monstrosities.

What we think of more as mixed use, with office, retail, and residential together is not out of the question, but it is not well supported by our 2020 comprehensive plan. So, any developer looking to propose such a design has an uphill battle on their hands.

About large businesses. Luring large businesses is a double-edged sword and there is a very real risk of making a deal with tax incentives or grants that may or may not pay out in the long run. The benefit of a relatively quick buildup and some capacity guarantees is great. But if they are displacing locals instead of employing them, or eating up water, or driving up commuter/commercial traffic, or just in general taking advantage of our community then I don't want them here.

">Our zoning code seems to say, or at least imply that we are supposed to have middle density transitionary zones between high- and low-density areas. But where are they, where are the blocks around downtown with English style row houses, or terraced mixed-use designs. Where are the Italian and Spanish courtyard blocks with three story walk ups or apartments and a tree covered public park in the middle. Where are the brownstones and cottages and organic apartment designs that remind us of caliche rock layers expose on the side of a hill. Where are the homes for stay at home workers that don't need parking because they ride a bike to the closest shopping center for meals out and order their groceries to be delivered.  
>  
>And this lack of transitionary design is one of the main factors that gets in the way of high-density development because no one, and I am sure I have some unhappy neighbors in North Creek over this, wants an apartment building right behind their house tall enough to remove any expectation of privacy in their own backyard.  
>  
>And the lack of high-density leads to a lack of affordability.

Natural transition of housing typologies is very difficult to accomplish via coding. Conversely the market (in Central Texas – and there is a lot of nuance to this caveat I wont get into here) will not readily provide untested typologies.  I'd argue the smarter move is to discourage low density detached housing in some/many of these areas via coding and simply make the barrier to entry as low as possible for missing middle housing. Making it a lot easier for small, preferably local developers to fill the middle of housing demand would be a very forward thinking move for Leander.",t2_ebdpg,marshallh,0,1645723256.0,0,t1_hy9jmf0,hy9jmf0,False,trey4leander,t3_sudlwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/,"My name is Trey, and I am running to be your representative for Leander City Council, Place 1",/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/hy9jmf0/,1,r/Leander,0,1

"I am independent. I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans over the years depending on if I felt the motivations behind a candidate were in the best interest of the constituency they want to represent.

And I hate to sound wishy washy, but my business experience, and my experience as a parent, make me lean fiscally conservative, and socially progressive.

Fiscally, I don't want to spend money I don't need to. But if I have to spend money and spending an extra 50% means I am saving twice as much by not having to update or replace things frequently then I will spend the extra money. This is how I feel about BCRUA, we have thrown good money down holes for years that only staved off the situation we are in now. BCRUA is a long-term solution that will lower risk and give us more options moving forward. Based on current usage and water table history, we will probably need municipal water reclamation plant within a decade or two. And BCRUA will make it easier and cheaper to bring these kinds of plants online when the time comes.

Socially, I support people's right to live the lives that make them happy and healthy. I feel we have a responsibility, as a community, to protect the health and safety of everyone equally. And I support everyone's right to be represented in civil discourse.

I think my grandfather said it best when he told me ""We are Texans first. And we are Texans more than we are anything else. And Texans look out for Texans no matter what.""

"My kids went to Pleasant Hill Elementary about a decade ago and it was bad then. Now I avoid that intersection whenever I can. In this instance, the problem is really the placement of the school. Other elementary schools build around the same time or later have typically been built in the middle of residential neighborhoods. This lets, for good and bad, traffic wind through streets that are generally empty, at least in the afternoons for pickup. PHE's location at a prominent intersection, without walking access from two of the school creates a bottleneck.

I think the first solution we should look at is improving pedestrian access to the school.

1. On the south side of the school, meandering through Highland Park and Blockhouse are green belts that would be great for adding low-cost pedestrian walking paths.
2. For major traffic thoroughfares, such as across Crystal Falls, or where my suggested pedestrian paths cross Blockhouse Drive, we should consider pedestrian bridges.
3. And we need to partner with the school district and the police to get better training for crossing guards for traffic management. Not waiting until a sufficient number of pedestrians has queued up and stopping traffic to often has a huge effect on actual and perceived traffic problems in the area. With a little better training, and the city's support, crossing guards could be part of the solution instead of a source of frustration.

As for other bottlenecks in the city, they need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Some issues simply need parking restrictions to open up flow, some need dedicated ingress/egress lanes for accessing private property, and some need speed limit adjustment, or flat-out road improvements.

On the discussion of planning. I agree that we are fairly short sighted. It seems like P&Z and the council are more concerned with ascetics and if a project technically meets all zoning requirements, then the impact it will have on traffic.

This is in part due to our budget issues and the need for constant growth to fill our coffers. And it has a lot to do with how neighbors to projects often perceive a plan as improving or damaging their property value. So, path of least resistance through the system is to check all the zoning boxes and provide a good-looking design that won't infuriate the neighbors.

"1, 2, & 3> Strong, responsible, business development. Almost all other issue stem from resource limitations brought about by our primarily residential tax base. With well-designed projects to attract low resource industries, we can grow our tax base in a way that will support infrastructure improvements, reduce citizens share of community service costs, and expand programs that enrich the community.

And businesses don't have to be giant eyesores, two of my favorite small towns outside of Texas are beautiful well manage cities that limit office heights to four stories and require designs that blend in or take advantage of the natural terrain. This leads to natural architectural designs, with built in/hidden parking garages, walkable park like spaces, and other features that make living and working in the town feel welcoming and engaging.

4 > Community building and public safety improvements. The us vs. them mentality that has grown more binary over the last 5-6 years is toxic and it puts a strain on our law enforcement. Law enforcement that is statistically understaffed anyway. This lopsided supply and demand for police time means that they don't have time to respond to some requests. I fear this has led to leadership that outright dismisses non-life-threatening complaints, and it emboldens certain segments of the community to act with impunity to make threats or take actions that do not belong in a civil society.

Fighting this trend will take efforts from multiple directions. First the administrative departments, like parks and rec, the library, and even the council will need to improve community outreach and find ways to open dialogs between groups. Like maybe using the council room to have more casual town hall discussions about current/topical issues in conjunction with festivals and events downtown. Unlike public comments during meeting this would give the community a chance to have dialogs that can clear up misconceptions and possibly change minds. And if we can improve our budget situation, we need to provide the police department with more staff. But maybe with some caveats to hire one or more specialists to deal with certain complaints that patrol officers are not traditionally equipped to handle, such as evaluating risk of harm from threats to citizens.

5> Affordable and efficient housing, with walkable/bikeable access to basic conveniences. Look not everyone wants to live in a single-family home on an eighth of acre a mile or more from the nearest store. Some don't want the cost, some don't want the maintenance, some want the sense of community that other neighborhood designs foster. But we seem to have only two modes. Single-family, and boxy, cheap looking apartment. There are some townhome style developments but those are few and far between.

Our zoning code seems to say, or at least imply that we are supposed to have middle density transitionary zones between high- and low-density areas. But where are they, where are the blocks around downtown with English style row houses, or terraced mixed-use designs. Where are the Italian and Spanish courtyard blocks with three story walk ups or apartments and a tree covered public park in the middle. Where are the brownstones and cottages and organic apartment designs that remind us of caliche rock layers expose on the side of a hill. Where are the homes for stay at home workers that don't need parking because they ride a bike to the closest shopping center for meals out and order their groceries to be delivered.

And this lack of transitionary design is one of the main factors that gets in the way of high-density development because no one, and I am sure I have some unhappy neighbors in North Creek over this, wants an apartment building right behind their house tall enough to remove any expectation of privacy in their own backyard.

And the lack of high-density leads to a lack of affordability.",t2_ji8yrdty,trey4leander,0,1645256234.0,0,t1_hxjy1il,hxjy1il,False,trey4leander,t3_sudlwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/,"My name is Trey, and I am running to be your representative for Leander City Council, Place 1",/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/hxjy1il/,2,r/Leander,0,2

"This is a tough question, so thank you for asking. First, I don't think it is the council's place to say who should or shouldn't be allowed to hold events. I would encourage the city council to set event guidelines that are fair and equitable to everyone, enshrine them is the city charter, and stick to them. And I would support any group that submits an event plan that isn't promoting violence, discrimination, or illegal activity. I want events to celebrate what makes us different and let us learn about our neighbors. And as much as I might not agree with someone, as long as they aren't a threat and don't try to take someone else's rights away I say let them participate. 

Now let me use my dad voice for a moment. Sometimes winning battles won't win you the war. Sometimes you need to sway the people rather than waste effort on the oppressor. For example, I think drag queen story time might have been better run as a ""private"", but open to all accepting participants, event for a few sessions, then maybe public performances, say at the park next to the city office because it isn't filled with kids unless parents \_want\_ to bring them to an event, a few times until average citizens became accustomed to it. Then schedule with the library. I think the reaction was because it was new and so it was ""invading"" in the eyes of some people. But it is harder for people to fight against something they don't understand when there is local history showing that it isn't a threat.

Here are some ideas if majority groups try to monopolize sites and times the city can make available. 1> escalating permit fees, like doubling the permit fee for every subsequent event making it fiscally impractical to hold lots of events per year.  And passing those fees directly back to the departments that can expand the available locations and times making it impossible for any single group to lock out other groups. 2> implement a weighted lottery system where groups that haven't run events are given a better chance to be selected. 3>  Enforce buffer zones between permitted events and unpermitted protests. It's alright if the group that is holding an event wants to welcome individuals from the opposition to have a dialog, but it isn't ok for uncontrolled mobs, of any predilection, to make law abiding citizens fearful of their community. 

On a more lighthearted note, I absolutely agree about less chain restaurants. I have been fantasizing for years about opening a good chili place in town with cold beer on tap and a little stage in the back that plays alternative/punk rock a night or two a week. But the cost, and associated risk, always seem a little too far out for me.

Why the name “JewBoy”?

A good brand is going to be a perfect balance of emotional and rational thinking. It should be something that’s memorable and engaging, but also have relevance and be honest and not contrived. Growing up in El Paso, Texas, a primarily Hispanic community in a traditional Jewish home gave me a somewhat unique perspective. I guess I was insulated from the stereotypes of one culture and overexposed to the stereotypes of another. A common colloquialism among my friends was to refer to each other as “homeboys.” When they found out I was Jewish, I simply became “JewBoy.” It was never derogatory or mean spirited, in fact, looking back on it, I guess I owned it and it came to define me.

"That is a very vague and open ended question. Short answer, in general no. Most of our roads have appropriate speed limits.

Longer answer. On a case-by-case basis I would be open to reevaluating speed limits and why they are set the way they are. I would like to see more consistency, and limits set to encourage optimal traffic patterns. For example, 2243 between 183 and 183A is a 55mph zone, that dumps into a 40 between blocks. I would rather see it lowered to a 45mph zone through that section and see Hero way, a much straighter road with better visibility, be raised to a 50mph zone (as it is west of Bagdad Rd.) to encourage traffic to take the larger corridor. But that also leads into problems we have with zoning, and why we don't require large scale developers to pay for dedicated ingress and egress lanes for large developments that would help drivers slow down or speed up without interrupting the flow of traffic.

Ultimately it is a balancing act between public safety, route optimization, and inconvenience. And if you are looking for an Autobahn through the middle of town it just isn't going to happen.

"I really wanted to just ignore this question, but I need to defend a stance here that I think applies to all candidates running for public office.

My personal account contains sensitive info about friends and family, snarky comments about hobbies and other interests, and stories about my parents and grandparents that are appropriate for anonymized forums but not relevant to my aspirations to support our city. I do my best not to be dishonest or attack others, but sometimes there are disagreements in fact or opinions. That being said, if I am wrong, I will often post an admission as such and leave it up. Because there is value in seeing people acknowledge their mistakes.

I would not expect my opponent or anyone else running for office to expose details from accounts where they expect some level of privacy.

And for the record I know of at least one public servant in our city that has an account I am aware of, and a private account I know exists but am not privy to connecting with the individual. This doesn't make the person any less capable but does give them an outlet to talk about random things that effect their personal lives without taking focus away from the city.

"Let me reply to myself with a little clarification and elaboration.

I am not saying what anyone is doing now is a scam or that anyone is being dishonest. Simply that modern cities and towns all across the country fall into the same trap.

New residential construction is great for short term growth. It brings in revenue through permit fees and sales tax, and (at least for the first 5+- years) cost the city almost nothing in maintenance. This is pure gravy on our books, and it helps offset the maintenance cost of older areas of town that don't bring in enough tax revenue to cover their own costs.

Neighborhoods then leave the honeymoon phase and start incurring their own maintenance costs. For several years, or even a few decades, sales tax revenue from home turnover and property tax are good enough to cover the growing maintenance costs, but eventually average out to a net zero.

Leading at last to the sunset phase, where turnover slows because homeowners with unstable situations are replaced with more stable owners or get turned into rental properties which do generate property tax, but the sales tax from turnover mostly dries up. The good news is that these owners probably have more disposable income to be used on local goods and services, but without compelling local services those tax dollars are travelling to Cedar Park (lots of retail) or Austin (lots of entertainment).

We can only keep this cycle up for so long because our land area is finite, but if we start developing business centers to raise our tax base and start to transition to a more economically diverse city, we can safely avoid the post expansion stagnation that we are likely to suffer with our current model.",t2_ji8yrdty,trey4leander,0,1645111741.0,0,t1_hxbgag1,hxbgag1,False,trey4leander,t3_sudlwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/,"My name is Trey, and I am running to be your representative for Leander City Council, Place 1",/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/hxbgag1/,5,r/Leander,0,5

"On the ISP issue. And, by the way, I have over 30 years of IT experience, some of which was spent working for a cable internet provider as a network engineer.

I would love to see someone start up a not for profit, or for public benefit, competitor using the Google Fiber shallow last mile design.

"Here is the thing, for the next three to four years we would not get that money back. CapMetro would continue to receive exit payments directly from our tax revenue without providing any services. On top of that we would be required to provide services to replace some of what CapMetro provides now. So, we will be spending more money over the next few years to provide lesser services and it will probably take us a decade to recover.

Because of this I am not personally in favor of parting ways with CapMetro at the moment. But I am not, yet, on the council, and last year's exiting majority decided to hand this issue to residents for a vote just before departing. Our current council did the best they could to find a better solution, but ultimately had to give into pressure to put this on the ballot. I am standing up to say this is a bad situation and I am willing to take my lumps and try to make it better regardless of what the voters decide.

To answer your question more directly. If we separate, the plan is to scrape by until we recover from the exit shock. We might try to find alternatives such as partnerships with private transit providers, but an exit will absolutely mean _LESS_ money in the general fund over the next few years, and no option to leverage the train to bring money into the city. And that means the council will have to make hard decisions about where else we can reduce costs.",t2_ji8yrdty,trey4leander,0,1645083044.0,0,t1_hxa5lt6,hxa5lt6,False,trey4leander,t3_sudlwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/,"My name is Trey, and I am running to be your representative for Leander City Council, Place 1",/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/hxa5lt6/,4,r/Leander,0,4
"The debt we are carrying is a culmination of many factors. Decades of previous mayors and council members putting off needed action until we had no choice. Such as our water problem which probably could have been better planned for with a little belt tightening and forethought 30 years ago. And a lack of tax base improvements. Our reluctance to become a ""big"" city with all of the large businesses and services needed has put us in kind of a Ponzi scheme situation. We are relying on the immediate tax revenue brough in by new residential projects going to cover for our current sprawling and aging infrastructure.

There are two functional ways to stave off an inevitable collapse. Either reduce spending and raise services rates or taxes. Or start courting developers that want to build offices, entertainment, and hospitality that can pull tax revenues into town.

While I am not a fan of what we are spending on CapMetro. If we separate, we have to cover services and pay our exit payments (28M-42M over three to four years) and that will probably take us a decade or more to recover from. What would make more fiscal sense would be to stick with CapMetro, for this cycle, and focus on the northline development, and expanding downtown, as destination locations. I see northline as the hip/trendy development with mostly nationally recognized chains. But I would like to see downtown become our casual entertainment district with half a dozen small live music venues, casual (locally owned) restaurants, and kitschy shopping that people would enjoy just wandering around for an afternoon. I am not talking about our version of dirty sixth, more like downtown Georgetown or even Fredericksberg.

And that leaves us business developments, it is important to stop trying to bring in wasteful, resource intense businesses such as manufacturing and focus on building out an office corridor either around Ronald Reagan or 183A.",t2_ji8yrdty,trey4leander,0,1645082037.0,0,t1_hxa49r6,hxa49r6,False,trey4leander,t3_sudlwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/,"My name is Trey, and I am running to be your representative for Leander City Council, Place 1",/r/Leander/comments/sudlwj/my_name_is_trey_and_i_am_running_to_be_your/hxa49r6/,7,r/Leander,0,7
"On water waste. For the deveopment side, incentivizing builders to submit more detailed water management plans early on and letting us work with them to find solutions to lower water usage for their project could include things like grants or priority queuing for permits and plan review. For example, a new apartment complex could be incentivized, or required, to provide a designated car washing bay that captures and filters water for reuse, much like a commercial car wash does, to avoid wasteful runoff. Similar filtering could be done with laundry facilities.

For existing businesses or commercial spaces rebates on sales tax might be appropriate for waste remediation, or penalties for overt waste. I am sure we have all seen plenty of businesses desperately trying to keep a useless (that is it is nowhere anyone can safely use it for anything) green during the summer and asking ourselves why. We can offer assistance to replace or redesign such spaces using native plants or artificial turf to reduce that usage. Honestly, artificial turf has gotten incredibly good over the last couple of decades.

On the residential side we have some of the biggest problems, mainly our love affair, or our HOAs love affair, with our lawns.  We should be working with local landscapers and nurseries to advertise alternatives, pass ordinances that limit water hungry grasses, and organize workshops through parks and rec to teach people how to create beautiful landscapes with native plants. Who knows, maybe an annual contest with a $1000 prize for the yard voted most beautiful xeriscaped in Leander might motivate some people to change their focus and give it a try.

All of this is a cost benefit analysis conversation. If it cost the city say X to provide a gallon of water to a user, there is no reason why we couldn't divert some amount less than or equal to X to programs such as grants, rebates, advertising, etc. per gallon of water saved. Development and commercial projects are easier calculate estimated saving on new build outs.

"That's a fair question. They gray pipes in your first pictures are filled with natural gas which would become a liquid before freezing which happens at around -300 degrees and you would have other issues way before then like global catastrophe.

The other pipes look like they are in a protected area so it's not usually necessary to insulate but you certainly can and should if they are exposed to the elements.

"With the astronomical growth of Leander in the 6 short years I've been a homeowner, I don't understand the CapMetro funding being ANY percentage of taxes.  It is very clear that they are receiving a lot more money than they require to maintain service for us citizens.  This isn't a matter of exit, this is a matter of negotiating a sustainable static funding that better meets the ridership demand.  This is also an unfair time to discuss exit (without renegotiating a static funding) with Covid driving ridership to such low numbers.

"When I say a ""Good deal"" I don't mean a reduced payment. I mean services in parity with what we are paying. The state may specify what we have to contribute, but I would hope that contract law would be the mechanism to make sure we are getting value for that contribution.

We should have been fighting for extended train hours for over a decade, and we should have been fighting for a method/policy for requests made at a city level that we identify that will be evaluated and responded to officially.

I have stated before that extending train service would have public safety and economic growth benefits, so I won't go into that. But as someone that has been contacting CapMetro every few weeks (submitting complaints via 311 and directly via their website and email) since Hero way was opened up between 183 and 183A requesting they shift routes 985 and 987 away from the 55mph, 2 lane zone on 2243 (so they stop impeding traffic - Texas Penal code 454.363) to the 45mph, 4 lane zone on Hero way it is clear that they simply ignore individual complaints. So a procedure that would allow residents to complain to the city and let the city request reasonable adjustments with the expectation of at least official review and response that can be shared with residents so we know why our requests are being denied.

The backup option that Christine posted links to seems to be CapMetro admitting we are not being provided a level of service appropriate to our contributions, apparent by both their suggestion of greater transparency and their plan to put overpayments into a fund for improvements. But it does nothing to remediate the theft of our overpayments for the last 40 years.

And yes, if we pull out we will pay that off in 3 years, because we don't get a choice in how we pay that back, it just continues to get drawn from our sales tax. But we still legally have to provide some services for residents, specifically the disabled and elderly, and we _want_ to keep the train and express bus, so we will have to pay for those on top of the tax base contribution CapMetro is guaranteed as our exit penalty. So if we pull out it will likely cost us more for at least 3 years, and that will take away budget from other programs we _need_.",t2_3z7d8,punknubbins,0,1643645123.0,0,t1_hv09v0j,hv09v0j,False,Vandjack,t3_se2zta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/se2zta/leander_voters_will_vote_may_7_on_whether_to_stay/,Leander voters will vote May 7 on whether to stay or exit Cap Metro + History of Cap Metro relationship,/r/Leander/comments/se2zta/leander_voters_will_vote_may_7_on_whether_to_stay/hv09v0j/,3,r/Leander,0,3

"We did do that.  There's only so much they can do to stay within the Texas Transportation Code, so there isn't a ton of wiggle room.  Our Pro Tem has been tremendous in getting CapMetro to create an interlocal agreement that is \*some\* help, but it stops short of being a perfect fix.  

[Here's what they came up with](https://capmetrotx.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5389782&GUID=B60E699A-F46D-468B-95D8-1861FCBEF1AD).  Think of this as the best backup option in the event we stay as a partner city.  Here are the points:

**Ensure the cost of service to Leander is fully transparent and calculations are verified for the purpose of the Interlocal Agreement.** \- Our staff has reached out in the past asking for costs of service and it's been.....difficult.  

**Ensure enhanced coordination with the City of Leander on the federally required service planning process prior to bringing service changes to the Board of Directors for consideration and approval.** \- We currently have zero say.  Zero.  I firmly believe we know our residents better than CapMetro does, but we aren't contacted to work on routes.  We're completely at their mercy.  They did let us sit with them 2 years ago to help define the area for the Pickup service.  I'm not kidding you, in the fastest growing city in America, they brought a 3-year old map.  \*facepalm\*  We need to have a say.  This particular wording isn't great, but it gives us something.

**In accordance with Capital Metro Board Resolution (AI-2022-318), include a $10 million transit supportive infrastructure fund in a FY2022 Budget Amendment for consideration and approval in March 2022 to fund transit supportive infrastructure projects proposed by small city members. Funding for the program is to be allocated proportionately to each small member city by sales tax contribution. Staff shall seek input from the City of Leander and the small member cities in developing additional program parameters.** \- Fantastic start, but there are 6 member cities and they're all eligible.  

**Coordinate with the City of Leander staff to enhance our comprehensive service planning and community outreach methods to ensure City residents are aware of Capital Metro services and opportunities.**  \- Fabulous but it shouldn't take an agreement to make happen what should have been standard operating procedure for the last 35 years.

**As Capital Metro finalizes its Facilities Master Plan, if real estate holdings are identified in Leander as available for non-Capital Metro facility purposes, Capital Metro will coordinate with the City of Leander for the best use of the real estate to meet both entity’s goals.** \- There is a real estate holding.  We've asked about it for well over a year.  They say they don't have a use for it and are willing to sell, but continue to tell us longer and longer times until they're going to be ready.  

The thing is, there is literally no better deal.  The state law keeps us from doing anything more than this.  And the reason why things like the infrastructure fund are available to all the member cities is because whatever they offer to us they have to offer to everyone.  

Yes, there is a penalty for exiting, to be paid back out of the sales tax they would have received anyway over about 3 years.

"Hey there.  I can't reply via city email because it constitutes using a city resource for campaign information.  My social media accounts however are not endorsed by the city so I can speak a little more freely here. 

So we've got the numbers on what it would cost us to run our own replicated service.  Rail is crazy expensive, more than $2,000 per trip.  We also know from the ridership historically that it's utilized much less than the rapid bus (which essentially provides the same service). 

If we continue with rail, it would be incumbent upon CapMetro to work out a contract with us.  That may or may not happen.  For bus service though, including rapid bus routes, we could replicate that if CapMetro doesn't want to contract.  Other cities (\*Round Rock\*) already do this so we aren't entirely reinventing the wheel. 

What you'll see in the coming weeks are reports from our staff outlining specifics about our service options so we can begin to prepare in case the voters do decide to exit.  

It's important to note that the tracks aren't going anywhere.  There is nothing that stops the city from rejoining CapMetro in the future when the state fixes the funding, or we can just better financially afford it.  I've seen lots of comments about us  basing this on pandemic ridership - that's inaccurate.  Pre-pandemic we were getting ridership numbers from CapMetro and they were incredibly low then as well.  The only time historically the train has been wildly successful has been when gas prices spiked.  Short of that, bus service was the winner.",t2_8hdzyzvn,HeyItsChristine,0,1643416776.0,0,t1_hunpnvd,hunpnvd,False,Vandjack,t3_se2zta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/se2zta/leander_voters_will_vote_may_7_on_whether_to_stay/,Leander voters will vote May 7 on whether to stay or exit Cap Metro + History of Cap Metro relationship,/r/Leander/comments/se2zta/leander_voters_will_vote_may_7_on_whether_to_stay/hunpnvd/,3,r/Leander,0,3

"Great point, but I'm wondering if they are thinking of temporarily dropping rail since the demand has dropped tremendously since the pandemic started. u/Jonesmark has a point that they have not specifically stated they would keep the rail, but they also haven't said they wouldn't. The 10M annually for the contracted rail service is an estimate, but with the total cost being 10M right now, surely they aren't thinking of saving a couple of million to 7.9M by going contract and that means dropping rail. Otherwise, that's incredibly dumb. 

But I have to think they are looking at information that shows they could get the same service as now but cheaper through a contract instead of through the current deal. The mayor said ""I have this study now that tells me exactly how to replicate the existing service and expand it for less cost and still have money leftover for investing in our community.""

"To be clear, I don’t want to give up the train. I ride the train a lot relative to most. My point is that the way this is reported, and the way you’re presenting it, is a false dichotomy.

Leaving Cap Metro allows Leander to contract directly for the services we want from them as opposed to being beholden to their whims. I’m still undecided which way I’ll vote in May. It all depends on how negotiations go until then.

Edit: Our conversation sent me down a deeper rabbit hole of research. I need to correct this post. I was wrong and the train does not stop in Cedar Park.

The assumption that we’re overpaying 1.7-2M/year is based on flat tax growth or that ridership will increase at the same rate as taxes. And I don’t think either of those is going to be the case.

"Edit: This conversation sent me down a deeper rabbit hole of research. I need to correct this post. I was wrong in assuming the city could contract for MetroRail to operate in our city for less. I was using the example of Cedar Park who left Cap Metro in 1998 for reference. The train however **does not stop in Cedar Park**. The Lakeline station is just outside CP city limits and [the study commissioned by the city](https://destinyhosted.com/leanddocs/2021/CC/20211216_445/3265_TGC_Transit-Demand-Analysis_2021_Final.pdf) says it would cost $10MM a year for Leander to have the rail if we leave. That's a deciding factor for me. The rail is worth the extra cost in my opinion, especially as the network continues to grow through Project Connect. I'll be voting against breaking the agreement with Cap Metro. 

~~There was a study funded by the city that came to the conclusion that Leander is paying significantly more for its service than other similar cities. Are you proposing we ignore that because 30 years ago people voted yes?What proportion of the current city do you think lived here 30 years ago?~~

"Cmon, look at her own comment. 

&#x200B;

>Personally, I'm not looking at this as ""screw the train, we're out and taking these money bags"". What I'm looking at is an inadequate water infrastructure, a police department that has outgrown their facility, and a demand for parks and services that the city can't afford. And I look over here at CapMetro, and the gobs of money they receive every year and the continued lack of interest they display in our community and our needs. I have this study now that tells me exactly how to replicate the existing service and expand it for less cost and still have money leftover for investing in our community. Not to mention that the majority of our current investment is benefitting people who don't even live in the Leander city limits, who aren't affected by our water issues or lack of funding for services.

I never said that leander is going to decay into some dump without the train. All I said was it improved the property value of the homes surrounding it. Which I find hard to argue against, its the reason why I chose to build a home in Leander. An argument could be made for its usage is the population size. Leander is growing rapidly, I can see it having more use with more people.

"Leander spends so much subsidizing rides. Subsidized, it costs the city $214 dollars for each trip, up from $45 before the pandemic. Half of the city collected taxes goes directly to cap metro to the tune of about 10 million a year and go up as people move there. I think CM needs to work with Leander on the tax rate. It made sense at the beginning when it was smaller. With the pandemic and the move to WFH it's not expected to get above 75% of what it was before on ridership. Leander needs public transportation but if Austin makes it prohibitively expensive, maybe Leander should move to CARTS like a lot of area cities around the area are part of like New Braunfels which has a population of about 80k vs Leander at 54k. I hope it works out. Unless the council puts up something that will work shortly after the vote I would vote to stay. The kicker, if you decide to vote, is that if Leander leaves, the service immediately stops. The taxes will still be collected for the nonservice for over 3 years because there is a penalty clause for leaving to the tune of 33 million dollars. Leander will be giving that money to Austin to do absolutely nothing. Not quite sure how the council plans to pull off public transportation for those years they are paying. Your sales tax gives 1% to CM and 1% to the city. The city just reduced property taxes so enjoy it while you can if they vote to leave. I don't see how they can manage to do it without raising property tax. They can't raise sales tax because Texas caps what cities can add and it's there at 8.25 percent.",t2_aq1gk0h1,AgentAlinaPark,0,1643294251.0,0,t1_hufycdr,hufycdr,True,TreatyToke,t3_sdmytu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/sdmytu/cap_metro_headed_to_a_vote_yall/,Cap Metro headed to a vote y'all!!,/r/Leander/comments/sdmytu/cap_metro_headed_to_a_vote_yall/hufycdr/,2,r/Leander,0,2

"Here’s what he had to say recently in a comment he made on a post on Parents of LISD on FB. 

“I look forward to running for LISD Board of Trustees in November.  I appreciated this  past meeting when Aaron Johnson made the effort to speak about the pornographic books in our district classrooms.  I look forward to being an additional voice of reason, along with Aaron and hope we have several other conservative voices added to the Board in that election.

One of the main responsibilities of our Board of Trustees is to oversee our Superintendent.  I don't see that happening in any of our Board meetings and hope to change that.  I want to help bring the focus of our school district back to educating our kids and move away from the social indoctrination that has caused many parents to look  for other places to educate their kids.  In the past, LISD was a shining example of a great school district and I want us to return to being a district that parents can be proud of. 

It is time to stop allowing kids to have sex on our campuses and it is time to stop allowing kids to bully and beat up on other kids.  LISD did not used to be this way.  It is time to bring safety back to our school district.”

And

“I do not support allowing boys into girls bathrooms.  Just because a boy wants to wear a dress does not mean he should be able to stand at a toilet in a girls bathroom and urinate there.  Nor should he be allowed to hang his genitalia out in front of little girls.  Nor should teachers be forced to incorrectly use pronouns by calling a boy a girl or by calling a girl a boy.  

If teachers are not allowed to teach basic grammar to children then our educational system has become useless.

"I can’t figure out how to post an image here. I’ll give you his text instead.   Apparently bulls like sermons. 



“I’ve often wondered what it would be like to listen to Jesus preaching to multitudes of people in the open air.  On the day when Simon Peter first met Him, the multitudes were pressing in around Jesus and it made it difficult for Him to speak with a voice that would reach those in the back.  So Jesus got into Simon’s fishing boat and asked him to put it out a little from the shore, so that Jesus could speak with a louder voice that would reach everyone.  

In my younger days I used to preach in the open air.  If you can preach in the open air where there are so many distractions and distractors, that makes it so much easier to preach in a church where there are no distractions or distractors.  

I remember one time I was practicing in a cow pasture in England, imagining a multitude standing out in the field listening.  (Yes, preaching to a large crowd in the open air is a skill that must be practiced.)  As I practiced projecting my voice out there in the middle of nowhere, suddenly I sensed something behind me and turned to see a bull with several cows beside him.  When I looked at the bull, he began pawing the ground like they do just before charging.  In the moment, I was on a spiritual high and felt no fear of anything.  I pointed my finger at that bull and began preaching to him with the same loud voice, declaring that God gave man authority over the beasts of the field.  He stopped pawing the ground and the cows moved up between him and me.

That was my cue.  Once I saw the bull did not have a straight line to charge, I began backing toward the fence and when the fence was close enough, I ran for it and got to the other side.  The bull and cows had stayed where they were.  It was a moment in time that has stayed in my memory ever since.

The passage I read this morning reminded me of that event.

“Now it came about that while the multitude were pressing around Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.”  (Luke 5:1)",t2_ivoi3,fear_my_tube,0,1643205223.0,0,t1_huakow2,huakow2,True,fear_my_tube,t3_scx4my,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/scx4my/mike_sanders_do_not_vote_for_lisd_board_of/,Mike Sanders - do not vote for LISD Board of Trustees,/r/Leander/comments/scx4my/mike_sanders_do_not_vote_for_lisd_board_of/huakow2/,6,r/Leander,0,6

"My wife and I had dinner with a friend at Lucy’s Fried Chicken restaurant in Cedar Park on Friday evening.  I had been curious about the restaurant because I am a BIG FAN of fried chicken.  Fried chicken is probably my top three favorite meal.  
The restaurant itself is very nice, open space, picnic style bench tables and regular dining tables. The ambiance is nice; posters of Texas based musical acts and assorted Texana items decorate the restaurant.  
The food!  I had “The Basket”, a four piece order of fried chicken. Something to consider when ordering, sides are only with specific dishes.  My wife had the chicken and waffles, substituting the piece chicken with tenders.  Our friend had the staple item of many covered dish potluck dinners; chicken spaghetti.  As an appetizer we ordered the fried deviled eggs. 
The fried deviled eggs were good, not quite a Scotch Egg, but it came with a dipping sauce that was similar to a comeback sauce. 
The chicken basket I had was good, large pieces of crispy fried chicken that was juicy, I wanted a little more spice, but that’s why they have different hot sauces available on the table. 
The chicken and waffles were very good.  The waffles came with a honey butter that was delicious. The tenders were just as crispy and juicy as the piece chicken. 
The chicken spaghetti was loaded with chunks of pulled fried chicken and cheddar cheese and came garnished with a fried chicken wing.  Our friend enjoyed the spaghetti very much. 
I plan on returning to Lucy’s in the future, there are many other dishes served; fried fish, oysters, and the bar has a wide selection of spirits.",t2_56uzawak,James_Tx1967,0,1642996627.0,0,t1_htz5r4d,htz5r4d,True,James_Tx1967,t3_sbcobn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/sbcobn/lucys_fried_chicken/,Lucy’s Fried Chicken!!,/r/Leander/comments/sbcobn/lucys_fried_chicken/htz5r4d/,2,r/Leander,0,2

"Leander charges 8.25% in sales tax just like Austin. The same percentages go to city services. Like Leander, 1% goes to city services, 1% goes to the Metro Transit Authority. That is the deal they made in 1985. Leander has grown but transit options haven't except for rail. The level of service Leander is paying for 10 million dollars is crazy. As I mentioned, they could partner with carts and create a ride service, a lot of cities have because cap metro service is expensive and the services they provide are an afterthought in how they are using the money. I'm in Austin, I get it but I understand why the city wants to use the money in a better way as long as they still provide service for those based on ridership. Leander is paying way too much for public transportation. The kicker is it will cost 38 million for Leander to be released from it's contract with Austin so Austin will get its money without providing service. Educate yourself before you vote.

I've read that post-pandemic, nationwide, commuting is still going to be about 25 percent less than it was before because of WFH. Leander is full of white-collar workers that don't commute now because of it. I'm in Austin, it doesn't affect me but I understand why the city views it this way. As it is growing they are paying more without the ridership. They are collecting 10 million now and it's projected to go upwards to 18 million in the next couple of years. (sourced from basically all the local news sources) If I was in Leander I would only vote on it if they proposed a service somewhat comparable.

Honestly, I feel that cap metro has done us dirty.

But regardless of how bad it is, I still wouldn't vote to separate from the agreement because of of the penalty payments.

The problem really lies in the fact that if we fail to part ways we can't vote on the issue again for five years. That removes the city council's leverage to negotiate.

"“If Leander holds the election and voters approve leaving CapMetro's service area, the city would have to pay the transit agency more than $33 million based on a legal formula. That would amount to about three years in sales tax revenue.”

“If voters rejected leaving CapMetro, a withdrawal election could not be held again for at least five years.”

So in my mind, either way the voting goes, Leander is paying for AT LEAST 3 years of CapMetro. 

Don’t put it to a vote this time around, comeback in five years, see what the usage is like at that time, THEN decide if you want to put it on the ballot. If usage is still down, then Leander has lost 2 years of tax revenue to CapMetro with 5 years of access to CapMetro. Instead of losing 3 years of tax revenue upfront without access to CapMetro.

"Texas native here that spent 25 years in California and relocated in 2020.  We looked at San Antonio originally, but the employment happened in Austin.  

The Dallas/Ft Worth is going to be the most affordable of the 3 areas you are looking for.  Austin is going to be “most like” California with the technology companies, and there are a ton of opportunities in the healthcare field here.

I echo 183-A vs 35 (avoid at all costs, nightmare 24/7) and Leander and Georgetown are both great. Georgetown has more of a “downtown” area and more shopping and dining options than Leander.  Schools are better in Leander.

"Leander is a pretty great city to move to if you are looking to settle down. So is Georgetown. Honestly Georgetown was our first choice when we were house hunting but it was a little too far from work so my fiancé and I settled on Leander. That was about 2 years ago and for the most part we really like it. We are both in our early 30s as well and were looking for the same things as you all when we were considering which suburb of Austin to move to. Georgetown is still the better option IMO but I am happy living here. There are plenty of parks, lakes, and hiking trails nearby as someone noted below. I don’t personally think the restaurant scene is good out here but we also lived just south of downtown Austin before moving here so I was probably a little spoiled before. It’s still close enough to Austin that you can venture that way for more options if you feel the same way. The vibe here is pretty easygoing as well. People are friendly and the city is growing fast. It seems as though a lot of people in our age range are making the move in this direction which is great. We don’t have kids but all my parent friends rave about the Leander school district and it’s supposed to be one of the best in the area. Just a heads up, all the north Austin suburbs have been hit hard by the housing increases. I’m not sure what your budgets are but it’s going to be really hard finding anything under the mid 300s anywhere in this area. My fiancé is a homebuilder and just got done telling me that most new construction homes are doing another price hike bc of lumber increases. Since you all are in tech/healthcare you might also want to check out the Round Rock/Hutto area. Lots of tech and healthcare jobs out that way. 

As a side note, I’m from El Paso too and if you want a city similar to that feel, San Antonio would be your best bet by far. It’s also going to be the cheapest area out of the cities you mentioned.

"Honestly, prices are going up if you’re looking to build. However, the fact you are coming from CA, it may not be as much of a shock to you (or at least lessen it). I’m not familiar with SA or Dallas real estate, but some people are complaining about the price to build around here. If you look, there is a post in this subreddit about lots going for $600-650K. On top of that, there are is a massive backlog of homes to be built. Housing to buy and rent are hard to secure (from what I hear and read). 

As for the type of jobs you both are looking for m, I think this is great area! We have several new companies moving here or already here. I’m not sure how good tech jobs are, but healthcare jobs are definitely available!

As for activities, lots of cycling lanes in the area, some better than others. If you live in the suburbs, you are close enough to enjoy the comforts of a bigger city, yet stay in the ‘burbs to enjoy the “small town”. McKinney Falls State Park is in south Austin with hiking trails, fishing, swimming, and other activities (along with cabins to spend the night).

Personal note, I moved here from KY in 2007 and love it here! Most people are kind and has the small town feel to it, but yet big enough to enjoy and attract events for leisure. If it’s not in Austin, we can be in Dallas, San Antonio, or Houston within 4-6 hours. My only warning would be pay attention to events in Austin and plan your trips. There is very limited parking downtown and will likely need to know where to park before getting there (or at least try to). My wife and I always do this to avoid the panic of finding places to park once there. Heh. 

The school district in Leander are very good, according to those with kids. We don’t have any, but again, there is a post asking about this a few months ago. This subreddit isn’t very active, as you can see. 

Feel free to ask more if you want to. Hopefully I’ve given you a decent idea of the area. It’s growing quite a bit right now, so expect some growing pains, but overall we really love it here.

That is why we have infection control experts.  People who spent their lives learning how viruses work,  how to slow or stop pandemics. Being an armchair quarterback has never won a superbowl.  

Now here we all are.  Some trying to follow instructions,  wearing masks,  vaccinated,  and we are out of chicken, too. 

We had a pandemic response plan handed to Trump who dismantled it and said ""oh out will go away by summer""....2 years ago.  He stood on his own understanding,  and was WRONG.  In fact he made up a reality, which didn't work either.  

So suck it up, wear a mask,  get vaccinated, and pray for all those who are sick to get well.",t2_4y0irgyo,jarethmckenzie,0,1642389356.0,0,t1_hszphrl,hszphrl,True,JAMinLTX,t3_s5qyjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/s5qyjt/lets_go_brandon/,Let's Go Brandon!!!,/r/Leander/comments/s5qyjt/lets_go_brandon/hszphrl/,36,r/Leander,0,36

"After a long day and the big football game to watch, we opted to get chicken from The Thirsty Chicken in Leander. The Thirsty Chicken sells chicken wings, tenders, and daiquiris!
We ordered a couple of Hens; five tenders or ten wings. Tender for my wife and wings for myself. On the tenders the sauces were: Fowl Chicken (garlic Parm) and The Wet Willy (bbq sauce). The wings had The Tailfeather (lemon pepper) and Quack Quack (Asian heat).
The chicken strips were large and very
tender. The skin on was very crisp, the
sauces were very good. The Wet Willy was tangy and sweet, the Fowl Chicken savory with a slight bite of heat. The wings were excellent. The Tailfeather is a dry rub style of lemon pepper, a style that I really enjoy.
The Quack Quack sauce is very delicious, not quite teriyaki, and not quite bbq, but just delicious! The fries are a spiral cut fry, a little thicker than a normal French fry, but very enjoyable. The fries are also lightly seasoned. The dipping sauces were the traditional ranch and the ""house"". The house sauce was reminiscent of a “Comeback sauce"". I really enjoyed the flavor of the house sauce.

The restaurant itself is almost like a food truck. The interior is a walk-in order, dining is on the patio. This time of year there is weatherproofing for the patio. There are multiple daiquiri machines and there are DAIQUIRIS TO GO!!!

"Oops, sorry, totally misspoke (just edited to fix it- thanks for pointing out).  Being a **partner** city sucks.  Contract cities are the ones that get all the flexibility to tailor services to whatever they want.  Partner cities are at the mercy of what services CapMetro wants them to have.

The thing is there is no ""deal"" with CapMetro.  It's all by statute which is why an election would be necessary to exit as a partner.  As a partner city, we can ask for rebates but it's up to CapMetro to decide whether or not to give them.  CapMetro's stance has been that the cost of service for Leander is higher than most other partner cities because of the rail, so they don't feel the need to rebate us.  However they do rebate the City of Austin, which has the highest cost of service of all.

"Thank you.  There are a few different options outlined in the presentation slides.  Council could pick one of the options or a hybrid of things.  Whether that's a contract with CapMetro or something we operate ourselves remains to be determined, but we are still in talks with CapMetro about all options, both in and out.  

As for when service would begin, we would be legally obligated to provide paratransit services at a minimum on day one upon exiting.  It doesn't make sense for us to only have that in place with nothing else, so I'd imagine that rolling that out would be (ideally) contemporaneous with full service.  There's also potential that if there were an exit, we could perhaps contract short term with CapMetro while we get other service solidified.  

Bottom line, if we're going to do this, it's going to be as smooth as possible with the most minimal (if any) interruption.

"Alright, let's talk about CapMetro and the city.

CapMetro has two forms of service: Partner cities (like us) who lose half of all sales tax income off the top to pay for services, and contract cities like Round Rock who decide what services they want and write a check to CapMetro for those services.

The truth about being a partner city is it sucks.  You pay a small ransom and have \*zero\* say in your service.  Seriously.  Zero.  That circulator bus that we've had the last two years that's pretty popular - CapMetro won't expand the service area and there's nothing we can do about it.  If that seems crazy and ass backward, it's because it is.

So what this council did a few months ago was decide to put everything to rest by hiring an independent firm to evaluate the service we receive, the actual ridership, and where residents actually want to go because make no mistake, if we put this on a ballot and the public chooses to leave, we're either contracting or creating our own service the very next day.

For years, we have asked CapMetro for data on ridership and we receive estimates because nobody actually counts.  And for years we've asked for service expansions and we're frequently told ""no"".  And finally, for years, we've asked for financial assistance because every single other entity in CapMetro receives a rebate in one form or another, but Leander, specifically, is told ""no"" over and over again.

The independent study went out and counted riders and it scanned the license plates in the parking lot to determine where the riders were coming from.  48% of the license plates had a Leander address and that includes areas that aren't actually in the city limits that we don't service - neighborhoods like Larkspur, Summerlyn, and Block House.

Let's go back to talking about contract services.  CapMetro received more than $9 million in Leander sales tax last year and it will be more than $10 this year.  According to the study though, [our current service cost is only $7.9 million](https://imgur.com/YMWAfHD), and remember, we have zero say in expanding that service to realize the full $9+ million in costs.

Take a look too at Leander's costs for service versus what similar cities are paying in contract services around the state.  Our costs are astronomically higher including when you look at cities with twice as many residents. Here's [the comparison overall](https://imgur.com/yYBXMud); and the [one for per capita](https://imgur.com/SuhtnOv).  They're both depressing.

If you look at the study that came to council, there are several service alternatives and they're all millions less than what we're currently paying.

And let's be clear about what happens to the sales tax that we would get back from exiting CapMetro.  It would go into a Type B Economic Development Corporation.  Yes, some of that money could be used to incentivize employers to bring primary jobs to Leander.  Also though, Type B Economic Development Corporations are able to use their funds for community development, including parks, street and drainage improvements, public safety, and even affordable housing.  Don't take my word for it, [check out the list of projects on the Texas Comptroller's website](https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/type-ab/type-b.php/).

Personally, I'm not looking at this as ""screw the train, we're out and taking these money bags"".  What I'm looking at is an inadequate water infrastructure, a police department that has outgrown their facility, and a demand for parks and services that the city can't afford.  And I look over here at CapMetro, and the gobs of money they receive every year and the continued lack of interest they display in our community and our needs.  I have this study now that tells me exactly how to replicate the existing service and expand it for less cost and still have money leftover for investing in our community.  Not to mention that the majority of our current investment is benefitting people who don't even live in the Leander city limits, who aren't affected by our water issues or lack of funding for services.

You all didn't elect us to be poor stewards of our money.  You all elected us because you know that we're going to carefully weigh all options and make the best decisions we can for Leander's future.  Trust me when I say that Council is doing that.

**Side note:** it's not being reported anywhere, but in our last meeting where we received the transit analysis/study, we also approved moving forward working with CapMetro on an interlocal agreement which might just solve some of these issues.  But due to deadlines for calling the election, we're still moving forward while we attempt to work on the agreement.  Tonight's meeting isn't putting it on the ballot, it's just approving the language if we do put it on the ballot.  That decision will probably be made two weeks from today (our next meeting).

If you've made it this far, you're a superstar, thank you for indulging me.  I'd urge any of you who want to know about the costs and services and where Leander stands, to watch the recording of the presentation to council from last month.  If you're short on time and just want to look through the slides, that's available too.  But don't take the media's word or your neighbor or even my word for what's going on.  If it's important to you, invest in getting the information directly from the source.  Links below.

"I moved to Leander from north Austin at the end of June. Main pull for me was the school district (I have a 3-year-old and 1-year-old). We looked at Round Rock and Cedar Park also, but find the prices in Leander to be the best for what you got. There are a ton of new builds going up, but we found a nice older house with mature oak trees and a large backyard. We feel a hell of a lot safer here than north Austin. At first it felt a little ""out here,"" but really so much is close in terms of shopping and dining. I appreciate the short term ""smaller town"" feel.

"So, it really depends on what you are looking for and how much are you willing to pay for things. My wife and I lived in Round Rock before moving to Leander/Liberty Hill. In Round Rock you are in the mix of things. Meaning you have a good choice of restaurants. If you live close to a strip mall or other venues you may be in walking distance to enjoy them. 

Cedar Park—from what I’ve seen, there are some nice shopping centers in the area. I’m not very familiar with the neighborhoods, but I doubt most are more than 15 minutes away from the Whitestone/1431 shopping centers, and Bell Blvd (old 183) has some nice ones too. 

Leander—we live in the Grayson neighborhood and it seems most things are 15-25 minutes away. If you don’t mind driving some to get to things it’s nice out here. Things are growing quickly, so hopefully it will be similar to Cedar Park soon in regards to not needing to drive as far out soon. The flip side is there are some really good mom and pop restaurants here!  

If you need more information on anything I will try my best. The closer you get to Austin, the more it will cost you. If you are looking to have a home built, you will likely be waiting a bit. I think the market is still really backed up, coupled with high lumber costs and other goods being transported.

"Median days on market in Leander right now is 34, the highest its been since the rush started. Prices have stabalized since beginning of year. Sale-to-List price has come down from 110% to 101%. 16% of houses are having to drop the price (highest of 2021). 80% were selling over list in July, down under 50% now.

There are plenty of signs of things cooling off. 

Plenty of people heard stories of these bidding wars that were happening earlier in the year and are positioning themselves to sell into the market (it takes time to get a house ready to sell), so inventory got historically low combined with a lot of demand from refugees of the Peoples Republic of California, and prices flew up. Now there are enough people willing to sell and move to cheaper places, you won't see that kind of explosion going forward barring some other major event.

The other big risk is if the Fed has to raise rates to combat inflation. If that happens, that cuts a lot of demand for debt, which will price people out of homes, and cut prices. I'm not sure I'd count on the Fed raising rates as the whole economy is held together by duct tape and chewing gum and they might prefer to just let inflation win out over other pain. In a massive debt bubble, a little bit of pain can quickly turn into a lot as the whole thing implodes, and a 5x leverage (or more) is risky.",t2_a8sua,smartfbrankings,0,1638366537.0,0,t1_hmsmtrq,hmsmtrq,False,vigneshr97,t3_r5rdw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/r5rdw0/leander_vs_hutto/,Leander vs Hutto,/r/Leander/comments/r5rdw0/leander_vs_hutto/hmsmtrq/,1,r/Leander,0,1

"Inventory has already increased a lot and I'm seeing lot more houses stay on the market for longer and longer. The price increases have motivated a lot of people to try to sell now and move out to cheaper areas and take profit. New home construction is more stable with lumber prices closer to normal. Inflation is rampant, so it's possible that prices do rise in next 6 months, but not at rates as high as many other items.

Buying when being scared of being priced out will get you burned very quickly. However, our political class will do everything possible to keep things increasing in value and prevent any kind of paper losses or else the entire credit bubble unwinds.

A big difference is Hutto was actually a town for much longer (established 1876), whereas Leander wasn't even a city until 1978, which explains why there is a town center for Hutto but not Leander.

Hutto population <1000 until 2000, then has exploded to a suburb of 27k (about 10 years behind Leander), which was a larger area (2-10k between 1980 and 2000), but has exploded since then.",t2_a8sua,smartfbrankings,0,1638296882.0,0,t1_hmoy2eo,hmoy2eo,False,vigneshr97,t3_r5rdw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/r5rdw0/leander_vs_hutto/,Leander vs Hutto,/r/Leander/comments/r5rdw0/leander_vs_hutto/hmoy2eo/,7,r/Leander,0,7

"Used to live near Hutto and now live in Leander.

Hutto was basically farmland until pretty recently and has been exploding lately. It's flat, has good soil, and very few trees. Huge housing explosion lately. Driving downtown would likely take you through 130, pretty straight shot to the airport, but is tolled. Not as straight a shot downtown and may run you into 35, which is awful. The houses I saw going up in Hutto a few years ago were mostly of the cheap/packed together types, although that may have changed. Hutto has a small ""old town"" downtown that Leander does not have, with a few shops and restaurants and is close to Taylor, which has even more of a ""small town"" feel.

Leander grew up a little bit before Hutto, so you'll have more established housing, also is a bit more wooded/hilly. Leander has the train station that can get you downtown (when it runs) which may be appealing to some. 183 to Mopac to get downtown - tolled road, but fairly manageble. Leander also is getting a ton of growth to the north and east, and likely will be more ""central"" of a suburb than Hutto, which is still pretty much on the outskirts. This may change once the Samsung plant opens up between Hutto and Taylor.

Leander reminds me a lot of what Round Rock was 15 years ago. Established, but about to enter a massive phase of growth. There have been several plans for more dense shopping/living areas as well in Leander that may drive values up. 

I don't think you'll get a huge difference other than some personal preferences on a few things, or if you have particular interests that guide you to one over the other (Leander closer to the lake, if you have a boat, probably stay this way, for example).

"It’s not hard and shouldn’t be intimidating. I truly loved the LTC class and beginner class I took my wife too at Shady Oaks. I couldn’t recommend that place enough due to the fact it’s hot outside (normally) and it’s indoor AC. 

Their rental guns are in pretty good shape being rentals and it’s truly a good skill to have. I recommend firearms training to everyone, especially those that aren’t gun enthusiasts because you see both sides of our country one in favor and one not. This allows you to learn in a safe environment by professionals and you can make up your own mind. 

I personally learned how to shoot as a child in Michigan in the 80’s so I’ve been shooting for years but I truly think I got more from the beginner class than my wife because I had inherited a few bad habits over the years and learned some new breathing exercises to help my aim.

"Hi! So the way it works is if your batteries are charged to 100% then any excess power generated by solar during the day gets fed back to the grid. The power company has a base $20/month fee for connecting to the grid that never goes away, so it goes towards eating that bill away. Last month our power bill was $4.

And yes, the batteries can power the home. We can last 8-12 hours with HEAVY AC usage (4,000 SF house), 20-24~ hrs with only heater usage (natural gas), or nearly 35~ hrs with just normal usage around the house and no air temp adjustment.

The above estimates are without any solar energy during the day supplementing/adding back to the battery charge.

"Honestly, if you can homeschool, that is literally the best kept secret they won't tell you :-)  Up until around first grade, real learning is limited to around an hour a day. As a parent you can totally make that time up with at home (thanks to \[paid\] home schooling curriculums and educational games). Plus as a parent, you will give your kid the best care they can ever receive. That was the lesson we learned as parents during the pandemic :-)  Home schooling can be complemented with part time day care at one of these schools.

As you can tell we and our neighbors had bad experiences with area day cares. From ""science"" schools that don't teach science, to overworked teachers that treat kids badly, to schools that don't let kids be kids (cough cough some of those Montessori schools).

"O' for the love of all things. We just had a water softener installed about a month ago we should have done it 20 years ago. Our coffee is better, our dishwasher and washing machine work better, showers feel more refreshing, and drinking the tap water doesn't feel/taste off.

Call the guys over at Proven Pluming (512-296-5604). First, they didn't want to charge me a visit fee for a sales call. Second their team, every one, was professional and punctual. And if they had to change an appointment they contacted me early and worked to reschedule. And lastly, the quote was fair and the equipment was quality.

We decided to install the unit, with a large carbon filter, because we needed to replace our water heater and figured we could extend the life of our new water heater if we installed the softener.

On the negative side, we had to replace our dishwasher about a week after the water softener was installed. Seems the only thing sealing our pan was years of caked on calcium, and a week of soft water and dish washing cleared the buildup and killed the machine.",t2_3z7d8,punknubbins,0,1634698829.0,0,t1_hhbfqyi,hhbfqyi,True,madbrunette,t3_qbnwri,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leander/comments/qbnwri/water_softener_questions/,Water softener questions!,/r/Leander/comments/qbnwri/water_softener_questions/hhbfqyi/,1,r/Leander,0,1

Hey Texas Food Dude!  YT subscriber here. I live about 2 minutes away from Sabinos and have eaten there a number of times. I totally agree their space is pretty great for being in a highway strip mall development.  I think they did a good job with their design and the open kitchen. One thing I don't like is that they don't cut their Chicago style pizza for you - I can't tell if that's intentional or if they just always forget. Their sandwiches rock.  Would love to see you review the Cedar Park Via 313 when it opens.

"Sabino’s deep dish is better. Rosatis thin crust is better. It’s better because the sabinos thin is still a little too thick, but the taste of sabinos thin is actually nice to me. Just too much crust. The rosatis thin crust does have the true Chicago style flavor though. 

Funny thing is, I grew up in Chicago. Neither me or anyone I know ever just said, “hey let’s go to rosatis!” Not because rosatis is bad, it’s definitely solid, but because so many other places are just better. Especially whatever mom and pop pizza joint is walking distance from your house. 

Now, I can’t get enough rosatis. It’s closer to my house so I go there more than sabinos.

"Lit is going to be the challenge. You'll basically be sticking to sidewalks on main roads. Definitely doable, although on concrete (if you don't mind).   


If you want more trail running, a few places (unlit afaik) are Garey Park (paid to enter), Southwest Williamson County Park, Lakewood Park.  Might be some trails around Crystal Falls Golf Course.

The other best bet, I don't know if it's lit is a bit further but not terribly far along the Brushy Creek Greenbelt. There's a pretty long trail along it starting from the YMCA that makes it all the way to Round Rock.
