"A single carpet beetle isn't a ""burn everything"" problem. The adults are harmless. They eat pollen and can come inside on cut flowers. They're common enough to find their own way in in any case. Almost any house will have an occasional adult beetle.

It's the larva that are a problem. They eat dried protein including wool, silk, feathers, dried bugs, dried pet food, etc. They can therefore eat holes in natural-fiber items like wool blankets, rugs, and sweaters. To control the larva, first learn to recognize them. Then vacuum regularly in quiet places where household dust collects, e.g., under beds, under furniture, in the backs of closets, and along baseboards. (Household dust contains hair and skin flakes that can feed the larva.) This is an easy DIY job, no reason to pay money for pest control, and no reason to use insecticides.

If you see larva or their shed skins, or if you find new holes in blankets or clothing, then also launder or dry clean anything nearby that contains wool or other dried protein fibers.",t2_n0t1y,basaltgranite,0,1649005175.0,0,t1_i38r3jz,i38r3jz,True,Beekatiebee,t3_tut6k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/tut6k4/advice_for_dealing_with_carpet_beetles/,Advice for dealing with carpet beetles?,/r/oregon/comments/tut6k4/advice_for_dealing_with_carpet_beetles/i38r3jz/,2,r/oregon,0,2

"Depending on your time and budget, I'd fly into Portland, rent an RV or van you can sleep in (most lodgings might be booked already and you'll have more freedom camping but make your reservations now if you want to stay within the parks) and camp/road trip instead of staying in one place. Then hit some great places as you head south from Portland to Crater Lake and back up North. This is a guideline and you could easily spend several days in each spot or adjust based on your interests/time/budget. 

Trip 1: Portland to Silver Falls State Park (just outside of Salem)

Trip 2: Silver Falls to Bend (you could stay here for a few days, take in a show, walk the river trail, summit a mountain, have some good food and craft beer, etc.)

Trip 3: Bend to Crater Lake

Trip 4: Crater lake to Oregon Caves (you'll go through Grants Pass which is a great town)

Trip 5: Oregon Caves to Brookings (you'll dip into California for a bit, but it's worth it for the coast- Be sure to visit Samuel H. Boardman, especially around sunset!)

Trip 6: Brookings to Bandon 

Trip 7: Bandon to Newport

"> It’s worth going to at least once.

Its a crowded event and only seems to get worse every year. Most of your time is spent slowly shuffling though lines. If I recall correctly, vendors that are established also have first dibs on keeping their spot on the vendor lists so the only time there is an opening for a new artist or vendor is when one leaves, which isnt often. Ive been to OCF five times and its always the same vendors with the same wares.  
  
The other problem is the music/artists. Its not exactly stadium seating and finding a place to stand or sit to enjoy a show has become really tough. Even worse with the smaller performing artists and musicians. There might be room for 20 people tops and if you arent on the spot when a show starts, you can barely find elbow room.

"This is all in Southern Oregon, so weather is predictably dry that time of year.  Fires could be an issue.  This area is the jewel that local preservationists have labored for decades to protect.  I have lived in this area, and hiking around here is really nice.  Of course Ashland has Lithia Park, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, and the Ashland Community Food Store.  Lots of spirituality and pot growing of course.

>**Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument near Ashland, Oregon**  
>  
>Established in 2000, Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is the nation’s first monument designated in recognition of an area’s biological diversity. A tremendous variety of plants and animals make their homes amidst the monument’s rich fir forests, oak groves, grasslands, and canyons. Pristine streams flow through the monument and are home to trout found nowhere else. Lush meadows teem with an assortment of butterflies nearly unsurpassed in the United States. The monument is also a bird haven as more than 200 species have been documented here, including the northern spotted owl, the great gray owl and the peregrine falcon. To appreciate the outstanding biodiversity as well as exceptional geologic complexity that characterize this landscape, look east to the high deserts of the Great Basin, north and south to the Cascades and west to the Siskiyou and Klamath Mountains. Influences from each of these regions converge in the 53,000-acre monument, giving it its multilayered biological composition. The PCT enters the southwestern corner of the monument near Interstate 5 and Pilot Rock. It then meanders through the monument, passing Soda Mountain before it departs at a crossing of Highway 66 at Green Springs Summit. The trail then reenters the monument briefly as it skirts the eastern shores of Hyatt Lake.  
>  
>As the PCT meanders in and out of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, it passes the monument’s most famous geologic structure, the basalt outcrop called Pilot Rock. Pilot Rock was given its name during the time of the Euro-American pioneers because it served as guide for travelers crossing Siskiyou Pass between Oregon and California.  
>  
>**PilotRock**  
>  
>At an elevation of 5,908 feet, Pilot Rock is a volcanic plug, a remnant of a feeder vent left behind after its surrounding volcano eroded away. From the PCT, it’s worth a side trip to ascend to the craggy Pilot Rock viewpoint. Just follow the obvious side trail that leads less than one half-mile to the base of the rock. From there, you’ll see a chute to the top, which affords a captivating view of the monument’s undulating patchwork of peaks, valleys, and forests. Be aware that, although it’s a scramble and not a technical climb, the hike up Pilot Rock can be dangerous for the inexperienced. Additionally, seasonal closures to protect peregrine falcons are sometimes necessary.  
>  
>Distance: out-and-back, 12 miles to Pilot Rock.  
>  
>Trailhead driving directions: The easiest place to access the PCT in the monument is at Green Springs Summit. From I-5, take exit 14 near Ashland and turn on Highway 66 toward Klamath Falls. Take Hwy 66 for 17 miles to Green Springs Summit. A trailhead and parking area are located at the summit. From there, follow the PCT 6 miles north to Hyatt Reservoir or south to Soda Mountain, Hobart Bluff, and Pilot Rock (12 miles).

"Ok hold on - I'm not advocating *against* high speed rail or alternative transportation. I'm merely pointing out that NIMBY's objecting to  someone building standard gauge track with a 200 mph train through their *neighborhood* (i.e. not the I-5 corridor or existing rail) is a legitimate complaint. This sub always seems to conflate ""Not in my backyard"" with ""Not in my City."" Nobody's going to object to adding HSR to the I-5 corridor or along existing standard track (Amtrak). 

Also - NIMBY's are far from the only blockade to high-speed rail. This project is a goddamn pipe dream. Washington Legislature tucked away $150M and anticipate another $600M from the feds. This is a $30 *billion* project. So in five years we're close to securing 3% of the overall project funding. Great - at this rate we'll be there in another 165 years.

CHSRA - for reference - passed their first bond measure in 2008, started Phase I in 2015 and anticipates completing the stretch from San Fran-San Jose-Merced by 2025. That's *seventeen years* to complete 171 miles - roughly the same distance from PDX to Seattle, let alone Vancouver BC. They don't anticipate having SJ - LA track completed for *another* decade.

So even if we were to, say, pass a $10B bond measure this year to kick things off, if we follow in CHSRA's timeline the PDX - Vancouver rail won't be done until 2050.

"**NIMBY, an acronym for the phrase ""not in my back yard"", or Nimby, is a characterization of opposition by residents to proposed developments in their local area, as well as support for strict land use regulations. It carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them and that they would tolerate or support it if it were built farther away.**

"Well that's the cool part about these union jobs dude, they are literally going to pay you and train you at the same time. All you gotta do is show up with a positive attitude and ready to learn. Best part is after 4-5 years you get your license. With that you can work anywhere and your level of income is going to be very good.

"Just to clarify, I worked for a very large company with multiple locations across the United States.  This information was valid when I retired 2 years ago. 

Our company didn't like overtime ether. The rules are not too hard to explain.

If your company pay period is Thursday - Wednesday = that simply means all hours worked in that period. Not the standard calendar week. The week starts at the beginning of the workday on Thursday. Cut off time for that week is the end of the workday on Wednesday. Most employers give workers 2 days off during the weekly period. Those hours are not paid time off. If you work a combination of hours that keeps you at 40 hours with no time off, (7 days a week) that may be a violation.

Top word is this.

If you have more than (It used to be 20) employees working for your company (in state). The employer is supposed to have both State and Federal wage and hour posters posted. These must be where all personal working can see and read them.    

There is some confusion, many small business owners make the mistake thinking that means per location. It's not. Sometimes they have different names for each location but the license holder remains the same.  

Any further questions might be answered by reading The State Employment Divisions web site. ( Ymigr8 has posted a link for you )

"I work in the electrical trade industry so I love these questions. Are you open to work in the trades? Because we need labor!Our construction/contracting companies are always in need of laborers as well as apprentices and skilled labor. That being said if you would prefer to stay East of the cascades, there are tons of data centers being built right now in Boardman and Umatilla. If your not into trade labor, just consider for a moment all the support that's needed to build these projects. You could get another sales job at a PLATT or North Coast Electrical supply, easily. You could go work for United Rentals or PAPE\` Rentals, delver man lifts and forks to job sites. Or you could become a junior project manager and work your way up in an office.

word of caution though... it's expensive here. Like, [we rank as the 14th most expensive state in the country for renters.](https://www.earnest.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-rent-in-your-city-or-state/) With the average rent costing $1,350 a month. So unless you're coming with some bankroll saved up, plan on a roommate for a few years until you've established yourself. Even then it's going to be hard to go solo. So consider your support systems, have a back up plan incase moving here turns out to be a mistake. And for the love of god, if your going to drive the less than the speed limit on the highway - stay to the right.

Good luck.

"If you have relatively the same overtime every week, it shouldn’t really matter how you divide the 7 day block. Over the course of months, you’ll still end up with the same average amount of overtime.

It doesn’t matter how you slice the weeks, over time it will average out to the same overtime.

"Ahhhh thank you for this! Studded tires are HORRIBLE for pavement, particularly concrete roads. They are why we have such bad rutting. And the only way to get rid of ruts on concrete is to diamond grind down the rest of the concrete to match the depth of the rut. You can only do that a few times before you can’t do it anymore and have to replace the pavement (unlike asphalt, concrete is very tricky to overlay with more concrete and while some states do it successfully, not many have success and it’s still an emerging field.)

Some of the urban areas of Oregon (Portland, Salem, west coast) doesn’t suffer enough snow to warrant studded tires. Hearing that rattle down my street when there has been frost on the grass and not even a flake of snow just kills me inside!
