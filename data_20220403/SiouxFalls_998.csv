She got 7 years in the state pen.

Janklow slob, got 55 days in county jail, then 45 days with work release.

The State Bar claims that any lawyer guilty of a felony is automatically disbarred.

Janklow was the special hotdog beneficiary of a convenient exception to that rule (Wild Bill was allowed to practise law again against the rules that apply to other people).....The clown show boob SD Sup Ct made an exception for old Bill....and the presiding punk Judge was an overrated slob boob who personifies cronyistic corruption as a South Dakota Family value for all the smug good solid citizens out there in hotdog land.

That same presiding Judge of SD SC, also round filed six State Bar Ethics complaints that I signed and sent, which were obstructed by Thomas C. Barnett.  I appealled to The SD Sup Ct, and that presiding Judge did not allow the entire court to consider my appeal en banc (all together).

Just a silent determination that caught the rest of the court off guard.  None of them demanded that they could also see what had been done and could consider the appeal.

Not one of those joker jack ass Judges, sought to Impeach The presiding Judge of The SD Supreme Court for those dubious actions?

These facts show you what a corrupt clown show The ineffable and vaunted SD State Bar is.....when complaints are round filed and not reviewed so that disciplinary actions are consistent.

"Detached governor denies housing to potential renters and $81 million to landlords in order to make political statement.

Making housing more affordable would allow more workers to move here and fill those open job positions. But she must think that it is better to keep those jobs vacant so she can use the number of open jobs as a political prop. Maybe it will help her presidential campaign?

Also the $81 million would have gone to landlords in the form of rent payments. I guess landlords must have enough money and don't want that money.

""Fastest growing income"" doesn't mean that the income is high for people who would use rental assistance. It means that the remote workers who moved here are getting paid higher than the South Dakota workers. The rental workers are not getting paid enough to keep up with rental increases.

This political stunt cost the South Dakotan economy $81 million. By comparison, the pheasant season generates $200 million to the state GDP. So using the governor's logic, $200 million is very important to SD, and $80 million is not worth the effort.

At least the governor is reducing federal spending (at the expense of South Dakotans)",t2_a4rv29bn,TurtleSandwich0,0,1648822133.0,0,t1_i2zh0ym,i2zh0ym,True,AutoModerator,t3_ttjphj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiouxFalls/comments/ttjphj/weekly_anything_goes_free_talk_friday/,Weekly 'anything goes' free talk Friday.,/r/SiouxFalls/comments/ttjphj/weekly_anything_goes_free_talk_friday/i2zh0ym/,4,r/SiouxFalls,0,4

"It's two fold. It eliminates visibility straight on, which prevents driving ""through"" the roundabout in poorly lit intersections or drivers being dazzled by headlights on the other side.

">Yes, it's normal, my mom died Jan last year, my Dad died December. Same stuff, I just dealt with it, they never bent the rules, and I never asked them to.

I'm sorry but it's really not normal. You should be able to see your loved ones before they pass in a hospital. People should not die alone. It doesn't matter if the patient has covid or not- so long as they are deemed non-transmissable and if they are, then just segregate and allow observation from outside the room. In 2020 it was acceptable that people couldn't be visited and we kind of didn't know a lot but at this point we are past 2 years of covid and the adjustments sanford and avera have needed to make have not been done. Stop letting companies settle to serve you for less. Sanford makes millions each year even as a non-profit. They can do better and we need to hold them to that standard. I'm not OP but I don't think I'm asking them to ""bend the rules."" I'm asking them to implement rules that are objective and scientific in nature. The current covid rules Sanford has applied do not prevent transmission, they do not check if people have had covid, and most importantly, all they do is frustrate everyone involved.

>My aunt had Sepsis and she also had Covid Pnumonia and was on a vent and no visitors, at Avera, It's a covid rule.

I'm not sure on Avera's rules but Sanford isn't actually checking if you're sick. Nor does the rules Sanford have in place actually prevent the transmission of COVID aside from limiting 2 people in a room, but you can rotate people out of the rooms all day. They also do not temp check anyone. I had to go to Sanford every 6 weeks and they never temperature checked me, even after check in. They didn't even temperature check me even though I was receiving immunosuppressive drugs at an incredibly high dosage that you are not supposed to take when you are sick. When I visited a patient every day for about a week they never temp checked me. Calling what Sanford is doing ""covid prevention"" is laughable at best. It's like 2% of what they should be doing to prevent covid. Either disbar patient visitations completely, actually check if someone might be sick, or don't do anything at all. This half-assed approach of ""do you have covid?"" is so lame and useless, and this policy of ""please don't sit in the building, but you can sit in our parking lots"" is also just a waste of everyone's time.

edit: downvoted for such amazing hot takes as ""people shouldn't die alone"" and ""Sanford should check people's temperatures to prevent the spread of covid""

"If the winds are strong out of the east and west, don't go. Crosswinds (east/west) make the loop rather tedious because so much of the trail is north/south. If the winds are strong out of the north, go counterclockwise. If the winds are strong out of the south go clockwise. 

The longest stretch of north south that doesn't have significant treecover is the western side of the trail, from the butterfly house all the way to the tip of the airport, so you want that side to have the tailwind. The eastern side is mostly parks and shrouded by trees to help mitigate the wind. There's just a couple miles east of the airport that are brutal then from the airport tip to the penitentiary.

"My dad was in critical care at Sanford and I think we ran into the same woman. I'm not sure the exact situation you're in but my grandma (who at the time had a bad hip) was sitting in the registration area instead of the central waiting area and that same lady (taking a guess it's her) came in and told us we can't sit here. The central area was full and she can't stand that long so what are we supposed to do, make her stand?

Sanford has a lot of COVID rules and I get why but they need to adjust their building for catering to these rules rather than expecting patients and families to adjust. Why not dedicate parts of the unused building as segregated cabins for families for rotations? the first floor of the heart hospital is basically empty cuz they funnel everyone thru the main area now.

There's a Sanford nurse in this thread who's pretty fired up but if the issue is people bringing in COVID why has Sanford at the very least not expanded testing. They don't even temp gun you anymore so obviously this facade of preventing COVID is completely untrue. Sanford.could be doing way more for the community. This is from someone who gives them $5k a year and visits around 50 times a year due to Crohn's. It's laughable how they treat patient families vs patients. I can walk thru the door and just say I'm outpatient and they literally do not care about my existence.

"For me, it was a combination of being understaffed, being bored, and not being respected. The hospital purposely over-scheduled the CT scanners with outpatients but we still had to fit in inpatients and emergencies. I felt like I was herding sheep. I got into radiology to connect with patients but we simply couldn't. Next, it got boring really fast. I mean, we scanned mostly heads and abdomens. I wanted a challenge. It got the point where I hoped for trauma patients and that felt wrong. Finally, I got sick of being underpaid and disrespected by Drs and nurses. Had a nurse say she rather be stuck with a coding patient in an elevator than in x-ray. They thought of us as button pushers but we had to know CPR, we started IVs, we lifted our own patients, we administered contrast on top of running million dollar equipment. We had to know physics and radiation protection as well as anatomy and pathology. Many of my fellow techs had bachelor's degrees and we're required to do continuing education to maintain our certification. But I heard nurses say anyone could do my job.

"I think I did a poor job of reading the audience before posting this. Well that and expressing myself with a bit too much profanity to ever allow it to be a constructive conversation. I also didn’t think of myself as coming across like the very people I loathed these last two years. Seeing someone in that state, on a ventilator (no it’s not COVID) when three months ago they drove 100 miles each direction in the same day to and from a family gathering, while it was also snowing, it’s just a shock to see that much of a change and then having someone talking down to me and other family condescendingly.  I felt the way they handled it was less than professIonal. I really shouldn’t have even complained about the policy. I think management should have trained them with better talking points. This was the first time I’ve had a problem with them in Sioux Falls. Fargo locations are responsible for the others. One of the times being their new hospital and they had no gradual plan it seemed before doubling their staff overnight. And it seemed like all of the new hires were at the new hospital and they didn’t bring a single tenured person over. So you have a well meaning but just out of school RN and then a bunch of temporary aides. The type that would be like, “gee, how did that call button get pressed” and would just turn it off and leave. That’s just the tip that led to a sequence of events that would almost sound like a dark comedy.

Maybe I said too much and just need to let the thread/post reach it’s natural conclusion. I just never intended this to be about all healthcare workers, it makes me feel bad it came across that way. If I knew it could be read that way I would have looked at how I worded things more. And also not been crude with my language. I don’t blame people who basically told me to fuck off in this thread.

Plus, these employees have probably given the same speech to patient families day in and day out for 2 years. It's exhausting. They're burnt out. 
Add to that patients are assholes when they are sick (I am a real whiny a-hole). Family is worse. They expect the red carpet treatment from people that can't give them. 
When I worked there, I got 1% bonuses. Not because I was a bad employee but because HR didn't allow anything higher. That's likely the case for that person.

There isn’t. Grief, pain, suffering… they’re all relative. But when you’re in a hospital it is safe to assume most of the people there have some combination of those things.

Edit: I hit the button to post too soon. 

Anyways I was going to say in hindsight I am barking up the wrong tree to blame that woman too much. Sanford just has terrible high level managers. They’re are driven by their bonuses. I should probably feel bad for her to have to be out in a shit situation.

Second. Have your ID handy, unlike the other posters here, you actually have to be an adult to play in that sandbox. 

The staff are very friendly and helpful and speak English so they will be able to get you in the right direction if you act like an adult. 

You have 3 choices, buy a “theater pass” , “arcade pass” or buy both of them for a small discount. I believe the single pass is 10 and both is 15….I can’t remember because I’m usually busy wiping the foam from my mouth at this point. 

Time limit is until closing time for the day. You can come and go as you please and as long as you are not disrupting your fellow thrill seekers. 

You are asking specifically about the private rooms specifically though. There’s about 10 different rooms and all are different, I think one even has a couch but most have a small wooden bench. There is an optional deadbolt for your privacy. Some rooms are very easy to peek into some are not.

"I'll break down my thoughts like I did the Tenhaken one.

I like:

- Decriminalizing weed would be great, especially if the Pen is as full as I hear. A mayor can't really legalize, though you could tell SFPD to not go after anyone for minor possession. The difference would be one would still have to buy from a dealer or bring it down from Flandeau. That difference would still help a lot of people out in the city. 

- I'm down for more green initiatives. I think my local section of the bike trail is already nearly all native grasses, but if city engineers are sure tree roots won't negatively effect levees or river banks, I'm all for planting a line of trees. If solar heat can make a difference for large buildings like the Pavillion, then I think that's a great investment too. 

- I support decreasing penalties for minor crimes in general, but I don't really know how many would fall under Municipal laws?

- Additional budget for Police training is good. One issue a lot of cops talk about is how little they're actually trained for stressful situations which can lead to tragedies even when one is not a Derek Chauvin tier prick. SFPD has it's issues but is otherwise pretty non-offensive outside of the few pedos that got busted. Training, from conflict resolution to even additional range time can help keep it that way. 

- That you're running as someone with your own issues and not as a party or platform. Civil engagement that isn't just voting is stellar. I'd be wanting to run for something local myself if I wasn't absolutely sure I'd be caught on camera calling someone a dumb fucker or worse on the campaign trail. I have a bit of ""engineer mouth"" and don't have the charisma or patience for politics. 

- I'm not sure how big of an issue Zoning is for house building (u/sodakzak could probably answer this for me), but if lack of residential land is a problem, lets get crackin. 

Cons:

- Less specifics than I'd want. Lot of things I agree with heartily on principle. But specifically how would one support food forests? Municipal run businesses in areas like off Kiwanis that are now fairly far from grocery stores? Tax breaks for private grocers to move into areas of need? I generally see good things without detail of implementation to be platitudes.

- I hope to god the bounty system on meth dealers is in the vein of paying people if someone is successfully prosecuted that you called a tip in for, and not like, a bounty-bounty. If it's the first one, I think we already have that. Would the tip bounty just be raised for Meth dealers/manufacturers? 

- Could you really clean up the Big Sioux? Sure, there's likely trash to pull out of the river, but isn't the worst part of the Big Sioux is from ag runoff from farms upstream.

- Are there not reasons construction is not generally done at night or around the clock already? I'd imagine it's harder to see construction workers and there's additional costs for lights and paying a premium for workers to work nights, along with concerns about more drunk drivers being on the road. If these concerns aren't issues, then it's not a bad idea.

- Not a big direction for how to grow the city outside of fixing some annoyances and fixing food deserts. Sioux falls is a city that currently leans on the Finance sector hard but has few of the nice Fin-tech or higher end banking jobs. There've been attempts at drawing in a bigger tech scene that have had middling success. Would you lean one way or another?

"I took a quick look at Mayor Paul’s plan before a Dakota News interview and it mostly sounds very nice.  I wish I had confidence in what I read but I don’t.  One big part of his plan was transparency in government.  Well then how about being transparent about bribery among city officials?   Two years ago the city’s ethics board reported city officials commonly accepted gifts of paid travel.  That’s illegal and I’ve been trying to get more information ever since.  And if he likes to meet with people why won’t he make an appointment with me?  It would be nice just to say hi let’s have an issued-based campaign.  

I don’t want to target TenHaken for personal criticism because he’s a man doing a job the way most people would.  The system is broken, not the people involved.  The system encourages me to doubt the sincerity of most politicians because expensive elections cause politicians to sell out and then we have a real mess.   

On a related topic, I’m sure people want to know what my plans are for city government.  I’ll mail an overview of my plans to SoDakZak and let him post my plans so we can get more conversation going.  My giant campaign flyer has an overview of my plans while my numerous PowerPoints (over 140) have more specific plans.  It’s all on DavidZforMayor.org

"Here's my perspective on the stuff I actually know enough to have opinions on. 

Pros:

- More Positive achievements in general than I'd expect. A few seem to be fluffed up and I'd like to see the actual effect these programs actually had, but not bad.

- More mental health space/assistance for people under the poverty line is a great thing to work on. The state of mental health in the US has been a severe issue since the 80s that is underreported on. 

- Infrastructure good, I'm all for fixing stuff and expanding roads and whatnot as the city grows.

Cons:

- We have loads of RL examples showing Austerity politics does not work. I'm not excited to see the future economic plan to be harder Austerity, especially if we're running a surplus this year anyway

- The Economic future for the city looks pretty Bearish compared to what I would have thought, but that's the breaks when it comes to being reliant on sales tax when COVID is still affecting people's shopping habits.  

- The tech plan for the future seems like it reads as ""we will do good tech stuff"" but isn't outlining a solid plan outside of cybersecurity efforts.

- Attacking Poverty while completely shunning handouts is a bad way to go about it. I'm all for opening up opportunities, but if someone's got no fixed abode, it's hard to see companies hiring them even with systems meant to help people get jobs. There really needs to be a balance, because companies aren't gonna take on the risk of getting someone in a stable position. There's gotta be a balanced approach. 

- Talent recruitment is all well and good, but I'm wary of the risk/reward of putting millions into such a program. I get that my field is an outlier for how subpar pay is compared to equivalent COL markets, but I think we need to look at the factors causing the brain drain to begin with, though many of those are way out of the Mayor of SF's control. I might be pessimistic because Des Moines has a high powered expensive municipal program made to bring in young professionals, and by all accounts it sucks at actually linking people with employers.

"Last year we had one get together at the beginning of the year where the entire league's new players took some infield and live BP on Augustana's field. Other than that it's pretty much a practice on your own thing. Last Sunday one of my teammates set up a get together and we practiced on Harmodon. 

Pretty much at your own pace sort of thing. If you want to practice more I'm sure you'd find guys in the league that would be willing to get together more often. If you're on a team that actually has practices you won't be demoted or benched for not going to practice. Last year we had games where we batted 12 and rotated fielding as we saw fit. Everyone pays so everyone plays type of mentality. 

I hope this helps and you sign up. We'd love to have you!
