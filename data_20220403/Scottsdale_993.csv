"I moved here from the midwest. I'll tell you the spots. So I started out in east mesa, terrible idea, its chain restaurants and grumpy mean old people. Gilbert is cool, that's where a lot of people your age go, lots to do but its still considered east valley (like a separate world)  club/coke crowd. You want to stay south of the 60 highway, north is ghetto white trash, if that's where you chose to land.

Next Biltmore. This is in uptown central phx, LOTS to do, great food, centrally located (highly suggest) I lived at Biltmore condominiums --check em out. Just not kid friendly, why I relocated more north. Be very careful looking in central phx...you don't want to be west of 7th Ave or south of camelback road. Gets sketchy. Be like million dollar homes and then two blocks over ghetto as hell. 

Scottsdale, still affordable lots to do, more of a party crowd, won't have to pay $200 for an uber because you live far lol. 

Desert ridge, Paradise Valley are considered good areas close to scottsdale, same with the lots to do. 

Just don't look west...like at all. Its trashy, theres a big dump out there and smells terrible ALL the time. Highest crime, terrible drivers who smash your car up, steal shit from you...theres streets you can't even drive down. Yeah...don't recommend. 

Try to find something close to work or you will hate spending hours in the car during all day long rush hr. (big plus if you work from home)

"Phoenix has a lot of good places, but it really depends on where you work, you need to look at your commute. You can get almost anywhere in about an hour. It really depends on what you like. If you like basketballor baseball, there are some stadium downtown. If you like football and hockey, there are stadiums in Glendale. If you like more upscale, Scottsdale is great for spending a lot. Hiking is pretty common here. I moved by south mountain to try to hike regularly and it is pretty central. Mesa is cheaper for houses at the moment. North Phoenix is growing crazy with the new semi conductor facility. Chandler has a lot of working professionals but don't recommend moving there unless you work there. Avondale is a nicer place than chandler but less going on. East Phoenix can be a little ghetto but that's dependent on where you move. Near the new battery and Samsung data center is probably nice. Most of the newer neighborhoods are dog friendly.

"I have a tip to share that I‚Äôve tried and have had success with. I had a lot of starling on my suet cages and they would empty it before woodpeckers show up. They still come, but it‚Äôs a lot less of a nuisance. I saw tips online‚Ä¶
**The two that worked best are:**

+ Using plastic/wax paper/cut plastic bags to block off sections of the cages making one feeding area. *It lasts longer and pest birds give up or can‚Äôt all gang up on the suet, emptying it quickly.*

+ Cut some printer paper/card stock to the size of a quart-sized ziploc. Stab a hole in the middle and pull the suet cage chain through all the way. 
*The plastic bag keeps birds off the top of the cage and prevents starlings feet from gripping for longer than 15-30 seconds at the available angles; leaving food for other birds that have feet made for holding on upside down/angled.*

*Also, bird watching in the afternoon rn with a podcast, prime relaxation.*",t2_7zvt9uwn,tg_777,0,1648754292.0,0,t1_i2vwtu1,i2vwtu1,False,tg_777,t3_tsmhoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tsmhoq/tips_for_bird_feeders_how_to_diversify_the/,Tips for bird feeders??

"So.. wife and I are in our early 40s, but definitely look more like early 30s. We like the IDEA of old town (a zillion cool bars all within a 1-mile radius), but we can't stand the club scene, and neither of us particularly like dancing. We also hate it when the music is so loud you have to scream in someone's ear to be heard.  Put another way -- we like nightlife for the chance to meet fun people, versus dance/club/grind/etc.  We also aren't huge fans of shoulder-to-shoulder crowds.

HOWEVER.. we do like places that are a little edgy. (Wife loves to wear a scandalous outfit and show off a little, for example). She loves the attention and flirting (I truly give no shits.. I know she's coming home with me.. We're both just there for a fun night out).  Divey is fine. We also like a speakeasy vibe. 

* We like Boondocks. It checks the boxes... But it's a LONG line to get in on a Fri/Sat. (Or is it? Are there tricks?)... though there's also a strong douche vibe there on weekends. (Though maybe that's all of old town?).
* We love a place with pool tables and/or corn-hole -- not because we're any good, but because it's a chance to be social.  We've tried The Rack, but it's not very social. (People go in with their group, play pool as a group, and leave as a group)
* Have never tried Coach House.  But that looks potentially interesting based on comments here.
* Patties is not the older crowd people in this thread say it is.. and it's pretty loud, and shoulder-to-shoulder.
* We do know there's a small swinger scene that travels around old town (3 Wisemen, as well as the upper-back of Waisted Grain).. But it's mostly just cocained out people who are after the loud club scene I described above.. not really our people.

And yes, it's possible that with these kinds of limitations, old town isn't our thing, I dunno.. what do you think?",t2_gyyks,brohamsontheright,0,1648748081.0,0,t1_i2vgn2y,i2vgn2y,True,Candymasterasian,t3_tsmqmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tsmqmi/i_am_a_scottsdale_nightclub_vip_host_ama/,"I am a Scottsdale Nightclub VIP Host, AMA",/r/Scottsdale/comments/tsmqmi/i_am_a_scottsdale_nightclub_vip_host_ama/i2vgn2y/,1,r/Scottsdale,0,1

I've only ever put nyjer into a hopper. Wild Birds sells a product called Bark Butter that's mix of suet, peanut butter, and meal worms, if I recall the ingredients correctly.

Boondocks, Wasted Grain (if you stay out of the upstairs back room), Gilligan's all make up a chill little area just south of the clubs. The real spot there is DJs, super low-key industry spot and the bartenders have a heavy hand, great place to grab a few before hitting pricier spots. 

Old Town Tavern usually has live music. Merkin, Scapegoat (can get loud at times), and Rift (South Scottsdale) all solid spots that feature wine and tend to be popular with groups of ladies.

"Insane how fast and dramatically things have changed. I got my first apartment in Scottsdale in 2013 as a 19 year old with another 19 year old. Both of us made $8 an hour at the Camelview Harkins and rent was $880 for a 2 bed 2 bath with utilities included in downtown. 

That's not even possible these days and I can't wrap my head around it. I'd expect some inflation but not to the degree that it is. It's fucked up that you can't find an apartment without a roomate for $1,400.

"I'm a **Scottsdale native** and think that most of the advice below is pretty good. Concerning the **Salt River**, however, my wife and a friend tubed it a few months back and said it was REALLY low. My wife and I are both members of the **Botanical Garden**, and I would point out that there are some pretty shady walks there (bearing to your right and passing through a small fence opening once you pass the entrance, will take you on a circle route through overhead cover, for instance; and the butterfly exhibit is cooled), though you might find the outdoor routes more ""hot and dusty"" as the morning turns to noon. Nonetheless, you can also make a lunch or brunch reservation at **Gertrude's**, an excellent airconditioned restaurant there, which is in the same building as the gift shop --a great place for souvenirs of your visit.  Other possible ""more cool in temperature"" venues around town include **SMOCA** (Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art), a tour of **Pueblo Grande** (an ancient Anasazi ""Indian ruin"" in Phoenix that boasts an excellent inside museum of items found there, coupled with a short outside walking tour of the ruins, so not too taxing in the heat). **Tovrea Mansion**, a spectacular historic home that many in the Valley call ""Birthday Cake Castle"" because its floors rise in a way that makes it resemble a giant wedding cake, is located very nearby Pueblo Grande (both of which are just off the freeway for easy access) and tours are fascinating and fun. If you have a youngster or two with you, the **Hall of Flame** is a **huge museum of firetrucks** all located inside, and airconditioned--not far from Pueblo Grande and the Tovrea Mansion! For indoor fun, you might also check out the **butterfly exhibit and aquarium** located just east of Scottsdale on the **Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community** (SRPMIC and Scottsdale share a border, so it really is ""right next door,"" depending on where you're staying in the city). If you are drawn to music or instruments, you would undoubtedly enjoy a visit to the ""world class attraction"" of  **MIM: the Musical Instrument Museum**, just west of Scottsdale in North Phoenix. Here you can easily while away a hot afternoon in airconditioned comfort, perhaps even enjoying a special performance--it may sound hokey, but the museum is quite large and modern, housing an enormous number of instruments from around the world, all on display as if they were artwork, many with optional recordings to listen to. Any and all of the venues mentioned here are easy to lookup online, so you can see what strikes your fancy and make reservations where needed. I would not recommend a desert tour, unless it's in an airconditioned vehicle during this time of year, however, for someone who is not a true ""Desert Rat"" --- BUT, you *could* get a nice taste of the desert by making a quick visit to **Hole-in-the-Rock**, where weather has worn a cave right through a stone outcropping known as a ""butte"" and and the hike up is scant minutes, with duck-filled lakes around the park. This is located right beside the Botanical Garden, and not far from the Hall of Flame! Whatever you choose to do, I hope you have the time of your life, here in my home town!  P.S.: If you get the chance to go outside after sundown that time of year, particularly if it's breezy, you'll not only love it, you'll be *shocked* to learn that it's 90-degrees out still, because it felt so sweet and balmy--many of my back East visitors are very pleasantly surprised by this!",t2_cqqfgstm,Ecstatic_Ad8577,0,1648450986.0,0,t1_i2esunr,i2esunr,True,alexxxx4,t3_tpyetn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tpyetn/is_it_too_hot_during_early_september_to_do_any/,Is it too hot during early September to do any outdoor activities including water activities?,/r/Scottsdale/comments/tpyetn/is_it_too_hot_during_early_september_to_do_any/i2esunr/,2,r/Scottsdale,0,2

"As someone in a similar situation for years now, the best thing you can do is report, report, report. It‚Äôs going to suck regardless, best to get it on file with the City, Code Enforcement & PD so there is a consistent record of the issues at the home to help the push for legislation, especially if we can‚Äôt afford to sue. 

First: Check Scottsdale‚Äôs rental map to make sure the home is registered at https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/codes/vacation-short-term-rentals & if not report to Code asap & they will get on them

Then: You can check construction permits & report unpermitted construction which occurs at these homes regularly. You can also report the home being used as an events center or sleeping more than 10 people,  which many of these homes do, to Code. Don‚Äôt hesitate to call police on the nuisance homes. Scottsdale noise ordinance starts at 10pm, but if it‚Äôs excessively loud or inappropriate (gangs/cursing/nudity) you can call whenever. They have defined a specific process to deal with them & the renters have paid to party so they‚Äôre not likely to be receptive to feedback. & Again, when you go to PD there will be a record of consistent nuisance behavior at the home, vs trying to go to a property manager or AirBNB who are making money on that party, not the neighbors. 
Don‚Äôt be shy about sending videos or photos of nuisance behavior to the local representatives, City council, the news etc.

"Those who think this guy sounds like a dick clearly don‚Äôt live near a short term rental. We have the exact same problems except we‚Äôre in our early 30‚Äôs. 

What people don‚Äôt realize is the impact short term rentals have on single family home inventory and prices, particularly in Scottsdale, and pricing out the American dream of home ownership for what used to be working class communities. I know young people who own 10+ airbnbs in Phoenix that they bought with mom and dads money initially and play golf every day. That doesn‚Äôt even consider the massive REIT‚Äôs that do the same thing at the institutional level. It is NOT a healthy trend for a city to have a meaningful percentage of homes that are only filled with vacationers on weekends in cool seasons. In the land of low density, Scottsdale will not experience healthy growth and maintenance if our communities evolve like this. Schools, roads, facilities and amenities will all suffer.

That‚Äôs the economic side of things, and then there‚Äôs quality of life. Last week it was literally 10 cars parked at the house blocking the cul-de-sac and our driveway. The week before it was someone playing basketball late at night on the court they built right next to our window to attract renters. The week before it was loud music and girls screaming at their pool at midnight on a Wednesday.

">Like 95% of bars and restaurants are pet free. Just avoid pet friendly establishments if it bothers you. 

Sadly that is not true anymore. I avoid dog friendly places.  I was just on a walk and saw this.  I wasn't eating anything.  I saw this and found it disgusting.  

>I guarantee you most servers at a dog friendly restaurant are petting the dogs and then running food on an almost daily basis so if you‚Äôre that worried about a dog on a counter I doubt the place is up your alley in the first place.

This is a health code violation.  Staff should be trained not to do this.   I appreciate how Phoenix Brewing Co handles it.  They have signs everywhere saying employees can't touch the dogs and outline the rules for being dog friendly.  More places should be like that.

"Scottsdale will be fine if you're just trying to get an idea of what the Sonoran Desert is like. Your post is kinda vague, but I'm assuming you're okay with hiking. Scottsdale has the [McDowell Sonoran Preserve](https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/preserve) and it's a great place to check out the desert up close in person. There is a north and south section. Use the Browns Ranch trailhead of the north section for a great hiking area and lots of flora without needing to do too much elevation (I find the Pima Dynamite Trailhead has more bikers which can annoy some folks). Grab a paper map at the trailhead, it can be a maze and most trail apps don't navigate the area well. Use the Gateway Trailhead of the south section if you want to hike with the opportunity for a lot of elevation, there's a very short walking path with informational signs about the desert if you don't want to hike too far (use Tom's Thumb Trailhead of the south section if you want a very steep trail to the top that is a 4.5 mile round trip).

It will be fucking hot, start as early in the day as possible. Be hydrated 12 hours before you go. Bring at least a liter or two of water with you. Wear sun protection, there is practically no shade. Know your fitness level and assume you'll get tired quicker than you do at home due to the heat, dryness, and sun exposure. Heat exhaustion will potentially effect you for days, ruining your trip. Heat stroke will potentially kill you, ruining your life.

Salt River Project election to draw thousands of voters to choose water, power leaders

All of this   
will get decided by about 13,000 people who have requested ballots.   
March 25 is the deadline to get a ballot. In 2020's SRP election, about   
6,000 individuals voted. Election day this year is April 5.¬†...

PIRG, a   
consumer group focused on health, safety and financial stability issues,  
 does not advocate for particular candidates in SRP elections, but does   
offer the utility feedback on a variety of issues, from power plant   
developments to customer rate plans and payment policies.

""Unfortunately, SRP‚Äôs arcane   
voting system automatically¬†deems renters ineligible to vote and also   
contributes to a miniscule percentage of ratepayers that vote for SRP   
leadership,"" Brown said. ""Eligible SRP customers should exercise their   
right to vote in the SRP elections to help determine the direction of   
their multi-billion dollar utility when it comes to their   
electric¬†bills, water and energy infrastructure, and related policies.""

SRP  
 races are notoriously difficult for outsiders to win because of the   
acreage-based voting system and the tradition of large land owners   
voting for people with ties to agriculture, often coming from families   
with ties to the formation of SRP.....

In years past, most   
incumbents on the board would not spend more than $500 on their races,   
according to finance reports filed with Maricopa County.

Four years ago a political action group from Chispa, which is affiliated with the League of Conservation Voters, even spent $100,000  
 to help its preferred candidates, which is a pittance for most   
elections but enough to make a material difference in SRP races. This   
year Sierra Club is endorsing the team of renewable-energy advocates   
seeking office.

Voters can request a ballot and find further details of the election over the phone at 602-236-3048 and online at www.srpnet.com/elections.  
 The website also includes a form to be included on the early-voter   
list. The deadline to request a ballot is 5 p.m. on Friday, March 25.   
Election day is April 5.¬†

The  
 power district has 14 board members. The first 10 are the same areas as  
 the water association, while the additional four are ""at-large"" members  
 who represent the entire territory. The at-large members¬†were added in   
the 1970s following criticism of the acreage-based voting, and they are   
elected on a one-vote-per-person basis, not acreage.

The solar advocates that have won seats so far represent these four   
at-large seats, though this year members of the ""clean energy"" team are   
gunning for acreage-based seats and endorsing challengers for the   
offices of president and vice president.",t2_ojyib,FTGremlin,0,1648093290.0,0,t1_i1w05yw,i1w05yw,True,vanderlinden,t3_thh12j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/thh12j/srp_election/,SRP election,/r/Scottsdale/comments/thh12j/srp_election/i1w05yw/,1,r/Scottsdale,0,1

"Unfortunately, an emphasis on local ingredients won't guarantee the absence of shellfish. There are shrimp farms in Arizona, and wild shrimp are routinely caught in the waters of the Gulf of California in the neighboring Mexican state of Sonora, so even many restaurants with a local angle serve shrimp.

My best guess is that you might be able to reach out to a restaurant like [FnB](http://www.fnbrestaurant.com/) and ask if they are currently serving any shrimp on their seasonal menu.

"Well, technically, it's illegal to have alcohol on the reservation (which is where Salt River Fields is, for those who don't know) and this limits your options.

You can bbq at a park that's located in the north-west corner of the intersection of Pima road and McDonald drive -- they even have some standing grills there. You might need a permit from the city to drink beer at the park, though -- I'm not sure.  But, off the top of my head, that's about the closest location I can think of, to Salt River Fields (SRF), where you might be able to actually tailgate. Any open area around the SRF, east of Pima road is reservation land, so it wouldn't work. And, most land west of Pima road is hardscape: residential or commercial real estate. I suppose, if you knew somebody who owned an office building, or perhaps just had an office that was west of Pima road, you might be able to make arrangements to tailgate in the parking lot of an office building there. But, again, I think you'd probably need a permit from the city to drink legally there. Scottsdale seems to be pretty picky when it comes to stuff like that. In any case, I wish you the BEST of LUCK!

"About 20 years i went to college in England; a classmate found out i was from the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, he told me it was way too hot when he visited here to hike.

Me: well you shouldn‚Äôt have hiked in the summer!

Him: but i visited in January!!


Conclusion: if you find it too warm when you get here, please dont hike lol!!

HYDRATE. For the love of God HYDRATE, even if you‚Äôre not doing anything strenuous. Our dry air is great but it sucks up moisture.

SUNSCREEN. We have lots of sunshine. I came back from England white as ghost (i still have pictures to prove it) and i spent a lot of time outdoors. Im of Mexican descent so it took a lot to get me that white! If you got light skin, you need it. And wear a hat since you‚Äôre a ginger!   You might want to bring one lightweight long sleeved shirt for the days too.

Make sure you don‚Äôt lose your wallet or cell phone. People are nicer in Scottsdale (we called it Snottsdale growing up) but while sometimes lost cell phones and wallets are turned into the police, most dont. Downtown Scottsdale is obviously a HUGE party area, so it comes with all the associated awesomeness and problems. So use common sense!

I dont know what party life is like anymore, but if you want a local hangover cure, you might brave menudo (the mexican american cure: it‚Äôs a stew made of hominy and cow stomach. I love it and my many relatives swear by it for hangovers. But it scares most people who have never had it). 

Indian tacos are delicious in general (Indian as in native american, thanks so much for the confusion Columbus).  They are either beans and/or meat in a frybread shell and topped like a regular taco. I think they are heavy enough to sop up alcohol! 

The Sugar Bowl in downtown Scottsdale is a ice cream parlor that hasn‚Äôt changed it‚Äôs menu since like the 60s. It‚Äôs adorable. You might find The Cornish Pasty company amusing: it‚Äôs run by some people from Cornwall and the only true pub i found outside England. They have 1 in downtown Scottsdale now. 

If you‚Äôre a nerd like me, you can visit the many museums we have, we have a botanical garden in Phoenix. There‚Äôs a Japanese friendship garden somewhere in Phoenix. 

Goldfield Ghost town out by the superstitions mountains is fun if you want a silly take on the wild west.

Karsens: hole in the wall bar, amazing food

The Mission: Fancy restaurant, but incredible Mexican food

Rusty Spur: you want that old west vibe? You found it

Craft 64: good pizza, great beer selection

Coach house: just a good bar

Blanco tacos: good sit tacos at a restaurant

Mr Mesquite: good takeaway tacos after a night of drinking

Snakes and lattes: not in Scottsdale, but fun board ge bar

Things to do during the day, depending on the exact month:

The desert botanical gardens are incredible

Top golf is always fun

Right now it's absolutely **beautiful** weather. I wouldn't worry about heat until it starts going 100+.

"Everyone here has given some great feedback!
We have amazing eats, outdoors activities, and everything else they‚Äôve said. 
$500k will not get you anything move-in ready in Scottsdale. Unless you want a condo. Have some off market homes that need fixing that would make great airbnbs on the Tempe/Scottsdale border. 
If your goal is to be close to nice restaurants, some night life, the outdoors, and within 40min of the airport, we have so many cities for you. 
One of the best parts of AZ is the accessibility to other cities/the airport. I could live in East Gilbert close to the San Tan Village Mall and still make it to central Phoenix in 40min, airport in 20-30 depending on traffic. 
As for short term rental markets, Scottsdale is the cream of the crop of course, but don‚Äôt sleep on other areas. We have clients with successful short term rentals in all cities, just depends on your property type and target demographic. And of course what kind of deal you could get on it. 
I recommend for sure keeping Scottsdale in the mix, but expand your options to Tempe, Chandler (inside the 101), Gilbert, and parts of Phoenix (uptown, Melrose, biltmore, Arcadia, even the Phoenix side of Paradise Valley Mall has been exploding). All of these markets can do you well if you buy right.

"Your happiness needs/lifestyle requirements are a great fit for the Scottsdale area. Like others on here, I‚Äôd recommend checking out old town and specifically areas around the Greenbelt. It‚Äôs basically a 15 mile stretch of public parks, golf courses, and green spaces connected together with amazing walkable paths along the entire stretch.

The best Dog Park I‚Äôve ever been to, [chaparral](htpps://goo.gl/maps/okLbYQ6AVR6eThBJA) Dog Park, is 1 mile north of old town along the Greenbelt. I have two dogs and my GF has one and I take all three there every day. That alone feels like a mini vacation daily, and walking there and back will get your steps in.

In my experience, the further you go away from old town, walkability drops off rapidly. Phoenix area outside of Scottsdale is primarily a car town with very busy roads and some places without sidewalks at all.

I‚Äôd also recommend coming here and visiting before making a decision on where you want to be. Starting out you could rent to get a feel for the place before buying. Unfortunately, the longer you wait to purchase, the higher the price you‚Äôll be paying because things in the Scottsdale area just keep rising.  I bought my home in August 2021, and (according to Zillow) it‚Äôs already appreciated 100K. D.M. me if you have other questions, I‚Äôve had family who lived in SLC, and I‚Äôve been in the Scottsdale area for three years now, transplanted from the bay area.

"Ok I‚Äôm thinking this means Old Town - if I‚Äôm wrong let me know.

Going North of Old Town gets you into Gainey Ranch and long time established upscale neighborhoods. The condos/apartments built at Lincoln and Scottsdale are maybe 3 or 4 years old so check those out.

If you go south into Tempe, they have been building new apts and condos for the last 10 years straight so you should have quite the pick.

I would go to Goog Maps, center on old town. Zoom out like 2 miles and type ‚Äúapartment‚Äù and find the top 5 with little to no reviews, those are probably your newest builds to check out first.

There is some really high end condo buildings down across from Fashion Square mall down there, Optimum, like $800k base entry if that is more what you are looking for.

"You are moving to a great location - super easy to get north to Sedona/Flagstaff (Pinetop is fine too, just go far out East to end of Shea) when weather is hot.

You are next to 2 great ""mall"" type areas, Deserty Ridge itself of course and then Scottsdale 101 a few miles down the 101.

If you come down Tatum and cut over to Scottsdale Rd just north of Thunderbird, you have Kierland (West side of Scottsdale Rd) and Scottsdale Quarter (East side of Scottsdale Rd) for high end eating, retail, Apple store, all that jazz.

Getting downtown for shows is maybe 20-25 mins, go West to 51, then straight into downtown. Easy Peazy

You chose a great location.

EDIT: The gentleman below that posted about how HOW THE CARS get and ALLERGIES was spot on. If you buy any car color other than white and don't tint the windows to legal limit, get ready to melt.

Also, he wasn't kidding, leaving your phone in the car, anything important, and then parking the car in the sun in the middle of summer actually runs a pretty good chance of melting or damaging the item.

We've also had two Teslas and they don't cool enough to keep the car comfortable while traveling in full Arizona summer heat. That sun penetrates the glass roof like you can't believe. It's very obvious that car was built in Southern California.

"Everything you need is very close to you!

Enjoy it‚Äôs a solid place to live!

You have good highway access.

One thing to be aware is many group sports take place closer to Tempe, which is just 30 minutes away.

Scottsdale quarter is expensive but good for date night. Get a fry‚Äôs card/grocery store memberships for gas prices.

Whether you want plants, art shows, golf, bookstores, you name it- right there!  

IKEA is 50 mins away btw.

Desert ridge is mostly teenagers and 40+. There‚Äôs a copy in Tempe if you want a more young adult crowd. There‚Äôs several major high schools close. 

Lots of good food. Indian food at bell road/Tatum, Krui Thai, mountainside fitness is next door-or go to Esporta-small gyms available also. Lifetime fitness location is top tier as well.

Tj‚Äôs pizza, barrows pizza
Filiberto‚Äôs 
Trader Joe‚Äôs.  


Personally desert ridge restaurants are a bit expensive, you can also walk the Reach, go to the MIM. 

Hockey/nfl is 45 mins out. Baseball 35ish. 
Mint has the best deals imo for dispensaries, maybe they will fall off, idk 2-1 stuff every week. 

For people butching about traffic- construction seems done so it should improve- finally can speed more. Cops are lenient with speeders here btw, I go 75-80 all the time. 

Desert ridge traffic is really not that bad. The entrances are limited but you will figure it out pretty quick. Barrio queen is godly Mexican food.

"Desert Ridge is where I grew up. It's a nice area, not as crazy upscale as parts of Scottsdale. More middle class families and young professionals. But it's still an awesome community with plenty of amenities. We definitely miss it since the entire family moved back east. 

It's nice having the hotel and golf course there. Get a bike because there are fantastic bike paths and really great sidewalks that make pedaling down to Desert Ridge shopping center easy (don't do this in summer unless it's early morning though). Pretty much everything you need is there or nearby. Desert Ridge complex also has nice little events and there's areas to congregate at like boccie courts, a splashpad, a big fireplace. They bring in musicians, art showcases, etc. It's not a terrible drive to get downtown for events from the area compared to other cities either. The 101 and 51 is right there too which is so convenient. Traffic backs up a little down by the shopping complex but you lived in VA anywhere near the beltway Phoenix traffic is child's play. 

For daily functioning the biggest thing you need to do is get sunscreens for your cars windows (completely blackout ones, not just the tinted shaded ones). Tinting the windows helps too. Always be sure to have water in your vehicles as well in case of break downs. 

If you have any kind of outdoor space of your own and are planning on using it in summer get some fans and consider a misting system. 

If you have pets, make sure you monitor their hydration too. 

Oh and get ready to eat In-N-Out burger regularly for about the first 6 months you're there once you discover it.",t2_csrqjtan,neonstarseed,0,1647838247.0,0,t1_i1hu1ba,i1hu1ba,True,lileggroll129,t3_tivjph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tivjph/moving_to_desert_ridge/,Moving to Desert Ridge,/r/Scottsdale/comments/tivjph/moving_to_desert_ridge/i1hu1ba/,1,r/Scottsdale,0,1
"Welcome to Phoenix! Everyone mostly covered the important stuff.

You are officially in North Phoenix and bordering North Scottsdale. The Desert Ridge area is wonderful and you've heard the worst regarding some traffic congestion, in particular Tatum Rd.

The Desert Ridge area does have everything you need from grocery (Albertsons), big box (Target), entertainment (Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble, Comedy Club, Copper Blues Live), some very good food spots from sit down to fast food (In n Out, Chipotle, Flower child, Barrio Queen, Thirsty Lion, Hulas, Ocean Prime). There aren't many specific bars, but Copper Blues and Whining Pig.

Nearby (5-10 miles) you have a few other options. 

- Groceries (Fry's Foods, Sprouts Farmers Market, Safeway)

- Bars & Restaurants (The Italian Daughter, Copper Mule, Spiga Cucina, Babbos, Barros, Tailgaters)

- Entertainment (Musical Instrument Museum, Penske Racing Museum, Harkins Movie Theatres, Bowlero)

What does being in North Phoenix mean for you?  Well, you're not in the heart of downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale. You're in the burbs im North Phoenix where you have some great ways out of town up North, and really good access to the rest of the valley. 

Old Town Scottsdale (Peak nightlife and high end restaurants, hotels, and shopping) - 25 mins

Downtown Phoenix (Suns/Diamondbacks stadiums, growing development with good restaurants, trendy events and experiences) - 30 mins

East Valley (Chandler, Mesa, Gilbert which have some similar areas to Desert Ridge) - 40-60 mins

West Valley (Cardinals/Coyotes stadiums, Casino, Westgate bars/restaurants) - 30 mins

Outdoors Lake/Rivers (Lake Pleasant, Lake Bartlett, Salt River which have kayaking, tubing, boating, fishing, etc) - 60 mins

Northern Arizona (Prescott, Cottonwood, Sedona, Flagstaff, Payson are all great northern Arizona cities/towns with awesome outdoors, cool weather, beautiful pine trees, wineries, breweries, etc) - 1-2 hours

Some ""hidden"" gems in the northern Phoenix area (just my opinion):

 - The Thumb BBQ - Amazing BBQ pit of a gas station/car wash

- The Whining Pig - Craft beer bar that has a ""hidden"" speakeasy attached back by the bathrooms for fancy cocktails

- Gin N Reel - Speakeasy hidden in the back of Stir Coffee Bar on High Street (right next to Desert Ridge) where the wall behind the pay phone opens for a 25-30 person secret bar with fancy cocktails

- Tikka Shack - Fast casual Indian spot that's fantastic, especially if you're unfamiliar with Indian food and want a nice easing into it, right at Desert Ridge

- Pork on a Fork BBQ - Hole in the wall BBQ in an industrial complex about 15 minutes west of Desert Ridge

- Escape Room 101 - A nice variety of escape rooms to mix it up and do something a little different

- Carefree/Cave Creek - Little town about 20 minutes north with craft shops, saloons, bull riding bars, and fun places to walk around, drink, or do some country dancing",t2_ck98dzw,PhxJeff,0,1647837055.0,0,t1_i1hs4ls,i1hs4ls,True,lileggroll129,t3_tivjph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tivjph/moving_to_desert_ridge/,Moving to Desert Ridge,/r/Scottsdale/comments/tivjph/moving_to_desert_ridge/i1hs4ls/,5,r/Scottsdale,0,5

For dining out and nightlife, there are some good spots in Desert Ridge like Barrio Queen and Yard House. To add to that, if you head a mile east, you've got City North (High Street) where you'll find more upscale options and a comedy club. My girlfriend and I visit that area a couple of times a month. Check out Moden Margarita or Humble Bistro and then pop into Blue Martini for the late-night crowd and great people watching.

As for Valley Fever, I wouldn't concern yourself with that. Be aware of it, but don't fret. I've been here for over a decade, know lots of people and have not met anyone who's ever contracted it and have only heard a story or two about anyone who has.

For real, don't leave anything in your car during the summer and get a windshield screen for when it's parked. Hot leather seats and steering wheels suck.

There is also a big car show at Westworld this weekend, so you might miss it.

There are also more car shows on the calendar.

If you do a Google search for ""Scottsdale car shows"" there are a few nearby car shows in Phoenix and Queen Creek next weekend.
