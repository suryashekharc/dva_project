"Blink is cheap, very clean, but busy. My routines have a couple compound lifts, several isos with free weights, declines for core, and only use machines for a couple accessory sets.

during absolute peak times (IME, 5-8 or 9pm) there can be a queue for the racks and benches up to twenty minutes that you actually have to be physically in line for. In off-peak hours it's easy to just ask how many sets someone has left and staying in low orbit doing isos. 

if you have extra cash, can only lift during peak hours, and really don't want to negotiate for a slot then you might want to look elsewhere; but my opinion is that Blink is a great low cost option without any hidden downsides.",t2_47614,EmeraldFalcon89,0,1647345945.0,0,t1_i0qmva9,i0qmva9,True,hypoxiany,t3_teh09f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushwick/comments/teh09f/gym_recommendations/,Gym Recommendations?,/r/Bushwick/comments/teh09f/gym_recommendations/i0qmva9/,6,r/Bushwick,0,6

"Esco's aren't by definition a scam (no clue about Family Energy though) and in some instances you can save money compared with Con Ed's prices, but definitely not always. Unfortunately, we basically have a monopoly with these utility companies Con Ed and National Grid (who just ran a fracked gas pipeline through North Brooklyn, including Bushwick, potentially contaminating our water supply and continuing the future of reliance on fossil fuels- and we are paying for it).

Best we can do is be informed and reduce our use both for financial and for environmental reasons.

"I fell for this yesterday (in my defense, my landlord’s office is down the hall and the ESCO woman said my bills were higher because I was being charged for more than one unit, which is a thought that has crossed my mind before, so it seemed plausible to me). She was REALLY nice! Her people skills were amazing, she definitely could’ve qualified for a much better job with a reputable company, the poor girl.

Anyway, I caught on during the final step, a confirmation call where they referred to her as a sales rep and then I told her to leave, but this was after I stupidly signed her phone.

Don’t be like me and stupidly sign anything. But if you do, these are the steps you should take:

Immediately after she left, I contacted ConEd through their live chat feature (couldn’t get a human on the phone) and they put a block on my account so my supplier can’t be switched to an ESCO. Then I did the same thing with National Grid. I was able to reach a human for NG by telling the robot message that I was calling about a scam. I told both companies that I was coerced into an agreement but that I want them to continue to supply my gas and electricity. They see this all the time, so they’ll know how to help.

Then I emailed all the email addresses I could find for Family Energy and told them to rescind the agreement immediately, because I couldn’t get through to a person by calling them either. Given their shady business practices, I wouldn’t be surprised if they just never answer the phone 🤷‍♀️

I did get an email back stating that the contract was rescinded without having to pay any cancellation fees - the contract says you owe a $100 fee to cancel after 3 business days, which is why I did it right away. I also plan on sending a letter to their office in Buffalo to state that I rescinded my agreement and it was confirmed via email, and I’ll be sending it through USPS Priority Mail with signature verification.

I’ll also file a complaint with the NYS Department of Public Services because Family Energy claims to be a regulated utility provider, but they are not. [Utility companies regulated by NYS can be found here.](https://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/0C2CE2BE1891DA5285257687006F394B?OpenDocument)

The thing that makes me laugh about this situation is that I was smart enough to figure out what to do and get out of this bullshit, but I wasn’t smart enough to just not answer my door in the first place. 😂 The irony is, I NEVER answer my door! 🤦‍♀️ and I never will again…",t2_452xillh,Thats_redditulous,0,1646833745.0,0,t1_hzyz5bc,hzyz5bc,True,ifeelpeachy,t3_t9qum8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushwick/comments/t9qum8/door_too_door_scammers_in_bushwick_beware_theyre/,Door too Door Scammers in Bushwick - BEWARE!

"The answer is hedging.

https://www.amny.com/business/con-edison-rolling-back-supply-charges-new-york/

> “Once each month, Con Edison forecasts the value of its hedge, whether positive or negative, and adjusts customer supply costs to account for those forecasted gains or losses,” Cawley explained to the PSC. “If actual prices differ from the forecast, in either direction, then Con Edison reconciles this difference by adjusting these costs in the following month.”

> Nevertheless, Cawley agreed that Con Edison needed to do something to ease that economic pain — so this month, the utility giant is rolling back its supply charge for full-service customers (those who are not on hourly pricing) by about 8.8 cents per kilowatt hour. This will apply to customers for their billing cycle beginning on Feb. 11 of this year.

"The answer is that natural gas prices in the Northeast experienced extreme price volatility. And natural gas prices directly affect the price of electricity. 

Voila.

https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/weekly/

> Two regions have experienced significant, sustained swings in natural gas prices since the start of November, caused in part by fluctuations in the weather and the resulting impact on heating demand. Especially cold temperatures for most of January and early February, along with other factors, had a particularly strong effect on natural gas prices at the Algonquin Citygate – a major pricing point for natural gas delivered to New England, which relies on natural gas for space heating more than most other regions. Natural gas spot prices at Algonquin Citygate have exceeded $20.00/MMBtu on 18 days since November 1 in response to cold weather and other contributing factors. The Algonquin Citygate price has ranged from a low of $3.50/MMBtu to a high of $28.04/MMBtu, and it has averaged $11.28/MMBtu since November 1.

Why is this so hard for some people to understand?

Not only do they not set the supply price, they also don't make any profit on the electricity supply. They buy the electricity and pass the cost on to you. They make *less* money when the supply price is high because when the supply price is high, people use less electricity. And when people use less electricity, their actual profit center, transmission, takes a hit.

"IANAL but I did once have a shit landlord here in NYC. IIRC when you aren’t offered a new lease renewal you remain under lease holdover until eviction, so the terms of your old lease apply temporarily . To avoid an eviction you might choose to move out when the landlord notifies you of his intention not to offer a renewal. Or you can stay and fight. Then things get complicated. I recall he has to give a reason why. For example if it is less than six units he can evict to use your apartment for a family member. There are specific rules. Maybe he can prove you paid late consistently. But to evict you for no reason?

"I've found myself in a similar boat and was shocked to find there's basically no legal recourse in this situation for renters non-regulated buildings. All you can hope to do is negotiate on a personal level.

Did your landlord give you a reason why they won't renew? If they're adamant on you leaving you could def ask for a month-to-month arrangement while you figure out your next moves. They'll likely do what they can to avoid the legal hassles of having to force you to leave. 

As it happens our state senator representing Bushwick, Julia Salazar, is actually pushing legislation that would address this. It's known as 'Good Cause' anti-eviction legislation and it would prohibit landlords from refusing a lease renewal unless the lease was in some way violated.

You’re in bushwick and musicians - look into practice spaces that you can double up to build as a portable recording studio as well. They’re not that expensive at the monthly rate and open 24/7.

INGREDIENTS  
1 cup Basmati rice   
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped  
1/4 cup oil  
6 oz. tomato paste  
1 small chicken (Cornish hen better).... skinned and cut-up  
If you don’t want to bother with this, you can use boneless chicken…but the Cornish hen gives it better flavor  
1 tea sp. whole cumin seeds  
2 cinnamon sticks  
1 tsp turmeric  
RECIPE:  
Wash rice in cold water 5, 6 times  
Soak rice for about 30 minutes in 2 cups of water and 1 heaping tea-spoon salt.  
Heat oil in a large, deep pan. Add 2 sticks cinnamon and 1 tsp cumin...be careful, these spices make the oil splutter. Saute for 1 minute  
Add chopped onions and cook till light brown, but not burnt.  
Add tomato paste and 1/4 cup water. Mix well  
Add 1 tsp salt and 1 level tsp turmeric. Cook 5 mins.  
Add chicken and 1/2 cup water. Mix well. Cover and cook on low for 15 mins. May have to stir once or twice.  
Now add the rice and water and mix well. Cook till water is almost gone.

"Hey everyone,

About a month ago I posted about having a big silly trebuchet completion celebration on this sub. Our into meeting took place a couple weeks ago and was a resounding success! There was a silly PowerPoint, many friends were made, and lots of folks signed up to build lil trebs. I was actually astounded by the number of people who came from Reddit. 

Next week we’ll be holding another information session and progress meet up to chat about everyone’s progress at 101 Wilson. You’re also more than welcome to come as a first timer! The actual competition will take place in March and there will be some important updates coming this week.

101 Wilson, 7:30pm, February 24th in Bushwick!

IP was 2GW. The combined gas and dual fuel capacity in NY is 24GW. NY peak daily loads in January are around 20GW.  Even if IP was still operating a 500% increase in gas prices in a month was going to cause a dramatic spike in supply costs.

Who is we? Because you implied earlier that you know for a fact that Con Edison is involved in hedging the market months out. And I know for a fact that they do not. Posting some random Google results doesn't mean that you have any knowledge of how Con Edison and the NYISO operate.

You're not a very good energy analyst then.

You see how natural gas prices went from $5/million therm to $25/million therm in December? And electricity went from $50/megawatthour to $200/megawatthour at the same time?

That's the reason why.

"> When Con Ed installed a smart meter, they charged me an extra $2,500+ because the installer forgot the transfer the reading of the old meter over to the new one. 

There is no reading transfered to the smart meter when they install it. The smart meter starts at 0. They only take the final reading of the old meter.

In my case, the business on our ground floor whose basement had all the meters wasn't open for a year so they literally didn't read the meter that entire time. I ended up getting charged for the entire period because they had no meter readings. The first three months they estimated my usage as zero. I'm guessing the previous tenent also wasn't being charged. The only reading they got was the final reading when they installed the smart meter.

So I called them up, explained the issue, and the adjusted the bill to charge me for my average usage for those three months and nothing previous.

Which brings me to my point: Like 90% of Con Ed billing issues are because they aren't given access to the meters. If they don't read your meter, your bill is going to be fucked up. Of course, when they're done installing smart meters this shouldn't ever be a problem. Pretty sure Brooklyn is entirely done at this point.

"A few months ago I received a $600+ bill after a meter reading. This shook me because of the meter reading... this couldn't be wrong, correct? I had lived in my Bushwick 1BR loft for about 4 months and every bill was around $60-80 max.

So I called bullshit. Literally. I called Con Ed and explained that this was insane, that my previous apt (which was a shared 3BR) never even came close to having a bill that high. Luckily the customer service rep I got was super friendly. I got the sense that this wasn't the first time they experienced this. She asked me to take a photo of the meter and send it back.

So... I asked my super to take a photo for me, and what do you know!? Turns out it was an INCORRECT METER READING and they reduced the bill to $80.

Do you want to understand the issue or do you want to stay ignorant? It's your choice.

They buy the cheapest power available on the market. There is nobody cheaper to buy from. That's how it works.

> Who is enforcing the supply charge?

Nobody is ""enforcing"" the supply charge. The NYISO operates the marketplace for wholesale energy. Utilities like Con Edison purchase energy on the open market. Right now, there isn't enough natural gas to go around so prices are extremely high. And that means high costs to consumers. 

> 
>What is the NYISO?

>The NYISO is the New York Independent System Operator — the organization responsible for managing New York’s electric grid and its competitive wholesale electric marketplace. We do not generate power or own transmission lines, but we work with power producers, utility companies, and stakeholders to provide power to meet New Yorkers’ electricity needs on a daily, hourly, and minute-to-minute basis. We are committed to a fair, transparent market system because it helps us deliver the lowest cost wholesale power solutions.

> The NYISO is charged with reliably operating New York’s power grid, meeting the most stringent standards in the nation, under strict regulatory oversight. The NYISO plans the power system for the future, over one, five and ten-year studies, to maintain long term reliability, reduce congestion on the transmission system, and meet public policy needs calling for new transmission, such as lines to bring renewable resources to customers.

Con Ed has nothing to do with the increase in the supply charge. They buy electricity at the lowest price it is available from the energy producers.

Natural gas prices are through the roof which is the entire reason that people's bills are high.

"> There's just no transparency regarding who they buy it from and why they chose to buy it from that supplier this month.

The issue is that you don't understand the first thing about the energy market and don't even understand what you're complaining about. 

What ""transparency"" are you looking for exactly? Con Edison doesn't have ""a supplier."" They have hundreds of suppliers. Every power producer that is hooked up to the grid is a supplier. They all put bids onto the energy market and then utilities like Con Edison buy their supply at whatever price the supplier bid at. And as you can imagine, utilities like Con Edison buy the cheapest electricity first. 

The clean energy suppliers you're referring to are called ESCOs. They're not actually the suppliers. They buy energy on the market just like Con Edison does. They basically just take over the job of buying electricity that Con Edison usually does for you. Con Edison just buys the cheapest electricity they can find, but you don't *have* to do it that way. They could just buy clean power. But since clean power is already cheap and there isn't enough, most of the clean power ESCOs don't actually buy clean power, they buy clean energy credits. 

ESCOs on the whole are scams. They use promo rates that expire and then stick you with massive cost increases. They often use variable rates that stick you with massive bills during peak usage periods. In the long term they're always more expensive than sticking with Con Ed.",t2_a44va,cocktails5,0,1644071789.0,0,t1_hvp9kh1,hvp9kh1,False,Adventurous-884,t3_skqhl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushwick/comments/skqhl6/coned_bill_hike_clean_energy/,ConEd Bill Hike & Clean Energy,/r/Bushwick/comments/skqhl6/coned_bill_hike_clean_energy/hvp9kh1/,1,r/Bushwick,0,1
"> the unannounced and uncontrolled hiking up of prices

Con Edison delivery prices haven't changed. Con Edison supply charges are not set by Con Edison. They buy the cheapest electricity on the market. 

> and no agency to monitor the ongoings at ConEd

The Public Service Commission is literally the agency that monitors and regulates Con Edison. Con Edison can't increase their prices without PSC approval and you're more than welcome to complain to the PSC about anything you want to.

You can see all of the real-time energy pricing here:

"Electricity is generated by both renewable and fossil fuel sources and then sold to local power distribution companies like Con Ed. Prices fluctuate similar to other fuels like gasoline or natural gas. Con ed says ""We buy the energy you use in the competitive, wholesale supply market. We pass our costs on to you, without taking a profit—what we pay, you pay.""  
https://www.coned.com/en/accounts-billing/your-bill/how-to-read-your-bill

The competitive market here refers to power producers competing to generate electricity at the lowest cost to be bought by utilities like con ed who pass the costs on to ratepayers. You may be able to see who is winning these autions by diving in to PSC or ISONY documents.

 So by definition, a standard con ed account will be selling you power at market rate. That's why most ESCOs have a hard time delivering on their promises of lower prices. Renewable energy can cost a premium due to a variety of factors around its availability such as proximity/transmission infrastructure, and natural variations in wind/solar/hydro output. ESCOs may also have undesirable contract requirements where you can't cancel the service without a penalty, so people don't like them. There are some customer protections in place from NYS. More info here: https://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/DAA1CF3080DA35F685257FCB004EBB59

 If your supply bill spiked suddenly...that seems unusual. I haven't seen any news about big rate spikes. Usually summer electricity is most expensive. Are you sure you are not already part of an ESCO? Or using alot more electricity than usual?

Nyc.gov says ""NYC's electricity today is mostly generated by burning fossil fuels, representing about a quarter of the city's total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). By the end of 2021, we expect our local electric grid to be approximately 85% powered by fossil-fuels."" https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/our-programs/energy.page

So unless you buy renewable energy from an ESCO you will be burning mostly fossil fuel based electricity.

Hope this helps! I for one am looking forward to our renewable energy future. I just hope the energy policy will be strong enough that electrification won't hurt consumers wallets.",t2_fidib,Turkish_Starwars,0,1644029003.0,0,t1_hvnem86,hvnem86,True,Adventurous-884,t3_skqhl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushwick/comments/skqhl6/coned_bill_hike_clean_energy/,ConEd Bill Hike & Clean Energy,/r/Bushwick/comments/skqhl6/coned_bill_hike_clean_energy/hvnem86/,2,r/Bushwick,0,2

To round out, I also started going to gym partly for mental health reasons. I sort of look at it as a place to hangout at and enjoy my time while doing healthy activities.

"Hey, everyone! I posted a few weeks ago about doing a big dweeby trebuchet building contest and party in Bushwick and tonight is the night of the introductory meet up! It’s just an information session and intro the contest so all you need to bring is a sense of childlike wonderment and an appetite for soup, because there will be soup. All are welcome! 

Here’s a little article Bushwick daily did about it: https://bushwickdaily.com/community/have-a-primal-urge-to-see-things-fly-through-the-air-join-bushwicks-first-catapult-club-at-101-wilson-bar/

More info can also be found on the IG: @the_great_trebulation

EDIT: I wish I’d taken more pics but here’s one from the back of the bar of the presentation. It went great! The next meet up will be February 24th to discuss progress!
