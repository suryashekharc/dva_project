"First off please don’t think of my previous comment to bash you or anyone else. It’s just insurance is bullsh!t and awful for the end user.

I totally understand how expensive it is. Friends have gone through dental school and one finish dental school and now endodonics and it blows my mind how much it’s cost him to get into a practice.

I’m also in the boat of my wife starting medical school so that’s very pricey too. The big reason I’m excited for my wife to get into being a D.O. Is that she wants to help the under represented females that don’t get the same care as others based on income, ethnicity, etc…

I just wish more dentist/companies could rally and “overthrow” how awful dental insurance is in the sense of cost and the poor yearly allowance when they make so much money off of premiums and all that.

"thank you for the comments! even in the best of circumstances, holding your jaw open for that long is just tiring so I totally get that it's not the most thrilling nor comfortable environment.

**tl;dr:** insurance sucks, dentistry is expensive, building a dental office is expensive, we hope to find a better way.

&#x200B;

we're new to the business side of things but we're doing our best to figure out the balance between 3 scenarios:

1. **Accept all insurances. S**ounds amazing but due to the many rules, restrictions, maximums, etc. (the goal of the insurance industry to ***not*** pay aka they profit) we need to hire experienced insurance coordinators during a massive workforce shortage. Insurance companies have historically lowered their reimbursements over time and even with the past few years, PPE and supply chain shortages, they continue to lower their reimbursements and make it harder for dental offices to get reimbursed. So as a dental office being reimbursed less (can range up to 40-60% less), we need to make up for it by seeing more patients/increasing volume and doing as much treatment as possible which leads to patients feeling like just another number in the dental chair. This is not what we want patients to feel in an already anxiety, uncomfortable environment.
2. **Accept no insurances** and work directly with patients on in-house membership options, payment plans, etc. This grants us the time to spend as much time as possible with each patient, review options to ensure that everyone feels heard, and that we fully understand the expectations and goals of each person with the best quality materials. However, without insurance, dentistry becomes unaffordable for so many people who turn toward neglect and delaying preventative care visits. This leads to small problems becoming larger problems, limited options, infections/abscesses, loss of confidence and the ability to simply eat and speak without pain, and a diminished quality of life. (sighs)
3. Somewhere in between the 2 above which is the balance we hope to find...

dentistry is expensive -- no doubt. I'll also share that dental school is expensive (national average debt is \~$270,000) and building a practice (aka a small hospital) is expensive. Oh my gosh.. if you thought having Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, etc. subscriptions are expensive, we've already projected \~$15,000-20,000 per month for all the recurrent subscription services on top of rent, bank loan, barebones staff, website. And I'm still pretty sure we're missing random things like landscaping haha that we haven't thought about yet. Of course this doesn't include supplies, lab fees, insurance (haha), and all of the amenities we hope to provide our patients.

Allllll that being said, it's helpful to understand what insurances are popular because we truly do want people to feel like they have access to quality care and to maximize the benefits they have so again, thank you for everyone submitting a response.

Those are super-simplified definitions of communist and technocratic, and the people running Nextdoor can surely hold to the values of communism or technocracy.

"Explanation: First you called a company communist and technocratic. This shows you don't understand the correct definitions of those two words. Which by definition, means you are ignorant about them.

Having fully displayed your ignorance you try and jump on the symantics of me calling the app privately owned. I was referring to ownership (group of private citizens) and not being owned by the government. Because in that context, they needed to be owned or controlled by the government in some way to apply to the correct definition of communism of technocratic. Then you called me ignorant for not saying ""publicly traded"". Which was ironic since you already displayed ignorance yourself.

Communism and Technocratic are concepts on how to structure and run governments. One is a way to distribute wealth evenly across all citizens and the other is how and why leaders are put into position. They can't apply to privately owned businesses (publicly traded is still private if there is no government funding or control).

You being banned for violating terms of service isn't censorship. You agreed to the companies terms when you used the app. Freedom of speech only applies to the government being able to imprison you for speaking against it. It doesn't keep a private business from kicking you out, nor does it protect you from getting fired from your job for posting something on social media. The exception is that business can't do it based on gender, sex, race, etc (whatever the rest of the law covers).

"Also, to address your question about it not affecting property taxes... well, that's the Obi-Wan answer.  It's true from a certain point of view.

We have a variety of bonds which are being serviced out of our property taxes at any given time, and over time bonds get paid off, so theoretically our property taxes would reduce.  However, since there's an ongoing need for new projects and such, they tend to replace retiring bonds with new ones, but they try to keep the millage rate (the rate we pay per 1000k of value) about the same.

K2 happened nearly ten years ago and several kids had permanent damage and death in some cases just in OKC. Minors are especially vulnerable bc they need a third party to purchase for them, or they purchase off the black market both increase the likelihood of tampering. Fetanyl is addictive, addiction is good business. Plus, they could have been supplied with doses in order to make it easier to harm them (robbery, sexual assault).

They want you to come to their home on Thanksgiving at 3 am and then bitch about every single little detail of you even being there and then not pay their bill. I had extremely high goals with plumbing, starting a business, donating 1/4 of my earnings to multiple outlets. But society has really ruined that since this whole ""covid"" thing. People have completely lost their humility and appreciation of everything outside of themselves, and it's disgusting. I truly was in love with my job, I loved learning new products, I loved spending time with the elderly customers in their homes; knowing I'm the only person they've probably spoken to all week. But the amount of dishonest, scummy, self-centered rejects outweighed all of that. Now I'm playing with dogs all day, learning how to make them look nice and healthy and not having to be in disgusting peoples homes who don't want me there in the first place.

"I grew up in Keller, TX and lived in the Fort Worth area until 25 when I moved to Edmond, OK 3 months ago. Some of my observations:

1. Homes in Edmond are much cheaper than TX. You can get the same house for about half the price in OK. If I recall, Frisco is a nice area, so the prices for homes will be above average. Texas market is nasty right now. Moving to Edmond I got a house with 50% more square footage (not counting garage or backyard) than my apartment in Texas, and I pay about 33% less (that includes home insurance, mortgage insurance, mortgage and escrow).

2. OKC traffic is better than DFW traffic.
I have not driven around OKC a ton during rush hour, but what I have seen is better than DFW’s situation, especially the Dallas side which has it worse than Fort Worth and charges for most highways, too.

3. OK charges taxes on groceries, TX does not. This price can sneak up on you over time with accumulation, so plan accordingly for that 8% add-on.

4. Edmond has a nice assortment of stores and services nearby, just about anything I need is no more than 10 minutes away, it’s pretty incredible, unsure if Frisco has that same blend of suburban and business. 

5. TX overall political climate leans closure to conservative, whereas Edmond gravitates towards the liberal side that you often see in dense urbanized areas such as OKC. 

6. Texas doesn’t do a state income tax, so expect much higher property taxes in exchange.

I personally have enjoyed Edmond more, my reasons being:
The traffic is not as bad, the cost of living is notably less than Texas, the location is a very nice one in terms of proximity, taxes are more balanced out, and most of the highways are toll-free.

Good luck making your choice,

I bought a 2200 sqft house in Edmond in May for less than $250K. At that price I kept being over bid even though I was bidding cash and over asking price. I like the south eastern quadrant.

"With that housing budget you'll get a lot of house, even in Edmond, and you really won't be a bad neighborhood wherever you go (and there really aren't any bad schools in Edmond).  I'd focus on convenience.  Edmond is a great place, but the traffic can be frustrating, and if you're having to cross through Edmond every single day for work it can get old.  I like being within a mile or two of a highway.  There are also areas of Edmond with plenty of shopping and retail, but some areas, especially in that price range, that will lead you really wishing there were some better grocery options in North Edmond.

If you like woods and rural, I'd look in far North East Edmond.  That's a great growth area, and where the city is putting in a lot of focus.  

The core of Edmond is great, but land is expensive there, but there are still plenty of options in your price range.  That gets you close to downtown, Hefer park, UCO and such, but the traffic in that area is rough, especially during school.

I like west Edmond.  You have multiple N/S options (Portland, Kelly, Santa Fe) which aren't *too* terribly bad to drive (although they can get backed up), the schools are great, and you can get into the city pretty quickly.  There are also more options in terms of grocery shopping, and access to the better retail amenities available along the Memorial corridor in North OKC.",t2_h8nm4,bubbafatok,0,1639672363.0,0,t1_hosptsu,hosptsu,True,[deleted],t3_rhsd9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmond/comments/rhsd9h/considering_moving_here/,Considering moving here!,/r/Edmond/comments/rhsd9h/considering_moving_here/hosptsu/,9,r/Edmond,0,9

"That's a solid budget for Edmond. Anywhere in Edmond is good, there aren't any places that would be bad with houses in that budget. Schools are great. Edmond has one of the best soccer complexes in the state (for rec and classic). There is also an area on the west side of Edmond that you can live in Edmond, have cheaper OKC utilities, and if you wanted, Deer Creek schools. They are a great school district too, just smaller than Edmond so kids would be competing in 4a instead of 5 or 6a (depending on the sport) in Edmond.

"Locals have come to believe that the south OKC metro is more likely to get a tornado than the north metro, especially Edmond.  This has been true for at least 20 years, but may not prove to stay this way in perpetuity.  

Oklahomans have a fantastic warning system in place. Days in advance you will hear the weather forecasters bringing up enhanced risk days and then it will be “the day.”  During that day, awareness will be high among anyone you talk to. If you are still oblivious, typically your warning will be 10-20 minutes with the siren system we have in place telling everyone to seek shelter. Most people around here will be glued to the tv to make sure the path of the tornado isn’t going through their neighborhood.  Also, when I’ve been in the path of a tornado (only one time in 43 years) before my friends and family start sending me messages about the incoming tornado.",t2_2wqw0n7b,okie1978,0,1638759173.0,0,t1_hnetpg4,hnetpg4,True,Gettysburgboy1863,t3_r9ofom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmond/comments/r9ofom/any_big_tornadoes_in_edmond/,Any big tornadoes in Edmond?,/r/Edmond/comments/r9ofom/any_big_tornadoes_in_edmond/hnetpg4/,3,r/Edmond,0,3
"This is not true at all south side gets it way worse. In the last ten years I have seen one medium sized tornado near edmond. In that time I have seen dozens go through Moore/Norman.
