"**[The Beaverton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beaverton)** 
 
 >The Beaverton is a primarily online Canadian news satire publication, based in Toronto, Montreal and Whitehorse. It features news stories, editorials, vox populi and other formats (such as university reviews) whose structure and layout mirror those of conventional newspapers but whose content is contorted to make humorous commentary on Canadian and world issues. The publication was founded in 2010 by Queen's University alumni Luke Gordon Field, Alex Huntley and University of Toronto graduate Laurent Noonan (1982–2014).

"I never would have thought an anodyne post about an opportunity to see a retro space opera movie on the big screen would devolve into a bun-fight about the ""acceptable"" terminology for a resident of Lethbridge.  ""Kudos"" for missing the point of the post and hijacking the thread for language policing purposes.

While I never should have bothered to engage, here I am.  ""Lethbians"" is a term I've never heard anyone over the age of 35 utter except with a sigh and/or an eye roll.

"If you're not fenced in deer will be a problem - in a backyard it's fine. I haven't had a problem with rabbits or squirrels, but I guess they could be an issue.

The wind isn't actually a huge deal, you just have to keep on your watering because the soil dries out quickly, and some sprinklers don't work as well because the water just blows into your neighbors yard. I'd aim for soaker hoses or sprinklers that shoot low to the ground. Mulching your garden beds can help too, but it's not absolutely necessary.

The average last frost is May 25th, so common wisdom is to keep plants inside until May long weekend.

"We had Airtech do ours but through their collaboration with Costco.  We ended up getting $750 back on a Costco Cash card.  They often have an end of an aisle setup at Costco and you may have to inquire when Costco will have their next bonus cash back offer.

A suggestion.... don't cheap out on AC equipment.   AC compressors are rated by floor space for cooling.   If you get an undersized unit to save on money, it will run much longer to get to the desired temperature and shorten its lifetime over getting the next size up.   Also don't forget that heat rises and cold drops, so don't count the basement as floor space for cooling.   The colder air will get there anyway unless you close off your basement with a door.

One last thing I remembered, I promise.  Think about where the outdoor unit will be around the house.  They do make noise and if you run it at night, make sure it is not near a bedroom.

Okay, only one more in case you don't do this already.

"There's been seven EDs I believe. Three were hired after they finished school. Three were community members. And now a grad student. Two of the community members were UofL grads. 

While the outgoing ED has a voice in the hiring, the board makes its selection based on their goals. I'm very excited to see what the new ED does. I'm hoping it includes adding grad students to LPIRG. There's funding available to levy paying students and this could be a boon to grad research.

"Various whistleblowers have leaked this info out several times. For example:

*""Michael Bates represents both Phillips and a woman who accused a retired LPS inspector of sexual assault. Both of his clients received anonymous whistleblower letters in June regarding discussions within the service.*

*""In one of the disclosures, there is a suggestion of a potential plan of retaliation against a named member of the professional media as well as a sitting member of the legislative assembly of Alberta for what can be inferred as \[them\] having sought public accountability of the Lethbridge police service,"" Bates said at a Lethbridge Police Commission meeting on Wednesday night.""*

Another later story:

*""Three officers also recently pled guilty to misconduct and two others planned to retire for their roles in circulating inappropriate* ***memes***""

Highlight is mine. There have been multiple leaks that the ""memes"" included Shannon Phillips and journalist Megan Grant, with violent and sexual imagery. It's all vague reporting because the police are extremely opaque in this and reporting on it (as Megan Grant did) opens you to retaliation, harassment, and surveillance - like when they posted their surveillance photos of Shannon to right wing Facebook groups

**17** women recently came forward to allege sexual harassment, bullying, assault, and blackmail in the department, so it isn't like this doesn't have legs. We'll never know because the investigations are all kept tightly under wraps, but somehow every time info leaks out it's the scariest possible shit. We're a pretty small department so when you see almost 20 women come forward with this stuff, and you see that they had **6** civilian staff on stress leave **at one time** from the harassment...

*""Jane found herself being harassed, too. Once, she had a sergeant ponder aloud to her whether he could get suspended with pay should he grab her breasts.*

*There was also the time another officer commented on her underwear. Or when an officer told her he always wanted to ""go there.""""*

&#x200B;

Another woman staffer:

*""Her biggest issue at LPS was a staff sergeant who she alleges, over the years, accused her of having a mental illness and blackmailed her with a failing performance review he had written...*

*On several occasions, Alice says she refused to share personal information after he'd dug into her Facebook page. That's when he accused her of having a mental illness.""*

This department is a garbage fire wrapped in shit and with the constant avalanche of allegations if even a fraction of it is true it would be enough to get any ordinary citizen indicted.

It's interesting to me that you looked at the one article, didn't immediately find anything on the one thing I said and brushed over the surveillance of Shannon, including 8 different unauthorized database searches and surreptitious photos taken of her and other community members she interacted with **that were posted online to Facebook groups to target her**.

"How is this decision ""escaping consequence"".  The appeal specifically alleged the consequences (which happened) just weren't serious enough in the complainants opinion.  They have a right to present evidence and argument about why in front of an impartial tribunal.   That is the rule of law.   The alternative is torches and pitchforks.  

As for the ""monopoly on violence"", interesting but I think a bit of a red herring.  But I'll engage....there is no monopoly.  Violence occurs in lots of non-police contexts.  You are talking more appropriately about the use of ""state sanctioned"" violence against residents (as opposed to the military which uses state sanctioned violence outside out borders - at least ordinarily).   You haven't laid out precisely how you see that as relevant here. Violence wasn't used in this case.  It isn't a case about excessive force is it?

"When it comes to the drivers test  here is the 3 tips I give.

 A) where there is  almost always 2 answers that are completely incorrect. So then you can choose between 2.

To turn right from a two-way road onto another two-way road, what should you do?

a swing wide to the left before turning

b Stay in your turning lane

c Turn into the left lane

d Do all of the above.

So C is wrong as you're turning right, because of that D is wrong.

Left with A and B, so think would you swing the car wide to turn right? No so then you would just choose C

&#x200B;

B) All are right so choose the most correct, this is where it may get tricky as the answers can be similar. For example 

You must signal when you are  
a pulling out from a curb

b changing lanes

c turning

d all of the above

"Hahaha in the london road area I had my truck broken into and all my work tools stolen, and then a year later my truck was stolen which had all my now 1 year old replacement tools. Then  a year after that had someone come in through our back door. They very politely left when they saw us though.

In Sunridge a coworker has had people break into his truck so many times they wrecked the lock on the passenger side. Each time they couldn't get the lock to open so just smashed the passenger window but over repeated attempts with a flat blade it screwed it. He recently had someone drill out his sheds door lock. They managed to steal... about $20 in soil testing chemicals. 

Near the hospital my buddy has had his truck broken into a few times but the last time they decided to try to steal the truck itself by hotwiring it. All they managed to do was destroy the lock/ignition and wiring. Requiring a $1k fix.

My other buddy lived in Hardyville for a decade, dirtbike say outside the entire time no problems. Later loved to London road, also left it unchained in his backyard for 3 years. No problems.

In West highlands my brother had his Volkswagen remote lock hacked by gang members down from Calgary. Apparently a regular occurrence according to the cops. When taking the car up though they hit the ditch near Diamond City going 150km/hr. They torched the car to hide the evidence. It made the news at the time.

"I'll never understand the shortsightedness of people.  

Investments in addictions and mental health pay off in many ways...but because that money isn't going to corporate handouts or text cuts for the rich, it's going to the wrong people.  

Something as simple as easy access to primary healthcare saves tens of thousands a year.  Catch an infection early enough that it's a 7 day course of antibiotics (that costs under $20) instead of requiring an ER visit ($400 at minimum), surgical debridement ($2500+) and inpatient treatment ($5000+).  All in all a visit from me, with meds, usually runs the province about $100.  Infection leading to amputation of a minor digit, $22,500 (or more, depending on physical therapy and rehab time).  

And before I hear the chorus (per usual) of ""What about our seniors?"", well, sure, we also see patients in lodges, supportive living and even long term care.  Patients from the cancer center....yup, we see lots from the Jack Ady and Tom Baker.

"I am biased towards places that have people that are consistently happier and healthier. Japan has a ton of excellent examples, in fact in my experience their public transit is better even than Europe's. Europe is just more culturally similar to us, so they make a better starting point for discussion.

EVs are better than ICE vehicles, no argument there, but they do little for the safety aspect, and they have the added negative of being heavier, so our already unsustainable car infrastructure wears out faster. Batteries are also a significant cost that can be largely avoided using light rail or overhead lines on transit. I think EVs have a place, but just replacing cars with slightly better cars is a half measure at best.

"Well there is a program announced last week that would allow a person to stay as a refuge for 3 years and not have to apply for PR or citizenship.  

I think the best course of action is to
1) identify if there is a willingness to host
2) fundraise to make sure the refuges have the resources to live for a few months or longer until they can find jobs
2a) identify individuals that would be willing to come

It will take a community effort to bring a family here and make sure they feel welcome and comfortable, and  also people to go through red tape of setting up a new life.

"So we had workplace order issues when Dylan’s first opened (plus when they first opened they had this weird rice thing instead of regular fries and people were confused by the lack of fries). I personally wouldn’t care if my burger wasn’t exactly the way I wanted it as long as it wasn’t burnt but many work people complained about the sides and the unsolicited medium rare burgers so we didn’t order from them after the first two failures. 

At a new job now and we tried Dylan’s once and same issue with the medium rare. I mean they need to check the temperature and cook of their food. People who want a well done burger will simply never eat a medium rare burger.

"TL;DR: As an American I know there are 'rules' in regards to the flying and conduct of the US flag- but none of these patriot zealots in the US give two shits about it until it suits them. 

Hello Gentleperson (yes I'm one of those 'hippies' lol). American here who has moved to Canada. To the best of my knowledge as I've been told America has a code of conduct regarding the flag! It states that by right you are to fly the flag of the US above any other flag as long as you are on US soil, \*however\* the code also says some other interesting things.

It's not to be printed on anything disposable, it is to be not to be printed on or used as clothing, it is not to be left in the rain, nor is it allowed to become tattered or discolors. Should it touch the ground it is to be respectfully burnt. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/8#:\~:text=The%20flag%20should%20never%20be%20carried%20flat%20or%20horizontally%2C%20but,always%20allowed%20to%20fall%20free.

I bring this all up because a lot of this sort of stuff are done by people who are those I refer to as 'hyper patriots', whom- as someone else suggested, are suffering from some related mental illness. Possibly, and normally, delusion and/or paranoia brought on by some traumatic event in their life. Often times it's the first and it's been indoctrinated into them since birth and as such see themselves and their actions as perfectly rational. However those of us who are open and aware of other going-on's in the world know that it is far from what they think it is.

Right now the US has people \*praising\* Putin and Russian and says the US should be more like Russia (that's a discussion for another day and when I've had more coffee, maybe some vodka) are the same people that tell those like me who want to see genuine change for their home country (and even here where I'm just a PR) for the betterment of the average person to move to Canada, Norway, where ever, there if we 'don't like it here' (one of many inconsistencies and glaring cognitive dissidents with them).",t2_b45t5,Werepup,0,1647694242.0,0,t1_i19wqls,i19wqls,False,Upper-Anxiety-4274,t3_th76ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/th76ht/does_this_make_anyone_else_extremely_frustrated/,Does this make anyone else extremely frustrated?

"Ah ok, I apologize for wording that wrong. But let's not downplay the effect this has on people. We're not talking about having to give up a vacation to Mexico. My husband works at a company that requires proof of vaccination. They haven't dropped the requirement now that the government is relaxing the rules. Workers rights are legally protected as they relate to things like gender, nationality etc. But now employers are allowed to require employees to disclose personal health information. And I can understand if it's truly necessary for the job (ex: healthcare worker) but this is just a food processing plant. 

Don't get me wrong; we happily got the jab as we felt it was the best choice. But looking for a new job would have been rough, financially. For us, it wasn't really a choice, even though it wasn't legally required. 

I think people are worried about their rights not being protected. If employers can choose to hire/fire based on vaccine status, how about another medical condition?

"I’m recovering from disordered eating patterns from middle/high school, compounded by 60lbs of weight gain in 6 months from medication. After my gain, the docs adjusted my meds and my weight was constant for a few months, I tried the FBBC 6-week challenge.
I really liked the 25 minute workouts and coach accountability. I liked that the workouts had a recorded option so I could do them on my own time.

What I didn’t like was the fatphobic, diet culture that I felt they adhered to. Tracking food was mandatory, which can cause obsession in people with previous disorder eating patterns. Can force restriction, which often causes binges. Additionally, at the end of the program, I talked about my long term weight goals, and they told me that my fat percent goal should actually be almost 5% lower than I wanted and would not compromise on what they considered the “ideal fat amount” for MY body.

I did lose weight on their program, but I gained it all back and more after because my body was so messed up from the restriction they pretend is nutrition. Based on the recent scientific research, no restriction diets can offer sustainable wellness results for both physical and mental well-being, so current best recommendations are to increase physical activity and to make small, sustainable diet changes over time (adding more veggies, drinking more water, swapping whole wheat/grain for white/bleached wheat, lower sugar options, leaner meats, etc.).

Ultimately, I cannot recommend a gym that refuses to work with a clients goals and imposes their own goals instead, especially when they require all clients, regardless of goals or past history with disorder eating, to adhere to a strict calorie-based regime. Some people want to pursue health in a way that doesn’t fuel into diet-culture and disordered eating, and if you’re one of these people who want healthy relationships with food and nutrition, then this gym is not likely to be a good fit for you.",t2_4q0dpfbh,sammark99,0,1647666332.0,0,t1_i18y5hj,i18y5hj,True,[deleted],t3_tf7850,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tf7850/fit_body_boot_camp/,Fit Body Boot Camp,/r/Lethbridge/comments/tf7850/fit_body_boot_camp/i18y5hj/,2,r/Lethbridge,0,2

"I think it’s worth clarifying that people can be privileged in one or many areas, which impacts their opportunities and treatment by society.

A poor white male could still get hired at many places that would reject a poor black female with equal credentials and abilities.
Privilege in one area just means they aren’t discriminated against in the *one* way, but can face struggles in others.

"As far as the big banks go, they are almost all the same so if you find a branch that has friendly service, go there. 

I banked with RBC for almost a decade, and I moved out here in September and had horrible in-branch experiences so I moved my accounts to BMO. 

If you ask 20 different people which bank is the best and worst, you’ll have horror stories from each of the main banks and praise for each of them as well. I chose BMO because I like the way the accounts are set up (and they have specialized indigenous banking offers). 

I’d recommend a credit union if you plan on living in Alberta for a long time. The only reason I didn’t move to a credit union was because I move quite often so I like to be with a bank that I know will be in every city I go to. Just check out which credit unions have the best offerings (Servus is probably the one that is most similar to a bigger bank).",t2_4t5xiokb,bellowingburrito,0,1647660177.0,0,t1_i18no66,i18no66,True,blueblink77,t3_thkplu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/thkplu/recommendations_on_credit_unions_or_banks/,Recommendations on credit unions or banks,/r/Lethbridge/comments/thkplu/recommendations_on_credit_unions_or_banks/i18no66/,6,r/Lethbridge,0,6

"Wine and beyond my friend.

They have a very large selection of whiskeys, great staff who are actually knowledgeable and enjoy it. Usually i tell them a tasting note or experience im looking for and they can nail it down for me but i have been there several times so the one staff member who is a bit of a younger guy but super knowledgeable knows what im looking for. 

Last time i was there, it was still under construction but they have an isle or area of an isle dedicated to bourbon(and white whiskey), scotch (by region), japanese, canadian and irish. 

Wine cavern is nice but they have a small selection of nothing special, Andrew Hilton is even smaller and pricier and with prices as they are, best place i find is still Wine and Beyond.

"I've greatly appreciated my relationship with 1st Choice Savings and Credit Union. They really provide personal service. If you need cheques printed it's done immediately on site. Exchanging for foreign currency is easy. 

I've left the province and still bank there. When issues arise I'm able to email the banker I set my account up with and get them resolved (needing a direct deposit form, locking myself out of the app, etc). 

The app was recently revamped. It's functional, allows for biometric sign in, and I've had no issues with it. There's a secondary app that has discounts and what not at businesses for members. 

When we opened an account for the kid she took a lot of time to discuss banking, savings, etc with him. I appreciated that. 

The fees are a little higher because credit union but it's worth it for the relationship and personal service.

Trudeau has won 3 out of 3 consecutive elections. Canada chose him, and not just once as a fluke. And they hate that. 

Being compassionate and prioritizing the well-being of their community over their own convenience feels like a very Canadian thing to me. And they hate that too. 

So why are they using this flag to represent their cause when it more literally represents a country that is in direct conflict with their self-centred and deliberately ignorant worldview? 

Also, a lot of the people on FB that I saw making Pro-Convoy posts are the same people Ive seen expressing support for separating from Canada. So... they hate this country so much they want to leave it and take the whole province with them...but they still want to wave around our flag?

"This is just it.

Plus, many people have courses that are only offered in the Spring semester. So imagine not being able to graduate on time, and start a potential job that is lined up, through no fault of your own. THEN, waiting an entire \*year\* to finish where you left off?

They're really digging themselves a hole. I'm frankly shocked that a resolution hasn't been reached yet. I estimated that if it wasn't resolved last week - they'd be better off offering crucial courses (needed to graduate, start practicum like yourself) in the summer - and just give everyone credit or refund for this semester. The reason is, there's no way to pack in the relevant coursework on time now. You're going to be losing some of the value of the course you paid full price for - and have a hellish April. That's the best case scenario, and that seems really inadequate to me.

I say call the semester, arrange for the crucial classes to be completed in the summer, resolve this strike issue, and call it a day. The delivery of some courses over the summer may fuck with some people, and I do understand that. People have summer worked lined up, they have leases running out in May. But at least it offers the fairest solution, IMO.

Cramming courses past April \*really\* fucks with people because then it is messing with leases, summer job line ups for the entire student body, and it will make everyone miserable.

"I typed it all out and then had to delete it! That's OK though, it's good for civility.

I was going to say that people are abstract creatures. We place a lot of value on forms of expression. So I understand that. But to take the interpretation of a symbol to the point of being offended by it, or worse yet - wanting it banned in some cases - that's delving in to the realm of zealous actions based on perceived moral purity.

For example - most people object the Nazi flag. For very understandable reasons. But the author of Bill C-313 thinks it is \*literally\* threatening. To me, that is no different than zealous religious leaders during the crusades banning heathen religious symbols out of a view that they are literally offending God.

At the end of the day, these are just scribbles. They're literally nothing - they're pieces of cloth with stuff imprinted on them. That's it. Every other aspect about them is subjective. Since every person may interpret something differently - what is the point of being offended over it? If we simply yield to the offense that overly sensitive people put on displays of things, what does that make us? Where exactly do we draw that line?

Anyways - I know you're not advocating for an upside down Canadian flag to be banned or anything. I think sometimes pointing out the extreme examples helps reflect on the more benign.

"So, usual caveat that I'm not a lawyer or a bylaw expert or whatever, but I'm 90% sure that isn't true. Bikes are treated as vehicles in some ways, but in the case of Mayor Magrath bikes are explicitly forbidden from using the road, because Mayor Magrath doesn't have a sidewalk, it has a parallel ""multi-use pathway"". So we aren't allowed to act as vehicles.

I think the confusion comes from bikes not being allowed on normal sidewalks (that's the law in Calgary and Edmonton, and I think Lethbridge as well, although I'm not 100% sure), so generally a bike shouldn't use a crosswalk because they shouldn't have been on the sidewalk in the first place.

More theft from cars and even from within the pool (i.e. kids coming into the pool just to go around and steal wallets and cell phones from people's bags).,t2_ft23g,peternorthstar,0,1647531967.0,0,t1_i114nq3,i114nq3,True,Tuezdaze,t3_tgbql9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tgbql9/psa_slp_skatepark_is_already_ramping_up_to/,"PSA) SLP skatepark is already ramping up to sketchy levels.

"We don’t have a location in mind yet. We’ve thrown around a few ideas, but so far only have some broad criteria for what would be needed (mainly, accessible location and affordable for a community project)

Other tool libraries have often started in community centres or other similar spaces, so if anyone has a suggestion/lead on that we’re all ears.

We should note, we’re tentatively hoping for a launch in the early half of next year so anything would need to be able to wait that long for move in.",t2_ks16yuds,LethToolLibrary,0,1647530654.0,0,t1_i111bh9,i111bh9,False,LethToolLibrary,t3_tgb5zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tgb5zd/lethbridge_tool_library_becoming_a_thing/,Lethbridge Tool Library - Becoming a thing,/r/Lethbridge/comments/tgb5zd/lethbridge_tool_library_becoming_a_thing/i111bh9/,1,r/Lethbridge,0,1
"Pun definitely intended. Haha. I have to make light of the situation to try to make myself stop thinking of all the bad shit that we just witnessed.

"SLP is the skatepark by Spitz Stadium/Henderson. Yes, 9-11 was called as we all scrambled into our vehicle after seeing the guns. As we were going to leave the parking lot is when we saw the boy get hit. Thankfully, he got right back up off the ground because my Mama Bear senses were going to have me flying over there if he didn’t get up… when he was part of the group with the guns. When he got back up, all the kids just flew into vehicles and everybody started taking off like wildfire.",t2_1ssk78yr,Tuezdaze,0,1647530440.0,0,t1_i110rxw,i110rxw,False,Tuezdaze,t3_tgbql9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tgbql9/psa_slp_skatepark_is_already_ramping_up_to/,"PSA) SLP skatepark is already ramping up to sketchy levels.
