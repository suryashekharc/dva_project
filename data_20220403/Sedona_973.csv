"Actually the way I understand it (could be wrong), the laws are written such that you can stay on Forest Service land doing ‘dispersed camping’ for two weeks but then cannot do it again within one year. If they cite you, there’s some sort of fine.

The Forest Service is cracking down on this stuff around Sedona by doing more patrols, using computerized car license plate tracking and consolidating dispersed camping into areas. They’re mostly worrying about forest and eco/resource degradation, sanitation and health issues and fire danger especially as we head into Summer.

"One thing if you're 100% east coast and not accustomed to high desert to keep in mind is the altitude. Just the drive from Phoenix to Sedona takes you about \~3,200 feet vertically, which to me isn't much but I've known people who felt that change. The Grand Canyon is another 3,000 feet up or so. 

When we first moved to the area from coastal California my husband was very mildly altitude sick. People sensitive to altitude shifts often feel nauseous or get a headache, so be prepared in case anyone feels that. I suggest bottles of water with electrolyte packets shaken into them (there are a bunch of brands you can buy lots of places). it's not dangerous at these lower elevations—my understanding is you don't have to worry below 8,000 feet—but if anyone starts to feel a little dizzy it's helpful to know why.",t2_101s3g,JonBenet_Palm,0,1647720186.0,0,t1_i1biqw5,i1biqw5,True,kaairo,t3_thbszu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sedona/comments/thbszu/visiting_sedona_in_june/,Visiting Sedona in June,/r/Sedona/comments/thbszu/visiting_sedona_in_june/i1biqw5/,1,r/Sedona,0,1
"Depends on what you’re doing and your strategy. I went hiking in Grand Canyon, Arizona, Utah, etc. in July…and I preferred long pants and shirts, but lightweight. And a big sun hat. That type of clothing is good for sun protection- and we ended up sweating off our sunscreen pretty fast anyway. One item I totally recommend- a cool towel. It’s one of those scarf looking things that you get wet and put around your neck, etc. This saved my whole family! Game changer. In the evening, I wore sun dresses and that felt really nice and comfortable. We also kept a cooler in our trunk at all times with iced down drinks. We’d just refill it at the hotels as we traveled. That helped with morale. :) And maybe advise your parents not to walk down into Grand Canyon…I saw tons of older, unprepared folks trying to do that. You’re going to have a great time, even in June! Seems like you’ll be well prepared.

Edit- there are plenty of absolutely gorgeous and very easy hikes and view points all around Sedona, and they’ll likely enjoy just walking the rim at Grand Canyon. In my experience it was breath taking and paved and flat- great combo. :) You can check out AllTrails for some examples of easy Sedona hikes.

Just did this last month! We left Sedona around 5:30am and got to the south entrance at 7:45am. No traffic or waiting at the entrance. We did a hike down Kaibab trail and had the place to ourselves. Then went to the visitor center for overlooks and lunch at the lodge. On the way back we went east along the rim and stopped at most of the lookouts. We also stopped at Wupatki National Monument and it was very much worth the drive.

"I was just there two weeks ago and here’s what we did. We stayed in Sedona three nights then stayed in Flagstaff a night to get us a little closer to the canyon.

This route was recommended to us by a local and it worked perfectly. Drive north on 89 toward Cameron then go west toward the visitors center. Stop at all five or six overlooks along the way. Way less crowded than at visitors center. 

We got ice cream and souvenirs at the overlook with the cool historic tower. We actually didn’t even go to the visitor center because we had already seen so many views before it

As someone else suggested, you're better off staying overnight if you can.

"You don’t need a hotel to access “all the fun things to do” - believe me. Call Pink Jeep to arrange a Jeep tour ~3 hours, $125/person or so. The rest you can/will want to do on your own.

1. Hiking - my personal favs are along SR179 - Bell Rock, CathedralRock, Yavapai Vista, Little Horsehead Trail, but along 89A you can access Devil’s Bridge, Doe Mountain, Boynton Canyon, and Soldier Pass. 
2. Drive through Oak Creek Canyon. The colors are gorgeous in the fall on this north end of 89A, and you can stop along the way at a number of picnic and hiking areas (including the famed West Fork).
3. Visit the Native American sites - Palatki (need to make reservations ahead of time) or VBarV (open weekends only) for ruins and petroglyphs.
4. State Parks: Red Rock State Park for hiking, birds/wildlife and education, great for families, Slide Rock in Oak Creek Canyon, West Fork and Crescent Moon Ranch Park.
5. Jerome. Day trip for walking and ghost town experience - can be combined with Old Town Cottonwood for great food and wine.
6. Wine - we have a newly-minted AVA in the Verde Valley, including Page Springs and Cottonwood. Book yourself a tour or drive (and drink) responsibly. If you go to Page Springs, make reservations for dinner at Up the Creek for great food and birds!
7. Shopping. Sedona is broken into three areas - West Sedona, along 89A, which has restaurants and lodging, movie theaters, grocery and RX stores, ends at the double roundabouts. Beyond the roundabouts on 89A is Uptown - here you can park and walk and shop to your heart’s content while taking in the views of Oak Creek Canyon. It’s pretty touristy. To the east of the roundabouts, you turn onto SR179, which takes you to the Village of Oak Creek (VOC), but before you get there is the famed tlaquepaque shopping center - upscale arts and crafts and nice restaurants. Beyond that is the Hillside shopping center with more restaurants and galleries. Beyond that is the gorgeous drive through the red rocks and the VOC.
8. Food is pretty personal, but we have everything from pretty decent sushi (Hiro’s) to Lisa Dahl’s Mariposa, a not-to-be-missed view overlooking north Sedona and pricey grilled meat and fancy cocktails. Some places require reservations (like Mariposa), but you can just walk into Javalina Cantina for margaritas and good Mexican food. I also recommend Creekside near Tlaquepaque for brunch and views.

That is generally enough to burn through several days of time in our beautiful area, but if you still need more ideas, I’m sure a host or concierge or one of the many tourist information booths will be happy to help you. Keep in mind it’s at 4k+ elevation, so it can be blazing hot during the day yet quite cool in the evening.

"Yep it is dry as a damn bone right now.  

Water does not last long.

The ecosystem here not the same as, say, the Midwest or the Sierra or the Rockies. Our soil is quite porous… lotsa sand and rock. The water just runs and evaporates… creeks are all extremely seasonal and by that I mean, they hold water for a few days (not weeks) during the monsoons in mid summer and then beyond that on rare occasions hold water immediately after a storm. And there again only for a few days. There are a few rare exceptions to this: creeks that either have really long courses and or have springs at the headwaters, but here in AZ a creek or river that actually has water in it is cause for conversation… the rare exception rather than the rule. 
 
Canyon temps on sunny warm days (like the next week or so get hot since the rocks magnify the temp.

“Preventative Search and Rescue” is a real thing currently, a key area of focus among those who work with the Forest Service, and the task is to remind visitors that this is a dry and unforgiving desert environment. And advise people to prep appropriately for their own rescue and to stay out of harms way. We get VERY busy between now and July with this subject.

"It's expensive. 

It's crowded. 

There is a lot of traffic (if your in a car.) 

If you want to stay in town, it may be worthwhile to use Sedona Hot Rides (Teslas!) to go from Sky Harbor to Sedona. Then in Sedona, rent an ebike for a week. 

It's getting to the point that it can be difficult to find parking at many popular trailheads, and especially on the weekends, the roundabouts are almost always gridlocked. 

Can you do Sedona without a car? Sure can. You'll need a shuttle to get up to West Fork of Oak Creek Canyon. You might also need a lift if you want to go out to far west Sedona.

I’ve never had a picture like this on an iPhone. The rest of the pics are totally normal. It’s pretty obvious it’s a shadow of me holding up a phone. I don’t know who the other shadow is. The shoes are my husbands feet. There were two other people around but I didn’t even realize I took a picture of our shadows at all. And why is it pixelated at the top?

The population of Sedona increases on avg 500%-1000% depending on the day per day in busy season.

"I totally appreciate the concern. It’s been a new experience trying to trip plan with such scarce water. If y’all are still in drought by the time we start our trip (mid March) I think we will just do a series of single night trips up to the rim on either side of oak creek, probably with a night up the west fork, and hitch/road walk down 89-A a bit each day until we get to sterling pass and head into Sedona. Would absolutely love to be able to do a long trip on the rim, down loy canyon, and then back east to Sedona but it seems like water may be too unreliable to do something like that next month.

"This is pretty unforgiving country. Bushwhacking here is full of cat claw bushes and all other manner of thorny stuff.  That with your downhill vertical, coupled with the lack of water (we are in a severe drought), and it does not look very favorable or at all fun.

"Frank Lloyd Wright would never have built a house like that. His entire genre and philosophy was to build homes that blend into and incorporate nature, not something like this. I lived in a home he designed in Colorado Springs for a time - think river rock and stream flowing thru the house, windows that vent to allow natural cooling and heating, dual-purpose furnishing and storage. He would be more inclined to build a home out of red rock than build one that abuses it. 

I have to believe the city and county are looking for ways to prevent this from happening again, but given this is the county that gave us Paul Gosar I guess I may be a tad cynical.

"Kiddos like Bell Rock for hiking (level-ish path, can climb on the rock) and Templeton Trail (in Village of Oak Creek - take State Route 179 to Verde Valley School Road all the way to the end parking lot - trail takes you along Oak Creek (place to stop and play in the water if you want) and can go over to Cathedral Rock if you want. You can access Cathedral Rock from Back O’ Beyond, but it’s a small parking lot that fills up early and then the road is closed off. Oak Creek Canyon (89a) is a nice drive with several parks to stop at along the way. All (well, most) parking lots have a fee - you can buy a Red Rock pass for a day or two if you’re planning to go to several places.

Red Rock State Park is great for kids and adults - $7 for adults,$4 for kiddos. Hiking, no wading or creek access (although go over the creek via Kingfisher bridge).

Jerome is an old mining/ghost town - park and walk around the hilly town, have lunch at The Haunted Hamburger.

Pricier options - take a jeep tour - $125/person or so, but so fun and worth it. Kids will love it. Can rent those quad things to drive around some of the wilderness. Edit - be sure to make reservations as these fill up.

Tourist shopping at uptown - on 89a, before heading up Oak Creek Canyon - lots of restaurants and shops, views.

That should kill a couple of days pretty well. Keep in mind most parks are state or local, so there’s generally a fee. Also, I think the Sedona Film Festival starts next week as well as the holiday weekend, so town will be crowded.",t2_cxjsw02m,michelleinAZ,0,1644745380.0,0,t1_hwre272,hwre272,True,Willbeprayingforyou,t3_srade5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sedona/comments/srade5/jerome_to_sedona/,Jerome to Sedona,/r/Sedona/comments/srade5/jerome_to_sedona/hwre272/,4,r/Sedona,1,4

"You have a pretty good likelihood of starting in snow (or not: it's been an insanely dry la niña). That means that as you go lower, there will be some combo of running water and filterable pockets of standing water in most canyons. OR you could be dealing with rivulets and fast, cold streams in full flow, with a danger of flash floods if it rains (climate change has turned a good chunk of spring snow to rain, but there's a lot of yearly variability). It's just really hard to predict.

Unless we have absolutely catastrophic drought (which is certainly possible, but you'll know it in advance of course), most but not all tanks should have sufficient water in March.

If necessary, you can also always cut down to the West Fork Trail and Oak Creek Canyon from the rim instead, and pop back out over A.B. Young Trail and down into Sedona that way.

There's no single established route that way, but there are many great segments you can piece together. A lot of it will be remote, a portion of it will be without cell service, and you should be prepared to self-rescue if necessary.

Alternately, you could head out 180 north from Flag, take forest service roads over to Williams, and 73 down the rim (some paved, a lot of gravel), coming back in to Sedona from the west.

"Sedona is truly a housing nightmare, and it's only going to get worse. If you're really interested in getting to the area, I'd recommend looking at living in Cottonwood - it's gotten worse lately but it's not nearly as bad as Sedona. The healthcare in the region is centered there, so it would be the spot to find employment options (or more cheaply bring out your own practice).  If you wanted to work in Sedona, it's a short and ridiculously beautiful commute.

"If you are looking to camp at an unofficial spot, I had good luck on schnebly hill road. It *is* a rougherish road but it is totally doable in a sedan if you are a competent offroad driver. And you only need to go a mile or two up the road. It gets worse as you go farther. Then there are many little side pulloffs with enough space for a vehicle or two to park, and terrain appropriate for camping right next to a cute little creek. I car camped there for several days a couple years ago and was not bothered; I saw others doing the same. Dunno if this is still a good option, or if I was just lucky I didn't get harassed by a park ranger, but thought I'd give it a mention.

"Oh, you're going to have so much fun! Devil's Bridge is one of my favorite places in the world, so I'd definitely say this one is my favorite.

The last time I did it was 2017 and I've read a few things about it being a lot more popular now, so I'd look into the parking situations. Also, this sounds a little obvious but it's worth remembering that there are several paths to actually get to the bridge that vary in length, so just double check you're on the one you want to be on.

Cathedral Rock is amazing. I was there just this last Wednesday actually. This one is nice because it's not crazy-long, but there is definitely some scrambling towards the top.

"Hi there, I just visited all the vortexes last week! So happy you're going to stop there too. Since you only have about 90 minutes to spare, you might not be able to complete the longer trails since you're in a time constraint.

I think the easiest for you to complete might be *Airport Scenic Lookout*. There are a handful of parking spots at the base, and a larger parking up the road aways where you can hike back down (less than a mile, easy trails). The view of Sedona from here is stunning. I always recommend hiking shoes, but this is one that I see a lot of people doing in just tennis shoes. Its an easier hike.

You might also be able to get a little bit of *Cathedral Rock* in, but the parking is hit or miss and most people seem to get there early in the morning (think sunrise). You don't have to hike to the top to get an amazing view, but there is definitely some scrambling.

If you do *Bell Rock*, you can hike 5 feet or 5 miles and everything will look incredible. You can complete just a fraction of this trail and it will be beautiful. If recommend the larger parking lot (there are two lots here) as I've always had much better luck finding a spot that way. 

*Boynton Canyon* is painfully beautiful. Since you only have 90 minutes, you may not have enough time to really get to experience it here, but if recommended researching it a little more to see if you can squeeze it in. Its worth coming back to visit when you have the time to experience it. Parking is also a hellscape (I went earlier on a Wednesday morning and we got the last space. People were driving in circles for an hour waiting for someone to leave).

I hope this helps! I've hiked Sedona many times, just make sure you stay hydrated :)",t2_13ve1k,cosmiceggroll,0,1637593746.0,0,t1_hln8t40,hln8t40,True,hasek3139,t3_qze0gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sedona/comments/qze0gh/easy_vortex_to_see_for_1_hour/,Easy vortex to see for 1 hour?,/r/Sedona/comments/qze0gh/easy_vortex_to_see_for_1_hour/hln8t40/,6,r/Sedona,0,6

"I think the big story in Sedona at this moment in time is OVERTOURISM and how the small time city government is not managing it.  We have about 16k residents and get about 3,000,000 visitors per year… about the same ratio as VENICE.  

But in spite of this, there are no proactive programs to manage the tourist crowds or air bnb neighborhoods thst are endangering our sense of community and culture.  Why? Perhaps because many of our local officials and politicians are, like so many smaller tourist oriented communities, simlply too close exonomically or even vocationally to tourism… so many seem to feel that managing tourism is somehow anti-tourism.    I would point you to talking with Christopher Fox Graham with our local paper Red Rock News. He sees things for what they are IMHO, and may be better able to help you find a story with traction, heroes and villans… and many who are caught in the middle of this war… the citizens and workers brcome the collateral damage here.

"The thing I like about Sedona is that it's not a one dimensional resort town. It's got many different groups living on top of one another. A few that come to mind: 

* Outdoor thrillseekers (climbers, off-roaders, etc.)
* Spa people (remember that illegal sweat lodge disaster?)
* Rich resort people
* Woo-woo wellness people (they were in to crystals WAY before Gwyneth Paltrow made them popular)
* Native Americans
* Locals working service jobs
* Artists
* Retirees (mostly from Phoenix)
* UFO enthusiasts

These are very different groups and they often are at odds. Also worth mentioning is the significant number of people who flat out refuse to visit Sedona because of the woo-woo wellness people. This cohort tends to stay in Prescott instead.  

Anyways, you don't usually see this kind of diversity in destinations like this.

"While sunflowers are thought to have originated in Mexico and Peru, they are one of the first plants to ever be cultivated in the United States. They have been used for more than 5,000 years by the Native Americans, who not only used the seeds as a food and an oil source, but also used the flowers, roots and stems for varied purposes including as a dye pigment. The Spanish explorers brought sunflowers back to Europe, and after being first grown in Spain, they were subsequently introduced to other neighboring countries. Currently, sunflower oil is one of the most popular oils in the world.

"Can your wife (and you, for that matter) hike? If you can, for sunrise (or sunset) I recommend the top of Sugarloaf. It's about a half-hour hike, and the last part of it to the summit is up a steepish trail. (It's not really that steep, but if you're out of shape, you'll probably want to stop once or twice to catch your breath. I've seen little kids do it, though; and I'm old and do it regularly.)

The top of Sugarloaf has a magnificent 360° view, but few people seem to know about it. That may be because the trailhead is located in a residential area of town, pretty far off the beaten touristy tracks.

Note: Sugarloaf is different from Little Sugarloaf, which is much steeper and not recommended for those with bad knees. As you might guess, I speak from experience.

"Here's one for you- do the Fay's Canyon hike. It's about a mile back on a flat creek. At the end, go past the ""end of maintained trail"" sign and up to the left of the rock butte. There are some flat areas and amazing views back the canyon and out to Cathedral Rock and Bell Rock. Also, a massive concave area in the cliff face. It's going to be much more private than a lot of other areas. Here's an album of some photos if that helps.

"You're getting some fantastic suggestions here, would like to throw out another. With pretty much every area of Sedona being overrun by tourists, if you're looking for something a little more private, check out the Secret Slickrock trail.
