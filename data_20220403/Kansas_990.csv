">Murder is murder, even if performed by the state.

This is certainly not true.  It is not possible for the state to commit murder.   To suggest that means you do not now the definition of murder which is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought.   

Also, note that in Hebrew the word for murder was translated to killing because of the limitation of language at the time.   The true translation of the 5th commandment is ""You shalt not murder"".

"Those are absolutely *not* the institutions I’m talking about. Those are primarily policies. Policies come and go. I’m talking about institutions, *structures*. Congress and its norms, the electoral college, the State Department, the intelligence apparatus, the judicial system, etc. Things that Republicans continuously weaponize against the most vulnerable, both at home and abroad, and that the Democrats/liberals are beholden to as some sort of intrinsic “good” or necessity.

They aren’t *supposed* to be responsive to public will, they’re very much intended to thwart it at every opportunity.

"> Because Dems believe the institutions themselves are sacred rather than the people they represent, they have no counter-punch to throw.

I'd tend to disagree here. The institutions we're talking about like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the ACA, the post office, policies like minimum wage, federal LGBT rights, etc - are critical to supporting *the people* that Democrats represent. And while the GOP hasn't been able to fully tear down most of these because they continue to be popular among even many Republicans, less popular regulatory and culture war policies (eg: abortion laws, teaching about racism, LGBT rights, etc) are definitely being eaten away at around the edges.

To your point, the fight has now turned to whether you are even *for government* or *against government*. Trump weakened the very idea that government serves the people, or that politicians and a party are even devoted to service rather than grifting.  

The reason Democrats cannot give up on defending institutions is that the institutions of government are an equalizing factor in civil society - providing equity where non exists to primarily low-income, minorities, and out-groups that need support; plus basic services that all Americans enjoy. The GOP represents primarily white med-high income households that don't rely as much on equalizing benefits, so they're always in a position to call these benefits wasteful and attempt to de-fund or eliminate the institutions providing them.

The ways in which the GOP's approach can fail here are when (1) enough people get upset about a favored benefit/institution going away (eg: GW Bush tries to eliminate Social Security or privatize the post office), (2) enough people view eliminating institutions itself as in some way unfair (eg: people will eventually get upset the white nationalist GOP is no longer teaching black history, or trying to repeal gay marriage, etc) or (3) if the GOP enacts an alternate institution that people find worse (eg: replacing abortion with the Texas $10K anti-abortion lawsuit approach that's screwing over Texas women).

The GOP is pretty consistently 'the party of no' - that is no new policies, just tearing down old policies. At *some* point, you reach a place where enough people are pissed *enough* about taking away things they like, or pissed about whatever is replacing it, that they get off their asses and do something. We just haven't reached that place yet, but we're headed there. And until that happens, Democrats *cannot* just abandon existing institutions and somehow call that a win.",t2_5otyw,cyberphlash,0,1648842470.0,0,t1_i30vihp,i30vihp,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_ttcwyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/ttcwyk/sharice_davids_gops_gerrymander_of_3rd_district/,Sharice Davids: GOP's gerrymander of 3rd District map a gambit to thwart will of voters,/r/kansas/comments/ttcwyk/sharice_davids_gops_gerrymander_of_3rd_district/i30vihp/,3,r/kansas,0,3

The reign of their political ideology, the de facto ideology of the country’s leaders since at least the 80’s (if not the whole post-WWII era), is coming to a close. Voters are becoming younger and more diverse, with radically different world views than the fossils currently in charge.

So they gerrymander. They refuse to accept Democrat judicial nominees in order to stuff the courts with their own ideological extremists. They pass laws that make what was once de facto discrimination against LGBTQ people and people of color enshrined into law as de jure discrimination, and their newly packed courts will refuse to move against it.

Meanwhile the Democrats refusal to acknowledge Republicans as opposition, rather than partners in governance (a categorization Republicans have no difficulty slotting Dems into), ensures that Republican manipulation of structures and institutions goes unpunished. Because Dems believe the institutions themselves are sacred rather than the people they represent, they have no counter-punch to throw. Say what you will about the Republicans- at least they have a political project, as disgusting as it may be. The Democrats have nothing.

I sympathize with Rep. Davids. She seems like a good one. But until her party wakes up to the danger we’re in, she’ll be just another casualty of the Republican last grasp for power.",t2_jxi4v,SKyJ007,0,1648819728.0,0,t1_i2zbleo,i2zbleo,True,Geek-Haven888,t3_ttcwyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/ttcwyk/sharice_davids_gops_gerrymander_of_3rd_district/,Sharice Davids: GOP's gerrymander of 3rd District map a gambit to thwart will of voters,/r/kansas/comments/ttcwyk/sharice_davids_gops_gerrymander_of_3rd_district/i2zbleo/,18,r/kansas,0,18

"Thanks so much for your comment! That said, the problem with cloth or reusable diapers for parents dealing with extremely impoverished living conditions today is that daycare centers are almost entirely required for both parents to work to make a living for the household. Built in daycare isn't as common today with older children as it was, for example back when I was younger. Daycare centers today don't accept taking care of any child unless the parents can support a full weeks worth of disposable diapers, one full week per child, and that's something that many parents in poverty simply can't afford in advance.

I've learned in my social class studies that those within working class find it hard to plan more than a per day basis. It is just overall difficult for anyone, and the vicious cycle that keeps parents at home taking care of their kids instead of working a job (to help take themselves and their families out of extreme poverty) is impacted by the fact that they can't pay for the diapers to help place their kids in daycare.",t2_annhsv2s,WashburnAmbassador,0,1648693030.0,0,t1_i2spzen,i2spzen,False,WashburnAmbassador,t3_tr6un9,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/tr6un9/washburn_universitys_diaper_drive/,Washburn University's Diaper Drive,/r/kansas/comments/tr6un9/washburn_universitys_diaper_drive/i2spzen/,3,r/kansas,0,3

"Everybody calm down. 

For people wondering, here is what will happen as it always does in these pissing contests with the federal government/Medicare 

Medicare will mandate it.  How?   Medicare will stop payments to any facility that is not in compliance with their policy that everybody working in nursing homes must be vaccinated.  This is a death sentence for facilities.  

https://khn.org/news/article/with-a-vaccine-mandate-looming-nursing-homes-face-more-staffing-problems/amp/

“The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 13 upheld a federal mandate requiring health care workers at facilities that receive Medicaid or Medicare funding to be fully vaccinated. If all staffers — excluding those with approved religious or medical exemptions — aren’t fully vaccinated, the facility will lose that money.”


Kansas cannot enforce it all they want.  When Medicare shuts down the gravy train, everybody will fall in line

This is how Medicare makes all sorts of stuff happen, it is standard operating procedure for them

Hmmm, also there is sunflower seed candy, something like brittle, which I'd guess can be popular in Asian countries. Sunflower seed Halva is also very popular in a post-soviet block, so perhaps there is a market for that in India too?

"What...what preys on sunflowers? Insects? Deer? A fungus?

I'm sure it is mundane, but there's just something about a goofy looking top-heavy flower having a ""natural predator"" that tickles my imagination. 

Cue David Attenborough voice: ""The rare, Midwestern Floribunda Cat stalks it's favourite prey: the sunflower. Once the heads are ripe and full of protein providing seeds, the cat will leap up and seize the flower, rending and tearing the delicious prize. This may seem savage from the plant's perspective, but the cat doesn't finish every single seed, and it very efficient at spreading seeds for the native sunflower to spread and return the next year. Sunflower farmers, however, see the cat not as a part of nature but as a threat. A single Midwestern Floribunda Cat has been known to destroy half an acre of cultivated sunflowers in one night. Farmers and naturalists are locked in a heated battle over Midwestern Floribunda Cat population control.""",t2_x9z6k,_Franz_Kafka_,1,1648570684.0,0,t1_i2kxai4,i2kxai4,False,cluck2010,t3_tqyxjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/tqyxjo/our_time_to_shine/,Our time to shine!,/r/kansas/comments/tqyxjo/our_time_to_shine/i2kxai4/,2,r/kansas,0,2

"The alternatives to plastic bags aren’t that great either for the environment, especially when looking at our greatest threat - climate change. 

A single use plastic bag uses a by product of oil and gas production and takes very little energy to produce. By contrast a more durable multi use plastic bag may take hundred if not thousands of times the energy to product. A canvas or cotton bag will take thousands of times the energy to produce and especially if organic - will cause massive water draws in some of the most drought stricken regions of the world. 

Disposable bags will often get a second life as a dog poop bag or lunch sack or other material. 

Some suggestions that could help minimize plastic bags without damaging our environment further: 
-	The city could require that people actually use disposable grocery bags for their trash instead of buying a new hefty bag. 
-	Used grocery bag holders instead of new bags at dog parks
-	Enforcement patrols or anti-littering and dumping laws already on the books

"You can repurpose plastic bags.  It can be argued that plastic has even more secondary uses than paper.  Plastic bags are made from HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) which is perhaps the easiest plastic to recycle.  Seriously, HDPE begins melting at about 250 degrees.  You can melt it down in an old oven and form all kinds of hard plastic things.   Given the price of lumber it's almost golden. 

Take the time to research it and see that the environmental impact between paper and plastic isn’t all that much.  It takes a qualified amount of natural resources and energy either way. 

I’m firmly in the camp that thinks the government should let the consumer and merchant decide. It's called freedom.   Frankly, it’s a sad state of affairs that a law is written that prevents a city or township from banning things that should be a decision of the people.

Our illustrious legislature in its infinite wisdom has passed a bill which declares that local municipalities shouldn't have home rule when it comes to banning or regulating plastic bags and other plastic materials such as plastic straws, cups, bottles, and containers. But of course they believe in states' rights when it comes to federal mandates. The Kansas Chamber of Commerce which is now controlled by Charles Koch was pushing this legislation. Of course, Koch Industries makes most of its money from petroleum and Charles Koch is a libertarian who is against all government regulation. The Lawrence Sustainability Board had been studying whether plastic bags should be banned or taxed. As has been said, there are more plastic bags than tumbleweeds blowing in the wind in Kansas. With the new law this phenomenon is likely to continue.",t2_fwru7e7e,PrairieHiker,0,1648420265.0,0,t1_i2d8rl5,i2d8rl5,True,PrairieHiker,t3_tpux26,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/tpux26/more_plastic_bags_than_tumbleweeds_blowing_in_the/,More Plastic Bags than Tumbleweeds Blowing in the Wind,/r/kansas/comments/tpux26/more_plastic_bags_than_tumbleweeds_blowing_in_the/i2d8rl5/,39,r/kansas,0,39

"I lived in Texas (Fort-worth Dallas area) for a while.   Came back to Kansas City because my house here was owned free and clear.   You don't have to make much money if you live debt free. Still, I'm constantly battling between what I liked best between Kansas City and Dallas.  

For starters, they suck at BBQ.   They think they have good BBQ in Texas.  Nope.  Kansas City is King of BBQ.   We are also better at Mexican restaurants, Tacos and such.  Which is kinda hard to believe considering Texas.  That is until you have lived in both places.    

The things I miss about Texas is no state income taxes.  Before I never gave it much thought but now I'm back in Kansas and I think it is the worse thing about Kansas and the best thing about Texas.   There is a huge economic disparity between the two states and I think it is the directly attributed to tax structure.  I just wish Kansas had the same kinds of economic opportunities as there are in Texas. 

The weather is more to my liking in Texas as well.   It does get hotter but my old body just feels better in the warmer climate.

""Marshall said he was troubled by Jackson’s work on criminal cases during her career as a defense attorney and federal judge. He also asserted in a statement Jackson had a “tendency for legislating from behind the bench and an affinity to growing government.”

Marshall said Jackson lacked “serious experience” needed to serve on the nation’s highest court.

In addition, Marshall said the judge opposed President Donald Trump’s expedited removal of undocumented immigrants and would be a “rubberstamp” for President Joe Biden’s agenda.""

"In the 1800s, the Quakers were strongly abolitionist, often supporting the Underground Railroad.  They already had a presence at the Shawnee Mission, ministering to the Shawnee. When Kansas was opened up for settlement, it quickly became obvious the real intent of the Kansas-Nebraska Act was for pro-slavery groups from Missouri to populate Kansas and bring it in as a slave state.  Abolitionist groups back East set up organizations to bring free state supporters to Kansas (Lawrence, for example, was founded with help from the New England Emigrant Aid Company).  This included many Quakers, who were also attracted to the new lands as well as the cause.

Being pacifists, they largely stayed out of the Bleeding Kansas, except to offer shelter to free staters needing refuge.  Oddly, several Quakers were friends of John Brown, despite the latter's penchant for violence in his cause, and aided Brown in spiriting slaves Brown freed to Canada.",t2_hw45j,RonPossible,0,1648222330.0,0,t1_i22r5fw,i22r5fw,True,Zicona,t3_tnnsfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansas/comments/tnnsfi/why_are_there_so_many_quakers_in_kansas/,Why are there so many quakers in Kansas?,/r/kansas/comments/tnnsfi/why_are_there_so_many_quakers_in_kansas/i22r5fw/,102,r/kansas,1,102

"I'm from northwest of Oskaloosa and my experience is that in all these small towns, there is need for skilled labor.  All these little towns used to have auto repair shops, but since the 80's-90's they mostly closed.  Now, there is a newer generation opening them back up with the capability to work on modern vehicles.  They are well equipped on many levels (skills and tools), so more people are staying local.  Everest reopened their tire and repair shop and it's doing great.  Bendena has limited service, but the guy is a great mechanic and always has a wait.  The same with the guys in Highland, though they are a full service shop.  

The shop in Lancaster closed within the last year, but that was health related.  Search around and see if there is a shop in Nortonville, Winchester, Valley Falls, Perry, Easton.  My sister lives outside of Easton and the shop they use for repairs had something like a two-three week wait for issues she was having with her vehicle.  

In short, there is business to be had.  You'll find a lot of farmers in that area and people who work in Lawrence, Leavenworth, Atchison and Topeka.  

Best of luck to you!

"In addition to the many great points in the answers others gave to your question, there’s a lot to be said about shifting demographics as well. People pin a lot of the more radical conservative legislation being pushed through state houses now on Q/J6/Trumpers/etc., but I think that’s kind of missing the bigger picture. The truth is we just saw a sitting Republican president receive the most votes a candidate has ever received for the Republican Party, *and still lose*. Republicans across the country, rightly, see this next decade as their only real chance to pass through and maintain their desired legislation. They’ve always hated LGBTQ people (and yes, kids too), workers, people of color, etc., but have previously been able to rely on de facto policies and the prevalence of their base among active voters to maintain their view of the proper social order. That’s over now. So they’re going for broke and attempting to make that de facto social order into a de jure one.

Kansas is no different. We’ve swung towards Democrats in both 2018 and 2020 compared to 2016 (even if we still elected Republicans overall).

"Remember the guys involved in Unite the Right, QAnon, and J6?

Basically, they saw that their proclivities for violence made getting out onto the streets in national actions counterproductive because they got bad press, ended up with prison sentences, or were financially ruined due to [lawsuits and civil suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sines_v._Kessler). They turned to local ""politics"" instead.

So, they decided to go after local organizations like libraries and schools to ram their agendas through. They realized these organizations were ill-equipped to handle a mass-onslaught of angry organizing and veiled threats, and that controlling these organizations would either hurt ""woke"" ""liberals"" or get their own agenda instituted at a local level (probably both). This became a popular idea among the Far-Right and spawned multiple groups dedicated to this initiative. Because this initiative has grown so popular, right-wing legislators and other prominent right-wing groups are responding by publicly supporting it.

Areas with an embedded culture of community grassroots activism (for example, coastal California and much of the Northeast) are doing pretty good at resisting these folks. But areas that traditionally don't have a solid network of grassroots community activism (much of Kansas) are struggling to respond.

The best solution is to develop a robust network of community activism across Kansas communities. Unfortunately, it seems that a lot of Kansans tend to view activists as rabble-rousers and aren't sure how to feel about them.

TL;DR - these bills are created by a new wave of ""enthusiasm"" for local political intervention by people you _probably_ don't want anywhere near local government.

* The groups founded to advance these efforts are [very new (often about 1 year old) and oftentimes members don't have kids in the school systems they are targeting](https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/who-behind-attacks-educators-and-public-schools)
* These groups and efforts are supported by familiar faces from [domestic extremist organizations](https://www.google.com/amp/s/chicago.suntimes.com/education/2021/11/21/22789363/gender-queer-proud-boys-downers-grove-north-south-culture-wars-school-board-illinois%3f_amp=true). As we've seen from the recent Unite the Right trial in Virginia and is becoming increasingly apparent from the J6 investigation, these types of groups often closely collaborate and their members are often involved in multiple similar groups.
* A key component of this strategy is threats and harassment, and it's so severe that the federal government is investigating. It isn't surprising because far-right groups have a history of [casually discussing harassment and violence in ""private"" communications](https://www.wired.com/story/leaked-alt-right-chat-logs-are-key-to-charlottesville-lawsuits/). Infiltration of private chat groups thereby obtaining messages showing violent intent has been a key component in a number of cases and trials (including the aforementioned Sines v.

"If you plan your trip right you can go the River Run in Wichita, Kansas. It happens during Riverfest, a nine day festival that celebrates the Arkansas river. Wichita is technically the largest city in Kansas and the run path takes you through downtown Wichita, surrounding areas and the major landmarks of the Wichita area.
