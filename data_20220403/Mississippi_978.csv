"Posted this on her FB page yesterday.  Got the usual responses from her bootlickers:

So you’re spitting mad that your district lines were changed and that puts you at a disadvantage.

  
Remember ten years ago you sat on the committee to redistrict #37, and you and your party adjusted the number of Blacks in the district downward 1500 voting-age residents? Edward Killelea does.

  
In fact you signed on to adjust District 37 to, actually, below the statewide percentage of Blacks, even though you needed the population of mostly Black Adams County to make your district work.

  
I know this is Greek to a lot of Mississippians, but we both know how it happened and why. The math said it should give you a 1500-vote advantage if those voters voted somewhere else. Since not all would vote, it could only be expected to give you less than half that, but you had won by less than 500 votes in that first election.

  
By all accounts it should have made you electable to move the votes.

  
But you failed to win the next election because people liked Senator Dearing better. That was the last time district lines were redrawn, so it’s not ancient history.

  
The voters moved were sent to a majority minority district already Black and they were taken out of our competitive district. It’s the same as taking away somebody’s vote to send them to a noncompetitive district where their vote won't count. You sat on the committee that did that, and you were the primary beneficiary.

  
That’s not a fair or decent thing to do, to waste 1500 people’s votes to give you a better chance. But we all know that’s Mississippi politics and we all know keeping Black and democratic representation below what the numbers say it should be is how we do it here.

  
When you lost to Senator Dearing despite moving those voters, you tried to have a precinct of mostly Black votes thrown out based on groundless accusations against the poll workers. You challenged the election that way and no one on the panel supported you. You cost those poor ladies legal fees for nothing and cost the state thousands to have the hearing. And you failed.  


Now you're the victim of something you've used repeatedly against others. When it was time to collapse a district yours was chosen, and even if it goes to the other side, Republicans are still more than in charge of the Senate. Only you will be gone.

  
People say it's obvious why your district was chosen. You can't get along with people. Your politics are divisive. You hate democrats right out the gate, and that’s about 44% of your constituents. Republicans who disagree with you are RINOs. You accuse Lt. Gov. Hoseman of being a democrat.

  
And you're still doing it. You’ve already cranked up your divisive nastiness in social media. It’s like this is your only trick. It's like you learned everything at Donald Trump's knee.  
Nobody is being any less fair to you than you've been to others.

  
You're the last person who should complain about a gerrymander, Even if your constituents are underinformed about what you did or you appeal to people who don’t notice or care, other politicians do notice. And care.

  
It’s not too late to prove anyone wrong, but you're not behaving gracefully about this. The rest of government actually is being polite to you. People aren’t telling you to your face they don’t like you, they just want you gone. You brought this on yourself.

  
Fighting and name calling will only hurt your remaining time as senator. Besides, as someone mentioned last week, drawing the lines to further a state senator's career is not why we should be drawing district lines.

  
If you cared about representative democracy you’d care more about the people in your state that don’t get representation. I think it would be better if you just stopped with the divisive rhetoric.

  
You should take the rest of your term and actually work for democracy. Don’t inflame dishonest divisions — it hurts your state to do that, and it's your state for whom you are supposedly working. All of your state, not just the part you like.",t2_55p3ohkb,Wisteriously,0,1648908567.0,0,t1_i33y9lc,i33y9lc,True,Wisteriously,t3_ts7lca,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/ts7lca/black_and_white_and_sen_melanie_sojourners_red/,Black and White and Sen.

"I’m allergic to literally everything. My allergist told me he’s never had another patient who tested positive to every allergen. 😭 Here’s what he told me to do:

* Strip off your shoes and clothes at the door. Put your clothes directly into the washing machine. Treat them gently and don’t shake them to avoid spreading pollen. 

* Don’t bring anything inside that has pollen on it, especially not into your bedroom. This includes handbags, backpacks and shopping bags. 

* Immediately take a shower and wash your hair when you come home. Don’t sit or lie down on your furniture before doing this! Also wash your eyeglasses, if you wear them, and clean your phone, watch and/or fitbit. 

* Use a neti pot. Make sure you use boiled, cooled water to avoid contracting a serious infection.

I only do some of these steps, but I find that showering, washing my hair and washing my glasses when I come in helps a lot. During severe allergy times, I don’t wear anything more than once and that helps a lot, too.",t2_13xg4z,MildredMay,0,1648769533.0,0,t1_i2wyumt,i2wyumt,True,SalParadise,t3_tt3x30,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/tt3x30/as_someone_whos_never_really_had_seasonal/,"As someone who's never really had seasonal allergies before this year, I have to ask - how long does this go on?",/r/mississippi/comments/tt3x30/as_someone_whos_never_really_had_seasonal/i2wyumt/,2,r/mississippi,0,2

"Reeves and republicans will hide this fact:  In 2021 democrats passed the American Rescue Plan.  Not one republican voted for it’s passage claiming it is example of tyrannical socialism.  

Not sure why they are against so called socialism as MS annually receives $6,880 per person, which totals $38 billion.

This is over 25% of the states operating budget.  MS does not tax, and/or collect enough in taxes or reduce an equivalent in spending.  

The American Rescue Plan also provided 2021/2022  $6 billion for Covid relief most to be distributed to local cities to use to aid citizens. Part of it:  $258 million for smaller cities,  $97 million for K-12 
education, primarily to be disbursed to local school districts.

Point being education, healthcare, and other important areas should improve at practically no cost.

Stay weather aware on Wednesday. Have a way to hear tv or radio broadcasts if the power goes out. Make sure you have shoes on if you're under a tornado warning.

"> 100k is barely middle class in most places and they pay more in taxes than most people in Mississippi earn.

I have no idea what your definition of middle class is, but nationwide median household income is around $68,000. (Didn’t see average right off.)

MS is $66,000 average. Median $45,000. (Fat fingered that originally.)

Are you just talking about your personal experience or do you have some information that supports that claim?

 >The Kansas experiment refers to Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117, a bill signed into law in May 2012 by Sam Brownback, governor of the state of Kansas. It was one of the largest income tax cuts in the state's history. The Kansas experiment has also been called the ""Great Kansas Tax Cut Experiment,"" the ""Red-state experiment,"" ""the tax experiment in Kansas,"" and ""one of the cleanest experiments for how tax cuts affect economic growth in the U.S."" The cuts were based on model legislation published by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), supported by supply-side economist Arthur Laffer, and anti-tax leader Grover Norquist.

"Dear lord you people are just looking for something to complain about and then when you complain it doesn't even make sense.

The state has had a few years of budget surpluses, have a couple billion extra in the bank, and are projecting more surpluses in the future. That is called responsible legislating in my book. So now they have two options, find more shit to spend money on or cut taxes. With how wasteful governments are spending money on shit I'm absolutely OK with them giving some of it back to the people. Yes there are a thousand things that could be improved, but giving your people more of the money back is one of them too.

Second, multiple states including quite a few near us in the South, have already gotten rid of income tax, cut it way back, or are seriously talking about it. Yes, income tax is a factor that people consider when deciding where to live and take a job. Because our neighbors are changing, soon it would be yet another negative keeping people away if we didn't do this.

No, this bill doesn't help the very poorest people in the state who pay no income taxes, but you can't focus every single bill on them.

The average income in Mississippi is 25,000.  People who make 100k feel smug and act like they are rich and better than everyone else.  100k is barely middle class in most places and they pay more in taxes than most people in Mississippi earn.

If you want growth you need people with high paying jobs.  If Mississippi literally cancelled all state and corporate income taxes in Mississippi they would still come out ahead in the budgets with businesses and high earners moving themselves and their money to the state.

Nothing should be holding back Mississippi other than the outdated perceptions and clueless elected officials.  Tennessee and Georgia were just as racist at one time, but they are not holding on to the past.  Most people in MS aren't even racist, but that's the impression the rest of the country has because no one wants to visit to find out.

"Just for perspective Mississippi is #3 on the list of states in 2021 that received the most federal assistance money. 

Also, keep in mind the people who wrote this bill, passed it, and those who benefit the most from this tax cut are in no danger of running out of gas on their way to work (and are not affected at all by the rise and fall of gas prices), no danger of running out of food for the week, they aren't financially crippled by a medical expense and can always afford their medications, and aren't in danger of losing their job if they get in a car accident. They can afford clothes for their children and school expenses without sacrificing anything. They attend fancy dinners that cost more than you might make in a year just to attend. And too often they were just born into that situation. This tax cut will not affect their daily lives except to make them more money than you would. But it will cause problems within the state.

"Ah, yes. States with a larger population, booming tourism industry, far better job prospects, accessible and quality education are comparable to MS. Please, those states have higher tax rates across the board than MS, and for good reason. 

MS refused to diversify itself from the only thing it was good at pre and post Civil War - cotton. They invested heavily in that industry which only made its fall even harder as it’s neighbors leveraged their other resources: Louisiana had it’s oil/gas supplies, Alabama built-up with NASA, Georgia had Atlanta and Savannah as major investment hubs. 

MS has been gutted as an example of conservative fiscal policy for decades - failing infrastructure, failing public school systems, lack of outside investment interests leading to stagnant/falling wages which then result in further funding losses in an already-faltering economy. In the end, MS is the purest example of why low-tax/no-tax states ultimately fail. 

It’s been demonstrated for decades that tax cuts do not help spur growth nor do they help the average person. They’re crafted the benefit the rich, while doing little, if anything, for the middle class. For example, the Trump tax cuts that were portrayed as a means of helping the economy through job creation, innovation, and would result in wage increases saw negligible aid come to the actual middle class. In fact, the middle class is expected to foot the bill through increasing tax rates. 

Tax cuts as a whole, and trickle-down economics at-large, is a sham designed to move wealth from the middle class to the upper class.

"The two aren't mutually exclusive. There are definitely problems in Mississippi, but analyze this headline critically.

The exact quote regarding who Foster thinks should be shot is “Some of y’all still want to try and find political compromise with those that want to groom our school aged children and pretend men are women, etc,”

He later clarifies slightly on the latter group by saying “The law should be changed so that anyone trying to sexually groom children and/or advocating to put men pretending to be women in locker rooms and bathrooms with young women should receive the death penalty by firing squad.”

This makes it clear that the issues he's concerned with are the following. 1. Parents who encourage young children to identify as trans regardless of whether those children express any such feelings. 2. Blanket allowing without question any person who claims to be a woman into spaces where women and girls are vulnerable. Wherever you stand on these issues, you have to acknowledge that the people referred to who have these beliefs are materially different from those referred to by the phrase ""trans rights supporters"". To most people the latter phrase conjures mental images of anyone who just thinks trans people should be able to transition and live their lives in peace.

The violence espoused by this point of view is bad enough that it doesn't need to be exaggerated to make for an adequately angering headline. However, there is room to exaggerate as the MFP demonstrates.

The headline they chose says that this person wants to shoot ""trans rights supporters and political foes"". They know full well that this headline will generate more clicks than one that uses more accurate language. However, they also know that many people are just going to read the headline and not the article, and come away thinking that Mississippians are okay with shooting people who simply believe that trans people should be able to transition and live their lives in peace. The ""political foes"" line is even more of a stretch from the statements made by Foster.

As one headline this could be chalked up to poor writing, but the MFP does this consistently. Their articles are regularly posted on this and other subreddits and regularly follow this same pattern. Headlines of this style do real damage, both in terms of allowing outsiders to continue to perceive Mississippi as worse than it actually is, and by allowing fringe elements who really do believe terrible things like this to believe they have any sort of popular support. The MFP seems fine with this brand of irresponsible journalism and the damage it causes.",t2_71not2fc,Illustrious_Ad_1256,0,1648413181.0,0,t1_i2cturn,i2cturn,False,601Ninjas,t3_to8cb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/to8cb3/exgop_gov_candidate_calls_for_firing_squad_for/,"Ex-GOP Gov Candidate Calls For ‘Firing Squad’ For Trans Rights Supporters, Political Foes",/r/mississippi/comments/to8cb3/exgop_gov_candidate_calls_for_firing_squad_for/i2cturn/,-3,r/mississippi,0,-3

"This is so dumb and I do not understand why Jackson is so obsess with making it happen.

34% of our revenue is income taxes. We already have a government that doesn’t do shit. 

On one hand, If our government doesn’t do shit, they might as well quit taxing us. 

On the other hand, I worry that cutting the income tax will cause us to struggle to fund what little the government does.

I also worry of us ending up like Kansas. States like Tennessee, Florida, and Texas up their taxes in other ways. There is zero chance we do that, and if we just cut cut cut with no way to make up the revenue we’ll end up seeing all the problems Kansas does.

"I'm by no means upset, I wouldn't give you or his other ignorant supporters that satisfaction. It saddens me that such ignorance is so wide spread in the State my parents choose to raise me in. It's clear to anyone that has bothered to educate themselves that the surplus of money is from the infusion of cash from the Federal government. And THE only reason that it's trickled back to Jackson via the tax vehicle is because the Fed's had the good sense to send it directly to individuals to the most part. No state outside Alaska has successfully repealed their income tax and made it work. Anyone that believes MS will succeed can't see the forest for the trees. Ms enacted laws to authorize gambling close to 30 years ago and that was going to do so many great and wonderful things for us, what happened? The legislature can't even fund the education system as required by their OWN law AND we just enacted laws to authorize the lottery. There's no way under the sun that we eliminate the income tax and it not come back to bite us in the ass.

"100% spot on. When you see people like Tate or Hines-Smith get elected, you know it's a huge uphill battle. I have some family that are hardcore Republicans, and it's mindboggling the mental-gymnastics they'll go through when they talk about politics. 

Them: I vote Republican because I want smaller government and value freedom!

Me: Cool! So, when you voted for Trump and he added trillions to the deficit, banned bump stocks, expanded background checks, renewed the Patriot Act, and refused to pardon Assange, you must have been really pissed at him.

Them: Well Obama.....yada yada yada

And, to be fair - so many people are like that when it comes to politics. When you call out the BS of their party, you end up getting a retort of ""Well Obama...."" or ""Well Trump..."" and the entire time I'm thinking it must be rough to have to defend the actions of someone you ""support"" by excusing their actions because it was the same thing that someone you ""don't support"" did. 

From my experience, it's really difficult to talk politics with conservatives. You and I have had some exchanges on here, and while we disagree on solutions, we mostly agree on what we see as existing problems. And, I think that's a big part of changing the culture - getting people to recognize that a problem exists first. Once they understand that there is a problem, then fight it out over a solution (one that doesn't end up hurting any individual).

When it comes to this state, it's remarkably frustrating. Tater is in over his head so much, and has just coasted by his entire career without ever accomplishing a single thing. Like with the MM Initiative - even though the overwhelming majority of the state voted for it, he dug his heels in because he's worried about his status in the GOP and thinking he's gonna hitch his wagon to Trump for greener pastures. When, truthfully, any advisor for Trump would most likely tell him to stay clear of someone with a room temperature IQ like Tater. 

I honestly don't know of any solution other than changes at local levels. I think investing resources and energies at those levels will have more success than higher levels (such as governor - even though Hood came really close). Get folks into supervisory positions, into mayoral elections, auditor positions, etc.., and start taking those steps one at a time.

"The real challenge is getting the majority of voters in Mississippi to care. Just look at our elected officials now. It's not a stretch to say these guys will get re-elected. Maybe not Tate but basically Tate with a different coat of paint. There is a cultural problem in this state that prevents meaningful progress in any way. Maybe it's religion, mixed with overall poverty, brain drain, and a toxic dose of right-wing rage media keeping voters here in a perpetual state of panic and anger at anyone who doesn't keep the status quo (and the politicians who benefit from that mindset). I dunno. But I do know nothing is going to change for the better in this state until the hearts and minds of the people who vote here change.

"It’s not that I don’t agree with you. I don’t think spanking kids is good parenting. There are times though when you use other methods but they have no affect. The real problem isn’t “spanking your kids is bad” but the problem is that people don’t know the proper when and how to use spanking as a disciplinary measure.

1.) Don’t use spanking as the only form of punishment, it should be a very last resort. And I mean literally a very very last resort. 

2.) Don’t hit your kid hard enough to actually hurt them. The point isn’t to physically harm them, if you were to hit another person that hard (or yourself) and it would hurt, then you’re not disciplining them, you’re abusing them.

3.) You don’t have to spank them every single time. Sometimes just telling them that they are going to get a spanking if they continue to be bad will be enough to make them stop. Yes I know it’s because of the “fear and anxiety” of being spanked previously, but that’s the same method we use to prevent them from doing things such as touching a hot stove top. The fear of burning their hand is what is used to prevent them from placing their hand on it and when/if they do, then they will have actual trauma added to it as well. 

I don’t like spanking my children. The problem is sometimes they just do not listen, ever. I used to tell people they must be bad parents if they can’t control their children until I had my own and quickly realized that sometimes there is no controlling them. You can say whatever you want to them and they will not listen to you. You can take whatever away from them and they won’t care. You can put them in time-out and unless you are standing right behind them staring at them as well, they will try to find a way out of it without you knowing. 

I will say that time-out (standing in a corner facing the wall) works best in my experience with my own kids. Having to sit still for longer than 10 seconds will drive any child crazy and they almost instantly regret whatever they did.",t2_fwdmyg5e,DonksterWasTaken,0,1648146736.0,0,t1_i1youp4,i1youp4,False,ThatGuy_79_1,t3_tku6gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississippi/comments/tku6gz/with_domestic_violence_so_high_in_mississippi_we/,With domestic violence so high in Mississippi we should be trying more things to protect women and children!
