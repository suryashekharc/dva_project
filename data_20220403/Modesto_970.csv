"I just checked the U-Haul website, and they're quoting well under $100 for one day. Are you planning on leaving the auto trailer in Arizona? If so then that's why it costs so much. The volume of people leaving California is far higher than the volume of people coming to the state. As a consequence, there are far more one-way rentals out of the state than there are coming in. This leaves U-Haul dealers in California with a shortage of rental vehicles, so they have to pay someone to bring them back.

To see what I mean, try pricing your rental using the same vehicles but traveling one-way in the opposite direction - Arizona to California. You'll probably find it's dramatically cheaper.

You may end up driving both cars to Arizona.",t2_7ftiqi5t,Bo_Jim,0,1648756647.0,0,t1_i2w2whq,i2w2whq,False,[deleted],t3_tt6j1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Modesto/comments/tt6j1c/need_a_4_wheel_car_trollycarrier_for_move_does/,Need a 4 Wheel car trolly/carrier for move does anyone personally rent them out?,/r/Modesto/comments/tt6j1c/need_a_4_wheel_car_trollycarrier_for_move_does/i2w2whq/,2,r/Modesto,0,2

"Was the parking lot packed? I'm just wondering if the bulk of the crowd was watching a different film, or if the theater in general was low on attendance. If the parking lot was packed, yet nobody was in the theater, then it makes me wonder where all those people are going when they park there. I noticed it again on Saturday night. The entire lot directly in front of the theater was packed full.

Like I said, I live very close to that theater, but still haven't gone back since they reopened. It's not the condition of the theater (which I think is pretty good), or even the food (which I've already said completely sucks, but I can eat somewhere else before or after watching a film). My biggest fear is still COVID. I'm fully vaxxed and boosted, and I wear a mask indoors when there's more than a few people, even though it's no longer required, but I'm still not ready to take the risk. I had COVID back in early 2021 - the original strain. It was not fun, but I got through it without needing to be hospitalized. I'm not sure I'd be so lucky the second time around. My age and existing health conditions make me a higher risk.

It could be that other people feel the same way I do, and aren't ready to take a risk on getting COVID if they don't have to. It could also be that some people got used to streaming instead of going to the theater during the pandemic, and they don't really miss it. Remodeling the theater wouldn't bring those people back.",t2_7ftiqi5t,Bo_Jim,0,1647902064.0,0,t1_i1l88bl,i1l88bl,False,EthanGuyTheMovie,t3_ti476t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Modesto/comments/ti476t/regal_mchenry_renovation/,Regal Mchenry renovation?,/r/Modesto/comments/ti476t/regal_mchenry_renovation/i1l88bl/,2,r/Modesto,0,2

I have definitely noticed the regal mchenry go down on quality on attendance. I went to see jackass 4 on opening night there and usually it‚Äôs packed for those kinds of movies but when we went it was a ghost town and keep in mind it was a Friday night.

"I live near the Regal on McHenry. It doesn't look like they're having any problem filling seats. There's a stretch of parking lot that extends to the north that never fills up, or gets a few people living in their cars plus overflow parking from the two mobile home parks. That's the section of the parking lot that hosts car shows. But the main part of the lot in front of the theater is usually pretty much packed on Friday and Saturday evenings now.

I've seen theaters go through the death spiral before. They put off doing necessary repairs. They don't fix broken seats. They don't replace worn carpeting. Attendance drops off, which reduces revenues, which means even more urgent maintenance gets put off. Eventually, people stop coming, and the theater is forced to close. I remember one that tried to get attendance back up without actually fixing anything by using half of the rooms for Bollywood movies. I remember one Indian attendee saying ""It was 100% authentic. Just like a theater in the Mumbai slums."". Not exactly an enthusiastic endorsement. That was in the Bay Area, by the way.

I haven't been in the Regal on McHenry since before COVID, which is kind of ironic since I can literally walk there. I don't remember it being anywhere near as badly in need of maintenance as the ones that are headed into that death spiral. Maybe I wasn't paying close attention.",t2_7ftiqi5t,Bo_Jim,0,1647880011.0,0,t1_i1jphqu,i1jphqu,False,EthanGuyTheMovie,t3_ti476t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Modesto/comments/ti476t/regal_mchenry_renovation/,Regal Mchenry renovation?,/r/Modesto/comments/ti476t/regal_mchenry_renovation/i1jphqu/,2,r/Modesto,0,2

"TL;DR: Schools are overrated, but let me tell you how I had trouble and failed a couple times and what I did to not fail the last time around, so that it might help you and someone else.

P.S. One of my parents, over 30 years before I got my license, practised with Love's Driving School while in Turlock, at around the same age that I finally got my license. That school has been around for a loooong time. My other parent, like me, never went through any formal driver's education programme before taking their test.

[The rest of this story is unnecessarily long to answer your question directly, but may be of use.]

As someone else said if you are over 18 and you have an insured and properly registered vehicle (with no cracks on the windshield, even little tiny ones less than the size of a penny -- and yes, I actually had to reschedule for that once, and working lights/windshield wipers (they will even test it when the weather is very good at Noon)) then you can drive your final driving test after writing your paper test (most often, done on the computer now).

Similar to what someone else again said, I drove with parents and a cousin first in Johansen's parking lot on the weekends (thanks to Modesto City Schools for keeping such a big parking lot open for people to practice -- I am certainly not the only person I saw there) and then with that same cousin (as my parents were still scared of my driving) on city streets in the relatively quiet business neighbourhood between Bangs and Union just behind McHenry to the left (when driving in the Standiford to Palendale avenue direction). This was all many years ago, so idk how that is now. But it did give me the basics of driving before I left for college for a number of years.

Then, in late summer 2019 (just before summer break ended), I started driving a few more times in Johansen High's parking lot (this time in my 20s), and as the weather became worse in autumn and early winter, did a lot more driving on McHenry and Palendale for the most part (and some smaller streets to and from places) to practice driving with signalling, traffic lights, stop signs, rain, and such). I took my first exam in Merced in December 2019, and did alright (I had near-maximum technical mistakes allowable), except that I had no clue what to do when a vehicle suddenly barrelled through a four-way stop-sign intersection and we nearly got T-boned since I had assumed they would have stopped and I had already properly done my stop at the sign. That interaction not only auto-failed me (it's one of those 'dangerous manoeuvrers' -- check out a blank copy of the driving examiner's rubric on Google Images or something for the full list), but it is the direct reason I think I now usually wait for the oncoming traffic at 90 degrees in each side to actually stop at their line before I go forwards now. (I don't think that's an actual _law_ that anyone drives like that, but ... it is just what happened to me.)
If you take the test in Merced, know that while a lot of streets in our downtown and McHenry are closer to a 30-speed limit, most of theirs were 40. Apparently, my 'slow driving' was a thing my examiner really hated about me and I heard her chew me out about it and the whole near-miss T-bone thing 
(but hey, at least I sped through that intersection fast enough that we never did actually get hit..)

I tried again after gathering my wits in June of 2021. By then, I had driven most streets in Modesto and parts of Riverbank and Ceres at least once and had reviewed the proper distance for stopping near any train tracks and what to do if I was behind city or school buses. I had also started driving freeways and had driven up north to Manteca (and back down to Modesto from Citrus Heights), east to Santa Clara and up to Redwood City, and south to Merced. That time, I tested at the Modesto DMV, and frankly, that examiner did her darnedest to make me feel the most nervous. She was not thrilled that I stopped at a four-way stop-sign intersection a few blocks away from the DMV on my way back and waited there for so long that the FedEx truck 90 degrees to me gave me a go-ahead hand wave after he stopped, but I was then kindly informed that I auto-failed after driving the whole thing through (with better results than the first time around, maybe 7 technical marks instead of the 14 or so I had the first time) because I wasn't looking at all my mirrors enough.

[There's a video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M-Kcq2U6CI) that goes over how to properly 'Scan. Scan. Scan.' and talks about how examiners can't see your eyeballs, so make the movements of your head obvious, keeping in mind that the driver's test is what it is -- a performance exam. Make a TSA-level theatrical performance about moving your head (but don't be a metal rock band guitarist either -- you got to be able to focus on things that you see when you move your head). Anyway, so I failed that second time too...

Now, most anyone here (probably yourself included OP) knows that the provisional license certificate for learners that you get from passing a written test is only good for 1 year and 3 tests, whatever comes first.
So after watching the video on YouTube I linked above (to know what all the other auto-fails were, mostly, and just what examiners are thinking) and some videos for Tracy and Visalia (I thought they had better examiners from what I read on Yelp, to be quite honest) [driving test routes](https://www.youtube.com/c/DMVRoadTestVideos), I booked the third exam for Tracy and practised driving a few of the routes a couple of separate times on different weekends.

The day before the exam, however, on my way to a grocery store, a tan Chevy suburban kicked up a small rock into the windshield we had just replaced days before and it made a small penny-sized crack and dent on the driver's side. Curses. But c'est la vie, and I cancelled my driver's appointment. 

My parents had a second car at home, a minivan, and I started practising using that vehicle instead. It was a different angle, different width, and different length, and by then, I had a little over a month (about 5 weeks) to schedule my third exam. I immediately scheduled for Visalia (Tracy was booked solid to well into a month after when my permit would have expired, although coronavirus meant that permits were being extended anyway since the first half of 2020 saw a stop on most all driver's tests -- not that I knew about that) on the very last day possible (the one year anniversary of the learner's permit), and after driving the second car around town, and on some freeways, and on Visalia routes (found from the YouTube channel linked above and other videos), I started an early morning drive one morning to make a later-morning test appointment there. State Highway 99 had construction just before Visalia at that time, and I barely made it there with more like 40 minutes to spare, instead of the 1.5 hours where I planned to drive another time around the region, but I had already driven the whole way there with my parent in the car (you have to have a licensed driver with you when driving with your permit) so I figured I might be as ready as possible.

Regardless, I did ask them what the speed limit was in the immediate vicinity of the region, and they confirmed that there was no posted speed limit and requested that I recall what the default speed limit is in California when there is not a posted speed. What they will _not_ tell you (and what apparently they say trips up a lot of driver candidates) is that shortly after you leave the parking lot and travel northbound to a major road near and parallel to SR99, there _is_ a speed limit 30 sign that will _increase_ the speed you should travel at. If you don't make an effort to press the gas a bit there, they will mark that off on the sheet and you will get a 'tsk tsk' attitude after that from your examiner (during the post-drive review). They then had me checking my mirrors and signaling constantly on an in-town freeway (I forget its number) and I think I travelled a good 4 lanes left, then 3 lanes right, then 2 lanes left again, then 3 lanes right, and then 2 lanes left again, and then back those 2 lanes before we turned into a residential section for the backup test. Review the videos about these, but it's not parallel parking here in California, so it shouldn't be hard stuff.

They then took me on a more relaxing and scenic route back, and I was informed that my obvious mirror looking and head travel, careful driving (finally someone appreciated that I like to drive on the slower side of traffic), and very good lane handling (as nervous as I was moving a total 12+ lanes weaving in and out of empty lanes with traffic behind me that had been stopped at a red signal for most of that time, I did a good job of it) was what led them to give me the pass.

I still had a few technical errors, mostly in angling and such from the 50 feet backup part, but the report was mostly clean that time. I went back into the office, got my picture taken, and a couple of weeks later (despite being warned that there was a delay due to the stopped driving test and COVID WFH stuff) I did get my license in the mail. I admittedly did not drive back home after that ... my parent was with me, so we went to a couple of big-box retailer places in Visalia and Tulare (the city south of Visalia) and then my parent drove me back as I was already quite tired and nerved from the whole test thing.

Shortly after that, my parents' age started showing and I do a lot of the driving now, so I can only say that I am glad I got the driving test done when I did.

As for this response being long ... yes, I know. I guess if that's a problem, then come at me bro? with downvotes?

"You have my full attention. I‚Äôm honestly trying to understand, not just be argumentative.  A few questions (if you prefer to have this discussion privately will you email me at AnnieInvestigates@gmail.com). 

Is the video still posted where she said she found him safe and living with someone and he doesn‚Äôt wish to be contacted? Are you referring to the video about him having a female friend that was helping him? I was under the impression that his mom has had zero contact with him since the day he went missing and her only information was from someone who said they talked to him. Is that false?

I understand the system in place. I also know that the police, for the most part, are not qualified to help people with mental illness, especially extreme symptoms like paranoia. I have worked in healthcare and specifically in mental health for years, I know how patients can get and sometimes they get it twisted in their mind. I also realize there is probably a lot that is NOT being said. Do you know Dane personally and are commenting specifically about his personal situation or is this coming from a broader context and being involved in a similar situation? If you have information that Dane‚Äôs family is harmful to his wellbeing, please let me know that. 

I want what is best for Dane and if he is mentally stable and taking good care of his mental health then there is no need for family intervention. However, if he is mentally unwell and not actively in some kind of treatment, that is very dangerous for him and a poor outcome in the long run. My concern is for Dane. I have zero ties to his family or him. I don‚Äôt know any of them. Something about his particular scenario, specifically about the day he went missing, made me want to help find him so help could be offered. Someone that has that deep of a paranoid thought process is unwell and needs help. Those symptoms normally don‚Äôt just go away.  I am not here to force any adult to contact someone they wish to distance themselves from but I am still concerned that Dane needs help and I feel like his family can help provide that, even if at a distance. Mental health providers are pretty good at getting to the bottom of things and I believe they would know how best to help him. Paranoia is super tricky to deal with but left unchecked/untreated can cause long term damage.",t2_7zux7j1e,dishthetea,0,1645079816.0,0,t1_hxa16sy,hxa16sy,False,dishthetea,t3_rkexzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Modesto/comments/rkexzd/pictures/,Pictures,/r/Modesto/comments/rkexzd/pictures/hxa16sy/,1,r/Modesto,0,1
"I know her @ it's how I know she said they found him safe and living with people. If he doesn't want to contact his family - he doesn't have to.

If you do see Dane & fear for his safety - you should NOT contact his mother but rather the LAPD in charge of his case. I see that you advocate for the opposite of that but calling the police can be a discreet thing and doesn't have to alert him. If he doesn't wish to have contact with his mother calling her and telling her where he is would be the absolute worst thing to do.

"Just wanted to toss my two-cents in, as I've friends who've gone with Mint who did enjoy it, but also considered [Ting.com](https://Ting.com) when I'd mentioned it.

Purchased an unlocked Galaxy A10e, and recently purchased Pixel 6 through their site (came with everything needed), and was good to go. They've got several reasonable tiers to choose from. I work remote, so went with the most reasonable plan that runs usually $16-$18 dollars a month.

No contracts, a decent app that helps you monitor usage, provide alerts, etc. I don't use it anymore, found just using the website is more than enough.

"The fluff and fold and laundry mat at Prescott and Standiford is way cheaper than the one at Prescott and Briggs more. 
If you have gas to get to the one on Coffee at Floyd and it still has free dryers if you use the washers it is the very cheapest. It's easier to go during the week days if you can. I've seen people get in shoving matches for the dryers on the weekends. I think it's one of the newest and cleanest in town. Laundry express is the name. 
They also only have the big washers starting at a two loader all the way up to 10 loaders.

"Haha, yes, that was the attitude that I had approaching this.

Much to my surprise (and considering how often I have to fight for things), their manager is very good at disarming and making you feel good.

There's a TikTok about retail that I recall watching some time ago, where there's a lady on TikTok who works at an artisan cheese shop or some bourgeoisie kiosk who will disarm such people when they come in with a complaint.

The part that always surprises me (and something I might have done, given a chance, had the manager had not quickly told the students working there to process the refund) is that the lady on TikTok will then offer her customers if they would rather complain, to get things off their chest.

"Good news for those following this story.
(and thank you to /u/mandahugandkiss for their advice -- actually, something similar had passed my mind on Monday, and I had checked, though)

The bookstore set it right with the help of a printed email from the publisher and after contacting the professor --- because the professor had himself ordered the wrong ISBN. McGraw-Hill will sell a loose-leaf textbook with references to Connect but no access code! Scandalous and outrageous.

Thankfully, the manager immediately recognised the book and noticed that as they didn't have any books with the code in them in stock, she would offer a refund. That was rather nice of her.

The following two hours were back and forth emails with the professor, and the professor has now squared together a solution to set things right for the bookstore and his students.

So, for my part, I am happy enough (despite the two and a half hours missing from my working life over this) and will be visiting again on Thursday (if they arrive quickly) or next week (otherwise), hopefully, to receive the correct book with the code this time.

(*) By pure chance, I found a lady coming out of the bookstore not long after me with a loose-leaf blue (sociology?) textbook by McGraw-Hill.
