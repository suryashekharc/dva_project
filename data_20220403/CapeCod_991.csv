There's a lot of jobs around right now. Try going through Craigslist or indeed.com. I'd be looking in the restaurant industry for dishwasher and bussing jobs. They're usually able to accommodate short shifts and you can probably get some free food. Also seriously consider how you're gonna be commuting and the distance between your jobs.

"i definitely recommend sticking to outer cape for the best “traditional” cape cod experience. mashpee and barnstable specifically are the exact opposite of traditional cape cod and actually kind of suck unless you’re going for specific things (ie the marketplace at new seabury is amazing, mashpee commons is expensive but has some great businesses, and barnstable has some restaurants that are to die for, definitely check out main street and the farmers market there! the mall isn’t great but it’s getting somewhat better) but sandwich and falmouth/woods hole are pretty good, despite not being outer cape. 

beaches- you NEED to go to marconi beach. the dunes are taller than houses and it’s just endless beach. nauset and sandy neck are also quite popular. 

restaurants- for coffee/cafes, i personally do not recommend cape cod coffee. there are a few and they even have a whole restaurant but i am not a fan of their coffee, nor are they actually the small business they make themselves seem. coffee o in falmouth/woods hole and the fox and crow in welfleet are both amazing. for sit down, definitely check out tap city grille, the sandwich taverna (shameless plug because i used to work there, we’re great) and the burger bar. anejo and sam diego’s are great mexican spots. for fast food, try the knack! provincetown also has amazing food, jimmys is popular and kung fu dumplings is my favorite spot there. 

general- we have so many amazing walking trails and nature reserves that are worth checking out. cape cod potato chip factory is so cool, although i’m unsure about their tours because of covid. there’s a dinner train you can take in the summer in hyannis that i’ve been told is a great experience. the canal has a super cute museum and great walking trails. i recommend going right on the trail, towards sandwich and walking out onto the jetty!

"Great Whites are on the outer arm of the cape.  Hyannis is a nice day walk, as is Falmouth.  Falmouth also has a mini marathon road race in early August that is a fun event.  Provincetown is a blast, and Truro Vineyards is nice (Cape Cod Winery is nice too).  Cape Cod Potato Chip factory is next to the Cape Cod Brewery in Hyannis.  I'd also suggest the Sandwich boardwalk but a winter snow storm knocked it over.  If you're looking to camp - Nickerson park.  And the Beachcomber in wellfleet is masshole central.  

Just off the cape / 'on the mainland' (i.e. before the bridge), Plymouth is a great take - downtown is fun, jetski rentals, history walk.  The canal has a long path on both sides that's great for biking and is relatively flat.  And you can take canal cruises out of Wareham (water park in Wareham, too).

"Hey so I searched the cape cod subreddit for “drugged drink, bar problem, bar issues, Mickey, slipped, roofie, roofied” and nothing came up. Going to try googling it. 

If your wife and yourself had say 3-4 beers in an hour and a full meal, she could puke, since that’s very filling and she weighs less than you. But you say she was acting way more drunk, and literally throwing up at the bar. That is bizarre. 
My only other thing is why would someone drug her? Like wouldn’t they drug the single girl at the bar? Since you, her husband, would obviously protect her and get her home safe? 

Idk if I were you I would just report the strange occurrence and give all detailed info you can to the police. Do it in the morning and think about everything.

Upon googling there have been reports of drugged drinks in Boston 4 DAYS AGO. https://boston.cbslocal.com/video/program/795/6167313-boston-police-warn-about-drinks-being-drugged-at-bars/

"I work in a psych hospital in Boston and we routinely do ECT. There is nothing controversial about the treatment and the side effects from medications can be harmful too. ECT is best for depression. You would need to go inpatient to start the treatment which if decided by the doctor that this would be the best course likely would do 6-12 treatment inpatient at a frequency of 3 x a week. Possibly transitioning to outpatient ECT after doing at least 3-4 treatment in patient and tolerating well.

"I think builders are more interested in regular housing vs affordable housing. Regarding town approval, plan is to find a lot that allows multi-family housing, there are a few I've found so far. Beyond the approval for building the houses, I would not be asking for any funding or special grants from the towns. Will subsidize the rent for the ""affordable housing"" with rent from the summer rentals. It will be a self funding subsidy. Later if we can get grants and money from the government to further subsidize, great, but not counting on. It.

The towns won’t issue permits for this, your neighbors will fight it, land is insanely expensive, good contractors are challenging to get right now, etc.

"lol, if you can afford to build a multi-million dollar vacation home (be it second, third, whatever), the amount of use you get out of it is usually secondary to the investment or tax write off. Using it is just a bonus. The big properties that were built over covid were mostly people parking some cash in a <inflation loan on an island with limited inventory, similar to those giant towers in NYC.

it's no longer really boomers - a few, sure, but boomers are in their 70's now and selling off their second properties or handing them down to the next generation. At this point it's generational wealth moving in that won't be swayed by their investment dipping, which is why they're ok buying at the top. They have the net worth to weather the incoming dip, however long it takes. 

Because so much of the real estate on cape has been bought up by other people investing like they are - think nantucket, the vineyard, etc, they're finally seeing stability in our market. Second to that you've got younger families with a bit of expendable income buying ""starter""second homes, they're buying the $500k ranches and hoping to pay the mortgage on airbnb. 

No one wants to drive anyone off cape, that'd mean they actually thought about the year-round community. It's al just selfish moves to build wealth, and in this late stage of capitalism we're in with interest rates under inflation for almost 10 years straight the accumulation of wealth at the top has sped up faster than it ever has. That's about all there is too it, it's why vacation rentals have tripled in the past 10 years on Cape and why the burrito place can only be open 4 hours a day 5 days a week.

"Great points, which lead into a bigger conversation: Cape Cod can’t tackle this disaster alone. Even Massachusetts seems to treat us like a vacation satellite, and there is no doubt a lot of money invested here by residents of other towns in-state. Even if the municipal governments had the will and teeth to make changes, there has to be a push on the state and federal level to legislate differently. The phenomenon isn’t limited to the Cape. The conversation has gotten a lot louder since the pandemic started, as other communities are really feeling the squeeze from side-effects of the “Great Migration.” Unfortunately, we’ve been uniquely positioned as a canary in the coal mine for some time, and as the national conversation heats up, we basically become a case study for what happens if it’s left unattended.

"I know I’m not quite sure *which* generation is Boomers.

"Listen as long as the boomers remain in control we will have massive gentrification and outpricing of the middle class. They've been hoarding houses for YEARS.  
 The Boomers show up to every town meeting and they have shot down the pot legalization (until the town needed some type of override and then they let the pot in because they don't want to pay for that in their taxes) 
they don't want to pay for new schools for the children either.  Selfish beyond hope. 
Basically the Boomers/Airbnb, (which half of them probably own an extra cottage down there that they rent out weekly). Don't want families except the ones they import during their vacations and their weekends there, their own. 
They want the little poor worker slobs to come in and serve them and then quietly slink away under a rock somewhere.  But they don't want them to have any place to live. 
That's why when places like Dunkin' donuts and your restaurants and your shops are all closed three four five days out of the week because they don't have the little worker slobs to come in and serve you your lattes and your ice creams I sit and I laugh.

"The family housing is fenced off, so you can't walk the streets any more, which is disappointing.  You can walk through the area with larger buildings  -- barracks, bowling alley,  energy plant, etc., but you can't get in.

Payomet has a performance space and there's a wood-fired kiln.  A few of the buildings are used for research.

Theres a neighborhood of houses surrounded by a fence, but there are some spots to crawl under. There is also a bowling alley and other activity buildings, but we never went into that area. Jenny Lind Tower is a short walk away, but was fun to check out. Besides the buildings, there is now a music stage on the baseball field, an overgrown airfield a bit further out with what appeared to be tiny bunker rooms filled with water nearby, as well as the dunes with an amazing view of the ocean.

"When I was growing up in the dark ages, Chatham was for money ""summer people,"" Harwich was solid middle class vacationers, and Dennis was working class. The housing inventory was priced accordingly.

They used to call the Cape the Irish Riviera, as they were a distinct majority of vacationers, followed by Italian Americans and the occasional Canadians, some from Quebec. 

Most were local to New England, and the 2 week vacation at a little motel or efficiency was common. You'd meet fun kids at the beach and they'd be here one day, gone the next.  Now the motels are condos.

  Then came the crush of New Yorkers.  

Now Chatham has a massive influx of Arabs and Russians (maybe not this summer 🤔) with obscene amounts of cash. 

 It wasn't like this in years past, but   this is what happens when the rich decide they want something. They did it to Montana, too. Griping won't change it. Taxing them might not either, as some seem to be laundering money.

">We don’t have any family local to the cape so I’d also be apprehensive of finding a community or way to make friends.

Don't be apprehensive, just forget about it happening period. It is extremely difficult to make or find friends if you're a young professional on Cape, even stretching ""young"" to be up to your 50s. It continues to be difficult if you have kids as families here tend to be clannish and most parents have very limited social interests beyond ""how 'bout dem Patriots.""

Food. I'll be honest, when we go on vacation, going to restaurants is really the big attraction because there's so little variety on Cape. There's obviously fried seafood and lobsters. More sophisticated contemporary American is finally getting a hold. Foreign is a wasteland. Chinese food here is still straight out 1970s Pu-Pu Platters and Chop Suey--the land Szechuan forgot.

The last time this happened was not a historical event lmao it was because of sub prime lending and inflated home prices. Similar to what’s going on right now minus the subprime (although a lot are short term variable interest rate loans which will come due in 3-5 years) when these loans come due and their houses are worth 25% less than their mortgage they’ll be screwed. Along with coming interest rate hikes will stagnate the market it’s simply not sustainable.

"Living on the Cape had it’s pros and cons, but many people are happily situated here. It’s beautiful in season and there are a lot of cool places to explore. Housing is really hard to find these days, but not impossible. It most likely factor into where you live. I think most towns are pretty nice but some are easier in terms of travel. I love Falmouth and the downtown area there but it can be a bear to go anywhere else in the summer. I live in Sandwich and love it because I’m close to the bridge when I want to go to Boston. Other towns mentioned like Harwich and Barnstable are lovely and have their  own vibe and feel. Chatham is expensive to buy but has the lowest property taxes on the Cape. As far as food goes, there are some really wonderful restaurants here but I would say they are more heavily located towards the outer and mid-cape.

"I think the main driver is how much can you afford for housing?  Are you willing to live in a condo?  Or would you prefer a house?  Housing costs vary widely. 

Do you want lots of shopping, night life, activities?  Or quiet and a bit more nature?

I think you can find yoga studios in most/many towns. So that may be less of a concern.  Plus many community centers and schools sponsor classes.

Restaurants abound, but may close for a few months in the off season. 

As for raising kids, in general,  the Cape has an aging population and is losing families and younger adults.   That said, class sizes are often small and inclusive.   Check the demographics of individual towns to find the populations with more kids.

Good luck to you, OP.   It can be tough and it can be wonderful here.

"i grew up in marstons mills for the first 20 years of my life, and i currently am living back here with mom due to all the shit in the world. i'm 36 and gay, so my outlook as a stubborn bachelor probably differs from yours, but i can't wait to get out. this place is miserable for young adults like me. the year round population here has one of the highest average ages of anywhere in the country - old people old people old people. which, that's great for them but it makes *me* feel old too. students in boston were obnoxious but being around that kinda youthful energy does rub off on  you.

if you're raising kids, that sorta domestic life probably vibes well here. my education was excellent, but there's a housing crisis that will effect every level of service because people simply can't afford to live here without making big bucks (i.e. no teachers). but i did grow up really appreciating the beauty of the land and the sensitivity of our ecology.

i don't resent growing up here - i was certainly privileged - but i am always a little jealous of my friends who grew up in more connected, urban areas. i definitely would take the cape over somewhere in remote middle america though, but that may just be my east coast snobbery talking.

not to mention trying to go anywhere in the summer kinda sucks. you really have to plan around tourist traffic.

edit: i may have been talking out of my ass a little bit regarding teachers; in fact i have heard that some schools shut down due to dwindling number of students. no idea how true that is, heard it second hand supposedly from a teacher herself. housing is definitely a problem but i'm just saying i'm not a reliable source on this stuff so ignore that",t2_7v9xysyn,dedolent,0,1647728614.0,0,t1_i1c236a,i1c236a,True,mciccar,t3_thzyva,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeCod/comments/thzyva/moving_to_the_cape/,Moving to the Cape,/r/CapeCod/comments/thzyva/moving_to_the_cape/i1c236a/,15,r/CapeCod,0,15

"Decent restaurants are easily found on Cape Cod, but there are not a lot of certain types. Indian, Cambodian, and Vietnamese restaurants are pretty much nonexistent. Things are looking up in terms of other ethnic cuisines (Peruvian, for instance, in Hyannis, at Tumi), but often the restaurants here have very similar menus. If you love to cook, you will find that houses with really good kitchens are often quite a bit pricier, since so many houses were designed for vacationers or retirees, folks who generally aren't in the market for a high quality, spacious kitchen.

Child care will be difficult to find here, but not impossible; it will probably be expensive. You should definitely scout around for it in advance so you can locate near it. Children help us form connections, so if you are starting a family, you'll find the connections may follow from the people you meet who have children of the same age.

"OP is coming to the Cape in April.  Wellfleet drive-in opens Memorial Day weekend, although the flea market is year round.   Arnold's hasn't posted their reopening date (AFAIK), but last year it was in May,

However, if you're on the outer Cape, you can see Nauset Light, which is the lighthouse thats is on the Cape Cod potato chip bags, it's at Nauset Light Beach (NLB) in Eastham (not the confusingly named Nauset Beach in Orleans).   NLB currently has a very small parking lot due to a construction project and erosion that happened during one of the winter storms, but you should be able to park there in April without a problem.

"**The Wellfleet Drive-In**. It's a little bit of a drive to get to but it's totally worth it. Place is ran by the head of the Drive-In Association of America and has a ton of fun activities around once you are in such as mini-golf and a dairy bar with classic American diner favorites. There's one big screen complete with the original sound boxes from the 1950s. Each ticket is cheap and all are a double feature often starting with a family movie and then ending with something for the adults.

It's a nice one to come a little early to. Bring some folding chairs and a portable radio. Bonus points, have a late lunch at **Arnold's Lobster & Clam Bar** and get a lobster roll before going.

Another suggestion: **The Edward Gorey House**. It's a great tribute to an eccentric children's book illustrator. He is known for comical macabre stories that influenced Tim Burton and Lemony Snicket. It's great seeing his original ink artwork and the house where he spent the last years of his life. It once belonged to a retired sea captain. It's a truly unique place that is well-worth taking a tour of.

"You're joking, but I think that's actually true.  Rhode Island, Connecticut, and especially Maine have plenty of nice beaches, but because space and access are so linited, which is the root of the traffic problem, it's much more expensive, so it's a bigger flex to talk about a Cape Cod vacation than a more affordable, enjoyable trip to Midcoast Maine. 

I'd add that the traffic doesn't seem like a problem if part of your day to day is sitting on the Southeast Distressway for 45 minutes to travel 4 miles, and you aren't used to how easy it is to get around the Cape in the off-season.

Most if these bullshit \*affordable\* housing are not affordable - they have like 2 out of 20 units at a price most can afford.  Why not 20 units people can afford....  ""Oh no that will become the projects""

**Opportunities  • Multi-family workforce housing with reduced parking requirements**

But slide 8 - this is aimed at SINGLES NOT FAMILIES!!  Unit sizes are 400 SQ FT!  SLIDE 18

"If they don't list a pay, I don't bother applying.

I always keep looking to compare my wage to what's out there, and luckily I'm in the top bracket and I like my company, but starting pay should not be a mystery or use ""upon negotiation"" as a hiring haggling piece. I should be a valued employee and not an auction piece. I also hate seeing job descriptions with multiple functions and they use ""team player"" as an excuse to clump three jobs into one. If you can't afford to hire two or three people for separate positions, you aren't a company anyone would want to work for, because I guarantee you will push more and more work as the business grows onto one person until they break.

A long time ago I tried explaining to my employer to split my job or I was going to get burned out with the workload that increased over time. They didn't listen and I left. On my exit interview I spelled out all my job duties and explained they needed to hire more people. One of my co-workers told me after I left they split my job into two full time and one part time positions. If only they had done that when I asked......

">Mind if I ask what you do for work?

Computer shit.

>Did you get a job offer before moving- or was it possible to move and then quickly find a job that affords you rent?

The latter. I had family out here but did not really need it. Jobs are plentiful, depending on what you do. Get a remote job and move, that makes it easy.

>Of all the PNW/West Coast Oregon seems like one of the, if not the best state.

It does not suck. Distances can be deceiving for east coasters moving out here. The coast is simultaneously really close and really far away from civilization. Portland's charm and its weakness lies in the fact it's not a very metropolitan sort of town.
