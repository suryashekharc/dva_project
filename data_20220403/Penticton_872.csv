"matter of perspective. Yesterday and today's weather in Vancouver : Heavy rain.

No, they are not a refreshing change from vancouvers winter. Penticton for the last 20 years is typically green through the winter, not much snow (this year was an exception). It is grey, gloomy, and brown through the winter. It isn't cold enough to maintain snowy conditions to enjoy winter activities (there are ski hills an hour drive away though). And it isn't warm enough to have the trees/shrubbery maintain green. So everything is just sort of brown through the winter.

"trust me when i tell you, that if i lived in the okanagan ( coming from a lifetime of Vancouver) and 15-20+ days out of each winter month was ''just '' cloudy'', i'd be doing cartwheels every morning i woke up. 

Living in Vancouver, where you can get the entire nov or dec/ jan with nothing but rain. And not just plain gentle rain. The rain that comes at you sideways, like water bullets, with wind up your asshole till you start whistling like a tea kettle on full boil. When the weatherman says '' Next three days in Vancouver will be mild with just clouds all day and 30% chance of precipitation!''.....you give a sigh of joy that it finally stopped raining and can go outside and do something, anything, even walk to the bank and pay a bill. 

I know allllllll about seasonal depression. I pop big doses of Vitamin d, B12, eat health(ier) , i go outside more then most people, rain or shine, walk the dog 3 times a day. Weekends might be 4 times. 

And i use a SAD lamp for at least 15+ years every morning that calls for cloudy days/rain. SAD lamp uses a lux light system to mimic the sunlight. It increases serotonin in the brain/elevates the mood. 

I actually should of been born in the okanagan  instead of Vancouver. Funny, my eldest brother was born in Oliver, we were raised in vancouver, brother retired 8 years ago and bought a condo in Penticton.

"thanks for all the helpful advice. 

I have been popping vitamin D in 5000-6000 iu for the past 8-10 years. I also use the SAD lamp every morning for 30-60 minutes whenever rainy/cloudy ( which would be about 165 days or more per year). You know, many times this idea of driving up the mountain to the ski hills to see some sunlight comes up on Reddit or facebook, castanet, etc. 

Sounds great in theory, but not so great depending on who you are and your commitments. Example, if i have an elderly mother at home, a dog to feed/walk, housework, yard work, Work-work, grocery shopping, etc....lol, only time i might scurry away is the odd moment everything lines up perfectly and could get away for 2 hours or so. Anyways, i can live with 2-3 cloudy days. Hell, i can do 3 weeks of straight cloudy days. In Vancouver, it can be hurricane rainy weather, i'm outside walking the dog. Soon as it stops raining and just cloudy/windy, i'm outside doing anything i can just to be outside. Better then being indoors, lack of natural light and stale air. 

If i lived in Penticton, i think i'd just drive to kelowna now and then to get something more big city and for variety.

"thanks for your excellent reply.

So regular gasoline is now $2.13 / L Vancouver. Because of the transit taxes and just plain greed, we will always be the most expensive in north america, regardless of oil refinery maintenance issues or russia being shitty dickheads. Gas Buddy has Penticton gas prices currently at $1.89 to 1.96. I think in time, the gas prices will go back down and maybe Penticton will hover from $1.30-1.45. ...while Vancouver will just continue to be the big ripp off as ever, maybe going down to $1.80 or $1.65. 

If i could afford a new vehicle, i'd buy a hybrid and see some fuel savings.

You mentioned the rent for a one bdrm in Penticton of $1200...that seems cheap as i keep reading Penticton is averaging $1400-1500/month. Vancouver average is anywhere from $1800-2200. And not talking about west side, near downtown, new-luxury. Even BBY, new west, coq and probably Surrey is hovering around the $1600-2000. One may ''luck '' out and pay $1500-1700 for a shitty bsmnt suite that will have a host of issues, crummy area and or a lousy landlord. Plus the threat of renovictions.

A big stress inducer here is the traffic and the bad drivers, the hunting for parking, the wondering if your vehicle got broken into or ticketed/towed. 

I am used to a quiet type of lifestyle so Penticton is not a place i'm hoping to move to for the bar/nightclub scene or 24 restaurant-nightlife . I have visited there many times in the summer months and i find it can be a dead quiet town that seems to shut down at 5pm except for some big brand stores, some restaurants. Even the mall closes at 9pm and is kinda dull. Not bitching, lol, actually after 53 years of life in Vancouver, i'm tired of large crowds, line ups, rudeness, coldness, belligerent aloof attitudes. 

\- A few things i would miss from metro vancouver that you just do not get in Penticton and even kelowna : international culture, immigrant neighborhoods such as little india, koreatown, chinatown, night markets, flipino eateries/bakeries...and much more. I'm sure you know what i mean. Finding little hole in the wall mom/pop business, little bargain type store, produce stores. And the beaches/ the pacific ocean, white rock, seafood, etc, the options for malls, mechanics, , you name it, that come with a big metro area. 

I may have t relocate to Vernon if i get priced out of Penticton. Will need to rent a house for myself, elderly mother, older retired brother and a near 4 year old Husky. 

If penticton has no viable housing for us, nor jobs.... Vernon next on the list ( we ruled out Kelowna...too pricey, too Surrey-esque in some ways, too flashy and becoming too metro city like) 

PS, i watch the Penticton and kelowna live cams everyday for the past 4 years. There were days calling for rain/clouds and it was sunny...very often. Summerland/Penticton winters have gotten very mild compared to the 1960s/1970s and even the 1980s.

"I’d agree with mykidsarecrazy. The rentals are few and definitely a landlords market — and I would compare living in Oliver/Osoyoos or Peachland/Westbank/Summerland as being much like how people live and work on the coast. 
(My brother for instance lives in New West but works in Coquitlam.) the commute is easy and beautiful here, if you have a car (transit isn’t an option between towns). 

Everyone is hiring here, but it’s a lot of entry level or construction type jobs. If you want to work in a corporate building then Penticton is not the place for you. The Prison in Oliver, factory type, or construction jobs are good steady money. Otherwise check out Indeed or other job sites and see if anything else catches your interest. I fell into my career that way and I love it. 

Yes, petty crime sucks and it’s annoying. People are loud when their bike is stolen and nothing is done about it or if they come out and their car was broken in to.  It’s annoying, it sucks, I don’t blame them for being upset. But we also don’t see a lot of murder and when we do it wasn’t a random act of violence. 

To be honest, I don’t have cameras on my property and I live in a ‘high risk’ area for petty crime sucks to happen— but it hasn’t happened to me ... granted Yet is a key word. I have friends who live in much ‘safer’ areas of town and it has happened to them. I don’t keep anything in my car, I make sure I lock the doors. 
My old roommate had accidentally left the trunk of her car Fully open over night, and nothing was taken. 

Petty crime sucks, it’s annoying. Our mayor also kinda sucks and it’s annoying. (See castanet- he’s being charged with assault and it’s the funniest thing I’ve seen in a long time). 

As for the weather, winter is grey. When the blue sky breaks through it’s gorgeous, and when it doesn’t it can cause seasonal depression. Make sure you get vitamin D, there are lightbulbs that can help, and going up the mountain above the clouds really does help too. It’s January that sucks, and a bit of February... and then it’s Spring and Summer in the Okanagan. And what could possibly beat living in that? 

I said before, it’s a love it or leave it town.

"Yes to all your questions. Petty crime has been on the rise, and it's very evident because we're a small city. Rental availability is around 0.5%, and a 1 bd can run about $1200/mo. Looking in outlying communities is best, but gas prices make that savings negligable now. 

I grew up in Coquitlam have lived here for 16 yrs, plus 2 in the early 90's, and have been coming here since I was a baby year round (grandparents lived here), and I can't live in GVRD anymore due to medical issues. I miss the coast for some things, but not the traffic, not the busy, not the attitudes or higher prices

While there is way less to do culturally, and options for entertainment seem to be less diverse, I believe it's better here. On the whole, we spend more time outdoors, I think. Yes, we do get very grey in January, but nothing like the oppressive grey of Vancouver. Here you drive up the mountains and get above the clouds and voilà! Sun.

Jobs are plenty if you want retail, but there are also many production places hiring where a decent wage can be earned. If you're in construction, you'll always find work. If you've the right disposition the jail in Oliver can be good work - hard and off-putting, but stable work. If you don't mind a little more of a drive, Border Services in Osoyoos is also steady. 

Living here is fantastic, but the work/housing situation is kind of chicken or egg first: you need a place to live, but you also need a job to make going through the hassle of finding a place to stay worth it. Most motels will rent by the month in the off season.

"interesting history on this heritage house that burnt to the ground.

Built in 1912 by a Mr.Warren for his family. He was the president of the Kettle VALLEY Railway. That was eventually closed down  in the 1960s. My own uncle lives in Summerland and worked for Kettle Valley and then switched over fulltime to CPR ( the parent company). He retired with CP Rail. 

Anyways, the Warren House in it's latest incarnation was a bed and breakfast business....i believe a very well known and successful business. 

Fire investigators still working on site, i will guess either a guest or worker accidently started a fire, or it was caused either by an electrical glitch and /or repairs ( electrical repair, welding, plumbing, etc)",t2_kc1a9c3z,purtypurtypurtygood,0,1646764479.0,0,t1_hzvbdm6,hzvbdm6,True,DiamondRocks22,t3_t91zqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/penticton/comments/t91zqz/house_burnt_down_by_the_beach/,House burnt down by the beach,/r/penticton/comments/t91zqz/house_burnt_down_by_the_beach/hzvbdm6/,1,r/penticton,0,1
"i have a few questions too regarding wanting to move from Vancouver to Penticton or in the general area.

Are the cloudy winter days as abundant as many claim to be? if so, and you kinda detest the copious rainy days and nights in Vancouver, would not the Penticton cloudy winter days be a nice fresh change up? lol...actually serious.

\- Not gonna get into long winded details, but i have relatives living in Summerland

 Penticton for over 60 years, my own parents lived in both cities before i was born , then later on briefly for two retirement years/moved back to Vancouver. A brother lives in Penticton for 8+ years now but we do not chat much at all.

So my okanagan experiences are from just short stay summer vacations of 2-5 days and brief winter visit to see my parents back in 1993.

I always heard/been told the employment situation there  mostly sucks with few opportunities and sometimes a lower starting hourly wage then in bigger communities. 

Lastly, i read off of Castanet news frequently, the Penticton daily online news sites ( infotel penticton, etc) and even the Penticton facebook pages.....seems it is true that crime has gone up a lot for a small city of 35,000 with lots of so called petty crimes. Bike thefts, vehicle break ins/ vehicle thefts, home and business break ins, vandalism, more stranger assaults, more visible homelessness, junkies, open drug use. 

Again, i compare all this to Vancouver and my life experiences. In my city, everything i mentioned is magnified times  ten. Including the costs of living. Gas , rent, mortgages , parking fees here ( plus more) add to the stress pile and can diminish the quality of life. 

So would you say Penticton is still a better alternative than living in the lower mainland, in general with all things considered? 

To save a few bucks on overall monthly expenses, would it be a smart thing to move to the outlying communities such as Oliver and commute to work in Penticton/shop/services, etc?",t2_kc1a9c3z,purtypurtypurtygood,0,1646763225.0,0,t1_hzv7yj7,hzv7yj7,False,Averagebails,t3_t967m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/penticton/comments/t967m1/job_offer_in_penticton/,Job offer in Penticton,/r/penticton/comments/t967m1/job_offer_in_penticton/hzv7yj7/,1,r/penticton,0,1

"26F - Born and Raised in Penticton, it’s hard to find rentals— harder with dogs. They’re really trying to develop more pet/family friendly apartments where they can though. 
Get on some Facebook Rental places for Okanagan and Penticton. The commute is quick from OK Falls to Summerland areas, not terrible from Oliver - Peachland areas. 
Highway is double lane from the north but single lane from the south. 

Fun fact: Penticton is one of 2 cities in the world located between 2 lakes. And there really isn’t anything better than floating down the channel connecting the two and relaxing. Honestly, stick to Skaha Lake in the summer, less tourist and more space to enjoy the parks and beach. Definitely think about kayaks or paddleboards. There are a lot of hiking trails, mountain bike trails, a real Hockey City, and the downtown area is really stepping it’s game up — we lost all the clubs but the breweries are great places to meet people and hang out. Your Husky would probably like walking the KVR trails and enjoy the Skaha Bluffs.  

Other commenters are right, it does get Smokey from fires which really sucks. You do get used to it and often the good outweighs the bad. I recommend air purifiers indoors to help combat that. 

Winters are mild, but it’s like your bones get cold before you skin. Hard to explain until you experience it. Doesn’t snow a lot or stick around for long. But Apex mountain is 30 minutes away, Big white isn’t far to the north, or MT Baldy to the south. You have options for where you want to go— Apex is the most convenient. The mountains are always covered in Thick snow, and great for skiing/snowboarding.... side thought - with a husky maybe you should consider rentals up Apex Mountain - might make your pupper more comfortable in the summer, if you don’t mind the commute. 

Downside of living between 2 lakes: the Wind. When the temp changes we get some pretty gross wind storms sweeping through town. Haven’t lost trees in a few years (knock on wood) but it has happened. Usually just a spring issue, hasn’t been bad the last few seasons. 

Overall Penticton is where I grew up and always came back to. It’s really a love it or hate it town, but there is a reason the Okanagan is a huge tourist destination.

"I moved to Pen in 2017 for work. I left in 2018, but not because I didn’t like it, just personal circumstances. 

Pro’s: 
warm large lake to swim in, kayak etc. 

great food and hospitality 

Amazing craft beer scene 

wineries are close by 

Warm mild winters

Close-ish to Apex which has decent snow boarding, and if you are willing to drive a bit you can go to Big White, or Silver Star

Good climbing 

Good mountain biking 

People are nice (I made a few friend at work)

Good gyms 

Cons: 
Summers are Smokey (fires occur yearly and they can get close to town)

Summers are hot AF (like 30+) 

I found the hiking scene to be not great (trial heads are hard to find, and some are on private land. 

Tourist season can be a bit of a gong show (a little less bad in Pen then in Kelowna)
Wasps can get bad

Yes, it is a big reason why i've grown to detest living in Vancouver the past 10 years or so. The people are are cold and grey just like the weather, the attitudes suck. Once in awhile you bump into somebody who seems nice/upbeat and good hearted. For a brief moment, then they disappear for whatever reasons. 

Anyways, you enjoy Okanagan living and all that it has to offer!

"I guess that depends on your budget and whether or not you plan on buying or renting. 
If you plan on buying, the cost of homes has gone up in a major way around here. We bought our first home in 2020 right before everything exploded and the value of our place has gone up big time. We bought one of four units in a newly built fourplex for $419,000 and the current BC Assessment is now $480,000. I know from watching real estate like a hawk that we could EASILY get $520,000 now. As for rentals, don’t bother. It’s impossible to be a renter here. I actually manage multiple properties and I can tell you I get more applications than I can handle when a place becomes available. We have a major housing crisis here. 
All of this being said, Penticton is the only place I would want to live in this province. I’ve left and come back because you can’t beat the beauty of the place nor the convenience (everywhere is 10 mins away, max). It’s really booming right now - a lot of young people are deciding to either stay here or move back because Penticton has gotten “cooler”. We are a major hub for new breweries and of course already have the wineries. We live in the core of town and we can ride our bikes to coffee shops, restaurants and the movies in less than 5 minutes.

"ah, that is all good stuff. I do like Summerland and have many many memories as a young boy/teen and visiting for 3-4 days with my parents from Vancouver. Such friendly people, the friends and neighbors my aunt/uncle -cousins had were wayyyyyy more relaxed and normal-friendly-upbeat  then the shitheads i grew up in Vancouver! I loved walking to the five to a dollar store on Main [st.at](https://st.at) Victoria. This was in the late 1970s-80s when it was still similar to the original concept started in 1949. Anyways, when i was a kid, my cousin and i would go to that store and take the STAIRS down to the basement floor which was an entire Toy department! Man how we loved killing time down there and trying to decide what we could pool our $2-5 on and share a bunch of little toys. Across the street and up a bit the block was a tiny restaurant called the Blue Diamond and/or Johnny's Restaurant. My cousin, me and his sister would go there as young kids  and order some simple little cheap lunch combo like a ham sandwich , small bowl of soup or hamburger /fries/fish and chips.....we were kids so we were just thrilled to be eating in any restaurant with no adult supervision. 

Neat thing about Summerland back then was walking over to the little creek that runs thru the town and thru people's back yards/orchards.....sometimes we would make up a fishing pole, use hooks, string  and worms , cast  and we never ever caught any fish but it felt like living in Heaven on a warm sunny day by a cool creek with shady trees to give us a break from the hot sun rays. 

We would walk down Main street to the Pop Shoppe! buy candies and other kiddy crap. Walk nearby to this long gone '' antique store'' which was really a second hand shop and the guy sold ''old'' comic books in a cardboard box. We were always looking for older issues of Richie Rich comics, Archies, little red devil, little lotta, etc ( again, this was like 1975-81). People were always so frigging nice, even strangers/adults/seniors to us kids, never a fear of perverts or somebody bullying us, stealing stuff out of our hands or trying to harm us. 

By the way, after i read your original comment, i went and googled Summerland City Hall....found some online ''minutes'' from council going back to 2019 with chatter on how to improve and revitalize the downtown area. Seems council and residents agree that new young blood infusion is sorely needed. The council talks about improving the downtown not just to beautify but to look into adding new residential buildings , i think condos/townhomes with commercial components, maybe other community amenities such as better library or something touristy  , some festivals, some ideas to draw in younger peopleto live and work downton, spend money on goods and services/entertainment. Also better highway signage to get people to turn off the highway and visit/shop in summerland. 

Really  the goal is to entice developers to build some new housing/retail and attract younger people to live and play downtown while also having the locals want to stay in Summerland.",t2_8b5q0xu2,eatmyass_reddit,0,1644352732.0,0,t1_hw4puzz,hw4puzz,False,Underwater_things,t3_sgddi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/penticton/comments/sgddi9/thinking_of_moving_from_fraser_valley/,Thinking of moving from Fraser valley,/r/penticton/comments/sgddi9/thinking_of_moving_from_fraser_valley/hw4puzz/,2,r/penticton,0,2

Here are a couple of the projects council is looking at moving forward:

The memorial park project included an outdoor skating rink & fire bowl, pretty cool.  Nothing set in stone yet but it seems like the demographics are changing here, and with that seems to be an appetite for change and improvement.

To me, it’s the best of both worlds.  I get to live in the “country”, close to hiking and peaceful wilderness + vineyards, but there are all the amenities I need here in town.  If I need a Walmart, it’s 15 minutes away…. But I don’t have to live next to it.

"I’m going to second the person who mentioned Summerland. 

Moved from the lower mainland 2 years ago.  I kept my remote job, my partner rehired here.  We originally looked at penticton.  So glad we settled in Summerland.

Best I can match, Penticton is like Poco at the moment.  Some crime/homelessness, but not even remotely on a par with DTES.  It’s there, be cognizant, but it’s basically as visible as poco
- BUT, crime is not on the Bench or Sendero etc. it’s in town. So see my comment below re: investigating neighborhoods and evaluating them on their own merits 
- big box convenience is there - Walmart and superstore, but from Summerland it is a 15 min rip down the highway. It took 15 minutes to find parking sometimes at Coquitlam centre! So lack of big stores directly in Summerland is no prob
- city of Summerland has some big plans for revitalization, if you’re looking as an investment for LT growth might be good investment 

Basically, I learned there are lots of different neighbourhoods even within one town, so visit lots of airbnbs before you buy, go for lots of walks and drives… and don’t write the whole town off based on a few blocks. Go everywhere, stay everywhere.  If you fall in love with a property in Peachland, don’t write it off because it’s Peachland and you wanted penticton or Kelowna. With traffic patterns here it might not be a dealbreaker like it would be in the LM.

"There will be some give and takes ...but it might just balance out and you and your wife end up doing very well in Penticton. 

Homes are cheaper to purchase , as the home insurance. 

\- Vehicle insurance is cheaper then in the lower manland. Same with the price of gas. 

\- your quality of life should improve for a variety of reasons: short and relaxing work commutes. Line ups at the bank, restaurants, sporting events, ice rinks, movie theaters, bars, parking lots, lol, the beach, the one friggin Mall ETC will be a piece of cake compared to the throngs of angry assholes in metro vancouver . 

\-  beautiful okanagan scenery, beautiful views, fresher air, long dry summers, easy access to lakes, parks, camping, hiking. The late Fall/winter months can have some snowy cold nights, sometimes the locals whine about a ''cloud inversion''...lol....overall, better Fall/Winter and you do get sunny days sprinkled thru out. Then early Spring with sunny sorta warm March, warm April and i dunno, 6-7 months of sunshine. Unless you really like being rained on in the fraser valley/metro vancouver for 9 months or so. 

\- Back to quality of life: Penticton has some petty crime issues, few violent crimes ..but overall, for a small city of 35,000, way less assholes per square kilometer then the lower mainland. Far less road raging jerks or two faced employers/employees to deal with ,Friendlier, upbeat people, more positive minded, more community. 

if you beging to miss the lower mainland douche baggery attitudes or crave more restaurants, stores, malls, traffic woes, road ragings..heck, go drive to kelowna. Then drive back to penticton and be content you did not move to kelowna. 

So i think the biggest obstacle is the employment. Or lack of it. You may take a pay cut. You may have to take a job in your trade and grin and bare it as maybe not so easy to get fed up, quit and quickly get another job. 

\- But that is where we come back to balance. Little less pay, less variety in shops and restaurants, doctors, less fun events...but fuck me...you can buy a nice home with a big lot, afford your mortgage payments/home insurance, you can afford a full tank of gas , afford your monthly icbc car insurance......and you might feel Happier because you live in a pleasant  place with scenery, sunshine and nicer humans.",t2_8b5q0xu2,eatmyass_reddit,0,1643597647.0,0,t1_huxztc4,huxztc4,True,Underwater_things,t3_sgddi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/penticton/comments/sgddi9/thinking_of_moving_from_fraser_valley/,Thinking of moving from Fraser valley,/r/penticton/comments/sgddi9/thinking_of_moving_from_fraser_valley/huxztc4/,3,r/penticton,0,3

"You can tell pretty easily imo. There are hot spots the crime / homeless / drug addicts tend to stay within such as certain motels. Much much worse and visible in warmer months. Crime is mostly petty theft, bike theft and vandalism from what I’ve read in the paper and notice first hand. This was the worst of the crime I could find since buying a house here in November 2020. (Side note: we were lucky to buy when we did because we just received our housing assessment and it’s up 66%.)

However,  there have been a handful of murders still under investigation over the past year and a half to two years. 3 of them in relation to each other through gang activity. So it’s kind of hard to tell if Penticton is on the uprising to more frequent serious crime or if it was just an unfortunate rough patch. (I pre-apologize if that statement sounds unsympathetic.)

"This is likely correct. Disputes on assessments cannot be made on either the land or building value, only on the total combined value. We bought our house last year and the new total assessment value reflects the price we paid. They put the extra value mostly into the building column (which more than tripled). Neighbors land value went up by roughly same proportion ours did but their building values were pretty stable. I guess it was the way to get our value up without increasing their too? I dunno why but, to the original point, only total values matter for appeals. If your neighbours went up less than yours and you didn’t buy in 2021 then you might still have grounds for appeal though.

"Relevant issues regarding your 2022 property assessment in BC, and opportunities for challenging it:  1. Is your property classified properly (tax rates differ widely depending on property classification)?  2. Is your property's total market value within a reasonable (say 5-10%) range of market value as of July 1, 2021?  3. Is your property assessed equitably in comparison to other, relatively similar properties in your assessment jurisdiction?  If your response to the three questions is no, and you can concisely prove it by referencing comparable market data and relative comparability to your property, you may be able to successfully challenge your total assessed value at a Property Assessment Review Panel hearing.  

Irrelevant issues: Prior year assessments of your property and / or other comparable properties.  This is not a valid line of challenge, as each year the assessments are reset with a new effective reference date (always July 1 of the prior year).  So prior year assessed values are moot.

By the way, proving inequity to an Assessment Review Panel is very difficult, without assistance from a valuation expert.  Assessment Review Panel consideration is a reasonable tool available to BC property owners for airing concerns and seeking explanations or valuation adjustment, but it all requires specific evidence of market value (no hearsay; no opinions; just market evidence).

Before starting an appeal you can ask BCAA for some comparable sales. The question on an appeal will be whether your assessed value is correct as of July 1 of last year. The percentage of the increase is not an issue on the appeal. It could be that your property was under-assessed in the previous year.,t2_ayz9upc6,againfaxme,0,1641627805.0,0,t1_hrr49y2,hrr49y2,True,nihiriju,t3_ryrrm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/penticton/comments/ryrrm5/property_tax_assesment/,Property Tax Assesment,/r/penticton/comments/ryrrm5/property_tax_assesment/hrr49y2/,2,r/penticton,0,2
"Thanks, yeah the assessed value is close to likely sales price now, might be beyond, but I've asked our neighbours and theirs went up 30% vs, our 60%. I've done a lot of gardening and painted our house 4 years ago, but previously it was listed as a teardown and the house as $40k, now the house is suddenly worth $350 k to the assesment.

"A property assessment increase of 60% doesn't automatically mean a 60% increase in your municipal tax.  The municipality has their annual budget and that is a set number.  Each property pays a portion of that amount.  The portion is related to your property assessment, but is also relative to all of the other property assessments in your municipality.

However, if your assessment really did go up by 60%, then you are likely to see a municipal tax increase, as your assessment went up much more than the average.  I believe the average was something more like 30%.

the thing I'd be doing in your case is to check your neighbourhood and other things to try to figure out why yours went up so much.  If after looking you feel like your property went up more than it should have, you can appeal to BC Assessment to have it corrected.

I did that many years ago and was successful.

Edit...

And I forgot to mention.  Ours went up by 39% this year.  But when I compared that to our neighbours they all had nearly identical increases.

Dancing on the beaches at night with hundreds of people. Downtown Penticton looked almost like Las Vegas. You'd see hundreds of people walking Main street partying and mingling (summers that is).  I moved up here in the late 90s thinking it was still the same. It kinda was a little back in 1998, but not quite as much. However, once smoking was banned from indoor places, I knew that bars would start shutting down one by one since it was mainly smokers that loved partying so much. Booze and smokes went hand in hand.

"I hear this a lot-- aggressive drivers in Penticton-- and while I do see it getting worse lately, I also don't see it as something that makes it harder to get around.  The only people I see get truly screwed by speeding traffic here are the people in Riva Ridge.  I've turned left out of Canadian Tire enough times myself to know you just have to be patient and actually accelerate to the speed of traffic once you finally turn.  Is it really that hard to gage when someone's going 70 as opposed to 50 when most people are going 70?  Either way, feeling like people should slow down isn't a reason to pull out from the stop sign and force them to slow down.

Sorry; I'm not meaning to come at you or say anything about you, personally.  This is definitely one of my pet peeves, though.  Railway is part of our highway.  The fastest speed limit on the route through town is only 70.  If anything, what Penticton needs is a lightless bypass where highway speeds are possible.  A lot of traffic is just trying to use highway 97 and won't be stopping in Penticton at all.  A lot of the people who speed through town are trying to cut time and make lights.  I don't condone that; I just think it's inevitable and something that we all have to adjust for as population increases because of the way our roads are built.  With a bypass, people could go places like Canadian Tire and reasonably expect drivers on the road to be driving like they're in town, on city streets, and not on a highway.  As it is, I always expect drivers to be going 70 on Railway.  I can tell someone's actually going 50 when 5 cars are attached to their bumper.

It's really too bad there's seemingly nowhere to build a bypass.  As more and more people move up from the coast, more and more people are going to drive like they're from the coast; and we're going to need it even more.  We don't have the police to enforce traffic hard enough to keep up with the influx.  And a lot of these aggressive drivers were already around-- multiple people going 120 on the 80 sections of my commute into town for years and years-- they're just standing out now because it's getting more crowded on the roads.  Someone who would've just blown by me before is now weaving around a few more cars before flying away.  Attempting to slow drivers like that down is not, unfortunately, a safe nor realistic solution.

I may or may not have huge feelings about traffic flow in this valley.

"No, it's not really. Plenty of regions have vaccine mandates for public schools (with real medical exceptions), including in canada.

""Vaccine Passports"" in a sense are not new, they are just increasing in scope due to the fact that we are in a god damn pandemic.

Edit: Tbh, I'm ok with the alternative, concerts for all and lets burn this shit out.

other than that, kaziganthi covered all the basics. Meeples and Milkshakes is amazing, have never had less than an amazing experience there. also if you're looking for some fun, LocoLanding is a nice amusement park to go to! they also have mini golf if youre not into the high-excitement sorta stuff :) and to add on one more thing, there should be an Exit Escape Room coming to Penticton later this year!! definitely recommend researching that if you ever come in the future.

the central Okanagan is currently a Covid hotspot, and is just north of us. travel through, From and into this region risks spreading Covid at a faster rate.

that being said, if you're already here, or can't be dissuaded, or are simply a local or new transplant looking for flavour, here's some:

karaoke at the barley mill every Wed, Friday and Saturday. Trivia at Slackwater on Tuesdays, Live music on Saturdays.

Meeples and Milkshakes for a board game cafe, the badlands or the cannery Backyard for great patio experiences. Jeffer's Fries is a Penticton classic.  Ogo's icecream for a cone, the book shop on main is a great place to lose some time, or Sirius science and nature

"Make sure to check with the city or RDOS. There are a lot of weird rules around fruit trees in the valley to protect the fruit industry trees. Some HAVE TO get sprayed, others aren't allowed at all. Another thing to consider if you live in interface area is fruit trees bring LOTS of wild animals to the yard (way more than anyone's milkshakes). The upkeep is lots of work. Have to pick up the fruit immediately. You'll have deer, bears, maybe cougars (but cats are usually after pets), birds. Then there's the bugs. So many bugs. Do deep dives into the care needed for these trees. Water included, growth time, fruit, sprays, critters, pruning,... My neighbours moved from Calgary and wanted to replace our shared tree (we're a duplex) with a fruit tree. We live close to Okanagan Beach, and have deer roaming around all the time, and I wasn't about to deal with the work, the poop from deer, the ticks dropping off them, etc. Everyone I know that has a fruit tree has a love hate with them: they love the fruit (when they've had a successful crop that bugs/birds haven't gotten to), but they struggle to keep up with all the fruit.

"That's a great question.  Would be nice to hear from someone who can actually provide the guidance.  I've got a Turbo Levo, which is pedal assist - no throttle - I stop pedaling and I fall over. That's a Class 1 ebike, and its speed is limited to 32 km/h.  I am passed occasionally by the throttle assist ebikes, and am concerned about their trail etiquette. They are classified as Class 2 (or 3, hard to say because I wouldn't know their top speed).  Now then, the KVR can be used by motorized traffic, i.e.: quads, motox bikes, cars, pickups, etc, but only sections that have been designated as such.  Those sections are identified because they have no bollards at the entrance which would limit their access (that's my thought, in any case).  When you're further out of Penticton, past Naramata, on the way up to Chute Lake, it's very common to share the KVR with hunters or other outdoors people on quads, in their pickups, etc. Past Chute Lake towards the Myra Canyon area, you'll see lots of motorized vehicles, some very large.  My wife and I have cycled extensively on the KVR between Penticton and Myra Canyon area, and the only other traffic that concerns me (with their lack of etiquette) are those throttle assist ebikes. That link you provided is fairly full of information.

Yeah it's this.  I wouldn't be able to go to a place like that on vacation and relax and have a good time while the locals are having what could possibly be the worst time of their lives thus far.  I don't really know what to say to people who can't relate to that.  And yet everything you say about being reliant on tourism is also correct-- I recognize that going through another summer without many tourists wouldn't be great for local business, either.

"Yes exactly tbh I find it to be a bit troubling that tourists are wanting to vacation in a place with more than a few natural hazards occurring. Would you go to a place that was recently devastated by a tsunami? An earthquake? Probably not. Obviously a wild fire in a vast forest may seem distant to some because of our varying locations, but it still falls under the same category as dangerous natural hazards that people can die from as they’re extremely difficult to control and can be wildly unpredictable as well. There is some cognitive dissonance happening here, I believe. I mean heck, I just read an article where people have been REFUSING to leave their homes and firefighters have to waste their time and precious fire fighting resources, risking their lives, going door to door to force recalcitrant people out of where they’ve already been alerted to evacuate. It’s unbelievable. 

But at the same time I understand that the town heavily depends on tourists’ incomes to build up some profitable revenue for the wealth of the city. So it’s challenging for me to make up my mind on tourists coming this summer. If fires continue to get worse and worse, I reckon the city is gonna have to become more self-sustaining through other business promoting programs (idk I’m not an economist) and perhaps export some of their other products. I know there’s ship to sip for wineries and BC fruit trees already, but I think Penticton should add something to their economy “portfolio”/“menu”. Idk I could be reaching. I’m just trying to think long term if next year is gonna be this bad as well, as climate change is actively wreaking havoc throughout the world. Like this is not the only place that has been suffering. If it continues to be this way and tourists continue to stay away for their own health and safety, we need to come up with something else to take care of ourselves. We’ve fallen in a staple trap and have grown dependent on the presence of tourists to live.",t2_55ndmztf,throwaway--myfault,0,1626970285.0,0,t1_h653epj,h653epj,False,sirroningsd,t3_op28sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/penticton/comments/op28sv/fire_update_from_locals/,Fire update from locals???,/r/penticton/comments/op28sv/fire_update_from_locals/h653epj/,3,r/penticton,0,3

"Sounds like you found your slice of paradise ! Good for you and your family. 

I've been doing a lot of online Okanagan researching the past 3 years or so and i keep discovering a lot of new to me places i can add to my bucketlist to check out when i too make my move to Penticton. There are quite a few new restaurant/cafes/pizzerias opening up or about to open , mostly from former Vancouverites, Calgarians and even from Toronto. 

And if you like to explore a little bit, even Oliver i read has gotten more interesting with new bakeries, eateries, new winery/beer -retail development being built and some new stores to check out. Plus go check out the old movie theater in Oliver. [https://olivertheatre.ca/](https://olivertheatre.ca/)

Apparently there is a very good chinese restaurant in Peachland to go check out that many rave about. I think it's Dragon Lotus. And back in Penticton, there are 2-3 Indian restaurants the locals seem to really like. Also another Indian restaurant in Oliver supposedly good. ( Keep in mind, often the locals of small towns will rave about how good food is at an ethnic eatery when they have nothing to compare it to or have never really eaten at truly good and authentic ethnic restaurants. But a lot of Inidian, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese and other immigrants are moving away from the traditional big cities and setting up shop in smaller towns and cities, so who knows? lol...) 

\- Oh, if you recall going to Field's dept store, there is one in Princeton. Sometimes there are little bakeries or diners there that are nice to go check out and have a decent meal without any big city drama or attitudes.

"The fire is nowhere near downtown Penticton; but I don't know that I'd consider Skaha close to downtown Penticton either.  The fire/smoke are highly visible from Skaha Lake itself, as well as along the highway toward OK Falls.  The smoke varies wildly-- some mornings my eyes are burning in my own house; one afternoon was nighttime dark at like 4pm; other mornings we have blue sky.  It doesn't small great and seems to get worse in the afternoons.  I wouldn't want to be out in it for hours.

I have mixed feelings about people coming to vacation here right now if they don't know anyone local to stay with.  There are lots of people on evacuation alert who will need places to go if anything changes-- and that's without considering the possibility of new fires in the area.  Our one highway is already packed and that could make things extremely dangerous for people in places like Osoyoos, should they need to flee quickly.  1000 tourists were evacuated from that area already and have been asked to go home because we have nowhere to put them.

Just make sure your family checks with their accommodations before leaving that everything is still a go.  It isn't a normal summer for the south end of the valley.

"We’re right behind Skaha bluffs actually, gorgeous when you can see them. Apparently winds are supposed to pick up this week. As I’m typing rn it’s pretty windy and clear skies. Yesterday the AQI was moderate to high (5 on the scale). They are currently blowing north which does not bode well but directions can change on a dime, which also depends on the atmospheric pressure (more inclined to blow the direction with a low pressure system as opposed to high pressure). The Oliver fire is 2,556ha as of right now and is imaginably very difficult to control despite our people’s best efforts. Much of the area has been ordered to evacuate or is on high alert. Over 200 estates have had to evacuate, not necessarily including the wineries that have also had to close and evacuate their guests (Burrowing Owls was one of them). Black sage road (where some wineries in Oliver are) apparently just closed, although was open just this morning. The Oliver mayor (Kate Mctyroff or some other) straight up just said not to visit and the area in general is restricted from tourists as Osoyoos refugees may need to evacuate to there as tourists may already be occupying much needed accommodations at the existing hotels/motels, which is unfair as residents should ideally be holding priority but we all know these places run on first come first serve basis. 

If your parents are coming for wine they may miss out. Two or three nights ago the skies were this hazy browny orange which was terrible. It rained ash that night as well as last night in Penticton. As soon as I stepped out of the house yesterday I could smell the ash in the air and my eyes were feeling dry. 

Enough with the facts. Personally I’ve been very alarmed and stressed. I’m hoping that our home won’t be affected by the fire and be given an order of evacuation. The stress has been building up the past week. Personally if I were you guys, I would not want to vacation at a place that people are literally fleeing from with whatever they can carry. It seems a little in poor taste to be doing that, which is why unaffected wineries are also closing, not just in fear of their staff and guests becoming injured, but because they are adhering to the BC alerts. 

And now as this message is closing, the wind blew south a little bit and is currently standstill. Just as an example of how fast winds can change and it took me approximately 5-10 minutes to type this out.

Eta: yep the winds are back. another stat i just remembered - this fire season (starting from April 1) has burned 200,000 more hectares than the previous 10 year average of 100,000ha, meaning we’ve already burnt over 300,000ha. There has already been over 1,000 fires and over 200 active ones. Dk if you care for numbers but these are the facts that I came across online. I recommend you download the BC Wildfire Services app if you haven’t already.

"It’s not a foolish trip!  Penticton is an awesome place to visit with lots to do; it seems the fires are going to be a regular summer event and you shouldn’t stop living your life and enjoying your summer because of them. 

You can check the wildfires around Penticton on the BC Wildfire App; it’s no where near DT Penticton and is not threatening this city at all.

Air quality is precarious depending on the winds etc.. this like will help you see the air quality for yourself.

"In BC only about 5% of land is considered arable. It’s 16% in Alberta. 

Like 30% of all agricultural products in Canada are produced in Alberta. The size of the industry is about 60 times bigger. 

I actually have two degrees a BSc. In Agriculture with a minor in chemistry from an agricultural school in Oklahoma. And I have a degree in economics (specialization resource economics) from Concordia in Montreal. I’m also fluently bilingual. 

And unless I’m willing to live in the lower mainland, (which I’m not) there isn’t much in BC. Also you have to factor in the cost of living. 

There was a job I saw in Kelowna…but it paid less than an identical job just outside of Edmonton.

I do not live in Penticton but visit a variety of Penticton web pages ( mostly News, web cams, weather, crime ) every day/ night and have family living there and other okanagan communities. 

Looks like another scorcher with 37-39C high temps , then a ''cool down'' at around 34-35C. 

Keep in mind that Penticton was on high fire risk evacuation alert in 2019 , maybe not the entire city, but the areas closer to the hills and including sections of the city proper. Currently in a very high risk fire Danger of 4 to 5 rating. 

Keep all this in mind. Are you prepared to pack up your shit and flee if ordered to evacuate? If your motel , air 'n B, house rental/ relative-friend's home you stay at is part of the evacuation zone and you are told to go stay at a YMCA or emergency shelter? Anybody have asthma? elderly? anybody in a wheelchair or has mobility issues? Just something to think about. You may visit and the air may or may not be only smoky at times and otherwise a fantastic trip....or maybe not.

>Last week, Lytton, a small town in British Columbia, Canada, broke its nation’s all-time temperature reading three days in a row as temperatures soared as high as 121 degrees. Days later, the village largely burned to the ground as extreme wildfires spewed smoke and ash 55,000 feet into the sky.

>
>Now, southwest Canada and much of the western United States are bracing for another bout of exceptional heat amid a pattern that could once again place records in jeopardy. Death Valley, Calif., might spike to 130 degrees.
>
>Temperatures up to 25 degrees above average could dominate most of the West this weekend into next week, with little relief in sight for quite some time. Odds favor anomalously hot and dry conditions to prevail into the fall.
>
>On Tuesday, weather models were hinting that a building ridge of high pressure over the West, colloquially known as a summertime “heat dome,” would become established over the Four Corners region later in the week. By Saturday, it will be reinforced by a secondary such system passing through west central Canada, the two systems’ synergy resulting in widespread unusual to record temperatures.
>
Excessive heat watches blanket much of southeast California in the Mojave Desert, as well as southern Nevada and adjacent northwest Arizona. Heat advisories and excessive heat warnings extend through the Great Basin northward into interior northern California, western Utah, southeast Oregon and southern Idaho.
>
>“This warning is reserved for only the hottest days of the year and is issued when temperatures are expected to rise to dangerous levels,” wrote the National Weather Service office in Flagstaff, Ariz. Between Wednesday and Saturday, high temperatures below 4,000 feet elevation in northwest Arizona, particularly in the canyons, could range between 110 and 117 degrees.
>
>Death Valley will flirt with record temperatures, expected to climb into the upper 120s to near 130 degrees. It is possible that temperatures will not drop the century mark from Wednesday morning to the middle of next week, with overnight lows around or above 100 degrees. On Sunday, the afternoon high could nick 130, which would match the highest temperature recorded there or anywhere on the planet in decades.
>
The heat will not just fester in the desert — it will scorch populous areas already gripped by extreme to exceptional drought. More than 25 million Americans will endure triple-digit heat over the coming week, many of whom reside in California’s Central Valley.
>
>Highs in much of the San Joaquin Valley will top 95 degrees on Wednesday and Thursday. Highs between 100 and 105 are likely Friday before the heat ramps up markedly toward the weekend. By Saturday, most of the Golden State’s interior valleys will be looking at highs approaching 110 degrees.
>
>Redding, Calif., could see highs of 110 degrees or greater from Friday into at least next week; overnight lows, meanwhile, will offer next to no respite from the brutal temperatures.
>
>“Little to no overnight relief is expected as lows may only cool into the upper 60s to low 80s,” wrote the Weather Service office in Sacramento. Sacramento itself will likely hit 104 degrees for the high both Saturday and Sunday.
>
>Needles, Calif., along Interstate 40 at the Arizona border, will crest above 115 degrees every day in the coming week, with highs around 120 degrees expected Saturday.
>
>“Heat like this happens rarely,” wrote the Weather Service in Hanford, Calif. “Very high heat risk to everyone.”
>
>The heat will extend all the way into Canada on Saturday, with highs around 100 bleeding into British Columbia. Medford, Ore., will see a high of 103 degrees; Boise, Idaho, could jump to 102, and Las Vegas will sizzle at 115 degrees. Areas closer to the coast, such as Seattle and Portland, will remain in the 80s.
>
>Extended weather models suggest that high pressure will remain in control and bring significant warmth over the next two weeks. As it stands, the intensity of the heat wave this weekend is predicted to be comparable to what once may have been a once in five-year or once in 10-year event for some areas. The magnitude and frequency of heat extremes, like the unprecedented outbreak of high temperatures blamed for hundreds of excess deaths in Canada and the Pacific Northwest last week, is increasingly due to human-induced climate change.

"Welcome! I'm a local, and can tell you there is a less than 1% rental availability here. During the summer months, no motels do long term rentals, and are heavily booked until late Aug, early Sept. It'd be a miracle to find a room via that route. There are two families that you should try desperately not to rent from: the Singlas' (brothers or Vijay), and the Singh's (Raj). Very few of their properties are maintained well, or at all (in Raj Singh's case). I was a property manager for a long time, and the stories I've hear from former renters are consistent in their experiences were awful and conditions were abysmal. Both families have been in and out of court for decades over violations, and constantly being sued, or fought with in BC Residential Arbitration. Rents are too damned high around here too. Looking in OK Falls, Kaleden, Trout Creek, or Summerland should be on your list (all withing a 15-20 mins drive from Penticton). Definitely check with all the real estate places, they'll have better leads. As stated, there are rental scams here. NEVER send money or rent sight unseen, and ALWAYS sign a rental agreement. 

Also important to know: finding a doctor is a province wide problem. You'll have to rely on walk in clinics until a spot opens up. Ask the hospital for the list of drs accepting patients, but expect to wait years before actually getting one.

Fb forums are more ''real time'' with the responses. Reddit Penticton is just way too quiet and you may not get many replies on here.

I can suggest a bunch of online Penticton websites that have subsections full of news, business, weather, traffic, webcams  and much more.

\-I'm also looking forward to moving away from Vancouver and into Penticton the next few years to come. I will also need to rent  either a small house ( depending on who coming with me. If just me, renting an apartment. Long term plan is to rent, get a job, buy a 3-4 bdrm home, retire! ). 

Once again, use caution when searching for rentals. Do not feel pressured or rushed. Ask questions, ask around, document stuff you do and people you talk with. Be wise with your money/credit cards and cheques, be wise with what info you give out to internet strangers or in person. Other then that, Penticton is a very nice family oriented small city with fantastic weather. If you can afford to buy a house, buy it. Too desirable and prices keep shooting up, too many investors buying up houses and condos looking to flip for fast profit. Average home price is apparently at $625,000. Last year or so it was closer to $550-$575K. My brother bought his 1200 sq ft condo for only $147,000 in 2015. Similar in his condo building selling currently from $300,000 to $325,000. His strata monthly fee was a decent $140......he now pays $355 per month!",t2_bm820acs,Happy-Wet-Fart,0,1625605374.0,0,t1_h4a4rx8,h4a4rx8,False,sukkotfretensis,t3_oezjpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/penticton/comments/oezjpk/aussieczech_couple_moving_to_penticton/,Aussie/Czech couple moving to Penticton!,/r/penticton/comments/oezjpk/aussieczech_couple_moving_to_penticton/h4a4rx8/,5,r/penticton,0,5

Castanet.net will also have some rentals. I think your best bet would be to find something short term and then you will be able to explore the city and see where you do and don’t want to live. This also allows you to meet potential landlords on site and view the house before renting. There are some not so nice places that can look half decent if you take the right photos.

"Use a real estate agent/rental agency and pay the fee. 

There are  rental scammers active in Penticton. Double check credentials, ask for ID, ask to take photos of rental units and get the renter in the photos. If you have to be sneaky about it, so be it. 

If you rent from private sources ( no rental agency or RE agent ) take photos of their  vehicles, license plates, etc....anything that helps you identify a scammer to the RCMP . I would also knock on doors of neighbors and politely say hello/mention you are thinking of renting the apartment/house next door and wondering if this is a good area to rent.

I don’t subscribe to the Herald but apparently there was a recent edition where there was a line saying there will be a “figurative wall” between him and the news coverage, and then right underneath - on the same page of the paper! - was a paid advertisement for his candidacy for council!

As with so many things these days, bringing up ethics concerns seems to be just tilting at windmills.

"I’m not surprised at all. I’ve been involved in conflict of interest discussions before in my own industry, and when I called one out a few years ago (not the same exact situation, but one where a person has a vote on a group to which he’s accountable), the response was “it’s fine. This is a very common thing”. I actually know that that’s a common thing (think a CEO being a voting member or even chair of the Board of the company), but it’s a bit unnerving to me that we act as if something being common makes it morally right.

I don’t begrudge him running - if he wanted to run, fine, but he should have given up his job with the paper. This thing even made a national politics podcast recently, and I agree with the commentator who said, “you can’t do both these things”. Other journalists are openly mocking this situation.

"My problem is not at all about where he is on the political spectrum. I lean more conservative myself but that’s irrelevant here. Would you be as upset about the conflict if he were “progressive”? Honest question - not trying to troll at all.

But your reply illustrates the larger issue, in my mind. I agree that he has more name recognition, and that seems to be the primary focus of voters. The specific policies and/or records of people in how they’ve served their communities take a distant second to “do I recognize this person’s name?”.

Honestly; this city is full of senior citizens that come out to vote.  They are also old school newspaper subscribers so they know his name and all of his points of view; many of them significantly conservative.   There is little doubt they know his name and recognize him as a celebrity and knowledgable critic.  It is unfortunate because he is not progressive and we will no doubt be no further ahead with small Manufacturing or any kind of  business development; the job makers.

"We have had a very positive experience with Penticton Crossfit (CFP). When we were newbies a couple of years ago, Ross and Jodi (the owners) were super welcoming and we never felt out of place. Their intro classes were so helpful for getting up to speed and we love the community that we joined. Lots of fit people but also just lots of “regular” people trying to stay fit :) Coaching was always excellent, focussing on form & proper mechanics over heavy weights and “killing workouts.” There was another coach there that we didn’t love as much but he has since left to start his own Gym. They’ve also handled Covid very well (IMO). 

We never tried out Beach City because we lived on the CFP side of town and it was more convenient, so I can’t comment on that. All in all, I would 10/10

"Something to keep in mind IF socializing with other Asians ( chinese, japanese, korean, vietnamese, etc) is very important to you....you may feel lonely/isolated and eventually dislike Penticton. 

Even much bigger Kelowna has a tiny tiny Asian population. So you may miss greatly simple things that brought you great comfort that you find in a Vancouver ( or in very limited amounts)-

\-thai chi groups in the park

A chinatown. or Koreatown, Filipino district or Vietnamese district such as Kingsway in East Vancouver. 

Authentic , tasty and cheap Asian food, either at restaurants or Asian markets. 

No Richmond style night [market. No](https://market.No) real nightlife 

If you feel only comfortable visiting only Asian doctors/dentists and conversing in your own language, highly doubtful you find an Asian doctor. There are other scenarios i could mention, but you get the idea. 

I have lived in Vancouver my entire life. Living next door to chinese and vietnamese, having Asian friends from many countries. My sister inlaw is from Hong Kong. 

I will tell you, having chatted with these Asian friends & neighbors, Sis inlaw,  over the years and the subject of wanting to move to Penticton comes up they will tell me that it is a beautiful place to go visit for a weekend, but because it lacks many of the things i mention, they cannot see themselves living in Penticton . or Kelowna/Vernon. 

Different for the Asians that are first born Canadian generation, but even still, it can be just too white canadian outside of metro Vancouver.

"Penticton and area are a bicyclist's paradise, and becoming moreso.  Even if you don't have a license, buy a bicycle.  And since e-bikes are becoming more popular, just get one of those.  For the local trips, a bicycle will take you almost everywhere you need to go.  For anything out of town, bus service is quite infrequent, but is available.  Taxi service seems to be adequate here, but I have no experience with that, other than seeing many taxis on the road. There isn't a large asian population here in the Okanagan, so that may affect decision to move here.  I'm white European descent, so I'm not the person to speak to about racism, but my opinion would be that people aren't going to be much different here than in the other parts of BC that you've been.  Narrow-minded people live everywhere, and sometimes meeting and talking to someone from another country, or of another culture will be enough for them to change their views.  If you're involved in some physical activity here, I don't think you'd experience any racism at all.  Good luck on finding a home to purchase, and I think you'll enjoy it here.

"Penticton is awesome. We don't really care where you were born. Not sure what part of Asia you're from, but Penticton has a sister city in Japan; Ikeda, in Hokkaido. Penticton Secondary also has a robust exchange student program with kids from many different countries. Work wise, oodles of retail/service jobs, but higher paid jobs would be career dependant. Weather is much dryer than Vancouver. Outdoor sports for all seasons here. People are friendly, IMO, but there's always a jerk somewhere. Finding a Dr is a years long battle, you'll rely on a walk in clinic. Shopping is pretty limited.

"> I am thinking of buying the affordable house and settle down there. But I haven't been to a small town before and don't drive so my question is Will there be a problem if I move there without a car?

No problem not owning a car at all depending on your location and needs. Your definition of ""affordable"" is unique to you though. If you can afford Vancouver, Penticton should be fine.

> Is there public transit?

Yes, but unlike Vancouver you might have to plan your trip. Considering where you live and the routes, the trip to a bus stop is something you want to discuss with your realtor. A good place to find info on public transit is online, all routes and up to date times are going to be posted.

> Will I experience some form of discrimination since I wasn't born in Canada? I have been in Alberta before and sometimes people just walked away as soon as they found out I wasn't born here.

Absolutely you will. Sorry to put it so bluntly. Racist assholes are everywhere, even in Penticton.

"You can definitely get by without a car in Penticton as you can bike or walk to most places within a reasonable time. However it will be difficult to really get the full experience of living there.   I would expect that you would eventually want to be able to drive and have your own vehicle.

I don't know about how you would experience any racism, it is definitely more white in nature, but my understanding is that a lot more people are moving there from other regions and it is making it somewhat more diverse with respect to race and sexual orientation.

"Honestly it isn't the most affordable place when it comes to other things than real estate. I'd like to say there isn't discrimination but there is largely toward indigenous people, not sure how it is for all races. Disclaimer I am a white male.

Not having a car shouldn't be a problem, the furthest anything really is for me atleast is 60 minute walk but there are lots of busses, from what I know we have a decent public transit system. 

I'm 19 this has been my experience, of course it can be different for others. I'm just being as honest as I can.

Tons of minimum wage jobs here, people like to complain they can't get one but you can.

It really is a beutiful town though, lots of views and beutiful landscape.
