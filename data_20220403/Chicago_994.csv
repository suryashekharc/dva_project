">I kinda just want west loop’s restaurants in Streeterville.

Good God that would be heaven. I mean, we do have an underrated (as far as r/chicago is concerned) restaurant scene.

The stretch on Ontario and Ohio with places like Gyu Kaku, MingHin, Ron of Japan, Dao, Coco Pazzo, Indian Garden, Woodwind, l'Aventino and more. There's Shang Noodle, D4, O'Tooles, Yolk, Volare, Robert's Pizza, Pinched, Pinstripes, etc. And apparently the border is East of Rush, so that technically gives us places like Le Colonial and whatever else is up that way.

It just seems like with our population that we should have something similar to West Loop, but oh well. My only problem with it here is the lack of groceries. The only real option is Whole Foods unless you want rotting veggies from Bockwinckels. It's not like our Target has much, being so tiny and all.

Out of those 3 (which are all listed here) Streeterville is definitely the most meh. The South Loop has printers row, prairie ave and all of the interesting buildings on Michigan. Streeterville has glass condos/apartments, a hospital and not much else.

"So you've hit the nail on the head.

A few years back, WBEZ did a story on property tax and discussed ***original intent and purpose of property tax***.  And this is gonna blow your mind.

Property tax pre-dates income tax.  The property tax was envisioned as a tax upon one's ***potential to use property to generate income***, not actual income.  Back then, landowners mostly weren't simple homeowners.  They were either farmers, landlords to people, or engaged in some other commercial activity.  So the idea of the tax was really ***You are being taxed this much, you better use your land to generate that much to pay the tax or you will lose the land.***

I think the solution is to change the rules so assessors stick them with a fair tax bill and either the owners will sell a property that is losing money, fix the units to attract clients, or reduce the rents and maybe neighborhoods could get some small independent businesses move in.",t2_qheca,NeroBoBero,0,1648998856.0,0,t1_i38c31n,i38c31n,False,monkeyboats,t3_tva97z,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/tva97z/whats_chicagos_most_mediocre_neighborhood/,What’s Chicago’s most MEDIOCRE neighborhood?,/r/chicago/comments/tva97z/whats_chicagos_most_mediocre_neighborhood/i38c31n/,55,r/chicago,0,55

"Oh, people are attracted to it, we have a problem with lack of retail activity (empty retail).

***I think the problem is the proximity to the loop is making landlords so greedy they don't actually rent retail space out.***

Going back to the 13-year retail vacancy in my building, I called the broker representing the property's potential rent.  They said the rent is $30/sq foot per year, and at 3,000 square feet that's $90,000 for annual rent.

Now who's the customer for that?  It's raw space, so not only is rent nearly six figures, it will require a 6-figure build-out.  So that makes it really hard for a startup to get in there.  So that leaves big corporations.  What big corporations want to invest nearly $2 million to start a shop on a residential street.

The broker told me that it was standard loop retail rent ... but this isn't the loop and it's not going to generate loop-level traffic.  Being 200 feet from the loop is not being in the loop, and you can't charge retail rent like it is.

You know the Roosevelt Collection?  

The retail stores sat vacant for 3-4 years after the movie theater opened and people moved in; then, after they finally filled up, they started charging for parking because they didn't want to ""loose that revenue"" and then stores started closing.  Then they took away the free parking for the movie theater (validation isn't even as long as a movie now) and that started dying.

So I think the thing that kills the south loop is corporate greed that would rather make 0% while asking for 200% more than they should.",t2_efpab6al,AlanShore60607,0,1648997611.0,0,t1_i389a9l,i389a9l,False,monkeyboats,t3_tva97z,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/tva97z/whats_chicagos_most_mediocre_neighborhood/,What’s Chicago’s most MEDIOCRE neighborhood?,/r/chicago/comments/tva97z/whats_chicagos_most_mediocre_neighborhood/i389a9l/,110,r/chicago,0,110

>Healthcare is inherently expensive, and a fully government ran system would be even more unaffordable

It's almost like the US spends [significantly more](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries-2/) per person on healthcare than literally every other country. Yet somehow we don't cover all expenses for every person the way places that spend less than us like Germany and the Netherlands do. 

It's almost as if there's a bunch of companies price gouging healthcare 🤔

It's honestly upsetting that people still somehow believe the US system is better. Even though there is [overwhelming evidence](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019) to prove that the healthcare systems in other rich countries are not only cheaper, but more effective and improve health outcomes.",t2_5vn0p,Dunkeal,0,1648991439.0,0,t1_i37wt3k,i37wt3k,False,chornu,t3_tujn49,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/tujn49/wttw_cuts_off_health_coverage_for_striking_workers/,WTTW cuts off health coverage for striking workers,/r/chicago/comments/tujn49/wttw_cuts_off_health_coverage_for_striking_workers/i37wt3k/,2,r/chicago,0,2

"Highly recommended is an edition of this.  It has good information on tools and basics, materials and has plenty of excellent drawings and photos to explain things.  If you have an older building, look for an old edition on EBay.  There are topic-specific versions so give it some thought.  Here is the old edition that is great for a house built between 1890 and c 1950.  It has been updated a couple times incorporating more modern materials and methods.
