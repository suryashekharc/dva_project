So this episode was about the Arizona Lights, so they actually went out to Arizona and did an experiment trying to see if the Arizona Lights were maybe just flares from a military exercise.

"My astronomy equipment is useless for anything that moves faster than the planet rotates. Cell phone cameras just don't have the horsepower. I think you would need something wide field but very high resolution. It's the movement that will catch your eye, planes are blinky and slow and move in fairly straight lines and a shooting star or meteor is like a brighter momentary thing right. Imagine something like an ultra high altitude firefly. I believe they are outside our atmosphere or very close to it. Too far away to be anything more than a point of light, but can cross the entire sky horizon to horizon extremely fast like a few seconds. Erratic motion with lots of turns and changes in direction but an overall sweep from the north to the south and back, that's why I said it looks like a patrol. I could never guess what part of the sky one of these strange moving objects would appear, you would just need to record swaths of the sky and hope to catch something.

"So many ufo type stories... 

I got into astronomy a couple years back, picked up a telescope in 18 or 19 and since then I have spent many more hours in the dark staring at the sky than any other time in my life.

There are some crazy objects flying around our skies at night. 

I don't know what they are or where they're from obviously but I can tell you with absolute certainty they are there. 

The first time I saw one I was seriously shook. 
Scared and uncomfortable by its presence. Primal urge to flee and hide. I felt as if it was looking at me looking at it. But I've seen the same thing more than a dozen times now and it's a surreal truly unexplainable experience. 

From my home in the northwest valley it seems like these objects are flying patrols crossing the sky from the northern horizon down to the southern horizon and back up again. Crossing vast distances at incredible speed. 
It's the strangest thing I have ever experienced in my life and it's still going on regularly! 

I invite everyone to find a dark sky site and go chill. You don't need expensive equipment just your eyeballs. In my experience the most active times are after midnight but before sunrise. 

I really don't care to be a ufo or alien spokesperson but for real you go look then you tell me what they are.

"When I was 17-ish, I was out in my dads old Jeep playing around and the damn thing died. I don’t know what broke but it died. Stupidly, I was alone. No cell phone and no GPS, I abandoned the Jeep and started hiking south to where I knew there was a road a few miles away. I made it, got some kind strangers attention and they took me to a phone where I called my dad. 

A couple hours later, he had found me and we drove back to the jeep in the no-guts,  2 wheel drive, light weight S-10 that he borrowed from my uncle, and we got to work diagnosing and trying to repair the jeep so I could drive it out. 

We worked on it as best we could with what little tools we had but finally said fuck it and we will just tow it out with the S-10. By now it was nearly 1 in the morning in the middle of nowhere somewhere between Salome and the I-10, and the small Chevy was just struggling. There were hills and ruts and dips and mounds and at some point it just couldn’t pull the Jeep anymore. But we were so freaking close to the main trail. We just couldn’t get there. 

When…at very nearly 2am, we start seeing headlights over the hill we were on. We could hear an engine. And cresting the hill comes this black Jeep Cherokee with a single old lady driving it. She stops and asks if we are okay. We just say we could use a tug to the main trail. She obliged and hooked up to the Chevy and like a weird train she helps get us all the rest of the way to where we need to go. 

I go to thank her and notice, she looks a lot like Mamma Fratelli from the goonies! Like freakishly like her. And she’s driving the Jeep! Holy shit. My eyes drift to the back where I spy a single very large bag in the back seat of her Jeep. My dumb ass just asks her “so why are you out here so late?” And she looks me dead in the eye and says “I’m finishing up some business, and that, young man, is none of your business. Get on home.” 

Fucking terrifying. I learned that night that no matter how weird people are behaving, it’s probably best to just mind your own damn business.",t2_6mnq7kpw,aznuke,0,1648976669.0,0,t1_i37coap,i37coap,True,hangGlider2019,t3_tv2ixy,https://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/tv2ixy/have_you_seen_or_experienced_anything_bizarre_in/,Have you seen or experienced anything bizarre in the Arizona desert?,/r/arizona/comments/tv2ixy/have_you_seen_or_experienced_anything_bizarre_in/i37coap/,39,r/arizona,0,39

"I used to live in golden valley AZ when I was a kid, right across from my house was a trail that lasted for at least 10 or so miles out into the desert. One night me and my friend pitched a tent in my front yard and we were gonna walk to his house next door to get his laptop late at night to watch a movie. When we got out of the tent practically right on the edge of our driveway there was this wierd figure that just looked like a tall black 2D stick man devoid of any distinguishable features, it seemed to have acknowledged us and then just nonchalantly turned and wandered down the trail I was talking about in front of my house. We both saw it, I have absolutely no idea what it was I saw but it's one of two times I've ever seen something that I couldn't explain and the other time it was the exact same entity in a different location, both times I was with friend's who also saw so I know it wasn't just my imagination.

"Johnny Cash - Ballad of Ira Hayes

Gather 'round me people
There's a story I would tell
'Bout a brave young Indian
You should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix Valley
In Arizona land

'You Can Have Her' — Sir Mix-A-Lot
""I used to have this girl, let's say her name was Mona/Mona, fine young sugar comin' out of Arizona.

'By the Time I Get to Phoenix' (Glen Campbell)
""By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising / She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door / She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin' / 'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.""

""Send Me Down to Tucson"" by Mel Tillis

""Ride Cowboy Ride"" Marty Robbins

Everywhere by Tim McGraw! “Arizona dancing cross the desert”

Don William's- Tulsa time
""I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac, Just about to lose my mind. I was goin' on to Arizona, maybe on to California, where the people all live so fine""

Chris Ledoux This Cowboys Hat.  ""but someone ran him down somewhere around that Arizona line""

"Hey /u/Soggy-Palpitation791, thanks for contributing to /r/arizona. Unfortunately, your post was removed as it violates our rules:

**Rule 10. No fundraising, self-promotion, or spam**

We consider spam not just anything directly promotional, but also anything intended to generate interest for a business, cause, website, or effort when the original poster is not a regular member of the community. Since this forum is “About Arizona, By Arizona” we also consider accounts that mass-post links across Reddit to be spam.  

We do not allow any fund raising links or posts asking for money. We also do not allow posts of referral code and similar promotions as businesses have used those as advertising ploys.  

If you have rarely (or never) posted in the sub before and your first post is promotional, it will likely be removed as spam. The guideline we use is no more than 1 in 10 posts someone makes should be about their own content.

"I will preface this by saying that there are great medics wherever you go, so I’m not trying to trash on PFD with a blanket insult, but as someone who is a non-fire medic, Phoenix fire is objectively terrible when it comes to medical calls, which is most of their calls. Please don’t just aim for salary when looking for a fire career. I personally found Glendale to be the best to work with, and I know a lot of great scottsdale medics. Avondale is hit-and-miss, but the misses are big misses. I think Chandler is decent. I know some great Salt River and Gila River medics, too.

If you're looking at dating and you're in North Scottsdale I would try the Scottsdale Quarter or Kierland Commons. Just get out of your comfort zone and talk to girls.

"Fortunately, I’ve compiled a huge list on my own already, so brace yourself. I have excluded rap songs, because they’re not my style. More country and folk, which, in my opinion, better represent Arizona anyways. I’m always looking to add songs to my playlist, too, so thanks for posting this thread. I hope you enjoy some of these from my list. All of these songs are about Arizona and/or directly Arizona in the lyrics:

1. “Arizona Sky” by Grandpa’s Cough Medicine
2. “Sweet Arizona” by East Love
3. “Goodbye Arizona” by The Sweet Remains. Technically this song is about leaving Arizona to visit California, but damn this is a great tune, so I give a pass to the affront. 
4. “Arizona” by Bailey Run
5. “Arizona Blue” by Fastgun
6. “Sedona, Arizona” by Shane Yellowbird
7. “Goin’ Back to Arizona” by Rick Pickren
8. “There is No Arizona” by Jamie O’Neil
9. “Arizona Whiz” by Cal Smith or Bjøro Håland. Cal Smith is a better known artist, but I prefer the Bjøro Håland version
10. “Arizona Rain” by 3 of Hearts
11. “Arizona” by The Buffoons
12. “Shadow of the Cactus” by Lorne Greene.  This song doesn’t technically mention Arizona in the lyrics, but it’s clearly about saguaros, which are only found in the Sonoran Desert
13. “Arizona March Song” by Rick Pickren. This is our official state song, so it belongs on the list. 
14. “I Love Arizona” by Gianluca Zanna. Great tune, and the best line being “screw you, California.”
15. “Welcome to Yuma, Arizona” by Slick Nickel.
16. “Waltz for Arizona” by Cosy Sheridan
17. “Arizona, Arizona” by Truckstop. This is in German, but damn this is a great tune, especially if you translate the lyrics
18. “So Bad Arizona” by Eastling Gildersleeve Hicks. If ever there was an anthem for Arizona, this is it. They must name every single Arizona city in this song outside the biggest 5. 
19. “Arizona Drifter” by Joe Leja
20. “Rock’n Me” by Steve Miller 
21. “Take It Easy” by The Eagles. Definitely the most well know song on this entire list 
22. “Get Back” by The Beatles. Probably the second most well known song on this list, and it mentions Tucson
23. “Yuma” by Justin Townes Earle. Super sad if you listen to the lyrics, but a great tune. 
24. “Hey Willie” by Waylon Jennings
25. “Ocean Front Property” by George Strait
26. “First Flight to Phoenix” by Chris Rupp. I only know this song from this artist, but he’s awesome. This song is great, and the music video is even better. 
27. “Valley of the Gun” by Tim Griffin
28. “Arizona Yodeller” by Johanna Hemara. This song is sung by a bunch of artists, but I think Johanna does it best. Yodeling is a grossly under appreciated art form, and she is incredible on this song. 
29. “Ain’t No Saguaro in Texas” by The Reverend Horton Heat. Damn this song is funny and true. Saguaros are unique to Arizona. No, they’re not in Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, or California; only Arizona (and the Mexican state of Sonora). It’s a lamentation of a Texan talking about all the people who visit Texas and ask about those giant cacti they see on TV and in movies, only to find out they’re not found in Texas. 
30. “Canyon Grand” by The Sonoran Dog.  A tribute to one of the seven natural wonders of the world: Arizona’s very own Grand Canyon
31. “Arizona” by Josh Kerr
32. “Arizona” by Dan O’Rourke
