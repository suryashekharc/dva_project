"Years ago I went camping out at White Sands with a group. We chose the furthest in spot, a mile from the nearest parking. Five of us and our stuff, crammed in a 7 person tent. We dug out couches and loungers from the base of dunes, the sun an hour from setting over the 70*F winter afternoon.

I cannot remember who spotted him, but in a second we all were looking over to the dune bordering our little alcove. A man in a full suit and tie, sport jacket and watch, was dragging a small rolling luggage along the crest, heading deeper until the dunes. We yelled up to him, asking if he was OK, and he just wanted his free left hand at us, and continued  trudging through the shifting gypsum. We all thought he was insane, but there wasn't much we could do, so we shrugged and went to eat and later played Frisbee with a glow in the dark one under the night sky.

The next morning, as dawn knocked us all out of the tent earlier than we each normally liked to be up, we saw him trudging back out from wherever he stayed, the same suit on and little luggage dragging behind him. We waved and yelled 'Good morning!' but he ignored us or didn't hear us, and stomped on out, presumably to his car.

"These calculations tend to look at wages, and there‚Äôs a wide variety of people who don‚Äôt have wages. Wealthy retirees don‚Äôt have wages. They have non-wage money like capitol gains and dividends and social security.

You have to strip out the non-wage earners and non full time workers, to understand what kind of wages are average.

I 100% get that a bunch of guys in white hoods isn‚Äôt exactly a good look in 2022, but as this quote points out the history of the Gorras Blancas is largely a proud one and it‚Äôs a real shame people are (quite wrongly) conflating them with the Klan.

"The reason NM does this is that registration is a full on regular tax. for example in PA I could simply not pay the reg if I was not driving the car. if I needed to drive the car I just log in to the DMV and ""pay"" it and its good for a year from that date. just don't go past 10 years or they expunge your title from the system (they assume its lost or destroyed)

in New Mexico however car registration is more like property tax (but still cheap like registration is) ie you MUST renew every year (or ever 2 years) no lapse is allowed. 10 days and you get have a fine to pay when you renew. IE they want their yearly tax. at least its cheap :-) the only way to not pay reg property tax is to turn in the plates.

"Los Alamos is even more expensive than Taos because it‚Äôs such a small community and everyone who works at the labs wants to be in town. Most people commute in. 

Ruidoso is very nice. There‚Äôs an issue with people owning second homes there since it‚Äôs such a desirable area, but I‚Äôd still check it out. 

I‚Äôd also apply for Santa Fe and Albuquerque. Santa Fe is pretty expensive but they also may pay a bit more because of it. You might luck out and find something good. Albuquerque has a reputation for crime, but really it‚Äôs fairly localized. Look to live in the NE Heights area and you‚Äôll most likely be fine. 

Also apply for Rio Rancho. They‚Äôre a newer development but growing fast. Depending on your price point you might be able to get a house there.

Selfishly I‚Äôd also say check out the Moriarty District. It‚Äôs east of Albuquerque in one of the farming parts of the state. More conservative but cheap to live in. I‚Äôm in Edgewood which mostly falls within their district and would be one of the better places to live as you‚Äôre close to Albuquerque for any major shopping that can‚Äôt be done locally. 

Honestly, you might have your pick of districts. I‚Äôd probably apply to any and all of them that peak your interest and see what offers you get.

"There are definitely two parties here.  On the one hand, Lorenzo Flores has wanted to do exhibits for quite a while, to highlight Hispano culture.  He is well known locally as an activist and the sort of person who constantly wants to hole city hall accountable.  He led one of the recall efforts against the previous mayor.  He is also on good terms with county officials.  

On the other hand is Louie Trujillo, who wants to bring in tourist and business money for the town while paying lip service to the people who actually live there.  He has brought a lot of construction funding to the town for beautification projects, but they have been focused on touristy areas.  Not a lot that would benefit average people.  And the government agencies outside of city hall have suffered badly the past few years.

And caught in the middle is a chronically underfunded and understaffed museum that for decades has been completely ignored by city hall, up until now.  And I do mean decades.  It is a small museum with a significant amount of deferred maintenance and issues that OSHA would find interesting, but city hall won't devote the funding to fix any of it.

"It's not the exhibit, it's the mayor.  The museum is not allowed to do its own marketing for things, that has to go through the public relations people in city hall.  Not especially after the mayor makes public statements about the exhibit.  City employees can't write up material for the local paper contradicting the mayor if they want to keep their jobs.  It is material from a Penitentes morada that by fascinating coincidence was one visited by some members of the Gorras Blancas.  That is the focus of the exhibit, that it is Penitentes material that is being loaned while the Penitentes are building a new morada.

It is a fascinating aspect of folk religion in New Mexico, the lay fraternities and practices developed on the frontier as people sought their own relationships with their God and their saints.  It is a damn shame it is being closed.

As for the hoods and burlap sacks and flour sacks, what else was there to use to disguise identities?  No ski masks, and wool balaclavas were rare south of the Dakotas.  No pantyhose.

"The complete text of the plaque reads:

In October 1884, seven drunken Texan cowboys committed horrific acts against two Mexican men in Upper Frisco, (modern day Reserve). Just a stone's throw from where you now stand, in Milligan's Saloon, a man known as El Burro was brutally tortured and Epitacio Martinez, coming to the aid of his friend, was bound and shot for target practice, Both men lived. The Frisco deputy sheriff, Pedro Sarracino, outnumbered and overwhelmed, rode to Socorro for help. Nineteen year old deputy Elfego Baca rode back to Frisco with Sarracino intent on seeking justice.

Three days later, Baca observed one cowboy butting another on the head and firing several rounds with his pistol. Justice of the Peace Lopez stood by helplessly, saying the Slaughter outfit had 150 cowboys on their payroll and could not be stopped. Determined and fearless, Baca promptly arrested the cowboy. A large group of Cowboys gathered and demanded his release. Baca shot into the group wounding a man and they dispersed. But the following day, 80 enraged ranch hands rode into the town intent on freeing the arrested
cowboys and avenging the indignity of his arrest. 

A trial was held and the cowboy was released. Baca, sensing a gunfight coming, retreated to a Jacal belonging to Geronimo Armijo and barricaded himself inside. Baca kept his six-shooter blazing for 38 hours, pausing only long enough to cook some tortillas and beef stew. Protected by mud and picket walls, a sunken dirt floor, and an Icon of Nuestra Senora de Santa Ana, Baca braved dynamite and some 4,000 rounds of gunfire fired in his direction by the Texas Cowboys.

On the third day, Baca agreed to give himself up to deputy Ross from Socorro, but refused to turn over his guns. Baca, unscathed throughout the gunfight, had killed two cowboys and wounded two more.

The atrocitles stopped.

I bought a house at peak market prices then had to sell when the market dropped  and lost a huge amount of money. a couple of months after I gave the house away the market skyrocketed and the sold it for big profit. this high price market cant hold on forever. good luck,t2_ik1nspm3,fartcycleboom,0,1648428072.0,0,t1_i2doyj7,i2doyj7,False,fartcycleboom,t3_tpo529,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewMexico/comments/tpo529/are_people_buying_up_houses_in_new_mexico_also/,Are people buying up houses in New Mexico also?,/r/NewMexico/comments/tpo529/are_people_buying_up_houses_in_new_mexico_also/i2doyj7/,3,r/NewMexico,0,3

"Of course I'm a trucker that moved out to eastern NM from the SoCal desert a decade ago. Just now started looking at houses within what I would call a decent price range within the past few years. Looking at trying to get near or in Albuquerque and the prices there are looking quite insane. 


Sad thing is I moved out here by myself to get away from the hustle and bustle, and high prices of CA. Instead it's just catching up to me and there's really no way to escape it with what little education/training I got. Not really looking at having to move again either. And if I do, I'm keeping the search limited to either AZ, UT or NV. CO is nice, but the prices and crowds along the front range where good, local trucking jobs have gotten brutal. Nearby Texas? I'd probably go insane after living anywhere there after several months.

"We moved back here from Japan in 2020, the market was nuts inABQ then and it only got worse since then. I think you have several
Things coming together at the same time. 

1. There has been extremely low home production since 2009.

2a. Millennials like me finally had enough saved up for homes. 
2b. Interest rates were dummy low compounding that.
2c. Old people were able leverage their home values to buy a large number of second homes thanks to those interest rates

3. The move to work from home pushed a ton of people from very expensive places they HAD to live in (Cali, NYC, Seattle, etc‚Ä¶) to cheaper places that they want to live in. Look at Crested Butte CO. 

4. Lumber prices since 2019

That‚Äôs just my opinion though. Write your Congress monster and local counsels. Easiest thing that would help is zoning law reform.

">The median sale price for a single-family detached home in metro Albuquerque increased by 17.2% last year, reaching a record $290,000. The mean, or average, sale price also increased by 17.5%, the largest single-year jump since at least 1985, according to the report.

I highly recommend reading this series from the *Journal* about housing in Albuquerque.

I have summarized and linked to the stories below, but it is no substitute for reading the articles in full.

----

## Part 1: 

[""‚ÄòPerfect storm‚Äô threatens ABQ housing affordability""](https://www.abqjournal.com/2403491/perfect-storm-threatens-abqs-housing-affordability.html)

- ""In May, the median price for a single-family detached home in metro Albuquerque reached $290,000 ‚Äì a market record and a staggering 26.1% increase from a year prior, according to the Greater Albuquerque Association of Realtors.""

- ""Franco said the low interest rates have encouraged local buyers who might have otherwise stayed on the sidelines to jump into the market. ""

- ""metro Albuquerque is on pace to file between 2,700 and 3,000 home building permits in 2021, the highest total in 13 years. However, Bishop cited a study from New Mexico Apartment Advisors that estimated that the city needs 17,000 units to keep up with demand. 'We‚Äôre falling further behind, not even getting close to catching up'""

- ""Before the pandemic, Bishop said the lumber needed to build a 2,000-square-foot home would have cost about $8,000. Today, it would cost nearly $25,000""

- ""Dan Majewski, an urban design consultant based in Albuquerque, said adding dense development, particularly along transit corridors like Central Avenue, will be key as the city grows. He said he‚Äôs optimistic that the city is beginning to understand that denser development will be a priority. The more units that can be built in the existing footprint of the city, the more the city can meet its housing demand without relying on sprawl.""

----

## Part 2:

[""Housing affordability crisis poised to harm ABQ‚Äôs economic, social development""](https://www.abqjournal.com/2404191/housing-affordability-crisis-poised-to-harm-albuquerques-economic-and-social-development.html)

- ""'Certainly for the working population, or the middle class working population, it‚Äôs harder and harder to afford a house,' said longtime Albuquerque City Councilor Isaac Benton, who has for years advocated for investments in subsidized housing.""

- ""What‚Äôs happening in the Albuquerque housing market is not unique. As a new report from Harvard University‚Äôs Joint Center for Housing Studies notes, 85 of 100 large metro areas tracked by the FHFA saw double-digit percentage price increases in just the past year.""

- ""Albuquerque is not yet unaffordable ‚Äì especially relative to other cities ‚Äì but that it is facing a looming crisis because the already limited housing supply will prove even more insufficient as thousands of new jobs come online. He estimates the jobs already in the pipeline at places like Amazon, Intel and Netflix ‚Äì some of which have a multiplier effect ‚Äì will require 29,056 more single-family homes and apartment units.""

- ""Baca is a vocal advocate for denser development, saying the city should encourage the types of high-rise condominiums emerging in other cities around the U.S. He said units in the city‚Äôs few relatively tall condominium buildings, such as Park Plaza near the Albuquerque Country Club, are in high demand. The former mayor acknowledges the concept is likely to trigger backlash among some in the city but chalks that up to 'parochialism.'""

- ""A family moving into a $500,000 condo may put their $350,000 single-family house on the market. That, in turn, creates an opening for someone who wants to upgrade from their $250,000 home, which may then become available for a first-time homebuyer. Inactivity is the true threat to affordability, he said.""

- ""Asked at a recent news conference what the city was doing to protect affordability for existing residents, Mayor Tim Keller said Albuquerque was fortunate because prior price stagnation meant ‚Äúwe‚Äôre starting from a very good place,‚Äù but that affordablity is something his administration is monitoring.""

- ""The city has $11.8 million budgeted for rental vouchers for the fiscal year that starts July 1, up from $9.8 million currently, and enough to aid an estimated 1,000 households.""

- ""An outside 2020 analysis found that the city was 15,500 housing units short of meeting the need of those with extremely low incomes.""

- ""The city is getting over $100 million from the American Rescue Plan Act federal COVID-19 package alone, and Benton said the city should be maximizing it with sweeping housing investments""

----

## Part 3: 

[""Hot housing market edges out would-be buyers, tightens rentals""](https://www.abqjournal.com/2404535/hot-housing-market-edges-out-wouldbe-buyers-tightens-rentals.html)

- ""The average rent in Albuquerque is $1,009, according to a report by RENTCafe, a national apartment listing service. And wages aren‚Äôt necessarily keeping pace. One study suggests nearly a quarter of New Mexico renters are spending more than half their income to pay for their housing.""

- ""'I think that‚Äôs the reason you now have this increased demand for rentals ‚Äì because people who maybe two or three years ago would have potentially purchased a house, those people are getting pushed out of the market because those prices are now higher and higher as well,' O‚ÄôDonnell said. This has resulted in a rise in rental rates not seen in recent history, with some estimates of the increase reaching 7% compared with the previous year, he said.""

- ""Maddox said demand for rentals soared beginning in February. Maddox attributes that in part to vaccine distribution, which she said may have eased some people‚Äôs concerns about moving.""

- ""A 2020 study produced by the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority estimates that nearly 45% of New Mexico renters are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. And half of those renters are classified as extremely cost-burdened, meaning more than 50% of their income is spent on rent. The study also showed that on average, renters earn significantly less than homeowners. Homeowners have a median income of $58,417, compared with renters‚Äô median income of $30,817.""

"Not exactly at this point. - property owners  are selling off at the high price point of the market and it seems like it‚Äôs more or less to the highest bidder than to friends and family.

"I work at NMT and live outside Socorro. 

A vehicle isn't mandatory *in-town* but having some sort of motorized transportation *is* mandatory to be able to get to things not in town. Zenovah's answer is pretty well spot-on: If you want to go out to eat and have something other than the standard trifecta (pizza/burgers/mexican food), you need to get up to Albuquerque. Same with any shopping beyond what you can get at the World's Worst Walmart Supercenter‚Ñ¢ (the Socorro Walmart). I ride a motorcycle probably 80 percent of the time for both commuting to work and for getting small amts of groceries/pet supplies/etc from Belen or Los Lunas or Albuquerque. 

Socorro is pretty safe, except for the areas around Hwy 60 on the south edge of town. Granada street and so forth seem to be where the police action is heaviest, per the reports in the weekly local newspaper. We do have a not-insignificant problem with drug addiction here, so we have a problem with petty ""crimes of opportunity"" -- meaning don't leave things unattended or unlocked or they'll disappear to help somebody get their fix. 

Tech students tend to make their own fun. LAN parties, intramural sports teams, clubs, outdoor stuff like rock climbing, hiking, cycling, etc. The Capitol Bar (located on Socorro's Plaza) is open again, and now has an outdoor patio where you can eat as well. Lots of older Techies and staffers hang out there, and there's a microscopic local music scene there where the musically-inclined locals play pretty regularly. The current NMT president resurrected the local movie theater, and it focuses mostly on new releases, but occasionally shows older stuff for money-raising.

As far as ""looking like an outsider,"" not to worry: we have students from literally around the world and across the 50 states. The pace of life here may be slower than you're accustomed to, though.

"Welcome to New Mexico. While I do not have hunting tips, I want to add a reminder that many active ranches are in New Mexico. Check where you hunt and respect the rancher's property. 

On eleven separate occasions in the past year, I had to help my relatives repair fences and replace chains cut by hunters. Or another hunter set up a tree stand on our ranch without asking for permission and got bent out of shape when we took it down.

Most of the ranchers I know and have grown up with are fine with hunters.
