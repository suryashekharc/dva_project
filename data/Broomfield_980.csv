"Cortland at Flatirons (formerly Catania) is across the street from Terracina, moving away from the tracks, so I highly doubt you’d even hear the train when it comes through, unless you were outside on your balcony (and only if your balcony was facing Via Varra). Trains come through at all hours of the day and night, maybe 3x per day. The trains do blow their horns from far away as they approach, but the apartments are in a quiet zone so the trains aren’t supposed to blow their horns while passing. That being said, I do remember one time when it happened, and it was very loud, but I lived at Terracina and I could see the tracks from my balcony, so take that for what it’s worth.

"This depends a lot on how much time and money you wish to spend, as well as having any other friends who are going skiing with you. Friends who are already local to CO probably have purchased Epic or Ikon passes, or just a season pass to their favorite single mountain.   


I'm a huge fan of cheap, transferable tickets: if you find out you hate skiing/snowboarding or cannot get up as often as you thought, you can always sell them on craigslist. Of these, Loveland 4-pack deals are great. Works out to $50-ish/ticket, get them at the rotating ski shows (Saturdays at various locations - I think the big ""Last Chance Sale"" is coming up).   


Skiing is easier for people to learn, IMO. I would recommend trying it with a rental + lesson package, and pay attention to the sizes of the equipment they give you to have an idea of what to rent/buy in the future. I don't have much experience with different rental locations in the area, I've always just owned mine since before coming to CO.   


Other considerations: driving I-70 sucks. Make sure to add extra time getting up and down from the mountains, have good snow tires. Snow conditions often dictate how much traffic there is (good snow day = lots more traffic). Honestly groomers without a ton of fresh snow are better for learning on, so you don't need to compete with the crowds: pick your days to avoid them.",t2_4fwk0,mtmentat,0,1635976893.0,0,t1_hj7fusv,hj7fusv,True,InterestingDisplay58,t3_qm3uux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broomfield/comments/qm3uux/new_to_broomfield_how_to_ski_pass/,New to Broomfield - How to ski pass,/r/Broomfield/comments/qm3uux/new_to_broomfield_how_to_ski_pass/hj7fusv/,2,r/Broomfield,0,2

That flow chart is awesome. Yes OP you should absolutely buy wheels and snow tires. I've been driving in Colorado for more than half my life now and I will not go a winter without dedicated snow tires even with all my winter driving experience and front wheel drive.

They absolutely did not.  Kohl might have, and from your comment, I'm guessing that's where you have ""personal experience"".  You might want to look into what the other elementary schools were doing in terms of Wednesday starts.

"I’ve been going to a good friend and stylist in Boulder for a few years. I’ve had fashion colors for the last 10 years and she does a fantastic job! She’s at the Color Rad salon, her name is Angela. I have a couple pics on my profile for reference, and I can give you her Instagram if you’d like. 

She uses Pulp Riot on me and I think it’s the best I’ve ever had as far as bleed. It rarely, if ever, stains things like clothes, pillowcases, etc. and my shower is in SO much better shape than previous years! If you’re using cold water and the right shampoo it lasts for a long while too IMO

Edited to link [her Instagram](https://instagram.com/hairbyangp?utm_medium=copy_link) anyway because I think she goes by her own business name despite renting a chair at the Color Rad, so this might be a better place to reach her.

"Arista Broomfield area…

8000 Uptown
Cortland Broomfield
Arista Uptown
AMLI Arista

The entire area is young proffesional with a good mix of family. Dog Parks, well maintained open spaces, and a “main strip” with eateries. Smack in the middle of the 36 junction so you are 20-25 minutes from Boulder and Denver. RTD Flatiron Flyer bus station is right here so for $6.00, you can get an all day pass to take to Union Station in downtown. Excellent area for person/s or families who are fine with apartment or condo living. Target, King Soopers, Sprouts, etc… all your grocers are a less than 12 minute drive from this area. Lots of local breweries a close drive by as well if you fancy that, and, there’s some excellent gems of a restaurant nearby.

Cracovia (authentic Polish)
Burns Pub (excellent from scratch English fare)
Meenas (addicting Indian food, take out only)
Vinca (Swiss/Austrian fare on the main strip)


People are all over exercising or walking dogs here. It’s very well maintained and a walkable safe neighborhood.

"Do you have a car/how far can you go? 

Broomfield isn’t the greatest—it’s not bad by any means but a lot of the more fun stuff is in surrounding areas. If you can get to Boulder, the Pearl Street Mall is a nice walking mall with some cool shops and lots of good restaurants. Louisville and Lafayette both have cute (small town-like) downtown areas. If you like beer, my two favorites nearby are Odd13 (in Lafayette) and 4 Noses in Broomfield. If you can go farther, there are TONS of breweries around, from Avery in Gunbarrel to a whole ton near RiNo in Denver. Huckleberry’s in Louisville is GREAT for brunch. I’ve heard there’s a CrossFit gym at the Broomfield Airport, like in one of the hangars, if you’re into that. 

There are tons of walking trails everywhere you go. Boulder has some hiking trails at Chataqua, you can get up to the mountains in a short time there. Further out, there’s Rocky Mountain National Park in Estes, but you could also just go on a drive up Boulder Canyon toward Nederland to get into the Rockies and have a look. 

For uniqueness, there are two plant-based restaurants in Denver that I like to recommend—City O’ City and Watercourse. Crooked Stave is a top of the line sour beer brewery.

It's super frustrating! I was priced out of Boulder and my rent in Broomfield also went up last year and for next year. They upped the rent again by a small amount in my renewal offer.

"Louisville is incredibly expensive, and the city consists primarily of middle and upper-middle class white families. The city has some good restaurants, and it has a decent network of parks and trails. If by younger people you mean established families, then yes. Superior is the Diet Coke to Louisville's Coke. 

Lafayette is slightly more affordable and certainly more diverse. It has decent restaurants and parks/trails access too. 

All of the cities are bedroom communities, and they are all very similar and easy to travel between.

"Broomfield itself is a suburb utterly devoid of local character or personality. There are no walkable areas to speak of and no notable feel of community. It is bland suburbia. 

I live in Broomfield and I’m ok with all of that.

It has a great location. I can get to Boulder, Denver, and the airport all within 30 minutes. Even closer are the cool little towns of Lafayette, Erie, and Louisville. I rank those three towns in in terms of the order I like to visit, but they all have fun locally owned restaurants and breweries. All three have walkable downtowns with a ton of character and a lot to offer. 

Broomfield’s bang for buck in real estate is the best in the area for a location with this much access. Nothing in this area is cheap, but for the area Broomfield is pretty good.

"From my experience living here for the last few years, there’s a strong community and a lot of people say Broomfield still has a small town feel. It’s pretty quiet and suburban. I don’t think there’s much night life. Higher income than surrounding areas. There aren’t any spots I would avoid but I’ve only lived in one neighborhood. Car thefts/break-ins have been increasing a lot lately, but that’s true of the whole Denver metro area. Personally, I find it great for families but would have been pretty bored if I had moved here as a young single person. The thing I like least is the lack of fine dining; there are a couple good spots (iPie, Proto’s, Zaika, 5280 Burgers) but mostly lots of chains. Thankfully we’re close to Boulder, so we end up there a lot for nicer meals. There’s also a lack of a cohesive “downtown” area, which the City is working on changing, but it will still be a few years out. There was a moratorium on cannabis sales in the city/county but council recently let that expire, so retail will be coming.

Definitely plenty of access to outdoorsy things, but again, Boulder/foothills is where most of the really good stuff will be. Keep an eye out for ticks as well, as neighbors have recently reported finding them on their dogs after visiting local open spaces and trails. 

The library runs a pretty cool maker space called the InventHQ, might be worth checking out as a way to meet people or just have access to cool equipment and supplies. 

Outdoor concerts returning; fun opportunity for a relaxing evening https://www.broomfield.org/3441/Summer-Concerts-Series

"Great info! There is also a dog park at Broomfield Commons off Sheridan and 134th. 

In general, the closer you live to Westminster and the other Denver suburbs to the south and east, the cheaper the rent and homes. The closer you live to Louisville/Superior and Boulder county to the north and west, the more expensive it is. 

The city of Broomfield has been here for a long time, but it only became its own county in 2001. It does not have its own school district so that makes for some weird situations in housing even if you don’t have kids. Mostly it’s Adams 12 school district east of Sheridan and Boulder Valley School District West of Sheridan. Both are good school districts, but many people are willing to pay more to be in Boulder Valley. Houses and rentals in the BVSD will be more expensive.

"Hi! I’m in Broomfield. I can answer most of your questions. 

Jax is a pretty cool outdoor store. Check it out! 

There are tons of breweries. My personal favorite is in Louisville but it seems like there’s a local brewery on every block. Have fun exploring! 

If you start seeing many C130 airplanes taking off/landing at the Metro airport, don’t worry. They are doing their yearly wilderness fire training. 

Speaking of fire, wildfire season is no joke. You’ll be ok in Broomfield but if you go into the mountains please pay attention to the fire danger risk signs. 

Open Spaces are designated public land areas. Broomfield proper has a few Open Spaces available for you to enjoy. 

Burns Pub has the best fish-n-chips. 

If you have a dog, Westminster dog park on Simms is an amazing space but there are rattlesnakes in the summer. We’ve already had the first snake bite of the year. 

Not sure if you’re the outdoorsy type but if so, you won’t spend much time in Broomfield. 

Lastly, always, always keep an extra jacket/beanie in your car. The weather temp can be 80 and then drop 40 degrees within an hour.

"This was literally my SO and I. Wanted to be within walking distance of the First Bank Center so we could take the Freeway Flyer busses. There is parking there, but with that comes break-ins.

We lived at 8000 Uptown and liked it well enough. Was a cheaper complex, but had everything we wanted and is fairly new so it's not run down yet, the people working there were nice enough, and maintenance usually took care of issues. 

My only caveat there is that you need to get a garage both so you have dedicated parking since there are more cars than parking spots and so that no one messes with your car.

"We toured a bunch around this area when we were looking. I guess it depends on what you’re looking for/what your priorities are.

The ones near Walmart have small balconies but larger buildings with indoor entries. The ones on the north side of 36 are definitely fancier but didn’t have very much parking and also weren’t within walking distance of anything. 

Depending on which area of Denver you’ll be working in and where your friend plans on parking at CU, you could try other places. Superior is small and pretty cute.

5280 burger has an incredible mushroom and Swiss burger if you're into that. Ooka Sushi has been a solid choice so far. Definitely, definitely try the ribs at GQue BBQ. 5280 Donuts is really good. Like, really good. 

As far as Denver goes, everything I can tell you about that involves non-pandemic conditions. But once you're able, take your partner downtown and try and just get into the city and see shit. If you're into sports, the sports culture here is great. All sports. Comedy Works has the best stand up comedians in the world come through and do amazing shows. It's commonly a favorite venue among comics. Very intimate and close. From there, check out restaurants on Larimer. It's a street down there that is a great vibe with awesome shops. 

Go out and check out Redrocks Amphitheatre. One of, if not the most iconic concert venue in the US, and perhaps the world. Name a legendary music artist and they've probably performed there. The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix... Even without the concerts, it's an awesome place to go down and walk around, hit the trails nearby. Also Morrison, the adjacent town, is a great little calm mountaib town. Drive up that road into the mountains toward Evergreen just to see beautifulness. Also the road from Boulder up to Nederland is another great way to just see things you don't see in Philly. 

Anyway, enjoy it! This is an amazing place and of all the places I've lived, Broomfield is just such a breath of fresh air. Access to everything. Much love!",t2_3xnii5d3,DNA2Duke,0,1613225847.0,0,t1_gn7tfd5,gn7tfd5,True,kittykat179,t3_l0dvp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broomfield/comments/l0dvp1/moving_to_broomfield_from_philly/,Moving to Broomfield from Philly,/r/Broomfield/comments/l0dvp1/moving_to_broomfield_from_philly/gn7tfd5/,1,r/Broomfield,0,1

The water heater needs some work but we are going to ask them to fix it before close. Some minor electrical things in the kitchen we will also also ask for. The sewer scope looked great. Sounds like unpermitted work is common in CO and in older homes so always possible this would come up in another home as well. The only worry is the garage conversion is probably on a separate slab and that can put strain on the walls. Everything seems to look fine. Our inspector couldn’t see much from the crawl space. Not sure if a structural engineer would be able to see much more if we bring one out.,t2_54fji53b,emilypas,0,1612271305.0,0,t1_glq4n65,glq4n65,False,[deleted],t3_lacjsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broomfield/comments/lacjsk/unpermitted_garage_conversion/,Unpermitted garage conversion?,/r/Broomfield/comments/lacjsk/unpermitted_garage_conversion/glq4n65/,1,r/Broomfield,0,1
"In my experience Broomfield inspectors will ignore unpermitted interior work, unless someone complains.   The risk with open, uninspected work is that the next buyer will take issue with it.   Or, if the work involves new electrical, gas piping or modified framing, those are big deal items in my book.

Since it sounds like you’re concerned with the issue, I’d go down to the City building department and tell them everything you know.   I’ve found them to be very helpful, especially with me as a homeowner / potential homeowner.  There’s a customer service desk in the building department where permits are issued and you can talk to an inspector.  Very helpful.

Some buyers pursue the permit issue, some don’t.   There are plenty of willing buyers out there, as evidenced by the year over year price increases.

Zillow predicts home values in the 80020 zip code area to increase 10% next year, so there’s money to be made.   There will always be issues with a house.  I doubt you’ll find an older (50 to 60 years old) home that doesn’t have a history of repairs on it.  

How old is the furnace?, the water heater?, the roof?.  Had the sewer line video scoped?  An electrician can tell you a lot just by looking at the breaker box panel.   Those are the big ticket items that usually scuttle a deal.

- the drivers are insane. I thought people in the South were reckless but hoooly crap it's a whole other level out here. Not sure how they drive in Philly but it might be an adjustment for you

- it's gonna take you a while to get used to the altitude. I thought I'd adjust quickly but even after 10 months I sometimes struggle. But it's really not that bad, and as long as you don't push yourself you'll gradually get there. I'm miles ahead of where I was in March!

"You’re moving to a suburb that’s a great place to raise a family. The city has grown up a lot over the years especially near US 36, but keep in mind that it’s still a suburb. 

The Burns Pub is my favorite spot. It’s a authentic British pub with an award winning whisky collection. It’s always rated one of the best cocktail bars in the metro area. 

The Old Man is a bit of a dive if that’s more your style. They also have great bbq. The hot links are particularly good. 

There’s about 10 great Vietnamese spots in town. 

Try the Pacific Ocean Market for affordable spices, fish, and produce. They also have a great deli with Peking duck. 

There are also several decent breweries. My favorites are Rail’s End and 4 Noses.

"Hope your move goes well! It's a great place to live,  but there isn't a ton of culture in the city. There is a lot of authentic Asian food and some good pizza and burger places. I just saw today a sign for a bahn mi place going in in front of the home depot on 120th, which qualifies as exciting around here.  There are a few good craft breweries and brew pubs too. The 1st bank center used to have a few good shows each year before 2020. Also check out the Alamo if covid ever ends. If you enjoy walking then taking the flatiron flyer or the b line into Denver is your best bet for entertainment and culture. Or maybe the flatiron flyer to Boulder for a smaller, funkier venue. 

Reserve public campsites or cabins for the summer right now. I'm partial to the lake Granby area, but there are a lot of good choices. If you want a less rugged experience the two ymca camps have fully furnished cabins and lodges. 

I'm from Ohio and Colorado is basically a better version.

"Your survey response was received, and you are right on about the dangerous feeling of Midway and 287! There is an underpass a bit further north near the Discount Tire into Zang Spur Park, but it's over a half mile out of the way just to get there and I don't blame anyone on a bike who just wants to get away from 287 as quickly as possible.   

The city just entered into an agreement with an engineering company to study Midway; it's being called the Midway Boulevard Multimodal Corridor Action Plan and you can read more about it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LuTZVqtRyjSKoEea9J9vamq5jJJpyk8u/view).  With enough resident feedback, I'm optimistic there will be safety improvements for humans along all Midway from the bridge over the train tracks all the way east to the intersection with the Big Dry Creek Park and Trail. Unfortunately the City Traffic Engineering Leadership is pretty old school and tends to view ""improvements"" as ""adding more lanes for cars"" so it will take some activism to add more protections for bicyclists and pedestrians.

Regarding Industrial Lane - Broomfield Bikes did a [post](https://www.facebook.com/BroomfieldBikes/posts/118072016219345) on how awful that street is. The City has a plan to fix it (details [here](https://www.broomfield.org/2797/Industrial-Lane)) however it was delayed due to COVID-related budget trimming last spring. One of the goals of Broomfield Bikes is to make these improvements happen quicker - the plan was complete in 2018 and there's still nothing to show for it!",t2_49mlvg2h,BroomfieldBikes,0,1610904527.0,0,t1_gjmdfgw,gjmdfgw,False,BroomfieldBikes,t3_kxo4p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broomfield/comments/kxo4p2/what_do_you_think_about_biking_in_broomfield/,What do you think about biking in Broomfield?,/r/Broomfield/comments/kxo4p2/what_do_you_think_about_biking_in_broomfield/gjmdfgw/,2,r/Broomfield,0,2

Flatirons has the parking underneath the 5 “midrise” buildings and Interlocken is a “garden style” property with 21 buildings.

Interlocken is technically a smoke-free property (as all Camden properties are) but they do not enforce it as much as Flatirons does.

"I live at Camden Interlocken and transferred from another Camden property in Austin, TX. Ive lived at a Camden property for a total of 8 years now. 
Pros: large balconies, fireplaces, garden tubs (select units), washer/dryer provided, granite counters, quiet, dog friendly, competitive rental rate, very responsive maintenance team, nearby parks, restaurants, and shopping. Great location. They also enforce all rules, especially smoking and noise. The leasing office is quick to respond to complaints. This is definitely NOT a frat house type of community. 
One huge bonus is that Camden allows residents to break the lease without penalty as long as you give 60 days notice and pay one month rent (or something like that.)- it doesn’t go on your record. You can also transfer from one Camden property to another without having to reapply and pay for background checks. 

Cons: the technology package and valet trash/recycling fees are mandatory, whether you use the amenities or not. Surface lot parking can occasionally be an issue, especially for guests and residents arriving after 5pm. 
There aren’t any ceiling fans or overhead lights, so you’ll have to have plenty of lamps and fans. 
The third floor gets HOT, even in 40F weather. Also, the 3rd floor does not have direct access to their garage so it requires walking down 3 flights of stairs to get to your vehicle. NBD when it’s not snowing, downright treacherous with there’s a foot of snow on the stairwell. We’ve been trapped on a couple of occasions when the stairs were too dangerous to use and maintenance had not gotten around to clearing them. Best advice, get on the 1st or 2nd floor and avoid the unnecessary risk of falling. 
This is a non-smoking property, which means no cigarettes, weed, or vaping anywhere. Can’t smoke anything in your apartment, car, garage, or balcony. They come down like a hammer on people who violate this so just be forewarned.

"I'm going to sound paranoid and a bit crazy for saying this, but I'd look into the Rocky Flats Plant before renting nearby. They stopped highway construction that was supposed to go through the area due to high levels of radiation left over from the decommissioned nuclear weapons plant and Touchstone is relatively close to that area...

We used to live at 8000 Uptown and really didn't have any complaints there. Nothing fancy, but 99% of the complexes around the area use the same veneered particle board cabinets and builder grade fixtures. Felt like it was the best value per dollar and they're fairly new and not beat up yet. We were in a 3rd floor unit, but 1st and 2nd floor apartments definitely can hear the upstairs neighbors. 

We liked the Uptown area in general since there were a few bars and restaurants to walk to along with the freeway flyer bus. Super convenient since we were commuting to Boulder and Denver regularly pre-covid. 

Knew some folks who were at Amli Arista and Amli Interlocken and they seemed to be relatively similar quality just more space. 

If you can, I would strongly recommend getting a garage wherever you rent. It was absolutely worth the peace of mind both for break-ins and for always having a guaranteed parking spot since every complex in the area seems to have treated parking as an afterthought!

"Unfortunately this issue will likely never be 'solved'. The oil & gas lobby says the fracking sites are unobtrusive, fall below the state noise ordinance, and are not dangerous. They clearly don't live near them. Since the sites have opened up, residents have lodged thousands of complaints. Most common are the noise complaints. But every time there are noise complaints, the fracking site tests their sound levels, and they always fall within the noise ordinance laws. Those laws are obviously inadequate if the noise still bothers residents. The next most complaint is a smell that can smelled wafting across Broomfield in the early mornings. It smells kind of like sewage, or methane gas. Again, ""well within the state requirements"". And finally, some residents have complained of tainted groundwater. I'm a Broomfield resident who is clearly against these semi-residential fracking sites, so It doesn't surprise me that the homes are cheaper there.

">That is not Trumps fault. And it’s making a strong comeback now.

I don't blame Trump personally for the virus, but the US government's response has been absolutely abysmal under Trump's watch.  You and I have very different definitions of what a ""strong comeback"" is given current unemployment numbers.  Broad stock market indicators aren't proof of a strong economy, they can absolutely be an indicator that confident investors expect improvement that they can monetize before it gets worse.

>are the governors problem for not opening up

Considering pandemic numbers aren't steeply dropping off as Trump's repeatedly attempted to claim is or will soon happen, I can't say I blame them for that response.  State governors and their legislatures don't have the power of the purse like the feds do to make payments that would make lockdown restrictions less problematic and impactful to local economies.

>If your blaming the President, did you give him credit for the excellent three years before the virus?

Did you give Obama credit for the economic & stock market trends that were happening before Trump took office?

Trump claimed he was going to eliminate the deficit, FY2019 it was $984 billion and for FY2020 it's already hit $3.1 Trillion dollars and we've still got over 2 months left in the year, and he's trying to use another stimulus check as a bargaining chip to get re-elected.  How do you reconcile his campaign promises with the abysmal results he's actually achieved?

>I don’t know how many bump stocks you need, I’ve got mine

The way he banned them was stupid as fuck, and nobody was forcing his hand.  Nationwide CCP reciprocity hasn't happened yet either and he's talked about banning suppressors, if you care about the 2A and you still support this asshole I have serious questions about whether you've got enough brain cells to scratch together.

>And ammo is a commodity. Since Antifa and BLM riots, gun and ammo sales are thru the roof. Price goes up

I voted for Biden, but have very little passion for the candidate; he's just a man who I think is better for the job than the alternatives.

"I have had friends in heart breaking situations who have chosen to terminate pregnancy and friends who chose not terminate and deliver babies who did not survive.

I can't not share this, I just can't imagine a hell worse than what will be inflicted on these mothers if this passes. 

Anyone who cares about the sanctity of life and ending ""convenience"" abortions needs to instead focus their attention on expanding sex education, affordable contraceptives, and ending sexual violence.

This prop blocks women from getting abortions after 20 weeks, and makes no exceptions if the mother's health has been seriously compromised (e.g. she has developed cancer) or if the fetus isn't viable (e.g. developing without a brain).

"Am I eligible if my chronic pain is severe, and all opioid pain management has been denied to me for over 5 years? Also if I believe the idea of therapy as a replacement for pain management is an exercise in both futility and human cruelty? (I'm not anti therapy. At all. When it is a reasonable treatment for the issue involved, I promote it myself. But only then.)

I actually enjoy group therapy and would be willing to do this.

But to make it easier: if this is to create a predetermined outcome via a quasi study to ultimately add to rehab center profits, IE if this is a shill study, you don't want me.

But if you really want to put this to the test, real science, hard mode style? I may be perfect for this study. I may have strong opinions, (and strong pain), but I don't stand by anything I haven't carefully vetted beyond myself, and I am fully willing to change my mind based on new information and experience. I am able to set (what I think about a thing) aside and directly observe what is. The scientific method has always been central to how I make decisions.

Let me know if you want me on this. I'll follow through and apply.
