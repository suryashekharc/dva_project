"Been in Prescott for about 10 years.  Moved in my mid 20s.  My two cents:

There are a bunch of retirees and it is what it is.  Some liberal some not.  Most transplants from various other states and that drove housing prices up and up.  

As for younger people there’s a healthy mix if you are willing to get out and meet people. As stated some go to the bars, others rock climb or mountain bike, some sit around and complain about the town hahaha.   Lots of recreational sports also(softball, soccer, basketball, etc).   There’s a gaming shop(think dnd)if throwing dice is your thing.  Small local theater puts on productions.  If you got any hobbies you can probably find a tribe that suits ya.  

LGBTQ won’t be a problem, hell there are drag shows here.  

I think the real question is if you wanna move to the high desert?  If you love the outdoors, like sunshine, and don’t mind a lack of green.

"I’m a liberal in Prescott, so part of me WANTS to have more liberals here so YES Move Here Now, haha. (Ps. I’m actually kinda moderate) That being said, there are some fucking idiots that live here. They are mostly harmless, uneducated people who are easily influenced by Tucker Carlson. But I do have to be honest, there are a lot of Not So Good people that walk these streets.

The upside is, they are poor and probably won’t be able to afford to live here in the next few years.

So, the summers are AMAZINGLY mild compared to Phoenix, the elevation helps a LOT! The winters are mild but can hit hard for a few days a year. I personally like the summers here and the winters in South Africa. The winters are just BLAH from X-mas to about Right Now actually.

It is a charming town, lotsa old people. But safe, comfortable and still small enough to run into a co-worker at the grocery store(which I like). There aren’t a lot of 20 year olds though, they split pretty much as soon as they hit 18. 

Another problem we have, DRUGS. There is a lot of closet addicts and a lot of rehab folks. There are no livable mid-income jobs here. Pretty sure I got the last one, I had to kill a man to get it, lol j/k. But seriously Late March to Mid November it is a fucking paradise.

"I think the response to this question is context-dependent. My experience won't line up neatly with yours, should you move here. What you get from this place depends greatly on what you're looking for. That, and your priors...whatever they may be. FWIW I've lived here about 5 years. 

I just crossed 50, am mixed racially, and am quite active. I absolutely love Prescott's outdoors. Summer gets hot but it's tolerable, and unlike phoenix it actually cools off at night (even on the warmest days of summer). The trails are wonderful. The monsoons are terrific to watch. You get four seasons, and the air is rejuvenating.

People are generally quite friendly. You'll run into the occasional one who isn't, but you'd get that anywhere. Prescott is an overwhelmingly safe community to live in, so that's a major plus to consider.

The politics are unequivocally majority conservative. I don't begrudge anyone their political views, but just know you'd be moving into what is largely populist conservative country. Im a left leaning independent (which is not the same thing as a knee jerk democrat), and i think the ""fuck Biden"" flags are crude and don't reflect well on the town. But I am also a free speech absolutist...so have at it if it helps you sleep at night. At least the ""let's go Brandon"" twist is kind of original 😂

All together, would I build a house here again? Yes. I think the pros definitely outweigh the cons. But if I were younger, more socially active (I'm good with a hike followed by a cocktail and some Netflix most nights), and more progressive I might look elsewhere like Flagstaff or Tucson.

And crate training, my guess is someone left this guy outside because he is pretty rambunctious and very loud. He has tried to tear up stuff in my house within 30 minutes of him being here. So crate training your dog has many many benefits like being able to leave your dog without worrying about him tearing things up. It can also be calming for your dog as well having his own space.

We've had him about 3 hours, we put up fliers in the neighborhood and took him to the local vet to see if he was chipped (he's not he also has no collar) so my guess is someone is at work and doesn't know this guy is missing.

So, call me an asshole all you want. I am right. I would also say he needs to start training for some manners as soon as possible, because has none. But I won't be an asshole about it because this guy is young and the person who owns him might have just got him. But he is horrible in a car, has no recall, he runs from people, and jumps at other dogs.",t2_y8k47,ArizonaGeek,1,1647478523.0,0,t1_i0yk32m,i0yk32m,False,ArizonaGeek,t3_tfwz5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prescott/comments/tfwz5n/found_dog_hillsidelincoln/,Found dog Hillside/Lincoln,/r/Prescott/comments/tfwz5n/found_dog_hillsidelincoln/i0yk32m/,0,r/Prescott,0,0

"I purchased my Scion from them in 2015. In 2016, I asked to be removed from their marketing list. What ensued was literally 6 more years of battling them to LEAVE ME ALONE with physical mail, phone calls, and emails at the very least monthly. I still get stuff to this day. I am far from a Karen and have worked many customer service jobs over the years, so I assure you my approach was never rude or incendiary either. They are just profoundly incompetent. 

Then, my Scion needed warranty/recall paint work done in 2021. It was either them or take it to PHX or Flag. They took my car in on January 30, and I didn’t get it back until MARCH 8. My assumption is that I wasn’t as high priority since it was a manufacturer issue and not a paid service fix. I also needed a windshield replaced during this time frame and they refused to let the glass company access my car at the dealership to replace it. I had to literally file a claim and have it fixed in Tucson the day I sold it to its new owner. Absolutely bonkers. 

I used to work for a local State Farm agent, and my customers who brought their Toyotas to Findlay for engine or body work after a claim were always (maybe 95% of the time) extremely frustrated with the lack of communication and the length of time it took to get repairs done. I always had a hell of a time coordinating service between them and the claims department.

"similar to what another user mentioned that the grandad changed the pronunciation after the war

“ Local historian Melissa Ruffner, who visited the William Hickling Prescott House in Boston in 1998, was told by the president of the organization that runs what is now a museum at the site that it was William Hickling’s grandfather who changed the pronunciation from PresCOTT to PresKIT as a way to symbolize his family’s separation from England.”

Appreciate the insight! We definitely aren't opposed to paying the fees. I've spent a substantial amount of time searching and all of the pet friendly locations explicitly list ""breed restrictions apply"" and/or list a weight restriction of 45llbs or so. I actually just mentioned to my husband I'm now considering drafting a letter to property managers asking if they would be willing to discuss terms (such as us paying extra fees, holding a specific renters insurance policy, and paying a professional cleaning service ourselves when we leave) but I'm never sure how well that will be received. I guess it cant hurt to try.  Any tips or insights you may have would be greatly appreciated. 

That's what we have been hearing! I have family in Prescott which is a big reason we are moving out there. Luckily we have a good amount of equity in our house here.

"**[William H. Prescott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Prescott)** 
 
 >William Hickling Prescott (May 4, 1796 – January 28, 1859) was an American historian and Hispanist, who is widely recognized by historiographers to have been the first American scientific historian. Despite suffering from serious visual impairment, which at times prevented him from reading or writing for himself, Prescott became one of the most eminent historians of 19th century America. He is also noted for his eidetic memory. After an extensive period of study, during which he sporadically contributed to academic journals, Prescott specialized in late Renaissance Spain and the early Spanish Empire.

"In my research on the subject (Yes, I have actually researched this), Mr. William Prescott, who lived in Boston and other towns of Massachusetts, was raised in a well educated, somewhat “class conscious” rich family. He lived in Victorian times and was very much a man of polite society. 
Mr. Prescott had an amazingly interesting life, however, he never visited Arizona and had died long before the town of Prescott was officially established.
Considering the time and places where he lived, and the people he associated, European Royalty, US Presidents, academics from all over the world, he would have never allowed the pronunciation of his name to be anything but formal and proper; as in “Prescott”.
He never knew that a town in the wild, wild west would be named after him, and that people would debase his name in the early part of the Twenty-First century! 
I know that this is just a link to Wikipedia, but it does give a good idea of how amazing a life he lived!

"With the greatest of respect to those that disagree, my family, on both sides, since 1889, were pioneers in what we now call the Quad Cities Area. My Mom who would have been 97 last May and my Grandma, both, told me that at the time of my Mother’s birth and long before, folks pronounced “Prescott” just as it is spelled. It seems no one around at that time would have thought to call it “Preskit”.
I asked them when they started to hear the change in how folks pronounced the name. Both agreed that it was in the late 1950s/early 1960s that the “Preskit” pronunciation started to show up, mainly in visitors to the area. By 1970 it was not uncommon to hear natives of the area pronouncing “Prescott” as “Preskit”. In the time since then it has become quite common. 
I have to kinda laugh when I hear folks state that the name has always been pronounced “Preskit”! It has not!
My mom had a theory about the change in pronunciation, that while I believe it is true, I have no scientific proof of it’s correctness. 
It goes as such: Back in the 50s/60s Arizona’s population started to grow as many people from all over the country discovered that you could live in the heat of the deserts, and they also found out that AZ had cool highlands that were almost perfect to live in! Slowly but surely the population of Yavapai County started to increase in population, especially in the Prescott area. Many folks from around the country decided the Prescott -later the Quad Cities area, was a perfect place to settle and put down roots. Somewhere along the line, the influx of new people in the area changed the the common pronunciation of “Prescott” to “Preskit”.
Mom said that the folks, new to the area, coming from fast paced, hurry-hurry, go fast urban areas, who talked faster than most people in town and they sometimes sounded like they were from foreign counties. She added that the newcomers tended to be lackadaisical and sloppy in their speech, not taking the time to pronounce the town name properly. 
I talked with a lot of my old relatives who grew up in the last part of the nineteenth/early part of the twentieth century before they passed, and confirmed that the town was always called the “Prescott”. 
Personally, I refer to the town as “Prescott”, and not “Preskit”, for several reasons:
1. I pronounce it correctly out of respect for “William H. Prescott”, in who’s honor the city was named. During his lifetime and where he lived (Boston) and also considering his family’s social status, the proper pronunciation would have been “Prescott”. 
2. “Prescott” was how the name was originally pronounced until relatively recently. 
3. Finally, and maybe most importantly to me personally, my middle name is spelled and pronounced as “SCOTT”, not “Skit”. 
I would be willing to bet that all the Nuevo Presscottonians folks who’s family ties to the area, starting sometime after WWII, most likely never knew that bit of History when it came to Prescott. 
(I don’t mind when folks mispronounce “Prescott”, I just understand they have never been taught how to pronounce the name properly.)

"Our real estate agent recommended a great home inspector (unfortunately I cant remember his name and I am at work) but he did a fantastic job. Told us all the good and all the bad so we knew exactly what we were getting into. Our house was built in the late 30's so we knew we were going to have some work.

Our real estate agent did a great job as well. She was thorough and kept us up to date on everything. Stayed within our budget and we found a great house.

The neighborhoods vary greatly, you have the old houses around the square built in the early 1900s all the way to brand new homes off 89a and around the airport (among hundreds of other locations) it really just depends on what you're looking for in a home. The older homes are going to be smaller, they might have bigger lots, and might require some updating. 

For example I am a computer nerd with lots of equipment so I had planned on adding additional outlets plus some on our patio. We planned on the cost to be around $5k but then the city came in and said if you touch the electric panel (which was full) you have to move it and update it because it was not up to current code. Our planned $5k turned out to be $14k. I have other examples but rest assured, everything was double or triple the price and took three times longer than expected. This was all last year too.

New homes have their issue too, but different types of issues. So in some areas that used to be scrub desert, they came in bulledozed it over and stuck houses on the land. Well that digs up rattle snakes, scorpions and other critters. So for few years you'll need to pay attention for those critters. Now this isn't for every new housing development and it typically isn't like an infestation but just something to be aware of.

Our house is just outside the downtown area, between downtown and the hospital. It is an older neighborhood so we have some lower income housing. There are lots of rehab facilities and homeless shelters in our area. My wife was pretty worried about it when we moved in. But so far we've really come to love our neighborhood and have no worries at all. My neighbors have had things stolen but we've never had an issue. The homeless people for the most part are respectful and quiet when cutting through the neighborhood. For us, it adds character to the neighborhood. Having some patience and understanding helps.

Honestly, the issue we have isnt with the homeless people or the people with mental issues, it is the loud ass motorcycles and garage queen 4x4's with no mufflers that come tearing through the neighborhood with no care in the world. You want to race up and down 69? Fine. But don't do it in a neighborhood.

I'll DM you with our Realtor info. She was awesome.

"How about the study where they had a classroom wear masks for 8 hours, and then sent them off to a lab to be checked for how disgusting they were.

"Yes, it's so ""weird"" to acknowledge what even the vast majority of democratic states now recognize.  It's 2022 and it's like you guys haven't had access to the internet for 20 months or something.  What's weird is supporting nonstop masking when there are clear negative health consequences by doing so, without any actual medical evidence or study to ever back it up, even after all this time.  It's totally ridiculous.  Using emotionally charged words like ""weird"" to try and corral people into certain ways of thinking this far along into the pandemic is utterly pathetic.  Even watching the basketball games in California, most people don't wear masks anymore.  It's over.  Move on with your life.

I've been to Potter's House and I am quite sure that it's a money-laundering scheme.

"I used to attend, months ago. I'm new to town and non-religious but we are looking to join a faith. Someone from my husband's work invited us so we went and we were completely ignorant as to its history.

They are often spoken of as a cult but that's not quite the case. I can tell you that from the moment I stepped inside, I had an odd feeling that it was probably a money-laundering scheme. I even whispered this to my husband while the congregation sang at the start of service.

I later found out that the pastors don't have to take any formal religious training. They learn under a current minister for 2 years before being sent off to seed new churches in other parts of the country or around the world. They fast-track new members like crazy with a sort of ""love bombing"" approach. My husband and I were approached by almost every member of staff on our first night there, despite there being probably 100 or more attendees. It was intense. The sermons are also very sub-par. Essentially, service starts with 2-4 songs and a long prayer during which the ministers and congregation speak in tongues, and then a single passage from the bible is read and interpreted simplistically. I'm talking the absolute basic level of obvious interpretation. Then more singing and mass praying and the service is over.

They will also excommunicate members for any reason possible, splitting up families in the process. I became familiar with one such family. The current members do not talk to the excommunicated members, or even really acknowledge their existence, and usually the church will pray for them along with a list of the names of various ""backsliders"" at the start of services. It's very odd, and probably where the ""cult"" rumors originate. There is just a very strange, performative atmosphere to it all that is quite unpleasant.",t2_hurvvt9q,uranus666saturnus,0,1644446751.0,0,t1_hwaexkb,hwaexkb,False,Cammigram,t3_so2xpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prescott/comments/so2xpy/potters_house/,Potter’s House,/r/Prescott/comments/so2xpy/potters_house/hwaexkb/,9,r/Prescott,0,9

"I'm close to $24/hr, supporting my wife and three kids. Wife's income is inconsistent because of the nature of her work... some points of the year its very feast, others very famine.

We got lucky and got a great rental deal downtown Prescott that is affordable and pretty much impossible to give up until we can buy for ourselves (since our rent would instantly go up $600/mo if we moved out), which is looking increasingly impossible because of how much property values have gone up around here.

Unless things level off, it is going to be very hard to stay in the area, which is a shame. My family has been here since the 40's, and I don't really want to move out of area.  


It's more then that though. I have a supervisory level position with the County, which is the only reason I make as much as I do... the pay for anything lower in the totem pole is abysmal and it is making it very difficult to retain people.

Never had any issues with PAH(Prescott animal hospital).   Only place I’ve taken my dog in the last 8 years.   The vet techs are nice and genuinely seem to like animals and the vets have never given me an issue.

"We took our dogs to Harmony, they were good vets but at every turn they try to upsell you everything. And they are crazy expensive. They wanted almost $1,000 for our dogs to get a teeth cleaning. We've always taken our dogs to Chino Animal Hospital when we lived out that way, and it was only like $500 for both dogs to get their teeth cleaned. Now we live in town and the last time my wife took them to Harmony for a checkup, they just needed heartworm tests to renew their prescriptions, the bill was $700 because of a bunch of other stuff they said they needed to do.

Again, good vets but just insanely priced.

If you don't mind the drive or live near the area, Chino Animal Hospital are always awesome and a fair price.",t2_y8k47,ArizonaGeek,0,1640724223.0,0,t1_hqbmhuj,hqbmhuj,False,extralargepopcorn,t3_rqjuia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prescott/comments/rqjuia/veterinarian_recommendations/,Veterinarian recommendations,/r/Prescott/comments/rqjuia/veterinarian_recommendations/hqbmhuj/,2,r/Prescott,0,2
"Second for Harmony Holistic.  Had a real good first impression from them so far.  They are thorough.  Our doctor sat down with us and answered every question, and did not rush the process. They even called us back more than once just to follow up and see how our cats were doing. 

We switched to them after having several bad experiences at Prescott Animal Hospital.    They seem to be really lowering the bar and going for maximum office visits, as well as upselling things you likely did not need.   

We brought our cat in to PAH for a chronic cough, and some IBS issues.  We didn't know if it was allergies, food allergies, cancer, or what.  Showed them a video of him coughing.  The doctor shrugged and said ""huh. that's weird""  as if they'd never seen a cat cough before.  They had no idea and decided that it could be food allergies.  Then switched him to an extremely expensive food that made him MUCH worse.  He broke out in hives, and was losing hair.  Then we brought him in again and they started him on an even more expensive allergy food (which they should have started with) and that gave him uncontrollable diarrhea.  3 or 4 visits (heavily traumatizing him), loaded with inconclusive tests, and food changes.  Nearly $3k in total and all we got was a sick cat in danger of dying from dehydration.    

Their office was AFWUL  when it came to calling us back for this emergency situation.  2 days, 3 call-ins, no return calls.  The receptionist told us they would prescribe him probiotics, which he had already been prescribed.  It wasn't until my wife called in crying in a panic because we needed emergency care that they returned our call to get him fluids and an anti-diarrheal.    I politely asked if they might be able to cut us a break on the price on the last visit, as we had spent thousands and he became much sicker than when we started.  He indirectly indicated that he could not, and tried to suggest our cat started out sick so it was a progressing issue.  It wasn't.  Later, after requesting the medical history in preparation to switch to another vet I discovered that he noted in our account that we ""feel we should be rewarded for bringing our pet in"".    I couldn't f\*\*\*\*\*g believe it when I read it.  I'm pretty sure they did not intend to send the account notes with the medical history.  There was more than one negative comment aimed towards us.    I was absolutely done with them at that point.  We put him back on his original food and he improved immediately.  

Took him over to Harmony and after seeing a 5 second video clip of the coughing issue she said ""Oh! Your cat has asthma."" and offered multiple treatment options, which have solved his asthma AND his IBS issues.  He's healthier than ever now with very minimal treatment.    PAH has grown so large that individual care of their customers is not a factor anymore.  They have more business than they can handle.

"I was born and raised in prescott for twenty years and have lived in flagstaff for the better part of a decade now so here goes:

YRMC is a worthless employer, the benefits are not great and they strong arm smaller satellite clinics into joining their corporation and then all but completely defund and ruin them for the sake of profit. They give no maternity or paternity leave for their workers and the pay is sub optimal. Most of the patients are elderly conservatives and drug addicts so take that how you will and the capabilities of the hospital are pretty limited when it comes to treating serious surgical cases.

FMC seems to be a way better employer with better doctors and nurses but it is a level one trauma center so the stakes can be significantly higher meaning stress and pressure could be too. Flags housing market is close in expense to parts of the Bay Area in terms of per square ft costs at times so prepare yourself for that but FMC seems to pay their people enough to afford to live here.

Being treated negatively sucks.  

It’s how you react to that, and indeed - a strangers attempt to help, that speaks to who you are.

"Prescott Valley has a generally younger (46 v. 58) and larger (44k v. 42k) population than Prescott. I'm in my late thirties with two children and have been living here for 6 years. We enjoy it. My children are in their teens and have never had any issues making friends in the area. 

Arizona is ranked poorly in education, and I would say that this is evident in all of the schools in the area. Every middle and high school in the area is dealing with significant cannabis and nicotine vaping problems, vandalism in the bathrooms (thanks, TikTok), and issues related to being within a major drug trafficking corridor (Hwy 17 & I40).

You can join the fight to make the area a better place, but the Quad area in general suffers from an ""I got mine, fuck everyone else"" attitude towards infrastructure and educational spending.

If you're willing to supplement your child's educational needs on your own, and you love the outdoors and rugged individualism, you'll do fine.",t2_5u8jp,cycle_punk,0,1637260509.0,0,t1_hl5he0n,hl5he0n,True,RidingNaked101,t3_qwb64u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prescott/comments/qwb64u/thinking_about_moving_to_prescott_whats_the/,Thinking about moving to Prescott.

"Prescott itself is a bit dry, but that’s because it’s an old town favored by adults escaping the outside world. The tri-city area however is very nice. Chino valley has an excellent school, there’s a really robust young parent community up here, you just have to give it time and look in the right places. Generally speaking, you meet the right people through connections such as workplace etc. Abia Judd is an excellent elementary school. Be sure you’re coming up for the right reasons, and the community will sort itself out for you. Hope this helps :)

"Credits from Prescott college don't carry over. They used to accept college credits from anywhere in the US but I don't know if that's still true now.

10 years ago, a lot of vets and civilian single moms went to that school because it supported intergenerational populations. That was fucking cool. 

That broke down about 7 years ago when the school needed money and started to market towards well-resourced highschool graduates.

Now the administrative and professoral staff has tried to rework the academic departments to support an increasingly more diverse student population (brown & Black students). After their track record it should probably be understood as a PR resuscitation.

All I can say is that they just want your money. 
Its literally up to you to make a lucrative career out of whatever degree you can buy from them. And I believe people can do that. But it's a small percentage.

It's a free-for-all structure. If you fill out the paperwork correctly, a professor is going to help you modge-podge your credits into something recognizable. 
But they can't provide you with even the most basic job opportunities (which is what most elder millennials remember being promised) like you pay for at other colleges.
 
You will, most likely, meet some absolutely amazing people that change your life. But in the end, you're gonna have to structure your education mostly by yourself. Use that to your own ends.

If you choose this college, I hope you're focused (number 1) and well-resourced (number 2), or you're gonna be ground down to dust. So many of my peers of color peaced out before they wasted their time. Wisely.

It's a ""social justice/environmentally"" focused school, but they aren't radical in any material way. 

It's a liberal paradise. 
Non-effective & self-congratulatory. 

It might be different now & I don't want to dash anyone's hopes. Just do what you wanna do and figure out how to side-step the bullshit.
