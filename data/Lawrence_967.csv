"Hey everybody. [I made a post awhile ago about our local women's hockey league](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawrence/comments/t53wmo/local_womens_adult_hockey_league_recruiting_new/).

We're really excited that this local paper wrote an article about our growing league. A couple of updates from my first post:

- [Our website is up and running](https://www.kcwhl.com)!

- We have a ""Gear Library"" for new players to learn before committing to equipment purchases. Details in the article and on the website. If you or your kid used to play and don't anymore and you have any gear you want to donate, let us know!

- When I posted before we were predominantly playing at KCIC in Shawnee, which is 30 minutes from Lawrence. Unfortunately there wasn't enough ice time available there, so a lot of games will be held at Line Creek which is a further away, in N. KC. (My wife and I live in Lawrence and we think its worth the hike!) Some games will still be in Shawnee. The calendar is on the website.

"This makes sense from a business management standpoint - that increasing cost of living might drive up job applications and allow companies to reduce wages.

But what's hilarious here is people will roundly criticize this one guy, or Applebees, as being inconsiderate assholes for focusing on corporate profits *when pretty much every company and their management think exactly this way*.

What's good for the company isn't always good for employees, in the same way that the purpose of HR isn't to protect you, it's to protect the company.

"Uuuuuuugggghhh.

Leashed dogs can be aggressive. And depending on the type of lead/collar/harness as well as the grip of the handler, a dog can absolutely get out of their restraint.

And even if it doesn't get away? That dog is stressed out and unhappy and possibly dangerous. Maybe it's a sweetheart at home, but the second it starts acting like that, *it's stressed the fuck out*. A stressed dog is a dangerous dog. 

Even if the goal is exposure therapy, a) that shit should be done with the experience of a professional, b) it's not other people's job to accommodate your anxious, potentially dangerous dog, and c) are you *SURE* you're not doing more harm than good?

And yes, I know Rocky is just the sweetest lil baby at home. But as someone who has spent literal decades working with rescue dogs, stfu. Seriously. Shut. The fuck. Up. Sweet babies put in situations they aren't ready for is a recipe for disaster.

"Please get checked with those symptoms. If they dismiss them, find a new doctor who cares to get to the bottom of it or gives you a colonoscopy or endoscopy. 

While still less common, the increase in colorectal cancer among those aged 20-49 have increased dramatically the last decade and are highly curable if caught in the early stages.

I've been handed a miracle in my situation and through some amazing doctors and a life saving second opinion in California as well as at KU Medical Center for a reoccurence, found a way to currently be no evidence of disease but now work for a CRC organization which helps support patients and raise awareness to others about the importance of screening if you are 45+, have a family history, or are experiencing GI distress.

I was shocked because I grew up here but had never seen a groundhog in person until I went to school in the Northeast. When I looked it up online, I found an old blog post from a former KU biology professor that lived in my neighborhood documenting his encounters with groundhogs.

"I want to start by saying that I don’t think the current (or upcoming) plan is a good one. But - this program was not directly focused on reducing speed. The main goal of this pilot was to reduce the amount of traffic going through the neighborhood, and funneling them to the bigger “collector” streets (Maine, Kentucky, Tennessee, 6th, 9th). Those streets are set up to handle higher volumes of traffic.

The thought was if traffic was to those streets, it would in turn reduce the number of people speeding through the neighborhood (which, again, wasn’t the primary goal, but it was a goal nonetheless).

As you pointed out, it may have reduced the number of people speeding through the neighborhood, but it didn’t really reduce the percentage of people speeding through the neighborhood.

Again - I want to be clear that I don’t think this pilot was successful. But I did want to point out that the pilot did actually do what it’s main goal was (kind of). Now, was the goal a good one and beneficial? I don’t think so, but I’m not one to decide that.

"Funneling all the traffic from that neighborhood onto Maine wasn't a good idea, who would have thought.

Edit: Looking at their table of the change in traffic from this first pilot, literally no street saw a significant change in the average or 85th percentile speeds. One of the goals of this pilot was to reduce speeding. In that regard, this was a failure, and I don't see their proposed changes having any effect either. 

Most people drive the speed they are comfortable driving on that street. If you want people to slow down, you have to make it uncomfortable for drivers to drive the speed they usually do.

"This is a project I put together in the past couple of weeks. I loved the Kansas City Kansas Taco Trail, and I wanted to try something similar for Lawrence. This is the list of all of the places I could find in Lawrence that have tacos on the menu. The only real rule is that a place has to have tacos, and I excluded fast food (e.g. Taco Bell, Taco John's, et al.). Unlike the KCK trail, there is no formal orgainzation or prizes for finishing, but this is a comprehensive tour of places to get tacos in Lawrence.    
    
Further notes :  
* I have attempted to include hours when I could find them.  
* I have attempted to link to menus where available, even if the menu is only on a third-party food delivery site.    
*  Lots of the tacos in Lawrence are TexMex or some neuveau gringo tacos, but there are some street taco places around.

"The one on 10th was The End, which stayed open 12-18 months. Just afterward it was 7th Heaven, which remained open a bit longer, until they shut down operations in their Lawrence shop.

From what I understand, The End closed because they hemmorraged money. The whole store was a massive renovation project, and they spent a lot of money on custom woodwork for those listening stations and CD racks as well as a bunch of single disc CD players (they must have had 50 of them throughout the store at least). They sunk a metric ton of money into a business that has o.k. margins and profits; they would have had to have tremendous velocity to make enough to stay afloat. And then they didn't.

 7th Heaven came in afterward and bought most of the fixtures for a song and ran their own style of business in the same place for a while. 7th Heaven sells music, but they do a lot of lifestyle product (e.g. headshop and accessories, t-shirts, adult toys, and other small-but-good-margin products). Without the staggering debt load like The End, and with experience in running a business in other locations, they did well for a couple of years. They supposedly shut down operations because of a potential coming crackdown on stores like theirs with Ashcroft's Operation Pipe Dream that sought to flex federal muscles on weed accessories. Other factors could certainly have been an issue, like internal problems, or the overall reduction in physical media sales that eventually took out nearly every independent music store. They still have a store on Troost in KCMO that has been there since the 70s, but they have closed the Sedalia store.

Source: Lived in Lawrence for 20 years and got some of the backstory of the collapse of The End from the music manager at Kief's, who was talking about how they were offered the chance to buy it, but that the cost / debt wouldn't be worth it for their operations, margin, and overall velocity in music sales.",t2_9f1pm,skelebone,0,1647177243.0,0,t1_i0hldhx,i0hldhx,True,charliedarwingsd,t3_tcwem2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawrence/comments/tcwem2/music_store_that_used_to_be_across_the_street/,Music Store That Used to Be Across the Street From Replay Lounge,/r/Lawrence/comments/tcwem2/music_store_that_used_to_be_across_the_street/i0hldhx/,6,r/Lawrence,0,6

"As a legal secretary and former auto claims adjuster, a diversion is your best bet.  Each court can set their own diversion fees/requirements, but typically you’ll end up paying for the fines and court costs listed on the citation, plus a diversion fee.  As long as your daughter abides by the conditions of the diversion (typically that she have no additional moving violations for 6-12 months, etc.), the citation will then be dismissed.  Contact the court listed on the citation and ask what your options are.  You should NOT need an attorney for this (unless you enjoy paying someone a ridiculous hourly rate to fill out a form and never return your calls…).

However, keep in mind that if the other party had damage to their car and filed a claim for the accident then the diversion isn’t going to do diddly squat.

"**[Twelve Tribes communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Tribes_communities)** 
 
 >The Twelve Tribes, formerly known as the Vine Christian Community Church, the Northeast Kingdom Community Church, the Messianic Communities, and the Community Apostolic Order is a new religious movement founded by Gene Spriggs (now known as Yoneq) that sprang out of the Jesus movement in 1972 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The group calls itself an attempt to recreate the 1st-century church as it is described in the Book of Acts; the name ""Twelve Tribes"" is also derived from a quote of the Apostle Paul in Acts 26:7. The group has ignited controversy and garnered unfavorable attention from the media, the anti-cult movement and governments.

"Those beliefs may sound extreme, but I don't see what makes them a cult? From your description that could be any church in Kansas. I remembered long long ago there was only one church in Lawrence Kansas that wasn't openly racist. What I mean by openly racist is you open the door and see only white people. Doesn't reflect the color spectrum of Lawrence Kansas, which is much more diversified. As far as the beliefs about miss treating women most of them what you describe was legal and acceptable until the mid-1970s. So there's probably plenty of people out there with that set of beliefs.

"You know what, thanks for changing my perspective on that, I don't need to carry around bitterness for that guy.

I remember the first time I saw that guy, it was spring 2017, I was leaving for work, it was like 5:30 in the morning. I was heading south on Mass, and I had just entered the left turn lane to go east on 23rd. THAT guy. That guy.

Lil buddy, you're the one in the way! You're the one driving in the wrong lane ugh!

Anyway, that was only a few months after I'd moved into town proper, and since then I see him all the time honking at people, one solid beep from his little moped. Not ever a friendly beep-beep, just pure disdain for other motorists.

I guess I can relate, people are always doing dumb shit in their cars, and he's on that moped and kinda vulnerable and exposed, and sure, everybody sucks, we are all awful. It's true.

"Agreed.

This town really has decided that wearing masks is some kind of weird protest against the anti-masking remainder of Kansas, where literally there are no mandates left. But they just LOVE their masks here. It's time to make it a personal choice and stop forcing kids to wear them all day, they are hot and uncomfortable and I have a son who is literally crying several days of the week before he has to go into school with the damn mask on, and he is miserable with it! Has even been going to the nurses office for a break frequently from it so he can calm down and is missing class. The weather is about to get warmer which will make this a worse problem. I am so sick of this town and their ridiculousness. Get vaxxed, wear a mask if you want, but stop it with enforcing something that needs to be a personal choice now. You will lose a lot more kids in the school district, which is not something you can afford right now, including my own next year unless the mandate is dropped.

"Avoid En-Tire Car Care. 

I had issues with my old car where I had bad acceleration and a whining sound reminiscent of a bad serpentine belt. They replaced the belt and looked at it 3 times before the manager said, ""That's just how your engine sounds."" The issue was never resolved. I know it was dumb to give them a third chance but I did.

I went to the dealership about it and they told me right away my catalytic converter was clogged and the sound was from a leak in my flex pipe caused by the back pressure. It was slowly wrecking my engine. They replaced the converter and the flex pipe and it immediately solved all issues. 

A code reader was all it took for the dealership to figure it out. If you offer auto diagnostics, maybe use a diagnostic tool. I'm not sure if En-Tire has the tools for replacing a converter but they could at least inform the customer of the issue.
