"D'après un article du Globe and Mail, si je me souviens bien, les taxes supplémentaires au Qc sont nécessaires pour administrer le Régime de rentes du Québec et Revenu Québec,  bien que j'imagine qu'il existe un transfert de fonds fédéral pour couvrir certains de ces coûts. De plus, le Québec a des « ambassadeurs, ou attachés » dans différentes grandes villes des États-Unis et d'Europe, pour promouvoir la province.

Le Québec a maintenu pendant des années un budget équilibré, d'après ce que je peux voir, tandis que l'Ontario a enregistré des important déficit budgétaire d'année après année, alors équilibrer le budget ici est assez impressionnant.

Les soins médicaux et l'éducation auraient la préférence sur la réfection des routes. À Aylmer, le chemin de Lucerne est une allée de nids-de-poule, devait être réparée il y a 2 ans, mais la démolition de l'ancien édifice du Centre de Ville municipale et la construction du nouvel édifice auraient pris une partie ou la majeure partie de l'argent qui aurait été consacré à la réparation de la route.

Cela dit, quelqu'un à qui j'ai parlé (un conseiller?) m'a dit que les pénuries de main-d'œuvre du personnel routier étaient également à blâmer.

Les élèves du Québec ont régulièrement obtenu les meilleurs résultats aux tests nationaux et même presque les meilleurs aux tests internationaux, alors nous avons un bon système scolaire, bien de sorte que la qualité de l'éducation peut varier d'une école à l'autre, tout comme les services hospitaliers. Nous avons trouvé que le pire enseignant du secondaire auquel nos enfants étaient inscrits était dans le programme d'éducation physique, où un professeur d'art a décidé d'enseigner l'éducation physique et était totalement incompétent et en raison de la protection du syndicat, l'école ne pouvait pas faire grand-chose à ce sujet.

Si vous êtes victime d'abus en ligne parce que vous êtes un ""anglo"", cela montre une étroitesse d'esprit. Peut-être que si les Canadiens de Montréal pouvaient embaucher le meilleur entraîneur, même s'il ne parlait pas français, ils auraient encore quelques coupes à leur actif...

Nous sommes chanceux que le gouvernement du Québec a choisi, il y a plusieurs decennies, de bâtir des plants de génération hydroélectrique et non nucléaire, comme l'Ontario.

"Data of what properties in the area sold for recently including what upgrades the house might have, square footage and land size. I.e If you're looking at a house posted at say 300k but the most recent houses in that neighborhood (same number of rooms, square footage, identical lots) have been sold in the past 3 months at 500k it indicates the house is underpriced to create a bidding war assuming it's in the same condition structural wise. It also helps you figure out what's overpriced. If a 3 bedroom 1960s home (not updated) in a neighborhood that isn't of high demand is posted for 600k but the comparables show 2 houses recently sold in that area for 300k (some updated) and 1 fully upgraded at 450k, it's obvious the house is overpriced. Comparables help set the price point. 

That's why it makes it difficult to figure out what is really going on in the market we (the general public) can't see the sold data (not easily). You can pay $1 per house to check it's sale history but you'd need to know what the address of a recently sold unit is first of all and it easily adds up. It should all be public data.

"When buying a house in Quebec, you have 15 days to have all conditions met (including the sale of your current house). If you don't sell your house during that time, you won't get the house you bid on.

Because of this, it's usually better to sell your current house before you buy, if you use it toward down payment for new mortgage. You don't have to close the deal, which is the final step, just sell - you'll get a final letter which will be enough to satisfy that condition. If you can buy the house outright then it doesn't matter.

Even so, with the current market you have a good chance of selling as soon as you make it available, so really it's up to you.

Le terrain est encore polluer a cause de l'ancien dépotoir, Il y a encore beaucoup d'émanation de méthane (et autre gaz) etc... Ca couterais terriblement trop cher pour faire quoi que ce soit la.

"Yes, the GP has the autonomy to diagnose ADHD and prescribe the meds. This was actually the reason why I went to a specialist, because the GP just prescribed them to me after a paper questionnaire. I think they also have the authority to adjust the meds - last time I saw a GP, I asked to do a sleep study, but she said we'd first have to discuss the ADHD drugs and if the dosage needs to be adjusted.  Granted, she knows I'm seeing a psychologist, so I can't say with 100% certainty that you don't need to see a psychologist. Unless you're an extreme case, you most likely won't have access to a psychiatrist.

Since foreign doctors and nurses often need to start all over, or close to it, when they arrive here, I've wondered if setting up Canadian standard medical schools in a country such as the Phillipines to have their students study, train and test under those standards then give a certain % of those students the opportunity to immigrate to Canada.

"Thank you so much, this is really really helpful. I'm happy to hear that the doctor you met wasn't too obsessed about the 'addiction' factor - it worries me that in some places they're so stigmatising, when after all we're only 'addicted' to the way the meds help us...! 

So just to understand - if I assume that my Australian diagnosis is accepted and I don't need another assessment - all I might need to do is to find a GP who (upon accepting the diagnosis) is willing to continue to prescribe my meds, based on my Australian diagnosis? 

And this would continue - no need to revisit a psychiatrist/psychologist after that? Here in Australia my GP prescribes the meds, but asks me to see my psychiatrist every 6 months or at least once a year to discuss the effects of the meds, and to adjust the dosage if needed. Can the GP in Quebec adjust the dosage without the specialist? 

&#x200B;

One last question: here in Australia there's a number of facebook forums where ADHDers exchange information and experiences, but I haven't found anything similar in Quebec/Canada. Would you know of any? I find it really helpful in terms of navigating the health system as well as the diagnosis itself.

"In Quebec, school taxation is governed by the [Education Act](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/i-13.3). You usually pay the tax to the school board having jurisdiction over the territory of your house. If you have two school service centres in your jurisdiction (one English and one French), you can elect to pay one or the other unless you have children enrolled in one or both.

In this latter case:

>The school tax levied on an immovable owned by a person who has children admitted to the educational services of a school service centre having jurisdiction over the territory where the immovable is situated shall be collected exclusively by that school service centre.  
>  
>Where the children are admitted to the educational services of different school service centres having jurisdiction over the territory where the immovable is situated, the school tax shall be collected exclusively by these school service centres, each on a portion of the standardized assessment of the immovable corresponding to the ratio between the number of those persons admitted to the educational services of that school service centre and the number of those persons admitted to the educational services of all the school service centres concerned. The school service centres concerned may enter into an agreement in respect of the terms and conditions for collecting the tax intended for each of them.

You have until April 1st to submit the change.

"That's from actually talking to a person or a recording?

I was just commenting to my wife today that in Aylmer, we have a Liberal  MPP. The CAQ have a majority so our rep can't help us much. 

I haven't a clue if different sectors of Gatineau have different MPPs, maybe there's a CAQ rep somewhere you can talk to, in person. 

I wonder if going to the news media would help...?

"Great idea, thanks so much! The following is essentially what I said in my email.

Hello,


I have serious concerns about the accessibility of the following website: https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/contact-us/make-a-telephone-appointment.


Firstly, there are never any appointments available. I understand that appointments are booked over 30 days out currently; while problematic in itself, the wait time is not my main concern. There needs to be a waitlist option on the above website or, failing that, an option to let us make appointments past the 30 day mark. Even advertising an exact time that 500 new slots become available each morning would make registration more accessible, though I believe this website and procedure still requires a major overhaul.


Secondly, there must be other options available than going online to book a telephone appointment, as that process presents several accessibility concerns. What if a citizen is deaf or hard of hearing? What if they have no internet access or telephone? Going in person to an SAAQ location should be sufficient to obtain an application form.

The current procedure is unacceptable and presents serious obstacles for citizens of Quebec to gain access to much-needed health care.


I look forward to hearing solutions.",t2_b2vfje8q,RedeemingAegis7,0,1647982359.0,0,t1_i1pl5r8,i1pl5r8,False,RedeemingAegis7,t3_tk9dr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gatineau/comments/tk9dr6/please_help_us_get_health_care/,Please Help Us Get Health Care!,/r/Gatineau/comments/tk9dr6/please_help_us_get_health_care/i1pl5r8/,2,r/Gatineau,0,2

When I pointed this out, they went mute, then claimed they wanted someone in Orleans. I told them they should update their job posting so people won't waste their time like I did and of course they didn't because they were full of it.

"Aylmer is relatively close to Ottawa via the Champlain bridge. For some reason, crossing bridges is seen as a big deal in our region.   


On the plus side, Aylmer is pretty awesome. There are quite a few places on la Rue Principale which are really great spots. Maybe bring your friends there and win them over to this side?  
A few recommendations:   
\-L'autre-oeil for craft beers

\-Cassis for some great Gelato / Sorbet  
\-Chocolats Favoris for awesome dipped ice cream  
\-Amazonas for good Peruvian food (which is pretty rare to find)

It's really too bad, because Aylmer actually feels like an Ottawa suburb and its cute little ""downtown"" area is very anglophone friendly. You could try to lure them with a nice day at the marina parc/Beach with a picnic and then have a pint on the local brewery's patio (5e Baron).

"Quebec has a different political culture than the rest of Canada.

Canadian conservatives have certain beliefs that are somewhat alien to Quebec.  Things like militarism and the monarchy..  dare I say imperialism?  Maybe it's not quite glorified anymore,  but more ambivalence towards the days of the British empire exists elsewhere than in Quebec.  In Quebec it's outright rejected as a dark period in history.

Quebec nationalism is a different fish.  It's more of a reaction against the old status quo than an embrace of it like elsewhere in Canada.  Strangely,  both Quebec nationalists and progressives are to the left of the Canadian mainstream.

But the main thing is that no one in Quebec really pays any special attention to the rest of Canada.

"No apology needed :) 

There are two separate but related massive projects proposed  1) the new regional hospital and 2) a new highway #550 (Deschênes corridor)

The new regional hospital would increase total available beds, and two or three of the existing small hospitals in Gatineau would close (Gatineau sector, Hull and Buckingham). So the location of the new mega hospital needs to service all of Gatineau, from Aylmer to Buckingham.

While I agree there could be some benefit if more people in Chelsea have options to take the bus, realistically buses aren't that well used by people who have cars. I think any benefit of this potential added bus would be more than lost by the inefficiency of access to other parts of Gatineau.

They can certainly send buses up to the proposed north location but it would be much better if it was accessible by a future rail system. There has long been talk of a tramway from Aylmer to Hull. If we never implement any commuter rail, traffic will never improve. 

The boul. de technologie location would mean people from Aylmer still need to bus or drive to central hull and go north from there. People from Buck would likely need to take two buses instead of just one. In that situation, few people opt to take transit. The province could then use all the increased congestion on the highway 5 as rationale to build a new highway 550 which they have wanted to for years- cutting right through Gatineau park, limiting wildlife movement, increasing pollution and noise in the park.

The site favoured by the province would reduce building costs to the province but increase costs to the municipality, as there will need to be supporting infrastructure and upkeep (water, sewage, snow removal and transit). Think not just about the hospital, but likely other businesses could grow in the surrounding area- meaning more sprawl.

The mayor, city council and STO all support a location closer to ""downtown"", that would be closer to reach by the 148 and 50 and still accessible by the 5. Their thinking is that this could be an opportunity to revitalize part of hull, as a major teaching hospital would stimulate nearby service businesses and be accessible by the college. 

In my view we should be trying to think forward and reduce our car dependency and city maintenance costs. This is why we can't even afford to maintain current roads. We need to also protect the park which is a huge attraction for the city.

However building in a more central location would mean needing to build taller, include underground parking, and remediate the soil, all of which costs the province more up front, so I am pessimistic it will ever happen.

"I've moved from out of province and below is what worked for me, it may not work internationally, but it'll give you some ideas where to start.

If you have a prescription, see how you can get it transferred over. When I lived out of province, my family physician, who initially diagnosed me, prescribed a low dose stimulant to hold me over for 3 or 6 months when it was time to move. Then, I had my pharmacist call a pharmacy in Gatineau to transfer the prescription. 

Once in Gatineau, I could continue my meds until I settled down. I was able to book an appointment with Medigo (a next-day walk-in clinic) and explained everything with supporting documentation. The doc prescribed the same thing for 12 months. I was actually surprised that she did prescribe it to me and didn't treat me like an addict who was trying to get stimulants, which was the case in the other province.

Like another poster mention, the default option is to go to emergency, but it's hell, and the wait times are abysmal. Apple Tree Clinic in Ottawa, which is more accessible, won't prescribe stimulants, regardless if you have a diagnosis or not, so don't waste your time on hat.

In Quebec, psychiatrists are for more extreme cases of mental health, so you won't be able to see one easily. For a formal diagnosis that is accepted by institutions in order to get accommodations (work, University), you would need to get tested by a neuropsychologist. I did that, and the doctor could not diagnose me based on my results. However, there is controversy in the field and the relevance of those tests, especially when it comes to adult ADHD. I was lucky to find a psychologist to start therapy through here: https://www.ordrepsy.qc.ca/english 

Just get as much in writing as possible should you need to make a case that you have a diagnosis and a prescription history.

"Historically there has not been a conservative party in Québec at the provincial level. The Union Nationale was very popular but they died with the quiet revolution and the political spectrum moved to the federalist-separatist divide.

The PCQ is a new party and has gained some traction with people who would be considered to be more on the edge of the political spectrum, closer while still very different to the federal Conservatives. And the federal conservatives have not gained any significant support in Québec since Mulroney won in 1988; there was some success in some regions (Québec Cité and Beauce for example) but that was it.

The CAQ is probably closer to a progressive-conservative party, with more emphasis on the ""progressive"" than in Ontario, and they have made huge gains at the last election because the nationalist voters moved from the Parti Québécois to the CAQ slowly since the early 2000s (the CAQ did not exist then but the ADQ took those votes). While it was slow, people moved *en masse* to the CAQ in 2018 because they were tired of the liberals and the Parti Québécois wasn't really an option anymore.

As of why they're so popular today? The Liberals have not convinced anyone from moving back, the PQ either, so they managed to keep high numbers. Because Quebec Solidaire is also competing with the PQ you end up with a divided opposition and more CAQ candidates will get elected if it continues to the election.

The nationalist agenda was popular, the management of the pandemic was at the beginning and it fell dramatically with the measures announced in December, the CAQ lost a lot of support but they were so high that the estimates didn't show much of a difference in terms of seats won.

So here's that, as long as the opposition is divided and the CAQ doesn't mess things up they could be there for a while, but in politics you never know, the Liberals will likely come back as they still have a strong base in the anglophone communities of Montreal so they will likely not disappear, or Quebec Solidaire might eventually aim closer to the centre and gain traction... who knows.

"Same, I don’t get it. It’ll melt anyway, and shoveling is such a bad way to keep in shape. I’d rather get my bike. And if it’s to get the gravel off the lawn, it doesn’t work.

"Bien que la nature des fonctions varie énormément à travers les équipes et les ministères, il reste que presque l'entièreté des fonctionnaires est en télétravail depuis 2 ans. Adopter une approche qui laisse place à autant de discrétion aux directeurs pour décider le modèle de travail mènera à des directeurs qui se retrouveront sans personnel si ce directeur exige une présence physique de ses employés, pour ""aucune"" raison, par exemple. Une directive plus uniforme venant du SCT serait une meilleure approche d'après-moi, en laissant une marge de manœuvre pour les besoins opérationnels réels (par ex.: devoir travailler sur des document classés ""Secret"" non disponibles sur des serveurs à distance). 

Et je ne crois pas que les managers ni sections heads ou directeurs ont davantage d'idée de ce qui va se passer. Mon directeur n'a absolument aucune directive sur l'avenir du télétravail.

"Lots of good advice here.  Make sure to read the details of your insurance coverage- there is a lot of variation between providers about what types of mental health providers they cover.  Also double check if you need a physician referral to get coverage.    
Lots of good Ottawa therapists and usually no issues with providing service to Qc patient.  We’ve also had good luck with Montreal based professionals providing virtual services.  We’re able to access specializec therapy that wasn’t available in Gatineau.  

Don’t wait for a Dr appt to make a psychology appointment- there is usually at least a few weeks of wait for psychologis seeing new patients- book your first appointment and then go to Appletree to get your referral.    


The other thing is that the Telehealth line 811, has a mental health option.  If things ever become very difficult for you, call 811, option2. You can talk to a psych nurse and they can triage you and refer you to available services in your area.  This was a huge help for us….and I don’t think it is well known.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Je crois que ton exemple de suit de clown est tiré par les cheveux. Je suis avocat et aucune directive de mon employeur ne pourrait me forcer de porter un suit de clown pour exercer mes fonctions au sein du gouvernement fédéral. Le droit de gérance d'un employeur et les directives qu'il peut émettre ont plusieurs limites, notamment les droits fondamentaux tels le droit à la dignité. À moins de travailler dans un cirque, je n'aurais aucune obligation de porter un costume de clown au gouvernement fédéral. 

Cela étant dit, je comprends le point que tu essaies de faire: le droit de gérance de l'employeur permettrait probablement de forcer le retour des fonctionnaires. Je pense quand même que des questions se posent dans la situation - pour l'instant théorique - où un retour serait obligatoire alors que d'autres ont été engagés à travers le pays pour exercer les mêmes fonctions que celui qui est forcé de se présenter.

I'm starting to think that the amalgamation of Gatineau is truly showing the city's inability to handle  the logistics of such a large territory. 
When they can't even draw an intervention plan for some of the city's most important roads that have become km-long washboard (looking at you lagappe,  Lucerne and our flagship Allumetiere), how are we to believe they will ever address the craters in our residential areas that are just waiting to claim our cars/bikes or even ankles if you're not looking.

"Dear minister Bussière,
I am writing to you about my frustration to obtain medical services in Gatineau.
It is no secret that Health care in Gatineau is deficient. There are not enough doctors. There are not enough nurses. It is hard to make peace with the fact that some people may develop terminal or serious conditions that could have been prevented if they had access to treatment.
We are deserving of adequate healthcare as we Quebec residents pay our taxes. I know I’m not alone and there is a large number of people hoping to get the health services we deserve.
I am aware that the last two years have been difficult on all fronts. We all went through it. Now that Covid is coming to an end, I believe it is the time to reassess and make meaningful changes in order to deliver the healthcare expected of a G7 country.
Respectfully,
So and so",t2_8mg7p5yk,No-Structure-7188,0,1647384091.0,0,t1_i0t7wg4,i0t7wg4,False,No-Structure-7188,t3_tem7o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gatineau/comments/tem7o4/end_of_covid_restrictions/,End of COVID restrictions .,/r/Gatineau/comments/tem7o4/end_of_covid_restrictions/i0t7wg4/,2,r/Gatineau,0,2

I've tried calling numerous times to find a family doctor/get a health card, but the line just hangs up on me.
