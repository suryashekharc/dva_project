My dad worked for coke for almost 40 years. He worked for the one in Kalamazoo for most of his career until they shut the plant down and moved to grand rapids. Now I believe they are talking about shutting the grand rapids one down too. He is now retired but he said it was a good place to work and made a lot of friends. It's also demanding on the body though he was a warehouse worker and lifted soda pallets and operated forklifts.

The Air Zoo is truly one of my favorite places in SWMI. Arrive any time and have a great time! The simulators are still closed (stupid Covid) but everything else including the kids room is open now. I’ve been taking my kids since they were toddlers. It is very friendly for kids- not a “velvet ropes don’t touch anything” kinda place. The volunteers there are super nice and will offer free tours and are crazy knowledgeable. The other building is worth a stop too to see even more planes and the restoration work. The folks that work on the restorations are retired military typically and super sweet. Some of the guys are in their 80s and 90s and will answer any question you have about old planes. The food upstairs in the main building is pretty good- it’s run by Millennium. The cookies are especially good.,t2_ewegknc0,CantaloupePurple2289,0,1648172699.0,0,t1_i20f9n8,i20f9n8,True,cinnabunny88,t3_tn6ajv,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/tn6ajv/anybody_been_to_the_airzoo/,Anybody been to the airzoo?,/r/kzoo/comments/tn6ajv/anybody_been_to_the_airzoo/i20f9n8/,2,r/kzoo,0,2

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

"Oh, well that's good to know! Most of the things on my Avoid list are from what I've seen others say on reviews and other reddit posts (as I said before, Candlewyck is the only one I have personal experience from) so they might not all be terrible, that's just what I've been told.

Another thing to keep in mind though is that things can change with a company/apartment complex pretty quickly. Right now I live at Candlewyck. I've lived here for 6 years and for those first 4 years I would have been more than happy to recommend others to live there. It wasn't perfect, but it felt comfortable and quiet and safe, and for the most part I trusted the people working in the office. Over these past 2 years though things went sharply downhill. It's no longer safe, things are being broken and destroyed all around the property and inside the buildings, there is trash everywhere, they can't keep up with basic maintenance tasks, and they can't keep a manager to save their lives (I left a proper and very lengthy review on google lol). The managers just keep quitting over and over and over again. I don't even have somewhere lined up to move yet, but all I know is that I need to get away from here as fast as possible. So if it's been a couple years since you've lived at any of those places, things could be very different now. Ooor the reviews/advice I read could have been from just an unlucky tenant in an unlucky spot at their apartment complex.

"Many of these items are already in place, so they should theoretically have no cost associated with them.

If you compare this initiative with the ""Secure MI Vote"" petition, it would incur numerous additional expenditures and has no clear method of paying for them (which is the point -- they seek to burden local clerks of court with undue restrictions and generally hamper voters ability to cast their ballots).

- Military and Overseas ballots are currently sent to overseas voters, and the Secure MI Vote petition seeks to change the state constitution so that they are only counted if they are *received* by election day. Protect the Vote 2022 seeks to ensure that as long as these ballots are postmarked by the election day and received within 6 days of the election, they are counted. This is a zero cost initiative, if the Secure MI vote petition gets its way, it would hamper voters from casting their ballot by restricting the dates in which a valid vote can be cast.
- Michigan __already allows__ voters to voluntarily show ID or sign an affidavit to their identity (voter ID is not required). The Secure MI Vote petition wants ID, specifically a state drivers license, in order for voters to cast a ballot.
- Michigan currently maintains a permanent absentee ballot list. This means the state sends you an absentee ballot application for each election in order for you to request an absentee ballot. 
**IMPORTANT TO NOTE:** Absentee ballots are not automatically sent to you! The Secure MI Vote petitioners incorrectly assert that absentee ballots are automatically sent (and that this contributes to widespread voter fraud) -- both of those assertions are incorrect. The Secure MI Vote petition would remove the ability for voters to be on the permanent absentee ballot list, in addition to making requesting an absentee ballot much more difficult (you have to send a photo copy of your drivers license IN THE MAIL with your application for each election!)
- State funded postage is new. Currently they send out applications / ballots and we have to provide the return stamp. The good news is that ""business reply"" rates are published and for large organizations like the state government should be relatively affordable. The petition does not specify how this would be funded, but it does provide that local election offices can use charitable contributions (which must be disclosed) to fund these initiatives. An important thing to note is that the Secure MI Vote petition would set forth numerous restrictions on local election clerks WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY FUNDING RECOURSE for those to be enacted.

“Michigan does have a voter identification requirement at the polls. Voters are asked to present an acceptable photo ID such as a Michigan driver's license or identification card. Please note that voters who do not have an acceptable form of ID or failed to bring it with them to the polls still can vote. They simply sign a brief affidavit stating that they're not in possession of a photo ID. Their ballots are included with all others and counted on Election Day.” 

Your vote is counted in Michigan whether you have ID or not.

"Most of the good things in the area are not in the city of Kalamazoo unless you are a college age drunk and think craft beer is actually something worth a darn. Portage has the air zoo, which is awesome and right by it is airway lanes (bowling laser tag arcade outdoor adventure course when the weather is good). Downtown is expensive and can be dangerous at times. (not that I wouldn't go there with my kids yet if I had a really good reason but it's getting worse with the bs low or no bail left wing criminal justice system). Kalamazoo Valley museum is very cool and kid oriented. Air zoo/airway is not dangerous at all and is in portage. Also latitude 42 is right by there... a brewery type restaurant. As an added bonus you can see the some of the 80 billion Pfizer fleeced from the govt at work as they developed or made the covid vaccine in the factory on that road with the airzoo etc. Building new buildings. Summer time there is outdoor stuff to do and trails and a few other things like others mentioned fish hatchery to the west a ways. Chick-fil-A down on Westnedge Ave in portage if that's an attraction for you. Along with tons of other typical shopping areas. But yeah if there was one thing in kzoo area worth seeing as a guy is the air zoo. Remember there is another building to it as well.

"The Wheelchair Hockey League of Michigan, with the support of the Michigan State University Adaptive Sports and Recreation Club, is proud to announce the first wheelchair hockey clinic in SWMI! 

Wheelchair hockey is an amazing sport where athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities can competitively play together on the same floor! The only requirements to play are that you are at least 10 years old, you can control your own wheelchair (power or manual), and that you have the cognitive ability to understand the rules. Outside of these basic requirements, we will work with you to maximize your abilities, and get you in the game! 

Whether you are looking for a new recreational opportunity, a competitive outlet, or a sense of community, this is a great opportunity to find all of that and more!

Registration is open now until May 14th!

To register, please fill out this form: https://forms.gle/62bbWjxRicu4N96A7

"You can get some limited produce from Crisp Country Acres at the winter market and they are your best bet for true local produce. If you want organic and mostly local try the Food Co-Op. 

Fresh Thyme is owned by Meijer so it might be smaller but it is owned by a corporate giant if that is important to you. 

While Horrocks might have some local produce while in season they also have a lot of stuff that is shipped in. My mom swears by them but she has purchased cauliflower and broccoli for me that was from California and really not good. 

Honestly not a whole lot is in season right now so you are not going to find a ton.",t2_gskd8,mothernatureisfickle,0,1647714287.0,0,t1_i1b53iu,i1b53iu,True,blvavckloon,t3_thz923,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/thz923/best_produce_in_kalamazoo/,Best produce in Kalamazoo?,/r/kzoo/comments/thz923/best_produce_in_kalamazoo/i1b53iu/,5,r/kzoo,0,5

I hate to say it but Meijer is pretty good for normal stuff like berries, etc...mostly because they have extremely high turnover.

"After a few months of searching (and failing with the online restocks) I was able to score one from Best Buy the other week. Found a helpful tip on Twitter. 

Download the Best Buy app and search for PS5. Make sure you’ve toggled the location-specific search on and select your store. If the console appears in the search, they’ll have them, even if it says not in stock. 

Last week I saw tweets that they’d have them on Thursday or Friday. Thursday night, checked the app and both the digital and disc version appeared, though they were listed as out of stock. Drove up Friday at store open, walked in, asked an employee and bam — snagged one. 

A few other people must’ve used the same strategy because like 8 of us walked in right as they opened the gate and immediately asked employees 😂. One kid walked out with 2 of them. 

I can’t guarantee it’ll work but it’s worth trying and infinitely less depressing than adding something to a cart 100 times to come up with nothing. 

Good luck!

"We lived there from 2016ish-December 2020. The new buildings are meh and more expensive so you must be looking at the old buildings. We lived in the 3rd floor 2br lofts, which were incredible. Two outdoor wooden decks in the canopy of the woods, huge vaulted ceilings. There’s a really nice pool and great space to walk around. It was quiet (except for construction). We still miss it often. 

That being said, the old buildings are definitely old. Keeping our apartment warm/cool was a challenge, but we also had 20ft+ ceilings. I have heard that the lower level apartments have mice pretty often. We had two or three over the years we lived there total. 

The laundry situation sucked bad (one laundry room with two machines for the whole 12-apartment building). The managers in the office were bozos (especially David). Always do the math on rent increases, and don’t expect any action on issues until you mouth off a bit on their silly online message board system for all the tenants to see. However, if you have things break inside your apartment, the maintenance team is quick and pretty good.

"I lived there a couple years ago, in an older unit (not their new fancy ones). I loved it, it's quiet and peaceful, and the grounds are beautiful. It's very safe, my biggest concern was raccoons in the dumpster at night.

"Yes I read the article. What you’ve seemed to miss is the fact that the Kalamazoo location is merely an “outpatient clinic” and not a specialty clinic. My dad sees several specialists ranging from Battle Creek to Grand Rapids, and sometimes even Ann Arbor. And the transportation services offered to him are simply reimbursement checks which he receives after the fact. That does not pay for the gas costs up front. Often times by dad finds himself “broke” almost immediately after he receives his SSI deposit, which quite frankly shouldn’t be happening. 

Getting off topic here. According to my calculations, my dad receives roughly $1,700/ mo which adds up to just over 20k a YEAR. That’s well below the poverty line and yet he doesn’t qualify for assistance from DHHS for things like Food Stamps. The only reoccurring expenses he has are insurance for 2 vehicles and his phone bill. As previously stated, my dad is essentially homeless, he is currently staying at his sisters house while she and her husband are snowbirding in Florida. 

Now to get to my point. Overall, the treatment of veterans and low income people in America is horrendous.

"Thank you for the response Chris.  I appreciate you are against the bailouts and Congress trading stocks because both have hurt our wonderful country enormously!

I also appreciate your honestly about needing to know more about PFOF.  With all the issues out there, I don't know how anyone keeps them all straight!

PFOF is another thing that has hurt every American with a 401 or who is involved with the stock market on some level.  Payment For Order Flow is the compensation and benefit a Broker receives for directing YOUR order to different parties for trade execution. It is the incentive for the Broker to NOT get you the best deal because they are paid handsomely to route your order elsewhere. It is banned in the UK, Australia, and Canada.  In just Q1 of 2021 Robinhood made $331 MILLION on PFOF for your FREE account! [https://www.protocol.com/fintech/payment-for-order-flow](https://www.protocol.com/fintech/payment-for-order-flow)

Sounds like a no-brainer, but you wouldn't believe how many in DC are fighting to keep it.

"Alright, so that is a pretty open-ended question. The criminal justice system does require some reform. One of the biggest reforms would be the decriminalization of ""victimless"" crimes, primarily drug possession. This is a disproportionate part of our criminal justice system and drug enforcement has shown to be enforced in discriminatory ways. Ending things like three strikes laws and mandatory minimums would also be helpful. The ""tough on crime"" policies of the 90's did not help, it made things worse. Incarceration is expensive, and does little to reduce recidivism. Other options should be considered. 

The criminal justice system is also painfully slow and painfully expensive. I do not have the answer, whether it be having more judges or more attorneys, but the definition of a ""speedy trial"" as described in the Constitution needs to be updated to be faster than it is now. Access to legal advise should also be made more easily available. The size of your wallet should not decide how good of a legal defense that you get.

"The issue that we are currently seeing in states (including our own, as you point out) is why I stress that it is still the Federal government's responsibility to protect the civil rights and liberties of citizens in all states.

I believe in a single payer health insurance system because it offers more equitable coverage at a lower cost. Employer-based healthcare is an issue for many reasons, including the fact that some employers don't even offer it, or if they do, they offer bare-bones expensive plans. Being tied to employment also makes it difficult for people to leave jobs for better opportunities or to try and start their own business. 

A single payer health insurance system simply changes *how* your healthcare is paid for, not who provides it. It's still the same doctor or hospital, but instead of Blue Cross or United paying the bill, it is the single payer insurer.

"The hospital really doesn't matter unless you have a high-risk pregnancy or give birth significantly prematurely. In those two cases, Bronson is a better choice. For all other pregnancies, the hospital is borderline irrelevant. The doctor is far more important. Finding one that you like and agrees with whatever birthing plan you want should be the first step. Whatever hospital they have privileges in comes second.  

Bronson is a local healthcare group and has spent a lot of money on advertising and their image. Borgess is part of Ascension, which is the something like the second largest healthcare system in the United States, doesn't seem to care as much about their local image.

"My general rule of thumb is everything with the exception of some universal welfare programs (food, housing, Healthcare, education), oversight of companies that operate in multiple states (interstate commerce) and ensuring the protection of civil rights and liberties.

The greatest worry that most people have regarding states' rights is attacks on voting, abortion, etc. by states. The federal government has a responsibility to step in when there are constitutional violations.

"I believe that I mentioned on my website that I believed Michigan's term limits were too short. I stated that I understood that it takes time to become a good legislator. My proposal was 10 years in Congress and 12 years in the Senate. That to me is reasonable. I disagree that term limits are the reason why interest groups have so much influence- ALEC is the primary legislation-writing group and they operate in states with and without term limits. 

My stance on equity- that is rather vague, but I will attempt to answer. I believe everyone should be treated fairly regardless of their age, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. We do see disparities on a systemic level- not a result of individual persons, but rather on the way the system is structured. 

Regarding law enforcement and George Floyd, I believe that incident was so egregious that even most law enforcement condemned it. Some still made the excuse about drugs in his system, but that likely comes from a knee-jerk reaction to always defend law enforcement. I've noticed a huge difference between the way law enforcement views incidents versus the way that the general public or activists view incidents. The best way to solve this would be honest and open discussions, however that does not happen and in many instances, officers are not allowed to give their own personal opinions to the public, so that does not help.

The Democratic Party is redeemable because almost everyone is redeemable. It is an institution made up of people, and people can change or be replaced. It's up to them to change. Why do they need to be redeemed?

"Another point that I wanted to make was that due to the nature of my career path (I work in the criminal justice system) and my political identity as someone on the left, I frequently get to be ""in the middle"" of certain issues, which has made me have to step back and analyze situations objectively. That does not mean always staying neutral or taking the middle ground on issues. It means I am able to understand different perspectives. 

I am frequently around police officers and politically I am around progressives and activists. They disagree on a lot of things. With my law enforcement experience, coupled with constantly being around progressives, I can understand where they are coming from. Sometimes the police are right, sometimes the progressives are right.

"I have not spoken much with Alfonso, so I do not want to make direct comparisons. I do believe that fundamentally we have different political philosophies, so I think that as we have further discussions, those differences will appear and you can decide which one aligns with you specifically. 

 
All that I can say is that my political philosophy is based off of the power dynamic in our country. Who has the power, what are they doing with it, and who should have the power? This is because I believe that the more that power is concentrated, the more likely there will be corruption. So, concentrated power must be limited by decentralizing power, or at least by ensuring that those in power are transparent and are held accountable.

 
Currently, those who have power are politicians, the economic elite, and large corporations (all of which overlap with each other). In a perfect world, the people hold power over the politicians and hold them accountable, and then the politicians hold power over corporations (laws/regulations) and hold them accountable to ensure that they are fair to their workers, the environment, and the communities in which they reside.

However, what we see is a vicious cycle of politicians and the economic elite benefitting each other instead of the country as a whole. Corporations and the wealthy donate to politicians, politicians pass legislation that is favorable to their donors, then when politicians retire they get offered jobs by their donors to become lobbyists themselves- thus restarting the cycle. This is done by both political parties.

Then, politicians try to divide us. We are told that immigrants are the problem, people poorer than us are the problem, people of the opposite party are the problem- when the real problem is that neither political party is representing the people. It’s not hyperbole- there was literally a study that was conducted that showed that the opinion of the American people has a “near-zero"" effect on what laws are passed in Washington DC. 

The reality is that regular voters aren’t as different from each other as we think. We all have the common interest  of wanting a decent life for ourselves, our family, our friends, and our neighbors. Corporations have shown that they will do almost anything- offshoring jobs, automation, layoffs, stagnating wages- to maximize their profits at the cost of the American worker. Not to mention the pollution that they cause as long as they can get away with it. 

While corporations don’t care about the well-being of their workers and the community, workers (voters) have a vested interest in the success of both the company that they work for and the community in which they live. 

So, we need a new strategy for a successful America. The power needs to be with the people, because collectively we will want what is best for the ourselves and the country. 

I’ve identified three groups that have the power: corporations, the wealthy, and politicians. Who do we, the people, have power and influence over? Realistically, there is little we can do about Amazon or Jeff Bezos. But we do decide who is elected to office. Then in turn, those who are elected can impose laws and regulations that ensure corporations treat their workers, customers, and community fairly. 

It is not a simple process, and it is not an easy process. I talk to a lot of people who are apathetic about our entire government and electoral system. And they have a right to be. Things haven’t changed dramatically in a way that makes people think that their vote matters. But as long as they believe it, they will be right. We need to vote out corrupt politicians, and vote in politicians who will genuinely represent the people. If they fail to follow through on their promises, vote them out too. 

It is important for a politician to understand the dynamics of power. Not just the dynamics between people, government, and corporations (private sector), but also the dynamics of power within government. I’ve come across politicians who I agree with on certain policies, but they do not wield their power as legislators. They have the ability to block votes, to apply pressure, and so on but they don't. Even of they don’t have the power, they should make a stink about it. For example, if I proposed a bill to cap insulin prices and no one would cosponsor it, or if it stalled in committee, I’d be talking about it everyday and calling out those who are paid off by the pharmaceutical industry. 

I apologize for the long answer. I didn’t want a generic “I’m a good leader"" or anything like that. And to me, actions speak louder than words. Unfortunately, since I’ve never been an elected official, you don’t have actions of mine to look back on. So the least I can do is give meaning behind my words and provide as much detail as possible  which makes it harder to backtrack on, which is what some politicians do when they keep their policies vague.",t2_ks1w9hk4,Glasser4Michigan,0,1647456102.0,0,t1_i0x1dx5,i0x1dx5,False,Glasser4Michigan,t3_tfldeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/tfldeb/chris_glasser_for_congress/,Chris Glasser for Congress,/r/kzoo/comments/tfldeb/chris_glasser_for_congress/i0x1dx5/,24,r/kzoo,0,24

"Good question- in regards to US intervention, I am referring to unilateral military intervention, which is the kind that the US uses the most frequently. In that context, ""national security"",  means credible threats against the United States. No more ""nation building"" or fake WMDs to get us into a 20 year war. Further, any military action needs approval from Congress. Most of our conflicts (usually involving drones) do not have authorization by Congress.

Our drone war has largely been a failure, killing countless civilians. By doing so, we are not protecting our country from terrorism, we are participating in terrorism and radicalizing civilians in those countries, which creates more terrorists.

Any action on the basis of humanitarian intervention needs to be done in cooperation with the United Nations. No unilateral action whatsoever. 

In the instance of Ukraine- no military action. They are not a part of a defense pact, so we have no legal responsibility to intervene.

"Our family is not a big fan of the SPCA. First of all they import dogs from other communities so they have a lot of dogs in their building from southern states. If you go to Animal Control you will find a full building of dogs from Kalamazoo. There is absolutely no reason the SPCA needs to import dogs from Texas. 

Second, these people are not affiliated in any way with the ASPCA yet they really do not discourage people from this misunderstanding. A few years ago my parents were looking at adopting a dog and when I asked them about their relationship with the ASPCA they told me that all rescues work together for the greater good. 

Third, they do not treat heart worm disease correctly and are essentially adopting out heart worm positive animals with a death sentence. They treat heart worm positive animals with the “slow kill” method which is a horrible way to slowly kill a dog (I don’t know about cats) and is cruel and just because it’s inexpensive should not be considered a ‘treatment’.  

Lastly, while I appreciate adopting an animal can be an adventure (the last two Aussies my husband and I have adopted from other shelters have ended up costing us thousands in medical bills after we got them home and discovered they were not “healthy” like the rescues said) the SPCA is not great at being transparent with their animals. When my parents went to visit with some dogs we were told a couple dogs were friendly and social by one person and another person told us that those animals should not go to a home with children. We also ran into one dog with an  “I bite” notice on their pen and staff told us the dog was friendly. When I asked about health records of a dog who had been surrendered locally I was told they don’t release those and we would need to have our own vet redo all vaccines. 

As for your costs and expenses- welcome to the world of pet ownership. Our senior Aussie had to have 12 teeth removed (our vet believes it was prior neglect) and her ears surgically cleaned out because they were so severely infected. She also was heart worm positive so she needed injections, steroids and antibiotics. We spent thousands of dollars on her before she had even lived with us for 7 days.

"I don’t think you’ll ever get your money from them. I’ve been involved with local and national rescues as a foster/intake/committee member/ adopter/ transporter/ and volunteer education facilitator and it’s not uncommon for this to happen with rescues. I’ve known of animals adopted out with a suspected foreign body (from eating a toy while in rescue) that the foster parent begged a rescue to pay for the removal of and the rescue refused. I adopted a pug who (luckily) only had a vaginal infection after a rescue put her on a transport across international boarders because the head of the rescue was totally ignorant about a female dogs heat cycle. Dogs that were adopted as “healthy but elderly” with numerous (sometimes life threatening) aliments. That list includes five dogs I can think of off the top of my head and encompassed everything from seizure disorder to heart issues (which led to the dog being euthanized less than a week after being adopted). A cat that was adopted out as the opposite gender with a mouth full of broken teeth that needed to be extracted. My point is, that while rescues do good work overall, that many of the people involved have no idea about decent medical care and are either unwilling or unable to educate themselves enough to adopt out animals whose health issues have been probably addressed.",t2_cfjgp2km,sneakyshitaccount,0,1647376081.0,0,t1_i0snao9,i0snao9,True,[deleted],t3_teyr7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/teyr7m/the_spca_should_be_held_accountable/,The SPCA should be held accountable,/r/kzoo/comments/teyr7m/the_spca_should_be_held_accountable/i0snao9/,5,r/kzoo,0,5
"I am from Canton (went to the Park for HS), I'd say the vibes are slightly different, but not too different.
