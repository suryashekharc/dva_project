"I really agree with the spirit of your comment, but if I had any inkling of hope that Higgs' government gave a fuck about the population of NB (nevermind the homeless population) I would probably have called them out in my comment. But they barely even pretend to care.

Am I glad the government of New-Brunswick ignores its responsibilities? Not at all, and it sucks that the problem has been dumped on municipalities with way less resources. That doesn't change that the Cons aren't and will not ever do anything to address these issues, and at this point trying to get them to do anything vaguely progressive is simply naive. 

Dawn Arnold and her crew at least play the game of pretending to care, so maybe we can shame them for having more than 50% of their 2022 budget allocated to the new RCMP facility instead of something that could actually help Moncton.

EDIT: I have to say I disagree with your second paragraph; in my experience the trend seems to be people blaming everything on the federal government, despite many of their complaints being under provincial or municipal jurisdiction.

"The vaccine was never intended to be a cure for covid, covid is past that its more of a flu shot type of deal. The shot was always intended to help fight off covid, curb unnecessary death and shorten the period in which individuals had covid. The co-morbidities present in a lot of covid deaths are common, asthma, respiratory diseases, auto immune deficiencies are all co-morbidities, really a lot of these restrictions are no worse than having your flu shots up to date and not bringing peanut butter to school because of allergies. We’re well at the point where people are flat out saying that those with asthma deserve to die due to the inconvenience their condition places on them, which is a having an up to date flu shot and wearing a cloth in public spaces. I also have no idea what you are referring to when you talk about transmission of the vaccine??? This is clearly just some copy paste rhetoric you barely understand, I truly think that if those who died of covid did so at home instead of in isolation behind closed hospital doors the majority of people would have a different opinion on it. 37’000 preventable Canadian deaths are really on the heads of those who don’t trust doctors prevention advice yet seek them out for any immediate medical problems.",t2_oh4ua,lustarfan,0,1648218224.0,0,t1_i22gxg1,i22gxg1,False,remog,t3_tn8rpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tn8rpk/so_called_freedom_convoy_setting_up_a_very_loud/,"So called “Freedom Convoy” setting up a very loud shop across from the courthouse and next to the Moncton Press Club.

"Yeah the public reaction to this pandemic was awful. A bunch of people who think their freedoms were squashed by having to wear a mask, stand six feet apart and get a vaccination after already receiving dozens through their lifetime. 

With my natural immunity I should have been barred from things because I’m sick and I don’t want to spread it to someone who may die. I have sick time so I used it. My girlfriend doesn’t so she’s out there having to work with the public and spreading it. It’s insane. 

If you’re mad that Facebook is censoring things maybe it shouldn’t be treated as a source for news. How about going to the news sources for that and forming your own opinion?

We didn’t have the transmissibility data. We do now and there’s no vaccine passport. At this point I agree, don’t get the shot. Who cares. You’re only hurting yourself. I got my three doses and covid has been a mild inconvenience for me. Someone I know who didn’t is getting his ass kicked for the last three weeks.

"it be nice to have some reassurance that it wont happen again. The public reaction to this pandemic was awful. winning the hearts and minds of people is just as important . When we are expected to take the word of professionals and not make any or most information. 

We have so little control over our own lives it would be nice to know I could freely make choices about my own health.

in your case with natural infection why would've you ever been barred from anything?

 Why were children forced to take the vaccine when less than 30 under the age of 20  died from covid and the average age of death was 82.5 as per BMJ.

So why would people still be protesting? here's a few reasons that come to mind

&#x200B;

\-Private enterprise notably the tech industry has been censoring doctors essential deciding what is true . Do you really want some billionaire deciding what you ingest as information online? hell Facebook had censored the bmj for potentially misleading information one of the oldest general medical journal creator of the double blind study 

\-The loss of bodily autonomy. Now to save lives one could argue that is similar to wearing seatbelts but . Pfizer never tested transmissibility of the vaccine and vaccinated people can still transmit so where is the cost benefit analysis? why is it not made for the individual? For example 89% of covid deaths across all ages had co-morbidity's . now i can only speculate but I would assume that 100% of those deaths under the age of 20 likely had co-morbidity's

\-Using coercion for vaccination. Some may of been ethically sound but not when it involves money or food (not necessarily counting restaurants)

\>being refused service based on vaccination status

\-Transparency . All the data should be available to the public so that any misgiving may be addressed tough not everybody will accept the information presented it is important that they are available 

I've yet to be convinced that most of the measures done during the pandemic were for the greater good such is my pessimistic view on politics generally speaking the worst come to power best of luck to all and hopes all is well

"Not quite. 

Right lane for turning right. For right indicate right on approach.

Either lane for straight ahead (assuming a two lane roundabout with both lanes exiting - which is how every roundabout SHOULD be designed and built.) For dead ahead do not indicate on approach but indicate as you pass the last exit before the one you'll take. 

Left lane for turning left. For left indicate left on approach.

Actual exit numbers are irrelevant as not every roundabout has only three exits (exactly left, dead ahead, or right) many have lots.

I agree with your points. But:

There are a lot of roundabout's in Moncton with a spurious right lane that is a solid do not cross line (when you can even see it), but you can cross it - and people do because you have the usual procession of idiots in the left lane not realising they are cruising along in a passing lane, or because they want to turn left in 10 kilometres time.

Take a look at the 'roundabout' heading to Dieppe from the ring road for a good example. It was clearly designed by a child during bring your kid to work day. 

Roundabout at Riverview before the causeway is the same, more slip roads off the side you're meant to not cross from but people do, because they have no idea wtf they are doing.

In all my years driving in Europe I've never seen a roundabout designed like that, cause it's a terrible design!

If people could learn the basic rules of the road (right lane for driving left for passing and do not cross a solid line) it would help everything work better.

Never mind the fact that fewer than 1% of drivers approaching or exiting said roundabout's use a turn signal correctly and roundabout's are a dangerous proposition here.",t2_80dk55v,Chris-WIP,0,1648163145.0,0,t1_i1zttbl,i1zttbl,False,rorix39,t3_tm2hmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tm2hmt/the_zipper_merge_traffic_technique_explained/,"The zipper merge traffic technique, explained",/r/moncton/comments/tm2hmt/the_zipper_merge_traffic_technique_explained/i1zttbl/,5,r/moncton,0,5

"I lived in Switzerland for almost a decade. In German-speaking countries it's the LAW and you are expected to do the zipper merge. And what you describe above is exactly the point. 

The idea is the same as a roundabout — everyone must encounter the problem using the exact same solution. That strips out the complexity. The problem with non zipper merges is that it's every man/woman for themselves. Some people wait, some people are polite and let people in. Some hop on the shoulder to race to get to the front of the queue, etc. That's what creates ""friction"" and increases traffic delays. 

Ditto with roundabouts — everyone must enter and exit the intersection using two right hand turns. You enter the roundabout by making a right hand turn, you exit the roundabout by making a right hand turn. Four way stop intersections don't work on the same logic. Some people want to drive straight, other's left, other's right, whose got right of way? Oh but who got to the intersection first? But that lady's being really nice and waiving through someone who doesn't technically have right of way. 

Same problem. Same solution. When you can find a way to transform drivers' disparate wants and needs into a single solution that EVERYONE must follow, it eliminates friction and makes everything more efficient and enables everyone to get their differing wants and needs much more easily.",t2_62pi2whw,Smurfin-and-Turfin,0,1648148888.0,0,t1_i1yuczi,i1yuczi,False,rorix39,t3_tm2hmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tm2hmt/the_zipper_merge_traffic_technique_explained/,"The zipper merge traffic technique, explained",/r/moncton/comments/tm2hmt/the_zipper_merge_traffic_technique_explained/i1yuczi/,6,r/moncton,0,6

A lot of cities have already been working toward those kind of changes. Moncton's City Council is aggressively trying to grow the downtown area to improve population density, just like any other large city does. Most cities are installing trails, bike lines, and shared routes to promote non-automotive forms of transportation. The problem is that this all costs money and takes time to implement.

"apparently my original comment of ""this guy pad thais"" was not deemed worthy by the mods. Probably for not ""sufficiently adding to the conversation"".

Well allow me to elucidate, having made pad thai at home before, this is a good recipe. I find tamarind paste to be a little hard to work with and usually soak it in warm water and then strain, because you don't really want the fruit fibres in your food, but otherwise, this is legit. Good choice of ingredients too.

"Here's my homemade pad thai recipe: 
SAUCE
2 TBSP tamarind paste (Pantai brand at Oriental Market, West Main)
2 TBSP white sugar
4 tsp fish sauce (Three Crabs brand, Oriental Market)
1/2 tsp ground chilis

This is enough for 1/4 to 1/3 package of wide rice noodles. Soak rice noodles overnight or at least 3 hours in cold water. 

Bean sprouts - half the volume of rice noodles 

Cooked proteins, ie chicken - half the volume of bean sprouts, diced or sliced small.

1 minced shallot or equivalent of minced onion
3 minced cloves of garlic

1 egg 

Green onions if you like them. 
The cooking part takes 5 mins to have everything prepped and in place. 

Heat a bit of cooking oil in a large frying pan to medium. Add shallots and garlic until it smells good. Add noodles and stir very quickly. Add sauce and stir very quickly. Make a small space in the middle of the noodles and crack the egg into the pan. Let it cook for half a min or so and then stir it all in with the noodles. Throw in your protein and bean sprouts. Keep stirring quickly and this should be done in 5 mins. Add green onions to garnish.

If you are open to something different than a nightclub, i would recommend:

- timberlounge (axe throwing bar) if you are looking for a cool group activity (you have to book the axe throwing in advance)

- live music at local bars. Check out bars like Old Triangle, Navigator or Tide and Boar in advance to find some live music. There are often good live music shows at the Tide and Boar in the ballroom, check out the tide and boar website for upcoming events.

"There's also the fact that the younger generations don't go out or drink as much as they used to. I'm in my 30s but back in school, and the difference between students now and ten years ago is insane. Most of them have to work while studying so they can't afford to drink socially.

There also isn't a lot of people past 25 years old who are single. Moncton isn't big enough to have a sustainable population of single late 20s people to patron such a club. Tinder has to have taken a bite out of the bar market in general as well. How many people went to bars and clubs just to meet someone?

"I think its really just a matter of market conditions. There is and always has been an extreme amount of risk trying to open a nightclub. You can only get revenue 2-3 days a week and that's only from around 10pm and on. The people with the actual capitol to open these spots would much rather open a brewery, wine bar, restaurant which is far more dynamic and in demand. We have very few students here and a city which is only now starting to add residents to the downtown. 

What you end up getting with clubs is this carousal of people who either don't know what they are doing, don't have the proper funding to open an actual quality club, or are extremly shady (ie: cosmo owner from many years ago). After that in order to get people into a club that is of poor quality is to lure them in with extremely cheap drinks. Its super difficult to make any profit doing this, you need tons and tons of people coming in, and then your drink prices also now bring in a crowd that people who actually have money to spend don't want anywhere near the place. They'd rather spend 9 bucks a beer or $14 for a cocktail at a tide and boar, wine bar, tire shack etc. 

I don't see this city ever getting a quality club until the downtown population grows immensely or we get a major university closer to the city and I dont blame any good entrepreneur for not opening one. Tide and Boar kind of does it right where they diversified their business, and have a space with the ballroom where they can bring in a DJ and have a ""club like"" atmosphere every once in awhile, but not rely on it to keep the bills paid.",t2_8ns49,lirette,0,1647874628.0,0,t1_i1jc496,i1jc496,False,Objective_Ad_2989,t3_tjc3uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tjc3uu/nightclub_recommendations/,Nightclub recommendations,/r/moncton/comments/tjc3uu/nightclub_recommendations/i1jc496/,4,r/moncton,0,4

\[What has likely fuelled the invented accounts is that there is actually a grave at the site.

Upham said the property once belonged to the Lutes family, among the earliest European settlers in the Moncton area.

A 16-year-old girl named Rebecca Lutes died, probably of tuberculosis, he said, and was buried there in the family plot.

So were three other family members, said Upham.

""When the Lutes family sold the property, they worried whoever bought the property was going to end up accidentally mowing over or plowing up the graves, so they put a concrete cap over it to protect the place,"" he said.

Their idea worked until recent decades, he said, when vandals damaged the gravestones.

That's the main reason Upham isn't keen on perpetuating this particular local legend.\]

"> Does anyone know if the information I'm looking for is available anywhere? Even better if you're a homebrewer who has done a water test with a kit or sent a sample for analysis.

u/biggeneral shows where in the report are the exact numbers. Kuddos to them.

I'll speak from my non-technical experience. I have a few fish aquariums, do brewing, and have a pool. A few decades ago Moncton had literally embarrasing water. We had many years of fighting with it to get it right. And we did.

A few years ago I was in Beijing in an elevator with a Chinese businessman. When he found out I was from Moncton, he told me about how he toured the Moncton Water Treatment Plant. It's no longer as famous but it still is a pretty good system.

Because of our history, our water is pretty good now. The hardness level is effectively zero for most intents. The chloride and chloramine is effectively zero for most intents. The pH is often a perfect 7.

I brew with the raw tap water without worry. I do pre-treat the water before putting it in a fish tank out of caution; however, I know people who don't. For the pool and aquariums, I have to manually make the water harder.",t2_eqxksy,dashingThroughSnow12,0,1647532061.0,0,t1_i114wij,i114wij,True,KVNDVKT0R,t3_tg9w5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tg9w5h/does_anyone_know_what_monctons_municipal_water/,Does anyone know what Moncton's municipal water profile is?

"This right here. Since you’ve got hydro hooked up, you can call NB Power, and they’ll happily give you the average bill of the previous tenant to occupy the same apartment. They’ll even give you your neighbours averages for comparison. 

Otherwise it’s a little too hard to tell based off of size. Determining factors for heating loads are: What type of equipment? (Baseboard? Hot Water? Ductless heat pumps?) The amount of insulation in the walls and type of construction. Which floor in a building you’re in (for stackable heat gains) helps- but how many are above you? How extreme of a winter it has been. Square footage is a factor, but shape and placement of heat sources change the approximation. How many windows. What condition are those windows in. Whether you’ve got other large appliances, or sleep with a hairdryer on… Are you cooking with stovetop? Or do you roast a whole turkey for 6 hours twice a week.

"Fair enough. Sorry that happened. It's definitely crossed my mind when we have gone to dog parks with her, mostly because I don't know the other dogs there and I don't have enough control over her off-leash. I find downtown to be a good place to train and hand-feed her. If there is another dog around I have plenty of time to reel her back in or head in another direction well before their noses could ever meet.

"While I am always open to suggestions on trainers and training tactics, that was not what I was asking for in this post. I felt that you suggested I am incompetent and irresponsible which I find to be rude and it hurt my feelings. I am not a professional trainer, so certain areas of weakness in my approach to training is to be expected, and I try my best to improve along with my dog. 

That said, quarantine affected many dogs in many different ways, and we have no idea the trauma that she experienced living as a stray for ~four years. She has had a broken toe, her tail appears to have been broken, and she sports a few scars that look like the result of accidents rather than attacks. (No way of knowing for sure, though.) Based of her personality, I assume she survived off begging from people, eating birds and squirrels, and being dominate towards other stray in competition with food. I don't think she benefited from fighting with other dogs because she is only about 45lbs and dogs tend to be want to be somewhat social, and want to avoid unnecessary wounds from other dogs.

I don't personally agree with Ceasar Milan's training method. That's not to say there aren't things to be drawn from him that work, but I prefer different approaches that involve only positive reinforcement and positive experiences. 

There is only so much work to be done during the winter and during quarantine. I appreciate that you value being financially prepared for a dog, as some people undervalue that responsibility. I felt like you were saying I'm not confident enough which hurt me and caught me off guard.

Putting your dog on a leash around other dogs doesn't help them socialize. It's an incredibly stressful situation for an anxious dog. Check out some epic of the 'Dog Whisperer' on youtube perhaps.

Also parking meters on main st are free after 6pm and at weekends - it’s getting lighter at nights now so that might be an option for you,t2_e7v2i,wittchimp,0,1647279236.0,0,t1_i0n3vwm,i0n3vwm,True,sweating-me,t3_te2icp,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/te2icp/cheap_parking_around_downtown_want_to_socialize/,"Cheap parking around downtown, want to socialize dog",/r/moncton/comments/te2icp/cheap_parking_around_downtown_want_to_socialize/i0n3vwm/,4,r/moncton,0,4

"Use Auto Trader. It’s like MLS for cars. Pulls from almost all dealerships. 

I had a good experience with Acura and ReCar. Acura easily gave me the best trade in, gave me a great interest rate, and a great deal. 

ReCar was 50/50. Tried to offer me 15,500 for my current car despite other dealers offering me 18k, but their inventory was awesome. 

BMW and Mercedes operated similarly. Both originally offered me less but said audition would yield more, and it did by a considerable amount. I didn’t buy a BMW or Mercedes due to not liking their lot. Both were 2nd and 3rd in trade-in offered to me. You’ll also get better interest rates with some used BMWs than other cars, and they hold value better. Just be cautious with entry level higher KM 328is. Generally good advice is to consult someone savvy on German cars before getting it. Certain models and years are well built, and others not so much. 

Most of these used car dealers are going to be the same in terms of customer service. I’ve gotten boned by Rallye, but they are not the only bad ones. Ultimately you’re buying a car, not service, so the value on your car is more important. Just don’t use their service centre.

Consider getting an independent mechanic to inspect your car prior to purchasing. Moncton Auto Kings, Midas, etc., all good options. 

Also remember you have rights as a consumer. Record the conversations you have. I was lied to about my interest rate terms on my last car at a certain dealer (not Rallye), and it wound up costing me several thousands.",t2_7l7kw2vq,ry_ta506,0,1647125323.0,0,t1_i0fb6wg,i0fb6wg,True,Broad-Remove5017,t3_tcoqaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tcoqaf/used_car_dealerships/,Used Car dealerships?,/r/moncton/comments/tcoqaf/used_car_dealerships/i0fb6wg/,2,r/moncton,0,2

"Agreed. Just hop on Realtor.ca to see how few places are available downtown. When I moved here in 2018, there were dozens of places to pick-and-choose from downtown, most of whom had been on the market for years. Now there's incredibly slim pickings.

" I lived in Montreal corner of St Laurent &  St Zotique in a 4 1/2 for $1000 (this was 2 yrs ago). Nothing fancy but renovated and clean. I was in the middle of grocery stores, restaurants, bars, 10 min bike ride to Mile End and its bars and restaurants, a 15-20 min bike ride to downtown (admittedly more like 25-30 ride home because I am not in amazing shape and it's uphill, but it was my workout for the day). More to the point, some days I would walk the 45-50 mins from my apartment to downtown because it was a pleasant walk and I could even cut through the park on the mountain for partway and enjoy the walk in the forest- I suppose I could walk 45 mins in Moncton but it's depressing, all strip malls and parking lots and not designed for pedestrians.

Rosemont is admittedly a little worse for public transit because it's not really on the metro line but my friend who lived there got downtown in a 30 mins bike ride, and there were better grocery stores and cafes walking distance than anywhere in Moncton.
I also found it a lot less scary to bike there because there is a bike culture and bike lanes, here drivers don't even expect to see a bike (on the street, going in the right direction).

People can have their preferences but it's not really an unfair comparison to compare downtown Moncton and a non downtown Montreal neighborhood because most neighborhoods in Montreal are designed to be lived in car free (restaurants, bars etc.) and have amenities that are only comparable to downtown Moncton. If you want to compare living on the Plateau or downtown Montreal- an equivalent option doesn't  really exist in Moncton.

Anyways, it's not the point of the og post, and it's ok if you prefer living here, I just really struggled a lot to find an apartment in Moncton and I feel like I am paying far too much for what it is, compared to what I had in Montreal, but maybe it's because I moved in the middle of the pandemic.",t2_4xakwo5,catparty1984,0,1647020332.0,0,t1_i09kcpx,i09kcpx,False,PhaseGrand7191,t3_t34bkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/t34bkr/moving_to_moncton_from_gatineauottawa/,Moving to Moncton from Gatineau-Ottawa,/r/moncton/comments/t34bkr/moving_to_moncton_from_gatineauottawa/i09kcpx/,1,r/moncton,0,1

"I chose to live downtown, within walking distance (about 16-20 mins) from where I work because I don't want to drive a lot. The main issues I run into are:

1) in winter the sidewalks are not shoveled and salted properly, it is slippery and hard to walk. In the summer some sidewalks are not maintained and bushes/ trees and people's garbage make it unpleasant to walk.

2) I would love to ride my bike more but the lack of bike lanes, drivers not being used to bikes makes it scary- and everyone else biking on the sidewalk or the wrong direction does not help. There should be better public education about bike rules and enforcement of them for both cyclists and drivers to keep city biking safer.

3) I would love to walk to get groceries a couple times a week but the walk is never pleasant, either to the Superstore in Dieppe or the Sobeys by Vaughan Harvey, because it was not planned for pedestrians. 
Also, while I  was used to walking to get groceries when I lived in Montreal so I don't mind carrying them, it would really help encourage people to drive less/ walk if grocery stores offered delivery- instacart is overpriced garbage that I regret using every single time, and in other provinces grocery stores have delivery services in refrigerated vans by drivers who know what they are doing. For example, in Montreal you can go to the grocery pick what you want and at the cash tell them you want delivery to your home, and then they deliver them in their van sometime that evening. (Yes they are still driving but now it's one car for a bunch of people's groceries instead of everyone driving).

There also could be more grocery options in downtown, not every store needs to be enormous.

4) There is very little choice for downtown housing, it is either overpriced condos or run down houses. There should be more medium-density housing that is not aimed at luxury condo people. 
E.g. 3-4 storey buildings, or triplexes or duplexes that  are priced somewhere between low-income housing and luxury condos.

More people would live downtown and walk if these options gradually replaced the rundown houses and empty lots (multi-storey or underground parking would easily meet parking needs- also less people would drive if they live downtown).

Right now it is too low density to be truly walkable/ have good transit. When you have too few people living in an area it is harder for businesses to survive by serving people living walking-distance to that area, and same for buses when density is too low. There are so many options for people who want a detached house to live in the suburbs and drive, downtown of a city should be at least minimum-density and walkable (including being able to walk to run errands like groceries).

This is definitely a decision city hall can make when zoning and encouraging developments of certain buildings, and is probably the most important factor in increasing people's ability to walk and live downtown.",t2_4xakwo5,catparty1984,0,1647010599.0,0,t1_i08vqpp,i08vqpp,True,AidanInFreddy,t3_tb7bc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tb7bc8/ditching_car_due_to_high_gas_prices_media_call_out/,Ditching car due to high gas prices (media call out),/r/moncton/comments/tb7bc8/ditching_car_due_to_high_gas_prices_media_call_out/i08vqpp/,7,r/moncton,0,7

"Do I like the current setup? No. Is anyone completely deserted? Not at all. Could there be better options, ABSOLUTELY!! Will there be? No.

As someone who used NB public transportation for a decade, I empathize. It's crappy now, and it was worse 20 years ago. I know some folks in this thread will hate this answer, but long distance transportation (farther than walking distance) is a **convenience** that we've become accustomed to in the past 2-3 generations, and *convenience isn't free*.

100% - It's shitty, but people want convenience without paying a price. 

* If you can afford a car and associated expenses a,d choose not have one, but still expect to transit the city in a convenient way, you'll pay for it with cabs/ride share. 
* If you can't afford a car, and can't afford cabs, you'll pay with your time.
* If you're determined not to pay at all expect to walk/bike or you can do your shopping locally or online. Every community I've been in has a local market, you don't need to shop at Sobey's - are the prices higher? Yes, that's because it's more convenient than getting to the supermarket. 
* If you want to have top tier transportation, we're all going to have to pay for it with taxes, or cuts to other services (and they're pretty lean as it is).

We all have the same shitty options to choose from but it is what it is. If I can't afford the gas for my truck, I don't drive it. It's been parked for the past few weeks because I don't want to use the gas. If I can't drive my truck, I make alternate arrangements such as having groceries delivered since the beginning of Feb so I don't have to go to the Supermarket. If I can't make it to my destination because of transportation, I don't go. If that wasn't an option, I've asked for a ride and chipped in for gas or walked (and yeah, it's been cold and shitty)

When buying a house just over a year ago my main criteria was to live somewhere that wasn't car dependent.

Unfortunately, there are not many walkable areas in the GMA, but this is a North American problem in general.

"It's been our plan for a while to make the switch to electric. My family of 3 uses our 4cyl compact car for 85% of the driving and the midsize SUV maybe once a week when more space is needed for cargo or both vehicles are needed at once (one is work from home). Unfortunately the rising cost of cars entirely cancels out what we were hoping to see in new cheaper electric cars becoming available. Basically I'm now worried their wont ever be an electric car with reasonable 350+km range for under $35k. It's still a priority of ours to not buy another gas vehicle though, it just means we'll have to save a bit more and wait a couple years for my wifes maternity leave to be over before we can afford to switch cars.  We live in a rural area too far for bike rides to daycare/work and no pubic transit so it's up to us to try and make our methods of transport more efficient however we can going forward....meanwhile half my neighbors complain about the 8c/L carbon tax while idling their Ram in the tim hortons drivethru while driving themselves to work alone and almost never hauling anything you couldn't fit in a mid size sedan.  


Regardless of carbon pricing, gas/oil is something that will always trend upwards in cost higher than inflation/wages as it is a finite resource that will only be harder and harder to find/extract as we use up existing reserves. Also less fossil fuel dependency also means less dependency on a lot of oil and gas regimes like we're seeing with Russia. Expecting people to switch quickly or without pain isn't realistic but it really is in everyones best interest to get there as quick as we can manage. It'll only get more and more painful the longer we wait, both as individuals and as a society.",t2_cfujl,Jtothe3rd,0,1646943941.0,0,t1_i05gvka,i05gvka,True,AidanInFreddy,t3_tb7bc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tb7bc8/ditching_car_due_to_high_gas_prices_media_call_out/,Ditching car due to high gas prices (media call out),/r/moncton/comments/tb7bc8/ditching_car_due_to_high_gas_prices_media_call_out/i05gvka/,3,r/moncton,0,3

"In New Brunswick, natural gas is provided in an ""unbundled market"" which means the cost of distributing natural gas is separated from the cost of supply.  This is because the retail user (YOU) pay 100% of provincial distribution costs while commercial users pay 0%.  New Brunswick is the only jurisdiction in the NA market that has retail pay total freight for all provincial gas distribution.   In the end you will be very disappointed you didn't just by the power from NB Power (who pays 0 distribution), since it is a significantly cheaper option than direct gas.  By design, it's meant to support Irving Oil and NB Power.  Every MBTU you buy supports my cheap power so please, do as others have and buy direct so my electricity bill can remain lower... kidding of course, but know that retail Nat Gas in NB is a suckers market.",t2_5j5wbmyw,razzl33,0,1646849695.0,0,t1_i002e9j,i002e9j,True,NewRiverViews,t3_ta968j,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/ta968j/natural_gas/,Natural Gas,/r/moncton/comments/ta968j/natural_gas/i002e9j/,7,r/moncton,0,7
