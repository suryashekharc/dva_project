"Texas is cheaper, for sure.  No state income tax.  But unless you live in a major metro, like Houston, there’s quite a bit of racism.  

Outside of Austin, we saw a sign that said, “We can’t guarantee the safety of colored people after dark.”  WTF?

The labor laws in Texas also favor employers, rather than the employee.  I have an uncle living in Houston.  He routinely gets laid off and he’s an electrical engineer.  We tried talking to him about moving out to California, but his wife’s family is all there.  So they just suck it up and deal.  He gets a job for 1-2 years, then they lay him off.  His whole career since moving to Texas has been like that.

My other uncle was a chemical engineer and his job was very safe in Houston.

I guess in the end, what it would come down for me is job viability.  If I was I healthcare like a doctor or something related to the oil industry, sure.  Texas would seem like a no-brainer.

If I was a software programmer, electrical engineer or a high tech bus dev person, I’d pick California.  Basically, I’d go wherever my job prospects would be concentrated because if I ever lost my job, I’d already be in an area where I could find another job like that.

Pay is relative in my opinion.  The cost of living is high in California, but there is job diversity here and a concentration of many kinds of jobs.  I’ve met many people who have switched industries out here.  

Yeah, it costs more to buy a home out here, but once you get in, the appreciation will outpace any investment you have over the long term.  Then you add Prop 13 on top of that and your property taxes don’t go from $6k a year to $18k a year, like it can in other places.",t2_47dcdqt5,NoFilterSister,0,1648271577.0,0,t1_i25scj9,i25scj9,True,Kotes_steph,t3_t7p1si,https://www.reddit.com/r/Livermore/comments/t7p1si/average_cost_of_living/,Average cost of living?,/r/Livermore/comments/t7p1si/average_cost_of_living/i25scj9/,1,r/Livermore,0,1

Blacksmith Square usually has live music on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Shops with wine/food/beer and clothing.  You can also hear it from the new Stockmen's Park if you'd rather hang out on the grass.  R Place has a big stage and usually has live music on weekend nights. They also have karaoke nights and a Jam Session night which is fun to watch.  The crowd tends to skew a bit older but very friendly vibe.

"The easiest fruit trees to grow in Livermore are figs, olives, pomegranates, loquats, feijoas, persimmons, and many types of citrus. Plums, pluots, quince, and apricots (if you get a brown rot resistant cultivar) are doable, but they need more skilled pruning. Peaches, cherries, apples and pears are difficult because of drought and disease pressure. 

All fruit trees need irrigation and fertilizer in order to thrive. Also, sunscald is a huge issue, so protect your trees by painting their trunks with diluted latex paint.

"The “word” you’re hearing is data out of Israel which has not been peer reviewed yet. Epidemiologists working on the issue have stated that those who are young, healthy, and vaccinated have excellent protection against COVID.

Take a step back from your keyboard and listen to the advice being given by medical professionals. If a booster shot is recommended in the future, let the professionals determine the dose or whether it should be one of the other vaccines available. There is data to suggest (though it’s still being vetted!) that protection is enhanced when different vaccines are combined.

Also, it looks like businesses & colleges are moving towards requiring vaccines. You can be confident that if a booster is recommended, it will be readily available by your kid’s university or municipality.

"Livermore has a really great selection of coffee shops in the downtown center, and each one has its own vibe. I highly recommend checking them all out and seeing which you prefer. 

In no particular order:  
-	Story Coffee (try their oat milk tea lattes)  
-	Panama Bay Coffee (they have a ton of coffee options, I like the Charlie Brown personally)  
-	Espresso Rosetta (try one of their “cortado truffles”)  
-	The Press Cafe (try the Orange Creamsicle Latte)  
-	The Steam House Coffee & Kava (haven’t tried this place yet but looks interesting)  
-	Wingen Bakery (also have not been yet but it’s on the list)   
-	Peet’s (not local obviously but still a nice location right downtown)  

I haven’t seen anything for open mic nights since we moved here (covid shut most of that stuff down), but there are concerts at a few of the wineries in the area on Thursday/Friday evenings.",t2_30rrts70,m_ttl_ng,0,1627337825.0,0,t1_h6n09j0,h6n09j0,True,Code_Rojo1994,t3_oen07t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Livermore/comments/oen07t/breakfastcoffee_shops/,Breakfast/Coffee Shops.,/r/Livermore/comments/oen07t/breakfastcoffee_shops/h6n09j0/,3,r/Livermore,1,3

Bluebell is busy up to Heather, but after that it is quiet.  the school there is either Croce Elementary or Christensen, with Altamont Creek available across the way; all good schools.  

The only issue I have with Springtown & North Vasco is it is treated like a satellite community when it comes to city-related issues.  Police presence is not as good as it should be when compared to the rest of the city; not to say there is high crime (there is not), but the small things that police should be enforcing are not taken care of as well as they are in other parts of the city.  Similarly, where the city looks to preserve their downtown core and get all uppity around high density housing, there seems to be no problem flooding the Vasco road area with similar housing.

Some are better than others. Both High Schools are fine. There are just a couple Elementary Schools and Middle Schools here and there that lag behind the rest a little bit.

There are a couple schools that offer open enrollment that are good quality so even if you're in an area where you're not a fan of the schools you may or may not be able to open enroll in a different school entirely. 

>Is Livermore safe/ any areas to avoid? 

https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/livermore/crime

https://lmpd.crimegraphics.com/2013/default.aspx

Overall I think it is pretty safe. 

For reference, I grew up in San Ramon, lived in San Jose for several years, lived in Dublin for a couple of years, and lived in Pleasanton for about a year, before moving to Livermore about 4 years ago. 

Definitely safer than San Jose. Comparable to San Ramon, Pleasanton, and Dublin.

> How is your commute to the South Bay?

Livermore is decent. About the same as commuting from San Ramon, Dublin, or Pleasanton. Maybe a little longer of a commute depending on where in Livermore you are, but being able to take 84 to 680 is a plus.

My only response to the Brentwood vs. Livermore is the commute.  Yeeesh, that part of Vasco that goes from Brentwood to Livermore, I believe you'd have to take to get to the South Bay, I know people do it, but what a nightmare.  It also has lots of safety issues.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco\_Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_Road)

I'd suggest before moving you do both commutes and see for yourself, it's how I made my decision.  Yes, Livermore is more expensive but quality of life does matter.  That part of Vasco out of Brentwood was never meant for the type of traffic that goes through it.

&#x200B;

I just moved to Livermore from San Ramon and I've been pleasantly surprised.  A few things that I didn't expect:

1. Livermore Wine Valley  - Very nice for walks, runs.  Nice parks in this area.  And of course, wine.
2. Biking - The biking is awesome if you're into that.
3. Charming Shops - More personality than San Ramon, in my view.
4. Farmers Markets - I like the Sunday Morning, Thursday Evening weekly farmer's market, pretty cool.
5. Access to Tri-Valley - You're only 15 mins from Dublin, Pleasanton, 20 from San Ramon, so lots of flexibility built-in to the other cities.  So in a way you get to enjoy what's cool about these other cities fairly easily.

(Seriously, though, for the last seven years or so, you might have seen me, often with my bright yellow DR650, educating riders on oil and filter recycling and handing out free oil change gear at events that ranged from the International Motorcycle Show back when it was at the San Mateo Convention Center to the EasyRiders show in Sac to track days at Sears Point/ Sonoma Raceway to Cycle Gear Bike Nights to events at Harley, Indian, Honda, and KTM dealerships, to Poker Runs,  to Flat track races at Cal Expo, to Visitor events at Carnegie , Metcalf, and Hollister Hills OHV parks, to  pop-ups up on Skyline, at Alice's Restaurant, and on Redwood/ Pinehurst, and to classes at Scuderia, Werkstatt, Piston &Chain, Moto Guild and Chabot City College...  )

Covid made in person outreach a lot more difficult, and this is one of the ways we are trying to keep getting the word out!

"On a Tuesday night, it's unlikely you'll find anywhere that has music or dancing. There's no market for that on a weekday here, so places are either closed or are a restaurant on weekday nights. Sauced or Ale House are probably going to be your best places to get food and stay late for a drink. Sauced closes at 10 tomorrow and serves drinks. Ale House has only beer or wine, and they're open until 9 tomorrow. Across the street from Sauced are some restaurants/bars that have changed names a few times and I don't remember what they're called. They have nice outdoor seating next to fire places, but it's supposed to be cold tomorrow, so probably not a great idea. Beer Baron is also an option.

Regardless, downtown is going to be your best bet. Everything is walking distance. Free parking. Fantastic food and many choices. BBQ, American, Chinese, Sushi, Italian, Mexican, Afghan, Thai.

"I was actually looking at a single family home for sale in 2013 on N Street that was listed for 150k.  It was totally gutted, but for that price, I thought it was well worth it to at least do a drive by (the Zillow photos showed kitchen cabinets and fixtures all ripped out, pissed off renters or meth heads?)

When I got there, I parked in front of the house, but across the street.  Started to take out my phone to take photos and 3 cop cars arrived and started to arrest a guy a couple houses down.  I was still taking photos of the house and a cop came up to me and asked me what I was doing.  I told him.  He said, “You’re on the wrong side of downtown.  You want the other side.”

I think the area has gotten better, though.  Honestly, I would probably live there.  I’ve lived in worst parts of San Jose before moving out this way.

As for train tracks, you might just get used to it.  I looked at one home next to the train tracks in Pleasanton, parallel to Big Stanley.  It was weird.  I’d never seen 3 sets of dual-pane windows in order to mask sound.  I did end up buying another place about 300-400 feet away from the train tracks and other than the first week or two, we never noticed the ace train after that.",t2_47dcdqt5,NoFilterSister,0,1622623794.0,0,t1_h0akdvb,h0akdvb,True,mightyfenrir88,t3_nngfu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Livermore/comments/nngfu6/looking_to_buy_a_home_in_chestnut_street_livermore/,Looking to buy a home in chestnut street Livermore,/r/Livermore/comments/nngfu6/looking_to_buy_a_home_in_chestnut_street_livermore/h0akdvb/,2,r/Livermore,0,2

"  
Downtown Livermore has a 13-screen movie theater, a $22 million performing arts center, an ACE train station and pleasant, flat streets lined with shade trees, trellises, fine restaurants, boutiques and wine tasting rooms.  
But unlike other Bay Area downtowns that have been successfully revived in recent years, central Livermore lacks the ingredient widely seen as key to vitality: new housing.  
Now that is starting to change — and not everybody is happy about it.  
While construction is well under way on the Legacy Livermore, a 222-unit luxury complex at a former downtown car dealership, a proposed 100% affordable development next door to that project has divided the city, leading to accusations of racism and raising questions about what kind of city Livermore wants to be and who gets to live there.  
At the center of the fight is a 130-unit affordable project proposed for a flat dirt 2.5-acre parcel fronting Veterans Park, near the southeast corner of Railroad Avenue and L Street. The city-owned lot has been designated for affordable housing since 2007. The developer, Eden Housing, was selected in 2018 and has received $14.4 million in bond funding from Alameda County for the project.  
On Tuesday the Livermore City Council is slated to vote on the project. While the Planning Commission supported it 4-1 in April, the deliberations made headlines when Commissioner John Stein suggested that it would turn the neighborhood into a “ghetto.”  
“I really don’t want to see the downtown become a ghetto of affordable housing,” he said at the April 20 hearing. “I think it should be distributed throughout the city and if we see high-density housing downtown, it should be market rate with maybe 20% affordable rather than entirely affordable.”  
While Stein later apologized for the comment, Eden Housing President Linda Mandolini said the comments were “shortsighted” and “really disappointing.”  
  
“Affordable housing has come so far and Eden has been working in Livermore for more than two decades,” she said. “It was unbelievable — we were all staring it at our screen saying, ‘Did he really say that?’”  
At the eastern edge of the Bay Area, across the Altamont Pass from the Central Valley, Livermore straddles two worlds. It retains a strong agricultural character, with more than 50 wineries and working ranches. The city is also home to the Livermore Stockmen’s Rodeo Association, which claims to be “the world’s fastest rodeo.” The downtown Stockmen’s Park, which lies next to where the Eden project would go, has the cattle brand marks of prominent Livermore ranchers etched in concrete.  
Yet it’s also an expensive Bay Area bedroom community, with a burgeoning restaurant and wine scene that draws local tourists. As home to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, it has long had a strong community of scientists. The city is diverse — about 20% Latino, 10% Asian, and it is home to Shiva-Vishnu Temple, the largest Hindu temple in California.  
Mandolini said that the need for affordable housing in the Tri-Valley area has soared in recent years. Homes in the city now average more than $1 million and have increased 27% since the start of the pandemic, according to Redfin. Livermore has 120 homeless children in its school district and the Eden project has 13,000 Alameda County families on its waiting list, Mandolini said. Forced out by rising rents and home prices many Livermore workers live in Stockton or Tracy and commute over the Altamont Pass.  
“There is a three-year wait for anything in the Tri-Valley area,” she said. “It’s not like you can build workforce housing out by the wineries. If we don’t build it here, where is it going to go?”  
Opposition to the project is led by Joan Seppala, who owns the Livermore Independent newspaper. Her group, Save Livermore Downtown, has spent upwards of $2 million to turn public opinion against the development.  
The group fighting the project says the development would increase traffic and that the income requirements are too low to allow public servants — such as teachers, firefighters and police officers — to qualify. It would “harm the open feeling of Livermore’s historic downtown,” they say.  
Ruth Gasten, spokesperson for Save Livermore Downtown, said “Livermore residents are clearly upset with the current plan.” She argues the city should move the affordable housing north of Railroad Avenue, allowing the lot slated for the Eden project to be a “beautiful central park.” The alternate site could accommodate 230 affordable units rather than 130, the group said. They would also like to see it target more moderate income families who earn too much to qualify under the current plan.  
“We strongly believe, because there will be more affordable housing if it is moved slightly north, that all current funding will be retained,” Gasten said. “This is just one option. There may be others. Where there’s a will, there’s a way, and the will of the voters of Livermore is for the City Council to seek those alternatives immediately.”  
  
Former Livermore Mayor John Marchand, who served from 2011 to last year, said that the opponents seem to have a double standard: They didn’t oppose the market-rate Legacy project but are against the Eden plan.  
“The people who will live there are the people who serve you your food and teach your children,” Marchand said.  
  
Marchand characterized the opponents as “a small group of wealthy elite.” Moving the project across the street would likely delay the production of affordable housing by at least five years and likely kill it altogether.  
“There is no alternative plan,” said Marchand. “That is a fantasy. There is no financing, no traffic analysis, no public input. They don’t own the land and it’s not for sale. There is a drawing. That is it.”  
He said some public servants would qualify. The units would be reserved for people and families earning less than 60% of Alameda County’s area median income — that means to be eligible a single person could earn no more than $54,840, while a four-person family could earn no more than $104,400, according to the county.  
For some context, a fully credentialed Livermore Valley Unified School District teacher with about five years experience but no graduate degree earns between $54,000 and $68,000.  
Adam Van de Water, who heads up Livermore’s Office of Innovation and Economic Development, said there are now 93,500 average daily commuters on the Altamont Pass headed to the Bay Area from San Joaquin County. New residents buying in Livermore’s new gated communities are increasingly high-income tech or finance workers who commute into San Francisco or Silicon Valley. Meanwhile the waiters, carpenters, clerks and warehouse workers who earn a Livermore paycheck are commuting from Tracy, Lathrop or Stockton.  
Even employers with traditionally well-compensated positions like those at the labs are working on relocations of new employees to homes in the Central Valley, he said.  
“People always ask why it takes so long and costs so much to build affordable housing,” said Daniela Ogden, a vice president with Eden. “This is a pretty good example of why. We have to turn people away every day and the cost of living is only going up.”",t2_4bsqy,masteroffm,0,1622044395.0,0,t1_gzizhtl,gzizhtl,False,BurntMyHotPocket,t3_nliwto,https://www.reddit.com/r/Livermore/comments/nliwto/plan_for_affordable_downtown_housing_divides_bay/,"Plan for affordable downtown housing divides Bay Area city, with claims of racism, elitism",/r/Livermore/comments/nliwto/plan_for_affordable_downtown_housing_divides_bay/gzizhtl/,18,r/Livermore,0,18

Great advice here. I’d add that it would depend on your work hours and how often you go in. If you have flexibility. Maybe a four day week or can leave early (before 3 or 4) then it’s doable.

"This might be a wrong time for you to experience SF city life.  

About 2 years ago, I was working SF while living in Livermore.  Took about 1hr-2+hr to get to my office from my house (drive+bart+walk) and 1hr-2+hrs coming back to Livermore..

Getting onto Bart early in the morning is a treat with all the homeless from Trivalley ridding with you to work.  I think Livermore is the only homeless shelter in the area.  The smell is unbearable.  Some of them are also crazy and you might question your safety.  Police are useless, they just herd them from one train to another.  

Once at Civic Center Bart station, you get to see druggies lying on the floors  shooting up.  We are not talking about in some dark corner.  We are talking about right on the entries.

Walking up the escalator, you see drug dealers doing their stuffs.  They are normally gone by 8am when the police shows up for their round.  

As I walk to my office, the streets are filled with feces, urine stains and smell, syringes, and homeless people...this is Market street I am talking about. 

One time, I called the cops because there was a homeless guy walking around with a samurai sword.  By the time the cops shows up, he was already 8 blocks passed where I first saw him.  Waving his sword around.  

People are leaving SF for many reasons beside the expensive housing.  

Almost forget that Pre-Pandemic Bart is so over crowded that you are packed in like sardines for your 1hr ride.

"I did this for years.  I lived in SF and commuted out to Livermore before changing jobs.

The key to making this work is all about where you live in San Francisco.  Once you hit the freeway in SF, it’s about a 50 minute commute.  However, it can take anywhere from 5 min to 45 min to get to that freeway within San Francisco.  I chose to settle in the Mission District, as it had quick access to freeway via the Duboce/Van Ness ramp to 101.  The only time you run into trouble is if there is an accident or if there’s an evening baseball game on the way home.  I used to have the ballgame schedule taped to my desk and those days I would leave early or work from home.

If you’re near the Mission, you have access to BART as well.  I used to BART out to the Dublin/Pleasanton station and then drive to Livermore with a car I left parked out at the BART station.  There used to be a time when it was free to leave cars overnight, however that’s not an option without a monthly permit now, I believe.  With a car parked at the station, my total commute time was 90 min.  However, 45 min of it was time I could actually work, so the total time lost to the commute was about the same.

Mass transit from the BART station is slow with many stops.  The shuttle that my company offered came way too early for me.  Thus, if I were to take mass transit the whole way, it was 120 min end to end.

Since I used to commute the bridge toll and BART have more than doubled plus there are parking fees as I said.  I highly recommend the experience of living in the City, however you need to do you homework on location and total cost of living with gas, tolls, parking, and rent to make sure you aren’t squeezed financially or crushed by a painful commute.

"We breed and sell rodents for use in laboratory testing.  If you came to work for us, 80% of your workload would be transferring animals from dirty cages to clean ones, then scraping the soiled bedding from the old cage so the cage can be washed.  No degree or previous experience required.  You would need to pass a pretty thorough background check (they look for ties to extremist animal rights groups like PETA or the Animal Liberation Front).

And since I like to be upfront with people, I'll also let you know: one of the biggest concerns the company has is biosecurity.  Since most of our animals are sold for use in medical research, our customers need to be absolutely confident that the animals we send them are completely healthy.  This means security measures significantly more extreme than you'd see at most other jobs.  To enter the barrier each day, I have to completely strip down and pass through a locking, timed shower (the company, of course, provides secure lockers for our belongings).  I then dress in company-provided, sterilized clothing.  We can bring absolutely NOTHING through the showers with us except for prescription eyewear or hearing aids.  And when I say nothing, I mean nothing: we can't wear necklaces, earrings, or even wedding rings.  If you need medication, it has to be approved by management and sent in through a chemical decon port.  Being caught bringing any unauthorized item through the showers will result in immediate firing, no warnings, no second chances.  You will also be asked about any pets that you have, and if you have pet rodents or some types of reptiles you will not be hired.  This all seems pretty crazy from the outside, but if any kind of disease or parasite were to get into our stock, it would be absolutely catastrophic; we would have to euthanize any infected or potentially exposed animals, and possibly even completely scrap entire breeding colonies and rebuild them from scratch, a process that would take close to a year to get them back up to full production.

Now, that's if you get hired to work in the barrier!  We have a second area in the building across the parking lot; this section is called the isolator.  The isolator is where we keep our immunocompromised strains.  Because they have suppressed immune systems, they are kept in essentially ""bubble boy"" style sealed compartments, and the technicians care for them by reaching through glove ports.  Because the animals in this section are isolated from the technicians, the showers and other major biosecurity measures are not required.

Starting pay is $18.00 an hour.  All positions are full-time.  If you apply and are hired to work inside the barrier, you will have to remain inside the barrier for lunch, so food is provided and your lunch period is paid.

"I don't think we have anything at that level, unfortunately. At least not comparable to the facility you linked. 

For general simulator usage, the best bet is down at the PGA Superstore in East Palo Alto, which is ~40 miles away. For lessons or more direct training there's Norcal Golf Academy up in Walnut Creek, or Golftec in Pleasanton. 

Your best bet for training is probably just heading to one of the local public courses for their range and practice greens, which I have to say the Tri-valley area has a ridiculous number of golf courses within ~30 minutes drive. 

My personal favorite is Poppy Ridge if you go that route; they have a fully grass driving range, right next to chipping and putting greens. If you're driving over ~280 yards the range is a bit short, but it's a solid course that's only ~12 minutes from downtown. 

But yeah there's just a ton of courses from Pleasanton up through Walnut Creek, which are all within your 25 mile range and are public courses so you can just go putt or practice without worrying about it.

"It’s not a bad idea but I think the biggest issue is where is that location? Nobody wants to have a dedicated site for drug use in their neighborhood, the city shouldn’t want to have that in the newly renovated downtown core if they are pushing tourism, and the homeless/transient population doesn’t want to be too far removed from stores/businesses.

If there is a care center built, that level of mental/addiction healthcare is expensive to maintain. And it also requires commitment from the people themselves to show up and actually use the resources. Security is also a concern as well in that case. 

Another approach would be some sort of distributed care system with safe injection sites or beds around the city to avoid lumping everyone together, but again that would be expensive and difficult to maintain. But it hopefully would allow more personal care overall.
