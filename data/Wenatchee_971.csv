Having dealt with LocalTel before, the $160 fee is the PUD fee, not LocalTel.  You pay LocalTel who in turns pays that to the PUD.  That fee is really cheap for a crew to come out with a boom truck, splice fiber, install hardware and run overhead cable to your house.  $160 is the fee you pay when the fiber is in your area.

If you don't even have fiber in the area, getting it can cost way more.

"What about Pokemon Go? I think the in-person stuff has died down to a large extent, but there should still be \*some\* in-person activity. PM me for the Discord link. If nothing else, we can meet up and I can explain the game (if you don't know it already.)  


I don't have a lot of experience with gaming groups in the area; my work schedule makes it hard to attend meetups at game stores. What I've heard, though:  


Sanctuary is a game store near the college, I think focusing largely on Magic: The Gathering. I don't have a lot of personal experience, but I've heard the pricing is a little high. Cave Collectable Gaming is near Fred Meyer, and focuses on Warhammer. The proprietor seems extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the game. Finally, Epoch Games is hoping to open soon, with a ton of different options (virtual and physical games.) They'll be on the Ave, and you can sign up for their newsletter: [https://epochgamelounge.com/](https://epochgamelounge.com/)

"Hi! I don’t have a lot of input about moving or not, but I wanted to mention something that’s been helpful for me. A lot of my friends live on the west side, and also don’t have kids. We are in our 30’s but a lot of our friends have chosen not to have kids. I have an almost 4 year old and an almost 6 month old and I’m now staying home with both since having the baby. We’ve been putting our son in swim classes and gymnastics and that has helped tremendously! I know you mentioned a music class, but that may not be conducive to talking since there is music being played and I think the parent is helping the child in those kinds of classes, at least at the one I know of. In swimming or gymnastics, they are being taught by the teacher, leaving your wife room to talk with other parents. I know you said that she is much more introverted, but other moms  might be more extroverted, and may just get her talking!  I’m pretty outgoing and try to talk to every parent there. I have made a few mom friends just by doing some play dates and that’s been really nice for us because our kids can have fun and we have someone who is in our same stage of life to talk to.

"I think this is one area I can try harder to support her in.

We have very different interests but somehow it works. She is into crafts, decorating/designing, reading etc, but it's been a while since we've done something together which isn't helping I'm sure.

"Hi there! Sorry to hear about the added pressure to make a decision now. Is this supposed to be a time-sensitive decision? I’m assuming so based on the job offer. 

Although I don’t live in Wenatchee anymore (parents still do), it sounds like a lot of the stress may stem from the lack of support network in the Wenatchee Valley. Have you reached out to your medical provider about resources you and your wife can use to connect with other families living in Wenatchee? Or free/affordable services that offer support? I know the YMCA has some parent-child programs you can attend if you’re feeling like you want to make more connections with parents in the area. 

In Ellensburg, our hospital has the “Fourth Trimester” resource center where we can come in and ask if there are any services in our town we can use to help parents lighten our load. They also host fun parental get-togethers. 

Moving closer to family can be a pro for now due to the necessary support, but as you all gather a rhythm and the children get older, would you still appreciate living closer to family or would you start feeling like boundaries would be pushed?

Although you may feel like this decision depends solely on you, I think you and your partner should talk more about the long term pros and cons and go over solutions to ensure you’re not feeling salty and she’s still feeling supported.

"I think that Biden made a huge mistake a few months ago when he declared that US military involvement was off the table in Ukraine, as he basically invited Russia to invade with no consequences other than sanctions. Before that declaration it was unclear if the US would help Ukraine if Russia invaded, and if that ambiguity had remained then Putin probably wouldn’t have risked an invasion. If I were in charge I would immediately threaten to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine if Putin does not commit to a cease-fire and withdrawal. I’m not saying we should go in guns blazing right now and start WWIII, but I think we need to at least put a no-fly zone on the table so we have some leverage and so we give Russia ample warning in case we decide it’s necessary to intervene in the near future. We can’t just let Putin take over the world without a fight by threatening to use nukes. I voted for Biden but I think he is being way too weak right now.

So yeah, if Omicron is declining faster than originally thought, lift the mask requirements earlier. That’s how science works. — imagine if they’d said masks could come off in February then it turned out the hospital capacity was still high, people would complain if the requirement was extended. It’s the same thing we did last summer, removed the masks when transmission was low.

"Complaining about building more apartments because rents are high is like slapping yourself in the face and complaining it hurts.

More units means more competition to keep them full means lower prices. More rental units is a good thing even if they are only building units intending them to be on the spendy side. You should be behind any apartment constructions.

Well almost any. I'm sure there are some reasons not to support apartments going in. Also I do believe the city not supporting affordable housing constructions is doing the people of this town a disservice. Especially since they seem to be doing so on purpose.

You’re kidding about the cultural diversity right? Maybe if you’re coming from a tiny farm town but otherwise wenatchee is just a tiny ex-farm city. Which means the most diversity it has are the families of migrant seasonal workers that decided to stick around (Latinos) and the folks that have moved from the west side and are now gentrifying the valley. Sure there are a handful of “ethnic” restaurants but outside of a few Native American events and quinceañeras around there is not much more diversity than any other small city in eastern Washington. Really the biggest reason to move to Wenatchee is if you love the outdoors because you’re access to recreation in all seasons is hard to beat.,t2_bl98f068,cinammonbear,0,1645809822.0,0,t1_hyejw56,hyejw56,True,[deleted],t3_t011vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wenatchee/comments/t011vk/possibly_moving_to_wenatchee_it_looks_so/,Possibly moving to Wenatchee.

"Regarding times to get places, it really depends on where you live. I lived in West Wenatchee close to Western Ave when I was in my 20s. I had a friend who lived maybe 2-3 blocks south of where Costco is now. It took me 20 minutes to drive from my place to my friends place. I think the route hasn't really changed except for there being a little more traffic because of the Costco, but there is the bypass from the bridge east of Fred Meyer, and the only place I could get to Highline Drive was via Grant Road.

"IMO, we have too many Mexican restaurants, but I think that also reflects the amount of Hispanic folk we have in town. I think Wenatchee is a reflection of a town with a long-time small town attitude that got bigger faster than what was expected. More people, from more metropolitan areas expect better restaurants. Wenatchee is still playing catch-up. I think you are being awfully picky for a town less than 5% the size of Seattle.

I was born here in 1966, and in the 70s and 80s, most of restaurants were chains and pizza joints and family-style restaurants. There were a few outstanding places, but most of them never lasted for too long. (I never thought the Chieftain and the  Cottage Inn would go away, but they did).

"It is beautiful. As far as “culturally enriched”, I’m not so sure. It has an active arts scene, I know that. I don’t ever hear much about music, no one talking about shows, handbills, nothing like that, but may there is? 

I’ve noticed that there isn’t much diversity here, other than Hispanic and white. It’s kind of surreal to me to have so few encounters with anyone outside the big two, and I really don’t know why we don’t have more diversity here, I think it would be great for the community. Although ever so slowly, I’m starting to see more Black and Asian people, but those encounters are still infrequent.

The food scene is pretty limited, Mexican/burgers, etc. primarily with very little other than that, and quality varies. The standouts really stand out.

For it’s limitations, it is still an amazing place to live. People are friendly, down to earth, none of the coldness so common to the big city.

"The whole valley is fairly compact. There's not really a distinction of neighborhoods when it comes to the culture compared to large metro areas. For the most part, you're never really farther than 30-40 minutes from any one place in the valley and many people live on one side of the river while working on the other. The biggest difference between Wenatchee and East Wenatchee is that the east side is less developed and a bit more rural. If you're looking to find someplace quiet to live that's your better bet. Wenatchee is more urban, in comparison, but don't expect it to be anything like a true urban center. The buses run from 5:30 am to 9 pm and most places close by 10 pm or earlier except for the handful of bars. There is definitely a culture in the area but it's fairly season based. And the pace is not what one would call speedy. My mother, who's lived in the valley for the better part of 40 years complains about how getting from the south end of town where she lives, to the north end now takes closer to 25 minutes when it used to only take 15. And the politics are not progressive by any stretch of the imagination, if that's something that matters to you. But it is a beautiful place to live and if you love the outdoors there's no better place to live as far as I'm concerned. There is an arts and literary scene, which is small but no less passionate for it's size. There is good food and drink and a strong sense of community. There has been several music scenes over the last 3 decades, the latest one being in the late 2000s and early 2010s. From what I hear from friends and read in the local paper, it seems that there's the possible beginnings of another revival. Especially for the punk/metal scene at Wally's house of booze. There's also a lot of religion in the valley. Most people aren't too overbearing about it but a few of the churches are a bit pushy. And there's the giant cross on the Wenatchee heights which is lit up most nights on the south end of town. Some people find it disagreeable but knowing the story from my mother that a gentleman put it up as a memorial for his own mother when she passed away I, personally, don't find it offensive. But to each their own. I was born and raised in Wenatchee for the first 23 years of my life and having lived away for nearly 9 years, I haven't found a place that compares to it.

"The best way to picture it in my head is East Wenatchee is where most brand name stores are. There's a mall, olive garden, Costco ect.. 

(West) Wenatchee is where the downtown is. There are more mom and pop shops (with the exception of walmart/home depot) and recreational parks. 

In terms of living.. I would personally say Wenatchee is ""more"" beautiful but they are so close together, it is hardly an argument to make.

The reality is, it takes maybe 4-5 minutes to go from Wenatchee - East wenatchee.. it is nice because it is a small city (All of Chelan County is under 80,000 people) but with many of the amenities of a mid size city of 100,000 people.

"Washington does have ""battery"", just assault.  Assault is defined as:

1. An intentional, “unlawful touching” that is harmful or offensive;   
2. An attempt, with unlawful force, to inflict bodily injury upon another person; or   
3. The act of putting another person in apprehension of harm, whether or not the actor actually intends to inflict that harm.    

There are 4 degrees of assault, depending on the actual nature and severity of the act, which can result in anything from a misdemeanor to a class A felony.

Micah Vacatio recently opened a private practice specializing in LGBTQIA folx. Amazing therapist, though I am unsure of the location of their current practice. I'd venture to say Micah is the valley's LGBTQIA leading expert.

Additional therapists who are affirming: Grant Mundell in the pediatrics department, Lauren Wiggum and Robin Lee.

 OP didn't ask, but Valerie Wintler is an affirming PCP if needed!

With the exception of Micah, all of these providers are through Confluence. We have a conservative area but there are some little pockets of hope there.

I was under the impression that we were the same age. It’s so sickening to read that he was abusing other girls during that time. 

It doesn’t surprise me at all that an org like Grace City would employ and welcome into their community people like him.

That said, The dismissive nature of using and vilifying ivermectin is absolutely bonkers.

While I personally am fully vaccinated, and contracted Covid 19 anyway (hooray natural immunity), I think we owe it to our fellow humans to be open to *all* possible options for fighting and preventing this virus, and quit being so entirely shortsighted and dismiss legitimate or potentially legitimate alternatives.

It’s not a right vs left issue, but y’all are making it one.
