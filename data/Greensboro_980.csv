"You're welcome and I hope UHG works out for you. They use the STAR interview system, I'd recommend doing some planning (I sucked). Alorica is a local call center. They do all kinds of campaigns: customer service, tech, billing, etc. They provide equipment and start at $15.00. If you're up for it, check out the major insurance companies like Progressive. I know more than a few are hiring as well.

ETA.

"Oh goodness, I'm starting to see more alumni, not current parents, share this on Grimsley Alumni Facebook groups. It's also being pushed pretty hard by the ""Take Back Our Schools"" group. 

This feels very contrived, like they need something to be upset about.

There were no rallies to save the pool that was demolished and displaced the swim team. There were no rallies to save the softball field when they demolished it initially to build a new track. 

A middle school can't fit on a site that was already too small for an elementary school. The other option of building Kiser next to the current Kiser site will disrupt Kiser's student learning and traffic patterns/parking, which are already terrible. 

Not to mention, their beef continues to be with Deborah Napper, who they politically disagree with. Pat Tillman is the representative on the board for Kiser who has responded and is in favor of using the fields since it's least disruptive to everyday activities at both schools. They generally agree with Pat politically though, so no huge airing of grievances with him on those Facebook posts.",t2_edkro,books4all,0,1648270831.0,0,t1_i25r9tn,i25r9tn,True,mobleygso,t3_tkxfaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/tkxfaz/greensboro_parents_concerned_about_plans_for/,Greensboro parents concerned about plans for athletic fields,/r/gso/comments/tkxfaz/greensboro_parents_concerned_about_plans_for/i25r9tn/,1,r/gso,0,1

"Lol that’s funny. I originally was using my English degree to teach high school, but with how the school system has changed so drastically since I graduated HS in 2018, I lost my passion for it.

Good food right there too - LPFS, Sticks and Stones, Emma Key's.

Those areas are located in what they are now call midtown. That area has exploded with restaurants, bars, etc. And the “rail trail” greenway runs right through it.

"South end is right across the street from boxcar, it has a fun atmosphere but no games or anything like that. 

Pig pounders is a cool spot, you can bring food from wherever and go sit at a bar/outside/inside and they have ping pong and jenga and some stuff like that. 

Most breweries and the like will have something for you to do (if you enjoy that scene) live music etc. 

Grasshopper games are really fun, there isn’t much of a social aspect like a bar but obviously there are a bunch of people around so you can try to chat it up or whatever. 

You could go bowling or hiking around a trail at lake Brandt or wherever. Again maybe not as socially targeted but they’re things you can do with/around other people to potentially make friends.

I also don’t know any specific places in Greensboro but if you’re into it you could look up places to join like a board game group or play DnD or something.

It’s an old town, and utilities, unless they are completely overhauled occasionally, tend to get more and more complicated as they age and require small repairs; so it makes sense why there would be so many manhole covers and road patches, especially in the areas of town which are the oldest, like the ones I’ve mentioned.",t2_2pslrhqj,cdoublesaboutit,0,1648149298.0,0,t1_i1yveie,i1yveie,False,cdoublesaboutit,t3_tm6vpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/tm6vpg/is_it_just_me_or_are_our_roads_in_dismal_shape/,"Is it just me, or are our roads in dismal shape?",/r/gso/comments/tm6vpg/is_it_just_me_or_are_our_roads_in_dismal_shape/i1yveie/,1,r/gso,0,1

"I've lived here for a few years.... since mid-2015. I come from a place where the garbage is cleaned up by community service every week (so, it's effectively litter-free), sidewalks are ubiquitous, and the pot holes are cleared up.... Taxes pay for all of these services.

I don't know how bad our roads are on a national level..... but the litter is atrocious, IMO.... My poor car has to decide whether to run over a McDonald's Big Mac wrapper or a cardboard box. I *hate* pulling into a parking spot only to see it taken by someone's discarded Hardee's drink... I just want more sidewalks since I hate having to walk alongside the streets (or in the littered grass) just to get places. I will gladly help pay for them....

I remember when I initially moved to Greensboro, I was pleasantly surprised at how soon potholes were filled up. Nowadays, they can seem hit or miss. But I think they're cared for, mostly.

I do hate the skinny speed bumps, though. I swear, they ruined my muffler. Back in the city I moved from (Columbus, OH), the speed bumps are much wider/gradual and easier on cars. They still slow you down!

I think the road pavement here generally seems like good quality .... nice and smooth, usually... I am not knowledgable enough to judge the quality of tar or asphalt. :)

"Sorry, just saw this, I hope it's not too late......I had one done, a front tooth 5 years ago. My initial consult was with Lane and Associates on West Friendly. I felt rushed and coerced into a ""hurry up and get this done!"" atmosphere. Really a hard sell. I asked my dentist and found out that 3 employees from her office went to this guy: James Tanner. A much better experience, he did a fantastic job for about $600 less than the other group. I liked his whole approach of what to do better, too (temporary crown, not a flipper type of thing). I felt very confident in his abilities. Bonus points for the fact that he trained my dentist how to do crowns, so she was extra careful and precise since she knew he would be looking at her work, lol. I know he lists as a periodontist, but he does implants, too (or he did, 5 years ago!).

"Yes, I came across too harsh. I just have no patience for special interest obstructionists. 

This person is perpetuating this controversy. 

They have presented in front of the board of education, created social media posts around this issue to create hype, and somehow got their board of education speech posted on Facebook groups and a conservative YouTube channel. (Maybe they have an interest in running for office in the future?) Despite working and living in Raleigh, they still want a say as to what happens to children here.

I came across harshly, but I'm just trying to advocate for children and teachers in the community who attend and work at these broken down schools, the same ones I attended decades ago. We've lost teachers to cancer from the asbestos in Grimsley's main building, yet so many improvements have gone to the athletic facilities by comparison. 

Any plan that doesn't include using the baseball and softball fields, at least in part, will cost our community millions of additional funds and a delay in capital improvements. We have 70,000 students across the district with probably about 80% of them directly benefiting from this bond. There are maybe 80 students whose extracurricular activities might be impacted by the demolition of these fields. 

They'll still have teams, but will have to practice and play off campus, just like the swim team when the county didn't upgrade Grimsley's pool and instead demolished the building. The softball field had already been moved once recently from its original location which is now home to a new track.",t2_edkro,books4all,0,1647874478.0,0,t1_i1jbrb9,i1jbrb9,False,mobleygso,t3_tgk8a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/tgk8a4/this_is_the_worst_that_we_have_seen_grimsley_high/,‘This is the worst that we have seen’; Grimsley High School tour highlights need for repairs,/r/gso/comments/tgk8a4/this_is_the_worst_that_we_have_seen_grimsley_high/i1jbrb9/,1,r/gso,0,1

"Because traffic through an area like downtown is relatively predictable, relatively high, and speed limits are low - so lights are going to cycle relatively frequently no matter what, a sensor just doesn't provide a lot of value in those conditions.

Sensors are originally more for a situation like a low traffic side road turning onto a divided highway. You don't want to have to periodically stop the highway just because a car might be there and it's been a while, so the sensor is much more beneficial.

As costs have come down they've moved into more intersections that are in the grey area between these scenarios, but that wouldn't have applied to the downtown lights due to age - and since again there's not a lot of benefit they're unlikely to be retrofitted due to cost. Even if they were, you can't just have the sensors running the show during normal/heavy traffic, light changes would be far too frequent/inefficient. Once saturated the timing limits for the sensors are hit and it'd fall back into a similar schedule it has now. This means really the sensors are mostly only beneficial during low traffic/nighttime - so even less motivation to justify funding, which usually goes towards solving congestion/hotspots.",t2_f4ytr8w,Ben2018,0,1647865365.0,0,t1_i1iswhe,i1iswhe,True,RadioRough,t3_tijzpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/tijzpa/traffic_lights/,Traffic Lights,/r/gso/comments/tijzpa/traffic_lights/i1iswhe/,2,r/gso,0,2

"Absolutely. People complain about traffic here, and yes, wendover sucks most of the time, 40 will get busy around rush hour, I avoid death valley at certain times, but I literally refuse to drive on I-77 in Charlotte because of how dangerous and literally insane everyone is on it. I will take a different route through whatever crowded roads go directly through downtown rather than put up with that mess. Taking providence road into the city at anytime other than 10pm, yea, that's a mess too, although it always moves. Anywhere in any of the Charlotte sprawl is just busy constantly. Greensboro really has nothing on Charlotte for traffic and I am SO thankful. Maybe in another twenty years, but like you said, it's so easy to get in and out of downtown to visit, to see a show, to just hang out.

"Experience in different cities really has driven home how huge the ""ease of access"" thing is.

Will the parking garages be full? How far we will have to walk? What about getting home afterwards? Will we be stuck in a parking deck for an hour afterwards trying to get out?

Those details add up. We went to see Wicked at the Tanger Center last year and left really early, not sure what to expect with traffic and parking. Took us ten minutes to get downtown with minimal traffic, drove straight into Church Street Parking Deck and paid $10 right at the entrance, walked five minutes past beautiful LeBauer Park lit up for the night and full of families having fun and eating dinner.

"In the time I’ve lived in Greensboro I have experienced traffic equal or worse to that of Charlotte, drivers in Charlotte have been so much better. The cost of living here is just as high as it was in Charlotte last year when I lived there. In fact, my bills are higher here. The safe areas are even unaffordable. I can’t say the job market is any good because it took me 3 months to find an okay job (with 2 degrees and tons of experience in many fields). I’ve lived in very unsafe and safe neighborhoods in Greenville, Charlotte, Goldsboro, and I don’t feel at all safer here than I did anywhere else. It honestly looks much less safe but I’m not going to say whether or not it’s safer. The people I’ve met who grew up here don’t speak very well for the schools so I also don’t have an opinion on that, i know I don’t want my baby to go to school here though.

"Plastic flask but gotta keep alcohol content low or will deteriorate inside of flask… personal experience with sneaking 120 proof whiskey in a silicone camping flask that end up ruining the whiskey.

"Edit: sorry, I just read your previous posts and comments. You don't have a GCS child. You are a young twenty something who went to NCSU and presumably graduated with a BS in Human Resources and BA in Film Studies. I'm not even sure you understand how large a middle school needs to be or what needs to happen to improve our schools. 

Baseball and softball aren't a big enough deal for me to deprive our entire community of a quality education in the best environment possible. This bond does that.

You and others took a look at the site? What was the land area of the current Brooks site as compared to the current Kiser site? Did your group take into account traffic flow and parking, which Kiser is already lacking? Putting the site further back on the property allows for a larger, more appropriately sized school building, appropriate amounts of parking, and increased efficiency in traffic flow. With the placement of Jamieson stadium, the best place for this is the baseball and softball fields. 


You are depriving MORE students by withholding the funding and being unreasonable. In fact, you are holding ALL of the students hostage in many of the GCS schools for your one child who plays a particular sport. 

You are ridiculous. I'm sure that's why Pat won't return your messages. I hope our neighbors have more sense than you.

"I am not suggesting that it is less expensive to demolish a building than build on mostly open land, however Brooks will still need to be torn down as the school is moving sites. I believe we should go ahead and do it so we can move forward with this plan that will benefit ALL students in the long run. By voting down the bond in May, the school board will receive our message, change corse, place a new, more reasonable bond on the November ballot and all will be well.

"I appreciate you’re response. While that is only one issue to vote down the bond, I also do believe it is a dangerous amount of money, especially with the volatility in our economic markets right now, however that is a different discussion. I do believe a strong message though needs to be sent to those that sit on the school board, as they have kept the entire community in the dark on this issue. They cannot earn trust until they are transparent, and I can assure you they’ve been everything but that. I would happily vote in favor of a reasonable amount of money, such as the $300 million that was recently passed (although it has hardly been touched), so that we can make improvements to schools such as Northwest. It’s never an easy decision when our students will bear the effects of said decision, but I believe in the long run, the effects will be minimized by sending a strong message to the school board, and we do this by voting down this bond.

"Local taxes can only be raised through property taxes or sales tax. Income tax is only from the state or federal government.

The sales tax increase that they asked for was for 0.25%, which I believe they're asking for again. This would raise our sales tax from 6.75% to 7%, which is the sales tax rate in all of our surrounding counties, excluding Alamance. This is the sales tax rate for 44 out of 100 counties already.  Wake and Mecklenburg have a 7.25% sales tax and Orange has a 7.5% sales tax. Food tax is still lower at 2%. Although sales tax is regressive,  this increase seems reasonable. Raising property tax rates would still impact the cost of living and raise rents, which are already too high. Those are our only options for local tax. 

This improvement to our schools needs to happen. We've had a conservative council for too long that has completely ignored school capital improvements in urban areas. When a tornado ripped through the east side and condemned Hampton Elementary, those students were sent to Reedy Fork Elementary, an elementary school in Brown Summit built in 2007 that is so large it can hold two student populations.

"I’d argue it’s actually the uninformed that would vote yes. If you were informed on how our school board operates, you’d assuredly vote no. This school board doesn’t rebuild smart, and they don’t use the funds they are given for the best interest of all students. Take what is happening with Kiser Middle School for example... the school board is secretly planning to build it on top of grimsley’s baseball and softball fields. I use the word secret, because although this is the plan, they won’t be transparent with the community about it. How is oppressing the baseball and softball programs in the best interest for the students? There is ample land on the site that Brooks Global is currently sitting on to re-build Kiser. This land will be freed up when Brooks, very soon, moves to the old Craven Elementary site. But you see, the school board didn’t make this decision. They hired an independent contracting team to survey the land and the schools. Of course they are going to say Kiser needs to be re-built, and it is easiest to build it on top of Grimsley’s baseball and softball fields, but is it smart for the students? No. GCS wants to give off the impression that they are being impartial, however they are only being ignorant. They should be partial. They should be partial towards the students. They don’t care enough to realize this. In fact, Deborah Napper, who is the school board member that represents Grimsley, hasn’t even gone out to view the site for herself... and we are going to trust these people with $1.7 billion? No way. Our schools need repairs, but we cannot simply throw around this significant amount of money for our irresponsible and out of touch school board to abuse it.

"I just stumbled across this post in my pursuit of a better mechanic recommendation in Greensboro! I got my car back from Caliber collision in late February 2022 after they had it since 12/30.

I went to pick it up on 3 different occasions bc their work wasn’t well done and I asked it be fixed. I have a piece of trim on the passenger side door that keeps popping up. I can pop it back in but the point is that it KEEPS popping up. 🙄 The first time I went to pick it up there was a (granted, small) dent visible when you opened the door that wasn’t popped out. 

But overall, the body work was decent despite taking a long time and having to make correction requests. 

My biggest problem with them was the automotive work which they contracted out to Beamer. It was not okay at all, my suspension is making awful sounds, way worse than it was even in its fully damaged state, something seems to have come loose I think. I know suspension work is part to get right- but they got it very wrong. The second time I went to pick it up, the wheel alignment was completely off, like 30 degrees almost, which shows someone just didn’t care and Calliber didn’t pay attention before giving it back.

I communicated with Sierra there who was friendly and listened but regardless, the results I got just sucked and I’m back to looking. If it was only body work I might say go for it but the automotive work is what was most annoying for me to experience.

Most people here are either actively accepting or passively ambivalent.

That being said, just like anywhere there are turds that wanna ruin everyone's good time and I have had run-ins with aggressive men.

As for neighborhoods, my first thought would be Lindley Park area and/or downtown areas for a younger, more funky vibe.  Westerwood area and all around the UNCG campus also comes to mind.

"My Contractor was fantastic. We had a surprise hole in the foundation in our crawl and he and his crew cleaned it up, closed up the hole and triple checked their work and even put in a brand new vapor barrier. He even came on a day it rained to inspect and ensure their work was holding up. 

He also gave us a realistic appraisal and was open and honest about everything they saw. He gave recommendations, what he could do with different price points and wouldn't act without my approval. I'm from up north and I've never met such an honest contractor before.

 We even had them do mold treatment (they're licensed and insured, I had them send me the binder) and I had them come back to help build stairs and an awning for us to get into the basement more easily. Next work we do? I'm calling him again. He's a small family owned business with a great crew.

Often 10 percent of my order total. I add money if I notice it’s over 5 miles away or bad weather conditions. Every time I order I literally pay 20 dollars on top of my actual food plus tax.

"Think this only happens in Greensboro? It literally happens in every city where DD exists. Exactly why I quit DD.  I’m not paying to work. Been with Shipt for almost 2 years. Way less miles on car bc big portion of time spent shopping.  
I avg $27-$37 per hour now, almost faithfully.  I do 20-30 orders a week. Even after gas and expenses, doing good. 
Shipt allows customers to have “preferred” shoppers and I hv 50 of those ppl. I get those orders before others, tho some exceptions to that. Even if I’m not scheduled.  
They also do “member matches”. If a person rates me a 5 more than once, I’m matched with them. Now I won’t always get their orders but more likely, if I’m scheduled.  
I did UE, Lyft, DD…shipt is only one I could make worth my time and even then, I still have an off week a couple times a year. 

It does baffle me that ppl will tip $35 on a shopped grocery order but won’t tip for me to drive their entire family safely from point A to point B.

Yes, people need to tip more for the service they’re requesting, but if they don’t and you decline those orders, it’s on them if their food gets cold.

Part of not wanting to be an employee of these apps means you have the right to refuse deliveries that pay too little. If all the orders need to be declined and it’s hurting your bottom line, then it’s time to re-evaluate whether doing this type of work makes sense for you.

"People are willing to pay something for the convenience of having their food delivered to them, but when you have to pay a delivery fee AND tip the driver, it's no longer worth it. We all know that the delivery driver doesn't get the delivery fee, but since it's mandatory and baked into the price, the only part that people are able to opt out of is the tip- which is exactly what you're seeing.

Since covid we are not allowed to open bags to check their contents, we have to trust the restaurant got everything in it. A few restaurants I picked up from before covid used to show us every item to insure they got everything and to make us sign we picked up everything, they have not done that since covid changes sadly.So I 100% agree with post tip, but also to do that the apps would need to pay us .56 per mile as base pay. They do not do that, and I feel it is pretty simple to just not order if you don't agree to pay enough for the drivers time, and be sure to complain when something is off that is or you think could have been the drivers fault.

"Sometimes they will stack the order, on most apps you don't know which order actually tipped. That is an issue with the app not the driver in most cases when they are driving a crazy route.   
Not to mention some drivers are paranoid into this trap the apps set of ""Top Dasher"" and ""Premier Driver"" etc, you have to accept 95% of the orders that come through (also what you need to recieve floor pay). If they reject even one stack add on (which I get all the time and decline because they are unfair to the customer) they lose their ""status"". It is really sad the fear culture these apps promote.  
Also yes, in my other comments I mentioned that the apps could easily solve this problem by increasing their fees in the app by enough to cover a standard minimum most of us have (it is heavily discussed in forums most have $8 minimum and at least $1 a mile), then passing that on to us would be perfect.

"I’m going to leave my disdain for tipping culture aside, because I do agree with you. 

If you’re ordering food (thru an app, direct from the restaurant, etc), you have to be willing to pay for that service. Paying for that service in your mind should be via the driver’s tip, not any “delivery fees” or the like, because that just goes straight to the company providing the delivery service. 

$5 should be a minimum starting point and adjust up from there based on distance, ease of restaurant access, busy restaurant/platform (look at the time difference between delivery and pick up and you can judge how busy either the restaurant or platform is), how easy is it to deliver to you - business, home, apartment, etc. 

If it gets too expensive with tips, fees, etc. then it’s time to pick it up yourself. Don’t sacrifice the tip to get yours, because you’re telling that driver their time and effort is not valued for bringing your food. 

And before y’all say the delivery drivers are trash here, still tip. Help your neighbor out.

"> plumbers that advertise through craigslist, the app is the craigslist that connects the customer to us, but you pay the app while thinking we should work for free, that is evil of you

This is an inaccurate analogy, because you don't go to post on doordash and say ""I'll bring you food from these restaurants for $x, where as food from these restaurants will cost you $y dollars."" That is what a plumber on craigslist does, they advertise their services and tell customers, up front when possible, what those services cost. 

>Again I AM NOT AN EMPLOYEE, WE DO NOT WORK FOR THE APP, THEY ARE NOT OUR EMPLOYERS

So you are correct, you are (for tax purposes explicitly) not an employee of the delivery companies. You are self-employed and agree to complete tasks for a company. Most people don't really describe real life in IRS or legal terms, though, so colloquially, or in every day language, people still refer to independent contractors as ""employees"" while the company hiring them is considered the ""employer"", it's just that they employ contractors instead of employees. It's just a means to describe the dynamic, one person has work they want done, one person is doing the work for them. Insulting people that you're trying to sway to your viewpoint is rarely an effective means of expressing yourself, and you should really consider how you talk to people, even when you're clearly upset. 

>it would be much better to do so if I didn't have to reject YOUR shit no paying offers

Is this all really because you have to reject a couple of deadbeats? Have you tried expressing this feedback to the companies you choose to work for? I would imagine they are more capable of providing you with an amenable solution than you are likely to stumble upon one by cursing at strangers on the internet.


>that poor driver doing the actual work, fuck him you wont pay him a dime, you cheap piece of shit.

Should people start tipping grocery store employees who are stocking shelves, or the receptionist at the dentists' office? Those people get fucked while their CEOs get paid, too. I mean, all of us do, really. Some get fucked harder by others, but we're all getting fucked, my man. I get it, you're upset that doordash et al have all this money to throw around and meanwhile they force you to live off the ""kindness"" of others, during a time with rapid inflation, the end of a global pandemic and an uncertain economy. So maybe just ... don't work for them? These sort of businesses wouldn't be able to exist if their labor pool dried up, and you don't really have a leg to stand on to be mad at low/no tippers when you're willing to continue working for companies that allow that behavior. 

All that said, I agree with your message when it's worded correctly. Don't participate in services paid primarily by tips if you don't want to tip. But I just feel like that's sort of blaming a baby for taking a shit. They(the baby, no-tippers absolutely should know better) don't know any better. If I didn't want to clean up baby shit, I shouldn't have had a baby. Well, if you know that people can be dicks and don't tip, and you don't want to work for tips, maybe you just shouldn't work those jobs where you're paid primarily by tips?

MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP NOT TIPPING, AND START ACTUALLY READING WHAT WAS SAID, ALL THESE ORDERS DO IS WASTE OUR TIME, HURT THE RESTAURANTS, AND MAKE OUR JOB MORE DANGEROUS.

"No, and you completely miss the point. We reject your orders, but you sending in your cheap ass lazy ass no tip order when you are too damn lazy to go get it yourself and you don't want to pay the damn driver to bring you the food you are too damn lazy to go get, we have to sit there wasting our time rejecting them, and while that piece of trash is comming through we could be getting a better offer that actually pays properly, so while we make our money your shit head no tipping dont wanna waste your own gas lazy ass orders are affecting the system, wasting drivers time, lowering drivers income, hurting the restaurants and ONLY helping the big app corps. JUST STOP DOING IT.

"There are so many misunderstandings repeated here -

First, you repeatedly say you should make more than “unskilled jobs like burger flippers.” This demonstrates a disconnect between your perception of your work and reality. The vast majority of people would not differentiate between the skill levels of those roles.

Second, you repeatedly compare yourself to plumbers etc who advertise through Craigslist, Angie’s list, etc. If you have ever hired a plumber, you’ll know that you agree on both the job and price upfront with them. They do not expect tips. If you wanted to do the same, you could advertise independent delivery services at $1/mile. But until you do that, this is a ridiculous comparison. A subcontracting delivery driver of Uber eats is not equivalent to a self employed tradesperson in how they agree on work and payment with customers.

Finally, you’ve mentioned a few times that your corporate employers don’t care at all whether or not people cancel their orders because of the “float” they get to make on the interest from millions of pennies. The absurdity of this claim is provable from several angles: first, it’s mathematically unsound. Do the math on a single digit % return for a few days minus transaction costs. Second, you can see how these companies burn VC money in order to corner markets and get people to order regularly. They wouldn’t do this if your “interest on the float” theory held water.

"Do you often hire people from Craigslist without agreeing with them ahead of time how much they are selling their labor for?

We have a weird tipping culture and I used to be a delivery driver, so I tip $4 minimum for deliveries. But the reality is that *you* are deciding how much your labor is worth - if you are in fact losing money via whatever delivery service you work for, then stop working for them! Go get a regular income that doesn’t depend on tips (line cook, stocker, etc). Or move into a delivery line that doesn’t have a tipping culture (FedEx, usps, etc).

"THat ""delivery fee"" has nothing to do with the actual delivery though. You still need to pay your driver, we DO NOT GET THOSE FEES. Again I stress too that if you don't want to pay for the driver's time, then please just call the restaurant, order your food, and go get it yourself, it is not only better for the driver but it is also way better for the restaurant.

I have to be correct here, we do get a portion of those fees, at a rate of around 17-25 cents per mile, depending on area and which app... but even the government considers average vehicle maintenance (including gas) to be 56 cents per mile. So we literally lose money if you don't tip, just paying for the maintenance on our vehicle. We get nothing if we have to sit at the restaurant and wait on your food, so this also means good tip we wait you get it hot, bad tip we unassign the order and head out to a different one, your food bounces around an hour or two and is nice and cold before you get it.",t2_ag0jsy3m,MythmoorXype,0,1647060017.0,0,t1_i0c0pel,i0c0pel,False,MythmoorXype,t3_tc34jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/tc34jm/stop_being_cheap/,stop being cheap,/r/gso/comments/tc34jm/stop_being_cheap/i0c0pel/,3,r/gso,0,3

"Uhh yes, we reject offers that don't pay what we like. However if you just plain wouldn't order food while refusing to pay the driver a decent amount, then the apps would compensate us when we don't hit a floor goal in an hour, it isn't much but we are also not wearing out our car while sitting in a parking lot. But with your no pay orders, we reject them, then are no longer qualified to recieve the floor pay, and that is 100% your fault for being cheap.

Also no, you might want to go look up the definition of independant contractor, the ability to lose money is the #1 requirement to not be considered an employee.

They also make money everytime we don't accept a job. Even if you cancel your order they get to profit off the interest of holding your money for that brief time. We don't work for them, in fact I ""USE"" 6 different apps at a time all the time, taking the best out of each that comes across. However again all the apps have the same problem cheap people that want to pay for a roach motel but stay in the 5 star hilton.
