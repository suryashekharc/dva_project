"Well... it's great for nightlife, but only if you really don't mind driving at 2am when the clubs close. Our public transportation fucking sucks. Seattle and Portland are far better for this kind of thing.

Use Meetup.com and check out the LA Redditors meetups next time you visit, before moving out here.

Honestly though, you kind of come across as a douchebag in your comments, like calling people morons. 

One of the most reliable job markets, especially in the Santa Monica and Orange County areas (which really isn't Los Angeles, but pretty close) is tech, whether you're a developer or in IT. The first requires an understanding of a shitfuckton of logic, programming and math (which you apparently aren't good at, from your post history) and the second is a technical trade that requires extremely good critical thinking skills and even better interpersonal skills... which, again, you might not be great at given your lack of patience.

Rent is fucking expensive. Expect to pay at least 1200-1600 for a 1br apartment, depending on your area. Living off of a 50k salary by yourself is going to hurt, if you're even half-serious about saving for retirement. You need at least 75k to feel 'comfortable' and 100k to really enjoy the nightlife and affluent activities and eats on Ventura Blvd, Santa Monica or Hollywood proper. You can even make a career out of this nightlife, but it's more than full time, it's a 24/7 job (a friend of mine is a promoter and organizes girl-filled limos to clubs several times a week, and I'm surprised his liver hasn't exploded on him yet from his daily drinking). This, of course, requires good executive and organizational skills, and, yes, more fucking math. In fact, I wouldn't put it past him to be a fucking drunken accounting spreadsheet genius.

"FTFY

I grew and lived in phoenix,AZ my whole life but I have traveled a lot and have fallen in love with Los angeles so many times. I am really interested in media and lifestyle of los angeles (If I am wealthy). But generally speaking, would anyone have any personal comments on this?

Are the people social there, or is it really hard to make friends? It seems one thing is for sure and that is the fact that there are endless things to do. Beaches, world known theme parks, beaches, celebrities, nightlife, very affluent areas/people, and multi-cultural. I love the city life and huge cities, but do you guys think it would be a good fit for me as someone who is really outgoing/adventurous and how is the job market (like whats in demand). Thanks!

You've been through a lot in the last year and a half.  You must be experiencing so much grief for losing so many close people in such a short amount of time.  That kind of loss takes time to heal, but it is possible.

Please reach out to someone.  You could try joining a bereavement support group or [forum](http://forums.grieving.com/). It might help to connect to others who have experienced loss due to illness, accidents, or [suicide](http://survivorsofsuicide.com/).  [Our House Grief Support Center](http://www.ourhouse-grief.org/) has a location in LA and they offer several workshops, support groups, and other kinds of help.  Their number is 310.473.1511.

You might also want to join us in /r/SuicideWatch; there are a lot of us who have been to that point of so much pain that it seems like suicide is the only way to cope, and there are a lot of us who have moved beyond that point to find peace.

"The only white people I ever saw growing up where the teachers. So I didn't grow up with direct racism. My community was fragmented I'm Chicano and as early I could remember I've had black friends. Growing up I realized my dad was prejudice against black people. When people steal your License Plate sticker, car batteries, and then you see them sell it to others its just logical they would become his scapegoat. 

After the Rodney King riots many of the big grocery stores left the community, and growing up the closest thing were liquor stores. We have tons of fast food restaurants, and it wasn't until about two years ago that we finally have a nearby Subway and Fresh & Easy. Both of these are on Central near Newton Division. This may not be a big deal, but a while ago I was at a meeting and during break I asked if there was a nearby liquor store. The employees gave me a weird look and made a joke about it being to early for alcohol, and all I wanted was sodas and snacks. As a kid you always go down to liquor stores to buy junk food. There were 4 liquor stores no more than two blocks from my house. 

I'm going to visit my girlfriend in OC before traffic gets bad. 

Funny story:
My gf lives in Orange County near Disneyland and the first time I was there I hear loud explosions and she saw me freak out. Man I thought shit was going down. It turned out it was just the fireworks.

"Well, it's been an interesting day looking into all the links I've gotten, both here and in PM's.  As a disinterested party I do have some observations about the whole fiasco that I'll offer to share.

It's pretty undeniable that there's still some butt hurt about it considering some of the things that turned up in my inbox.

""Regarding the two LA subreddits, don't listen to anything _______ has to say.""

Not a very good way to present a case, I must say. A lot of the links I received are dead now so I didn't get too far into the he said/she said part of it, but there was plenty of attitude and petulance present in the links I did read to get the gist of it.  I've also seen some pretty imaginative (if not slightly paranoid) interpretations of what people have said to each other.

The job of being a mod on reddit isn't all that appealing. It's kind of like being the security guard at a sewer plant and having the additional duty of picking turds out of the strainer. Yum. There has to be something about it that makes someone want to take it on and the only thing I can imagine is the faux status of having an [M] behind your fake name. 

Now tell me that isn't funny.

Out in the real world a grown man knows when he has too much on his plate. It becomes obvious when the little things start to suffer from lack of attention; the kids complain that they need new shoes and the engine clatters when it goes without oil and you're just too busy to deal with it.  A grown man knows when to adjust his priorities, pick the ones that are most important and let go of the rest so the important ones don't suffer. One man alone can only raise so many cows and knows when to hire a few hands to help. And that's not when the cows are sick and starving, it's well before. Knowing when to step aside and let others is a hard thing to learn.

I've read enough around reddit to understand that the subs are set up in such a manner that they are functional dictatorships and sometimes those little fiefdoms can get ugly.  I also know that any particular sub doesn't *have* to be this way. It can actually become a democratic proposition if a smart dictator allows it and that can actually spur a lot of  growth.  People on reddit already have a sense of ownership; actually having a vote naturally reinforces that.  That's just plain common sense.

The one thing that still isn't clear to me is why meet ups are being organized outside of reddit at a for-profit website. There's nothing that is being done there that can't be done right here in house and the only clear advantage is for the guy who pockets the money. I don't buy the personal info excuse since we have PM's right here that work just fine. I know because I've used them to share my personal info on a couple of occasions.

So, wtf, people?   I understand why there are two LA subs now, but having read through the offered evidence, it seems really petty and doesn't reflect on LA redditors well at all.  It's past time to do some growing up and getting it together.

"yeah, r/losangeles was kind of dead for a while but then people started to take interest in it as reddit grew. omfgninja, the sole moderator, was MIA so The_Gopher put in a reddit request to take control of the subreddit. Request approved, The_Gopher starts sprucing things up and r/losangeles finally starts to look like an active community. This woke up omfgninja from his sleepy abode in Bakersfield and the reddit admins said ""my bad"" and gave the subreddit back to omfgninja. A shitstorm then broke out as omfgninja declared they weren't going to add any other mods and especially not The_Gopher and you guys totally need to trust me now and you all are lucky I'm even keeping the CSS up. Well this didn't go over well with a subreddit that had been completely neglected by omfgninja until it was taken away from them and that had experienced the brief, but more responsive rule of The_Gopher and quite a few people accused omfgninja of basically holding onto power for power's sake. Many wanted an alternative LA subreddit, and omfgninja banned several of the most vocal agitators from r/losangeles. So that's why there are two subreddits and they're not likely to merge anytime soon.

"Visitor from /r/VenturaCounty. I've been to a few of the meetups in LA and IMHO, they are too big. You have 30+ people every time so no one becomes anything more than ""internet friends"" which makes people unlikely to do meetups. 

I've organized around 15 meetups in the last 6 months for Ventura County and the one most people had the least fun at, was the one with 30+ people. 

My suggestion is that now that the honeymoon has worn off and now it's just a small subset that actually want to continue to do meetups try again and with the smaller group, I think they'll be much more successful.

"I've lived in Glendale for 23 years and after browsing so many threads like this, I've secretly always wanted someone to post asking about Glendale.

Here I am 13 days later.

* [Toasted Bun](http://www.yelp.com/biz/toasted-bun-restaurant-glendale) - Lexington & California - Good old fashioned breakfast.  I simply can't explain it any better.

Favorite thing here: Toasted Bun omelette with some extra stuff added (forget)

* [Foxy's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/foxys-restaurant-glendale) - Colorado St. near the Glendale Mall - Also another great breakfast place.  More selection/variety than Toasted Bun.  More mexican food style dishes. (huevos rancheros and stuff)

Favorite thing here: Again, some omelette can't remember the name, sorry.

* [Troy's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/troys-drive-in-6-glendale) - S. Glendale Ave. (South of Colorado) - One of those hole-in-the-wall burger joints.  I eat here almost 2 times a week because I live near by and I'm lazy.  Don't get anything here other then Burgers and Fries.  Their burritos/tacos anything like that is horrendous.  Don't order Gyros.  Don't order anything you would not normally order at a BURGER place.  I like their breakfast sandwiches too (again, not the breakfast burrito).  Their steak sandwich is really good too.

Favorite thing here: Chilli Chz Fries or Eggs/Bacon/Cheese Sandwich in the morning w/ everything (lettuce/tomato/mayo)

* [Taco Azteca](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-azteca-glendale-2) - S. Verdugo Rd. Next to Glendale High School - Great taco stand.  Good burritos/tacos/quesadillas.  Their red salsa is really tasty.  I wouldn't get the chicken from here, it's really not that good.

Favorite thing here: Steak burrito!

* [Mamita's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mamita-peruvian-restaurant-glendale#query:mamitas) - S. Brand Blvd next to BMW dealer ship - Awesome Peruvian food.  If you haven't had Peruvian food, I'd say it's a great mixture of mexican/chinese type dishes.  The Lomo Saltado is awesome over there and they sell their hot sauce by the bottle.  It's so  amazing tasting.  I think it's called Aji sauce.

Favorite thing here: the hotsauce and lomo saltado

* [Raffi's Place](http://www.yelp.com/biz/raffis-place-restaurant-glendale) - On Broadway between Maryland and Louis - The best Kabob (Persian food) place in Glendale.  No questions asked.  Prepare to be full for 24hrs after eating here.  

Favorite thing here: Soltani plate (Combination of Ground beef skewers and flattened steak filets)  WARNING this can easily feed 2

* [Mario's Italian Deli](http://www.yelp.com/biz/marios-italian-deli-and-market-glendale) - On Broadway (Major x-street is Glendale Ave) - I love this place.  Such a wide selection of deli meats/cheeses.  Best sandwiches EVER.  Everything here is amazing.  Their hot pastrami sandwich is ridiculous.  The meatball sandwich is amazing.  EVERYTHING is amazing here.  Authentic italian sauces, olive oils and other oils and spaghettis and stuff you can buy. 

Favorite thing here: All the sandwiches.

* [Hong Kong Kitchen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hong-kong-kitchen-glendale) - Pacific Ave and Palm st - Chinese restaurant with huge portions.  Nobody beats their lunch special.  You get your dish of choice (Orange Chicken/Kung Pao Chicken/etc. [million to choose from freshly cooked when you order]) side of fried rice or white rice, a creamcheese wonton, an eggroll, a salad, and hot & sour soup or egg flower soup for $7!  

Favorite thing here: The Curry Chicken is my favorite dish.


Hope you see this and comes in handy for anybody! Feel free to ask me about practically anything you can think of.  I love this place!


P.S. I used yelp just so you can get a better idea of practically everything about the place, I'm not in anyway affiliated w/ that shit :D

"Living in Glendale for 5 years now. My favorite things about it:

* Brand Park, at the north end of Western. Nice big park with a cool hiking trail at the end behind the library. Great view of Glendale/the valley from up there  
* Rocky's Fish and Poultry, in Burbank kinda over by the Ikea. Great food  
* Elena's in Glendale. Great Armenian food, and not too pricey  
* Glendale Galleria. I like the mall in general but stay far, far away on weekends and especially holidays because it's a royal pain in the ass to navigate. The Americana's aiight

"Hey - I'm a little northeast of Brand and Glenoaks, so I just walk straight up the roads to the water storage thing.  I have also walked all the way around (onto Mountain) and hiked to the radio antenna a few times (that's like a 4 hour trip).  You can get to the same spot by driving to the library/park at the top of Western and hiking from there.

Monopoly?  Ewww..  ;)  Settlers is really the first of the ""modern board games"" that you want to play.  Once you figure out how amazing it is, definitely play Dominion (everyone loves it, every gender, every age) and Ticket to Ride (I do not like Ticket, but I'm apparently the only one in the universe who feels this way).  If you like family games/games which girls enjoy (quite seriously), buy Bohnanza (aka ""BEAN GAME!  LET'S PLAY BEAN GAME!""

They're important considerations also considering the fact that a lot of places close... KIIINDA stupid-early in these parts. There's also a 24 hour grocery store (Vons on Pass Ave.), and a few of the CVS' are 24 hours as well (Hollywood Way and San Fernando are two that come to mind).

"Ha! Really all I'm looking for is what places people who know the area frequent, you know? I mean, I can find the nearest Trader Joe's or Target online without bothering anyone, but finding hole in the wall taco places (or whatever)? That's where you hit up the locals. :)

I came from a *very* small suburb of LA where the traffic is *much* lighter than I'm finding it to be in other places...I used to think Pasadena traffic was crazy. Heh. So any back ways to get main places is also appreciated. Like alternatives to main streets, etc. I usually come at Glendale Eastbound on Foothill and it's not too bad there, but that's not the downtown area. Traffic gets much worse as you get closer to metro areas, of course.

"This is the same thing I did, and a couple of time just handed over the fake looking temp license without any picture ID.  Never had a problem with anyone not accepting the two together.  If you get hassled, ask for a manager if you are in a larger grocery/liquor store.  If you're trying to get into a bar, you may be out of luck.

The other option is to carry your passport with you, but I would be freaked out about losing that. 

As to the time it takes to get your new license, mine took about 5 weeks. I moved here in December, so it might have longer than usual.

As to getting your car registration moved to California - if you haven't done it yet, get your car smogged before going to the DMV.
