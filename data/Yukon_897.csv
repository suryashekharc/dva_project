"That's fine, they don't have to like history. But perpuating false narratives is how we got people thinking the streets of Dawson were wild affairs when in reality Edwardian mannerisms meant the upper classes were trying desperately to cling to British mannerisms in the wake of the unknown. Teetotalers were rampant.

Considering the gold rush brought in 100 000+ people to yukon, only 30 000 made it to Dawson, the majority left by 1901 and there was a reported ~9000 people there which dropped to ~3000 in 1911 and 975 in 1921. We can see the majority of people that stayed were successful in living up here, and the ""individualists survalists "" mostly followed the gold to Nome in 1904.

"Your friend sounds like she came from a school in a high socio economic area. She possibly just taught in an area where high achievers could be steamed differently. 
I am sure there was a diverse group of learners but they likely were kept in places like reserves or in a different classroom or school. If she doesn’t like teaching to a diverse population and trying to make a difference she is always welcome to return to Ontario. They actually pay similar and have more paid prep time. 
As a well educated Yukoner who has spent enough time down south, it becomes tiresome listening to people who move up from other places and criticize how things are here or try to make them what they left.

"There's quite a few local restaurants that would totally find a way to help if you call them and tell them what's up.

Kits kitchen, sourdoughnuts, daddy doughnuts, blackbird bakery, comprade burritos, baked Cafe, burnt toast, wood st ramen, and many more.

If you call them and explain that you want to choose local over a big app, they will appreciate the business. 

Theres a fb group called Yukon Helpers Network that is very active and you will find people that will volunteer to deliver whatever you want to a new mamma!

Funny you say they are a parrot when that is EXACTLY what you are doing. Almost word for word I can find what you have typed on any social media site. Keep saying you’re doing it for all of us when it’s only your selfish reasons for doing so. Keep saying it was for mandates when people are waking up to the fact that it was really about overthrowing the government and trying to put white nationalists into parliament. The MOU and the freedom convoy websites says different. Check out “action 4 Canada” one of the sites that started the convoy and tell me you support their ideas and views. That is the true face of the leaders of the convoy. These snakes of leaders took people that were frustrated that their choice of not getting vaccinated came with inconveniences and riled them up to use the numbers of people to be intimidating. They actually thought that they could put unelected people into parliament by harassing Ottawa. This whole thing is a joke and has been from the beginning. People were used and they refuse to see it.

"Hmmm..... Is it an off-grid place? And what was the temperature like? And was the person also working or solely house sitting? 

I think it's possible there may be a few other factors to consider here... 

I've house sat once before and was surprised but grateful, when the owners returned they gave me a pretty big cash bonus (about $100/week) and the house was not off grid (tho was wood heat, but really good stove), just two dogs, and late winter so no cold weather, and I wasn't working, only house sitting 

I know it's tough to change plans / reimbursement ideals when in the midst of it all, but maybe there were challenges that were unexpected or hadn't been thought about ... 

Sry to hear tho....

">  the party that won the popular vote 

We don't have a popular vote in Canadian electoral systems.   Even if we did, the Yukon party would not be described as having the popular vote because the combined other parties are much greater than 50%. At best the Yukon party can be described as the majority minority in vote allocation.

Furthermore, the only reason why the election voting pattern emerged is because of how the electoral districts are drawn.  There are well populated ridings that voted heavily in favour of the Yukon Party.  However those votes only send 1 MLA into government.  Any extra votes above the lowest plurality are essentially wasted as no extra seats are going to be procured. 

So as much as you can say those extra Yukon party votes are wasted, pretty much any vote that didn't result in an elected official are also wasted.",t2_8u1wm,Muskowekwan,0,1646433324.0,0,t1_hzdkwc2,hzdkwc2,False,thelastyukonhunter,t3_t6p425,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yukon/comments/t6p425/yukon_political_leanings/,Yukon Political Leanings,/r/Yukon/comments/t6p425/yukon_political_leanings/hzdkwc2/,2,r/Yukon,0,2

The only there are two things to consider when looking at party politics. The first is the people with similar beliefs will always group together.

"I was there in 2020, it was a good time considering it was 28 in 28 out then, COVID protocols were fresh when I left, literally the shift before the outbreaks started happening. 

They block porn, all good websites etc so learn to use a VPN before you go or come prepared. 90% of the men there are far too stupid to figure this out and within a couple weeks everyone becomes a testosterone filled piss pot. 

The food is really good for a camp, steak Saturdays etc. Fried food Fridays but lunches get old fast.  Camp life is pretty boring but they try to have fun as a group, I was fortunate to have a couple friends on the same shift. The gym is good, rarely full. The company strives to employ anyone and will work with those with disabilities. My old room neighbour was a one legged d10 operator.

I worked in processing and holy fuck did we ever get treated like shit by most every other crews on site, especially by gods gift to earth, the millwrights. There was an incident between a grown ass 50 year old man from down south and a fresh 18 year old watson lake contractor that almost ended in a scrap and it was literally over our water and coffee because the millwrights would ALWAYS use our processing break room for whatever they wanted so we'd always be low on supplies and then freak the fuck out at us for filling our water bottles with their water. The next day that old man went to commissary and bought and left a pack of tampons on the 18 year olds truck, this is the level of maturity that is normal there.

Racism is a huge barrier to overcome if you're Indigenous but that's nothing new for the industry. It's not to say everyone is a piece of shit there but no one's going to jump in between you and the loud, racist 50 year old from Alberta who thinks we don't pay taxes because we work on ""band land"".

It is insanely easy to get fired from this camp, they take piss tests very seriously but if you're a Yukoner you likely will only get swabbed for pre employment rather than the piss test that they make all the Southerners take. They will swab you on site at their own discretion, I've seen people get escorted off site for barely testing positive for THC a week into shift. They fired my favourite supervisor on the last day of a shift for snapchatting while on the site, that was a huge dagger, everyone loved that guy.

Go work there, keep your head down, as mentioned in the previous comment, they will fast track you if you work hard and put yourself out there. They taught me to run 993k loaders the size of houses with literally no HEO experience before, I was a cook/baker before working at Vic Gold. They put me in the secondary crusher control room within two shifts because I mentioned to the boss that I have a lot of experience with computers and software. They will also pay you more per month to work there as a Yukoner by about $600/month.

"this is really helpful information. Thank you!!

I had 2 trips last year. 
One trip, i only have 2 fuel receipts that i fueled up in Whitehorse before and after the trip. And i made an etransfer to a friend who had the trip together. I have a bunch of photos. But no receipts other than the 2 fuel receipts made in Whitehorse. I guess I shouldn’t claim this trip sadly..

The other trip, I didn’t keep food and accommodation receipts. But i have all the boarding passes and medical receipts outside Canada(it wasn’t a medical trip. So I’m not gonna claim this as a medical purpose. It’s tricky to be recognized as a medical trip I assume). The flight ticket is already a lot more expensive than the lowest airfare. So I think it should be fine that i don’t have all the receipts.
I had this trip between December 2021 and January 2022. Is that ok to claim for 2021 taxes?

"In Canada, visit Banff while the glacier is still there.

Stay away from the Yukon.  You don't want to camping that far north because severe weather can come at any time and there is a real danger of bears.  If you do go, pack a high-power shotgun, because that's the only way to stop a hungry grizzly.  Do NOT go near the coast.  There are polar bears and they know how to hide in the snow.  They will even cover their nose with the front paws so you won't see them until it is too late.   Kodiak Island is another place you should avoid because Kodiak bears are extremely dangerous and there's a lot of them.  I suggest you watch the movie ""The Edge"" to get an idea about brown bears.

2) ""Sourdough Polly"" was a Green Amazon Parrot who was left behind in Carcross in 1918.
As an orphan he was moved into the Caribou Hotel where he learned to sing opera and say very naughty words! He lived to be around 125 years old, and he was so popular and loved that, on his passing in 1972, he was given his own memorial stone in the Carcross cemetery.


My two favourite facts from my educational colouring book. I did a ton of research for the book so I got a bunch of crazy facts about our territory lol.  

With Polly, many resources claim he was an Red Macaw, but that’s actually false, he was in fact a  Green Amazon. I spoke to the current owners of the Carcross Hotel at length and they dug up old records for me as proof of what he really was! Learning about the hotel and Polly’s history was a blast.

"I can't speak for Evergreen but I've visited Whitehorse Physio about 3 years ago and was not impressed.

Being originally from BC, I've never been to a physio clinic where a single therapist would handle multiple patients simultaneously. The therapist would have 5-10 min consultation with me, perform light massage / dry needling, off to handle different patients, then come back to chat.  I just felt like another customer they had to deal with rather than a patient.  There were times when my injuries were barely addressed.

I've also been to Absolute. While they were a bit more attentive than WP, they still had the multiple patient thing going.

I would try Evergreen first then Absolute.  If you are comfortable with a male Physio, you could also check out Brad Holm ([https://www.holmtherapy.ca/](https://www.holmtherapy.ca/)).

> Fannin sheep, Sinclair argued, are particularly coveted among hunters and, had Lee sought to legally hunt one in the Yukon, he would have had to hire a local outfitter.

> It&#039;s not the first time that a hunter&#039;s photos have led to a fine - two hunters from British Columbia were convicted in 2015 of illegally harvesting Yukon sheep 13 years earlier, with prosecutors using the hunters&#039; own trophy hunting photos as evidence.

As for suggesting that I not fully understand the situation; do you? Pick 10 individuals protesting and ask them what their goals are or why they're upset and I bet you will receive 10 different answers.

Breach of medical confidentiality? Hardly so; what does it matter if a hostess at a restaurant knows if you've been vaccinated or not?

Government tracking us? Definitely not that, as they would have a far easier time doing so by using your smartphone (by the way, I guarantee you that private corporations know far more about you than the government ever will)

Being forced to take an ""unsafe"" vaccine? We're two years into this thing now and the scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows the benefits of being vaccinated well outweigh the risks; and for those who the vaccine may be risky provisions have been provided.

Being denied basic rights and freedoms? Absolutely incorrect. You can still bank, buy groceries, go to the park, go to Walmart or wherever else you want to go.

"OK. I’ll bite. The vast majority of Canadians do not support the so-called Freedom Convoy despite what their echo chamber social media circles would have them believe.  

I see them as a disgruntled, but entitled and unruly mob with no clear leadership or realistic and/or reasonable objective. 

Within their ranks are some truly unhinged and reprehensible individuals. They were as a whole a relatively peacefully assembled group, at least at first. As the protest became an occupation, however they lost the plot. 

Demanding that the GG dissolve Parliament and remove a democratically elected leader from power is not only unrealistic, it shows a complete lack of understanding as to how Canadian government works. 

To think that they could force the hand of the government to capitulate to their demands is ludicrous. 

Complaining that they are living under the boot of an oppressive government after spending three weeks completely unmolested parked on the doorstep of the Parliament buildings is a level of dumbness that I can’t even begin to fathom.",t2_5c0nemyh,truthsayer2021,0,1645334553.0,0,t1_hxo5igy,hxo5igy,True,cptnfunnypants,t3_swqyej,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yukon/comments/swqyej/thanks_for_fighting_for_our_freedom_guys/,"Thanks for fighting for our freedom, guys!",/r/Yukon/comments/swqyej/thanks_for_fighting_for_our_freedom_guys/hxo5igy/,43,r/Yukon,0,43
"Ok. I think we should address each comment. To state what the convoy was asking for because you are not exactly correct. They only wanted the mandates dropped and the arriveCan app dropped. That's it peroid. I can show you the video taped press releases if you haven't seen them.  Second. You do have the right to protest and annoy ppl. That's the idea. Start a dialog with those who refuse to. 

Third. You make a good point in messaging. I believe the best sell for a vaccine would be the clear evidence that natural immunity is neither robust or durable. But as you noted this isn't being addressed from either position because not saying it doesn't conflate with out being one or the other.

"Hi there!

Negative on having to transfer over or completing another test within our jurisdiction. Assuming you pass your A-EMCA licensing exam, that’ll be good enough for our service to move forward with your application. (There’s quite a bit of A-EMCA folks up here!)

I’d be more than happy to answer any additional questions regarding Yukon EMS or provide you with the contact information of any of our Commander of Whitehorse/ Community ops/ general hiring friends!

Currently working on a way to communicate this sorta information so that it’s readily available online. 

For your consideration at the Primary Care Paramedic level:

- Hourly wage depends on years of experience, starting at about $38 at the low end and $41.45 at the higher end (+5 years of PCP experience) new collective bargaining taking place - this hourly wage will change within the next few months. (Hourly should increase)
- 48 hr blocks on a 9-day rotation for permanent full time staff: 4 days on/ 5 days off (2 day shifts, 2 night shifts)
- overtime is paid out to a maximum of double your hourly wage (1.5x your hourly for the first 4 hours of overtime - then 2x your hourly for anything beyond that.)
- for permanent staff: sick; special; vacation; trauma leave available. In addition to all the other general benefits re: health, dental, psychological coverage, boot allowance etc etc. 
- federal gov. pension
- probably one of the highest scope of practice at this level within Canada - we have a  pilot PCP expanded scope program, with access to fentanyl, ketamine, versed, ondansetron, etc etc. 
- we utilize zoll-x monitors, power ferno stretchers/ stair chairs & all that other jazz. 

Hope that provides enough information for interested PCPs within the reddit community!

"I suppose that's true.  However, I find it interesting that when the 11 self-governing First Nations in the Yukon negotiated their self-government agreements, they didn't move away substantially from that initial structure.  I guess it ended up working OK?  Old (non-First Nation) government workers told me that in many cases here in the Yukon, the local First Nations individuals didn't have a cohesive sense of themselves as a nation and the first Yukon administrators essentially had to cobble together a nation and get them to agree on a representative so that the government could claim to have had the land ceded by the ""proper"" authorities (in Dene territory - not Tlingit, obviously).  This goes against what I've read by anthropologists, but does seem to corroborate what the old elders (pre-baby boomer era) told me which is that they didn't really have chiefs, just elders that garnered more respect due to being successful so were more likely to be listened to.  It also seems to be reflected in the massive overlaps of affiliation of individuals to local (modern) Yukon nations.

We don't allow citizens of Portugal or of Nigeria, or of Vietnam to vote as Canadians and at this time the First Nations were recognised as not Canadian, but as their own nations.

"I would say it is pretty reliable. I would say there are a few minor disconnects here and there (maybe just my modem) but it is rare for the internet to be down for too long.  I would say maybe a few times a year we have had a longer service interruption but overall I would think it is pretty reasonable. 

Disclaimer - I have lived here for as long as the internet has been available in the Yukon so I might not have as much to compare it to compared to people that have recently moved here. I also don't need the internet for work but for streaming or other things it is generally fine. 

Good luck. Fun place to visit- days are getting longer and lots of good things to explore. It is less accessible with covid restrictions but still lots to see and do and our hospitality sector has been hit hard with covid restrictions and would likely love to host you!

"Aerosol particles are not completely stopped by the most commonly worn masks, the cloth ones or the surgical maths, even when correctly worn (which most are not.) They do however reduce how far they are projected. Yes, they help, but no they don’t eliminate spread. 

The same is true now that we better understand the vaccines. They have reduced the rate of severe illness requiring hospitalization and the rate of death amongst the vaccinated. However, they have clearly not eliminated spread in the way we had all initially hoped. 

Now, given that masks and vaccines are not perfect inhibitors of disease spread there is a legitimate question that can be asked if the social costs of imposing them outweigh their benefit. Most think yes, other not. In a democracy both sides get a say and we should be listening respectfully no matter how absurd we think the arguments. 

There are also wider social questions about our current approach. People have missed funerals. The elderly have died alone. Kids are growing up without social interactions we had. Sports, which are good for mental and physical well-being are cancelled. Businesses are collapsing without customers. Again, it isn’t unfair to ask if we have the balance right in our response. 

Calling people ignorant because they don’t agree with one’s view hasn’t helped. They’ve not suddenly all vaccinated themselves after being called imbeciles. But it has stoked anger and resentment.

"What a wild post. 

1. It's not a choice, and you agree with me. Government mandates are not choices. Yes, governments make other rules too. People agree and disagree with them. Duh. And the white supremacy, lol. So is the anti-protest movement tied to violence, like the Winnipeg driver and Vancouver attackers?

2. Thanks for looking through my comments. But what is your point? The vaccines don't stop the spread (and with Omicron, other than within a short window, don't even significantly limit it). I don't disregard anyone, but I can tell you aren't up on the science.

3. Never mentioned by me, but okay. That's CFR, not IFR, for one. The IFR of Omicron is obviously extremely, extremely low, thanks in part to the great vaccines we have. I think it's a good idea to take them, but I wouldn't force you. Unvaccinated people pose zero threat to me. I think people should be in shape and not obese too, and they'd be less strain on our health system if they were, but I won't force anyone to look after themselves.

"Well, what I was trying to say is that one cannot just state how Covid felt for oneself and then draw any conclusions from that. 

If we want to move the debate forward, such personal observations are pointless. Your observation is just one data-point, and not even a very reliable one. (Nor is mine!) We need to take your observation into account, but then also my observation, and some other person's observation and so on. Then we can sit down together, look at the data, and get closer to understanding what's going on. After that, we submit our thinking to the criticism of others, because we're all fallible. (The idea being that even though we all make mistakes, hopefully, we don't all make the same mistakes; therefore, if others deem our conclusions solid they probably are.) We'll end up with something similar to peer-reviewed research. 

If you can point me to peer-reviewed research that supports your claims (for example, ""its been mild for 99.9% of the planet"") that would be helpful for my understanding. If you cannot, that might be helpful for your own understanding.

We can disagree about what policy decisions to take, based on the facts. And it would be a pretty boring country if we didn't! However, a while ago I read that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but nobody is entitled to their own facts. Couldn't agree more.
