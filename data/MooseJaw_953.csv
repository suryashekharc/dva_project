"Welcome. Don’t let the haters get to you. Moose Jaw is a good little city with lots to offer. If you are looking for family friendly areas, they all are, really. Having said that, east of Main Street and south of Caribou can be a little bit run down in parts and a little bit more on the “low end”.  Northwest - Sunningdale, West Park, VLA, and Palliser Heights areas of town have the most kids by far. South Hill gets a bad rap sometimes, but really, it’s a great part of town as long as you can avoid the Moose Jaw Housing districts. The Avenues west of main and north of Caribou have some lovely old homes. All the schools in the city are great and a new school is going to be built in the South West corner of the city so that area is starting to grow.

"It's a good town, cost of living is less than half of Saskatoon. It's part retirement community, part college town with lots of young people and another large part is working families. There is a military base.  The toughest neighborhood in MJ remind me of Buena Vista or the oldest part of Sutherland. People here complain, but it's tame compared to Saskatoon, Regina or Winnipeg. The nights are very quiet in MJ. Enjoy going to a hot springs regularly as part of living here. 

There's quite a bit of work available across the sectors that exist. I'm not sure precisely what you are looking for with your linguistics major. The book publisher in town folded a couple years ago. Sask Poly has a campus, but not much second language programming that I'm aware of. Tourism is the second largest industry in MJ, agriculture being the first.  

There is a decent sized Fransaskois population here, and several French Immersion schools. The Multicultural Center is busy with language programming if you have that certification. Not sure how much interpreting/translation work there is in town, but definitely many job postings in Regina.

MJ is a commuter city to Regina, as it's an easy 40 minutes on a divided highway. Many people commute to the mines or to Regina for work. There will be lots of carpools. 

The living is easy, has all the amenities, new hospital, good schools. If you have children, where you live in MJ determines what school your kids attend, except French Immersion, so keep that in mind. Different from Saskatoon that way. 

Wakamow Valley is like a little Meewasin that is well used. TONS of birds, beavers, and every kind of animal.  One of the few places in SK to see cliff swallows. 

Buffalo Pound Prov Park is 20 min away. Grasslands National Park is 2 hours away. 

You can still get urbane coffees at Hive, Wildflowers and Mitsu. Wildflowers is a French and gluten free Bistro. There is a vegan bakery in Alternate Root Health Food Store. There is a farm to table grocer called Wandering Market and three independent import candy stores. There's an old time bakery that sells baking for 1980's prices. There is one really old Dairy Queen drive Inn, sort of like the one on 8th Street in Saskatoon, but without as many flavours. I like to go to it and watch people drive ridiculous cars they have made themselves out of three different cars from salvage. 

In Moose Jaw, you will hear someone talk about pro wrestling or about a metal show they went to, or a vehicle they are working on, at least once per day. These same people will ride an electric bike, eat vegan baking, go watch birds, and volunteer for the homeless shelter or foodbank. Moose Jaw is like that - it's too small for people's cliques to not overlap.

"> I feel like you're misreading the articles.
""to ensure that individuals who are required to self-isolate, but who fail to or are unable to, follow the direction of a medical health officer""

I don’t think I’m misreading it. It says people who fail to follow the direction of the officer get put in a camp. 

So imagine the scenario of a single mother with no support who tests positive with no symptoms. Or maybe she had coffee with a positive. 

She goes out to get groceries and gets caught and taken to a camp. Who looks after the kids?

Sask has had 80,000 cases and 914 deaths. That’s a 1% mortality rate. There are 1.2 million people in the province. That means Covid has claimed the lives of .07% of the Sask population. But the pandemic has claimed much more- people’s livelihoods around the world. 

https://dashboard.saskatchewan.ca/health-wellness/covid-19/

So the government has the right to take this woman from her family to a quarantine facility because of the crime of buying food. 

I’m not ok with that. This solution is not the only solution. 

>Regarding Australia, those sites are for places where it is impossible to self isolate as communities are overcrowded and high density.

They are taking people from their homes and putting them in camps. For a virus with a mortality rate comparable to the flu. Yes it is indigenous people at this time. Does that not make it important? And they are building more camps around Australia for this purpose of taking covid positive and close contact people from their homes. 

The costs to people are too great for these measures in my opinion. 

Maybe you don’t think the people in charge will use their new powers as I am describing. Maybe they won’t. What about the next government? Once you give up your bodily autonomy and allow anyone else to make decisions that are your personal right you will never get it back. 

So many people are either brainwashed by the fear news and the rest or for some reason need an authority to tell them what to do. 

Humanity has a contract with each other to stay home when they are sick. Wear masks if sick then, sure. But what is happening has gone too far. 

But maybe everyone in Saskatchewan is down with trashing the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

Or maybe everyone just wants it to be over and are hiding their heads hoping it all goes away.

What policies can he enact to drive change at the Municipal level? I have no doubt he is smart enough to figure out budgets and the process, but we are almost right on top of that.

"- Rent a car one way from the Regina Airport to Moose Jaw, or Google Shuttles from the Airport to Moose Jaw.

- Moose Jaw ain’t that big, but you want to be in the Northwest to be close to Sask Poly. Whatever you do, avoid the Laurier Apartments. Trust me on this one. There are better places. Check Kijiji, or the classified ad section of Discovermoosejaw.com

- Groceries are available at the main locations; Superstore and Walmart are on Thatcher Drive, Safeway and Co-op are downtown. Co-op is great if you buy the $10 membership and don’t mind navigating around every senior citizen in the the city. 

- Public Transit is available to all the shopping areas, but public transit in Moose Jaw is sub-par.

- Depending on the quality of furniture you want to buy there is a Brick Store out by Walmart, and a couple of local furniture stores downtown. Also, check FB marketplace etc. for deals on Furniture. I have no idea if Furnished apartments are even a thing around here.

- Jobs for you and your partner are dependent upon your skills and experience.

Saskatoon is bigger than Moose Jaw but it's still not a big city so one can easily drive from one end to the other in no time at all.

The roads are little rough, and the layout’s confusing at first but you’ll get used to it. I can’t speak for the primary schools here as I’m only here for Computer Engineering. Real estate’s good and utilities are up to date (new water-mains and the first Sask city to implement fibre optic). More recreational facilities are starting to open up (Kinsmen Sportsplex and Yara fitness centre). Now I’ve heard from classmates that the drug problem here is kind of rampant, and I know vandalism’s kind of a big thing around the school, but I’ve never ran into any problems.

"Pros:. The Legion is very active and well supported in Moose Jaw
Many recreation groups to participate in throughout the city for every age.
Low cost of living (New Brunswick levels)
Recreation costs also very low for the level of quality.
Tourism is the second largest industry in town.
There are many families and commuters to Regina, not just seniors.
There is a college in town, so young adults are in town regularly.  
New schools will be built, new neighbourhoods are being built. 
Don't need to shop outside Moose Jaw very often.
A great library.
Two excellent major urban parks.
Going to the mineral pools regularly! The best!
Barely need a winter parka
Long, glorious summer.
Neat history and archaeology.

Cons: Attitude in Moose Jaw favours a lack of change in some circles.
The warm winters and crazy wind make roads and sidewalks icy.  Must buy winter tires for the 3 weeks of proper prairie winter.

"Moose Jaw is a wonderful, if a bit boring city! As someone else here said, its just big enough to have pretty much anything you'd need, while still having the small town feel. The schools here vary a bit at the elementary levels, but the high schools are all really good. Wonderful teachers all around, and the whole city has a good atmosphere for kids. Regina is right nearby for anything else you may need or want to do, and we've got Buffalo pound not far away, as well as Last Mountain lake about an hour and a half away if you'd want to get out of the city for a bit.

"I don't live in Moose Jaw, but living in Regina, I get to Moose Jaw a fair bit and it's really just down the road from us.

It's a quiet city.  It's big enough to have the major amenities but small enough that it still feels like a small town.  The winters are cold, but Moose Jaw gets more of the chinook wind activity than Regina does.  I remember one day one winter when it was 20 degrees in Moose Jaw and +1 in Regina.

You're only 70 km from Regina, so all the ""big city"" amenities (Regina has pretty much all of them; other than Saskatoon, which is slightly bigger, there isn't a bigger city for 600 km).

Nearby are Buffalo Pound Provincial Park (which has some nice cycling trails and a nice lake in a valley), the Qu'Appelle Valley (and all its cottage country plus Last Mountain Lake, about an hour northeast), and the Dirt Hills are southeast, which are a pretty, hilly region with some interesting things like the historic Claybank brick plant which is now a historic site.

I can't comment on schools.  No kids, and wrong city anyway.

As for medical stuff, Moose Jaw has a good hospital and good access to doctors, and again is only 70 km from Regina, which has just about everything.  If something super serious happened, a STAR air ambulance could get you to a hospital in Regina in under half an hour.

You should visit to see for yourself, but I quite like Moose Jaw and I'd be tempted to move there when I retire because it's still near Regina, but the real estate is quite a bit cheaper.",t2_4nrl3,PhotoJim99,0,1612497732.0,0,t1_gm2t74v,gm2t74v,True,[deleted],t3_lcvwmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/moosejaw/comments/lcvwmx/thinking_of_moving_to_moosejaw/,Thinking of moving to Moosejaw,/r/moosejaw/comments/lcvwmx/thinking_of_moving_to_moosejaw/gm2t74v/,13,r/moosejaw,0,13

"If you enjoy physical activity, a good bicycle in the summer is the best way to get around. Even if you were to go from one corner or the city to another, a good cyclist would take at most 45 minutes to make the trip. By car, nowhere is more than 15 minutes on a bad day.  Pick cost and comfort vs. location for your living space. That being said, the east side of the city is the older part, and tends to older homes. South Hill (anything south of the tracks) is slightly newer on the west side, and as you get further west, it's all less than 10 years old.

Depending on your needs, a small car would work, but would have difficulty in the winter as the roads are not cleared really quickly when it snows. You may want to look at an all wheel drive car or SUV. 

If you are looking for social activities, there's lots of various groups to join, several beautiful green spaces and a provincial park less than 20 minutes away with fishing, swimming, camping and a lake. The provincial capitol is Regina and just a short 35 minute drive away. If you are a gamer (pc/board/rpg/etc) give me a shout! We have a very active gaming culture here.

While I wouldn't leave your car or house unlocked, I wouldn't be overly worried about crime.

"Hey! I just moved here about a month ago to teach at the local college (coming from Calgary). I came about a week before total physical isolation started, so I can't speak much to the city itself yet. The rental market here is very slow, so it'll really be the luck of what is on the market. All the one bedrooms I looked at seemed to be pretty rundown and dingy. Was able to find one landlord with a bunch of suites in town that is chill and takes really good care of his places. Happy to share his name if you want to see what he's got available coming up. The best value seems to be if you want to rent a full house, but I know I didn't want to do that because I didn't want to have to fill it with stuff.

As far as location, you'll never be that far from the hospital or anywhere in town, so definitely focus on finding a nice place rather than a place in an area you want to live. Will be tough to meet both criteria.

Hope you luck out and find an awesome place on the market!

"This is dumb, overly simplified, and very spammy (new account, has posted this dozens of times).

You don't need to build 1000 restaurants that take the place of houses.  You build denser housing (for example, apartment buildings with a restaurant in the bottom level).

You don't let people choose what food will be offered.  How the hell would that work?  You'd get 6 people using an app and they'd all choose the same thing every day, or you'd get 50,000 people using the app and they'd all choose something different.  That's how you get Tim Hortons selling hamburgers.  What kind of chef would allow customers to choose the menu?

You don't have a stable source of rental income if there is no stable foot traffic to the location.  You don't have stable personal income if you don't know where you're working the next day, or what customers will visit, or what ingredients you'll purchase or food you'll prepare.

"If you are looking for actual spa treatments (massage, pedicure, etc) I recommend you also check out other nearby spas as they may have better prices or more availability. There are several near Temple Gardens, which is the famous one with the mineral pool and hotel. 

As for what else to do, it depends what time of year you are visiting and what you like to do.

Mac the Moose is pretty famous after the whole Moose War with Norway. It's at Tourism Moose Jaw.  

Moose Jaw has a lot of historical building and interesting architecture, mostly in the downtown core. Any time of year I would recommend a visit to the Grant Hall for a meal or a drink. It's a historic hotel only about a block from Temple Gardens. I has an upscale, early 1900s sort of look but the restaurant is not as expensive as the building would suggest. There are also the murals, you can download a map at [https://moosejaw.ca/murals](https://moosejaw.ca/murals) and I believe Tourism Moose Jaw has hard copies. If you are into art, the Moose Jaw Museum and Art Gallery is quite good as is the Yvette Moore Gallery, which also does a nice lunch. 

There are some interesting shops you can visit along Main St N while you check out the murals and heritage buildings. I personally quite enjoy the aesthetic of the liquor board store at the south end of Main St N as it's a repurposed train station. There is also a mead (honey wine) store that lets you sample the product, including varieties flavoured with local fruits including haskaps and sour cherries.

In the summer, Crescent Park and Wakamow Valley are both lovely to stroll through. You can still visit in the winter, it's just not quite as nice. In the winter there is a skating oval in Wakamow Valley that is free to skate on as long as you have skates. The Wakamow office also loans out snowshoes if you feel adventurous. Crokicurl will be opening soon and should stay open at least to the end of February, or for however long it stays cold enough. It's new location for this season in the Kinsmen Sportsplex. Might be a good idea to call ahead to make sure no one has booked it, especially if it's a weekend.

If you like history or cars/planes/trains, the Western Development Museum is worth a visit. It focuses on the history of transportation. 

Deja Vu is the go-to lunch or supper recommendation. It was featured on You Gotta Eat Here a few years ago.

*While no records exist to confirm why two Indians were chosen, it is reputed that the terra cotta medallions at the base of each of the bridge’s light standards depict images of Bear Ghost and Mike Oka. Research to date suggests that Bear Ghost was a medicine man with Sioux and Assiniboine ancestry and might have been a member of the Moose Jaw band of Sioux, the remnants of Sitting Bull’s followers who camped at Moose Jaw until 1913. Mike Oka might have been a member of the Many Tumors branch of the Blood Indians, a division of the Blackfoot Confederacy, of southern Alberta. His connection to the Moose Jaw area is unknown.

"Gang stalking can be found on urban dictionary, it gives a pretty accurate description of it. You guys should look it up. In my 51 years both me and my wife had never heard of it, until it happened to us in Mississippi and to me in brasil. It’s a really messed up program like that the kgb and stassi ran in the former communist crountries. Counter pro and mk ultra was also used in the us by the fbi. 
It’s fairly far fetched for anyone not in it, but since i’ve Been targeted I’ve Have no choice but believe it since i’m Living it! 
It take away your rights and make you a second class citizen. Your neighbors,family,friends are all either bribed,threatened or lied to to cooperate in destroying the person’s live. Called no touch torture. The target is slander as a phedophile,rapist,violent,mentally deranged. Totally discredited! False investigations are open and officials send warning to the whole community.
They hack all your communications,drugging is used a lot and by of the time they let you see the stalking it’s because they already bought off your inner circle of support.
With so many people struggling now days there are an estimated $1.000.000.000 being spent on this program globally.

How nice of you to say thanks! I can guarantee we all appreciated getting the work! There was quite a crew at Gladding McBean working on the pillars.
