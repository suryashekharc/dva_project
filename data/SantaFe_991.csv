"Yes, it's horrific. Our family isn't native, but we've lived here on the (relatively) cheap for many decades, renting. But things are SO different these last few years, mainly since it became easy to telecommute.

Personally I think that 2nd or 3rd homes should be taxed at a much higher rate.

"This is only part of the issue. Let's take Canyon Road as prime example of this. Families who lived here for generations had to sell because property taxes forced some out. Wasn't feasible or affordable to live in that area for many locals who had lived there for centuries.

"Not so relevant to your interests but the Ukranian Xmas egg shop in the plaza area is really neat! There's another Christmas shop across the street that's also great and has NM ornaments. 

Go try some birria tacos at Fusion Tacos (it's a truck). One of their trucks is well within walking distance of the plaza. Someone else also mentioned Burro Alley; the Mexican restaurant there has a guy that plays piano on Fridays and Saturdays starting at 6. If you're visiting with other people that's a fun time. 

When you do go to Museum Hill, stop by the cafe if you're a coffee drinker. There are a few places around town with good Mexican/Aztec coffee and hot chocolate and that's one of them. The place is sort of like a coffee shop/restaurant combo so don't be thrown off by people sitting around and ordering at tables. Also make sure that you give yourself plenty of time here. Don't think you're gonna spend an hour or so and be done. The folk-art museum takes me forever to go through because it's just too good. 

I would make time to go to the Bandelier National Monument. The murals and everything are just awesome. Don't skip it. If you realize that's your favorite part of the trip so far you might want to go ahead and drive thru the Jemez. and go to the Jemez Historic Site. The whole drive is just gorgeous. With what you wrote I would say Bandelier is probably going to be a favorite.

Madrid is awesome and you should totally go.

"Im no expert, so take my opinions with a grain of salt...but I don't think it's politics.  and Santa Fe doesn't really have an industry...tourism is the driver. I do think the influx of folks bc of covid has for sure affected housing costs. me & SO are transplants from Long Beach, CA. although we purchased our home July 2019, we didn't intend on living here FT for another 5-7 years. but my SO was given 'early retirement' aka fired. it was quite the blow financially so we sold our home LB and moved here FT August 2020.  *but* I was born in ABQ so I feel like I'm coming home. we love Santa Fe. I volunteer as a tutor with SF public schools. I am active with a group that is trying to stop the city from taking back a large parcel of land that was purchased through a bond years ago for a park. they want to sell it to a developer to build single family homes. which of course will raise housing in that area. and also impact the inadequate streets, etc. it's a farce. the city council, well,, let's just say my respect is low..anyway, i take classes at the CC. we shop at the farmers market exclusively during the height of the growing season. we frequent a local co-op and farm (Reunity Resources, awesome veggies!)

all that to say we buy locally as much as possible and try to be good stewards of the fine little city that is Santa Fe.  generally speaking long time residents don't have a favorable opinion  of transplants. I get it but it's practically impossible to stop progress if the local powers that be are driven by, no surprise, money. and apathy is a factor as well

I thought about sumpn else for you to do, have you been to Madrid? (Mad-rid, not Mah-drid) it's an easy drive, again beautiful terrain as you get close to Madrid, which is a funky little hamlet. lots of photo ops. Mine Shaft has the best green chile burger, the speciality with the chile relleno, it's insanely delicious! or stop at Beer Creek brewery and have some good pub grub and yummy local beer. dont blink or you'll miss it!.  if not there, then Santa Fe Brewing, our favorite local brewery. never been a beer drinker until we moved here, all of the local beers are terrific.

"You might also look at Zillow. 

I love Santa Fe and I want to move back. I only haven’t because my kids are happy where we are. That said, there is gang and drug issues in Santa Fe. If the review says shootings, believe it. 

Somewhere online there is a tool that shows crime reports by neighborhood. 

Personally, I really like the Casa Solana neighborhood. It’s a bit mid range on price and very family oriented. The nearby school, Gonzales is a local favorite and people will transfer their kids out of other schools and into Gonzales. 

You might find a Casita on the East Side or Hyde Park road. 

South Capitol is also a great place - again more likely to be a casita than an apartment complex. 

There were some condominiums on Zia that I liked. 

Some of those might be available for rentals. I also love the area around Museum Hill. 

Those areas might be more expensive but less other issues to worry about. 

And you might get lucky with a good deal. 

There are also good rentals all over town. I’ve got friends that live off of Jaguar Drive and they had beautiful safe houses. I’m actually jealous sitting in my expensive California apartment.

Yes that sounds right- SW side of town by Target.

I don't have kids and I'm looking for a 1 bed/studio that's safe but as affordable as possible (which ik will be well over $1000/mo).  I'm 30, female, single, and have spent the past decade in an extremely safe, small city.

All of the large appt complexes I've looked into just have extremely mixed reviews, so it's hard to know what to believe.  San Isidro has many saying it's great to live there and management is wonderful.  Then there are a few that claim diff things like it's not up to code, management is terrible, or the gate is broken so robbery is bad.  One even mentioned shootings.

"Ask if this ""approval fee"" is an application fee (Not the background check fee, which is different). New Mexico does not set a limit on what landlords can charge for an application fee and they are non-refundable.  You're arriving at a time when rents have nearly doubled, if not tripled, here in the last 3 years so landlords are getting away with huge fees.

In any event, contact the city's tenant resources and ask them if you want true guidance.

"If this was the actual billing, the cost of the lineup and improperly marketing the event is why they lost money (mainly the marketing here). Nothing to do with additional camping passes. I’ve run a lot of large scale music festivals, and the break even for a lineup like that would probably be in the ballpark of around 5,000-7,500 3-day passes sold in advance. It doesn’t sound like that many tickets, but it actually is at $300/ticket for a first year festival. Festivals are almost always completely mismanaged in the first year or two. It’s a retiree town, and they booked NWA and Wu-Tang…? The show needed to be advertised nationally, or at least semi-nationally. People will fly in and drive overnight from all over the country for bills like that. Just like any other business, festivals should expect and have accounted for significant losses for the first 4-5 years. It’s very rare for a new festival to turn any profit at all in the first year or two. The first time you break even calls for a champagne toast. 

Camping passes are more often than not just to offset the cost of renting the land and proper licensing.

Look at people like Aldo Leopold and Adolph Bandelier and others who are highly respected by the different people's in the state.

"For sure, I know it's complex. I'm not trying to troll, just thinking big picture. 

Sometimes I just wonder...at what point does someone become ""local""? This could be applied anywhere. The Spanish conquistadors probably weren't considered locals by the Pueblo people centuries ago. Just like the English weren't when they went to conquer Ireland.

All the transplants coming now, if they theoretically stay, would their descendants in 400 years be locals? I would think, but the version of Santa Fe local then could be quite different.

"$1700!!!?  Good grief!
That could buy so MANY books to read from somewhere like Opcit!
Does this include some sort of hotel fee or meal plan?
Might be worth dressing up as a book and protesting outside the event.
Sign ideas anyone? :

“Books not crooks!”

“S Fe Literary Festival- The right to read hasn’t stopped their greed!”

Or set up a table to buy books for kids instead of tickets for book snob festival.

"Honestly I kinda disagree. 

The crazy expensive pass is a ticket to 21 events, including 21 books, multiple provided meals, and multiple Santa Fe excursions, which are probably things as locals we can do on our own time. It's about the same cost as when I go to a conference for work, with the same amount provided. They aren't aiming to be affordable. 

The regular event tickets are $75 with a book included, *and* there's a $25 discount for New Mexico residents. If you don't want the book it's $50. I think $50 to meet an author, listen to a reading, get a signed book and have a conversation or Q&A with them isn't too bad.

Then you have people like the Brown family developing shitty lots off St. Francis Drive that should never be approved just so they can squeeze more money from the municipal government.  Or people like Brant Mackley and Forest Fenn straight up stealing and selling artifacts and sacred items.  Welcome to the capitalist hellscape of America.

"As of 2010 census:

Median age is 40, which I suppose is technically in the 40s. 58% of the total population is 44 or less, but only 47% of the 18 and older crowd (i.e. adults) is under 44. Only 15% of total population is 65 or older, 18.75% of adults.

Sure, numbers for the 2020 census might look different, but in general there's a bunch of misplaced resentment about this here. The numbers here are not actually that different from the demographics of many other places. What is different is that many of the older population moved here from elsewhere, and because of the time period we are in, tend to be baby boom generation people with notably more wealth than the population that was born and remained here. This means that this particular demographic has outsize influence shaping the economics (and to a lesser extent, the politics) than they might do in, say, Philaldephia PA, where there isn't much of a post-50's enhanced-net-worth influx (but still about the same proportion of older people).

It's also a relatively small city (80k people, 150k in the county), so relatively small shifts in demographics, particularly involving the arrival or departure of disposable wealth, can have an outsize effect compared to larger metropolitan areas.",t2_6poup9n6,pauldavisthe1st,0,1647621542.0,0,t1_i167hr6,i167hr6,False,mrsfunkyjunk,t3_th46sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaFe/comments/th46sc/we_came_we_visited_we_ate_a_lot_but_we_have_a/,"We came, we visited, we ate a lot!

"unfortunately SF is sadly lacking in run-of-the-mill thrift stores. as mentioned Double Take is worth a perusal,, make sure you go to the back room through the boot section.. I lived here for 2 years before I realized it existed even though we purchased several furniture items from upstairs.. it's pretty large space but it is a bit pricier than one would expect. 

Thrift For People is only open Saturdays 10-2, has a great mission though. proceeds are used to award small scholarships to minority students. I donate there all the time and always find something to buy when I do. (for example, barely worn Børn suede boots for ten bucks) 

the other place mentioned Ooh La La is near another place called Act 2. (now that I think about it, Thrift for People is also in that area). Act 2 is too jammed for my taste, and I love a good hunt but i have never found anything there. OLL I've never been to. 

Savers is similar to Goodwill or Salvation Army. i always find something there.

Double take has a wide variety of men's and women's clothing at decent prices, a random full price cowboy section, and a second-hand designer section in the back that can be nice.

Ooh lala is second hand designer clothes for women only and has trendy pieces however it is a bit pricier and they are not particularly friendly in my experience.

Saver's is great in terms of a wide variety of men's and women's and prices.

"I moved to SF in ‘75. The Plaza was not atypical for a small town square. It had a drug store with a soda fountain, a Woolworths, a grocery store, and hadn’t transitioned yet into what the Plaza is today. Money came in from Texas and LA back then. Esquire did a cover story on Santa Fe with “Pack Your Bags” on the cover, and we all cringed. 


We rented on the east side for the first 5 years; it was affordable and convenient. We bought a house in town, fixed it up and sold it in ‘81. My daughter was born there. The night life was not bad at all. We danced to good bands at Club West, Casablanca in the La Fonda hotel, the Senate Lounge (sort of a gay bar, as I recall). In the summer we went to Santa Fe Downs and bet on the nags. In some ways, Santa Fe felt like a private playground then because nothing was crowded, or that expensive.
