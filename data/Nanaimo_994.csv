"The crazy thing is paper bags aren't even clearly better than plastic bags environmentally. Creating them takes slightly more energy, 4x as much water, and creates 3x as many green house gases per bag after factoring in how much more difficult they are to transport in bulk.

Cloth bags also have their own issues, especially in terms of sanitation, and need to be used around 170 times to be on par with even single-use plastic bags in terms of CO2.

"The amount of plastic waste in everyday packaging is the problem but instead of tackle that problem they banned the one bit of plastic that was reused by most households. If this was anything other than optics the fast food industry would be held to account. Just as an example before McDonalds had McCafe the juice with breakfast came in the standard paper cup (once used can be disposed of in compost bin) now it comes in a plastic cup. Timmy's new lids appear to use twice the plastic as the old ones. Due to pandemic no one was or is letting you hand them a reusable cup yet one can still eat at a restaurant and the server take away your used plates and cups. 

On another note as regional governments try to reduce plastics by banning them in a rather spotty manner the feds have legalized cannabis with packaging requirements that pretty much eliminate any gains made in reducing plastic waste/use.

This part is my opinion: Personally, I would’ve considered it reclaimed land and therefore real property now. Not to say someone new could just reclaim more coastline… it’s not like the tide comes up and fills the pool… In the 40s, if they had extended out a putting green like that, would that be considered real property now or also foreshore.

However.... bylaw is 100% complaint driven. Its not a problem until someone from the public complains.   


The only way I can see to ""grandfather"" you current front yard fence would be to slowly replace it in sections. You could maybe get away with it by saying you didn't replace the old fence but instead just ""fixed"" the existing 6' fence.   


Side note....I read a story about a family in victoria who had an ocean front house with an old pool built out into the tide line. They were allowed to keep it as long as they wanted but were not allowed to work on/repair it. When it got old and fell apart... oh well. It was kinda grandfathered in.. kinda not lol

That area is a frequent camping spot for homeless, though. Someone from the mobile home park yelled at me for being up there, exploring and taking photos.

It appears to have been demolished decades ago but there's enough rubble to poke around in to determine that something used to be there, as Pine St. used to connect through the area.

"The ground slopes anyways. From the road, the fence is only 4, maybe 4.5’ but 6’ on the inside. It’s kind of annoying cause from the road it feels like a ditch, so it’s hard to maintain. Want to fill it in anyways. It’s not a ditch for drainage fyi, just awkward grading. I was hoping to have a retaining wall on the inside for a raised bed and at least have the grade even from the sidewalk… or build a retaining wall along the sidewalk to raise it a bit extra too and then the raised bed on the und side would be a little extra also. Would only be a couple of feet. Someone else has a retaining wall along the sidewalk further up the rd. But I think the fence is still short. Ideally, I’d rebuilt the fence so it has insulation properties. Either have rubber tacked on the inside and then made discrete with faux vines or do a concrete fence like you say.

BUT! Will anyone care? Bylaw enforcement is usually complaint driven. At my old house in Brechin my front fence extended about 8 feet into city property and no one said a thing.

It’s completely outrageous that we can’t get health care! 

I’m not an expert but a lot of posts on r/Vancouver talking about low pay is per patient for GPs compared to specialists and even NPs (!) and the insane bureaucracy (relative to other provinces and definitely to US) being the cause. 

I wrote my MLA ( Malcolmson) in 2020 to ask why the other walk in clinics were shut “because of Covid” (which seems like a ruse since other drs offices were open) and why there was such a shortage in GPs—and she told me the solution was coming because there was going to be a new med school opening .
No clue how that’s going to fix our retention problem (even after 10 years or whatever it takes for the first to graduate from this new school). They’ll just graduate and move to ON AB, US, or become dermatologists.

"'Cuz it's a free country, and I like the way it is, so do millions of other Canadians. If you -dont- like democracy, you're free to find some communist country that'll be more than happy to Lead you-- I mean, have you. 

""F*ck trudeau"" is no worse than any other stupid thing people on both sides have done and said throughout history about politicians they didn't like.

And it was their right to do so and say those things, because its a democratic country. Are you starting to see how that circles back? There's a difference between encouraging people to be civil and say the right things, and outright censoring them just to make someone else feel better.

You don't have to stick around, or look at stuff that offends you, or participate in things you don't like, or be around people you don't like or who dont like you.

"I experienced same thing out in errington in 2017. My woman felt vibrations then  the sound i heard sound and 10 months later felt the vibration. If you can in the dead of night when you can hear sound clearly record the sound with your phoneusing a spectrum analyzer. Learn how to filter the graph so you tecognize thesound on agraph and google the Mhz range you sus the sound to be. Wanna prove vibrations? Depending on strength i had black dinnerplates sprinkled with salt left on the floor and dont interfere with the vibes. So no laundry music kids running around and see if the salt formsor groupstwardsthe center of theplates. I also had necklaces suspended from the ceiling and watch them moveslightly or just dangle dead. Or in a weird experiment for myself i places my bobleheads collection arounnd the place and using spare older phonesi timlapse recorded them over a 1 hour period.. They all worked and the sound was narrowed down to abad bearing from agravel pit rock crusher 2km away but not the vibration. The vibes fell smack dap into a toronto news story where a cul de sac was experiencing similar phenomena. I figured out what was going on andpromptly dropped all experimenting. Lets just say that if you have need for alarge amount of power generators but you forgot to not only bolt them to the floor, but also to the wall , they will harmonically cause a sympathetic vibration that can be felt for quiet aways even if they are .....underground?.......ya..the sound was from who knows how many genies all running.together. thats my adventure in spectrum analysis vibes and sounds continuously running 24/7.

"IMO:

Quarterway is a vibe on Karaoke nights. More of a neighbourhood bar/pub; ie., more of a lowkey “grab a cold one with the crew” vibe rather than a “night on the town vibe.”

Old City was the pre-clubbing spot before Covid… but is now the end game clubbing spot. Basically, the same people you would’ve seen at Level 2. Lots of VIU students to be found here. Drunk, loud, and wild is the vibe.

Terminal is everything you want in a classic bar - cool building, pool table, darts, etc. but for some reason no one goes there… so it’s not a ‘bumpin’ place, but you are bound to meet cool people and have more interesting and meaningful connections.

Carlos is for birthdays, ponchos, and what used to be a really great appy hour special... It’s alright for a bite & drink and dip before going to where you actually wanna go. More social house vibes than bar vibes. Actually, pretty nice in the summer with the outdoor seating and ocean views.

"A bit ironic that RCMP spokesperson O'Brien qualifies the crime as ""brazen"", when his colleague Josh Grafton, who had been deemed ""fit for duty"" by the RCMP in 2020 (after getting charged criminally 3 times), recently had a report published about him, declaring him definitely unfit for duty:

[https://www.crcc-ccetp.gc.ca/en/final-report-following-public-interest-investigation-arrest-b?=undefined&wbdisable=true](https://www.crcc-ccetp.gc.ca/en/final-report-following-public-interest-investigation-arrest-b?=undefined&wbdisable=true)

The RCMP knew that Grafton was unfit for duty, since 2015 at least.  Grafton is a repeat offender sociopath, on trial for 3 criminal charges against him, and 3 civil suits.

Is it not ""brazen"" for Nanaimo RCMP command to have lied about Grafton being fit for duty, for 2 years? - placing our community at risk in the process?

For more information about the Josh Grafton scandal, you can see my post from 2 years ago:

Again, the key word you keep choosing to ignore is “reduce” 

They are kids, they need to be taught how to self govern 

The act of telling them “No” instills defiance. Not the law, so create an environment where they are told “Yes” because the specific conditions allow for a “Yes” and it will REDUCE the amount of kids going out and vandalizing neighbourhoods  

The structured environment will provide them with an option and options teach self governance. Because options make them ask questions about themselves, even if it’s subconsciously 

There are still natural born anarchists, that will do what ever they want. Regardless of consequence

As someone who actually grew up around kids like this, I can promise you none of the ones I ever met were doing anything other than purposefully vandalizing someones property with their ""tag"" to do anything other than mark gang territory or just as an act of rebellion to get a rush.

"Diesel was 227.9 in a cheaper part of the island last night.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I drive a gasser, but that's a huge number for that crowd...they only get good milage if you are towing something heavy a long distance. That's what diesels are best used for.

To warm a diesel up in winter to drive 5 mins for smoke at $2.30/L is nuts.

I wonder, will gas ever, EVER, go down to anywhere near $1.50? again? Probably not.

This should be the catalyst for our country to become reasonably resource self sufficient.

We should have had a rational plan in place, selling only enough oilsands' crude to build a refinery to say, 75%, perhaps could have partnered with private industry for the remainder?

Instead we've been ruining our environment to almost give the resources away, mostly to the Americans, but we don't care really. We just want to sell it cheap yesterday...fuck our future generations.

I know this has turned into a bit of rant🤭...it just didn't need to be this way for us here in Canada. 
Little Norway has done a lot of things right, comparitavely to us. Their sovereign wealth fund certainly isn't little compared to ours, it's huge.

They have been rather responsible for the last 40 years while we have not...it's impressive considering how little oil and gas they really have.

"My wife is taking the care aid (HCA) program right now actually. She is doing it through VIU. It's mon-wed 9-1 on zoom (1-3 is ""homework time"") with the school then works 2 regular 8 hr works days at the care home thursday-friday. They (government) has 100% paid for all her schooling and actually pays her her regular work wage while she attends school. Its a pretty sweet deal they are offering. I guess there is a HUGE demand for hca's. The only catch is you have to work at your care home for 1yr after then program ends of you owe it all back. after the 1yrs though your free to go to a diferant employer or leave the profession all together.

If the schooling thing isnt for you.....She started at this care home in Dietary. As far as I know... that was basically plating up food for the HCA's to take to the residents and then cleaning up the dish's/tables once meal time was over. She started at like $22 an hr I think? medical/dental after 3 months. It was officially a ""casual"" position to start but I think by week 2 she was full time.

My advice is to see if you can find current or ex students of any course, to ask them questions about how valuable they found the course. Also if you think something would be interesting see if you can talk to someone in the industry and get a feel for what it's actually like, I spent too much money on a career I didn't actually end up liking so I'd warn you to try talk to current workers in it to see what it's actually like before sinking any money into it.

"Also true, just changing huge diapers full of urine and feces and putting my fingers all the way up a 80 year Olds poo filled butthole for suppositories every morning, while being run ragged and short staffed constantly, and treated very poorly by nursing staff, and working with other care aides who were very nasty, was not it for me. 


But if someone wants to do that, totally up to them.


 It is a very hard job and underappreciated, screwed up my back and shoulder forever. 

I do hope working conditions have improved and not having to pay for the course is a bonus but I'd never do it in a million years unless major reforms were made to the Provincial Health Care system AND to the standards for privatization of care, as many care homes are privately owner and for-profit, sacrificing the health of the residents and staff constantly. 

I got Norwalk twice in 2 years due to management not caring at all about infection control in care homes. Many others I know got terrible illnesses like C Dif as well for the same reasons.  

Also dementia residents were notoriously difficult and myself as well as many other care aides were frequently physically assaulted and subjected to disgusting conditions such as feces thrown at them or strewn about rooms, or old food, hoarded diapers, vomit, etc. (and no, housekeeping doesn't come in those instances, so not only are you providing care to people, but also cleaning up disgusting biohazards with no help and poor equipment)

If this person is looking for relief from shitty working conditions in retail, a care aide position is out of the frying pan into the fire *in my opinion*

Right as you get to the park from the parking lot, there's paved trails. So you can do straight, gentle curves, and sharper turns as you get comfortable.
A lot of the trails go beside grass, so if you need to bail, you can just aim for the grass for a softer landing.

"These are all great suggestions and definitely things I would have said!

If you like breweries there are some nice ones across the street from Maffeo Sutton park, namely White Sails and Cliffside. Downtown there are some decent restaurants, like Gabriel's Cafe, Melange, Asteras Greek, La Trattoria.

There are some beautiful trails just south of Nanaimo in Cedar: Jack Point and Cable Bay. There's a great authentic English pub in Cedar called Crow and Gate that's worth going to. 

South a bit more is Ladysmith (20 minute drive), which is a cute and quaint town with some good restaurants and shops to check out. 

You can take a short ferry to Gabriola Island and there are some beautiful spots including these rock formations, called Malaspina Gardens I believe.

You can also take a trip north to Parksville (25 minute drive): there are two beautiful sandy beaches (Parksville beach and Rathtrevor). There's also two mini golf companies that are both great.

Parking is free for the first 3 hours (you still need to get a slip thingy, though), and it's pretty cheap for longer.  
There's public washrooms if you need that.  
Usually a food truck of some kind on nice days and weekends.  
There's a playground, if you have kids.  
An artificial beach.  
A few trails in the park, and a bridge that leads over the lagoon. You can swim there, but it's a bit cold.  
There's a pier where you can watch the sea planes take off and land. People often fish for crabs there.  
Then you can take the boardwalk to the south of that, which takes you along a few touristy type shops, a couple of icecream places, a coffee shop, restaurant, boat docks, etc.  
It's all pretty intuitive once you park your car, so don't worry too much about directions if that's as far as you're going.

If you're still into walking, once you get to the end of the trail, you can either head up Front St to check out the Bastion (wood tower built in the 1800s), or cross and go up Museum Way.
If you go the Bastion way, then either stick to that side of the road and take some of the stairs back down to the board walk, or cross the street to meet up at Commercial where there's more shops. You'll end up about half way up the street.  
If you go Museum way, you'll start at one end of Commercial, and can just work your way north.  
There's a cool used bookstock just across the street from Museum way once you get to the end of the cobblestone. There's also Gabriel's Cafe which has a lot of locally sourced, organic, etc. food. Good place to stop for a bite if you're hungry at that point.

That's probably the best, day-outing route to take if you've not been here before.

There's a few other places you can go, but wouldn't take as long to go through them.  
[The Old City Quarter](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Old+City+Quarter/@49.1651059,-123.9418118,18z/data=!3m1!5s0x5488a3e25c6ccc73:0x521f2c2a86cf8382!4m5!3m4!1s0x5488a3e27e8f6c11:0x495f2f383dc75e18!8m2!3d49.165509!4d-123.9418931) is smaller, but has some cool unique shops, and the Waffle Magic place is awesome if you're looking for something sweet and filling.  
There's a new-age type store there too, which has some interesting things, if you're into crystals and stuff like that.

You could also check out [Departure Bay Beach](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Departure+Bay+Beach/@49.2048908,-123.9699977,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x5488a191882d0297:0x11e3c42b19b36200!8m2!3d49.2050316!4d-123.9690513) if you're wanting to just chill out on a sandy beach. There's a coffee shop across the street and often food trucks on nice days.

If you're looking for more nature and less people, then you can try [Piper's Lagoon](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Pipers+Lagoon+Park/@49.226955,-123.957844,14.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x5488a1ce5e2aa1eb:0xc4bd45ce2a2e7c54!8m2!3d49.2228804!4d-123.9483316) which has a long gravel path, to walk along. It's a good place to see ferries come in. Great in a storm, if you like watching waves and getting pelted by rain.  
At the end of the gravel path, you can climb up the rocks on the right to get a higher up view (there's benches to sit on), or over the rocks on the left to access the rest of the park, which is more nature trail like. At low tide, you can even walk across to Shack Island, but make sure you get back before the tide comes back in.

And if more (easy) nature trails are your thing, [Neck Point](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Neck+Point+Park+parking+lot/@49.226955,-123.957844,14.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x5488a1d7b5f03f71:0xa7273cb2859b34a8!8m2!3d49.2330971!4d-123.9651416) is a good place to go.  
There's maps, so it's hard to get lost, and lots of trails that cross each other, but still has both wooded trails and beach adjacent trails to walk on. This is probably the best place to go if you're looking for a chance to see whales/orcas and seals, if they happen to be in the area at the time.  
If you have kids, I'd suggest taking the trail from behind the outhouse in the parking lot. There's fairy doors to find, and couple of them open with (usually) toys inside for kids to take.",t2_5ay3v,meoka2368,0,1646679036.0,0,t1_hzqixbo,hzqixbo,True,XmanORE,t3_t8vgax,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanaimo/comments/t8vgax/things_to_do_inaround_nanaimo/,Things to do in/around Nanaimo?,/r/nanaimo/comments/t8vgax/things_to_do_inaround_nanaimo/hzqixbo/,25,r/nanaimo,1,25

"If its that big of a concern download  the gas app and start playing gas station musical chairs.

"Ehh penny pinching gas is kinda penny wise pound foolish

1. Youd have to make more back then your extra kilometres would cost in gas, if your only doing a half tank or less, your likely saving maybe a 1$ at most going out of your way in most instances.

2. you dont value your time, most cases for me to save a couple extra cents id have to drive to a gas station half way across town from my house or make a detour after work, which I dont always like doing, Probably taking 20-30 minutes of my times. 

3. There has to be a large price difference, which historically isnt normal, 90% its maybe a few cents difference. Getting 40 litres saving 3c per litres is only a savings of 1.20$ dollars, a full tank maybe 2.50$. 

Tl;dr youd probably save more money not buying coffee a few times a month or making it at home then caring about which gas station to get gas from.",t2_i8yvg399,ehdif3485,0,1646436926.0,0,t1_hzdtkqb,hzdtkqb,False,Izanami358,t3_t654p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanaimo/comments/t654p9/why_are_gas_prices_much_cheaper_here_than_on_the/,Why are gas prices much cheaper here than on the Mainland and Victoria?,/r/nanaimo/comments/t654p9/why_are_gas_prices_much_cheaper_here_than_on_the/hzdtkqb/,2,r/nanaimo,0,2

"Like the above person said, most of us can be functional while being a daily drug user. 

Most homeless people had shit like getting raped for a long time at a young age and unlikely to get proper treatment in foster care to cope with it and turn to drugs/alcohol in their teens/early adults, So fuck em I guess? 

And the other many lot have various mental/physical conditions. Try living on disability income and barely being able to do things for your self and then add on being in 6+/10 constant pain every day and not developping an addiction to pain killers or alcohol to numb the pain. Good fucking luck. Seriously. Our system for disabled people literally breeds homelessness. If you cant work, your basically homelessness unless you can get someone to cut you a sweet deal. Disability income literally is barely enough for rent alone. 

Very few homeless are doing so because they genuinely want to be there, no mental health problems no physical problems and lived and a relatively regular childhood. Drugs are good way to forget your outside on a bench in the cold, in what is likely a very uncomfortable position. Doing it sober aint easy.

Next time you see a homeless person maybe think that the reason their doing heroin is because their dad used to rape them until their ass bled several times a week when they were 7 years old and threatened to beat or do it your sister/brother if you said anything.

Or their mother used to beat them every day, and go into obscene alcoholic fits where they would see and hear their parents get into extreme violent fights where the cops would get involved on a weekly basis.

Or maybe their father was prostituting them at the age of 9 to sick fucks so he could buy some more meth.

T'other day I observed 200-plus seagulls land in a big grassy field. At first it seemed they were walking around randomly while pecking up worms, which seemed unnaturally abundant, but then I began to discern patterns. Geometry dictated what I was seeing. Due to the confined space and each bird's 'personal bubble' of 1 meter, I could see the whole mass was revolving, clockwise, with occasional spokes radiating from the center. Each seagull had its own lane this way. After a while the gluttons in the center stopped still, preened for about 10 minutes and took off while new seagulls arrived at the outer rings. Then the pecking diminished, though they kept walking and hunting for a bit before all flying away. The worms had given up on holding a jamboree on the surface that day.

"I believe in you! It's hard sometimes but one trick you can use is to pretend you're talking to your loved one, like a husband or wife.

Let's say you love your wife and she asks you your opinion on her blouse. Most would agree that telling her ""your blouse is pathetic""... probably won't make her feel very loved. In fact, it would probably do the opposite. It would make her feel uncared for. Because the fact is, you didn't have to focus on the negative, but you chose to anyway. When you say ""pathetic"" as your only statement that you contribute to someone else, it makes it sound like there is zero redeeming qualities. Your wife's blouse may actually be really awful looking but that doesn't mean she has no redeeming qualities.

Instead, you could have said to your wife ""I've got some ideas for blouses that will bring your style to the next level!"".  Lift her up.

The bus I take fills up completely.
