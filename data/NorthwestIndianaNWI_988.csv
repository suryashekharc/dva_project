"Go buy one for like $200-$300 (used) 300-500(new) and shoot some rounds at point blank. You will get it in a few. Super easy. Easiest guns to shoot.

Or a mossburg 500. Very good cheap pump.

I really think one of these two should be everyone’s first gun, they can be modified cheaply and easily by you to be used for Home Defense, bird hunting, turkey hunting and large game like deer.

"Depends on the area of Porter you live in...  Porter has the beach front.  Porter's houshold median income is 20% more than people in Chesterton. More people own homes in Porter than in Chesterton.

"No clue how they plan on orchestrating all of this - seems like a logistical nightmare. I hope there is something in place for lower income individuals and families. It's going up from free (other than West Beach) to person/walk-in/bike-in/boat-in rate: $15.00 (up to a maximum of $25 per family), Motorcycle Pass: $20.00, One to Seven-Day Vehicle Pass: $25.00, Indiana Dunes National Park Annual Pass: $45.00 and Commercial Fee for a Motor Coach (Bus): up to $100.00.

Adding a copy and paste (edit) from another comment I made on another thread - I'm personally not worried about the cost, and I support that the revenue will help the park system. I was more curious how this would all map out and be handled \ enforced. West Beach for example has a gate at the main entrance, just like the State Park, so you pay your fee and you come in - that makes sense in my head. The Indiana National Park is not continuous though, it's broken up into multiple chunks and has a lot of small lots that I can't imagine would be cost efficient to put gates \ attendees at. Bases on comments, the FAQ, calling the info line, and just dwelling on it I think they are going to sell parking passes, and adjust the fee at West Beach.

"Are you in the city proper? I grew up in Center Township, about a mile past the fairgrounds, and plow trucks were always way behind because they were county trucks. My dad crashed his truck going up Buck Hill one time because someone coming down the hill lost control and hit him head on. I once crashed my car twice in one night coming home from Merrillville. My answer was to move to the city for 23 years because at least they plowed, or I could take public transportation. Out here you should plan to not need to go anywhere if it snows. It's just how it is. Or get all wheel drive and/or snow tires and not worry about snow on the roads.

I live in Highland and when I woke up we had a single lane plowed in the middle of the side streets in my subdivision, but the plows are back and doing the whole street now that the snow has tapered off. On the flipside of this is my cousin who lives in Jefferson Township south of Valpo. You expect to be stuck for awhile, which is how he learned to stock up ahead of time and owns two Jeeps.

"East Chicago has a ton of trains in and out and the ride is relatively short. However the lot is huge and even with the expansion, it can be hard to find parking, especially during the week. You're also leaving your car in the middle of East Chicago which can freak some people out.

If you're coming from the east or taking 421 up, then Michigan City is probably the next obvious choice as it's the starting/stopping point for most trains (especially the ones not specifically aimed at NWI commuters). There's only the one station in Michigan City right now (Carroll Ave). There is usually enough parking but the overflow lot can be confusing to figure out and isn't exactly at the station. There's also the fact that you'd be leaving your car in Michigan City.

If you're taking 65 up, you'll probably end up on 94 which will put you right near the downtown Gary stop. If you continue a little further west on 94, you'll end up passing by Hammond which has a South Shore stop and may be your best bet for relative car safety and schedule flexibility. Lot can get FULL though thanks to the amount of daily commuters though.

Beverly Shores and Portage/Ogden Dunes are stops between Michigan City and Gary that tend to be fairly quiet.

Michigan City to Millennium Station is about 2 hours one-way. East Chicago to Millennium is about 30-40ish minutes one-way. Fares vary based on where you start and stop.

Metra doesn't really start until you cross over into Illinois so South Shore is probably your best bet. I'd also look into downloading the South Shore app on your phone if you've got a smart phone. It's free and it's usually a lot easier to figure out than the paper schedules you can get at stations.",t2_3cblxq7,DoYouWannaB,0,1642396028.0,0,t1_ht03a9x,ht03a9x,True,emmipod,t3_s5usq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nwi/comments/s5usq1/best_park_and_ride_train_to_chicago/,Best Park and Ride train to Chicago?,/r/nwi/comments/s5usq1/best_park_and_ride_train_to_chicago/ht03a9x/,9,r/nwi,0,9

My mom has a friend that goes to a different fish fry every week during Lent around the Griffith area and hasn't found a bad one yet. 

St. Mary in Griffith does a perch dinner with baked potato or fries, side of cottage cheese or cole slaw, bread and a small dessert. It think it was $11 last year, you call your order in and pick up curbside, or at least that was how they did it last year. I tried to stab my husband for trying to dip into my perch last year.

I prefer winters here (I'll take cold snow over depressing gray skies lasting months)

More things to see & do aren't as spread out here. Large cities are closer together.

The Oregon of the 21st century is definitely not the Oregon of my childhood and early adulthood.

I like history and this part of the country has more of it and I like learning it. Maybe not more history but more is documented.

I'm still discovering the area. I lived in Oregon for more than 35 years so I feel I saw everything I was going to see. I love exploring and I feel like I'll never see everything there is to see.

"It's not the same but I still enjoy life here. I would put the Porter \ LaPorte County lakefront communities as one of the closest places I've discovered that's anywhere similar to the PNW. Your primary white collar job hub is going to be Chicago. There's a (slow) light rail system (South Shore) that runs from NWI into downtown Chi. You've got nature out here that can rival the PNW, but NOWHERE near the scale that you have available in PNW. Also, it's pretty much flat as a pancake out here. Things aren't as free here either. When I think of the PNW I think of forests and beaches with fire pits and dogs running free and open containers and surfers.... There are pockets, but that doesn't typically fly here unless you're on ""private"" beachfront. No real surfing due to no Coastal reefs. Weed is legal in MI and IL, but not in IN.

"If you are moving to NWI, the time is right now. There are three new train stations being built in Hammond, Munster, and Dyer that will go directly to downtown Chicago’s Millennium Station. They are supposed to be up and running within the next three years. 


Once those stations are here, lots of people are going to choose to work in Chicago but live in NWI for the inexpensive cost of living as well as more room to raise children.


EDIT: More info can be found below. If you are planning on buying a house or land, values are only going to go up once the trains start operating in mid 2025.

"The may have changed their name from Porter Memorial, but the shit is the same.    About ten years ago I had to have a stent removed due to a kidney stone.  A few hours afterwards the pain was incredibly intense.  My now wife came home and found me curled up on the floor.  They take me to Porter.  
  The nurses and doctor are there.  He asks what they normally give me for the pain and I say morphine or Demerol.  He says give him 2mg of dilauded and leaves.  The nurse, Kendra, says “that’s too much.  I’ll give him half.”  They had to use an infants IV needle because I was massively dehydrated.  
  As soon as they injected me with that stuff I could not lift my arms, legs, head and barely talk.  Could not open my eyes. The pain remained though.  I almost stopped breathing.  The nurse gets something to reverse it.  If you ever see the movies where someone gasps and comes back, that’s what happened.  
  I had an allergic reaction to that stuff.  If the nurse hadn’t cut the dose in half I wouldn’t be here.

"Lived in Portage coming up on 20 years now. It's a good starter place to live. Not a lot of crime. I had an apartment broken into by the maintenance staff, and my car broken into by a kid in the section 8 apartments that were right next to our apartment complex. In our current neighborhood, my kid's bike was ganked from the side of the house, but an eagle eyed neighbor gave us the information to get it back. Very inexpensive taxes, likely due to no public resources that actually cost tax dollars to operate.

That being said, there's nothing here. Nothing to do, no community events. Restaurants are either chain or really shitty. Crappy school system(ranked last in the county). Park department does nothing to keep up the parks system, and the main local parks have shrunk down to half size due to overgrowth. The nicer parks with new the new soccer fields are gated and locked.

Our kid is going off to college next year, and we're moving to Valpo. They actually have great restaurants and strong community events/festivals including a thriving local music scene. There's a solid downtown area where you can park and just walk around until you find something to do. There is no downtown area in Portage. Just a department store strip of parking lots.

So yeah, for the price Portage isn't bad at all. But you do get what you pay for, which in Portage is nothing... You'll get a warm place to sleep and a school system that usually meets the bare minimum for accreditation.

"Portage is practically a restaurant desert if you want anything outside of pizza, Mexican, Chinese, or chain foods, but surrounding cities have plenty and the place isn't *bad*. Crime isn't bad at all - not perfect, but I've never felt unsafe there. The downtown area is coming along and the city is at least making an effort to improve - obviously it could go either way, but it seems to be getting better. The Lakefront and Riverwalk is a nice place to wander to on a weekday, although the bordering steel mills can make it hit or miss (although that applies to pretty much any natural area in the region.)

Hobart's got a few good food places (Librarium is a cool spot with some good food), but it's about the same city-wise, outside of being slightly further from the lake.

If I had the choice, I'd probably choose Chesterton over either (although if I were moving, I'd go to another state), but neither are a *bad* choice if you're stuck to those two choices.",t2_1ekf3,coheedcollapse,0,1639863144.0,0,t1_hp3dlpk,hp3dlpk,True,[deleted],t3_rj9gxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nwi/comments/rj9gxq/is_hobartportage_a_bad_area_to_live/,Is Hobart/portage a bad area to live?,/r/nwi/comments/rj9gxq/is_hobartportage_a_bad_area_to_live/hp3dlpk/,3,r/nwi,0,3

"I've been following the Marquette Greenway stuff as close as I've been able to (info is hard to come by at times and has been changing). There used to be 3 stages in Burns Harbor, but I'm pretty sure there's only two now (originally there was another scenic route but I think that got scrapped). The first part that's already completed (as you mentioned) goes from 149 and heads West. It ends in the middle of the woods about a mile short of Bass Pro (Burns Harbor \ Portage border). I've heard that in April Portage is picking up where Burns Harbor left off and will tie into the bike path around the industrial complex where Bass Pro is. That's supposed to connect up to the Portage lakefront, and go through Ogden Dunes (Ogden Dunes has been throwing a fit) and connect to Miller. Going in the other direction, Burns Harbor will be picking up on the East side of 149, heading towards the National Park. National Park will then be responsible to continue the path from Burns Harbor and spit out somewhere on Howe Road near Bailey \ Field Station. I've heard that instead of paving the Calumet Trail, they are going to pour an entire new path, leaving the existing Calumet Trail as a utility access road for Nipsco. Mich City has been actively pouring more path picking up where the Calumet Trail ends on 12 and continuing up past Shoreline Brewery and towards the Casino. I was expecting another decade or two for it all to be done but that Fed money should help astronomically. If I had to guess, National Park will probably be dragging their heels. Currently you can take Beam St North and cross 20. It turns into a gravel road where you can cross some railroad tracks and it will put you in Burns Harbor on N Babcock Rd (behind Worthington Steel).

"You mention all solid places, but none of them tend to stick in my head as rocking experiences that bring me back to Valpo on a regular basis. I'm being a totally unfair stereotyper here but I think Bon Femme was a good representation of Valpo. It opened up as a second location, original was in Merrillville. The original was a mishmash, nothing matched, all of the under aged servers where drunk off wine, but it was fn epic, everytime I went. The Valpo location tried to polish itself up and come off as more ""fine dining"" and it never lived up. It's like they put all of their ""soul"" points into ""image"". Again, I know I'm being unfair about it and lumping a lot of places together unfairly. If I lived in Valpo (especially within walking distance from the square) I'm sure I would be happy with the options and variety but having to consciously make the decision, I'm never like, ya, we should go deal with Valpo.

The winters seemed to fluctuate in both places, with big storms happening every so often -- we had some crazy ice storms/tons of snow in NWI some winters, and others not too bad (so far this year). The very first year I moved to Boston there was a crazy winter Nor'easter, but then the winters after that were mild. I don't remember having a lot of the extreme polar vortexes where temperatures plunge so much in Boston, though.

"The worst part is not the cold as much as the roads. (We get the same winds as downtown Chicago) Even on a night where there isn't a lot of snow etc can have pretty bad black ice on back roads or bad snow drift. Sometimes we do have storms bad enough to close everything down for a few days, I would say that has happened maybe 4-5 times in the last 20 years. In the last 30 years we have had only about 2 real blizzards that got pretty bad. Not likely to happen much anymore. Everywhere can get pretty congested with expansion near downtown or on main roads. Bad accidents happen every bad snow fall on these roads

It is one of the nicest areas of the country in my opinion but I was born here. I'm personally about to take a break because of the winters but I want to come back eventually. The people have ranged from Midwest friendly to more introverted lately. But a lot of these towns are going through major changes and expansion so it might be a great time to be a part of that. Or it might not if that's not your thing. Sometimes we seem to be a battleground for cultural issues, with people standing on our squares ranting their particular rhetoric (usually not at each other luckily). The good news is that you'll find more and more small town events and communal aspects as things grow and everything should even out in due time! If you're looking for night life or aspects of the city that you've always loved like public transport commutes not much of that though besides maybe in Valpo or closer to Michigan City. A lot of good restaurants and dive bars

From your comments it looks like you are looking at Cedar Lake. A lot of my best friends grew up there and I have spent a lot of time there. It's a nice community for what it is worth but has a patchy history if you have not looked into that. Also weird crime is more common here than Crown Point or Lowell usually just of a property crime nature closer to the lake. Although it is another one that is growing and changing and will probably be a lot like Crown Point in the future. That's where I suggest to be honest but I am biased. Many nice families here with good morals and respect for others, and some jerks too but hey that's everywhere! But some great people here I have made life long friends with. 

To be more specific look at the Lakes of the Four Seasons, where I grew up and a couple of the newer communities in Saint John. LOFS was kinda like growing up in Stand By Me haha in a good way.

"Maybe I'm missing something but Porter is totally different than Gary and Hammond (not trying to bash on either). We're a town of around 5000 and around 1/3+ of the area is protected park - we do have a lot of trains though =-). Not sure if you have kids or not, but if you do, I would look at school districts to help narrow down your area. Chesterton used to be an open district but that's recently changed for folks outside of Duneland (Burns Harbor, Chesterton, and Porter). A lot of folks from the beachfront communities (Miller, Ogden Dunes, and Beverly Shores) used to send their kids into Duneland schools, but that option has been closed (there are a few loopholes, like if you send your kids to St Pats they can still go to Chesterton regardless of where you live). There are plenty of rural-esque properties scattered all throughout NWI. Not sure about the highway expansion, but the South Shore is getting additional tracks put down that will shorten the commute in and out of Chicago. There's also a lot of bike paths going in. To me, the biggest difference in between NWI and big city life is that in a big city, for better or worse, you're anonymous. We're all different, but if I had to pick one thing that I love about my area it's the laid back small town life while still being able to walk to nature or a restaurant.",t2_9f4fi,SzilveszterMatuska,0,1639512673.0,0,t1_hojxutu,hojxutu,False,45acp_LS1_Cessna,t3_rgcces,https://www.reddit.com/r/nwi/comments/rgcces/how_are_your_winters_in_nwi/,How are your winters in NWI???,/r/nwi/comments/rgcces/how_are_your_winters_in_nwi/hojxutu/,2,r/nwi,0,2
"Yeah if you want that kind of land you´re going further east or further south.  Nothing is affordable in Lake or Porter (depending on your opinion of ""affordable"" that is).  You'll have better luck finding a plot and building, because most houses on that kind of property have been there a good long while.  Personally, 1 acre is more than enough for me.  Keeps the neighbors far away to be fairly quiet and private while not having to care for a massive plot of landscaping.  Mowing multiple acres is a horrid chore.  I work in the steel mills, live in Burns Harbor (between Chesterton and Portage), and love the spot.  Property taxes are next to nothing, any shopping I want is within 20 mins, and I'm close to every major traffic artery if I need to go further.  It's a little heavy on industrial and heavy commercial properties, but I don't go out walking around the neighborhood much anyway.

I'm overly excited about everything, I hope I find something 5+ acres.  I'd settle for even 1 acre but the closer to the 5 if not more the happier I'd be.

"I'm going on 40 and everything about my existence has been major inner city.  All of the little things I used to really like about the city I've grown to dislike.  All of the amenities of living in a city have not been of any use to me for such a long time and I really long for what rural life offers that a city cannot provide.  It has been such a long time coming but from the time I was 25 I felt like I outgrew the city, whenever I would spend some time in a rural area it would just make sense.  The older I get the more I search for what I'm really doing with my life and easier living for me is what has always been that peaceful mindset.  

You name it I've done everything in the city, good/bad or fun/horrible it's all happened and I've done it all several times over.  IMO rural places aren't boring and I don't feel like cities are fun.  A city just provides white noise and I don't want that anymore, I'm in a really good place in life right now and I'm honest to goodness jealous of everything people in a rural far off place dislike.

As far as winters, they seem to get milder and milder every year on average, with the first snow later and later (but the last frost disappearing much later also).

"Unpredictable lately, but maybe it's a fluke.

Typically - lots of snow, which I don't mind, but often you won't see the sun for weeks when it really gets going. I remember talking to someone from Colorado who was pretty floored with how little sun we got in winter typically. 

Not bitter cold for the most part, but not comfortable either.

Recently, though, it feels like it's taken a while to get going. Right now it's warmer than it usually is by quite a bit, and it's snowed far less than it usually does. I don't have records or anything, but it feels like it's been that way for several years - I can't recall a Christmas with snow in recent memory, and we've had much less snow in the past decade or so than I've been accustomed to in the past.

"Probably not the stinkiest, but the air around Precoat Metals in Portage, right outside of the riverwalk, feels absolutely toxic to breathe when the air is blowing just right (wrong). Might not be anything particularly dangerous, but it makes me want to cover my face up every time I'm near.

Outside of that, I agree with the other person responding that Whiting is probably quite bad. It can smell from saccharine sweet to outright toxic depending on where you are. Gary/Portage/Burns Harbor can smell pretty bad when the wind is blowing out of the north as well. Actually, as a Portage resident, I feel like It's been worse in the last few years. More days where I feel like I'm breathing in junk, although this seems to be more common in spring and summer than Winter (might be because I'm not out often.

I'd donate a backyard space, but we've got a ton of trees and other shrubbery and no good way to get power back there without opening up a window, unfortunately. May be able to convince some friends who also live here though.
