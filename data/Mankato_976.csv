"There was once a secret society in Mankato called the ""Knights of the Forest"" who shared a lot of disturbing similarities to the KKK. The group pushed for the removal of the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) tribe from Blue Earth County in the 1860s. When MSU constructed their Old Main building in 1869, they put some of the group's charter documents into a time capsule and sealed it into a cornerstone of the building. The time capsule was opened in 1968, but MSU kept the Knights of the Forest documents a secret until 2004.

"I have always thought the Ledbetter murder trials of the early 1900s was interesting:

""Ledbetter murder trial in the early 1900s. Journalists from all over the Blue Earth area flocked to the Mankato courthouse to report the strange happenings at the hearing of a woman accused of killing her husband. Although there was plenty of evidence to show she was at least guilty of convincing her hired man to commit the murder, the woman played to the court’s sympathy, even showing up to her trial with her arm in a sling. She was found not guilty. That very week, papers said, the scales fell off the Justice figurine that graced the top of the courthouse.“It was totally coincidence, but I think that’s just an interesting story,” Potter said. “You can just imagine this woman playing the poor victim role.” Despite the accused woman’s showmanship, she was, in fact, eventually convicted. When the Society found the story, they were enthralled by the vivid detail painted by the news reporting of that bygone day.""

You can find historical photos of the [exhumation here](https://collection.mndigital.org/catalog/blue:2418#?c=&m=&s=&cv=&xywh=-2387%2C0%2C8788%2C5165) as well.  It's hard to find some folklore and urban legends though, there is a book out there you can buy but I cant remember the name.

Rumor has it the Tandem Bagels building is haunted and it is believed to be the real location of the mass hanging of the Dakota Indians in 1862.  There was also a monument that was erected there and it was taken down in 1971 due to protests.  It was moved to a shed in Sibley Park until about 1994 until it went missing.  It was presumed to be stolen by former Mayor Stan Christ.

"Interesting. Thank you for your feedback. 
I’ll say this: I’m from this area, and even I think of Mankato as somewhat cold and unfriendly. Ive thought long and hard about the reasons why—and without over drawing conclusions, I’ll state my opinion:
Mankato is quite the industrial town, with many bars, and shopping centers. The town can be starkly divided into industrial manufacturing(downtown and north kato) commercial/service oriented further east of the river towards the river hills mall area, and then tourist (college). The city has a somewhat shallow bond to itself because these three factors are very enmeshed culturally (unique to this town in my opinion and I don’t know why) 
Also take into account the dark history Mankato has. If you do some research, you’ll find Mankato is on the map for a serious atrocity from which it hasn’t healed from. (Or it is in the process of heeling)
Spiritually the town has a shadow over it. There is a discontent I see in the eyes of so many within its city limits. 
I know the river valley and prairie area towns (think new ulm le sueur and others) bear similar culture. 
Intimacy is not something these cultures are comfortable with. Connecting is difficult—even in the churches in kato, there seems to be a wall up encountered quickly after meeting a person. People here just want to make money, buy things, and drink and party",t2_g83l9zu4,MatchMaterial348,0,1643680324.0,0,t1_hv2rccq,hv2rccq,True,afab74,t3_shgfgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mankato/comments/shgfgg/minnesota_nice/,Minnesota Nice?,/r/Mankato/comments/shgfgg/minnesota_nice/hv2rccq/,5,r/Mankato,0,5
"Mankato is the biggest small town I’ve ever lived in.

It’s got all the amenities of a decent-sized suburb but like a small town, it’s all within about a 10-15 minute drive.

Also like a suburb,  you can’t assume that you’re going to be friends with your neighbors.  College town mixed with high turnover rates of rental properties makes neighborhoods full of strangers.

also like small towns, most social activities are limited to friends and family.

So if you’re new in town, the only way to really get to know people is to meet them during an activity that you already have in common.

If you’re a board gamer, go to the Dork Den on Riverfront for Board game night. They are also the home for Warhammer and other minis in town 

If you’re into curling, go join the club.

If you’re into comics head over to Pulp Comics on Front Street.

If you’re into adult softball or baseball, there are a couple of thriving adult summer leagues in town.

If you’re religious, go find a church.

Etc 


The TLDR, I’ve been here for 12 years and still feel a bit like a stranger.   While Mankato people are rather friendly, you have to go to them.

"> Good point, but a house in Eagle Lake may still be good for someone who doesn't have/want kids.

I, unlike the troll poster, never said it wasn't a bad place to raise kids or not raise kids.  I just said it wasn't as cut and dry of a utopia compared to Mankato  --  Especially since the argument was that Mankato's schools suck so move to Eagle Lake..  Were you too biased in trying to correct me that you overlooked that or are you just incapable of comprehending the nuance in my comment?

> But that is simply not true! Where else can you smell such a sweet aroma of soy? 

Anywhere in the Midwest?  If it isn't soy it's paper.  If it isn't paper it's manure, if it isn't manure it's ethanol or some other offensive smell.  I wasn't arguing there wasn't a smell -- I was arguing it's less offensive than a lot of the odors you'll find in other towns in the Midwest.  That shouldn't have been hard to follow if you didn't have a bias against my comment.  Also, if you creep the initial trolls post history they have a bi-monthly rant specifically about CHS, which well over half of Mankato can't even smell.  You don't smell CHS up by the mall, you don't smell it on campus.  I live in West Kato, less than 10 blocks from it and I don't even smell it half the time.

> And lets not forget that most midwestern towns don't have universities. And most towns don't have such restrictive rules on renting your house. 

Almost every town over 10k people has a college in the Midwest.  Austin, Albert Lea, St. Peter (which was also on that trolls list of better places to live btw), New Ulm, Faribault all have colleges and they're all within an hour and a half of us.  That's the nature of the midwest.  You have a large hub city and a few satellite cities and then a shitload of useless small commuter towns leeching off the sustainability of the larger city.  Providing cheaper housing for folks who prefer the smell of shit to the smell of soy.


> And most places don't have bands playing loud music outdoors every weekend in the summer.

Yes they do, this isn't even an counter-argument it's just wrong.  You're wrong and you knew you were wrong when you typed it.  There is live music everywhere anyone will play.  I've been to live music at the bars in Good Thunder, Nicollet, Pemberton, St. Clair, Janesville, Waterville, Elysian, Waseca (shall I keep going?).

"I have lived in many different areas of Mankato/North Mankato. All have positive and negative aspects. 

Washington Park neighborhood is very convenient. I loved the proximity to Old Town and Downtown. My family and I loved walking to Mom and Pops and then walking the river trail. But, this falls in the area where majority of police calls occur. Houses in this area are older and have smaller yards. 

Tourtellote is going to have fewer police calls but it isn’t as convenient if you like to frequent the Old Town and Downtown areas. I love the age of the houses in this neighborhood. Many have a lot of character and aren’t cookie cutter. 

Lower North Mankato is similar to the Tourtellote park neighborhood. But Monroe is an excellent elementary school. You’re also going to be able to hear concerts from Riverfront Park and will have to deal with Fun Days traffic and shenanigans once a year. I would try to stay north of Belgrade if you’re looking in this area. 

Upper North is my favorite of all the places I’ve lived. But house prices are higher. Benco (electric provider) is super expensive, so if the home is in their coverage area, expect bills around $150+ a month. It is not super convenient for any shopping and isn’t terribly pedestrian friendly. I prefer the older areas of upper North (houses built around 1975 - 1985) because of the trees and style of home. I also love being close to Bluff Park. 

I have never lived in the hilltop Mankato area, but areas close to campus are going to predominantly student housing. The city of Mankato does not allow landlords to deny rentals to students, so it may seem like a residential area, but there’s alway the possibility of college housing. That’s not always a bad thing though. Because of the students, if you look at police records, it’s going to show a lot of activity in that area… but most calls are minor. Personally, if I were to move to the hilltop area, I would choose the Kennedy Elementary area. Nice houses, nice area, and super convenient. However, lots of sirens from the ambulance garage! 

West Mankato and Skyline are beautiful. You’re going to get the smell from CHS, but you get used to it! Walking distance to elementary school (Roosevelt) and West high school. In my opinion, this is probably the most well rounded area in Mankato.

"""stay away from the entire town of Mankato and North Mankato because it smells like soy (which it doesn't) some of the time"" isn't honest advice.

Criticisms of neighborhoods, schools or businesses in the area are valid but they literally just said 'Stay away from Mankato' -- like, the entire town.  There are 50k people and a variety of neighborhoods; yet the *entire* town needs to be avoided?  

Eagle Lake literally uses one of the Mankato school districts as their high school...  yet this person told you to avoid Mankato because the school districts suck but move to Eagle Lake..  what?

Don't validate this clown.  Healthy criticisms are great but this is just plain troll FUD.  It's just talking down for the sake of talking down.  They don't even provide real substance to their arguments.  Mankato is the only town in the nation with a bar that has outdoor live music on the weekends? 

Eagle Lake has cops and neighbors who will harass you for being an outsider, or non local.  Ever gotten a speeding ticket for going 32 in a 30?  Well, you will if you spend enough time in Eagle Lake as an outsider. 

St. Peter has it's problems too.  It's flood prone, the cops are overzealous, a US highway plows right through the center of it, it has a college with bad drivers and cyclists too.

This person gave you an 'honest' review of everything some old white guy would complain about in every midwestern town in the United States.  The people downvoting aren't biased, or taking the criticisms of their home town personally, they're just tired of hearing this old man yell at the clouds when they've obviously not realized the clouds look the same whether you're 10 miles to the north or 5 miles to the east.",t2_j4mhj,Entelion,0,1642698413.0,0,t1_hthawgo,hthawgo,False,[deleted],t3_s8iwva,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mankato/comments/s8iwva/moving_to_mankato/,Moving to Mankato,/r/Mankato/comments/s8iwva/moving_to_mankato/hthawgo/,9,r/Mankato,0,9

"> To say there is an exclusive white or black experience is racist.

A person's experience will be shaped by their ethnicity and their heritage. For example, you mentioned that you're Irish. Irish-Americans have their own experience in this country. You could call it the ""Irish-American experience"", and that experience would be exclusive to people of Irish descent. Is that racist? Or perhaps a discussion on the differences between ethnicity and culture might be useful?

> To say private school educated people need extra pay simply because of their color is racist.

Honestly, I'm on the fence regarding this. The intent is to draw more people in to make the staff of an organization better reflect the distribution of race of the individuals that organization serves. I am not sure that increased pay for certain groups is a good way to achieve. I haven't researched it yet.

> Separating people into affinity groups because of the melatonin in their skin is RACIST.

I'm not sure you understand what an affinity group is. It's not segregation. For example, nobody is suggesting that all new black teachers are assigned to a specific school (which would definitely be racist). The idea is that new black teachers could be assigned to school that already has other black teachers. This is so that a safe space can be created for identity development and empowerment. Nobody really wants to be the ""only one"". Are affinity groups a good way to solve equity issues in our schools? There doesn't seem to be a lot of research on this, so I'm not really sure anyone knows.

"I agree with what you are saying that all people should be supported regardless of their ethnicity. I did not say that all people of color are disadvantaged, or that all white people are not disadvantaged. I don't believe you are necessarily trying to mischaracterize my point. Individual experiences vary, obviously.

When you look at the aggregate, people of color have less wealth, education, opportunity, healthcare. They are treated differently by law enforcement. They receive harsher sentences in our criminal justice system. All of this is undeniable.

From 1619 to 1865 (246 years), Black people were considered property of white people and abused as slaves. Restitution was never made on the stolen labor. White slaveowners became massively wealthy. Even after abolition of slavery in 1865 until the 1964 Civil Rights act (99 years), black people were largely treated as 2nd class citizens and disadvantaged by segregation.

White settlers were able to build up massive amounts of generational wealth for a 246 year period when black people were not even allowed to own property or even get any form of education. And there wasn't a level playing field, at least on paper, until 1964.

In short, white people got a 246+ year head start economically. The overall American culture today deeply reflects the culture of our European ancestors. Everything from law, cuisiine, sports, music, etc.

To say that there is no such thing as a ""white experience"" or ""black experience"" is just something a white person says to make themselves feel comfortable. White people should carry some measure of guilt, not because all of this history is our fault today, but because we are the ones who benefit.",t2_3a56m,BestSpatula,0,1641511641.0,0,t1_hrk7rjq,hrk7rjq,False,RileyFoxtrot,t3_rrzolp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mankato/comments/rrzolp/try_to_fix_public_schools_or_build_infrastructure/,"Try to fix public schools, or build infrastructure to offer alternatives?",/r/Mankato/comments/rrzolp/try_to_fix_public_schools_or_build_infrastructure/hrk7rjq/,1,r/Mankato,0,1

I've had success with that recipe. The pie crust definitely takes more skill and time but the biscuit style crust is tasty too. 
For premades someone else mentioned Aldi, but Hyvee also carries them (go to the Hilltop hyvee on Adams).
Could also try Cheese and Pie Mongers. They have a shop just outside town and one in St Peter.

About a month after he first started at KEYC , severe weather broke out in Northern or Central Iowa and he went nuts running around the studio pleading and nagging his coworkers to do something to get him on the air.  Another story I heard that happened a long time ago when Tarello had been working for KEYC for only a few years. He used to stop at Kwik Trip in N.

"> But how do you really feel?

Honestly? Tired of suffering fools. But my pessimism aside, MN has actually handled the pandemic pretty well, although my understanding is that is largely the urban area's overwhelming the rural's poor choices. But like everywhere? now the numbers are trending negative, because anyone who is willing to get vaccinated has, so now it's a matter of waiting for the rest to get sick.

I had a casual conversation with a friend a while ago about weather trends, and we both had observed that it used to be miserable a few days every summer but generally pleasant out, and the last few years have been progressively worse, where you now spend mid-June to mid-August inside because it is so hot and humid out. (This year was a notable exception, we had severe drought so it was just hot.) It has been a couple decades since I lived in GA and I can't even imagine how insufferable it is down there now.

I am much more disgusted by our overall health system than I am with specific healthcare workers out here. Most of my and my circles encounters have been positive, finance and other priorities aside. Better than other places I've lived? Probably not?

Another thought that comes to mind, you will probably be losing some cultural diversity by moving here. It isn't that there is no diversity, but I would argue you have to make more of an effort to engage with it. For example, Mankato has an Indian restaurant and a surprisingly decent (for mid continent) sushi place. Saint Peter's most exotic is a Mexican place (we technically have 2 now!) but if you want to shop at an asian grocery, or more than bare bones mexican grocery, that's a trip to the cities.",t2_gdb03,GeckoBum,0,1636211972.0,0,t1_hjk5eyq,hjk5eyq,False,sharpestbooger,t3_qnxjj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mankato/comments/qnxjj9/set_to_visit_in_2_weeks_job_interview_got/,"Set to Visit in 2 weeks, job interview, got questions for the locals",/r/Mankato/comments/qnxjj9/set_to_visit_in_2_weeks_job_interview_got/hjk5eyq/,1,r/Mankato,0,1

Ice fishing is safe when you follow the rules. The Michigan people weren’t they were out way too late on the wrong type/thickness of ice (moving water).

The drinking can be an aspect, but I tend not to do much drinking.  It just hits differently.

"I've lived in mankato all my life.  It's ok if you're white, I hear it's not as welcoming if you're not (I try to make up for that, but I'm only one person, and I'm an introvert 🤷‍♀️)

The politics are pretty liberal (blue) in the cities (metro, Rochester,  mankato and Duluth) but pretty conservative (red) in the out state areas.  We have a Dem governor and a Rep senate (I think the House is Dem). Weed is not legal. Smoking age is 21. Interstate speed limits 65.

Social services are some of the best in the country for people with disabilities, vets and poor families.  School systems are pretty great, individual schools can suck pretty bad though. Wages aren't very good, and cost of living is closer to big city prices in medium sized towns (mankato cost of living is outrageous.   COA is the same as the minneapolis area, but wages are small town levels.) If cost of living is a huge consideration I'd stick to the towns under 10,000 population, the farther out the better.  But theres trade offs. (See politics).

Over all I do recomend MN, I've traveled but not lived other places.  The people here are generally good people, they kind of suck on the internet, but face to face they're good.

Yes, I used to live in Missouri and Michigan.  I got used to the cold in Michigan.  Florida gets so hot in the summer sometimes I wonder if that kind of cancels out the cold in Minnesota, as for several months you really can't do very much outside in Florida anyway (July/August/Sept, the mornings start at 80 already).

"Mankato Resident (off and on since 2002) here, feel free to DM other or more specific questions if you want. 

Sweater vs overcoat is subjective. How cold tolerant are you?  I would say sweater should be fine, it should still be only in the low 40s-ish at the coldest. 

The farthest south I’ve lived in Indiana and Missouri. And having been born here but moving away for things and then back, I miss the people of those other places, but I miss the land and weather of Minnesota. 

My wife is a local physician in Mankato, my opinion may be biased. Mankato Clinic is good, Mayo (who runs the local hospital) tends to refer _everything_ to specialists. But overall they’ve handled COVID well.

Fishing is good in southern MN, it’s great farther north. The challenge down here is that it’s close enough to the cities so that there are a lot of people who travel to areas around here for their lake recreation and so the lake sides tend to be pretty well developed. But just generically fishing is good. If you come on up we can introduce you to ice fishing… 😄

In my experience, Mankato does attract people for jobs in different industries. It is the 2nd largest town in southern Minnesota (2nd to Rochester) until you get closer to the Twin Cities. When you get into some of the further out towns like New Ulm, those trend more to be the people that grew up, got a job locally, and then just never left (dated a girl from New alum for a few years, that was her assessment).

Edit: looking at the weather updates, it might not be wrong to bring the overcoat as well if possible.

"Yeah, I've lived all over the country and believe I can be objective. Depending on where you lived in FL and ws hat you are used to, MN will be a big change. Yes cold weather, but a whole lot less people. I used to live in Belle Plaine and Morristown - a year each, so I appreciate Mankato where there are mjltiple shopping options and whatnot. It is a good place for a family I suppose.

I make the drive from LeSueur to Mankato everyday, its not bad. However if given the choice, perhaps living just South of the cities would be less of a culture shock.

""The mayo clinic health system is the best in the world""-Mayo Clinic
They are ok. Everything costs money of course.

There are nature trails and parks all over, so you got that. Best fishing is in the North of the state. Around here they stock, but some lake have runoff from the farms drain into the lake, so lookup water reports.

If you have kids they will benefit from the move. The school system is way better than FL.

"Hard to say about the weather. IIRC our forecast this week is mid 60's, which according to NPR is ~15 degrees warmer than it's supposed to be. IMO, bring the coat, because you would rather have it and not need it than the alternative.

I've spent time living in most regions of this country, knew what I was getting into with winter. If you haven't experienced a midwest winter, you probably are under estimating. Have you ever been so cold it physically hurts?

Having said that, Minnesota has evolved with winter in mind, so that in my experience despite having a collection of nice, warm clothing, I rarely get to bundle up in layers because 99% of my time is spent indoors where it's warm. The coldest part of most of my working days is the time I spend in the car because I'm not going to warm it up for 10 minutes to drive a 3 minute commute.

Personally, I don't think I could be more contemptuous of the American 'healthcare' system, but Mayo is apparently popular with most of the rest of the country? I personally know people who flown out here for a few weeks of the best cancer treatment money can buy, or so I was told. Generally, if you like what is available in this country, you will like what is available here. As for covid, this state is surrounded by idiots, so there's bleedover from that, but basically if you are in a more urban area it's pretty blue, rational, reasonable? and if you stray too far into the rural, it gets pretty meme worthy really quickly. Mankato is one of the larger urban areas south of the twin cities.

Fishing is big out here, though depending what you want, you may have to drive, as most of the bigger lakes, more popular destinations are north half of the state.

I won't speak for other peoples motivations, but I will say that for the 10 years I've been in the Mankato area, it has mostly been experiencing growth and expansion. The state at large has also been doing well financially, more typically having to spend surplus rather than cut services.

The immediate environment isn't bad, though somewhat limited. (Think Iowa cornfields, but a little nicer, and doesn't constantly smell like ass.) High quality environment is readily available, especially north of the cities. The wife and I like to go camping in public forests, have gone out multiple times over the past few years.

Le Sueur is probably smaller, more retarded than what you are looking for (I lived in a motel there for a month while between apartments) but if you prefer smaller town without needing a brain injury to get along with the locals (politically. Personality wise, most people out here are pleasant?), I would suggest you check out Saint Peter, which is ~15 minutes north of Mankato. Similar vibe, smaller more intimate town, I would like to think less corruption of leadership.

Potentially an issue that you didn't bring up is housing. Depending on what your financial options are, you may find it difficult to find a place to live. Both towns have colleges, Saint Peter in particular has had an official rental vacancy rate of something like <1% for the past 5 years. If you are unfamiliar, this is supposed to be impossible? is definitely an indication of imbalance in housing.

"So my reference frame is starting from generally bottom of the hill area.

Sibley is good for something super quick and casual.

Slightly less casual but more interesting, I'll ride the Minnesota River Trail up to where it loops back and turns east, then stop and turn around. For that one I'll frequently ride up to under the US-14 bridge and climb the rocks there to check out the graffiti and just chill for a bit. Doing that and/or climbing up the spot where the signs warn about trespassing on the quarry. I like to stand at the top and check out the wide view of the quarry you get there.

For a more medium-length ride, I like using Minneopa Trail, South Route Trail, and Redjacket Trail to make a loop out to Minneopa Park and back. Sometimes I'll follow that to campus area.

For longer rides, I like to take the Minnesota River Trail to Sakatah Singing Hills Trail and ride that out to Madison Lake and back. When I do that, I usually stop at the Eagle Lake Rest Area on the trail to eat something, get some water and a snack, watch the lake, feel the wind coming off it in my hair, and just chill.",t2_cg9cx,kn33,0,1636041765.0,0,t1_hjaowl8,hjaowl8,False,rollingspinach,t3_qmi3f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mankato/comments/qmi3f0/bye_october_well_see_you_next_year/,"Bye October, we'll see you next year! ✨🍂❤️",/r/Mankato/comments/qmi3f0/bye_october_well_see_you_next_year/hjaowl8/,5,r/Mankato,0,5

"I agree, All Pets has been fantastic to work with, great doctors and staff. HOWEVER…a major bummer is that they no longer have anyone on call on the weekends or after hours. They did extend the hours during the week, are open on Saturday and have a free chat line. I thought all of this made up for it until my dog had an emergency in January where she suddenly couldn’t walk. We were freaked out, the chat line told us she needed to be seen immediately. Well, no other Vet in Mankato would see her unless we were current patients, which is understandable. I believe one of the vets at Minnesota Valley talked with me and was very kind, and told me it was probably a back/disc issue (it was) and to ice and keep her from jumping and walking until she could be seen. We still freaked out as the day went on so we had no choice but to drive to Rochester or Eden Prarie to a triage vet. There we sat in the parking lot in Rochester for 4 HOURS because that place was so busy. This was a Sunday, by the way. We ended up leaving because as we waited they called and said it could be another 2-3 hours to be seen.
This alone has me thinking we need to switch to a vet that has an on call vet. Emergency’s don’t just happen during business hours and a chat line doesn’t do anything if they are just going to tell you your dog needs to be seen immediately.
When I explained this concern to a vet at All Pets when we were finally seen, I was told they u deratood but the decision was made because it wasn’t safe to have female vets there, alone at all hours of the night. 🤷🏼‍♀️
We haven’t switched yet because my dog hates the vet but is somewhat comfortable in Mapleton and I hate to put her through the anxiety of a new one when this is somewhat familiar. It’s just frustrating that there is no peace of mind if something happens between Saturday after they close until Monday morning.

"Ed Borchardt wanted a natural yard, filled with native plants and flowers that would provide a haven for birds, bees, butterflies and other wildlife. The city of North Mankato disagreed with his vision, passing a resolution declaring Borchardt's unmanicured yard a public nuisance.

On Monday, the Minnesota Court of Appeals said: Let it grow.

In its ruling, the court wrote that a city cannot declare a nuisance ""based on little more than neighbors' displeasure with the property's appearance."" The court held that the city failed to produce enough evidence that Borchardt's admittedly overgrown yard was a hazard to public health or safety.

""This is great,"" said Borchardt, who is retired from teaching botany and physics for 33 years at Minnesota State University, Mankato. ""It's been a very, very heavy burden on me, the actions of the city.""

Borchardt began planning the natural yard soon after moving into his ranch home nearly 40 years ago. The yard bursts with milkweed, goldenrod, peonies and hostas; high bush cranberries; and crabapple, pear, plum and elderberry trees.

But in recent years, serious health problems prevented him and his wife, Ann, from keeping up with yardwork, and neighbors began to complain about the explosion of vegetation.

Although Borchardt made efforts to trim it back, the City Council last year labeled the yard a public nuisance.

And despite the court ruling, the city isn't done with Borchardt and his yard, City Administrator John Harrenstein said Monday.

""The property in question still remains, in our opinion, a nuisance according to our existing code,"" Harrenstein said. The appeals court decision faulted the city for not offering enough evidence to back its contention that Borchardt's yard is a nuisance, and Harrenstein said the city will be consulting with its lawyers on how to proceed with ""the new existing nuisance"" on the property.

In February, North Mankato adopted an ordinance to encourage naturally managed lawns and embarked on an education campaign to inform citizens about how they could adopt a more nontraditional approach. The city has restored dozens of acres of prairie to their natural state and even went so far as to plant a natural lawn outside City Hall as a demonstration.

Harrenstein said he's proud of those efforts, but added that Borchardt's lawn still doesn't meet the standards of the new ordinance.

Borchardt said he's received support from people throughout the state as he's fought to keep his natural lawn. Many came during the summer to help with trimming and other maintenance.

""I didn't start out to be a crusader,"" he said. ""I wanted a place to have butterflies and not have to spray and fertilize. But it's kind of turned out to be that I am.

""I'm happy that so many people are recognizing the problem"" of overuse of chemicals and destruction of natural habitat, he said. ""We've had a drought this summer. And I haven't had to cut or water or fertilize. The plants are just taking care of themselves.""",t2_1u1hnkf2,Norinthecautious,0,1633445611.0,0,t1_hfhh9xa,hfhh9xa,True,Norinthecautious,t3_q1x4jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mankato/comments/q1x4jd/natural_lawns_are_far_better_for_pollinators_and/,"Natural lawns are far better for pollinators and for the environment, I'm glad the court found in the owner's favor",/r/Mankato/comments/q1x4jd/natural_lawns_are_far_better_for_pollinators_and/hfhh9xa/,6,r/Mankato,0,6

"I mean, not to argue with a troll, but…. if you have problems, rather than bitching about them in an unlikable manner on the internet, try to make legitimate in-roads and level with people. Be the change you want to see. If you feel like people are consistently treating you poorly, I encourage you to swallow your pride, look inward, and develop a little bit of self awareness. Instead of acting like the moral superior, see the things you can change about yourself first, rather than looking at people’s faults and assuming the worst in others. If you see nothing to change about yourself, that might be part of the problem.

Make sure to check out Minneopa falls and minneopa park. If you have a friend with a car you can drive through the Bison park and see Bison!!! Also corn nuggets at Weggys on campus . The coffee hag for coffee. Oh and Mankato has this cool sculpture walk around the downtown area. Lots of city parks too. People like to hate on this place but having grown up in Minneapolis I’ve found it pretty  magical in Mankato. And I second some really great biking. Lots of great trails. There’s a lot of great thrift shops too and a super cool used book store and some gaming stores if you are into that sort of thing. There is also a bus near campus that runs to most parts of the retail part of the city. It’s cold here in winter.

"Don't listen to this asshat. They've been nothing but a troll on this sub and has nothing but negative and derogatory. 

While we do have some of the negatives that come with being a large college town.  You're no more likely to catch something then you are in Amsterdam. Do t be stupid and you'll be fine. 

I'd highly recommend getting a bike if possible! Mankato has a ton of trails and is a very bike friendly town. Maybe make you feel more at home, but we aren't nearly as bike crazy as your homeland. If you're coming in the winter look into fat tired bikes. Very usable in the cold and snow. 

If you drink Mankato Brewery is good, but there are PLENTY of other very good options for breweries that are within a days travel for a weekend trip.

"Agreed with the “other” option point. I’m not sure what it’s there for, but the political affiliation question makes it feel like it’s going to be intentionally skewed one way or the other. Based on the possible answers, I suspect I know which way and that may impact some people’s responses or willingness to participate after reading it. 

What age are we talking about anyway, elementary, middle school, high school, college, adult? What socioeconomic class? What level of education for the subject and/or their immediate family members? There’s just so much missing from this that it can’t possibly be used in any sort of remotely accurate way, especially with a tiny sample size of only 20 responses. 

The reasons offered to select from are also not very good or complete. What if someone thinks it’s a combination of multiple factors rather than just one? Personally, I think neighborhood/school and school/peers have too much overlap to properly choose one of those if that’s what I wanted to choose. I’m also not sure if the “financial goals” option is trying to say “people do drugs if they don’t care about their financial success” or something, but that’s how the subtext reads to me. Again with the point about reading some bias built in. 

Then there’s the fact that things I would actually choose based on my own experience and that of other people I know aren’t even an option: mental health (severe depression and anxiety) and childhood trauma (emotional, physical, and sexual), stress from work and adult life, etc.

Whereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:  
""That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.  
""That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be, in good faith, represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United States.""  
Now, therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief, of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do, on this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose so to do publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred days, from the day first above mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States wherein the people thereof respectively, are this day in rebellion against the United States, the following, to wit:  
Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, (except the Parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James Ascension, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the City of New Orleans) Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth\[)\], and which excepted parts, are for the present, left precisely as if this proclamation were not issued.  
And by virtue of the power, and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be free; and that the Executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.  
And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.  
And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.  
And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God.  
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

"This is the case in some neighborhoods. They sell 200-1000 speeds not realizing your address is on a circuit that's still running DOCSIS 3.0 which they run at a maximum advertised speed of 100mbps (realistically around 115-120). They're working on upgrading all the circuits to DOCSIS 3.1 which they run at up to 940mbps. If you call and inquire they can confirm if you're on a 3.0 or 3.1 circuit (although they might not use those terms). Part of the problem is getting everyone to trade in their 3.0 modems in for 3.1 modems. All the 3.0 modems have to be off the circuit before they can turn on 3.1 for the circuit.

If you are on a 3.1 circuit and are supposed to be getting 400, plug your computer into the Ethernet port on the modem directly, and check that it's linking at 1gbps (or 2.5gbps if your computer supports it) then run speedtest again.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"Micro Center has a lottery system. Here are the instructions copy-pasted from discord server: 

How it works

• A QR code is generated daily that will be posted outside at 8:30 a.m. (Mon-Sat) and 9:30 a.m. on Sunday when there are GPUs available for sale that day. The QR code is good ONLY for that day, and changes daily.

• Scan the QR code and enter the required information to get added to the waitlist.

• The QR code will be removed at 9:00 a.m. (10:00 a.m. on Sunday) and the virtual line closed.

• At 9:15 a.m. (10:15 a.m. on Sunday), the list order gets randomized and the store will begin notifying customers to come up to claim a voucher from their available stock that day.

• The staff usually will text you to come up to the store, other days they just ask people to come out of their cars and come up. This will be your only time to claim a voucher and you have a short window of time to go get it. If they call your name and you're off getting coffee, you've lost your chance at first pick at stock.

• Once the Random selection process is complete, notifications will be sent out to the remaining people that cards are out of stock.

• You can claim your card with your voucher at store open at 10:00am (11:00am sunday) Time subject to change by the store.

• Vouchers are good for that business day only until 3:00 pm",t2_9yxj2,teh-xtron,0,1628712979.0,0,t1_h8kr1of,h8kr1of,False,Krylo2000,t3_p1y7sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mankato/comments/p1y7sj/anyone_found_any_30803080_ti_stocked_anywhere/,Anyone found any 3080/3080 ti stocked anywhere?,/r/Mankato/comments/p1y7sj/anyone_found_any_30803080_ti_stocked_anywhere/h8kr1of/,2,r/Mankato,0,2

"Actually this has more information than the Freepress.  It looks like they didn't change the core values like originally proposed and they didn't include Love, Vigilant Equity or Humility of Heart in any of their language.  Some of the language, like, ""Closing learning gaps,"" could mean that they teach less so there are fewer students towards the top.  Seeing that more people graduate could mean lowering standards so that everyone graduates.  But maybe not, I will have to do more research.  And reading at by third grade is a pretty low bar because most kids are reading at the end of Kindergarten, or at least that was the case 8 years ago when my kids were in Kindergarten.
