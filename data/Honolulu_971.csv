Decent walking and bus access doesn't exist outside of Honolulu (as defined from roughly Kalihi to Kahala). And you certainly won't find quiet unless you go way out in the country (then you get the guys with the modded exhaust trucks revving around at midnight, choose your poison).

"In general, I think it can be difficult to find engineering jobs here. A lot of engineering students who graduate from the University of Hawaii end up moving to the mainland to find work. For mechanical engineering, it really depends what you want to get into. What is your background in?

There are a lot of companies that do HVAC if you have that design background. Do you have a PE? That could help you for those types of jobs.

A lot of MEs that I know went to Pearl Harbor for the pay. Engineering salaries are lower in Hawaii compared to the mainland. But Nuclear Engineers at shipyard are on the same pay scale as Electricals, so MEs tend to go for that.

Also, are you planning on moving after your partner finishes residency? I'm not sure if companies will want to hire someone who is only planning to stay with them for 3 years then bounce.

"This pretty much. Hawaii is small and communities like the music scene are even smaller. Here, it's about who you know first, and what you know second. Connections are everything and locals already part of the scene will always be given first opportunities. Many venues and the workers and customers that visit them are regulars and treat each other like family. It can be hard to break into that without any connections or knowledge of the local scene. 


In addition, when talking about music specifically you also have to know that hawaii has its own historic and modern music culture. For public performance it may be important to be familiar with local music both present and probably more importantly past as there are many legendary local artists that anyone in the local music industry should be familiar with.

You might be able to get some work on recording sessions? There are a few studios around.

"I lived in Ko’Olina for a bit over a year and we ended up moving because traffic is insufferable. The back gate is closed and locked 24/7 so there’s only one way in and out. It literally takes 10-15 min just to get out of the neighborhood.

My spouse and I were both working on the joint base at the time. We left everyday at 545 to arrive at work just in time for the 730 start time. If there’s an accident… things are gonna be nasty.

Coming home was just as bad. We effectively had exactly enough time to eat dinner then go to bed so we could wake up in time for the next morning.

All that said, the neighborhood is lovely. The hotels and HoA keep everything looking VERY clean. Garbage is collected twice a week. Nearly everyone goes for a walk in the evenings and is extremely friendly. The community was amazing, but we were only able to appreciate it on weekends.

"I’ve got a friend that lives out there. It’s a neat area, definitely resort-ish. As others have said though, if you work in “town” (Honolulu) you’re gonna have a rough commute. Fingers crossed you’ll be working from home.

Used to be (many years ago) that if you avoided peak travel times on the freeways you’d be ok, but not anymore. Especially going out west.

Oh - one of the things you’ll want to get used to us how local folks give / take directions. Cardinal directions like North, South, East, West - yeah, they’re used, but way less than this way which I’ll now tell ‘ya about:

You have to think of your location not as “oh, I’m on the western side of x” or “you gotta go north 3 blocks, and then turn east.” Instead of that, especially on “town side” (the leeward side of the island) you’ll hear stuff referred to in reference to its relation to the mountains (Mauka), the ocean (Makai), the west side of the island (Ewa), and the east, (Diamond Head.)

Now, there’s stuff west of Ewa, and east of Diamond Head… lol, you know, in the 30+ years I’ve lived on O’ahu, I don’t think I’ve ever learned or heard anyone use other stuff in situations where they were west of Ewa or east of Diamond Head… I mean, could you say “Nanakuli Side” or “Mākaha?” 

If you don’t mind me asking, where are you moving to Hawai’i from? If you’re moving out here from the “Mainland” (Continental US), there will be a culture shock / period of adjustment. I used to live in San Diego, and after being here a while we had some California visitors. Things are just different out here. Anyway, their behaviors and general “go go go” attitude just clashes with stuff here. I asked my wife, “Was I like that?” (She’s a “hapa” or “half” gal - dad is long time local Japanese, Mom was a white gal from Ohio.) hahaha so she just laughed and answered “yes.”

Some stuff that usually takes a while to get the hang of:

-	Relationships are everything. Now read that again, and as many times as you need for it to burrow itself into your brain. ;) Who you are, where you came from, who you know - it *really* matters in the islands. A common question that local folks use to figure out people is, and please excuse me if I botch the pigeon phrase, “Where you wen grad?” - Basically, where did you graduate from high school? By asking that, they’ll know the general area you live in (and more importantly, grew up in), stuff you probably know about, and usually - key people that you may know. It’s such a simple question, but man does it have deep meaning. If you’re asked that, just be honest. Tell ‘em that you didn’t grow up here, but moved here in 2022. That leads to the next one…
-	Because there’s no way to make this the same level as point #1, I gotta make it #2…but please consider it just as important. Along with relationships, respect is VERY important. Not just respect for the land that your feet will touch, bud respect for the people, the customs, and the history. Hawai’i has a *very* complicated and (to me) sad past. It’s the story of people external to Hawai’i (haoles, which is often a term used to describe people like me - Caucasian, but also to describe people that just aren’t from here) - it’s the story of people coming in and taking advantage of the population and imposing their values on them. That’s a whole ‘nother post though. :) I am by far no expert. I will always be a haole, and even after 30 years have a hard time referring to myself as Kama`āina (a local, but someone that didn’t grow up here or is of Hawaiian descent. That’s my interpretation though, and I’m open to others correcting me if it’s wrong.) The other term you might hear is Kānaka or Kānaka Maoli. The indigenous people of Hawai'i. Oh! Along with respect for the land, traditions, etc - respect for the elders, the Kūpuna, is really important. I mean, not to say that you wouldn’t, but here in the islands, it’s important to think about what you’re doing, how you’re doing it, and how that could be interpreted by someone. Just give respect unless someone has demonstrated they don’t deserve it. That should always be the default position here.
-	Hawai’i is influenced by the people that live here. If you’re of Caucasian descent out here, you’re definitely not in the majority. The most recent American Community Survey from the US Census Bureau reported this:
-	(crap. On my phone and can’t figure out how to indent)
-	`Asian: 53.21%
Two or more races: 18.42%
White: 17.23%
Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander: 8.03%
Black or African American: 2.05%
Other race: 0.92%
Native American: 0.15% ` My intent in bringing this up is that, at least in the US, it’s a very “melting pot” kinda place!

-	Going back to the “respect” point, I think it’s important to do your best when pronouncing or writing words of Hawaiian origin. There are diacritical marks - the kahakō is a macron. The simple way to describe it is that it’s used to stress or emphasize the vowel. Think of it as an emphasis and like a “long” vowel sound. (Where that mark is placed on the same word can have really different meanings!) The other mark you’ll see is the ‘okina. This is a “glottal stop” where you stop the flow of air, and then continue. An example of that would be Kaka’ako, which is an area just Diamond Head of downtown Honolulu. (It’s a neat area - lots of food ‘n stuff!). For more on ‘Ōlelo Hawai’i (the Hawaiian Language), check out the [University of Hawai’i](https://www.hawaii.edu/site/info/diacritics.php)’s guide on that. Oh, and a note on that - I was taught that it’s ok to spell words of Hawaiian descent either with or without the diacritical remarks, but be consistent. Don’t do it for some words and then not others. (Oh jeez, now I gotta proofread this!) ;)

Ok, so this post has gotten out of control. I would like to thank my sponsors, ADHD and Hyperfocus, the superpower I can’t control!

I wrote all this because I want you to understand that you’re moving to a very, very special place. Hopefully my tips will help you get adjusted and acclimate to the culture(s) here. SO much good food and drink on O’ahu. (Not that there’s not on the neighbor islands, I just happen to live here!) Get out. Make friends. Learn stuff. Explore (carefully, and with others please.) Enjoy the ocean. (Never turn your back on the waves.) 

If you’ve got questions or want to know more, please feel free to reply and / or DM me. I am not an expert on any subject related to Hawai’i, but I do my best to learn about and respect her. I am more than happy to share my knowledge.",t2_3qtdg,Der_Latka,0,1647729390.0,0,t1_i1c3tbb,i1c3tbb,True,RunnerWTesla,t3_ti0ro9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/ti0ro9/thoughts_on_koolina/,Thoughts on Ko’Olina,/r/Honolulu/comments/ti0ro9/thoughts_on_koolina/i1c3tbb/,25,r/Honolulu,1,25

"Lived there for 8 years and Waikiki is still one of my favorite areas. Urban/tropical is crazy. It’s very walkable and easy to navigate. DO NOT leave valuables unattended on the beach.

For night life there’s lots going on in Waikiki but Chinatown is also a short Uber away. It’s gritty but fun.

Grab an Uber over to Kakaako which has both day life and night life. It’s a newly reclaimed area that has lots of funky non beach things to contest with Waikiki. Pearl Harbor is amazing if you’re into that, and the Doris Duke estate is something complete different. It requires reservations though.

Around Waikiki you can get drinks at the beach front bars, get a surf lesson at Canoes, float around at Kaimana beach with locals. 

Uber or ride share isn’t as reliable as on the mainland but is a good alternative to the bus which is also unpredictable.

"**City and County to offer an additional series of free Hawaiian language classes**

HONOLULU – In response to the high demand and a multitude of inquiries, the Mayor’s Office of Culture and the Arts is pleased to add four additional free, virtual, Hawaiian language classes open to the first 275 people to sign up. 

Although Mahina ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi has passed, the Mayor’s Office of Culture and the Arts has continued the mission of helping to preserve and perpetuate the Hawaiian language, most especially that Hawaiian is one of the state’s official languages.  These classes are hosted in partnership with E Hoʻopili Mai – a free digital language-learning resource developed by Hawaiian language Kumu, Kahanuola Solatorio.

“Our office has been inundated with requests to register for this course. Due to high demand, we are excited to offer an additional set of four classes open to the first 275 registrants. We intend to continue this important service in the City and County of Honolulu and are currently working on increasing our capacity to serve more of our community,” stated MOCA’s Executive Director, Makanani Salā.

What's more, the Mayor’s Office of Culture and the Arts will be further adding free programs in the near future, which will include music, instruments, composers, and even oli.  Salā adds, “With COVID restrictions slowly lifting, we are exploring additional prospects and resources, so that we will be able to expand to other communities and provide similar opportunities of free, online learning.  We are also looking into offering programs that will eventually be in-person as well.”

This community-type learning will be open to all ages – from ‘ōpio to kūpuna. Families are also encouraged to sign up.  This will be an opportunity to brush up on your Hawaiian language skills, or learn something new to incorporate into your everyday life.

Solatorio explains that his teaching philosophy and the mole (root) grounding “E Hoʻopili Mai” is simple, yet profound: “Aʻa i ka ʻōlelo” (Dare to speak).  Solatorio indicated, “Sometimes people can get turned off by ʻōlelo because they get judged or shamed,” he said. “I want all people to be comfortable speaking the language they should speak in Hawaiʻi, whether they are Hawaiian or not. No shame, just go! We will correct but lovingly and with good intentions, so that you learn.”

There was a time when Hawaiian language and parts of the culture were banned; however, in the late 1960's and early 1970's, a revival in cultural pride and identity led to a significant increase in the interest in and the practice of the Hawaiian culture.

Since the establishment of a [Hawaiian Studies Program](https://www.hawaiipublicschools.org/TeachingAndLearning/StudentLearning/HawaiianEducation/Pages/HSP.aspx) in 1980 and the [Hawaiian Language Immersion Program](https://www.hawaiipublicschools.org/TeachingAndLearning/StudentLearning/HawaiianEducation/Pages/Kaiapuni-program.aspx) in 1986, there has been major effort to incorporate more elements of Hawaiian knowledge – its culture, history and language - into mainstream curriculum within the Hawaiian islands.

“I feel that everyone who lives here in Hawai’i - Hawaiian or not - has a kuleana to learn the language of this land. Many people want to learn Hawaiian, but do not have the means to take language classes at the University and college levels. I tried my best to make these classes accessible to the wider public, so that people can learn from the comfort of their own homes through a virtual platform that is easy to use,” stated Solatorio.

This is correct. You'll also need liability insurance for the day naming the state as an additional insured. See below for a link. This is cheap as you're just buying it for one day but you won't be able to get a DLNR permit without it if planning on a state beach which is most beaches. If at a county beach park and not on the actual beach like someone suggested at Magic Island you won't need a state permit as the commercial activity isn't taking place on state land. https://www.insureon.com/insurance-glossary/certificate-of-liability-insurance,t2_9y1yi,jorgelukas,0,1647130962.0,0,t1_i0fmzru,i0fmzru,False,Beachtowel_,t3_tca5x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/tca5x1/elopement/,Elopement,/r/Honolulu/comments/tca5x1/elopement/i0fmzru/,2,r/Honolulu,0,2
"The Lanikai/Kailua suggestion is fantastic if you can pull it off, as it’s pretty residential.  If you decide for convenience sake to have the wedding closer to Waikiki, the southern end near San Souci beach is generally much quieter than e.g. Magic Island and most other points headed south. We were married there (on the beach for photos, ceremony inside) at what was once the New Otani hotel, and is now the Kaimana Beach. Ours was in the late afternoon and no tourists in sight.

"I eloped and had a ceremony on Lanikai Beach in 2009. It was perfection. Our wedding party was my husband's best friend from high school who was stationed there in the USMC, his wife, two daughters and our 4 year old son. 

We stayed in Waikiki the first 3 days and shopped for matching aloha outfits for the wedding party and got our marriage license in HNL. There is a waiting period, so it is important (or at least it was then) to do that before the wedding.

We then moved to a rental house in Kailua Beach.  I hired an officiant to meet us on the beach and bought leis on the way and he did the Hawaiian Wedding Poem in Hawaiian and English at our request, along with the vows and blowing a conch shell into the ocean. He provided an audio cassette of the ceremony and a souvenir certificate. I think I paid him $175 and gave him a small gift. My maid of honor videotaped it. The best man took photos. We wore bathing suits under our clothes and ran into the ocean after the ceremony and had champagne in plastic glasses on the beach (quickly). 

The children baked our cake and after some face smash, the parents in our wedding party took our son to stay on base for the next two days, which was a wonderful gift. 

I wouldn't have traded it for the world. We just took my husband's elderly mother to see the beach in January this year. Still magical.",t2_8jl9co9j,NYCandleLady,0,1647112943.0,0,t1_i0ejms3,i0ejms3,True,Beachtowel_,t3_tca5x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/tca5x1/elopement/,Elopement,/r/Honolulu/comments/tca5x1/elopement/i0ejms3/,4,r/Honolulu,0,4

There are less crowded beaches all over this island..

"Aloha, I just wanted to thank the community for all the helpful information I got. I really enjoyed using biki around Honolulu, much more fun than stressing about traffic. Even though I tried to map out the routes ahead of time I still had to feel things out and while it might have taken me a bit longer I think I ended up with some pretty simple routes for the daily ride. To get there I took Ala Wai to Kalakaua over the bridge and onto the Ala Wai promenade path and crossing the street to the Ala Moana Park parking lot road (there was a lot of construction on the path so this was easier). The return was much easier, from the parking lot path I just took Atkinson to the convention center cut-through onto Kalakaua which was easy to take into Waikiki.

1 shot of j&j and 0 tests.. masks indoors and many times outdoor as I live Waikiki where it's always crowded. Was also a late comer to the vaccine due to hesitation. Got it in September.

"3 shots, masked indoors as required, never outdoors (unless I was going from one store to another or something). Never needed to test, traveled regularly. Basically lived my life normally except no sit down at restaurants, which wasn’t a big part of my life anyway.

The way the math shakes out, shots were the right move. The majority of those that got sick/died didn’t get the shots. The masks were probably smart in places like airplanes but probably not needed at places like grocery stores. The school thing has been a disaster, they’re clearly too close. They should segregate non-vaxed kids and have them more distanced.

"Why am I not supporting Chick-fil-a? Because they, amongst others, spend an obscene amount of money on trying to overturn equality legislation.

They believe that because of a person’s sexual orientation or preferred gender, that somehow does not make them equal to someone like me, a white, heterosexual, cisgender male. Think about that for a moment. They honestly believe that two people, if you put them side to side, do not deserve equal treatment under the law.

How anyone could support that organization or any one of the similar ones…and claim to be for equality is just mind blowing.

"I don't live in Honolulu yet, but considering it. However, I do live in another place that is getting hit hard by remote workers.

I'm really opposed to it. They don't ""have their skin in the game."" They come here, inflate housing prices, food prices, etc. then promote laws and policies that exacerbate these problems (like opposing higher density rezoning, support scaling back public transport, etc.). Then when shit gets too bad, they can just dip out as easily as they came in.

And when they do intend to stay here long term, they represent a distinct demographic -- remote workers are mostly upper-middle class, as middle-middle class and lower are typically much more closely managed (viewed as a resource to be extracted to maximum benefit, rather than assets that produce value) or are jobs that, by their nature, can not be remote. That has further implications on how it shapes a community -- again, housing prices are going to be shooting upwards with resistance to affordable housing (as that will work against maximizing homeowner value, benefiting largely the upper-middle and above), etc.

It really feels like we're regressing to feudalism. The lower-middle and lower classes interests are only afforded as it pertains to the benefit of the wealthy. Where I live, even if you make median salary, it probably means you're in company-housing, sharing your room with 1-3 other people, in an apartment with 6-12 people total. The median home price is $1.2 million, and that *includes* condos and townhomes.

Overall, I think the influx of remote workers have been really toxic to local communities.

1st off, Airbnb is just fine. Don't waste your money supporting these fucktard Local 5 dumbfucks at the hotels. These dumbass hotel workers willfully forget the months they spent waking tourists up in 2018/2019 before 7am with loudspeakers from their picket lines and the continuing pointless noise making until 2am. Rooms were typically ""ready"" for guests to occupy about 7-9 hours after the guest checked in and often hadn't been cleaned or vacuumed. 
I worked in Waikiki as a waiter at the time and hundreds and hundreds of tourists told me they would never return to Hawaii based on their experiences during that debacle. 

Local restaurants are not having the easiest time right now. Even though case numbers are dropping it is tough to remain fully staffed and occasionally restaurants are having to close their doors because they can't get enough healthy people to cover all the shifts. Get a place with a kitchen and sample the Farmer's Markets. We have fresh produce year 'round, it's awesome. Plus the Kailua Farmer's Market on Thursday's is worth the drive over from town once in awhile just for the eats.

"I haven't been on much during the pandemic, but used to be a regular bus commuter.

Buses are best for short, in-town travel (e.g., Waikiki to Ala Moana or something like that). There are lots of routes so you don't have to wait long, and usually it's mostly other tourists and local workers. In some cases, taking the bus is actually faster because parking is so hard to find in many such places. 

Long-distance buses are generally not ideal. There are a few commuter express buses but they're not designed for tourists so probably not what you'd take anyway. So like, busing from Waikiki to the North Shore would take like 2.5-3 hours and multiple transfers, while it is about 1 hour by car. As one example. 

There are a few routes (mostly isolated commuter routes) that ""attract the weirdos"" but other than that, I think our buses are quite safe and clean (every time I've gotten on one recently, it smelled like cleaning supplies so I do believe they are cleaned regularly). It's a little sketchier at night, but as a single young woman I've never felt especially unsafe. 

That said, yes there are times when a car is more convenient in terms of going exactly where you want when you want. On the other hand, rental + parking is extremely expensive so choose wisely.",t2_3cxj1,keakealani,0,1644893216.0,0,t1_hwzk2r6,hwzk2r6,True,ShoujoSprinkles,t3_ssh0n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/ssh0n9/truth_about_busses_in_honoluluoahu/,Truth about busses in Honolulu/Oahu,/r/Honolulu/comments/ssh0n9/truth_about_busses_in_honoluluoahu/hwzk2r6/,2,r/Honolulu,0,2

"Absolutely echo what others have said about rush hours and standing. No joke, certain routes will be jam packed at 6:30am. Don't be one of those tourists taking up a bunch of space with your bags while people are just wanting to get to work (hello euro backpackers and Japanese families).

The bus is slow, but the coverage over the island is great. Download the app so you can keep an eye on which busses are on their way or late etc, however that's not always accurate either. I caught it every day for a few years and every now and then a bus would be late, and then just disappear off the tracking map, then show up at the stop. 

If you're getting it on the weekends, some routes will have way less busses running than during the week, so you might have to wait a while for the next one if you're heading back to town.

You will almost certainly encounter some weirdos or troublemakers, but that's no different to public transport anywhere else. 

Another option if you're in Waikiki is HUI car rentals. It's owned by Toyota and they have stations in a few different locations, you download the app, sign up and then book a car through it, walk up, unlock it (via the app) and use. I was skeptical about it at first but it was actually awesome if you needed a car for a day or even a few hours, cheaper than uber or other rentals in *some* cases.",t2_9c3e1ffg,10191AG,0,1644874127.0,0,t1_hwyi8om,hwyi8om,True,ShoujoSprinkles,t3_ssh0n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/ssh0n9/truth_about_busses_in_honoluluoahu/,Truth about busses in Honolulu/Oahu,/r/Honolulu/comments/ssh0n9/truth_about_busses_in_honoluluoahu/hwyi8om/,12,r/Honolulu,0,12

"Agree w/inquiring about a late checkout. If you prefer to stick to your original plan, it sounds like you'd need to checkout at 3p, if not sooner. You can probably get an hour or two for free if you explain your situation.

Or if you need more time, I found myself in the same predicament last year, and brought a box of liliha bakery cocoa puffs to the front desk staff around 7:30a that morning (before the rush of checkouts).  Talked story with the staff for a bit & eventually explained my situation. When I asked about their late checkout policy, they asked me what time I wanted, and I was able to extend till 3p. What should have cost me $45 instead cost me a ~$20 box of pastries. But even better, they've always remembered me since then, and I was lucky to be offered room upgrades or discounts for the next several trips.

Of course, like most outcomes in life, it depends - who you engage with at the front desk, whether they've booked the room for someone that night, or if they'd be willing to do some keyboard finger magic to give you a few extra hours.  No matter what though, in all instances, I cannot stress enough - ALOHA goes a long way!!",t2_7wfh6rlm,bts8o8,0,1644763301.0,0,t1_hws5bvb,hws5bvb,False,kai_al_sun,t3_sq26rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/sq26rs/what_to_do_between_checkout_and_flight/,What to do between checkout and flight,/r/Honolulu/comments/sq26rs/what_to_do_between_checkout_and_flight/hws5bvb/,1,r/Honolulu,0,1

"Hey listen, condos by definition can't be ""rented"" for 10 days; they're meant to be accommodation, not hotels. It's illegal to rent a condo for less than 90 days in the state of Hawaii. Go rent a hotel in Waikiki if you want to take a vacation here. At least then you'll be paying the taxes necessary to compensate the people of the state for the cost of your stay.

"I would take a Biki from one of the stations on Seaside or Lewers to the Ala Wai bike land.  Be careful for people pulling in or out of parking spots or opening car doors (the bike path is sandwiched between the right lane and street parking).  The bike lane ends a little before McCully and you’ll have to move over one lane as the right lane become right turn only.  You’ll go another block without a bike lane before you cross Kalakaua at which point you enter a residential part of Waikiki and it’s not too stressful to ride alongside car traffic (from where the bike lane ends and here can be a bit hectic depending on the traffic).  At the end of Ala Wai Blvd you will need to get off your bike and walk it to get to the bridge.  It’s illegal to bike on  the sidewalk in Waikiki and the canal is the border so after that you can ride on the sidewalk until you get to Ala Moana Beach Park.  

Tbh it kind of sucks riding on the Ala Wai so be careful.  I’ve been riding in urban areas for over a decade and commuted on the Ala Wai for years and it can be a handful for me so keep your guard up.  That said, there are some really beautiful scenes so it makes up for it! 

Are you planning on taking a Biki back too?  If so, you’ll need to come back a diff way as the Ala Wai is one way.  Feel free to ask me any questions!

Edit:  I see now that your post says to/from the park!  Coming back, I recommend you don’t bike on Ala Moana Blvd.  It’s really stressful and cars will not be accommodating.  I suggest going back to Ala Wai Blvd the way you came (the last block of Ala Wai is two way) and take the first right onto Lipe’epe’e and then turn left onto Ena Rd where it makes a T.  Then take a right onto Kalakaua.  There are sharrows on the road here for bikes and a dedicated bike lane appears a few blocks down.  Be mindful of cars turning right over the bike lane, a lot of drivers don’t check for cyclists.  This is actually a lot more fun than the ride to the park imho :).

"“We recognize how much these events impacted the lives of so many, and we are firmly committed to restoring safe drinking water in a manner that builds trust and protects the land and the waters of Hawaii,” Converse said.

Hawaii has been a strategically important outpost for the U.S. military since the early 1900s, when it set up a coal refueling station for steam-powered warships at Pearl Harbor. Today defense spending accounts for 8.5% of Hawaii’s gross domestic product.

Activist protests got the Navy to stop bombing Kahoolawe Island for target practice in 1990. This time, opposition to the military is broader because it involves water, something that everyone connects to, said Colin Moore, a University of Hawaii political science professor.

"Esther Kiaʻāina, a Honolulu city council member, said public trust in the military in Hawaii could be scarred if the Navy doesn’t close the tanks for good.

“This is a watershed moment. This is a turning point for the military’s relationship with Hawaii,” said Kiaʻāina, who was an Interior Department assistant secretary during the Obama administration.

She warned that failure to shut them down could jeopardize the military’s ability to obtain lease extensions for state lands under sites like Pohakuloa Training Area, a Big Island site used by the Army and the Marines.",t2_3a4wg,wewewawa,0,1644094755.0,0,t1_hvqn27f,hvqn27f,True,wewewawa,t3_slgbq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/slgbq9/us_military_faces_crisis_in_hawaii_after_leak/,US military faces crisis in Hawaii after leak poisons water,/r/Honolulu/comments/slgbq9/us_military_faces_crisis_in_hawaii_after_leak/hvqn27f/,4,r/Honolulu,0,4

OP, it sounds like you're looking for a entry level job with housing, that is unlikely.  Destination Resorts (part of Hyatt) used to offer it if you were doing on-call.

"Mainly depends on the size of the complex, its location and how large your repertoire is.  $60k - $75k is pretty average for a Chief Engineer at a legit property .  

You may also be able to get (and sometimes be required to take) a on-site condo/apartment, if you are doing on-call.  That carry's a average compensation value of around $25k.  If you treat that as non-taxed income (which is what it is), it's a hell of a boon if you can deal with the on-call (some folks just aren't cut out for it).

If you're coming from the mainland, make 100% certain that you do thorough research on the property and the management company that you're looking at.

So follow the rules in community areas and you shouldn’t have an issue. Just you asking shows you’ll be fine here.,t2_cr68604v,Outrageous-Owl3112,0,1643137664.0,0,t1_hu6ucly,hu6ucly,True,Peach_Salinger,t3_sc90sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/sc90sz/should_we_go/,Should we go?,/r/Honolulu/comments/sc90sz/should_we_go/hu6ucly/,7,r/Honolulu,0,7

We are putting that on our to do list since a lot of people are warning about the heat and the sun.  Really appreciate the feedback and we plan to go to any locations in the area that might be of interest. :),t2_xv704,mtnhero,0,1643134289.0,0,t1_hu6lb51,hu6lb51,False,mtnhero,t3_sc2hsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/sc2hsg/recommended_activitiesrestaurants_for_someone/,Recommended activities/restaurants for someone pregnant,/r/Honolulu/comments/sc2hsg/recommended_activitiesrestaurants_for_someone/hu6lb51/,1,r/Honolulu,0,1

"Come on out. Recommend you follow HI testing rules carefully.. not sure what the requirement is now before arrival. Otherwise you’ll be fine. Also, make any dinner reservations before you come as you wont be able to get any here.",t2_11w3h3,Mdbutnomd,0,1643129136.0,0,t1_hu67b6p,hu67b6p,True,Peach_Salinger,t3_sc90sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/sc90sz/should_we_go/,Should we go?,/r/Honolulu/comments/sc90sz/should_we_go/hu67b6p/,12,r/Honolulu,0,12
