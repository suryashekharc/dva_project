"Get used to it. This has been a light year for parties at Pershing Square. On a regular year they throw at least 10 live concerts. 

*Edit: I don't agree with it at all because the park is public and should be always left open to the public. We pay taxes to keep it going therefore we should get to always use it. I also don't agree with the decibels by homes but the Garcetti and Huizar administrations removed the city ordinances against loud PA systems by homes from their websites specifically when people started complaining about loud events the city was permitting at both Grand Park and Pershing so currently, it is what it is. Probably will take a lot of people getting organized and taking the city to task over it. I used to fantasize about parking a loud PA next to Pershing Square's management homes. Anyway... this is the way it is. Prepare for your summers and falls to always suck. We are moving after dealing with it for seven years.

"I don't think that pools have re-opened yet. There are good lap swim pools: at the downtown and Koreatown YMCAs (both indoors). Echo Park Deep is a great Olympic-sized pool run by the city - indoors. The only outdoor one I can think of in that area is the Lincoln Park Recreation Center - just east of DTLA in Lincoln Heights - run by the city. I haven't been there, but I think there is outdoor lap swimming in the city-run swim stadium pool at Exposition Park - by USC. The hours are way better for the YMCA.

"I know there were guys with guns here long before me. It wasn't until this year that I've heard gunshots outside my window. A few people have been shot, stabbed and assaulted on my block. Lots of domestic crime. There are constant altercations from drug drop offs in broad daylight. Groups of people smoking weed, coughing and partying within 10 feet of my building entrance.

"I love the people. I love how dynamic my neighbors are. 

I love the guys playing old school beats on the sidewalk. The mothers selling tamales to passersby. The people hanging out and playing craps on the sidewalk. The people who live down here and volunteer to help the feral animal population. The advocates for and the people of Skid Row. I love the young skateboarders and street bike gangs that enjoy the streets for the sake of being free and young. The neighbors who hang out in front of their buildings telling jokes and enjoying each other's time. I love the elderly people who are out gathering staples for their pantries. I love the workers who've had shops down here for decades selling everything from socks and makeup to plants and jewelry. They all have stories about what Los Angeles actually is more than what the two-year tourists want it to be. 

I love that DTLA isn't one soulless big box luxury shopping mall. Though Huizar, DLANC, and Swinerton Development ect. are definitely trying to push it that way. They won't win. DTLA is filled with real working class people living their daily lives and when things go down here, and they do all the time, those are the people you know you can rely on to get by into another day.

"Best thing is the urban setting, you don’t HAVE to drive. The location is relatively central (16 min to Santa Monica no traffic, and usually less than 16 min to Hollywood) so if you frequently visit multiple parts of the county it’s great! 

The architecture all over the place is grand, impressive and historic; whereas most of LA is pretty uninspired strip malls and suburbs that won’t stand the test of time.

The food options have also become amongst the best in town, plenty of great cheap food in the fashion district, and also expensive luxury places along 7th street and skyscraper roofs. 

You definitely find a lot of different kinds of people in downtown, particularly cos it’s slowly gentrifying. So you not only see racial diversity, but also a lot of economic diversity. People with really different backgrounds. 

Downtown is still a work in progress, homelessness is out of control (like much of the city) and there are still plenty of abandoned buildings and parking lots.

"I currently live in Park Fifth, and Trademark is like our sister building but I actually didn’t tour it at all and have only walked through the lobby once! So not much of a comparison available, but I’m happy to answer any questions about Park Fifth with total honesty. 

The deals they’re offering right now are fantastic and probably won’t last too much longer as a TON of people have moved in over the last 3-4 months. However, know that the special price you’ll get now will almost certainly inflate after your lease needs to be renewed, so keep that in mind.

I’d give my current satisfaction with the building 8/10. The units are beautiful and very well built, we’ve had no maintenance issues that couldn’t be fixed in 5 minutes by the staff on site (things like making our water hotter, adjusting a shelf for us, etc.). There is obviously some street and traffic noise from living downtown, but nothing outrageous, and nothing from within the building. 

The amenities are stunning, but access to them is extremely limited right now during Covid. The rooftop, gym, pool, and 3rd floor social spaces are open from 7 AM to 6 PM, meaning that if you work a normal schedule, you’ll probably never have time in the evening to enjoy them. They used to be open until 10 and are now closed early for sanitizing. You can only access the amenities by reservation, which means that if you’d like to go to the roof, you have to call the desk and put your name down, then have a staff member come to meet you there and let you in. Masks are 100% mandatory in all common spaces, which is great, but I’m still figuring out how to comply while swimming in the pool or eating a meal on the roof. 

The neighbors can be odd - there is a very catty group chat that loves to threaten the building management with litigation everytime there is a Covid update, amenity restriction, or when the staff shuts down their massive gatherings - those have stopped now that the new restrictions are in place. 

All in all, I’m very happy with the building and can only hope Covid winds down soon so we can get back to enjoying everything the building and downtown has to offer. Definitely ask some questions, hard to know your priorities or what you care about from your post!!",t2_734uq,bluescholar1,0,1608307761.0,0,t1_gg9g0fr,gg9g0fr,True,treyday22,t3_kfhvnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dtla/comments/kfhvnp/trademark_or_park_fifth/,Trademark or Park Fifth?,/r/dtla/comments/kfhvnp/trademark_or_park_fifth/gg9g0fr/,1,r/dtla,0,1

"In 2014 I moved out of Pegasus because after three years they had jacked my rent 12% each year. When my wife and I moved down there, everything closed as 6pm weekdays, nothing on weekends. When we left, we were screwed out after supporting development in DTLA.  They are overpriced and they constantly had to warn about residents who broke into other residents' apartments.

"I am looking as well. Does anyone know what the most QUIET DTLA apartments are meaning well insulated from street noise like with double or triple pane windows in addition to well insulated between your neighbors?   I am looking for a place where I won't hear outside noise, cars, drunk people yelling etc

From my research so far and reading Yelp reviews, searching for ""noise"" in Yelp reviews and spending hours reading

Roosevelt - Single pane windows only. Loud

Bunker Hill Apts - Loud, constant construction, renovating, homeless being housed across the street

PE Lofts - Paper thin walls? Force you to get Direct TV/Internet service (can't pick ur own)... some people said loud but another said interior unit is quiet? Possible roaches? $150 for parking

Gas Company Lofs - $225 for parking (out of the question for me, thats crazy)

Pegasus - Many said its quiet (can anyone confirm?) but $200 for parking?!

I also like the lofts that are on 2231 Western but they are in South LA (bad neighborhood!) but 2k for a loft that is like 700 sq feet and brand new. Theres no reviews tho so don't know about the noise problems if any. 

It's really hard to find a good place. I also looked at lofts in No... like the Noho Commons Lofts... beautiful stunning lofts... but you are forced to sign up for their internet/direct tv and phone through BelAir Internet (wtf never heard of them) and apparently it's slow too...fuck that.. i need fast internet.. they force you to get direct tv even if you don't own a tv or don't want cable and i think its an extra $125 to your rent or something... 

I got so desperate I am also looking at non-lofts in the valley but a lot of these places have poor insulation and fire alarms going off at all hours of the night... 

But yea, its important to read Yelp reviews for everthing.

> Lillian Disney made an initial gift of $50 million in 1987 to build a performance venue as a gift to the people of Los Angeles and a tribute to Walt Disney's devotion to the arts and to the city. Both Gehry's architecture and the acoustics of the concert hall, designed by Minoru Nagata,[3] the final completion supervised by Nagata's assistant and protege Yasuhisa Toyota,[4] have been praised, in contrast to its predecessor, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.[5]

"I've lived in a few and here are my two cents (for whatever they are worth):

* **Alina** - We live here currently and loved it pre-COVID.  The building is still great, but its a big bummer to not be able to use the a lot of the amenities (e.g., the gym has been closed since March).  The apartments are really well done with good, high end appliances and fixtures.  But for the pandemic, we'd probably renew our lease here (living in DTLA is kind of a drag when everything is closed, so we're moving somewhere we can get a back yard for our young dog).  That said, they're cutting rents like crazy (our apartment is going up for 60% of what we're currently paying) so you may be able to get a good deal if you don't care about being in DTLA right now.

* **Axis** - This place started out great but rapidly fell apart.  The property changed ownership multiple times and each management was worse than the last.  We also found out that, while the building initially presents well, they cheaped out on certain critical things (e.g., plumbing, washer/dryer, etc.) which is pretty bad.  Also, we lived in the building on 11th street, which is right next to a nightclub that was BUMPING every night (yet management refused to even lift a finger to address the issue), so that sucked.  I wouldn't live here knowing what I know now.

* **1000 Grand** - This was the first place we lived.  The apartments are fine (1000 Grand/Olympic/South Park are all sister properties so if you see one you've seen them all).  Decent appliances and fixtures but nothing to write home about.  This building is a few years old so the wear and tear was starting to show (e.g., stains on carpets, etc.) but not sure if they've been able to turn that around or not.  Management was fine and professional.  

* **8th&Hope** - We lived here for a few weeks when we first got into town.  The building itself is really nice/fancy but very ""scene"" at least when we were there.  Don't let them trick you into renting any of those ""urban one bedrooms"" that are really just big studios.  We considered living here but the rents were way too high for what we were getting.

Last year we looked at moving to Aven but the rents were wayyyy too high.  Looked like a great building though.  I've only heard bad things about Circa (e.g., that the rents were insane and that the management sucked).  

Rule of thumb for South Park, each block you go below Olympic gets a little funkier.  Living at 11th and Hill we saw some more weirdos/sketchy folks than we did at Olympic/Grand & 9th/Flower.",t2_4f8j7,DocFreeman,0,1599612008.0,0,t1_g4hzrvk,g4hzrvk,True,Peppington,t3_ip0ilo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dtla/comments/ip0ilo/anyone_lived_in_any_of_the_high_rises_in_south/,Anyone lived in any of the high rises in South Park?

"TBH I'd be weary of the SB Lofts building. I know several people who have moved in and out of there and they rarely leave happy. In the past couple years, I guess several tenants have had their apartments broken into & robbed, yet security hasn't really tightened. The elevators (I can attest) are awful and pretty much never see repair. I shit you not, MULTIPLE TIMES I've been in an elevator that has free fallen for what felt like an entire floor, or sometimes they just get stuck and you have to ring the bell until the security guard saves you. And then there's the issue of sound. The walls between apartments are super thin, which is a problem you'll run into at any SB building. The plusses, however, are the rooftop pool / view and the great little 24hr bodega outside the front entrance. I would advise you give Santee Court a look though. It's in the same price range but the lofts are nicer with better safety and amenities. I have a friend who lives there now and he loves it.

Best of luck to you! I'm sure you'll find the perfect place.",t2_60zex5ab,SqueeDabooDwee,0,1598958099.0,0,t1_g3knizd,g3knizd,True,boughtmylifeonamazon,t3_icarqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dtla/comments/icarqc/question_has_anyone_ever_rented_at_any_of_the_sb/,QUESTION: Has anyone ever rented at any of the SB lofts?

"My favorite in barbers in all of DTLA for good price, all around comfortable and down to earth, and prices is Angelo's Barbershop #7 on the outskirts of the Biltmore. I go in for the back of my head shaving. The hipster spot at 5th and Main charged me $25 for a two minute shave. I have to battle Angelo's to pay them SOMETHING. They often resist payment for such a small job. There's a great barber in the back of a pawnshop on Broadway and 6th or 7th that can do really intricate designs and fades as well. It's been a while since I've been there but they're really lowkey and good.

I don’t mind dtla in terms of the homeless, I’ve dealt with it enough. But random people coming in - homeless or not - to hide in the building is quite off putting. Do you mind telling me how much the rent was for your unit (or pm me)?

"Eh.  Lived at SB Spring for awhile, penthouse floor.  

We could afford it because management is shit.  

I wouldn’t use the laundry rooms; people had their stuff stolen all the time.  Try to get a unit that has a hookup for a dual washer/dryer combo - I think that’s all any units have room for. 

You’re one block away from skid row there.  Transients would slip in and hide in the laundry room or on random floors until they got caught.  

Plus was we never had rent raised in 3 years, and had a massive 2 floor loft with a patio.

"Can't say one is more than the other and there are enough stories in my decade down here. People shooting up right by the outdoor patio for a restaurant, I guess? Men jacking off while staring into traffic. Women stripping all their clothing off and shrieking into the abyss. Quite a few folks who look deceased on the sidewalk. Maseratis parked in front of SRO housing. Hundreds of police dressed in everything from war gear to hazmat suits pouring out of every hole in the ground to surprise flank Occupy. The turning of the Art's District into a weird and unfriendly combo of Beverly Hills and the OC. My rent going up 48% in four years. Having to rescue a tiny dog that wandered into a skirmish line between teens throwing glass at cops. People who climbed/scaled outside my window at 2AM to spray paint my window. My bus driver ran over a man at 2AM. The pale white look of shock across my building security officer's face after he watched a man bleed to death (chain vs. machete fight) in front of our doorway. My building maintenance hosing blood off our sidewalk. Everything on fire as stores and trashcans burned out all around us during the riots. A spa for actual bougie ass people who walk over human excrement and pass by drug deals in Skid Row. Police flying in and screeching to a stop all around me (came from every periphery street at the intersection) as I sat at an intersection on my bike next to a clearly harmless and unarmed black man crossing the street. Wish I wasn't late for work or I would've stayed to watch for him =( . Some turd with something to prove who gunned his mom's minivan, lost control, and jumped the curb - almost running over our beloved taco lady. So many business owners who never bothered to do their homework resulting in a constant revolving door of opening and closing businesses. A family of what I assume were Austrian tourists standing stunned/scaredregretting their destination decision at 5th and Broadway. The gutting of the Grand Central Food Market. The growing community of homeless tent neighborhoods. That mega fire at the Da Vinci apartment complex. Sylvester Stallone's nephew paying for a whole year's rent with one check and then proceeding to put a litter box of catshit in the community washing/drying machines because he was that high. I think he got evicted... My other old neighbor's youtube movie teaser of him taking a shit. (trust fund kids, man). My other other old neighbor bringing (I think) his students home.

"A few years back I was going to Exchange.  I was walking on the sidewalk toward Spring St Bar and heard someone screaming and I looked over and a homeless person had been sleeping with his legs in the middle of the exit of a parking garage and half up against the wall outside the garage.  I heard this death scream and looked over.  This van didn't see the guy and slowly driving over them.  He didn't know what was going on so he just kinda kept going, but reallllly slow and confused.  My friend and this other group start screaming and running across the street toward them into oncoming traffic and I think he kind of realized.  I told all 5 of them ""GET HIS LICENSE NUMBER, GET HIS LICENSE NUMBER, I""M GOING TO CALL 911.""  So I call 911 and I'm on the phone.  Meanwhile none of the idiots I told to get the license number did.  The BID came and talked to the driver, and he told him his side of the story and **they told him to leave**.  The cops come and the driver was gone and **not even the BID officers** took down this dudes license plate number.  They took the person to the hospital.    
  
A few days later I get a call from a detective, who told me the person lived by had a broken pelvis.  That probably saved their life that it was on such a mass of bones and not their chest or stomach.  The detective gave me tons of shit for not getting the license number.  Thanks a lot for asshole friends for that.

"Safe... hmm well, it appears less safe than it actually is. After the covid-19 shut-down, the office workers left the area. Lots of small businesses have folded, we lost a rite aid and a walgreens in the last few months. A lot of storefronts still have plywood windows. A few of my neighbors recently sold their condos, sensing an impending collapse in the market. 

Overall i personally still feel fairly safe, as the neighborhood has gone through many cycles over the years. Not like you will likely get randomly assaulted or anything, but i never leave my building without a mask and have to detour into the streets to avoid walking past the people posted up smoking pot and coughing on the sidewalk. Mostly just an annoyance. I have dogs so i wander around a lot. Some days are downright pleasant, and some days you have to see the worst in humanity.

Before covid-19 it was more diverse with endless bars and restaurants. With everything closed, look for a lot of people loitering and milling around aimlessly. 

Just ask yourself if you have street smarts. If you think you do, and have a thick skin, you'll be fine. If you expect the police to take action over a report of suspicious activity, or have an expectation of personal space... look elsewhere. Since the unrest last month, there is a lot less police.

Something good: the city has freshly paved a lot of the worst streets, and lots of projects are still moving along with construction.

"I can tell you which to avoid:

Shy Barry Lofts, SB Grand, SB Main (basically any Barry Shy building except the Bartlett)

Spring Towers Lofts

Any Geoff Palmer building (The Orsini, The Medici, etc)

The Griffin (a real shitshow even though they are brand new)

Alot of Santee places can be hit or miss (a friend lived in the Cornell for a bit she liked it)

I know alot of the buildings in South Park are new and recently built, but alot are managed by huge property companies and come with all the negatives. Many are also loose with the rules allowing AirBNB and short term rentals. Don't know them all but really do research.

Secondhand gossip about Roosevelt lofts haven't been great.

Buildings that I've heard good things about (or at least not bad things):

Savoy next to Little Tokyo

Douglas Lofts

Rowan

Bunker Hill Tower (not towers)

Pegasus (very much a party vibe but some complaints about management)

Though, one would expect a Reg4 inspection would look at interior storage of a gas like that in the shady capacity I've seen smoke shops keep it to be called into question. There's a lot that was wrong with that whole scenario. How often are buildings like that Reg4 inspected? Do they hide their fuel if the Fire Marshall pops up? Perhaps having smoke shops stacked like that in turn of the century buildings like that should be called into question. Lots to consider.

"Today the LAPD has blocked off, for several blocks in all directions, an area around where the explosion took place. The officers say the explosion occurred inside a vap shop that possessed illegal materials (e.g., one officer said ""butane""), which caused the explosive nature of the fire. They also say there is a federal investigation underway. They believe the seriousness with which the investigation is proceeding is due to the fact that 11 LAFD fire fighters have suffered serious injuries in the incident.

"In this time, maybe look for a place where you aren’t wasting money on amenities you can’t use! 

I think the positives for the Roosevelt over the newer buildings is it was built to different standards. You’re not going to hear neighbors at all. It also has cool architectural details in the lobby and units, like 15-foot concrete ceilings. The manager, valets and front desk people also are great and it’s usually a social building. A lot of the tenants hang out at The Counter on the grand floor, when that’s allowed. Another interesting aspect is there are 200 different layouts in the building, rather than the cookie cutter stacks in other complexes. There are some very unique units, and management allows you a lot of leeway to make changes to units as if they are your condo. One guy had a half bathroom turned into a closet. Some units have multiple floors and separate jetted tubs. It’s true that some don’t get good light or have much of a view, but there are units that are better in this regard. Another negative is that, because it’s an historic building, they can’t make windows facing outward double-paned. Only windows facing inward are double-paned.

"In downtown LA, there are a few museums - The Broad, Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), The Grammy Museum -  some architectural highlights - Disney Concert Hall, Union Station, the Central Library, and the rather unique Angel's Flight train up Bunker Hill.  LA Live, across the street from the convention center where E3 will be, is rather touristy but is mostly just restaurants.   Chinatown and Little Tokyo are touristy, ethnic areas though mostly just shops and restaurants.  Olvera Street, across from Union Station, is the site of the first settlement that eventually became Los Angeles.

The more interesting stuff is what you can easily reach on public transportation from downtown LA.  

You can take the Red Line subway to the touristy bits of Hollywood (Hollywood/Highland station) and to Universal Studios.  

The Gold Line light rail train can take you to Pasadena where you'll find the great Norton Simon museum (a bit of a walk from the Memorial Park station) and the even better Huntington Library and Gardens (a short Uber ride from the Allen station).  And Old Town  Pasadena is a nice area to stroll around and shop/dine.  

The Expo Line will take you all the way to the beach in Santa Monica where you'll find the pier and its carnival, and the 3rd St. Promenade outdoor shopping/dining center.  

Finally, the Blue Line can take you all the way to Long Beach, where, in combination with some short Uber rides or via the Passport shuttle buses that run in Long Beach, you can reach the Queen Mary and the Aquarium of the Pacific.  From Long Beach, a somewhat longer Uber ride will get you to the USS Iowa museum, a WW2 battleship.",t2_cn3pz,SkullLeader,0,1581187029.0,0,t1_fgyu5fk,fgyu5fk,True,bgchun,t3_f0v4hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dtla/comments/f0v4hr/any_attractions_in_dtla/,Any attractions in dtla?,/r/dtla/comments/f0v4hr/any_attractions_in_dtla/fgyu5fk/,5,r/dtla,0,5

"Faith and Flower has dollar oysters for happy hour every day from 5-6:30. (and other great stuff)

Sonoratown is the JAM for tacos. (8th in between Los Angeles and Santee St.)

Little Tokyo for sushi (Komasa is amazing, Sushi Gen (order Omakase at the sushi bar, expensive but sooo worth it), Oomasa, Revolving Sushi)

Little Tokyo Mart has great prices on produce.

Crane's Bar is a cheap, but cool, dive bar.

Get a 125 CC scooter for getting around downtown and parking and traffic are no longer problems.

Buddha Company is my favorite place for herb, pretty cheap and great quality, one on 7th St and one on Sacramento St.

DTLA Fitness has a great deal for your first month of HIIT classes.

Walk or Uber, don't drive places. Usually not worth it. Unless it's groceries, and Ralph's has great parking.

Alamo drafthouse just opened, it's dope.

The Mermaid is another great little bar.

"It’s hard for this disinterested observer to regard such art colonies as legitimate. You may be an “artist” but ultimately you are in business. You have to sell your stuff. Subsidizing such cultural opportunists — that’s what they are — does not lead to cultural enrichment. (I think it leads to the opposite.) Basically these people are miffed because they can’t live at sub-market rates anymore. The Brewery art colony (unmentioned in the article) is another example of a real-estate scam, winked at by one city administration after another. According to one post a few years ago on Reddit (or somewhere — I can’t find it now that I need it), some (or many) original Brewery lease-holders were subleasing their units to whoever they wanted to lease them to. According to that post, units at the Brewery could be occasionally found on Craigslist. From today's LA Times article:

>According the several longtime tenants, the new owners have disregarded the conditional use permit limiting tenancy to artists, renting spaces instead to non-artists and eroding the community bonds for which the colony was known.

And:

>Last year artist-residents boycotted a Fifteen Group-organized open studios event, which they saw as an attempt to use their community as a real estate selling point: Come see the kind of cool studios that eventually could be yours.  
>  
>“That felt really awful,” said Gina Han, who was part of the colony for more than two decades. “Everyone’s coming to see your space, not coming to see your art. They would say, ‘I like this wall, I like this bathroom.’”

Yep. Money talks and bullshit art-walks walk in. Bohemia is not the product of tax subsidies and rent controls. Bohemia is found under the cultural radar, not in its spotlight. If artists cannot afford it here, let them try [fucking Victorville](https://www.newsweek.com/2017/06/02/los-angeles-gentrification-california-developers-art-galleries-la-art-scene-608558.html).",t2_4y4hxpgk,BootsAndKegs,1,1572909702.0,0,t1_f6kbvmf,f6kbvmf,True,BootsAndKegs,t3_drq4s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dtla/comments/drq4s9/her_rent_went_from_1426_to_4493_overnight_its/,"Her rent went from $1,426 to $4,493 overnight.
