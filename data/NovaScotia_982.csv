Since people are struggling to understand what's going on in this somewhat unique situation I'll do my best to explain it. Truro has a lot of deer. Grandmas and dipshits keep feeding them. Virtually none of the Truro grandma/dipshit deer ever leave town. They're like a super shitty pet. The town of Truro after many many years of this bullshit going on decided to have not a hunt but a cull. That's what's happening. A select group in Truro armed with crossbows are culling an overpopulation of deer. They aren't baiting and fattening them up for some liar hillbilly dipshit. They're culling and donating the meat to people in need. That's the straight truth.,t2_klm8r1nc,destenor,0,1648266176.0,0,t1_i25jkka,i25jkka,True,Bean_Tiger,t3_tntjoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaScotia/comments/tntjoj/ns_looks_to_bring_in_regulations_to_discourage/,N.S. looks to bring in regulations to discourage feeding wildlife,/r/NovaScotia/comments/tntjoj/ns_looks_to_bring_in_regulations_to_discourage/i25jkka/,2,r/NovaScotia,0,2

"**[Condensed milk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk)** 
 
 >Condensed milk is cow's milk from which water has been removed (roughly 60% of it). It is most often found with sugar added, in the form of sweetened condensed milk (SCM), to the extent that the terms ""condensed milk"" and ""sweetened condensed milk"" are often used interchangeably today. Sweetened condensed milk is a very thick, sweet product, which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened. The product is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries.

"I lived in Antigonish during Junior High School and elementary and I was there till 2003, I can tell you that it definitely comes off as place where Sports, in this case hockey is very important maybe a little too important. It is definitely a University Town and if you were to take away the University there's not much there. They finally got a Staples and a Walmart since I moved. Everybody I knew on my mother's side some guys grow in Antigonish County what all travel to New Glasgow because it was the closest I used to buy clothes for the longest time

If you ever seen Dan Bells dead Mall series on YouTube or bright Sun films series on dead malls. You'll notice that the mall is very much a dead or dying Mall.

The School board in the area was a joke at the time, if you have a kid  that needs help in school  don't expect him to get it, with the amalgamation of all the school boards into one maybe it's gotten better I don't know. I was failing several subjects and the schools solution to trying to help me was putting me in the special ed class for an hour a day, I wanted nothing to do with that. I did not need to know how to bake a cake which I made sure I had no hand in making but did end up tasting like s*** or taking the short bus and go shopping at the store to figure out what things cost and how to add it all up and budget.

Also there's a theatre in Antigonish but it only plays two movies a night.

Also the trans-canada no longer goes the town anymore and if you're not paying attention you don't even realize you drove past it.

I went to college in truro for three years and I can honestly say it's not a bad place, truro is a small town and it is the kind of place where year round everything closes after 8 or 9, that includes all the pizza joints and most of the fast food places. Unless you want to go to a gas station right off the main highway for junk food. There is no 24-hour grocery stores and most certainly no open late anything. The one bar and grill that still exists, the engine room, Is a good place to go but even it is not as popular as it once was. If you want to go out and do anything in the evenings don't expect there to be a lot to do at night.

And last but not least the New Glasgow area where I went to high school, specifically I lived in Westville and went to high school in Alma. The school system there isn't bad there seems to be an actual teachers and School staff who care. If you're someone who likes to go out to nice Pub and socialize and have a drink but not necessarily get s***-faced then it's not really the place to do that. There are two pubs but there not as popular as some of the pubs you'll see here in the HRM.

"Halifax Style Donair in Burlington and Oakville is the actual east coast donair experience, and they will sell packages of the meat. From time to time I think they even do shipping depending on where you are. 

If you’re making it, this is the best [recipe](https://www.mastercook.com/app/recipe/WebRecipeDetails?recipeId=6969200) I’ve found (you can just make the meat part, but the dip itself is pretty amazing and I take it to every potluck I go to / party I host). 

Pro tip: really beat the hell out of meat when you mix it… you want a really fine consistency. You can roll it into a log and bake it, then shave it. I also recommend warming the slices/shavings in a pan  prior to serving to crisp the edges a bit.

"The Annapolis Valley (where Kentville) is probably one of the most beautiful places. With rolling country sides, worlds highest tides, with an easy drive to many shopping areas including roughly an hour from the city. If you're into wine, there are literally DOZENS of wineries. Local markets, fresh food. Working in Kentville allows you to live in a large area allowing for less than a 30 minute commute to many different areas. It's incredibly affordable.

For the Valley Regional Hospital located in Kentville, I used to work there. It's a pretty nice hospital with extremely kind and helpful staff. Their lab is one of the main hubs in the province and many areas source to them.

Or you can go to the DMV & take them for wayyy less! But what we don't understand is how do they train you with these vehicles?
When you go for your regular license, you can take drivers ed, use their vehicle. Then for road test, use a friend or family members. So for all these vehicles you're able to drive under a class 3, how do you practice ? It's not like eveyone has friends who drive cement trucks or other large vehicles like this.
Anyone taken it that can give any info on how it works would be greatly appreciated!

"I’m not terribly worried. I just got into the habit of checking myself regularly, and almost all of the ticks I find are dog ticks.

I get fewer ticks walking barefoot, but that could just be because I tend to walk barefoot in the woods and with footwear in the grass.

As far as I'm aware it's not strictly speaking 'corruption', at least not in a legal sense.   


I'm not Canadian but I have worked in a govt funded project involving utility billing, and from what I understand the rates for utilities in NS is fixed by the NS Utility and Review Board. NS Power complained that the thing for getting hydroelectric power from Newfoundland went over budget and they asked NSURB to raise the electricity prices for x amount of years for them to recoup the costs, to which they obliged.  


Personally, my opinion is companies which act completely independently, i.e. not government managed or a crown corporation, should not get such monetary handouts or have this sort of leverage over the utilities board. Emera is clearly a for profit company, if the project cost more than the agreed amount they need to suck it up, take a loan, or sell part of their company to NS govt in exchange for the money. NSURB is also responsible for raising gas prices, it's the same nonsense with oil companies.

"The Ottawa protesters were from many walks of life and backgrounds. They were protesting a government whose response to the pandemic and towards Canadian citizens in general is callous and autocratic. The protestors deserve respect. They conceive of the abstract concepts in our Charter of Rights as vulnerable to erosion. Canada's governments have failed to provide sufficient demonstration of need for such government measures nor that these measures are reasonable.  Cynical policy and cruel, illogical, useless interventions into daily life, lockdowns and mandates do not work and we have to make sure this can never happen again. Across Canada, these honourable protesters offer an expression of a public desire for consideration of their values that represents a divergent and essential view. If they had been better consulted and advised in the first place, perhaps we all would be spared some of the all-too-real damage this blundering government has created by losing the protestors' faith in the normal channels of public debate and dissent. .",t2_765evf7x,TemporaryThink386,0,1648000792.0,0,t1_i1qs6xc,i1qs6xc,True,Still-Opportunity-39,t3_t2otv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaScotia/comments/t2otv2/hey_ns_freedom_truckers_how_many_of_you_are_on/,Hey NS freedom truckers!

"Dear Katherine, 

I am going to drop you a few lines to tell you the news. I am having a splendid time this summer. I have been in bathing twice every day at the least lately. Who are you having for teacher in Marshville next year. Are you going to school in the village or Pictou Academy next year. They have not decided where I am going next year. Colin may go away and if he does I will stay home. 

I expect to be shifted from my place here to further down the line shortly. Did you get your returns yet. I hope I will never see mine. Did Roddie McRae pass. We are having splendid weather here only a little hot.  We are pretty near finished our hay and we expect to get of to the marsh next week. There was an old man hauling in hay the other day and he struck his head on the top of this beam (missing words) it open. 

Tell Amos to not chase Louise to much in case she should take sick again. Is Harold at your place yet.

"The how’s and why’s are something you may not get, simply because that may be something that only the at fault party knows. For example, they might have had the collision because they were looking at their phone but if they don’t say that and no witnesses saw it and say so, it’s unlikely to have come up in the investigation.

"“Scientific evidence that it could be high risk”

This could literally be applied to ANY human activity. In fact, that very statement could be used to completely ban burning, because I’m sure there’s scientific evidence that it can be high risk after 2PM as well. 

I don’t see how anyone can advocate (other than with that “could be high risk” statement) that a flat ban against burning before 2pm makes any sense, other than for bureaucratic reasons. 

So, as a  Nova Scotian, I’m to accept the fact that I can never ever have a morning campfire coffee between March and October outside of a regulated campground? That bothers me.

"I mean.....you voted for this both Provincially and Federally. 

Our system was failing before Covid. The Premiers approached Trudeau for increased funding and he told them "" I am not your banker.""

Ottawa clearly indicated that they would not discuss increases until Covid was over. 

But even before that Boomers in this province ala McNeil were already at war with Healthcare workers. And now that this decision has come home to roost....you want sympathy?

I mean we would bang pots and pans but nothing to retain staff? Nothing. We are bleeding workers and now the cost of living is so high they just don't see the point. Most of our young staff are about to jump and go to Alberta or up North. We may see some middle aged Ontarians house rich as they are jump here but for every one of them we lose 3 sub 30 staff. 

You sold out the province, made a monster of Healthcare workers and expedited the Retiree plague.

"That's not true thought. The case rate mortality in Canada  is between 1.1% and 0.6% ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2021-12-31..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=desc&pickerMetric=new_thed_per_million&Metric=Case+fatality+rate&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=~CAN)), with the variant share being almost 100% Omnicron. It may be this low for the vaccinated +booster, but I haven't seen that data.

The actual case number is likely very much higher, however we don't know what that is because we have decided to stick our collective heads in the sand and stop testing.  


So, if you are unvaccinated your mortality risk is likely in the 1% range, if you are vaccinated it may be as low as you are indicating, but you would have to source that for me to be able to make a risk judgment on that.
