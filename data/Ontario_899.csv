"This really depends on what is considered successful.
How did it disrupt training/mentoring programs?
How did it disrupt reporting/reviews of employees? 
How did it disrupt production? 
How did it disrupt accountability? 

If you're holistically looking at the organization you've got to look at how each was disrupted, was it a positive or negative disruption.  For most organizations training/mentoring programs were negatively disrupted as cross training for rolls was significantly harder digitally vs in person, and identifying people without degrees that have the skills required to accomplish work previously thought to require a degrees becomes harder. 

Generally Emgineers and Software people who are self motivated to continually be learning do well WFH,  but once they become managers with purchasing responsibility, WFH starts to reduce their ability to keep pace with marks and price points of goods.   And a hybrid model becomes more important for a company/personal benefit model

New Grads and students generally get more value from an in person work placement/new job than online equivalents. But those in person opportunities require experienced people as mentors to help with training.

Im not arguing with a lawyer, or ""those lawyers"", I'm arguing with you - a person with literally no experience in this subject who just read some shit they found on Google. 

If you were a lawyer, or were speaking to one, they would usually say ""it depends"". Because that's how the law actually works - there are many caveats like, the concept of ""reasonable expectation of privacy"". If the law was as clear cut as you make it, we wouldn't need lawyers, just dude's like you using google.

Yeah, for sure! I’m not saying that ALL “city folk” wouldn’t think to leave their dogs unattended. I have a dog that I can and will clip to a tree outside of Bridgehead Coffee. But I also have a dog that I don’t fully trust, so that’s why she’s always by me. It’s normal for people to have their dogs tethered to a tree or bike in the city. I was speaking to the fact that most people don’t understand how a dog can be so far out of their sight that a whole litter with mother are able to get taken without a peep. I would question it if someone pulled up and started hauling dogs into their car outside of a coffee shop.

"They can make a case for either needing the space for family or wanting full range of their house, and the tenant needs to be gone within 60 days(N12). 

If the owner is in dire need of finances to move, I can see them paying a fee to make their headache go away. 

This tenant is obviously looking for more than an acceptable amount for payout. Likely more than what they would pay in rent for a year. 

If I were in this situation as a landlord, I would move into the apartment after they are evicted (60 days) and rent out the unit I previously occupied under a short term rental agreement for one year. After that, it is kosher to sell. The Ontario housing market isn’t going to fall in the next year. People have predicted a fall every year for the past 20 years, and it hasn’t. They could make another 50-100k by holding out one year. 

As for thinking I have no clue, I came from nothing and own 3 duplexes so I do have a little bit of experience in this area. Apparently not as much of an expert as you are though. 

If I were going to sell one of my houses, I would do exactly as I said above. A tenant has no business profiting from someone else’s hard work.

"I've offered an actual source for what I've claimed.  Rambling doesn't replace the fact that you haven't done so.

The statement that was made in the part I quoted has not been disputed.  Later in the article Lecce's statement makes clear the province was asking for a better deal than the other provinces.

There's no source stating they received that.  Only that they would finally be signing.  Every province has been offered the same deal.  Ontario has finally accepted.

The truth is, the people of Ontario needed their government to secure this offer a long time ago for the very reasons they say they didn't sign it.  Our families needed the money they weren't getting by that delay.

That money was ***not just federal***, it required provincial spending too.  But time has gone by, and that means ***LESS provincial spending***.  It's pretty straightforward.  This delay saved the province money it spent on other things at the expense of working families.  This government ""says yes"" to working families picking up the burden, but ""says no"" to increasing the amount the wealthiest Ontarians and corporations pay for a system they benefit the most from.

You believe that we've achieved a better deal.  Great.  So I assume you're going to hold them to that.  Right?  You're going to find out when the information is unequivocally available if that happened, and if it didn't save Ontario families what they've lost by being the last province or territory in Canada to take the same offer making those kind of savings possible you're going to hold this government accountable for that, right?

But regardless, you have absolutely no verifiable reason to believe that.  Every other province and territory, who went through the same process took the same deal.  You believe Ontario to be special, that all the time must have paid off.  I get it, it's your team.  But be honest about the basis for that belief.

It's interesting.  I have three separate lines of people defending this.  One says it's not the OPC government's fault, it's Trudeau.  The other says it's nobody's fault...they believe Ontario families will get all their money back.  Now your take is that this is a great thing, that you believe we've got a great deal that's going to make all this waiting while paying through the nose worth it.  Meanwhile, there's nothing to show they've done anything but sign the same deal every other province and territory did.

Meanwhile, ***plenty*** of people have been complaining about Liberal underspending.  They currently have seven seats in the legislature and are running a party insider from their last unapologetic government.  The Ontario Liberal Party is also responsible for the state of so many of our critical public systems.  **If you can recognize that as wrong, perhaps you can be honest enough to acknowledge even greater levels of underfunding during a crisis is even worse.**  Now, I know, currently you believe this government has actually injected loads of spending into every sector of government while somehow also not spending money we don't have like the Liberal government.  It's a neat magical dual state of mind, but we'll deal with that later.

Nobody blames Ford for not printing more money.  People blame Ford for spending money recklessly on the wrong things, abandoning revenue streams and assets, and failing to generate new sources of revenue to invest properly in the people of Ontario.  We can't afford NOT to do this.  We haven't saved money by running these systems as we have.  We're forced to spend more money than would be otherwise required.  It's inefficient.

When you fail to perform basic maintenance on a car you depend upon for your livelihood, you aren't saving money in anything other than the immediate term.  You're ensuring future costs are going to be much higher and risking sources of revenue.  Ontario is a lot like that, only with problems that grow far more expensive and cause enormous reductions in future revenue.

Shooting for a single year before an election to have a low deficit or to break even or have a small surplus is utterly irresponsible finance.  It keeps happening, and it keeps leading to the same predictable outcomes.  When are people that claim to care about the fiscal health of this province going to take more than a grade school approach to understanding a generational scale issue like provincial debt?  I mean that's the level of discourse from a major political party on the subject so I get where it comes from...but come on.  They don't even believe the garbage they are selling.  We need honesty, transparency, and long-term thinking to reduce the provincial debt.  Failure to do that results in what we've been witnessing for decades.

"Everything that the political side of politics (no matter the party or if it is majority/minority govt) wants to do needs to go through bureaucrats. They, in the form of Treasury Board and the Ministry of Finance, will tell govt if something is doable - in terms of policy, a program, anything. So when Ontario creates a mandate, (which is what they go to the bargaining table with to negotiate something like a child-care deal) that mandate needs to be approved as recommended by public servants that serve without bias. Those bureaucrats then negotiate with the same, non-bias public service, at the federal level. Sure, there is most likely communication from the political side from both the feds and the province as talks break down - but overall, the mandates are drafted and approved by public servants who give political staff THEIR recommendations on what the province needs. 
So yes, stating that Ontario purposely waited until the last minute to announce this is insane. The federal government historically shafts Ontario with Canada-wide programs - always stating we should be able to support ourselves.
One easy example is to look at the federal money we get for labs and disease tracking for our science testing labs in Ontario. It is the lowest amount in comparison to every single other province. Quebec recently had to go back to the negotiating table on that to obtain more federal funding, and rightfully so - if you consider population and the complexity with a location like Ontario versus other provinces. Ontario is probably doing the same as we speak to negotiate a better deal. The same as other Ministries actually. Ministry of Infrastructure recently made a committment of tons of money for future infrastructure planning over the next 10 years (the most amount ever), and are calling on the feds to match. But who knows if they will budge and help Ontario. But does it matter? Im sure Ontarians will just blame Ford for not printing more money somehow to cover all these costs, despite him already using a budget larger than any other government. When the Liberals were in, no one complained about under-spending, now Ford is in, spending the most ever in all sectors (even in Indigenous programs, despite no Indigenous person ever voting for him), and everyone claims cuts everywhere.",t2_evpth,Coutoz,1,1648269189.0,0,t1_i25opyg,i25opyg,False,MethoxyEthane,t3_to9bmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/to9bmp/robert_benzie_prime_minister_justin_trudeau_and/,[Robert Benzie] Prime Minister ⁦Justin Trudeau and Premier Doug⁩ Ford to make it official on Monday: Ontario is finally signing a $10-a-day child care deal.,/r/ontario/comments/to9bmp/robert_benzie_prime_minister_justin_trudeau_and/i25opyg/,0,r/ontario,0,0

"OP, a sensible number is going to depend on your lifestyle and what you can afford. For example, I spend over $700 a month for my car. I realize that this is not necessarily an expense that everyone can afford. I could have purchased a vehicle that was much cheaper but I had personal reasons for wanting this specific vehicle.

When I make decisions regarding whether I can afford something I take a look at my income sources, expenses and desired savings. I take a look at how much money I have left over and that’s usually my judgment for any new expense. If I can’t afford it, I start considering my options.

I save quite a lot, over 30% of my income is invested annually in My RRSP/TFSA and High Interest Savings account. So realistically I could cut back on my savings to afford a new expense. I know I will eventually have to cut back or invest outside of a TFSA/RRSP because I am nearing my limit (playing catch up on my accumulated contribution room). So cutting back on savings isn’t the worst option. That being said, I am a big fan of compound interest when it works in my favour so cutting back on my saving is usually the last option I’ll consider.

Next is my expenses, is there anything I can do to cut expenses? Recently, I found that I can save a decent amount buying frozen Basa Filet instead of opting for the more fresh Atlantic Haddock that I normally would use for cooking. The quality is noticeably different but I can still make some delicious meals with it. The savings aren’t significant, but I have cut my average grocery bill from $175 a month to $150 a month simply by making small adjustment to my meal plans. The expenses that I can usually find some form of savings for are services like phone/internet/tv.

Finally, is there any way for me to attain more income. Maybe I could ask my boss for a raise? It’s not something I’ve ever done, though I have expressed interest in taking on more responsibility throughout my career and I believe this lead to some opportunities that I may have been looked over had I not expressed interest in possible opportunities. I’ve also considered taking on an additional part-time job for a brief period of time. Data entry was something I had once looked into doing as it was something I was really good at but unfortunately couldn’t find anything that lined up with my schedule.


TLDR; only you can decide what’s reasonable for you. There’s no magic number that works for everyone. People have different priorities in life which will allow them to spend more on certain luxuries than what you can afford based off of what’s important in your life. Take the time to make a plan for your finances and what’s reasonable will become much clearer to you if you do.",t2_cwfkt6kh,MisterTriangleMan,0,1648267023.0,0,t1_i25l2j4,i25l2j4,True,tvamshikrishna117,t3_tnbiiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/tnbiiq/car_expense/,Car expense,/r/ontario/comments/tnbiiq/car_expense/i25l2j4/,1,r/ontario,0,1

"So what you are saying is, your correction is based on your speculation that the Ford government will take inspiration and run on a Del Duca promise to spend new money if elected to cleaning up after the same mess I just got done saying was the reason for the delay in the first place.

Neat.

When you shit the bed and make voters clean up after it, and then your opponent offers to pay them back for your doing so, it isn't taking credit for anything to say you'll do the same.  It's highlighting that you shit the bed in the first place and are refusing to do anything about it unless voted back in, and even then only because your opponents made the offer first.

I mean, it's possible but even if they did...that wouldn't be ""the point"".  It doesn't make the delay reasonable or an after election promise to clean it up honest.

It's AT BEST if they followed the opposition's lead stealing from Ontario families to cover other budget goals and promising to maybe pay them back later if they fill in the right paperwork on time and have the valid authentication without interest and possibly not in full and if they would be kind enough to sign up for more of the same shit treatment by voting for them first in the next election.",t2_6pjqc0,MountNevermind,0,1648266551.0,0,t1_i25k8pt,i25k8pt,False,MethoxyEthane,t3_to9bmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/to9bmp/robert_benzie_prime_minister_justin_trudeau_and/,[Robert Benzie] Prime Minister ⁦Justin Trudeau and Premier Doug⁩ Ford to make it official on Monday: Ontario is finally signing a $10-a-day child care deal.,/r/ontario/comments/to9bmp/robert_benzie_prime_minister_justin_trudeau_and/i25k8pt/,0,r/ontario,0,0

"Yes exactly.

When you have actual information about the Ford government paying families back for its own delay (*this would cost way MORE than accepting the offer in the first place as the cost to families would have been paid by federal and provincial funding under an accepted deal, paying them back afterward from provincial funds is either still shafting families or costing the province extra money)* in getting the same deal offered to every province and territory from the outset, let us know.  That will still be worthy of criticism, because even if it happened it would in no way amounts to a give away, and we all know plenty of families wouldn't see a dime.  Figuring out who was owed what and giving it to them would simply add to the associated costs.  All of that to give people what citizens of better run provinces already had.

"I have Turkey, chicken, and ground hamburger Canned atm. I have pork in the freezer but not enough to Can up yet. 

You cannot Can everything at home, as our tools are just not the same as the the ones in commercial factories. We use home pressure canners like Presto, and All American to safely Can scientifically tested low acid foods. 


You can even Can some fish like salmon and I think trout, and some seafood bugs lol Even rabbit, deer, moose, sheep, and bear. Depending on cut, you can Can poultry with the bones, like thighs and drums. I prefer chopped up poultry, as it's less work come time to use it. 


We cannot Can dairy, eggs, and flour due to density issues, so it doesn't get hot enough to kill all nasties. 


Canned goods last basically forever (not really, but it's an crazy long time). There is 1 neato recipe that is super short lived, as it has has ingredients you're not suppose Can. Its lemon curd, and it lasts for 3-4 months before it starts breaking down and going rancid. 


More neato things, is that not all bugs are killed during Canning. The bug that makes Flat Sour cab survive the high heat temps, but its not harmful, and only ruins the taste if you don't follow proper cooling of processed jars. Eg: water bath Can tomato sauce for the proper amount of time, turn the stove off, then you fall asleep forgetting to take them out after your timer goes off for the cool down period. Hours go by and the tomatoes sit in the ""danger zone"" for too long. That's when that bug wakes up and starts shitting in the tomatoes..little fucker. You open the jar months later to eat it, pour it on your food, take a bite and YUCK!!! 


If you're interested I can get you a url to a strict safe Canning group (FB). They are big on educating n00bs and you learn so much by just reading posts.

"I think your blame/hate is misplaced. 

It’s not generations but classes that are the issue. 

The 65 year old woman who works at Tim Hortons or the 68 year old man working at Walmart are hardly making the world worse for everyone.

">Uh huh, we've all seen that one national post poll. But if you look at the polls during the Omicron wave, Ford got hammered

I read that link.  It says that Ford's polling was bad (and it's improved significantly since then I might add).  It says nothing about mandates.  In fact, his polling was bad because he reintroduced unpopular mandates like closing indoor dining and gyms.  

>And another poll in January showed that a majority of people supported restrictions due to Omicron going fucking ballistic.

The National Post Poll is more recent.   Read the specific data regarding Ontario:

""Respondents living in Quebec (71 per cent), Alberta (65 per cent) and **Ontario (65 per cent)** were found to be the most likely to hold this view

65% of Ontarians are for the removal of Covid-19 mandates.  

>What do you think they're going to say when BA.2 does the same thing next month?

BA.2 has been shown to be just as mild as the original Omicron.  Other developed countries have been experiencing rising cases, yet hospitalizations have remained stable and none have reimposed social gathering restrictions.

>Moore recommended removing the mandates because he's been heavily pressured by Ford, just as his predecessor Williams was

Not true and not true.  Dr. Moore and Dr. Williams were both appointed by an independent body which has nothing to do with Doug Ford nor anyone in his government.  Dr. Moore has no skin in the game politically and would still keep his job no matter what party is in control. 

For the 2nd time, BC has removed Covid-19 mandates as well.    BC has an NDP Premier and Vancouver has an NDP mayor.  Removing Covid-19 mandates because they are no longer useful nor effective is not some reckless Conservative policy - it's universal scientific consensus, I know it's hard to read that.  

>Other scientists who aren't subject to that pressure said that removing masks was ludicrous

Plenty of scientists, doctors and other public health officials have supported mask mandates in Ontario.  

>it's the same as when government scientists were being pressured by Harper to say that climate change isn't an issue.

Another Neo Liberal/Socialist bringing on this sub bringing up Stephen Harper, sigh.   Stephen Harper was last Prime Minister in 2015, more than 7 years ago, time to move on.  

>That's one example of a ""sensible NPI"", unless you're one of those people who has a meltdown at the idea of wearing a mask.

I'm not one of those people who has a meltdown at the idea of wearing a mask.  I am one of those people who follows the recommendations of the Chief Medical Health Officer and his colleagues.  As of now, they have recommended that mandatory masking is no longer required in most public settings and individuals can make their own judgement.  I am following the science.  

>And, yeah, a lot of them are alt-right. Ekos found an enormous correlation between being a ""mandate skeptic"" and supporting Putin's fascist war.  
Why on earth would there be any kind of connection between those unrelated things? Well, because the loonies who are actually propelling the ""skepticism"" all mysteriously pivoted to cheering on Putin. And, yeah, it's being propelled by anti-Semitic conspiracist lunacy, not healthy skepticism.

"No one wants indefinite but you can’t just ignore it either. We have 90% vaccinated. We should not be putting everything at risk so the 10% can have their cake and eat it too.

Tough problems need tough solutions. Is it humane to tell a cancer patient or any one of many other surgeries that are not currently “critical” in doctor terms but will significantly lessen there quality of life and maybe end up with them being critical when they didn’t have to be, that they are going to have to wait because someone made a bad choice but now they are really sick and get to go to the front of the line?

Covid is not gone just because we want it to be. UK Covid infections have climbed by a million in a week. A million.

There is not enough money to create enough hospital capacity for the need driven by the unvaccinated during the pandemic. Even with the tent hospitals they still had to cancel all “electives”, implement the health measures and we have driven our healthcare workers to the brink.

There will be more waves. What is the solution? We managed before by cancelling electives and imposing masks, mandates and capacity limits or lockdowns. If we don’t want any of those measures what are we to do? Let people die in the streets and at home. Images of Spanish Flu body collectors calling “Bring out your dead!”

It would not be a ban per se. A choice. Package deal “A” or “B”. 

Choose “A” Do your part to reduce the cost to society and the risk of requiring hospitalization (and therefor the risk that our healthcare system will be overwhelmed) by being vaccinated and you get priority for a bed if you happen to get sick. 

OR Choose “B” - choose not to be vaccinated and if you get sick you don’t get priority hospitalization. Other procedures are not cancelled to reserve capacity for your dumb ass. You are only entitled to the outpatient anti-viral. If a bed happens to be available you may get one but you may be bumped and sent home if the bed is needed.

If we don’t want lockdowns, masks and mandates then we have to have a solution to why the hospitals were overwhelmed. Unvaccinated we 10x more likely to be hospitalized.

We keep on going around in circles so for the last time:

1) the Bloc and Greens are SINGLE issue parties.  They would vote with the Conservatives or Liberals if the legislation helped further their issue (Quebec Individualism, Environmental issues).   They vote on legislation solely on how it impacts their issue. 

2) The Liberals received the lowest percentage of votes in any incumbent party in history.  The Conservatives received more votes than the Liberals.  Only 50.4% voted for Neo Liberal/NDP - hardly broad support for a big government, socialist agenda.

"Uh huh, we've all seen that one national post poll. But if you look at the polls during the Omicron wave, [Ford got hammered](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-doug-ford-government-polling-covid-1.6380169). And [another poll in January](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/slim-majority-support-government-lockdowns-restrictions-in-response-to-omicron-poll-1.5735159) showed that a majority of people supported restrictions due to Omicron going fucking ballistic.

What do you think they're going to say when BA.2 does the same thing next month?

Moore recommended removing the mandates because he's been heavily pressured by Ford, just as his predecessor Williams was. It's the same as when government scientists were being pressured by Harper to say that climate change isn't an issue.  Other scientists who aren't subject to that pressure said that removing masks was ludicrous, and even the Science Table was wary of it. That's one example of a ""sensible NPI"", unless you're one of those people who has a meltdown at the idea of wearing a mask. 

*(Other sensible NPIs would be, for example, proper air filtration and ventilation. COVID doesn't usually spread outside because it dissipates into the air. It spreads inside because the virus fills the room due to poor ventilation and then everybody breathes it in. It's the same fucking thing as second-hand smoke, or do you think those laws are bullshit too?)*

And, yeah, most of the anti-mandate agitators are alt-right. Ekos found an [enormous correlation](https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2022/03/19/how-vaccination-status-might-predict-views-on-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine.html) between being a ""mandate skeptic"" and supporting Putin's fascist war. Why on earth would there be any kind of connection between those unrelated things? Well, because the loonies who are actually propelling the ""skepticism"" [all mysteriously pivoted to cheering on Putin](https://www.politico.eu/article/antivax-conspiracy-lean-pro-kremlin-propaganda-ukraine/). And, yeah, [it's being propelled by anti-Semitic conspiracist lunacy](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/03/pro-putin-disinformation-on-ukraine-is-thriving-in-online-anti-vax-groups/), not healthy skepticism. Sorry, dude, but you're neck deep in a movement filled with absolute psychotics.

Edit: Also, buddy, you're ***clearly*** someone who's motivated by your right-wing politics here. Don't pretend you're a concerned progressive, or that you have the faintest clue how progressives see this situation.

You can see how they feel from that poll in January: 

>Sixty-four per cent of respondents said they supported vaccine passports for malls and other retail outlets, including liquor and cannabis shops but excluding grocery stores. The poll showed 61 per cent of respondents wanted vaccine requirements for public transit users.

Around 30% of the Canadian public are hard-core right-wingers, the kind who always vote Conservative and loathe Trudeau. Considering this issue is incredibly politically polarized, they're going to be substantially pro-COVID no matter what.

">""Lockdowns"" are opposed if you define them so broadly that it's meaningless, that doesn't mean that most people foam at the mouth against sensible NPIs

The majority of Canadians want Covid-19 measures removed:

[https://nationalpost.com/news/two-thirds-of-canadians-ready-to-drop-covid-19-restrictions](https://nationalpost.com/news/two-thirds-of-canadians-ready-to-drop-covid-19-restrictions) 

Ok, what's a ""sensible NPIs"" then?  Capacity limits?  Limited hours at restaurants?  Those certainly aren't ""sensible"" to people working in the restaurant and hospitality industries.  

>And no it's not ""people on all sides"" in general, the core of antimaskers and antivaxxers who are also against NPIs are either delusional white boomer dudes or literal alt-right fascists (or, yeah, both)

You didn't read what I wrote, I said people on both sides are for the removal of Covid measures, not anti vaxxers.  You may not believe this but there are people who are for dropping all covid mandated who are also *not* anti vaxxers.  I know shocking right?  There are some people who just trust and follow the science, and Dr. Moore has recommended removing the mandates.   Just in case you think this is somehow reckless Conservative policy, they have also been removed in BC, where an NDP government is in power.  

> antivaxxers who are also against NPIs are either delusional white boomer dudes or literal alt-right fascists (or, yeah, both)

Again, this is another false stereotype perpetrated.  Anti vaxxers come from many different backgrounds and political leanings.  In fact, Macleans Magazine found that the typical vaccine hesitant person was a 42 year old woman with Liberal leanings:

"It sucks, but that's how it works. The labour market assumes that you will know what you want to do for the rest of your life, and gives you about 5-8 years grace period to gain the skills you need to earn a living. If you change your mind about your choices, you're on your own to figure it out.

If you're thinking about a career change, look into government programs that provide funding for retraining/education. I don't know much about apprenticeship, but I'm pretty sure you get paid for that (albeit less than a certified professional). Alternatively, you can start saving money to carry yourself over through the apprenticeship period.

Lastly, because it's an election year - pay close attention  to the candidates in your riding and make sure to vote for the party that is willing to invest in better labour market programs that can benefit you.

"""Encouraging"" means shit. We learned that way back in 2020 with masks. People take their cues from what's mandated, because that's the signal that something is important. 

Like, cops are notorious for not enforcing masking rules, yet mandates do still do a good job of getting people to mask up. Most people just comply with the mandates because of the signal of importance, and then a whole bunch of other people comply out of peer pressure. You'll still have the outliers, but they do far less damage. 

(The same is true for most laws.  Unless you're a weird sociopath, you don't drive drunk just because you think you'll get caught, but because there's a norm saying ""don't drive drunk, you'll fucking kill someone and it's socially unacceptable"".)

The problem is that the outliers are insanely politically motivated.
