"I applied to Lulu a few years ago. The interviews were crazy, 4 of them for a non manager position. Those who worked there were… *very* grateful they worked there. The company culture is HUGE, it’s been described as almost cult like. They ended up hiring someone with less technical experience than me for the role… but the person was known to the store through their employees and yoga classes. In the group interview they literally stated they had no experience with this kind of role. If you’re not active don’t bother applying. They ask you straight up what physical activities you do, and the group interview was dumb questions like “what’s the scariest thing you’ve done in your life.”

"I think CBC needs to look more critically at the landlord lobby groups. FRPO, Ontario Landlords Watch and SOLO. They have the LTB's ear and are at the table for decision making. 

[SOLO](https://soloontario.ca/), a relatively new group is pretty shady. They've raised tens of thousands through GoFundMe claiming they are filing a class-action against the LTB. Now they claim that they are refunneling the money for PR. Most of their leaders are anonymous and they've tried to [blame this landord's suicide](https://soloontario.ca/tragic-news-for-a-solo-landlord/) on the LTB. 

I find the CBC too often takes a ""both sides"" approach to housing issues and gives lots of profile to landlords without acknowledging the inherit power imbalance. A landlord being short a few month's rent is not equal to a tenant losing their home. The landlord is operating a business and should be familiar with the rules of their business – I rarely see this framing from the CBC.

The recent Fifth Estate episode was good.

"Lot's of polarizing stuff being thrown about with this topic.

Feminism?

Yes it's mostly men, and few women, but... isn't generalizing stuff like this exactly what we're trying to stop with fighting sexism, racism, anti-LGBTQ2+, religious discrimination, and all the other bigotry?

Responding to the above incident with ""Men!"" is not a feminist take on the phenomenon of needle-spiking and date-rape. What value is added to this debate, by extrapolating it into gendered libel, and then attacking anyone who points out that issue? The actual issue gets lost in a bunch of misdirected anger and frankly gross accusations that people arguing for keeping the conversation on point are **all** rapists.

Yes, it has been reported frequently in the UK, and perhaps unsurprisingly, reported cases skyrocketed after initial cases were reported. The article does not mention that there has yet to be a single confirmed case.

>and it’s becoming more common in North America.

>The third-year Queen’s student said that she never lost consciousness and that she thinks the injection didn’t work properly.

"Yeah,  pretty much.  Just like a previous post mentioned,  the affordable housing program where they loan you a downpayment is a joke, since there are very few homes that actually sell within their price metric.  It seems to be written by people who are entirely out to lunch.

Affordable housing waitlists are so long they're borderline pointless.  Seriously,  you'd be lucky if you got into a unit by 2030.

As for market housing,  it's absolutely insane what people are expected to pay given what people make.  

And then there is the scummy developer side; from jacking up new build prices because the market went up to building irresponsibly wasteful subdivisions with no regard for anything but profit. 

They're looking at building a new suburb in the hamlet I grew up in.  It'll ruin the area,  cost a shitload to maintain and be financially insolvent,  and it's wqy the fuck away from any urban area.  I don't know how anyone who approved that mess can live with themselves, but it's still happening. 

They tried to whitewash it by claiming they're committed to affordability and young families.  Which perfectly explains why they're building 700k mansion far away from any major employment.

"No it was legal long before that unfortunately.  Once a unit is vacant, the landlord can rent it for whatever they can get on the market, absolutely no restrictions, nor dependent on the year it was built.   The only rent control we have had for a long time in Ontario is in place once you have signed a lease...the yearly rent increases are then controlled and any larger increases require a special application process to be undertaken by the landlord.

This has created a very large problem that I don't see covered much...people in lower incomes cannot move.  As soon as you leave your current lease, you are renting at market rate.  Often 500-1000 dollars more a month.  So people stay.  Apartments are commodities, people in the same building renting the same units can be paying hundreds to a thousand or more difference a month.

This is also why renovictions are so harmful.  If people lose their rent controlled units they often have to move away from their communities to rent or they enter the homeless cycle.  Many are seniors and disabled on fixed income.  It is tragic.

My understanding of what Ford did, which is really damaging, is he removed the rent control on leases...even if you continue your lease beyond the one tear term, there are no controls in new buildings.

It's the difference between paying rent vs building equity. If you have 2 kids that will go to Queen's, it makes sense. Pay a mortgage for 8 years, sell at the end. If your kid does grad school, in 5 yrs, the buyer can expect appreciation and if it's in the child's name, no capital gains taxes. The kid'll  have a downpayment or nest egg to get them started, from the profits, or even be able to make a dent in student loans. If prices fall, the location means it'll rent easily. No car required, no issues with rentals, roommate issues, and it looks like it'd be a secure building. Even moving a student every year costs $$. It all adds up.

"Correlation is not causation. Netflix has become the most popular streaming platform during the same time period. Did it cause housing prices to increase? Same argument you're making.

Raising interest rates slows inflation. The BOC (Bank of Canada), who control interest rates is not under the PM's command. Raising interest rates will make home ownership more expensive (payments will be more) and less people qualify (payments more) and might help thus, lower prices due to less people being able to afford homes. Which way to you want it? Do you want the BOC to increase the rates or not? Consider the effects of that, now that you know how this works.

The PM doesn't build houses. Developers build houses. The PM has no control over developers.

"After nearly 7 years of looking, first in Georgetown, then Guelph, my wife and I came to Kingston. We looked at house after house for our perfect place only to see prices increasing at an ever faster rate. When we finally pulled the trigger on buying a house, just before covid, we ended up with a semi backing off the train tracks in the heights. If we had waited any longer, we wouldn't have been able to afford anything and even still, we have my mother living with us to make everything work.  


We feel very fortunate but also very sad. Not only for us, but for anyone that didn't squeak into the market before any opportunity shut closed for most people. People talk about it crashing someday but even if it dropped by 30%, it still wouldn't mean a flood of affordable housing in Kingston. Growing up, the rule I was taught was 3.5x gross household income was what you should consider and now I hear people getting as much as 5x from mortgage brokers to buy places. Even still, it's hard to get into the market here. If you have two working people making $45k each, that's $90k gross or $450k to buy a house (at 5x gross income). You'd need to have saved up around $25-30k for downpayment and other fees and would end up house poor and in a situation where if anything happened, paying the bills would be difficult.  


Recently, I was looking at apartments wondering what the market looked like if we decided to sell and move back to renting, but it doesn't make any sense. It would cost us the same, we'd have less space, and we wouldn't have any equity. The whole thing is insane and makes me sick to my stomach.",t2_3ohq,phoenixfireball,0,1648215987.0,0,t1_i22bpfi,i22bpfi,True,cbcmichelle,t3_tmowfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tmowfi/are_you_looking_for_housing_in_kingston/,Are you looking for housing in Kingston?,/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tmowfi/are_you_looking_for_housing_in_kingston/i22bpfi/,3,r/KingstonOntario,0,3

"Absolutely. If you need to hear tenant voices have you joined the Ontario Tenant Rights group on Facebook?

Are the brokerage companies raising these rent prices so drastically Canadian run property companies or are they corporations from other countries buying our properties and raising the rent so high for their own prerogative with no concern or repercussions to how it is directly impacting our housing crisis or state of emergency related to homelessness?

Please investigate that related to the Kingston region.

I'm genuinely curious what you're picturing.  I have spent *thousands of hours* over the past 6 years wiring, plumbing, sanding, fiberglassing, woodworking, scrubbing, sealing, canvasmaking, and rebuilding systems.  Does that sound like luxury?

I live in a cramped, self-contained tiny home and use virtually no electricity or fuel.  It is my only asset.  Each winter, I live with a different group of student roommates.  Lap of fucking luxury, am I right?

"About a month ago my husband brought home some virus from work. He wears a mask all day, works outdoors, and we're both fully vaccinated. 

He was run down for a week and developed a nasty cough that still isn't gone (though it is much better). I was rundown for about a week, had the worst sore throat that I've ever had (it was like I was swallowing crushed glass 24/7 for about two weeks), and a cough that is still kicking around. Neither of us developed a fever, though we both had hot/cold flashes. 

Did a drive by strep throat test and it was negative, so I started taking the at home covid tests every two days at my doctor's suggestion. Five tests have come back negative and our two unvaccinated children haven't gotten sick, so at this point I'm somewhat confident that it isn't covid and there's just a really nasty bug floating around.

Nope.

"Are you Indigenous? It's a colonial bridge. This whole city is a colonial settlement. You can call it whatever you want. It's just white people trying to act woke.

Agree with others here that the text colour and font choices mean the site just not legible right now. The wide spacing between letters is particularly vexing.

Honestly I'm more concerned that she ""needs to ask her parents"" _permission_ to meet people. That's unhelpfully over-protective for a person of that age.

edit: quoted for context and continues:

Seriously, I get the protectiveness, but at the same time, are we fighting for women to have equality... or not? Should 19 year old women be prevented from freedom to associate?

"I am completely out of your social interests (Dad's age). All I can suggest is KSSC, Queen's or St. Lawrence social groups, and ... if you're looking for work also, the Armed Forces Reserves have some great people, hard work, and interesting challenges. They get a lot of recruits in your age range, and the work blends well with and accommodates academic needs. I was in for almost 12 years. Loved most of the people I worked with (nowhere is perfect) and have made friends for life in various age groups. Also the Cadets have need of staff and youth groups always benefit from more staff and volunteers (Boys & Girls club).

Sorry, that's a bit more of a recruiting pitch than I meant it to be, but it's all I've got. Questions welcome.

Oh! There's also bumble/bff, instagram, (app of youth today... tiktok?) Post the same, express your interests (not personally identifying stuff), and ask some older people you _trust_ to like/share it with younger people  they know who'd maybe meet up.

"""What or why is the NOTMAR out there, and why does this stop people from anchoring out of Kingston?""

One of the main things that stops boats from anchoring out in Kingston, is that it is just not a good place to anchor for pleasure craft. There is very little shelter and water is deep. 

Inside the causeway was one place, but is that part of Kingston Harbour? It does seem to be controlled by Kingston Marina. How did they get the right to do that?

Another place, is inside the Confederation breakwater. Boat did anchor there, but then some started to anchor there permanently and not pay anything.  That might have been one reason for the NOTMAR.

How about over near Garden, Wolfe and Simcoe. Is that not still Kingston Harbor? Quite a number of boats overnight in the bay at Simcoe.

Elevator bay is another option, but not too convenient. 

The docking fee is over $2/ft in Kingston as well as in Gananoque. A 35ft sailboat would cost $70+/night or more if services like 30A power are required.",t2_t3ymm,andysvan,0,1647995465.0,0,t1_i1qgfrj,i1qgfrj,False,lovin_life0,t3_tk9cpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tk9cpa/abondoned_boat_finally_removed/,Abondoned Boat finally removed!,/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tk9cpa/abondoned_boat_finally_removed/i1qgfrj/,1,r/KingstonOntario,0,1
