"True.  Well Chesapeake was never really a community to begin with.   Too big of an area for that.   If you want a community in this city,  look at the poor areas.   The areas with actual detached housing.  Not the areas with the McMansions. It's a big ask of cities like Chesapeake and Virginia Beach to have neighborhoods. Too often it's whatever climate the developers or the neighborhood associations create.   No independent housing in the wealthy areas, so it is what it is.   

Chesapeake is more of a suburban wasteland with one development after another.  When the developers are the inmates running the asylum you get cities like Chesapeake and Virginia Beach.

"If you are only commuting once a month through the tunnel, and especially if your meeting isn't like 8 or 9 in the morning, you wouldn't need to rule out a house on the pennisula. Commuter traffic can make it your commute around your hour-and-a-half limit going to the meeting, but you won't regularly hit longer than that until your way back, especially if you leave work before 3:30 or so. I absolutely don't want to downplay the annoyance of the tunnel, but actually you are more suited to deal with it than 90%+ of workers, and so you may not want to rule the pennisula out entirely. Hampton has a particularly awesome family attraction called Blue Bird Gap Farm which is free but is clean and wholesome and very fun for younger kids. Newport News has the Virginia Living Museum which is not free but worth it; it's a combination nature museum and native species zoo.

You also mentioned quiet and space, though, and that's not really a strength of Hampton and especially not Portsmouth. Suffolk would be the way to go to prioritize that, or even further out that way in the nearby counties, like the Smithfield area you were looking at. You have a commuting advantage and don't have to pay the extra to live in Chesapeake or Va Beach like those who drive every day would value more. For low density on pennisula, York is very expensive and Gloucester is way too far. And Williamsburg is of course both. But if that's not a must, you may well decide that Hampton, Portsmouth, or Newport News suits you well enough with a combination of a modest yard and proximity to parks and bike trails.

Crime patterns: Newport News, which I know the best as far as localities, avoid any street with a number! But tbh, the really best way I know to find a safe area, is to go on sites like [https://www.greatschools.org/](https://www.greatschools.org/) since there's a strong correlation between safe neighborhoods and good schools, and you'll probably need to know what the schools are like anyway.

"Thank You for the information about the tunnel, I really need to consider that. I drive through it on weekends but that would be bad to have to deal with on a week day especially if it made me late for work. 

I can't find any houses in my loan bracket in parts of Suffolk right now I would want to live in on the MLS. I check twice a day to see if anything will show up. Suffolk is a preferred area, lots of space, trees, James River. I  would definitely move West slightly more rural because I like quiet and space. I do like Smithfield and out that way.

Portsmouth and Hampton had some really nice houses in my loan bracket and some of the neighborhoods looked nice, like older home owners, quiet streets with large trees. I like that the water is nearby, and I like some of the parks over there, nature areas. 

I moved to Virginia right before Covid hit so I didn't really get to learn much first hand about the areas.  The areas I go to just all seem nice. Then, I told some of my neighbors I was looking into some areas and they are like ""that's high crime"" and I was like okay maybe I saw it on a calm day. I ask other people they say no that neighborhood is okay, so I just wanted to ask more people.

"Hampton Roads derives from the roadstead formed by the confluence of the C. Bay with the James, Elizabeth, and Nansemond rivers. As a result, it doesn't really make much sense for Williamsburg to be considered officially a part of Hampton Roads. I will say parts of Yorktown are close enough to maybe be claimed by HR but Williamsburg/HT kind of seems like it's own thing.

I'm 49 and I go in there for the nostalgia of it but I don't really like their lineup.   I might buy a pair of shoes out of there.   But they struggle with designer clothing.   They had an arrangement with Ralph Lauren on a private label a while ago that was interesting but that did not work out.   They made a real push in the nineties to stay relevant on that front.

"They still get foot traffic through there.   I go there once a week. Far more than I go to Military.   It's like the stores that are still there get a lot of traffic but most stores are closed so it looks dead but it isn't quite as bad as it seems.   

If there were just one other development in Portsmouth it would be the nail in the coffin. Logistically,  the location of the property relative to what's actually on the Portsmouth side is the major advantage.  So it benefits because of a lack of options in Portsmouth.   If you're on the Chesapeake side it makes more sense to get onto 64 and drive to Greenbrier.   

I would go to MacArthur but I see no need in paying the toll for the downtown plus paying for parking.   Once Nordstrom left there was no real reason to go.  Plus the movie theater at Chesapeake is actually open which says a lot as Cinemark at Military has been closed for a while.

"TL, DR

Something is going happen in Chesapeake Square Mall where JC Penny used to be at. 

Seriously that's it. 

I can say from personal experience they're building residential in the empty field between Red Robin and Wal-Mart.   They could do the same with the mall personally.   It's a strange place to build a 5 over 1 but that's what they're doing.  At least you can walk to Wal-Mart and Target from there.

My kids went to Hidenwood for two years.. it completely had them so behind. The school is terrible and dropped in rating from a 2/10 to a 1. The teachers hate it there (I volunteered once to help with picture day and they were all screaming and saying how much they hate their job and the kids not realizing I was a parent and not the photography team). My kids teachers would miss school on purpose and threaten the kids to never come back . The kids were pretty intense and lacked any manners. Bullying was not addressed. The office staff was nice though. It had some nice teachers in the lower grades .

"This. So much this. 

I would also say, racial tensions can sometimes be very high in Hampton too. Hampton is majority black, which I loved growing up in. If diversity matters to you, Hampton is fantastic. However,  there is a lot of...not necessarily red lining...but there can sometimes be divisive neighborhoods stemming back from the Civil rights era where some old neighbors really think this is ""their"" neighborhood 🙄

 Lots and lots of poverty in Hampton: 15%, so 1 or 6 people live in poverty, and same ratio for children under 18 - 1 in 6 kids live in poverty. 

As a kid, I recall lots of unstable family dynamics with my peers - divorce, abuse, kids living in a rental for six months (or as little as one month) and then just ""disappearing"" from my life (they had to hop somewhere else). Of my childhood friend group, 3 of 5 best friends got pregnant as teens, and only one went to college. Just...not a lot of positive role models or growth.  Hampton has a huge ROTC community, so lots of high school kids who want a way to move up/out tend to follow that route. 

Hampton is very very very pro military if you have any strong feelings about that too. 

There's things I love about Hampton. Downtown Hampton has amazing facilities. The water is beautiful and easily accessible, say compared to someplace like NN or Norfolk. I love how small the city is, you can know people from all over the city and run into them as you just do errands around town. Buckroe Beach is a jewel as is Fort Monroe.

"Hampton schools are kinda overrun. The administration don’t support the teachers much. Basically the kids can scream and act out and call teachers names and hit the teachers without much consequence at times. My ex-wife taught there and I grew up there moving from different parts of Hampton. The high schools are Phoebus, Kecoughtan, and Hampton High. I used to hate Newport News and think it was sketchy…..which kinda is in some parts. But once I moved to NN, whenever I look back at Hampton, I  just shudder. 

Also, Hampton has had political issues for decades. The city managers battle the elected city council, etc. There’s almost no room for growth as it’s a smaller city completely locked in by the York River on one side, Newport News and York County land locking it on others. Not much investment going on in most places and no room to grow causes Hampton to stagnate which affects funding for old, dated school systems that haven’t changed since I was attending decades ago. 

There are a lot of racial scars dating back to the Civil War itself. They finally changed the one local highways name after all the BLM protests shut down traffic. It was named Magruder Blvd. General Magruder was the Confederate General that upon having to evacuate Hampton when the Union was coming, burned down the entirety of Hampton so the former slaves being protected on Union enforced Fort Monroe would have no where to seek shelter. After the war, all the whites also came back to burned down Hampton and thought, “what a hero” for preventing blacks from finding shelter. So theres a lot of deep seated issues that date back even centuries. 

I grew up in Hampton and can’t believe anyone would say the schools are nice. Teach somewhere like York County, James City County on this side of the water or else Suffolk, Chesapeake or even Virginia Beach on the other side of the water. And live near where you work. You DO NOT WANT to be daily commuting through the tunnels and even now the James River Bridge. So many people worked on the Peninsula (Hampton, Newport News, Langley AFB, York County) but hated living here so they all built houses/subdivisions in Smithfield and Suffolk and now commute across the JRB making that commute a nightmare.

"Hampton Roads is a region consistenting of the seven sister cities, Hampton is one of those cities. Hampton might be...one of the worst of those cities (I say as a former Hamptonian).

The great thing about HR for a person not from the area is that....everyone is not from this area. Due to the military, lots and lots of transplants live throughout the region so its not like you are walking into a locality where ppl are ride or die Hampton/Virginian/Southern or make it difficult for transplants to settle down. 

Each sister city is really unique, depending on what kind of lifestyle you want. Do you want rural? Do you want a city? Do you want suburbs? Do you want a blend of both? 

The only thing I hate most about the area is traffic. Its one of the most congested areas in the states and during rush hour it can take awhile to get from area to area, so if you work on one side of the James River it would be best to live on that side of the James River. 

However, tons of beaches, wildlife preserves, hunting and fishing if you are into that, outdoor sports, racing, sports lifestyle no problem. Tons of musical acts go to Virginia Beach and the Norva in Norfolk, so you can have some fun.. Theres lots of festivals too.. 

If you care about schools, Williamsburg, Yorktown and Chesapeake, Virginia Beach are probably where you should lean. There's middling results in Newport News.

"Does the Tide still only oscillate between First Baptist and Ft. Norfolk? If that’s the case, then this is dead in the water. I know they have the same Mayor who has been saying no to basically everything ever since he was a councilman. So maybe it’s even deader. 

I don’t take pleasure in shitting on this effort, but I’ve been there the first time I lived here. The tide needs support of the VB leaders and it must go to NOB. The logistics are tough, but if it doesn’t go to the base then what’s actually the incentive for anyone in the Beach?

I remember ten years ago seeing a proposal that had light rail going down the middle of lynnhaven/volvo to connect greenbrier and green run. I remember seeing people hopeful they would replace service roads on laskin with rail. But the fact is VB is full of pearl clutchers who just aren’t interested in improving the infrastructure of the region. To them, rail represents increased accessibility of people they don’t want to see. They’ll never tell you to your face, but they also don’t shy away from talking about it in the middle of a Starbucks or wherever you may have the misfortune to run into them.

">What's the metal scene like out here? I would love to attend some concerts this year.

I'm not entirely sure, sadly.  I'm an old fart who doesn't get out often anymore.  I'm up in Yorktown, and it seems most of the shows are on the south side.

I know there's a venue in Chesapeake that has some metal/hard-core shows regularly.  I think it's usually local bands, but I've forgotten the name.  Always wanted to check it out, but never got the chance.

Richmond seems to have the larger metal and goth/industrial scenes it seems (normally Fallout or Broadway I think).

As for gaming, there's pretty good communities around Hampton Roads for all kinds of board, card, and rpgs.

Depending what side of the water you're on, there's the Funny Bone in VA Beach and Cozzys Comedy Club in Newport News.  The Funny Bone typically gets more the A-lister headliners, Cozzy's is more of a hole in the wall/lesser known acts, but both are decent venues for a visit.  


The Virginia Living Museum and um...others? in Newport News are decent.  I don't really do the south side often at all.

Sadly, I can't help on the more 'high brow' entertainment.  I've not seen a play since high school and I've never watched a ballet.

"> They are renting a room and that includes equal part of the shared living space which would be reduced by an extra person living there, it’s not a hard concept and is standard. 

You don't seem to understand how room rental works in Virginia. The only thing that is rented is the actual room. If there is a bathroom that they share, it will be stated as such or if they have it to themselves. Other areas of the house that may be perceived as ""shared"" are house privileges and are not rented. This is usually dictated in a contract for room rentals.

>If they don’t have a lease, they are a shitty landlord and I’m not going to assume that of OP.

That's an inane assumption. I've known several people without leases with someone for years that have worked out just fine. I wouldn't recommend it but calling them shitty? That seems pretentious at best.

"Personally, I hate it here (I live in NN, but I also lived in Hampton), but that has to do with the fact that I prefer to live in large cities/heavily urban areas (or in rural environments) and can't STAND suburbia, esp. the chain-restaurant, strip mall, & sprawl that's so prevalent around here. It also doesn't help that I'm a radical pacifist living in the most militarized area in the world where almost everyone has some connection to the military.

I mean, I like my neighborhood, I like my neighbors, I like a few of the restaurants (Pho 83 is the best banh mi I've ever had), and I sure do like the cost of living (I had to move out of my preferred city because, on disability, I couldn't afford to live there anymore, esp. with housing costs), but for the most part, I wish I could move home. (It also doesn't help that we had a HORRENDOUS move (signed 3 leases in less than a year) and less than a year after we got settled, COVID hit and with us & our entire family being high-risk, we went into lock-down and pretty much haven't come out since. I've made 1 friend since I got here & I met them online & it was a total coincidence that they live in the area.)

I wish I could afford to live in Williamsburg (a place I've been going to since I was 3; my grandparents lived there & it feels a lot more like home), but there's SO little affordable housing and the stuff that is there is snatched up by college students (and 1 management agency discriminates against unmarried couples (I didn't think that was legal, but they do - they won't combine your incomes together)).

"That is an excellent question! Mrs Manning's minions show up to every single board meeting, signing up way in advance so they can share their outrage about whatever the outrage du jour is that week. You can pretty much look at other board meetings like Fairfax or Loudoun county or Chesapeake and figure out what they'll be ranting about since they all speak from the same script.

"These old cities, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Newport News, Suffolk, are experiencing gentrification which is a politically correct way of telling poor people to GTFO.  It is a slow process, but if you aren't paying attention you look up and you can't afford anything, and none of the people you grew up with are still around because they've all been priced out.  Nobody looks like you anymore.  People are wearing stuff you can't afford.  People are eating stuff you can't afford.  This is something that started to the far North of this region and to the far South and has closed in from both ends, the more recent examples being Charlotte and DC.  It will end here, which means people that can't cut it will either have to go back to the Midwest, if they can even afford anything there anymore, or go deep into the Appalachian mountains as that is the only thing affordable anymore.  And then they turn around and give people casinos which gives people a false sense of hope.  People are going to have to figure out if they are going to assimilate to this new reality and get on board or if they are going to go off of the grid.  Even $1,000 a month rent is the good old days.",t2_774ou7kn,Sure-Ad7730,0,1645740393.0,0,t1_hyatmlp,hyatmlp,True,Blazevale,t3_t0kh3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HamptonRoads/comments/t0kh3d/need_help_for_a_research_project_opinions/,Need help for a research project.

"Growth is slow.  A big part of that is the need for infrastructure.  The area does not have enough housing.  The area is also light on public transportation options; the bus is about as good as can be expected given the low ridership here but there is a need for light rail throughout the region to supplement the bus.  The issues are typical, if you build more people may use it but people are not paid enough to use much of anything.  So something like more bus routes or more frequent trips on existing routes may create induced demand for those that cannot afford a vehicle the same as more apartments may create induced demand for those that cannot afford a down payment on a house.  But if the cost to rent those apartments is high there may not be anyone to rent out those apartments to.

An ongoing argument is how entertainment options, particularly sports, in this region makes sense if people cannot afford the existing options.  For example, if Norfolk does build an arena, and ticket costs are high, which they should be because the infrastructure is new, do you go to see your favorite artist or do you wait for cheaper options?  Is it worth it to pay $20 to see your favorite artist, what about $200, what about $2,000?

Hampton Roads is turning into a place where people that already have money can park their cash at but a place where it is really difficult to obtain money to begin with.  Unless you're working in one of these industries that provides auxiliary services; computers, internet, medicine, healthcare, shipyards, television, radio, construction, hospitality; what are you really doing here?  A lot of the good paying federal jobs are in the Northern Virginia/DC area.  Really it is large enough if you can get a job there is plenty to do and enough work to go around but small enough that people still bump into each other and recognize people from some other church or some other job they worked at.  It isn't DC, it isn't Chicago, it isn't LA, it isn't NYC. But it is moving in that direction to take on those larger areas.  It is just missing the cultural forces and that feeling of being part of a large city.  Hampton Roads is still sort of that area of a ton of neighborhoods with their own distinct feeling, suburban in many parts although that is definitely changing.  I just fear that it will end up being a place with a bunch of people in front of their screens at home, making money, but that money having nothing to do with a fixed geographical location.  Yet it is enough to afford everything here.  Those that are left behind in that digital divide stuck commuting to work will get the raw end of that deal, complaining about the gas tax, complaining about the tolls, complaining about the traffic, and fighting against light rail and innovation because they're afraid it will make the area palatable to undesirables.  There is already a divide here between people that like it the way it is, people that want it the way that it was and those that want their own version of Chicago or NYC here; and you can't necessarily tell who is on what side based on whether they are native to this area or not.

If Hampton Roads wants quick growth, it is going to have to do something dramatic.  Maybe some large employer needs 200,000 employees.  Maybe there are other incentives.  A lot of those days are behind us and the region doubled down on the military and missed out on a lot of those opportunities.",t2_774ou7kn,Sure-Ad7730,0,1645739723.0,0,t1_hyartss,hyartss,True,Blazevale,t3_t0kh3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HamptonRoads/comments/t0kh3d/need_help_for_a_research_project_opinions/,Need help for a research project.

I’d say the region as a whole is slow growth. We’re heavily dependent on defense spending which keeps things much more stable so we don’t feel the full force of a recession but also don’t benefit much when things are booming elsewhere.

"This is going to be controversial, so I hope I don’t get many thumbs down 😅

The big one in our area is riverside… (though on the other side of the bridge, but many people do work and drive across for work) but I advise against it. My friends all just started there for about 26 I think. I did clinicals there for school and when I talked to the nurses there, they said you NEVER get pay raises at riverside. Ever. My current coworker told me that she worked in a speciality unit and they changed the way they paid them since they felt her unit was being “overpaid” and after 10 years of working there, she took a 30,000 pay cut and quit. 

The other large ones are sentara and bon secours. I don’t know a lot about sentara, but I heard it’s a lot like riverside. Bon secours seems really strange. I met an aide who said that while she worked there, they actually do random nicotine tests to make sure you don’t smoke on your off time. 

Those are the main hospital chains in the area. I’m Norfolk you have Norfolk general hospital (sentara) and chkd hospitals together.

"> I'm basing it off my experience... as a mortgage underwriter of 15 years.

If you are, which I'm going to give you a slight benefit of doubt here, but you are walking on a thin edge with no post history.

You are telling me that a person doing $30/hour is only capable of making up to a $1,600 per month payment while $17/hour per is only capable of up to $1,200? Something seems wonky..you say loose but the consistency is odd. 

>I've seen A LOT of positions that require a bachelor's degree, but start at $15/hr!! 

I've looked around..I see a ton of fast food places offer $15 STARTING and that is considered bottom rung. 

>For a single person with no kids, yes $60k is doable, but we aren't factoring in other bills either.

I'm factoring in other bills because I've done the calculations previously as I deal with real estate on a frequent enough basis in some capacity and it's insanely easy to look it up. You are looking at around $3,900 per month after taxes. If you think that's not more than enough to handle a mortgage, ALL your bills and expenses and set some aside then I'm also a Wallstreet tycoon for the past 15 years.

>What about single parents? Or families with multiple kids? Yes SOME people wait until their 30s or later to have kids, some don't, that doesn't change the fact that living costs, specifically housing, are rapidly increasing while wages are not.. There WILL be another housing and employment crisis unless one or the other changes.

I've clearly stated most are waiting until their 30's to have kids so the kid factor is gone and shouldn't be included. Families with multiple kids could also have other incomes and revenue streams so you are including different possibilities to throw off from the main point. 60k is well beyond what is reasonable to live in and thrive in this area specifically.

"> People need to be able to save in order to make a down payment in the first place, which is nearly impossible on $15/hour

That's not remotely true at all. I have multiple people I've known do just that. The folks that complain it's not possible usually are the ones who saddle themselves with unnecessary things. You can get a place in a less than desired area..struggle and move up. People were making $5.15 an hour in the early 2000's around here with apartments in the 800's and making it work. You are talking about almost triple the wages now but apartments have not tripled in the amount, they haven't even doubled.

>Yes it's possible to do those things, but if you don't have a degree it's not easy to find a job that pays that much

There is literally vendor/warehouse jobs open everywhere that don't require degrees that make way more than that. That's just off the top of my head. There is quite a few other places that offer higher too.

I think the disconnect is people aren't opening their horizons of what they are capable of. Possibilities in flourishing are usually things people hold themselves back with.

Something has to give, or we're going to have an exponential increase in the amount of homeless people.

Like Reagan when he sent the marines into Beirut or the Iran Contra affair? Maybe Bush sr when he increased taxes that cost him the election.. perhaps Bush jr invading Iraq when 15 of the god damn 19 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and Osama was in Syria?? How about when Trump knew china had a deadly pandemic brewing for over a month (actually more like 2 months) and sat on his thumb trying to will it away because he didn’t want it to impact the economy. And then he pumped the economy with ppp money and handouts which has led to inflation. Also he politicized the pandemic and his lack of action resulted in the deaths of 100s of thousands of Americans. Don’t get me wrong I can bash the dems too but honestly the republicans are worse.

Never have and never will. Many years ago in paper auto trader days I went to look at a mustang there. I assumed the price had been misprinted as it was thousands over what an equivalent mustang was going for elsewhere. I talked to one of the salesmen about it and he told me that it wasn’t a misprint and they wouldn’t negotiate the price. So at this point I started showing him other nicer cars going for the same price and his response was to tell me they would find some young military member to buy it. I was livid that they were flaunting the fact they were taking advantage of young military members but they couldn’t care less.

"There's a lot of students where I used to live at.  They have utilities, satellite and internet included.  

[The Brightleaf Building](https://www.thebrightleafbuilding.com/)

I was paying $1,400 for one bedroom.  2 bedrooms shouldn't be much of a difference. You'll want the apartments upstairs.  Downstairs and 2nd floor is rachet they like to turn up down there. 3rd floor is quiet; most times.  They also have a swimming pool, if you don't mind sharing water with the dogs.

Chesapeake you'll get an apartment as old as I am in your budget.  I can't speak for Suffolk.

That Virginia Pilot building is at the top of your budget.  Check it out [here](https://legendpropertygroup.com/apartments/pilot-place/).  

I would recommend it because you'll be downtown and can walk to everything.  I like Chesapeake but for a young person its real suburban.  And Suffolk is rural.  I wouldn't mind Chesapeake by the malls, both Greenbrier and Chesapeake Square have new complexes under construction.  If the City starts integrating apartments within Chesapeake Square, which they could because there's a ton of traffic there, even though most people still think its a dead mall, that area would get really interesting.  Even though Greenbrier is surrounded on all sides by apartments, I think the same is the only thing that's going to save that mall.  They're only about 10 years behind Military and Chesapeake Square with respect to becoming a dead mall.

Your budget is going to get you rehabilitated and renovated apartments.  Those are the only places in the region that offer utilities included.

"You would still be given the opportunity to apply for other advanced programs. Overall, I would suggest the apprenticeship if you've not yet got a degree and/or are looking for more experience, since it would open up more doors for you.

"Friend of McFly, I went through the M&S program recently - graduated a little over a year ago. Feel free to ask any specific questions, here or DM. I don't know of the department's future plans, they haven't really been bringing in apprentices the past two years or so, only one other guy.

You would first go through a trade department, two years of that as an hourly and taking classes at their school. If your grades and performance are good, you'll be given the opportunity to do ""Pre-Advanced"" for a year, which would have you taking classes through TNCC while continuing to work your trade. If performance and such is still good, they offer advanced trades, which are the salary engineer stuff except for Dimensional Control, which is hourly iirc. The advanced route adds on two more years, so approx five years up to this point

First youd have to hope that ModSim is offering a spot or two, then youd have to compete with other apprentices for a spot. You'd apply to it like any other job (resume/interviews). When you're in, you'd take classes through TCC, and as another post mentioned a lot of general engineering classes with the other advanced apprentices. They used to do in-house theory courses, but they no longer offer it. It was moved to TCC I think, but no idea if still offered since they don't usually get enough people to sign up.

If performance still good, you might be offered the chance to apply to Professional Development Program (PDP) to earn your bachelor's. This adds on another 3 years or so, so approx 8 years total to finish this route. I was burnt out by then, so I didn't bother.

I had a lot of ups and downs during my experience, mostly due to the nature of the work and the department dynamic. A lot of people have left over the years. 5 people laid off in the last big salary layoffs. They've not really been bringing in new people, only a few here and there. Chances are you won't really have resourceful people to ask questions to, because you're either working on legacy stuff where the original people are gone, or you're working on stuff no one has any experience with. Sometimes it's frustrating but that's any job. There are, however, also quality of life perks (work from home 2-4 days a week, parking always available at the office, usually a laid back environment, decent coworkers).

Most of the current work focuses on scheduling or process improvement. There's one small VR project for training folks on the refueling process, which if successful could bring in more VR work.

If you already have a degree or some technical experience, you could just straight up apply to the department (currently x23, was x44 and a few others but has changed a bunch since I've been with them). There have been requests showing up on the careers page every now and then for analysts and developers.",t2_89rs2,JoinedSenses,0,1644518395.0,0,t1_hweg4fh,hweg4fh,True,rdelzzz,t3_sp8q7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HamptonRoads/comments/sp8q7l/apprentice_school_modeling_simulation_program/,Apprentice School Modeling & Simulation Program?,/r/HamptonRoads/comments/sp8q7l/apprentice_school_modeling_simulation_program/hweg4fh/,7,r/HamptonRoads,0,7
"The Apprentice School has changed a lot recently. I don't know if this applies now. When I went through, if you transferred into the Apprentice School instead of a new hire, your pay level was frozen until the rest of your cohort matched your level.
