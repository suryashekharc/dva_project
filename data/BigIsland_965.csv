"Aloha /u/UncleCatDad, and anybody else interested in what to do with visitor questions.

>  I remember there was a weekly or monthly thread for these posts. 

Indeed, you remember correctly. I decided to stop doing this for a while (the last post was for [December 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/comments/r73enf/please_submit_all_tourism_related_questions_here/) because the volume of these type of questions decreased significantly (hello, omicron), and the ones that we do get are either not answered (if they are made in the correct place), or get answered before I get to move them. I also started getting the impression that the questions asked in the monthly visitor question thread were far less likely to receive interaction than questions posted directly to the subreddit. 

Seeing this topic pop up, and judging from the comments, I am happy to restart the visitor topic again. I think it will be more efficient (mostly less time consuming for me) if I would change the following things compared to the previous series. 

* Make it a yearly topic (comments/questions sorted by ""new"") .
* I completely understand wanting to share your knowledge with visitors, a BIG thanks to all of you who are doing so! Last time around I made sure to copy those responses with username mention when I would move the question. This time around I may skip that sometimes.
* I will delete any comment that is not directly helpful w.r.t the question asked.

"Aloha /u/UncleCatDad, and aloha to everyone else here participating in the post thread! 

I appreciate you expressing your concerns, and please know that we‚Äôll enter into moderator discussions about bringing back the monthly visitor questions and answers stickied post. 

Anytime anyone has a suggestion or concern, please feel free to send us a modmail. That‚Äôs one of the quickest ways for us to address suggestions, ideas, and concerns. 

[Here‚Äôs a direct link.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/BigIsland)

As volunteer mods, we genuinely listen to what you all think is best for the subreddit community. We‚Äôre always welcome to hearing how we could strive to do better, or ideas about improvements we can make here. We‚Äôre here to be of assistance to you all!

I too have noticed a recent uptick in visitor questions. We initially removed the monthly visitor mod post due to Governor Ige asking that tourists reconsider visiting Hawai ªi nei during the peak of the Covid outbreak happening. 

But seeing as though things are leveling out, and that most Covid restrictions are being dropped this weekend; it makes sense to bring it back again as we‚Äôll almost certainly see a high level of tourists and visitors this summer and beyond. 

The /r/BigIsland community has always been so kind and helpful when visitor questions are asked. And for that a huge mahalos! 

We don‚Äôt necessarily want to discourage visitors from asking questions, but absolutely understand the regular participants here not wanting to see this community flooded with those types of inquiries. We seek to find a balance between the two, and the monthly visitor post thread is a good way to achieve that. 

Also, as a side note, if you ever see anything that breaks the subreddit community guidelines and rules ~ or the rules of Reddit ~ please report it. 

Feel free to leave any other subreddit suggestions in the comments here too!

Myself and /u/Lovebigisland will talk story about this, and hopefully have things worked out by next week. Mahalo for your patience and understanding. And mahalo nui everyone for making this subreddit community the incredible place it is!

"A few days ago someone posted asking for affordable restaurant recommendations and got a lot of good replies. Born and raised here, when friends visit we usually hang out at the beach, pack a cooler with poke and beer and head to Kua Bay (as soon as the gate opens), or Hapuna (can be windy), or Makalawena if they want to hike or we want to 4-wheel drive it. 

The faster drive to Volcano is at least 2.5 hours from Kona, you should be dressed for a rainy hike, and the lava glow‚Äôs only visible at night, but it‚Äôs worth it if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. The slower route to Hilo (on the coast) has some cool places to stop and eat. You could stop in Honoka‚Äôa and get Malasadas, and I think Umauma Falls (waterfalls and cool tropical foliage) is worth a pit stop. 

Another thing that‚Äôs free, but you have to check that it‚Äôs open while you‚Äôre here, is to go to the Mauna Kea summit at night for stargazing. It‚Äôs cold and high-altitude btw.

You might want to look at R1 road. It goes all the way around Mauna Kea and winds up at the Onizuka Visitor Center. It‚Äôs long though and remote as hell on the back side. Also called Skyline road.

"No problem. I thought of a few more.

 Food storage is important. If you will have a refrigerator (called an icebox here) keep things like flour inside it or you will be grossed out to see it squirming with bugs. Also things like rice need to be stored in air right containers if can. Things go bad much faster in this climate so learning what to store in your pantry and for how long will likely be a process for you. It might be wise to bring lots of Tupperware and food storage with you or have it shipped. 
Be prepared to see massive cockroaches especially if you don't clean up any food particles after eating or if you eat after dark.

Don't assume it's safe to get in the water. Ever. Anywhere. If you don't see locals in the water don't get in. Not even your feets. You can and will get sucked out. As a general rule, If people are surfing it's not safe to swim. 

Some people might be overwhelmed if you talk a lot. I wish someone would have mentioned this to me when I was first staying with family when I lived out here. I was so excited I often talked way too much instead of just letting quiet times happen and it irritated and overwhelmed people at best. 

Don't be surprised if it is difficult to make friends. It's very cliquey and most transplants don't stay very long so local folks are often hesitant to open up to you until you've lived here 5+ years. Be persistent but not naggy with people and you'll eventually find some friends. Stay open to spontaneous visits and adventures.

You will likely need at least one good pair of rubber boots. Especially in Puna (on the wet side of the island) it can get very muddy and you'll be more comfortable if you are prepared for the rain and the mud.

Be careful. Take your time with things. Do your best to not hurt yourself or others. Cuts and scrapes get infected easily in the jungle and culturally it is frowned upon to always be getting hurt in careless ways. I had to learn to walk much more carefully and mindfully after slipping in mud and injuring my knee and realized I needed to listen more when people said ""be careful, take your time""",t2_b4mxuhtc,Puzzleheaded_lava,0,1648059017.0,0,t1_i1tqqk7,i1tqqk7,False,captainawesome1983,t3_tkhalt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/comments/tkhalt/90_days_till_the_move_tips_and_tricks/,90 days till the move.

"So a few months ago we needed our land mowed. The previous owners had not done it in almost 3 years, and my tractor and trimmer were not enough to do much of anything except right around the house. So we asked around and got a bid from Backyard Monkeys. 

When they showed up, it had been raining non stop for 10 days. I asked them if they could come another day after the water had stopped puddling. They said no. 

They brought in a larger power and left this in the yard. All those tracks you see at the top right of the image are tracks up to 16"" deep in some areas. Most of it is 6-8"" deep. So now I have massive ruts on the land, filling with water.

Backyard Monkeys wants to bring in cinder fill... at my cost of course, to ""fix the issue"". Looks like it would need two loads of cinder, but after the first big rain it would all was away anyway.

So now we are stuck. I'm thinking its best to bring in someone with a larger dozer and just re-level the whole of the land. 

This is just shy of 1.8 acres of land now turned into an absolutely horrible condition.

I've reached out to Backyard a few times, and now they are not returning my calls.

"‚ÄúBest‚Äù and ‚Äúbudget‚Äù are unfortunately mutually exclusive when it comes to coffee. It probably also depends on what you‚Äôre looking for in a coffee. As a local (in that I live here, but I‚Äôm not native), I buy cheaper imported stuff for everyday cold brew and espresso and splurge on nice things for pour overs and fancy cold brew. 

Paradise Coffee Roasters is a fantastic local roaster. They do small batches of specialty coffee but some of it is not grown here (the owner has great relationships with the producers in other countries). They do phenomenal stuff with novel fermentation methods (novel to coffee anyway). They have a small storefront in down town Hilo and give samples. They had a fancy cold brew last weekend (don‚Äôt remember which) that I wanted to bathe in.

Rusty‚Äôs Hawaiian Coffee is very nice and roasts only big island beans.

There‚Äôs also a nice coffee shop in Mountain View called Koana that sells coffee and does pour overs. They‚Äôre less out there than Paradise, so probably closer to what ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù means to some people. It‚Äôs also very good and the owner is very knowledgeable.

>Yes, You can fly a drone over private property in Hawaii. There are no federal, state, or local laws against flying drones over private properties. However, maintaining a tree line-height is important because owners have usable airspace rights above their property and flying too low over private property breaches owners‚Äô privacy, and you could be guilty of trespassing.

>Flying a drone as low as 84 feet is acceptable over private property. According to the United States Court of Federal Claims, property owners have 83 feet airspace rights above their property. If a drone operator flies their drone too close over private property. In that case, the property owners can file a complaint against the drone operator

I don‚Äôt disagree with what you‚Äôre saying.

I need to dig a bit to find proof of that. But if ~ and when I do, I‚Äôll be sure to share that information as well. 

There are a few aspects to this emergency proclamation that are, and can be seen as beyond controversial. As I mentioned previously, one of which is gathering rights for KƒÅnaka Maoli.

"Aloha /u/cookiejar327.

Apologies for not properly answering your question last night. 

Here‚Äôs the answer ~ 

Waipi ªo Valley Road Closed Indefinitely.

Waipi ªo Valley Road, which leads to one of the Islands‚Äô all-time favorite attractions for visitors‚ÄîWaipi ªo Valley‚Äîhas been closed indefinitely and will only allow residents, property owners, farmers and leaseholders into the area for the foreseeable future. 

This is to address the deteriorating road conditions and occasional rockslides, which have made the already dangerous route even more of a concern for the state. Going straight down into the valley, Waipi ªo Vally Road was already a somewhat harrowing drive, and the worsening condition of the road has been a point of concern for many locals and visitors for years.


Officials say the decision is ‚Äúbased on recommendations provided in a geotechnical assessment done on Waipi ªo Valley Road, which outlines the immediate need to mitigate rockfall and address slope instability and erosion, for everyone‚Äôs safety.‚Äù

Even shuttle tours, which were regarded as one of the best and safest ways to get down the road into the stunning Waipi ªo Valley‚Äîwhich is known for its raw natural splendor and off-the-grid appeal‚Äîwill be prohibited during this time of maintenance and repair. 

Those attempting to make the trek down on foot will also be turned away. And while it is unfortunate that visitors will not be able to visit the valley during this time, they can still see it from afar at the Waipi ªo Valley Lookout.

"> I‚Äôve seen your posts too u/pulelehua

Ah, cool! Well‚Ä¶ I wrote what I did /u/skimbelruski, because you wrote something similar in the last post I made about Waipi ªo valley being closed to the general public. 

That post that provides a video of community testimony on the subject. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/comments/teib8f/video_virtual_public_meeting_held_on_waipi%CA%BBo/

In that post, another mod also provided you with the link to the study that was the determining cause for the closure. 

Not sure if you took the time to watch the video, or read the article attached, but both are quite informative. As public testimonies on the subject vary widely, it can help understand a bit more.

However, here are a couple of excerpts from the article that are fascinating. 

‚ÄúWe do not plan on this road being closed permanently,‚Äù Roth said during the meeting. ‚ÄúThe plan is to get it fixed as quickly as possible to make it so people can get down to the valley in a safe manner.‚Äù

Roth said it was ‚Äúnever the intention of putting anybody out of business or taking away things that people had. Clearly this is just about safety.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe geotechnical risk assessment is wrong,‚Äù testified Chris Yuen, a Hilo-born former county planning director. ‚ÄúIt overstates the risk to pedestrians by about 280 times and it overstates the risk to vehicles by about 100 times. This is not a matter of engineering judgment or professional expertise this is a matter of common sense and basic math.‚Äù",t2_tysa0,Pulelehua,0,1647886967.0,0,t1_i1k7fgx,i1k7fgx,False,cookiejar327,t3_tj3hc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/comments/tj3hc2/waipio_valley_question/,Waipio Valley - Question,/r/BigIsland/comments/tj3hc2/waipio_valley_question/i1k7fgx/,3,r/BigIsland,0,3

Your comment was removed from this thread by a Reddit filter that has you flagged for potentially doxxing. Due to posting personal info such as phone numbers etc.

> Here's the right answer: There aren't any state laws regarding drone operation, Hawaii is one of the few states that defaults to federal standards for drone operation. Legally the FAA classifies drones as aircraft and its a federal offense to shoot down an aircraft. Take video and pictures as evidence if you see it landing in your neighbors property and call the Honolulu FAA office and report it. 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Our handful of police officers probably won't respond to a nuisance call but they may respond to a report about someone shooting down a drone.
Have you tried talking to your neighbor? Sometimes people just do stupid stuff out of boredom and don't mean any harm.
Here's the justified answer: This is a stupid invasion of privacy. Hit it with a stick, a net, anything but a firearm that can knock it out of the sky and then hold it ransom until the pilot comes to beg for it back. ‚Äú

The ‚Äúsacred‚Äù heiau of war kamehameha built should be dismantled stone by stone, it was built with forced labor to celebrate the upcoming colonization of the other islands and consecrated with the blood of human sacrifice.

We realize that space isn‚Äôt a factor for a website, but to create a different version for you (Hawaii 24/7) would require doing both versions.

"I considered it as a career at one time, and have known a few successful pros.  One who retired just in the nick of time says it would be extremely hard to make it as a stock photographer these days, because of the internet making a huge collection of images available for free, Plus the consolidation of licensed images by a very few. He said he got most of his business from clients who could trust that he would deliver what they wanted and could use. Which is seldom art. One of his images was used in a Windows screensaver that I know you've seen... I can't remember which image. He says that business is all but dead, and the only assignments he gets are from old customers. Yet his agent continues to license his stock -- he says his record is $75,000 total earnings from one image -- Deal is, you pay to publish it *once*, and it isn't exclusive. He says he's sold that picture many times. 

Another guy I knew -- sold me my first good camera -- went to Art Center School in LA, and went on to shoot catalog material. He says the most important thing was to work fast. Doesn't sound very much fun. 

IDK, to me the hard part about any art-oriented occupation is that there is an inherent conflict between wanting to create art, and make money. Maybe not a *conflict*, but it's definitely one thing to *make* art, and something totally different to make money off it.

"I was lucky to be living in Puna at that time, but working in Hilo.  Three memories never fade:

\- The back lanai of our home was facing towards the saddle, to watch  sunsets against Mauna Kea.  Kilauea had been erupting for a while, and when it was fountaining high, we could see it.  When Mauna Loa went off, it was also visible, and for a few short nights, we saw both fountaining at the same time.  It  was literally awesome, in the original meaning of the word.

\- The streets of Hilo that had a view of the eruption were lined with cars, filled with people watching.  Families having picnics, bruddahs drinking beers ( this was pre-DUI ), all enjoying the spectacle.  The newspaper printed a front page photo that had Pele's face showing in the smoke, overlooking Hilo.

\- The night it started, HVO was having the farewell party for Robert Decker, as he was being transferred. Let's just say more people were watching the food and drink than their instrumentation.  The astronomers at Mauna Kea were the first to visually see the eruption start, and called the HVO to tell them "" Hey guys, your mountain is going off !

"I'm currently working on getting some experience and building my portfolio!

I'm looking at about a year, give or take, to put a portfolio together, and that'll include any projects I complete through courses and getting certifications, and about 2 to 3 weeks where I'll be able to shoot in Hawaii as well

There aren't a lot of opportunities available where we're located in terms of wedding photography gigs, so unfortunately I'm somewhat limited in that regard

Any helpful insights on working towards those preferred vendor lists, or is it more a matter of experience and connections?

Pacific Dream and Flytographer look like some great resources, it's definitely helpful checking out their work and getting an idea of what they're looking for - It sounds like a lot of experience fast is what I'll be in for lol

I'm definitely open to taking on some second shooter work, it seems like that might be the best way to get some practical experience and see what it's all about

Thank you for passing those along, and I'll definitely look into the Facebook groups!

"FYI A√ßa√≠ has nothing to do with Hawai'i. It's an Amazonian plant and doesn't grow here, except for a few small farms. 99.9% of A√ßa√≠ used across Hawai'i is imported from over 7,000 miles away.

I recommend looking for places with food not only locally made, but also made from local ingredients.

Designed in Hawai'i. Assembled in Hawai'i. With ingredients from Hawai'i.

One of the biggest issues here is that more than 85% of our food is imported, the local agriculture is pushed back, not enough subsidized, and can't sustain the islands anymore. This is not only a terrible natural (or human) disaster prevention strategy but also extremely harmful to our environment.

Another important thing to keep in mind: the vast majority of animal meat is imported because there are no local slaughterhouses that could produce enough meat to meet the demand. Caution when you read ""local beef."" It is mostly not local. The vast majority of cows born on Hawai'i Island are shipped off-island (either by plane or ship, which has an enormous carbon footprint) to the mainland, then raised with corn and soy (think of deforestation for soy and the issue with monocropping and GMO to meet the livestock corn demand), then transported to be slaughtered, then packaged (massive loads of styrofoam and plastic), then shipped back to the islands.",t2_kgwuv4m2,MusicForWorldPeace,0,1647629618.0,0,t1_i16s05j,i16s05j,True,h2ogurlie,t3_tg2fpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/comments/tg2fpb/local_must_eats/,Local Must Eats?,/r/BigIsland/comments/tg2fpb/local_must_eats/i16s05j/,3,r/BigIsland,0,3

"Wow! These comments definitely do a good job of representing yourself and the attitude Hawaii doesn‚Äôt take kindly to. Just FYI‚Ä¶

This isn‚Äôt just some other tourist destination, it‚Äôs a pretty unique place with unique local residents that are getting priced out of there home because you decided to move to paradise without understanding the intricacies of place. That you think your touristy ski-resort is in anyway representative of Hawaii is just ignorant. Unless you want to talk about which Native Americans got kicked out of that ski resort hundreds of years ago your point is mute.

I wish you luck here, but you gotta change your attitude. Calling locals ‚Äòentitled‚Äô for bringing up the fact they don‚Äôt want you moving here and raising the cost of living only illustrates how ignorant and entitled you are. Thinking that locals will be just as nice to you as a new resident and eagerly ignorant ‚ÄòKamaaina‚Äô (apply for your Mahalo rewards card now!) as they were as a tourist is wrong.

I spotted your last comment, and just want to say, congrats on being the first person on the Islands we've come across that has been anything less than amazing, it's taken a while to find you!

As far as needing to learn something real - We currently own a hotel renovations business that operates nationwide, and THAT'S actually how we're able to move, in our late twenties and early thirties and not in retirement age, to an island in the middle of the ocean - Pretty cool, huh?

Believe it or not, someone having the opportunity to pursue their passions and wanting to move in a different direction in life doesn't actually mean you know anything, at all, about what we know how to do

As far as telling us to please not move there, besides being exceptionally lame, the short of it is that we didn't choose to live where we're at - We were born here. We're going to explore and follow where our hearts take us while we are young enough to enjoy it and have the opportunity.

"It's a program from art and design institutes, and like any other introductory program lol

You learn fundamentals and techniques, and get some hours behind the camera completing a few projects

It also helps to build a portfolio and some networking without necessarily being in the industry

The PPA accreditation is like any other accreditation - it's only going to be worth what the person is willing to put into it.

"Best bang for you buck is Earl‚Äôs in Waimea. Plate lunch for $7.85. Can eat at church row picnic tables under the Sakura trees or zoom down the hill to Kawaihae.

In Kona prices are higher but Pine Trees $14. Yoshino Hamburger steak plate best in the state. Spicy Garlic Chicken is bomb too. (Took a food blogger there and was blown away). It‚Äôs better than Broke Da Mouth before Diners, Drive In‚Äôs, and Dives ruined it.

If you want to drive more south. Manago Hotel $11 to $16 price range. Famous for their pork chops but everything is solid.

Hawaiian Style in Waimea is always solid for lunch. If you leave hungry you did it wrong.

"Stuff not yet listed:

**Hilo:** Hilo Bay Cafe - Best 'upscale' on island, better than any of the Kona seaside restaurants who hire washed up executive chefs who burned out on the continent. HBC hires up and coming local chefs.

Suisan - Best Poke bowl on the island because the fish was swimming just a few hours prior. Any other place tends to get their fish from here so you won't be getting it as fresh.

**Waimea:** Village Burger - Great local meat! My go-to for burgers, they even have good vegetarian burgers.

Moa Kitchen - Sushi/Ramen/Local style food. Recommend making a reservation

**Kona:**  

Much of Kona side has been talked about in other comments but one that I don't see listed is

Sun Dried Specialties - They make a 'Deluxe Fish Sandwich' which is a onion bun, crab cake and Ono fillet with some lilikoi mayo. I know other things on their menu are good but in the 8 years I've been going there, this is the only thing I manage to order. Yelpers call it the 'Crack Sandwich'.

1. Pine Tree Cafe my favorites are Spicy Garlic Chicken and Yoshino Hamburger Steak (not to be confused with their regular hamburger steak)

3. Hawaii Fresh Specialties authentic Hawaiian food. Skip Super J‚Äôs. Only open Wednesday to Friday 9-2.
4. If you are into Coffee take the drive out to Mountain View (Hilo side) and go to Koana. Tell Brian (the barista/owner) what kind of coffee you like and he‚Äôll hand select a local coffee to your taste. (Closed Sunday and Monday). It was recently voted best coffee in the state.

"Yeah, some of the bakeries I remember were just that, the classic upward mobility of first generation on the plantation, next generation owns a tiny bakery, next generation goes to college thanks to all. So many great mom and pop bakeries, sometimes taken over by young entrepreneurs from elsewhere, sometimes just shut down. 

Our timelines are a decade or two out of synch, but it's the same story. 

IDK about Chinese-American restaurants, however. I'm not the only one who considers Chinese-American to be a legitimate Chinese ""regional cuisine"". The original ones go back to the 1860s, and have been an institution in the western US since then. I'm sure some of them are multi-generational. I mean, in some tiny towns, they're the *only* restaurant, and the *only* Asian-looking family in town runs it.  The only one I was actually familiar with was a Chinese-American style, run by a Japanese-American family. I absolutely love those old places which feature things that are a fusion of the dishes their regular local customers like, e.g. Spanish chow mein.
