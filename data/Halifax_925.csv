The Penhorn development is really well-thought for transit and re-uses land that's pretty much just sitting there. I'm surprised that the accelerated process is even needed there. 

I'm concerned about the environmental impacts for the Mt Hope and Sandy Lake developments. 

The Morris Lake one is going to put a lot more stress on Portland and Caldwell for traffic. Development in that area was paused because if the lack of a planned connection between Mount Hope and Caldwell around the bottom of Morris Lake (since DND won't sell Halifax the Shearwater runway lands). Hopefully there will be an investment in transit for the Portland corridor to mitigate the traffic impact.

"I truly have no idea what that ""swimming competition bonanza"" you're referring to is. 

You stated that this Bill will cause further division, and I just still fail to see how that is so. Someone else brought up the personal information collection, and now you've latched onto that. I agree, we always need to be careful when it comes to government collecting excessive data; however, if you read into the working group, it's specifically health related. There are other working groups that collect health information to try to help people, and it's not an overreach (e.g. There's Atlantic Path, which collected all kinds of data from people to create a cancer research database.) The fact that the bill focuses heavily on getting community input is good. Marginalized communities typically aren't treated well by our medical system. They are absolutely skeptical of anyone gathering a lot of information, especially for that purpose.

Many people have seen enough Canadian and American Bills that pretend to be setting good precedent that are actually harmful. Usually marginalized groups are the first to raise concerns over new Bills, especially in Nova Scotia. Communities have consistently called out fake-activism when it comes to our governments. The only people upset right now (from what I've seen) are people of privilege who think that in the future there could be anti-white discrimination.

"Listen, you can believe what you want to. I can tell you that I completely benefit from our current systems, but I can see their faults and how they hurt people who aren't in my situation. I guess I just don't care for a bunch of hypothetical future scenarios that could make life ""harder on white people."" I seriously doubt they will ever happen. 

You saying ""turning the tide"" smells like a precursor to going full on white-replacement. White people are not under attack. Many marginalized communities have been consistently put under attack by white people for a very very long time, and the effects are seen in how our systems are structured and treat them today. 

Saying you don't trust what might come from the future if we try to make our society more equitable feels like you're saying ""if we give any minorities any help, they'll do to us what we did to them."" Do you not see how that's oppressive? That is literally perpetuating oppression. 

You are now talking about Bill 67, which is not in Nova Scotia legislature. Even so, frankly, I think that kids should be taught about racism and other forms of marginalization in an age-appropriate manner. It's important. It's reality. The way we battle discrimination is by teaching people what it is so that they can confront their own prejudices. There's nothing wrong with that. ""What about anti-white racism?"" - that doesn't exist. You're saying maybe in the future it could be, but tbh it's not really ever been a thing in history, and I doubt it'll be in the future. Also, if it somehow by some craziness ""white racism"" becomes a thing, then legislature can be drawn up and there will be existing infrastructure to show what has worked in the past. Currently it's a non-issue, but guess what is? Oh yeah, regular ol' BIPOC racism.

"Part of the reason developments in areas like this don't move forward is because the residents of these ""expensive locations"" don't want high density housing around them. It happens all the time in Halifax and the city councillors are often more concerned with keeping their jobs than doing their jobs. Just as a recent example, the Prince Albert Hotel. It was originally going to be apartments until the council fucked up the negotiations so badly that the developer flipped the table.

Later, *in the same week as the shelter protest*, they were micromanaging the fucking paint on another development. You'd think the fact that there's so much housing insecurity in Halifax that a bunch of squatters had to be evicted from municipal land would sober them enough to stop doing this shit, but no.

"So equality of outcome isn't really used to say that everyone should be a millionaire and should get any job they want. Equality of outcome seeks to ensure that everyone in a society is able to live a life without fear of falling into poverty, being food insecure, being unable to access adequate medical treatment, etc. People like to conflate it to things like ""getting jobs they don't deserve,"" but in my opinion, everyone deserves to have as few barriers as possible to live a stable life. 

There will always be outliers - people who are not able to function in society; however, the point of equality of outcome is to help mitigate the extra barriers faced by marginalized communities. You can't just go for equality of opportunity because it disregards other people's barriers to success. Look at poverty - anyone can apply for a job, but if you are stressed about not having a reasonable roof over your head, it's going to be a lot harder to be successful in your pursuit of employment. You may not have reliable access to bathing facilities for your body and laundry, you may not be able to sleep well, etc. - all of which affect your ability to focus on pursing employment.

The reality is that some people need more help in society because our systems do not value people equally. Equity is the only way. Even if it'll never be implemented perfectly, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be what we strive for.",t2_k83fguv6,cheerypeach,0,1648235037.0,0,t1_i23nooo,i23nooo,False,[deleted],t3_tnts38,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tnts38/bill_12_must_be_stopped/,Bill 12 Must be Stopped,/r/halifax/comments/tnts38/bill_12_must_be_stopped/i23nooo/,9,r/halifax,1,9

"Just read the full bill. Don't see any issues. The bill specifically indicates that all dismantling efforts will be done with heavy input from the marginalized communities it seeks to help. Only possible flag I saw was a mention of ""Race-Based Data Collection Initiative,"" but a quick google shows that it's a working group meant to collect health data from a racial aspect to look at specific health care needs. 

I seriously fail to see how this is a bill that will cause ""increased division."" Just because this Bill purposely focuses on marginalized groups, that does not mean that is somehow going to create division. Do you have any proof that this Bill is harmful?

"The only parts I can think of are more so privacy concerns:

(f) ""Race-Based Data Collection Initiative"" means the working group that is working in collaboration with the Government to collect personal information as defined in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act to address inequities and better serve racialized people by collaborating on community-level programs and initiatives;

4 (1) The Minister shall expand the Race-Based Data Collection Initiative to collect additional data to identify, monitor and track progress on dismantling systemic racism, racial disparities and instances of hate, for the purpose of advancing equity and supporting evidence-based decision making.

(2) The expansion required under subsection (1) must include

(a) the collection of data, including personal information, for the purpose of identification and monitoring;

(b) the use and analysis of information, including personal information;

(c) reporting on the use and analysis of information, including personal information;

(d) de-identification of personal information and the disclosure of de-identified information; and

(e) the secure retention and disposal of personal information.

However, if you're assuming that the evidence of systemic racism in an industry or business correlates with the number of minorities working (or not working) in said business or industry...then you do need to collect the data to quantify if this program is even working or not.  If it's properly de-identified though, the privacy risk should be mitigated though.

Although, in my honest opinion, this bill will turn into more of a ""lip service"" thing...vs actually prompting any substantial changes.  But trying to fix racism with legislation was always gonna a complicated thing anyways.

"Here's what the email said:

 
Dear former Rotarians,
 
I hope that you will take a couple of minutes to read this email - an invitation to rejoin Rotary. People leave Rotary for many reasons but we are hoping that this new opportunity might give you a good reason to rejoin.
 
As of July 1, 2021 ""The Environment"" is the Rotary 7th area of focus. Due to restructuring of Rotary Districts, there will be a new District in Rotary as of July 2022 covering all 4 of Canada's Atlantic provinces as well as St. Pierre and Miquelon. As part of the kickoff for this new District, we are starting up an e-club focusing on the environment.
 
The unique characteristics of this new club may be attractive to many people, including former Rotarians for a variety of reasons. These may include;
 
- a focus on the environment, an issue that is of great importance to many people
- meeting virtually rather than at a fixed location
- a non-traditional meeting format (not the usual meal and speaker format)
- reduced travel time to meetings
- reduced costs for meetings as there are no meal costs
- an opportunity to meet and work with people from across the new district
- possible opportunities to engage in service through the club as well as with local clubs in your area
 
People who gather to form the club will be the ones making decisions on the structure of the club and how it will run. These include meeting frequency and format, dues, projects to get involved in, service opportunities and the goals of the club.
 
This is an exciting opportunity to re-engage with an organization that has and continues to do great work in our communities and around the world. We would love to welcome you back to Rotary.
 
If you have an interest in this new club, please send an email to RotaryAtlEnv@gmail.com
 
We will soon be gathering interested people together to start the discussion about what this new club will look like and how to launch it. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us at the above email. Feel free to share the attached poster out to whomever you wish.

"That’s not what most redevelopment is though (although in this case in the story they are not likely able to add more units).

Development rules in the core were wildly changed last year. Especially in Dartmouth development was seriously constrained by previous zoning rules. This had nothing to do with demand - it was purely the city’s zoning rules. So where before you had basically no property in Dartmouth where you could build a new apartment building without special permission from Council, now you can build apartment buildings almost anywhere on a major street. So all those buildings in Highfield, on Primrose, on Albro Lake Road, they could all go from 10-15 units (or whatever they are) to 2 or 3 or 4 times more units. But that requires demolition of the small building that is there.

Agreed that renoviction to pretty things up is rarely justified, especially in this market, but we have to make a distinction when the renovation will add more housing.

I haven't yet found a nice way to remind people that other poor people aren't the enemy and the ~$4 an average earner contributes to social service programming in taxes every year isn't funding lavish lifestyles, or that the actual problem is the government gouging and abusing workers at every turn while starving those ""less valuable to society"" until they end up in tent in a park or a cremator.

">If you give your address as 123 Main Street, apartment number 3 (made up this address) there has to be some indication that is tenant insurance .

We have access to Google like everyone else would and not every building or house is clear if it's owned or rented. Sometimes a search would show that it's a Killam property for example and I know ok that's a tenants policy, but townhouses, duplexes, condos are all very hard if the person says I'm renting I do a tenants policy, sometimes too with a language barrier for someone not from here they would call their condo an apartment which makes us look at a tenants package because it's not uncommon for condo owners to rent out their condo so we rely heavily on the insured to give the info. 

If he has his policy documents it should list the type of policy, the policy limits, the underwriting info and everything on the package of documents that came in the mail when it was setup. I'd check out what's all listed there to see what is being rated for and what type of policy, etc. and then start shopping it around.

"Yes, criminals usually leave poor areas to commit crimes in downtown areas and neighbourhoods with more money. I realize that. :P

Now, after living on Pinecrest and in Highfield, plus my girlfriend living in the building on Crystal Dr where more than once I had to wait for police to allow us to go through because of a standoff - I can say that North End Dartmouth is annoying as fuck. You're probably not going to have issues, but if you do they are going to be annoying as fuck.

Except for those 2 guys who were walking home from work and randomly were murdered.

Oh yeah and those couple of random rapes and the chick who got killed on the golf course.

But anyways.. fuck that place is annoying, especially in the summer. Between losers asking you for smokes or money and kids breaking into your car for change - I am so lucky that I will never have to live there again.

It sounds a little high to me too. $20-$30 for a base policy is more normal. Depends on what riders are on the policy (eg identify theft), the insurance companies risk assessment of the building, claim history, etc.

The reason to have this insurance is only minimally for the possessions. Liability is the high risk part.

"Working From Home changed the math for a lot of people. The Maritimes had a lower cost of living, and cheaper housing, but fewer well paying jobs than other parts of the country. Now that well paid professionals can relocate here and keep their jobs, a lot of them have. Fewer people are leaving, for the same reason and because there's less work in Alberta. Plus governments around the world have flooded the system with cheap money. All of this adds up to higher demand.

Inflation is a result of a fast-growing economy, and the way to fight it is by slowing the economy down. The central banks will be causing a recession within the next 18 months, that should stop the increase in prices.

"should i have said ""everybody""? no probably not, bad reddit comment phrasing. but if you'll allow me a moment to clarify what I'm saying:

i'm not saying homeowners are bad, and im not hating on them for having a mortgage. i would like to have a mortgage one day! i am saying the following: if someone wants to defend 300k housing profit scenarios like this as a rational and fair system, i also don't want to then hear them complaining that there are people living in the parks, because the very housing system they are defending is, 100%, the root cause of encampments! the more we have an environment of houses being flipped for 300k profit in a year, the more encampments we will have. simple as that. i don't like it, neighbours don't like it, the homeless don't like it, renters don't like it, but it's reality and pretending like we can get rid of or prevent the encampments without addressing the core problems of the housing market is silliness.  


im not, and have not ever been, saying nobody is negatively affected by the presence of the camps in their neighbourhoods. they suck. we are all negatively affected when our society's housing crisis creates encampments. it costs taxpayers, it creates areas of social strife, conflict with neighbours, messy parks, it gives police the opportunity to be cruel, etc. but please, please, please realize this:  **encampments aren't going away.** they are not individual problems to be solved, they are symptoms of a wider issue. we can whack-a-mole them all we want, they are going to keep bubbling up in new neighbourhoods, in new parks, until we find a solution that meets the needs of the people in them. and we aren't doing that as a city. encampments will continue naturally occur when homelessness is this bad and the housing market is this out of reach. for a homeless person, going to an encampment and setting up a tent there seems to me to be an **entirely rational** choice made for their own safety. we must extend some sympathy to people forced to make that choice.

you can have a free market housing market that generates insane profits like this and turns 200k houses into 500k houses, which in turn become 800k houses. you can have an encampment-free city. but it doesn't seem reasonable to me to say you can have both those things at once, at least not without serious reforms.",t2_6ijdsvxh,grilledscheese,0,1648216906.0,0,t1_i22dt6o,i22dt6o,False,chippy_60,t3_tnasfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tnasfc/true/,True,/r/halifax/comments/tnasfc/true/i22dt6o/,2,r/halifax,0,2

"The landlord was stopping by his place today to make sure he has insurance ( not required till end of April). I asked my friend to ask about what everyone else is paying since the landlord should know if he is going door to door. He seemed pretty reluctant, saying if he remembers, he would ask.

Good point that it will cover someplace to stay until he finds another if something bad happens.

"Call the super they should and have all those details. They know to expect these questions as people are getting quotes for tenant insurance. Also if it's just basic coverage for contents and God for bid if something happens to the building if he does get displaced the insurance will cover his rent or hotel at another location. 

The main reason why the building insurance require tenancy insurance if really to cover themselves.  If someone started a fire in their apt or created a flood building insurance are not interested  in absorbing those costs anymore they are making landlords and property management companies get their tenants to get liability insurance

My advice best to call a few insurance brokers also call around other insurance such as TD Allstate zip sure caa and then compare apples and apples content insurance liability this way you can see what is the best for your dollar

The other reason why it might be so high is the fact if your friend never had tenant insurance or any type of insurance with insurance you have to build up a credit profile and if you don't have one it starts off high and in the past it would go lower but now this day in age it could stay the same and just continue to increase my recommendation to everyone is annually shop around don't assume that your broker is going to give you the best right because they also get a cut I recently shopped around and with my current provider I dropped it $130a year and a little less because I've opened up a TD account and now that will give me 3% less not much but better than any of the other providers and Brokers I've called around best of luck!",t2_66hnch31,partieof5,0,1648214181.0,0,t1_i227sla,i227sla,False,Curlytomato,t3_tngzpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tngzpj/about_how_much_are_you_paying_for_tenant_insurance/,About how much are you paying for tenant insurance ?,/r/halifax/comments/tngzpj/about_how_much_are_you_paying_for_tenant_insurance/i227sla/,2,r/halifax,0,2
