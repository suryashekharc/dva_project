"**[Flags of the Confederate States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)** 
 
 >The flags of the Confederate States of America have a history of three successive designs from 1861 to 1865. The flags were known as the ""Stars and Bars"", used from 1861 to 1863, the ""Stainless Banner"", used from 1863 to 1865, and the ""Blood-Stained Banner"", used in 1865 shortly before the Confederacy's dissolution. A rejected national flag design was also used as a battle flag by the Confederate Army and featured in the ""Stainless Banner"" and ""Blood-Stained Banner"" designs. Although this design was never a national flag, it is the most commonly recognized symbol of the Confederacy.

[Except you're absolutely positively WRONG.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)

 There were THREE official flags of the Confederate States of America, and NONE of them are just the design the Dukes of Hazzard put on top of the General Lee - it's just a portion of TWO of the three flags.

 For you to say that that symbol is 'southern heritage' is the same as saying the USA flag is just the stars, or just the stripes.

 Why don't they display the WHOLE flag,  hmm?

 The symbol that you refer to as 'southern pride' was only used by the Army of Northern Virginia as their battle flag.  Many other southern armies had their own unique flags, so that reasoning doesn't make sense.
  
 Look it up for yourself in that Link above.  

 _Confederate State Marine Corps, Army of Tennessee First Corps, 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles, 1st Choctaw War Regiment, Perote Guards, Army of New Mexico, Confederate Missouri Regiment- all these divisons were southern armies and none of them used as their flag the symbol you claim is 'southern heritage'._

"The idea with the new bins is to use less waste. Ifs more effective if everyone chips in and not just those in SFH. Plenty of people are making way too much garbage.

"See a doctor. If they find nothing, see a different doctor, if they find nothing, see another doctor every 3 months for a year just in case there is a problem developing that isn't showing up on tests yet. 

Non-medical things to try:

1. 10-30 minutes of sunlight, and a walk as soon as you wake up. (Sun through windows is not bright enough to trigger your morning cortisol peak).
2. Delay caffeine intake until 2 hours after waking. 
3. Diet: large amounts of food will make you sleepy. Carbs will make you sleepy. You can try some combination of skipping or eating a very small breakfast. You can also focus on eating mostly protein and fat with some vegetables for lunch. Big carb heavy meals are best for the evening when you want to be sleepy. 
4. Open a window in your workspace to make sure the temperature isn't too high for alertness and that you are not having carbon dioxide build up. 
5. Wash your face or take a shower in case you are sleepy due to allergies. 
6. Position your work so that your head is not always tilted down. Look upwards with your eyes occasionally to trigger wakefulness. 
7. Listen to a non-sleep deep rest protocol (NSDR), or have a very short nap.

"The recent rise in overdose deaths is tragic, thanks for sharing, but I see no information on heroin being the largest treatment area for ages 15-35. In fact, the information on page 11 actually shows a huge decrease in users requiring SUD treatment for heroin between 2007-2017. 

Also, the age 15-35 thing doesn't really raise alarms imo. Some people are exposed to opioids at a young age, and researchers should work to capture drug user age groups as accurately as possible. If you look at the same infographic on pg 11, it states clearly that the mean age of first use is 22, well above 15 years (although it's still tragic and sad). If anything setting the study cutoff at age 18 is worse because it completely rules out the possibility of youth substance abuse, despite young people (especially adolescents) being the most vulnerable and at-risk for chronic substance abuse. For most drugs of abuse research has shown that the earlier someone starts using, the more likely they are to develop chronic substance abuse problems. Having drugs in your system regularly will also super fuck up brain development at that age.

Pumping cash into programs that hand out cash, hotel rooms, needles, narcotics will save a couple lives at the cost of creating a permanent underclass of hopeless addicts who are permitted to camp on the street, use drugs in public, urinate defecate all over commit crimes that are not prosecuted. 

Some things are worse than death,  having been to and seen this addict encampments first-hand it's clear as day. In Portland, for example, the drug dealers in the open air scenes are a group of primarily Haitian thugs who enforce their street law with machetes so they cut off people's hands when they can't pay their drug debts.

"1) Not any less safe than a backyard injury wise, liability wise it's probably vastly riskier.

2) Almost certainly, at least until it's fenced in.

3) No idea, probably one of those 'you shouldn't and it's not illegal until everyone complains enough

4) Probably not stolen, though it's pretty easy to disassemble a trampoline if you have a couple people that know how. My brother and I could take ours up or put it down in under two hours as teens (14ft round trampoline)

&#x200B;

I would *highly* recommend not having a trampoline in anything other than a fenced yard. I had a trampoline and loved it as a teen, but we had people try to sneak into our *back* yard once or twice, out in the open you're going to have more than a few instances of local inebriates, angsty teens or kids with little common sense just come up and use it. 

That might not bother you, but I'd be very concerned about the liability aspect. When ""'Colton' from down the block' comes and jumps on your trampoline without asking and gets hurt, there's a good chance his Karen mom or jerk dad will start speaking to lawyers in short order. They might not be able to really sue you for much, but just the legal expenses you could face would be awful.

If someone gets seriously hurt, cripple or dies (not common, but trampolines *are* dangerous) you're probably at high risk of a payout.

&#x200B;

I would say build a fence first, and then even if it does bother a neighbor you can politely tell them to mind their own business.

"https://youtu.be/npXxjcG10rI : the cost of a comma

Also: (from https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/business/worldbusiness/25comma.html)

OTTAWA, Oct. 24 — If there is a moral to the story about a contract dispute between Canadian companies, this is it: Pay attention in grammar class.

The dispute between Rogers Communications of Toronto, Canada’s largest cable television provider, and a telephone company in Atlantic Canada, Bell Aliant, is over the phone company’s attempt to cancel a contract governing Rogers’ use of telephone poles. But the argument turns on a single comma in the 14-page contract. The answer is worth 1 million Canadian dollars ($888,000).

Citing the “rules of punctuation,” Canada’s telecommunications regulator recently ruled that the comma allowed Bell Aliant to end its five-year agreement with Rogers at any time with notice.

Rogers argues that pole contracts run for five years and automatically renew for another five years, unless a telephone company cancels the agreement before the start of the final 12 months.

The contract is a standard one for the use of utility poles, negotiated between a cable television trade association and an alliance of telephone companies. French and English versions were approved by a government regulator about six years ago.

The dispute is over this sentence: “This agreement shall be effective from the date it is made and shall continue in force for a period of five (5) years from the date it is made, and thereafter for successive five (5) year terms, unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.”

The regulator concluded that the second comma meant that the part of the sentence describing the one-year notice for cancellation applied to both the five-year term as well as its renewal. Therefore, the regulator found, the phone company could escape the contract after as little as one year.

“The meaning of the clause was clear and unambiguous,” the regulator wrote in a ruling in July.

But Kenneth G. Engelhart, vice president for regulatory affairs at Rogers, disagreed. “Why they feel that a comma should somehow overrule the plain meaning of the words is beyond me,” he said. “I don’t think it makes any sense.”

He acknowledged, however, that lawyers for his company might have underestimated the regulator’s interest in grammar.

“We were obviously too confident the first time around,” he said.

But this time, Rogers has turned to Canada’s other official language, French, as well as its own outside grammar expert to appeal the ruling.

Aliant, which is controlled by the Montreal-based BCE, declined to comment. But in a filing with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, it called the issue “a classic case of where the placement of a comma has great importance.”

Mr. Engelhart said the grammar fight began when Aliant told Rogers in February 2005 that it was canceling a pole agreement for the province of New Brunswick one year early. The cancellation was necessary because a local electric utility was taking direct control of poles that Aliant previously managed on its behalf.

The power company, Mr. Engelhart said, planned to “really crank up rates,” a change that would cost Rogers about 1 million Canadian dollars over that final year.

To bolster its appeal, Rogers commissioned a 69-page affidavit, mostly about commas, from Kenneth A. Adams, a lawyer from Garden City, N.Y., who is the author of two books on contract language. It disputes the regulator’s analysis of what Mr. Adams calls “the rule of the last antecedent.”

Rogers is also pointing to the official French version of the pole agreement, which has equal status under Canadian law. While differences between the languages will not settle the comma question, Mr. Engelhart said the phrasing removed any ambiguity about the contract’s life span.

“It becomes very clear once you read the French version,” he said",t2_g3sf,footbag,0,1648254192.0,0,t1_i24vyia,i24vyia,False,newsaggregate,t3_tnz1xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/tnz1xx/edmonton_oilers_sue_insurers_for_174m_over/,Edmonton Oilers sue insurers for $174M over massive pandemic losses,/r/Edmonton/comments/tnz1xx/edmonton_oilers_sue_insurers_for_174m_over/i24vyia/,1,r/Edmonton,0,1

"Because press releases aren’t necessarily honest, and a reporter’s job is to report the truth, not just regurgitate press releases. 

It would have been worth noting, for instance, that in many press releases about police shootings, media releases will note that the suspect was “in possession of a firearm” or “carrying a firearm” as a statement of fact. This particular press release only says the suspect “appeared” to have a firearm, which suggests that the suspect was in fact *not* armed, but rather was holding something other than a gun.

"That's because Ritalin is an instant-release medication that is metabolized very quickly. There are a few extended release forms of the same drug (methylphenidate) which release the drug slowly so that the effects last longer. Concerta is probably the most well-known; it is advertised as being effective for 8 hours, but in my experience it was closer to 6. The one I'm on now is Foquest, which is supposed to be 16 hours but I get a good 10-12 depending on how demanding my day is.

I used to do both Concerta and Ritalin, just taking the Ritalin later in the day when the Concerta started to wear off. I liked that arrangement because it gave me a lot of control over how long the effects lasted, but my doctor here was reluctant to prescribe Ritalin at all, so we went with Foquest.

Something to note is that Concerta is rather expensive, and the generic forms do *not* have the same release pattern (they have bigger spikes and harder crashes).

"Yea. One business burns down, you have hundreds of thousands across Canada still paying premiums without losses.

All business shut down, all of a sudden you have a claims bill to pay that’s bigger then the entire annual revenue of the insurance industry. Every insurer would go out of business and default. It would literally collapse the system. And it would have the knock on effect of affecting all banks. Banks won’t loan money on properties that aren’t insured. So they would pull all mortgages and business loans.

At the end of the day, it’s a matter of budgeting. Insurers can budget for x number of business burning down/year.

">And pandemic cover specifically would be more costly then the entire rest of your business policy combined due to how much would need to be paid out if it happens

Really? Surely there's much more likely and just as dramatic of covered perils for BI insurance than pandemics?

My business was closed for 9 months because of the pandemic. It's entirely plausible that if there were a fire at my business and the building was basically destroyed, it would take 9 months before we could reopen. But we'd be covered for that, even though a fire is much more common than a pandemic, yet causes just as much interruption to the business (9 months).

"Pretty reliable for domestic flights in my experience, but wasn't as good when I booked for Mexico. They canceled the flight a month in advance and offered a refund or credit which was fine. I booked again for a month later (Feb 2022). It was all good until the return trip, they cancelled the night before for ""unscheduled maintenance"".

"“The little disclaimers and fine print” is what make it so insurance companies can price their plans though. 

Seriously, insurance as an industry wouldn’t work if things weren’t excluded. Most insurance companies accurately price to about 99.98% of their costs based on what is and is not covered.

Where the money is made is on investing premiums before losses are paid out. And they don’t even take that money out.

"I’m aware. If they are suing though, they obviously feel like they have a good enough case to actually acquire the money in question. Whatever the title or represented contract of “all risks” is doesn’t matter if the organization feels strongly enough that the pandemic fell under that coverage. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if it is indeed covered under the insurance plan, but because of the insurance company having to pay out exorbitant values to the different organizations that fell under the plan. They’re more than likely just trying to find their loophole out.

I get that it’s very dicey with insurance because they always throw in such little disclaimers/fine print under certain situations. It just comes off as disingenuous. If the allegation is proven correct, and the Oilers organization has the coverage to claim this, then I’m laughing, because they deserve every penny of that plan.

"So “all risks” doesn’t mean it covers everything. It’s really “all risks except for the exclusions” or “all risks which we are able to cover”.

Typically in this circumstance, it’s up to the client to have read their contract they purchased. Not reading a contract you purchase doesn’t mean you can completely disregard what is and isn’t covered unless you were specifically and maliciously mislead and it’s documented as such.

Furthermore, if someone is handling the insurance for this stadium with huge insurance values and premiums, it’s usually someone sophisticated enough that they are familiar with basic insurance terminology. It’s not like a home client who isn’t expected to know anything about their policy cause they’re a plumber by day. This is a multi million dollar organization. They should have someone who can read a contract on staff.

It’s like saying “I didn’t go to the dentist cause I purchased Crest Complete Care toothpaste.” And then m teeth fell out cause I never had a professional dentist clean or look at them.  So now I’m going to sue Crest because their toothpaste didn’t completely care for my teeth.

But of course, in a free society you can sue for anything. I would be shocked if they won though.

"With great difficulty and unease. They avoid gatherings, parties, crowded spaces, elevators, public transit, and other ""normal"" places.

This meant that he was in constant danger of getting severely ill from basic shit. So he did what he had to do. He altered his life around avoiding contact with people so that he wouldn't look like a flakey skin monster and looked constantly anxious around people because at work, he had to work in groups.

If the bosses had done what they could at work to make sure he was safer there, as safe as we could reasonably make it, I would think that was probably good, even though I didn't like him, and even though it might create some minor inconvenience for our clients.

"I posted about this on another thread:

Hey I work in insurance!

You need a specialized coverage for this.

What most business have is property coverage that covers physical perils (fire, explosion etc). Then you get business interruption insurance which extends the coverage for those physical perils to cover lost revenues due to a business closing due to damage from above mentioned physical perils.

A virus is not a physical peril so therefore it’s not covered by business interruption as there was no physical damage to the building which caused your business to shut down.

So you would need a specific infectious disease coverage, or specific shutdown due to civil government authority in order to have a chance at a payout.

But wait there’s more, people will say “well why can’t you just cover everything?” Or “I wanted the best cover why didn’t you sell me that?”

Well “the best cover” means spending lots of money on stuff that’s very unlikely to happen. For example, a daycare wouldn’t purchase pollution coverage even though, it’s a cover they could technically purchase. It’s just not a risk for them and their limited insurance budget is better spent elsewhere. If everyone purchase the max cover, insurance costs would be many many times what they are today. And people already complain prices are too high!

And pandemic cover specifically would be more costly then the entire rest of your business policy combined due to how much would need to be paid out if it happens. So even if it was offered, it wouldn’t really be affordable. And I’d caution people cheering for the courts to force insurance companies to pay out on this. Because what will happen then is insurers will stop offering business interruption all together if they are forced to pay for things that weren’t covered in the contract. If contract wording means nothing, Then only solution to protect the business is to then not offer the contract.",t2_cad8n4ov,Franklin_le_Tanklin,0,1648246886.0,0,t1_i24g1s1,i24g1s1,True,newsaggregate,t3_tnz1xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/tnz1xx/edmonton_oilers_sue_insurers_for_174m_over/,Edmonton Oilers sue insurers for $174M over massive pandemic losses,/r/Edmonton/comments/tnz1xx/edmonton_oilers_sue_insurers_for_174m_over/i24g1s1/,1,r/Edmonton,0,1

"Just search for ""rubber caster wheels"" on Amazon.  They're fairly universal, and that's what I use.

I've used the plastic mats with no spikes on it on hardwood, and over time dirt/sand gets underneath.  Since it's just flat plastic on the bottom it slides around a bit as you walk / roll over it... causing the grit to scratch the floor.

I do see there are now floor mats that are essentially [a giant mousepad](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09JYZPGJ8/), with rubber backing.  I wonder if the rubber would degrade over time and stain the floor, though.

Best idea IMO, if you want something underneath your chair: Get a small, low-pile area rug and put a felt pad underneath.  Not the rubber mesh ""gripper"" pads from Home Depot (those *do* degrade and stain your floor, as I found out), but actual felt.

Edit: I have the Staples [Hyken Chair](https://www.staples.ca/products/990119-en-flexfit-hyken-mesh-task-chair-with-adjustable-arms-black), which goes on sale for 50% off on a regular basis.

"Fantastic experience! 

Ultra-low cost carriers usually fly new planes so the seats are way more comfortable than the broken down ones on the ancient Air Canada planes. If you are a BIG person you might find you are a bit cramped though as the space between seats is reduced. 

Bring media on your phone to watch as there is no inflight. Also once you are through security, buy yourself a water for the flight. It's cheaper that way. 

I have traveled with no baggage before (just a small backpack). With a backpack and carry on, as well as with checked luggage. Even with the baggage fees it's still way cheaper than your other options and might even be more comfortable for you.

Ozempic is interesting because it gave me the hunger cravings and appetite of a person with a relatively healthy relationship with food, which is something I've never experienced before.
