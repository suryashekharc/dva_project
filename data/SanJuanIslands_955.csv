"Go in September if you can. Don’t do a boat whale watching tour. It disturbs them and the babies won’t feed when boats get too close. They are endangered and need to be respected. The best thing you can do is watch them from the shore. You can get a hell of a view from land. Camp out at San Juan County Park. Go to Lime Kiln. If you really want to try to see them while you are in the water, then do a kayaking tour and hope you get lucky enough to see them. I’ve watched kayaking tour groups chilling by shore and the Orcas coming close. I’ve also been at San Juan County Park and watched an Orca pod feed for 45 minutes. They were spread out and I saw a baby with its mother feeding while the pod spread out. They breached. They tail slapped. They existed. As they started to leave, I watched two humpback whales swim by close to shore. Then harbor porpoises went by. Then we watched a seal rip apart a fish and eat it right in front of us. This was all from shore, free, and did not interfere with them at all. If you can, go in September.

"Let me start by saying I don't know the answers to all of your questions, but have some understanding of / experience with some of these things. 


There are some islands that are owned entirely by one party, probably the biggest / highest profile being [Spieden island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spieden_Island) .  I was able to visit the island that the current owner of Spieden owned before he upgraded, which at that time was owned by a Microsoft guy... a friend of mine was caring for his boats and property. Your odds of one of these islands coming up for sale on the open market may not be a lot better than your odds of winning the powerball.... having $400 million doesn't necessarily present you with that opportunity.  


Rich people live all over the county, it's not really divided up into rich / middle class / poor neighborhoods like you would expect to find in most typical urban/suburban parts of the country.  There are lots of large parcels of land, estates etc.-some owned by very rich people- spread around all of the islands... sometimes right next to a small parcel owned by a non-rich person.  Rich people tend to be disproportionately on the waterfront and in places with nice views, while non-rich tend to be inland, in the towns and other high-density zones, etc. but there is a lot of variation, variables, histories, etc. 


There are airports on the larger islands, some are large enough to handle small private jets, and small airstrips on many of the medium sized islands.  There are regular flights to/from [Seattle](https://www.kenmoreair.com/destinations/san-juan-islands/) and [Bellingham](http://sanjuanairlines.com/) a few times a day, but a lot of flights would be charter flights and/or private planes especially if you have millions of dollars.  There is also regular float plane service to the bigger marinas, and again you could charter a float plane to/from...a lot of places I suppose...I have seen people arrive onto their own private dock on a chartered float plane having just left Seattle 30-40 minutes prior.  I don't think there are regular flights to Canada -or only charters-see also Kenmore air...I don't know if this is mainly due to Covid, but I would guess that there isn't enough demand to support regularly scheduled flights.  You would need to pass customs, I don't know what that looks like for a private or charter flight... This may be as simple as calling them and telling them who you are, where you're coming from/going to, etc. which would presumably be handled by the pilot/airline.  There are customs offices at the larger ports, marinas, and presumably at the airports, but there are only a handful of officers covering these offices.


With your winnings you could probably afford a pretty nice boat which would get you to Victoria in an hour or so except maybe in rough weather.  Again you would need to check in with customs at both ends of your trip.  During typical times, there is regular ferry service between Anacortes/Friday Harbor and Victoria, although this is currently not happening again due to the Covid caused border restrictions and other Covid related strains upon the ferry system.",t2_45petbsi,OhMylands,0,1647987534.0,0,t1_i1py2vc,i1py2vc,False,Fit_Sundae_3803,t3_t7p7t9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanjuanislands/comments/t7p7t9/thinking_of_relocating_near_the_san_juan_islands/,Thinking of relocating near the San Juan Islands from WI,/r/sanjuanislands/comments/t7p7t9/thinking_of_relocating_near_the_san_juan_islands/i1py2vc/,1,r/sanjuanislands,0,1

"Living space in SJ County is being devoured by vacation rentals. The problem is reaching crisis proportions, and there are working groups in the county who are pushing for limits on these transient accommodations so that people who work there can actually live there.

Commuting by ferry is not easy, but some people do it out of necessity. The ferries are often late, so you need to work that into your planning. You may need to at least start out living on the mainland, while you work at finding a place on SJ Island.

If there are any rentals to be found on SJ Island, you'll need to beat the bushes. So: come to Friday Harbor and check every physical bulletin board in town. Talk to every realtor to see if they know of anything. Talk to your new employer, to see if they have any leads. Join all relevant Facebook groups and introduce yourself and say that you're looking for a place to live. Ask your co-workers. Keep an eye on Craigslist. Post ""housing needed"" ads of your own, in which you look charming and responsible. Rinse and repeat.

"Hello, we would be happy to explain. Our religion is unique in that people are converted when they come into contact with The Symbol, this can be through physical touch or even sight. The Symbol is in the image we posted and on our profile image here. Due to this we were able to convert all of Waldron Island by simply sending post cards containing The Symbol to every property owner on the island. Since a lot of property owners on Waldron don’t actually live there, post cards were sent out across the whole country plus Canada and the UK. In this way we are able to convert the whole island to The Viden faith.   
  
While people are converted automatically when in contact with The Symbol, it isn’t exclusive. The Symbol does not negate any existing belief and can exist in harmony with your current worldview. We encourage our members to find truth in the many positive, constructive organizations that are available to them.

Last week, at the suggestion of this member, hundreds of post cards were sent out to every resident who resides or owns property on Waldron Island. These postcards contain an image of the island along with The Symbol of our faith. Our religion is unique in that individuals are AUTOMATICALLY converted when they see The Symbol.  The back of the postcard contains a message for the residents/property owners and how to find out more information about us.

We are excited to gain so many new members and hope that the residents of Waldron Island are enriched by their new faith! You can find out more about our ancient faith at [www.thevidens.com](https://www.thevidens.com)",t2_9l8cv1rr,thevidens,0,1645024124.0,0,t1_hx6i6kz,hx6i6kz,True,thevidens,t3_sty3cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanjuanislands/comments/sty3cw/upcoming_religious_conversion_of_waldron_island/,Upcoming Religious Conversion of Waldron Island,/r/sanjuanislands/comments/sty3cw/upcoming_religious_conversion_of_waldron_island/hx6i6kz/,-23,r/sanjuanislands,0,-23

Farmers market on Saturday’s in the summer is a must. 

Check out all the parks! You can bike around fairly easily and hit most of them. My favorite park is Watmough Bay on the south end of the island. I do love Odlin Park, too. It’s classic, lots of good memories there.

"A pleasant nosh could be enjoyed with a bit of planning. 😉 Kings Market & Marketplace offer food shopping. Coho,as well as Cask & Schooner supposed to be open on Christmas Eve ; Both are local restaurants on Friday Harbor. Mayhap a takeaway from The San Juan Brewery or The San Juan Bakery, depending of course upon your arrival time at the Ferry. In addition, consideration of access to a Refrigerator in the room might be pondered.
Also do consider S'Mores at South Beach on Christmas Eve. Sort of a local gathering, However imagine a bit of a lark if your cuppa tea. One is required to bring the treats to be enjoyed though. Nicely done picnic basket & blankets should do the trick. Locals generally have an approved heating source to share. 
Enjoy your Holiday time within the Isles.

"Thanks for pulling that up.  I remember looking at that now.  So technically it seems that jet boats and jet skis with a propeller (there are some really old ones- pretty dangerous) would be excluded but powered surfboards are included. 

I also remember reading somewhere that part of the reason for the ban is there agility and speed and the fact that these made it hard for law enforcement to assert no wake zones and other maritime law. IOW, too hard to catch them. 

And jet skis sometimes bring unskilled riders that are ignorant of the laws.

As far as speed, there's an agreement between manufacturers and the Coast Guard to limit it to something like 68 mph. I know modified jet skis can get up to about 80.

"Thank you, but again I don't mean to challenge the ban.

I just like to explore the waterways, with the least amount of fuel used. Sailing has been one way to do this, but as is well known the wind and current are not always favorable from the Sound to the Strait and listening to a diesel engine for a days on end gets old after a while, so I'm looking for an efficient alternative.

A PWC allowed me to explore both ocean and rivers in another place years ago. At the speeds I mentioned it had a range of over 100 miles.  I would love it someone would market an electric PWC that would have comparable range. It doesn't need to go 70mph for me, just getting up on plane is good enough.

"i’ve got friends who live year-round on stuart, i housesit for them roughly a month out of the year and visit when i can. east stuart is very nice, it’s an interesting mix of people, most of whom are not year-rounders. folks are quiet and keep to themselves, but everyone i met was very kind and always willing to lend a hand. of course, everyone has a very do-it-yourself attitude, and many grow food, keep chickens, etc. 
it’s a hassle, but you can get most stuff done. trash and recycle are your responsibility to bring to the mainland (compost is your friend, especially if you want to grow your food). the humpback guys can bring over most anything too big for your boat, but expect LONG wait times for any repairs, installations, or the like. generator problems come for everyone eventually, so be ready! 
other items of note: there are a fair number of boats and campers in the summer, but you’ll get that anywhere in the archipelago, and with the exception of some fourth of july fun, everyone was quiet and well-behaved. east and west stuart are only connected to one another via footpath. the mail plane delivers to a communal shed most days; i had no issue with any orders or deliveries. well-behaved dogs have the run of the island—doggy heaven!—but there are otters, eagles, fisher cats, and raccoons, so be mindful if you have any pets or livestock.

"Yes, in most cases, but you'll be standing around for a little while. You'll walk off before the cars, then they have to off-load the cars and go through whatever routines they do on board before they begin to load again. 

Also, double-check the schedules in both directions, to make sure there's a sailing from Friday Harbor back to Anacortes right after you arrive. For example several days a week there's a 3 pm arrival in FH, but then the next departure isn't until 5:45.

Your question is a nice reminder that ferry rides are special ...

You can walk off and then just walk right back on. I know the ferries are a bit of a mess but you might want to consider hanging out there for a while. It’s free to get back on. The islands are expensive so I like to grab a cheap burger from the Crows Nest coffee shop and then hangout by the water. You can occasionally see seals and there are usually some cool boats you can walk by and show the kids.

"Sure!  Let’s start with ferry fees!  The ferry fare for car and driver is $75 to $115 depending on which island you go to.

And they are passing new laws right now that will create a climate change authority to have power to control and charge more fees on everything you do on your land!                    Once people move here, they want to shut the gates and stop the ferries from bringing new people here!   Our population keeps growing as old time locals can’t afford to keep their land so they sell it off in portions to the new people who in turn want to stop any more growth here!

"I don't have any obstructions, but I do have some friends that have trees around them and the have some small outages. The only times my service was unavailable was during dishy reboots (firmware updates) and when I was doing some failover testing. (Still have my Rock Island LTE service that I will ultimately get rid of).

I have had a few Zoom calls where I was getting the message of unstable network and lost audio for a second or 2, but never dropped the call/meeting. In any case, the additional $25/month over the LTE costs is a no brainer in my mind. Now if Fiber ever makes it to my house, I will probably switch, but I am not holding my breath on that one.

The speeds vary, however, I have not had an issue with watching a movie, participating in a meeting, etc. The speeds have gone as high as 300 Mb/sec down to about 50 Mb/sec down.

I’m also not sure about San Juan, but for Orcas right now, you’ll also need to be very on top of making lodging and restaurant reservations. It may be better now, but the entire summer was booked due to pent up demand.

"If you do decide upon staying on Friday Harbor Island; MarketPlace is the Grocers many locals utilise. There are several quite wonderful places to dine within the Islands as well. A picnic,weather-permitting,is another fun trek. Jackson Beach has a open-air covering,oodles of driftwood and South Beach a plethora of flora & fauna to see. In addition,a Day trip to Orcas might be a fun Day to experience. There is much to see, enjoy & experience within these Islands. The kayaking experience well done within the Islands,as well as bicycling. Simply watch for traffic,if choosing to also bicycle. The Crows Nest,in downtown Friday Harbor, is a wonderful place for a coffee and perfectly lovely food offerings; If choosing to stroll through the downtown area in Friday Harbor.

"[The Bellair bus](https://airporter.com/shuttle/schedules/anacortes-san-juan-islands/) can take you from SeaTac to Burlington or Anacortes, where you can rent a car, generally for cheaper than at SeaTac.

As u/Shades101 notes, Orcas Island is NOT set up for getting around by walking and there is only ever very minimal taxi service and no public transportation. You will need a car if you go there.

Alternatively, you could stay on San Juan Island, which has kayaking as well and where — if you stay in the town of Friday Harbor — you can get away without a car. If you were to do that, you can take the Bellair bus directly from SeaTac to the Anacortes ferry terminal and walk onto the ferry (which is much cheaper than taking a car onto the ferry) and then walk off at Friday Harbor.

You’ll probably have to fly into SeaTac and rent a car.

"I think the easy way to sum it up is ""not viable for daily commutes."" The direct ferry takes ~an hour, the milk run takes ~2 hours. Unfortunately there have been lots and *lots* of ferry cancellations lately. 

The drive from the Anacortes ferry terminal to Bellingham is just over an hour without traffic. If you're taking your car on the ferry, you have to get there early enough to get on. I realistically budget 3 hours from town to Bellingham on the ferry assuming everything times right and there aren't big delays.

Walking on is more reasonable and doesn't require getting there super early, but then you have to figure out where to stash a car on the mainland side and are still at the whims of the boat schedule and any cancellations or delays. In the winter especially (but also sometimes in the summer), the early morning ferries can get delayed because of heavy fog.


Your other option for getting to Bellingham quickly is by flying, but that gets expensive quickly if you don't have your own plane and license.

"I urge you not to take your car to the island, it’s a great place to walk around, rent a bike, hire a taxi…taking a car On the ferry is asking for long waits due to overloads when you could just walk on.  There are four parking lots at the ferry terminal.  

If you don’t want to drive - You can take the airporter bus that leaves from downtown seattle convention center and drops you off at the Anacortes Ferry Terminal So you don’t have to leave a car in Anacortes.  It’s a big comfy bus to Mt. Vernon then a smaller shuttle to Anacortes.  

You can take the Clipper (clipper vacations) from the waterfront in Seattle to Friday Harbor directly and they have an additional whale watching tour That begins shortly after they arrive in FH.

You can go to Port Townsend and take the Puget Sound Express whale watching boat to Friday Harbor

And last but not least - and very expensive - Kenmore air can fly you directly to Friday Harbor in a sea plane from the shore of Lake Union or Kenmore or you can take a plane from Boeing field, Seatac, etc.  

I suggest you call the whale watching operation you’re interested in and do your booking over the phone - you’ll get more information that way.  

Same with hotels.  Call and get good up to date information about the best rooms, restaurants, to find out what’s open etc.   and…to find out if they have a shuttle to get you to and from the waterfront.

The ferry travel simply involves lots of patience, bring stuff to do while sitting inline. Luckily I can work anywhere with a laptop and an internet connection, so that helps. We have also bought a 12V DC fridge/freezer and keep that in the car so we can bring food with us (groceries are more expensive on the island as you can imagine), so no worries about stuff spoiling/melting while going back and forth. We try to get most of our stuff at Costco the day of the trip to the island, at least what makes sense.

We also buy the 5 time pass for travel (good for 90 days), it does reduce the cost of travel quite a bit.

"This is a bad year to ask because the ferry system has had unprecedented number of cancellations and issues. 

When the ferries are operating normally the answer to your question really depends on the frequency of travel. I know people who commute to Bellingham every day, but they keep a car at each terminal and walk on.  Those people spend 3-5 hours a day commuting (between driving, waiting at the terminal, and riding the boat), and even though half of that is spent on a ride through the San Juan archipelago it seems pretty burdensome to me. 

Seemingly simple appointments can turn into all-day affairs. Last week I was gone from my house for 8 hours to attend a 10 minute dermatology check up. 

Air travel planning is impacted much more than I anticipated because you’re relying on aligning two quantized schedules back to back.

* [Herb's Tavern](https://www.yelp.com/biz/herbs-tavern-friday-harbor) - Pretty quintessential ""small town tavern"" vibe.  Haven't personally been in in about 15 years but it's a bar with drinks and it's been there for at least 50 years so they're doing something....not wrong, I guess?

* [The China Pearl](https://www.chinapearldining.com/) - Once upon a time at least 20 years ago, the restaurant was good but that ship sailed long ago.  However, the upstairs 'lounge' served stiff, if not always good, beverages.  Again, it's been a while but I can't imagine much has changed.  I did get very drunk and make one really good shot in a game of pool there once. 

Activities are going to be a bit more varied but will almost certainly require a vehicle since many of them are not in Friday Harbor itself.  

* There are two historical parks on the Island related to the time it was occupied by both American and British Military detachments for a number of years...because a pig got shot.  No lie, it's a thing. Here's the National Park Service [page](https://www.nps.gov/sajh/index.htm) for you.

* There's also a number of Whale Watching tour [options](https://www.visitsanjuans.com/whale-watching) available.

* If you want to risk your life and make the locals despise you the moment they lay eyes upon you, you can always rent one of the 'Scoot Coupe' options from [Susie's Mopeds](https://susiesmopeds.com/).  In all seriousness, Susie's has been around for a long ass time and is a huge tourist draw for day trippers.  That said, don't be a dick or an idiot if you do rent a trike or scooter and you'll be fine.  Probably.


Like my 'Dive Bar' notes on Herb's, I don't have much recent experience with a wide variety of dining options but I can say that both of these restaurants served me nice food at reasonable prices and had a nice selection of beverages as well.

* [San Juan Island Brewing Co.](https://www.sanjuanbrew.com/) - Newer Brewery/Restaurant.  I've only had the burgers there but they were yummy.  A bit of a walk from ""downtown"" Friday Harbor but, let's be honest, it's still only about 15 minutes from the ferry landing, if that.

* [Cask & Schooner Public House and Restaurant](http://www.caskandschooner.com/restaurant) - Had the Duck Gnocchi the last time I was up on the Island and it was delicious.  Paired it with a sour or cider they had on tap it was delightful.

That's just a few things but, honestly, San Juan Island is a beautiful place but, remember, Friday Harbor is like Amity Island in Jaws, it's a tourist town first and foremost during the Summer.  So you'll probably have more options available than if you went during the off season but you'll also have a lot more people, mostly tourists who don't know what they're doing or where to go either, to deal with.",t2_3vk5q,throbbingrocket,0,1628030801.0,0,t1_h7lz1iv,h7lz1iv,True,finalcutlery,t3_oxbpgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanjuanislands/comments/oxbpgt/favorite_small_islands_for_boating_and_camping_in/,Favorite small islands for boating and camping in the San Juans?,/r/sanjuanislands/comments/oxbpgt/favorite_small_islands_for_boating_and_camping_in/h7lz1iv/,7,r/sanjuanislands,0,7

"A few times we've been going across (up through Rosario Strait), and we'll happen on some Orcas.  This has happened every once and a while for decades.  You cut your engine, and idle until they leave, simple enough.

Over the last 10 years or so (probably more), the experience has changed a lot.  Specifically, if you see the Orcas, you're VERY SOON going to be swarmed by the tour boats, like they were vultures.

Fast currents, undertows, riptides, extremely cold water, submerged deadheads moving faster than the surface waters, kelp beds, inattentive powerboaters, rutting deer... it's just not worth risking your life for a swim.  Most divers apparently won't go in the waters without at least a 7mm wetsuit, for instance, and all the divers I've seen around the islands operate from dive boats as well, for safety.

Virus to blame for deer foaming at the mouth, dropping dead in the San Juan Islands

A state wildlife veterinarian says it’s likely the San Juan Islands became the epicenter of an outbreak of a fatal deer-transmitted virus because one of the animals was swimming from one island to another.  (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times, 2018)
Since late May, Aimee Beveridge, a retired geologist, has discovered three dead deer on her Orcas Island property.
Over the past two months, residents across San Juan County have reported unusual numbers of sick and dead deer. 
An overwhelming “cadaverine” stench hung in the air on Aimee Beveridge’s wooded, 10-acre property on Orcas Island, a destination better known for salty sea scents or its fragrant firs.  

“I’ve got another one to go find,” Beveridge said with a sigh during an interview Friday. “I can smell something dead in the woods and I’m going to hunt it out and bury it.”  

It was the third deer in as many weeks that had turned up dead near Beveridge’s home on the picturesque island about 70 miles northwest of downtown Seattle, known for its whale-watching and sailboating. 

Among neighbors, Beveridge is far from alone. Since early May, residents of the San Juan Islands reported dozens of strange deer deaths to state and local officials. 

“We just started getting calls of numerous deer dying for no apparent reason, with foam coming out of their mouth,” said San Juan County Sheriff Ron Krebs.

At first, county officials suspected fertilizers and pesticides, warning residents in a news release to “use care and apply chemicals as directed.” 


But after state officials sent tissue samples to a Washington State University laboratory for testing, the real culprit emerged — a fast-spreading virus in deer that operates not unlike COVID-19 does in humans. 

A Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife veterinarian said the disease, called adenovirus hemorrhagic disease, poses no risk to humans, but also that the infection could soon spread to the mainland and carve out a permanent home in the state. 

Virus’s origin still a mystery
First discovered in California in 1993, the disease had been seen in Washington just once before this year. In 2017, about a dozen animals fell ill near Goldendale in Klickitat County.  

Last fall, the virus unexpectedly emerged up north. 

“We were surprised as anyone else when it showed up in the Gulf Islands of British Columbia. It was a long distance from the last known outbreaks,” said Dr. Kristin Mansfield, a state wildlife veterinarian. 

Mansfield said the virus is “very contagious,” spread by direct contact between deer and through the air. Like COVID-19 in humans, research suggests healthy-appearing deer can shed and spread the virus.  

In deer that get sick, the virus “causes the blood vessels to become very leaky,” Mansfield said. Their lungs can fill with fluid or intestines hemorrhage. There is no treatment or cure.  


Common signs of infection include bloody diarrhea or frothing at the mouth.

“It’s a horrible way to die for these poor deer,” Mansfield said. 

She said it’s likely the San Juan Islands became the outbreak’s epicenter in Washington because of a deer swimming from island to island.

Just a few miles separate the San Juan Islands and the Gulf Islands off Vancouver Island.   

Mansfield said fecal transmission could be possible also, meaning the virus could have been tracked from place to place by deer poop on tires or boots. It’s also possible scavengers feeding on carcasses or parasitic insects could be spreading the virus across the islands. 

The Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab confirmed two cases in San Juan County using PCR molecular testing — the technology used to confirm cases of the coronavirus — and genomic sequencing.


San Juan County residents have submitted more than 50 reports of afflicted deer to state wildlife officials. Although the cause remains unconfirmed, most are likely the virus, Mansfield said. No evidence suggests the virus has jumped to other parts of Washington state — yet.  

“So far, we haven’t received suspicious reports from the mainland, though I would not be at all surprised if we do,” Mansfield said.

Islands particularly susceptible
The San Juan Islands — where deer are plentiful and have few, if any, natural predators — could be particularly susceptible to this kind of contagion.


“Deer up here are like people’s pets,” Krebs said, adding that residents feed them despite his office’s warnings against such practices.

In some areas, the creatures are shaping the landscape. Beveridge said her property is dotted with oxeye daisies simply because deer leave those plants alone and chew through everything else. 

Avoid feeding deer, Mansfield said. It might draw the animals together and spread the virus. They could use some social distance right now.  

Mansfield said residents who find a dead deer should report it to state wildlife officials using the agency’s online disease reporting system, then either leave the corpse alone, pull it into the woods to decompose, or better yet, bury it. Wear gloves when handling dead animals, Mansfield advises.

Given the experience of other states that have dealt with this disease, Mansfield does not expect the outbreak to significantly alter deer populations.  The virus often preys on fawns, and many are unlikely to survive their first year of life regardless of whether they catch the disease.  

Still, Mansfield said Washingtonians can expect to see more of this disease in deer.   

“Now that we have it diagnosed in two areas of Washington, we’re probably going to see it crop up here and there,” Mansfield said.",t2_emg1m,knightsofmars,0,1623553239.0,0,t1_h1kzchn,h1kzchn,False,SharpBeat,t3_nyds43,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanjuanislands/comments/nyds43/virus_to_blame_for_deer_foaming_at_the_mouth/,"Virus to blame for deer foaming at the mouth, dropping dead in the San Juan Islands",/r/sanjuanislands/comments/nyds43/virus_to_blame_for_deer_foaming_at_the_mouth/h1kzchn/,4,r/sanjuanislands,0,4

Really cool history tere as well. 

&#x200B;

Orcas Island: Rosario has a great Grill right in the harbor as well as a really cool old mansion and history that goes along with it.

Recommend the Crows Nest for a quick nosh downtown,and mayhap a beverage & food at Herbs Tavern. Jackson Beach experiencing some renovation, However still a lovely stroll.

"Yeah I totally agree, have to look at both sides. I lived many places growing up from east coast to west coast, Texas, and Hawaii. I also got drunk for the first time at 13, and was offered drugs from 11 onward of every variety, from weed and cocaine, to meth and heroin. I spent 5 years growing up in California (I moved there from Texas, and we moved to Reno where I graduated and there was no rampant hard drug problem). The graduating class from my school in California was roughly 100 people and 4 are dead from drug overdoses, 1 from suicide, and 1 was murdered (also drug related). I feel like this is a small town thing and there's not a lot that can be done about it besides live in a bigger town. 

I only really started looking at SJI when I saw the greatschools rating. It is SO much better than my local school, it's over 7/10 while the school we're zoned for is a 3/10 (worst scores are test scores and academic progress). So I'm sending her to private school but the cheapest good school I could find is 12k per year, the rest are over 20k per year and are more if you finance the payments and we're not Christian. So I totally get looking at the school, however anything is an improvement over what I've got. I did every charter school lottery in a 30 mile radius, best position I got was 41 on the waitlist. It sucks!

"Hi! First, a disclosure: I lived on Orcas and moved off-island close to two years ago, so COVID may have changed things. Make sure to be respectful of the locals - living in an area that depends on tourist traffic is always a bit weird, and I'm sure COVID has only made it stranger.

I would strongly recommend hopping on the interisland ferry to make the most of your time on the islands. Each one is a bit different in activities offered and general atmosphere. Depending on your budget, you can also charter boats to take you to smaller islands

Orcas: Best hiking. Less restaurants than San Juan, but there are some good ones. June is the beginning of peak tourist season and Orcas will definitely be less crowded than San Juan. Some recommendations:

* Turtleback mountain is a preserve owned by the San Juan Preservation Trust  [Turtleback Mountain Preserve | San Juan Preservation Trust (sjpt.org)](https://sjpt.org/visit-our-preserves/turtleback-mountain-conservation-easement/). Nice easy (gravel path with some elevation gain) hike to the top of turtleback, excellent views of the western San Juans, Vancouver Island, and a beautiful spot to watch the sunset. Also houses some of the most extensive Garry Oak meadows (an endangered ecosystem in the PNW) in the area. 
* Moran State Park: Moran is the largest park in the county. Remnants of old growth forests, lakes large & small, incredible views - Moran has it all. You can drive all the way to the watchtower at the top of Mount Constitution for epic views of the cascades, Mount Baker, Bellingham, and even Vancouver if it's sunny. Lots of interesting geology and plants as well. If you like a hike, I'd strongly recommend parking at Mountain Lake (a beautiful lake on its own) and hiking to the top. You can make it a loop by hiking north along the lake to twin lakes, heading up to the watchtower on top, and coming straight back down to Mountain Lake. It's more intense than turtleback - 1500-2000 ft over several miles to the top, and minimum of 3 hours round-trip. If you don't have time/energy, still drive to the top for the views!
* Doe Bay resort: famous clothing-optional hot tubs, good cocktails and food. Does bay is a long drive from the ferry (45 min) but close to Moran and great place to stop after a hike.
* If it's running, the [Sucia island ferry](https://outerislandx.com/sucia-island-ferry-and-water-taxi-service) run by Outer Island is a great way to get to a smaller island that is otherwise accessible only to boaters and kayakers.  Lots of beautiful views, interesting ecology, archaeology and even palaeontology. There are fossils on Sucia - including the only dinosaur fossil ever found in Washington!
* Island Hopping Brewing is a small brewery but usually has good beer, and has a great small-town feel to it, especially on a summer evening.
* The Barnacle has excellent cocktails but is tiny and might be hard to get seating at
* 100% have to check out Orcas Island Pottery. Beautiful property, beautiful pottery (WAY better than some kitschy souvenir from a tourist shop) and on a lovely part of the island.

San Juan is by far the busiest of the islands. Where on the island are you staying? Highlights include:

* South Beach/Cattle point. Absolutely gorgeous views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, miles of open beach, beautiful expanses of driftwood.  South Beach is one of my favorite spots on the islands for a beach fire on a summer evening - they have a bunch of fire pits at the beach area, and if you're lucky a fox may even run up and steal your hot dog! Foxes were introduced in the early 20th century and they're now all over the place around South Beach.
* Lime Kiln. The busiest park on the islands, but for a good reason. Beautiful views of Vancouver Island to west, potential whales, some interesting history, gorgeous old-growth madrona trees, and great tidepooling if the tide is low. Can make a nice hike out of it but it's mostly contained in a relatively small area around the parking lot.
* San Juan Island distilling - if you're in to that sort of thing, San Juan Island distilling has some incredible liquors with lots of locally-sourced ingredients. Look over their list and if you like what you see, definitely take a trip out there. Not sure about their hours these days but they've been very welcoming in the past, including accommodating individual tastings outside their normal hours.
* San Juan Brewery - right in Friday Harbor. Great beer. Feels a little more like a big-city brewery - large, lots of live-edge wood tables, etc.. Loses the atmosphere battle to Island Hoppin' on Orcas but the food and beer are better.

Lopez: The chillest of the islands. Least-trafficked of the big islands as well, unless you count Shaw (which you shouldn't, there's nothing to do there and that's how they like it!) .

* Ursa minor is the best restaurant on Lopez and maybe on the islands. Highly recommended
* Iceberg point has incredible views to the south and east, along with really cool geology, nice walks and a variety of rare plants.
* Odlin and Spencer spit are both great state parks for an afternoon exploration.
* Can you tell I'm running out of typing energy? Lopez is great too but I need to wrap this ting up asap

General

* I'd strongly encourage you to take a kayak tour while you're there. There are many options for guided kayak tours on San Juan and Orcas. It's the best way to really get a feel for the land and sea. If you're on Orcas for a day, Outer Island also offers a guided tour to my personal favorite hidden gem of the big 3 islands - Point Doughty on the northern tip of Orcas, which is only accessible by kayak. Bonus if you get there at low tide - as far as I know it's the only place in the state where you can see real live coral without SCUBA. 
* Whale watching is great as well but beware that your mileage may vary greatly depending on day/time. There are also some ethical concerns about the impacts of whale watching on whales, so make sure you vet your tour company and go with someone who really values stewardship of the natural world.
* If you have the extra cash, a trip to one of the smaller, less-traveled islands via a charter can really up the real wild-islands experience, but they aren't cheap. something like a sailboat charter to yellow island (a wildflower preserve owned by the Nature Conservancy), a trip to Jones Island State Park, or a day on Cypress are all experience that 99.99% of people who visit the islands don't get, because you need to (a) be a skilled open-water kayaker; (b) own your own boat; or (c) find a charter. Don't feel like you're missing out if you don't do this, but if you enjoy your time on the islands enough I can strongly recommend it for a second trip!

"We took the Puget Sound Express out of Port Townsend over Labor Day and it was glorious, we saw a family of Transient Orcas, and it was great! They have a few locations if you google them. 

Also, I understand that all the whale watching companies share their knowledge, so regardless of where you go they should know where whales are. You can go to the Orca Network on Facebook to see posts about all the recent sightings in the Salish Sea.

Going further North to depart on the tour will save you time in how long it takes to get to the orcas - basically, if you go from Edmonds the tour may have to spend more time getting to the orcas than if you left from say, Friday Harbor since it's much closer to their normal stomping grounds.

"I did a five-day cycling trip across the islands when I was a teen, it was planned and guided by adults (or so they seemed to me at the time!). I do remember being exhausted on the hills coming out of the ferry terminals but seeing as we were completely un-cycle-fit teens it can't have been that bad. I remember mostly staying at privately run biker/hiker only campsites with composting outhouses. I've done a little googling and it seems like the prebooked state campsites usually have hiker/biker sections that are available on the day. Maybe you could call the campsites/rangers or lake resorts and you might find someone chatty with lots of knowledge who could help you out?

As an adult I haven't camped on the islands yet, mostly stayed with my family in vacation homes, but I wouldn't hesitate to bike across the islands again.

(And, after you park, you can walk down to the water to the left/east of the waiting lines while you wait. There‘s boardwalks down there and good views.)

I’d recommend going to Lopez (the closest to Anacortes and so the shortest ferry ride) or to Orcas (about 20 minutes longer than the Lopez run, depending on the ferry). Going to Friday Harbor will eat up your day. 

Orcas will have more flexible times that Lopez for your return.

"Again, very appreciative for your insight as well as the other comments.

I'd just like to say that everything is relative. As an example, google tells me the Eastsound Chevron is currently at $4.14 per gallon. Just looked and my Chevron in Tahoe is at $4.50. Regarding tradespeople, my local contractor (who I've spent well over six figures with) was quoting me a 16 month lead time. Getting a plumber to come out on short notice (pre-covid) was $500 just for them to drive over on a weekend. Google Maps says it's normally 3:30h from Tahoe to SF, however that is actually an 8h trip on a Sunday.

"The only way to get a priority on the ferry, that I know of is a medical priority.  If you have a real medical issue in need of attention they will get you off the island.

It is expensive to live here.  Gas is about $1 more a gallon.  The ferry adds up if you go off island often.  You can buy a 5 ride at a considerable discout.  

Construction materials are outrageously overpriced.  A stud grade 2x4 is 2.50 at Lowes or HD, $5 here.

Quality, journeyman trades people are in very high demand so can be tough to get a plumber.

Education is highly valued, so public schools are good.  We are not a very diverse population.  I'm guessing Tahoe is like that too though.

It takes about 3.5 hours to get to Seattle.  If I'm on the 8am boat, traffic pending, usually in Seattle around 11:30am.  So you can do it in a day if needed.

"The ferries are really first come, first on. If you have a reservation, you go into the reservation line, meaning you get on before non reservation holders, but even then that is not always a steadfast rule. I have almost been bumped off a ferry even with a reservation due to crappy loading of a ferry. I was one car of the back of the ferry.

The best times to get onto a ferry are the very early morning boats or the last ones of the evening, but with delays that can make for long delays. Even during the past few (slower) months, the ferries are always behind schedule, from 5-90 mins for whatever reason. 

1. Lots of traffic
2. Rough seas
3. Not enough coast guard certified crew
4. Delays at destination or departure port
5. Any day that ends in y

As far as costs go, things are a bit more expensive when there are no alternatives. Think of items such as gas and groceries, other items you can always source from other places such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart, Target and utilize their low cost or free shipping. Keep in mind there is no next day delivery from Amazon here, actually often it ends up being 3 day delivery. 

My biggest gripe (not really a big one) is that on SJI, both of the bakeries are closed on the weekends, that is when I want fresh bread / pastries, but I certainly understand that not everyone wants to work on a weekend.

"I've only been to Tahoe once and basically just drove through it so can't really compare.  We don't really have forrest roads, there are only a few places to camp, so I don't think tourists driving onto property that big an issue.  I do know of one family that had an issue but they live on a bluff on the Westside of the island so it was people looking for a view to see orcas.  They put in a gate.

I have 5 acres, never had a tourist drive onto my property.  It is fully fenced however.

The Land Bank offers plenty of hiking in designated areas.

I don't think those are big concerns.

The bigger concerns usually are more about cost of living, access to medical care, dealing with the ferry in summer, etc.  You need to have a reservation for the ferry and in the summer getting one can be challenging.

If you end up moving here, which we did about 8 years ago, I strongly recommend getting medical airlift insurance.",t2_5x2i5j07,quacktasticy,0,1615581991.0,0,t1_gqqbhaz,gqqbhaz,False,Retumbo77,t3_m3ocye,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanjuanislands/comments/m3ocye/tourist_traffic_on_the_islands/,Tourist Traffic on the Islands,/r/sanjuanislands/comments/m3ocye/tourist_traffic_on_the_islands/gqqbhaz/,2,r/sanjuanislands,0,2

"My opinion, for whatever it's worth, is that Guemes isn't worth it. You've got the inconvenience of the ferry but without the charm and beauty of Orcas, San Juan, Shaw and Lopez. The only plus there is I think there's less tourism. There are some nice spots but also a surprising amount of development for what you'd expect to be a remote island. I've been over there a handful of times and always left fairly quickly. That said, to each their own. 

You mentioned being able to hop on a bike and be on the mainland in a timely manner which I definitely get, but think about this. WSF has 3-5 boats up in the islands at any one time so while the trip to Anacortes is longer, they've got backup if there happens to be a breakdown. Guemes just has the one boat as far as I know. I think they've got a contract for a small passenger boat for emergencies but not being able to bring your vehicle on to go shopping or get medical care could be an issue. One thing to think about too is if you're on a bike out in the islands you'll always make the boat (unlike in a car), you'd be first on and first off and bikes are free on the interisland vessel so going from island to island would be easy for you.

"There's a lot of hillside property on Orcas that will yield good views and plenty of space for running around.  OPALCO (the local power company) within the last couple years added high speed community internet to their services, and is headquartered on Orcas so I'd imagine you can get broadband easily there.

For the price, style, and size you're looking for, I think your best bet is a prefab wood frame home or [A-frame](https://everywhereco.com/ayfraym-new/); these were popular on the islands when I was a kid precisely because they were cheap, easy to assemble, and attractive homes.  Of course, for the *real* '70s island experience you should get [one of these](http://www.domehome.com/) :)

As others have mentioned, GC cost and timeliness is worse in the islands because A) demand is high, B) bringing stuff over on the ferries drives up costs and times, and C) they know they've got people over a barrel.  Pre-fabs help take a lot of that stuff out of the equation.
