"An 8-year-old girl was airlifted to a hospital Sunday night after she fell 18 feet from her second-story bedroom window in Sebastopol, officials said.

First responders arrived at the home near Meadowlark Drive and Scott Road around 5:30 p.m., said Sebastopol Fire Chief Bill Braga.

The girl had fallen from the window after the screen popped out, according to Braga.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know exactly why she fell,‚Äù Braga said.

He said first responders suspected the girl had a broken femur.

She was in stable condition Sunday night when officials took her in an ambulance to the Sebastopol Community Cultural Center. She was then transferred to a helicopter that landed in a nearby field.

Because she‚Äôs a juvenile, the girl was treated as a trauma patient and airlifted to the Oakland Children‚Äôs Hospital to check for internal injuries, Braga said.",t2_uyv4,phusion,0,1638234330.0,0,t1_hmlrd26,hmlrd26,True,phusion,t3_r5ap2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/sebastopol/comments/r5ap2o/8yearold_girl_airlifted_to_hospital_after_falling/,8-year-old girl airlifted to hospital after falling from second-story window in Sebastopol,/r/sebastopol/comments/r5ap2o/8yearold_girl_airlifted_to_hospital_after_falling/hmlrd26/,5,r/sebastopol,0,5

"I‚Äôm going to be blunt.  I‚Äôve lived here my entire life, and it‚Äôs not even Sebastopol anymore.  I don‚Äôt recognize this town anymore, but that‚Äôs me.  This is about you.  

Those reasons you have are great for picking a place to visit and tour, but there is more to living here.  I suspect you know all this. 

There is crime.  Meth is a problem, pot being used where the smoke invades your space is a problem too.  
Catalytic converter theft has been popular. 

Home ownership is a joke with no punchline for most people.  Rent is a joke too.  $3000 for 962 sq ft, two small bedrooms, no insulation and built in the 60‚Äôs.  PGE is hard on the pocketbook.  

Traffic!   WFH is a stroke of luck for both of us.  Traffic is terrible nearly all the time.  Don‚Äôt leave around school open and closing.  Remember, there aren‚Äôt many ways out of town. 

Speaking of that.  When the town was evacuated, it took my neighbors eight hours to exit town.  The cars and pathways out of town were so contested with people doing the same thing, and they only had to go two miles.   

Consumerism is the driving force behind the town. The city council wants people to spend money here.  The taxes are high, and the city does little to make the town easier to live in.  It‚Äôs hard to find a doctor here.  The city has made it too expensive for private practice, but the health groups seem to have the funds to stay.  

There are a lot of tourists, and they drive and walk like the town was made for their personal use.  

There is a lot of money though, and as a personal chef, I bet you‚Äôll do well in that vein.  

I know that‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúcon‚Äôs‚Äù, for the town.  I‚Äôm third generation, and I have a lot of opinions.  If the earlier part is to much of a downer, then leave with the idea that moving to a town like Sebastopol is like a personal relationship.  You have to give back as much as you take. The town will give you those things you want now, but if you want more as you age, then the town may not be the right fit anymore.

"My wife and I split our time between Sebastopol and Oakland. We absolutely love it up here. We keep finding ways to spend more of our time in Sebastopol. You will be making sacrifices, to be sure. There are limited nightlife options, great restaurants, but fewer of them, etc. As former long-time SF residents ourselves, I can tell you there‚Äôs very little we miss not living there. And SF is still only an hour away, for any particular cravings you might have. 

It‚Äôs very much a small town, but it‚Äôs vibrant and lively. The neighborhood you‚Äôre looking at is a little outside of downtown, but there are many great things within walking distance still.

I can‚Äôt speak to the difficulty of meeting new people as we‚Äôre pretty well established with our friend circles, but everyone we have met here has been very friendly. We know all of our neighbors, and are friendly with folks in lots of the businesses we frequent.

So yeah, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything to worry about. I would suggest spending some time up here before you move, of course. Rent an AirBnB for a weekend or two, come up, hang out.

"Hey there!

As someone else in my early 30s living here, I can tell you it‚Äôs heaven. The area you‚Äôre looking at is where my girlfriend and I live.

"There's minimal risk when you're in an open air environment and passing people momentarily. The CDC Guidelines account for this:
>CDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. ...
People who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a mask if it causes difficulty breathing. If unable to wear a mask, consider conducting the activity in a location with greater ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors) and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.  
   
Rest assured that she passed dozens of other people not wearing masks and probably did that to all of them. You can't go onto a multiuse trail and reasonably expect everyone to be wearing a mask. But she wont be the last one you'll come across. So if you dont feel like dealing with it I'd suggest a neck gaiter, as you can quickly pull it up while riding and put it down again.  
  
As for her choice of mask, if she actually tried to pull that shit in my store I'd make her leave. I wish the state were more strict on what constitutes a proper mask. The most common form of protest is the dick-nosers, who like to pretend that nostril air comes from a different set of lungs or something. I tell them to cover their nose. But this latest trend of ultra-fine masks is harder to enforce. Our own guidelines specify two layers of densely woven fabric but the CDC guidelines say fuck all about it. So I've seen people separating the back layer off surgical masks to make these semi-transparent masks that are about as effective as screen doors.

"If you're passing people in Ragle, you should wear a mask.  I take mine off when there's nobody around, but I regularly get passed by mountain bikers and runners who don't bother wearing one ""because exercise breathing"", and it sucks because as you say they are breathing heavily and potentially releasing a lot of covid in their breath.

The 6ft rule has been mostly debunked. Covid can travel quite far, even outside if not wearing a mask. My mask pretty much only protects you from me, so when someone disregards my safety in that way I get very annoyed. With nearly 200,000 covid deaths and \~5 million infections in the USA alone, this is something everybody should be taking extremely seriously. It's life or death.

Ragle seems to be rife with anti-maskers. I pass at least a few groups of them every time on my regular walks around the blackberry loop. It sounds like the lady you interacted with was unreasonable.

At its meeting on July 16, the Sebastopol City Council voted to switch the city‚Äôs utility accounts over to Evergreen, a 100% local and renewable energy program from Sonoma Clean Power. The switch will cost the city an additional $41,500 a year.

‚ÄúThis is the single most important thing we can do that will have the largest effect on our greenhouse gas emissions,‚Äù said Council¬≠member and Sonoma Clean Power Board Member Patrick Slayter.

The council rejected Councilmember Michael Carnacchi‚Äôs suggestion that they examine other options, such as PG&E‚Äôs renewable energy programs, instead arguing for the advantages of local energy sourcing and local control that Sonoma Clean Power provides.

Mayor Neysa Hinton initially suggested that the council start out by switching 50% of the city‚Äôs utility accounts to the Evergreen program, but in the end she went along with the majority and voted to go whole hog.

Carnacchi, who expressed his support for some kind of 100% renewable option, abstained.

The council also voted to strike a blow for zero waste by voting to go paperless, moving from paper documentation to electronic. They approved a resolution to provide councilmembers with city-owned iPads to be used exclusively for city business or, alternatively, give councilmembers a $600 stipend to buy their own tablet, which could be used for both city and personal business. Councilmembers could still request paper versions if they wanted. The council said financially this would be a wash ‚Äî the money the city saves in paper costs would pay for the cost of tablets.

At the beginning of the evening, councilmembers accepted a giant check for $1.5 million from District 10 Assemblymember Marc Levine to pay for damage caused by the February flooding.

‚ÄúAll of the sudden we have a little more money,‚Äù said Councilmember Una Glass, noting that now the city could shift some of the money originally slated for flood repair to other programs, including perhaps a city grant writer or a green energy incentive program for citizens. The council agreed to re-examine the budget in light of these changes at its mid-year review.",t2_36k8k,gotnate,0,1563545939.0,0,t1_eu7ynee,eu7ynee,True,phusion,t3_cezaf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sebastopol/comments/cezaf7/sebastopol_city_council_goes_greener/,Sebastopol City Council goes greener,/r/sebastopol/comments/cezaf7/sebastopol_city_council_goes_greener/eu7ynee/,2,r/sebastopol,0,2

"Welcome to Sebastopol!! I haven't visited any of the galleries in town, though there is a small one on Healdsburg Ave down the hill from Florence that I love to look through the windows of. I'd wager if you talk to one gallery owner they could lead you to other options as well. 

In Guerneville they have first Friday art walks, so maybe check the galleries there for ideas too. There's also regularly coordinated art events, where artists open up their home studios for a weekend for people to visit as well, but I can't recall the name of that. My last idea is the Free Art Friday movement that's based out of Santa Rosa but includes the entire county, it's organized through Instagram. The guy who organizes it has the username zr_art, perhaps him or the other artists might have suggestions. 

Wait, one more! You might approach some of the local coffee shops about displaying your art. Brew in Santa Rosa does this and Hardcore Coffee in Sebastopol as well, can't speak for others.

"I live at my grandma's house in this neighborhood. While I haven't attended our community's meetings with this organization, the main arguments I've heard against it was that: A) The veterans would do better and be more successful in a more nature oriented area (which might be true, but it seems to me that the point is to reintroduce them to society) B) The house they're moving into/renovating is too small for the number of people they're going to try to cram into it C) the organization is/has been going about this in a very sketchy way - they waited until they had already bought the property to tell the community what they were doing, and D) The company seems pretty sketch. They have some 20-30 lawyers, mostly big-name guys, they work in close association with. At the first meeting, the two volunteer hosts seemed somewhat uninformed and struggled to answer the difficult question. There was a man in a suit sitting at the back of the meeting that didn't say anything. That being said I support the mission of the organization, but I think it's really sketch that they didn't inform the community first. Whether or not the community is justified in their opinion, I believe that as the organization, it's important to let the community know your plans in advance and hopefully find a community that supports you instead of forcing your way into one that doesn't want you. Either way, I'd be interested to follow the money going into and out of this organization to see how legitimate they are.

"After the big quake in SF in 1989, a psychologist was on TV (there was still TV back then) and said you should yell at the ground and say ""Stop shaking"" over and over until it stops* - I swear to god this is true and was not a comedy segment.        
   
_* Obviously, only if you are safe.        
    
Also, don't go to doorways, the new advice is to roll off your bed and lay next it - this is due to the fact that most earth quake survivors are found next to large/heavy furniture that protects them from falling structural elements.  It is recommended to keep your shoes and a few other supplies near the head of your bed. For reasons you need your shoes next to you head over to the napa subreddit and see how almost every report includes broken glass/dishes/vases/etc.

"1) go to Screamin' Mimi's for ice cream. There's really no question, Mimi's is the best. I recommend deep dark secret, Mimi's mud, and galaxy, but their specials are always good to try also. And, you know, everything else they offer.

2) For Mexican food, Martha's is the best. However, if you want just a really good burrito to go, stop by Ochoa's. Their burritos are delicious, and very big.

3) follow traffic laws. The cops are fairly bored and most of what they do is enforce minor things. They like to hide out in side streets and parking lots where they are technically still visible (so it's not really a speed trap), but where you're unlikely to notice them.

4) Mary's pizza is good. And the meatballs are delicious.

5) if you're here while it happens, stop by the Gravenstein apple festival and get some apple fritters. You'll know them when you try them.

6) in July, the Enmanji Buddhist temple has a Teriyaki dinner. There's some really good traditional Japanese food to be had. 

7) buy some strawberries during the summer from the stand on highway 12. They're good well into the fall, actually.

8) Fircrest Market is a great place to buy groceries. Local, friendly, and fairly priced.

9) I actually haven't been into the Barlow yet, but I've heard good things so it's worth checking out.

10) pop over to the Russian River Brewing Company in Santa Rosa and order a Pliny the Elder.

Hope that helps, enjoy your stay!

"A little bit about Sebastopol: It's one of the more hippy-esque towns in Sonoma County and you will find a fair amount of dreadlocks and grungy folk walking the streets. Many nice shops on main street, including a music store, copperfield's books, a few pricey restaurants, and some pricey gift shops with all kinds of hippy and organic trinkets. Lots of terrible drivers and many ecentric people around the bars on the weekends. A strange mix of hicks and hippies, but we all seem to mesh together just fine. The main downtown plaza has some fun stuff going on regularly (farmer's market on the weekend, and some local bands playing every once in awhile). Some good places to eat: King Falafel (greek, Mediterranean food), Martha's (Mexican food), Main Street Deli, Screamin' Mimi's (Killer ice cream). For hiking and outdoor activities you can go to Ragle Park or Ives Park. Also, a 20 minute drive to the russian river and the redwoods, if you're into that kind of stuff. Out of all the towns/cities that I have lived in this area, I would say Sebastopol is my favorite. Only been around here for 3 years, but it felt like home a long time ago. Whether you are a snobby uptight tofu eating patchouli wearing rich person, or just a drifter meandering through town, you'll find your place in this little town.

"Also, avoid driving anywhere within city limits after midnight. The streets are dead so they get bored and will pull anyone over. Even if you're doing nothing wrong, they will make up an excuse. 

About a year ago, I was driving through town at 1am. 100% obeying traffic laws, including speed limit. I see a policeman parked on the side of the road, and as soon as I pass him he swings out and pulls me over. First thing he says is ""have you been drinking?"". I had not, and told him so (and no, I wasn't swerving or anything to make him think so). He then asks me where I'm going and all that stalling, trying to catch me slip or something. Finally after he's satisfied, he tells me, ""I pulled you over because your license plate light is out, get that fixed and keep out of trouble"".

"The wineries are already in the area, they are just in the countryside. Also you seem to not understand how the wine industry works, just because there are more wineries in the town doesn't mean that more orchards will be cut down, these wineries buy grapes from all over sonoma country, not just in our area. Also these are not major wineries, they are boutique small wineries. 

um Sebastopol and gentrification? Have you been there lately ahah its the most gentrified town ever. Tons of white rich hippies. However, I do agree that it will probably increase the image of a gentrified Sebastopol even more so. 

The Farmers Market has been looking to move from the square for years, it is too small of a space for the vendors. In fact the market has to turn down vendors because they dont have room for them, this move will benefit both the market and the vendors. I don't see what your issue with this is? 

And while traffic is an issue, having a thriving economy is more important. I want Sebastopol to be able to continue to be a prosperous and nice place to live and without an influx of capital from tourism and industry that isn't a sure thing. You might say that Sebastopol is good the way it is now, but that is surely not the case, a lot of local businesses are not doing so hot. Anything that will bring more tourists and money into the town will surely help out the local businesses and the community as a whole. 

Not to mention that this is a celebration of what West County is. A place where you can get fresh, local, handmade artisan crafts and food.   So while you might think of this as gentrification I will take the opposite opinion and say that this is a project that is striving to create a place where Sebastopol can show off who we are, and what we stand for. 

Frankly, the only valid argument I see in your comment is the issue of traffic, which I could see becoming an even bigger issue in the area. I mean 12 during rush hour is crazy, and its gonna be even crazier once this opens up.

Kinda smacks of gentrification to me...this thing is gonna move the farmer's market away from the town square? It's gonna bring major wineries into the small town? We've already lost most of the apple orchards to vineyards...I don't see a need to draw more traffic to Sebastopol.,t2_6v5wd,1001comments,0,1334562263.0,0,t1_c4cth4z,c4cth4z,True,pfitchlet,t3_s42zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/sebastopol/comments/s42zr/the_barlow_project_thoughts/,"The Barlow Project, thoughts?",/r/sebastopol/comments/s42zr/the_barlow_project_thoughts/c4cth4z/,1,r/sebastopol,0,1
