"Live off of Beach and Atlanta one block from the beach, 3 bedroom condo. My parents wanted to live in our community as they are getting old. One unit just came on the market and listed for 850,000$ , we offered 885,000 cash , 20 day escrow , and no contingencies. It went for over 900,000.  Market is insane. With rates going up I think by the end of the year prices will drop dramatically , just my thoughts, not a professional. These prices are insane and I never thought my little 1300 sq ft condo would be worth close to a million.  This is the norm right now.. everything is selling in 2-3 days for well above asking. Maybe it wont drop , but interest rates go to 6% how would anyone trying to get in the market be able to afford it.... supposedly rates are going up every 3 months for the next couple of years.

"Long Beach High School Teacher here. I live in Huntington Beach though. HB schools are quite good and most admin is impressive. As in they tend to have both a high academic IQ AND emotional IQ. My daughter is in the HB school system. I’ve taken a few shots at moving into the HB system and it is extremely competitive. I’ve taught high school consistently for 16 years, have received a couple teacher of the year awards, school spirit award, coached several sports, conducted Mock Trial and Junior Statesmen clubs etc. Even with all that I usually only can get into the final interviews. I don’t say this to discourage you, just to give you an idea of the level of competition in HB. Being from NYC I know you are probably already used to high competition though lol. I would say if you are serious about HB make sure to do the following: research the schools and get familiar with their site specific data, email staff at the site and get familiar with their takes on the school, it’s culture, and the goals for the site. Also, I know cost of living in NYC is pretty nuts, but HB isn’t much better. The rent, on average, is in the $3,000 range for a standard apartment. Absolutely take a shot at HB, but, prep some plans to live near HB at first and work in a neighboring district. While you do that volunteer to help coach in HB and get the people around here to learn who you are and soon enough you will be in HB.

I don't buy the ""it's because of high traffic"" argument. Long Beach is also high traffic and doesn't have nearly as many problems.

"We don’t run into too many non HUD approved condos, but it’s pretty easy to find out once you’ve located a property you’re interested in. With that said, if it’s possible to put an extra 1.5% down and just go conventional (some people don’t realize you can put 5% down and avoid going FHA), that would be the way to go. Would say you a lot of money going that route. 


Regarding the condo/townhome market, yes it’s been the same craziness as SFR properties unfortunately. Also, because sellers have multiple offers, it’s been a little more difficult for my clients who are putting less than 20% down to get their offers accepted.

">The gentrification is real, and the city council consistently makes horrible decisions around new residential planning so we have increasingly bad traffic and inadequate public transportation.

Pretty sure I haven't seen any bad new housing decisions except stupid rejections such as the car wash at Beach & Ellis.  The Beach Edinger Corridor SP was a good plan that they unwisely cut the cap on resulting in a lawsuit that we lost.  And now the recall proponents want to try to waste tax dollars on another ill-advised lawsuit.  

The state has dictated that we have to find a place for 13,000+ units--which the state has the right to do, despite all the rhetoric from the noisy NIMBYs.  Most of those units won't get built.  Even if the city zones sites for housing, existing owners won't have to sell and some existing uses are worth more as they are than they would be as land for residential development.  

We'll undoubtedly see a few thousand units built over the next decade, but that doesn't even begin to make up for a near total lack of construction from 1990 to 2013.  

I figure those new apartments are bringing in people with six figure incomes (based on average rents over $3,000/month and three-times-the-rent income requirements) who are eating at local restaurants, spending money in local stores, and generally helping drive the local economy.  

Plus the buildings that have been built have added about $1 billion to the property tax base in the city, which is money the city can absolutely use.  

Traffic-wise, residential generates fewer trips than retail, so the ""apartments cause traffic"" buzzphrase is just people seeing what they want to see and ignoring facts.",t2_dm0fd,StateOfContusion,0,1647366482.0,0,t1_i0ryhn2,i0ryhn2,False,CA-ClosetApostate,t3_tehrt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/huntingtonbeach/comments/tehrt5/how_crazy_is_the_real_estate_market_as_of_now/,How crazy is the real estate market as of now?,/r/huntingtonbeach/comments/tehrt5/how_crazy_is_the_real_estate_market_as_of_now/i0ryhn2/,3,r/huntingtonbeach,0,3

"**[Glasgow Ice Cream Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Ice_Cream_Wars)** 
 
 >The Ice Cream Wars were turf wars in the East End of Glasgow, Scotland, in the 1980s between rival criminal organisations selling drugs and stolen goods from ice cream vans. Van operators were involved in frequent violence and intimidation tactics, the most notable example of which involved a driver and his family who were killed in an arson attack that resulted in a twenty-year court battle. The conflicts generated widespread public outrage, and earned the Strathclyde Police the nickname of ""Serious Chimes Squad"" (a pun on Serious Crime Squad) for its perceived failure to address them.

Now they can’t really go gather signatures by screaming “N_____! N_____! N_____!” So they went with high density housing as a red herring.  

The city has already lost a battle with the state about affordable housing and RHNA (Regional Housing Needs Assessment) because the state has the right to require cities to zone land for housing.  

These rocket scientists, because they can’t win on racism, instead are tapping into a deep anti-growth sentiment that a lot of (extraordinarily hypocritical) NIMBY/BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone) types harbor.  They’re saying that we can sue the state and win this time.  They’ve got as much credibility on that as the folks you see posted about in r/amibeingdetained.

">The majority voted for Ortiz.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is what is known as ""a lie.""    


>Lie: Noun.  a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth.  
something intended or serving to convey a false impression; imposture:  
*His flashy car was a lie that deceived no one.*  
an inaccurate or untrue statement; falsehood:  
*When I went to school, history books were full of lies, and I won't teach lies to kids.*

Tap Out Tito did not get a majority of the votes.  In fact, he ***wasn't even close*** *to a majority of the votes*.  He would have had to have more than tripled his vote count to get a majority of the votes.  

He received 14.83% of the votes, meaning that 85.17% of Huntington Beach's voters **did not** vote for CTE Ortiz.

I suspect they're not going to improve it. They are going to keep raising prices until residents can no longer afford it and are forced to move out.

&#x200B;

"> **After more than 50 years in Huntington Beach, Lucci’s is closing Feb. 26**
Anne Valdespino
February 15, 2022 at 9:41 a.m.

>Jacob Carter, a longtime employee at Lucci’s Italian American Deli, rolls out a cart of product for a customer in Huntington Beach on Monday, February 14, 2022. 

>Lucci’s will be closing on Feb. 26 after 50 years in Huntington Beach and 75 years in business. 

>Grab-and-go torpedo sandwiches to take to the beach. Trays of cold cuts for house parties.  An Italian bakery turning out cakes and cookies daily. A neighborhood restaurant where locals hang out with a grocery to shop for the best ingredients to make pizza, lasagna and spaghetti at home.

>Lucci’s Italian American Deli in Huntington Beach will close after more than 50 years, said owner Rick Refice, and its last day of service will be Feb. 26. The family business was started in Gardena in 1946 by his grandmother, Lena Lucci, as an Italian market with a meat department and deli.

>She sold that place in 1977, but the Huntington Beach location, which opened in 1971, was owned by Rick’s father, William Refice Sr. Rick Refice is Lucci’s present owner and he operated this location for decades, 30 years of that time with his brother William Refice, Jr. as his business partner.

>”Service, quality, friendship, family oriented.  We make all our employees feel like they’re part of the family, not some corporation,” he said of the secret to Lucci’s longevity. “Stores like ours don’t exist anymore.”

>Locals ate in the restaurant and shopped in the grocery section which stocked everything for the Italian home chef — the place was selling San Marzano tomatoes and caputo flour before they became trendy.

>Jars of olives, artichokes and other antipasti favorites were offered, along with wine and specialty items like semolina flour, amaretti cookies, Italian nougat and espresso powder. The refrigerator case was stuffed with house-made ravioli, gnocchi and sauces.

>The bakery made fresh bread, birthday cakes and other goodies. “Parents would come in, bring their kids and get a free cookie,” he said. Then when those kids became parents, they would bring their kids in for a free cookie and so on. “We have third generation customers,” Refice said.

>After it was announced late last week that Lucci’s would be closing, fans on Facebook’s HB Local page began singing the deli’s praises.

>”I also grew up in Gardena and loved getting sandwiches and treats there. I moved to HB 40 years ago and loved that Lucci’s was also here. I’m so going to miss this amazing deli, ” wrote Armida E. Gordon.

>“Before I was old enough to shop at Lucci’s, my mom did and before her, my grandmother,” said Jennifer Frost. “A big thanks to Lucci’s for always making family gatherings tasty!”

>”Fed my boys and all their friends buckets of spaghetti their entire childhoods,” said Rick Muckelrath.

>Lucci’s has been busy with regulars dropping by to get a last taste of the signature items before it closes. “Especially this morning. It was nuts all day, every day, since Thursday and Friday, it’s been like nonstop,” Refice said. “We had to shut down just for an hour to regroup.”

>The groceries are pretty much cleaned out, but the restaurant, deli and bakery will be open from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. daily until Feb. 26. Business has been good, even during the pandemic, Refice said. Customers who couldn’t find pasta at the grocery stores were raiding Lucci’s shelves. “When the pandemic first hit, I was going through a thousand pounds of pasta a day.”

>The reason for the closure is that Refice decided not to renew his lease. His son Taylor Refice plans to open a new Lucci’s with one of its employees, Jacob Carter, in a location within a few miles of the old one in about 7 or 8 months.

>Until then Refice invites regulars in for a last bite of Italian home style cooking. He’s announcing his appreciation for their business all these years, from the time his grandma opened in Gardena until he closes in Huntington Beach. “We have big sign out front,” he said. “Thank you for 75 years of loyalty!”",t2_8u4e8,elysians,0,1644995109.0,0,t1_hx585re,hx585re,True,elysians,t3_stpiiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/huntingtonbeach/comments/stpiiu/luccis_closure_updates_article_text_in_comments/,Lucci’s Closure Updates (article text in comments),/r/huntingtonbeach/comments/stpiiu/luccis_closure_updates_article_text_in_comments/hx585re/,10,r/huntingtonbeach,0,10

"It's more kid than 25 but less than 18. A lot of people have at least some college experience by 22 (you can have your bachelor's by that age) but still not like full independent reality. A lot of people are still relying on their parents at that age, even if it's just financially (living on your own but your parents help with bills.)

I'm not saying you're wrong. But from a parent's perspective their kid barely has any real world experience and is still learning to be on their feet. I had a job and degree by that age, paid my own bills, and was taking care of my cat while he was dying of cancer. That's a lot of responsibility. But still young and naive.

That said, it doesn't excuse doing stupid driving stunts or not even driving with the correct fucking license.

"Most of the negative comments about the recall are from people who are not long time residents , not home owners , don’t have families and don’t actively participate in the community or follow city council meetings. Huntington Beach is a great place to live and raise a family. Those being recalled were elected with special interest outside money and are making decisions against the will of the people. Crime is up because of the failed 5.  The HB City Council members being recalled LIED to the HB citizens and violated their promises to fight the state on High Density housing and protect our HB Charter. On April 19th, 2021 they voted 5-1 to table, indefinitely, suing the State over the unlawful forced mandate that we zone for 13k more residential units. By NOT suing the State, they weaken our City Charter and forfeit our Local Control over our Zoning Statutes to the State. This is compounded further when the Governor signed last week Senate Bill 9 and Senate Bill 10 which further removes Local Control over City's Zoning Statutes by destroying single family Zoning. SB 9 allows a developer to build a duplex on a single family lot or a 4-plex by dividing the single family lot into two parcels. SB 10 allows Cities and Counties to draft an ordinance to allow a 10 Unit Apartment building on a single family lot.
​
- They passed $372 MILLION in bonds to purchase two existing High Density projects (Elan at Beach and Ellis and Breakwater behind Olive Garden on Beach Blvd) for PUBLIC HOUSING using a loophole known as a Joint Powers Agreement! Bonds are legally required to go to a Vote of the Citizens. These Housing Projects deny the city over $500,000.00 per year in property tax revenue for 35 years!! (Amortized at 2% increase per year the loss to city after 35 years is $1,000,000.00 per year). This one deal DOUBLED THE CITY’S DEBT IN UNDER 1 YEAR with nothing positive to show for it.
​
- They created ""secret"" 3 member boards and subcommittees with no public input or transparency and UNILATERALLY appointed agenda-driven members like their appointment of Rhonda Bolton to City Council.
 
- They have committed $15 million to start up a Homeless Shelter that should have been funded by the County. Ongoing costs will be in excess of $1.5 million per year....which should ALSO be funded by the county....and STILL have not put so much as a dent in the homeless crisis in our city. - 
​
- They Voted to start a MASSIVE GOV'T expansion known as Community Choice Energy (CCE) that puts the city in the energy business under the guise of pushing ""green"" energy. Similar programs throughout the state are already failing and filing for bankruptcy. Riverside County's CCE filed for bankruptcy over the summer and dissolved. Everyone in H.B. will be automatically opted into the CCE program early next year and residents will then have to opt out if they want to remain with Southern California Edison.

"Well, I disagree.  The recall stuff started with the appointment to fill Ortiz's open seat.  A segment of HB wanted the council to go against the charter and install their preferred candidate to the seat based on the vote from the previous election.  That didn't happen, so they then immediately tried to recall the new council member.  Unfortunately for them, you can't do that.  So, they changed course and started the effort to recall the three council members they disagree with and landed on a mixed bag of ""issues"" to justify the recall.  

The housing stuff, while a reasonable issue to be concerned about, has nothing to do with recalling members of the city council.  The City sued the state about it and lost.  With that loss, the council chose to cut their losses rather than continue to waste time and money fighting the state about the proper limits of state authority over local zoning and permitting.  The city lost -- changing the council through a recall won't change that, other than a new council choosing to waste more time and resources fighting a lost cause.  If the residents of HB really want to light money on fire fighting that fight, there will be an election coming up where they can vote in council members who will do that.

"As a car enthusiast that lives downtown, I wouldn't live on PCH. The general road noise will likely get to you before the loud exhausts. I live 2 blocks in and I'll only hear the motorcycles at night when they're ripping by. Occasionally I'll hear a group of cars on a Sunday cruise but from where I'm at it's really not that bad. 

Now, speaking for myself as an enthusiast, I do like the sound of a tuned exhaust. Unfortunately the trend towards turbocharging and misguided young ones means a lot of exhaust now is just pops and bangs which does sound like shit. And of course they love doing it in the most populated areas. 

Ironically as modifying has become less and less prevalent, these guys stick out more and as a result seem to be driving momentum of the general public against the enthusiast community. This is unfortunate for the rest of us as we automatically get lumped in with those guys. Eventually cars will be silent, devoid of emotion and removing another little bit of individuality from those of us that enjoy such things. And that'll be a sad day. 

Also another thing to consider - loud pipes save lives. You'll likely hear these guys coming before you see them. They might be assholes, but they do announce their arrival. Definitely can't say the same for the *MUCH* faster electric cars sharing our roads now.

"Sad of course, but I know many people that are not vaccinated and they are my friends, neighbors and cousins. (I don't know if Ernby was vaccinated or not.)  

I am certainly no expert, and I can admit that.  But my friends, neighbors and cousins can't.  Suddenly, they are all experts in immunology, virology, history, ivermectin, freedom, the Spanish flu, etc.  And some of these people I am referring to, I have always thought of them as dumb people!

Meanwhile, many of the people that I have always thought were bright and clear thinking are vaccinated.  So I am just going to do what they do.

Geez, the other day, a construction worker I know tell me there will be a ""big discovery in 5 years when 30% of people who have been vaccinated will die.""   He knows this bc he knows a lawyer that has ""16 experts lined up"" who will testify.  I don't know how to talk to a person like that.

"Happy to give you an itemized breakout as a landscape estimator for a small design build contracting firm elsewhere in California. 

Poured in place concrete pavers: $26 a square foot, include the footage of the entire area, not the concrete itself as you have to do all those forms still. Regular concrete flat work with saw cut expansion joints, $24 a square foot. No color, broom or similar finish. 

CMU and stucco veneer wall: $50-60 a square foot for the veneer. Since it’s load bearing and holding the bench and what not, CMU wall is about $100-150 a lineal foot. 

Custom redwood(or ipe) bench: set brackets into cmu wall, shape to specified length. S4s wood if redwood. 
$2800 

Irrigation: easy $4000-$6000 fancy emitter drip system, possibly WiFi enabled irrigation controller. Stubs and laterals under concrete. 

Artificial turf: give ‘em the good stuff, SynLawns top of the line shit runs $5 a square foot for just the turf. Base, gopher wire, sand, header boards add in $10 a square foot. $2-3 a square foot for install on the turf. Oh yeah gotta factor in the whole coverage as well and cut out the squares on the pavers, no seams. Rolls only come in 15’ widths so hope you checked your math. 

Plantings: OP used lots of nice succulents in decent sizes. Easy gets $45 a 1 gallon plant, planted.

"In HB? in OC? Anywhere?

I cook pretty good steak myself. Butter, EVOO, diced garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, maybe a little paprika and/or cayenne pepper. Then saute onion, bell peppers, mushrooms, snow peas, carrots, green onion, lime juice, maybe some serranos and/or cilantro.

Fresh ingredients from my garden taste way better than bottled spices as well.

I generally cook all the veggies in a pan first, get em good and grilled so they aren't crispy anymore at the end add the garlic because it burns quick.

Then I do the steak in the same pan using the leftover flavors in the pan add a bit of garlic at the start on each side, and when its almost done add a bit more garlic so it doesn't burn off. And just throw all the veggies all over the steak so they get heated and the juices and flavors are all mixed up. If using serranos add those in last too, the fumes get pretty strong and you want to soften them up, but not too much.
