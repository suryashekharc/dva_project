"Taxes in Texas and EP are actually not that bad. I live in Charlotte Metro and here is a breakdown of the taxes I pay:

- Sales Tax 7.25% on everything except medicine
- Income Tax 7%
- Property Taxes $2400 for a 300k home
- Vehicle taxes $470 for a 30k vehicle, per year
- Storm water tax. When it rains we get taxed, a lot. 

We too have very little to show for it. Public transportation is expensive and unreliable, we frequently subsidize professional sports teams, and our transportation infrastructure within large metro areas is complete garbage. El Paso has 6 lane freeways, we have 3 lane freeways for a metroplex of 2.8 million.

I will say our taxes do include garbage pickup.

Yeah but the new real estate they build would still cost more because of the new people coming in from places that had more expensive housing. Im trying to explain to you why people might not be thrilled about more people moving in. Since it will cause a housing price increase even if they build more houses which they are doing.

That might be a good point. But still developers are probably gonna want the most money for their work. And if people move in from selling their homes at a high price from another area and then come here and buy homes for or above asking price consistently it will cause the housing prices to go up. And then the city will lose the affordability it once had leaving the original residents with less options for reasonably priced homes.

It's Super Guppy Turbine N941NA it's the last one of both the Super Guppies and the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser that's still flying. It was built back in the 60's to move parts for the Apollo program across the country. Usually parts to big to fit on freight trains or trucks without serious logistics problems. Still has its uses today and seems to be flying more often lately. I track it on Flight aware because it's just such a neat plane. If you ever see it flying its so big and slow it barely looks like it is moving.  It's home airport is here in El Paso.

"For those that may not know, the median means half of all sales were above that point and half were below that point.  About 4 years ago the El Paso median was $140,000 while Austin's was $220,000.  Also, the median for all Texas areas is rolled up into a state median, which is then rolled up with all other states to form a federal median, which is then converted to the Housing Price Index (HPI) often mentioned in the News.

El Paso has a lot of more modest homes compared to Austin.

The best real estate statistics come from [recenter.tamu.edu](https://recenter.tamu.edu), the official researchers for the state of Texas Real Estate Commission.

Why are prices heading higher?  Because inventory is abnormally low.  Like most major cities in America, El Paso has 1.6 Months Of Inventory (MOI). The market balance point is 6.5MOI.  Why is the inventory so low? See NYT article os one years ago *Where Have All The Houses Gone?*  In short there are 7 primary causes with 5 due to COVID, 1 due to artificially low interest rates and 1 due to fewer builders after the 2008 downturn.

"Check the total house payment. You could quite easily be paying more on a cheaper house in El Paso due to property taxes. Rent is not bad in El paso, buying is basically the equivalent of renting with the government as your landlord in El Paso. High taxes, and I mean HIGH. 
You also can take into account that there is no income tax in TX though. However, it honestly probably won't offset the property tax from the sound of it in your situation.

"Drivers were the worst in El Paso. Most people are nice but once behind a wheel, they are the most inconsiderate idiot drivers I've ever seen. The main issue is a complete lack of spatial awareness, this phenomenon is baffling as to how it affects so many people! El Paso driving culture is as follows:
Drive down the exact middle of every parking lot entrance/exit and lanes leaving no room for opposing traffic.
Swing wide on every left turn, meaning they will advance into your lane to make a simple left as if they were driving a massive 18 wheeler.
Habitual lane steppers. El Paso drivers constantly have their passenger side tires invading into another lane and will swerve about nonchalantly as they text. 
El Pasoans are preoccupied with backing into parking spaces as they are more concerned with going rather than coming. This is often a comical and disruptive endeavor. +1 for pickups, +10 for Cowboys plates.",t2_4cyuuokh,JoPublix,1,1647840075.0,0,t1_i1hwp68,i1hwp68,False,DrWrinkleBalls,t3_tilqdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/tilqdj/is_there_any_reason_i_should_not_move_to_el_paso/,Is there any reason I should not move to El Paso?,/r/ElPaso/comments/tilqdj/is_there_any_reason_i_should_not_move_to_el_paso/i1hwp68/,1,r/ElPaso,0,1

"I've been in El Paso since about 2007. Came for military and ended up staying because I wanted to pursue nursing and it was way easier to get into school here then back home in California.

El Paso has a lot of positive. I'm Anglo and don't speak Spanish and for the most part it's never been an issue. Families I serve are almost always pleasant and treat me like family.

Traffic has good and bad. For the most part you can go all over the city at a decent rate of speed so getting anywhere here is a breeze. The down side is that there is zero effort from City/EPPD to enforce laws on uninsured motorists, vehicles that are unsafe to be on road, Chihuahua plates vehicles, etc. EPPD also doesn't enforce/check paper plate checks either. So if you own a vehicle that only stays in El Paso, you technically never need to register it. People print out fake dealer plates and use them on their cars forever and since they avoid registering their vehicles you can bet they aren't insured. 

I worked closely with law enforcement as a nurse and can tell you that they have zero incentive to pull over someone with Chihuahua plates which gives some really awful drivers with unsafe vehicles freedom to do whatever they want. That said, not all drivers from Chihuahua are bad drivers.

I-10, 54, Spur and loop 375 are pretty nice to drive on, but outside of that the roads in El Paso are pretty awful. I've lived all over the country and never seen roads as bad as here. Also, if you're used to states like Arizona, New Mexico and California that have road engineers that plan for the future get ready for El Paso. Our city engineers that plan streets aren't the brightest. Get ready to see left hand turn lanes that were only built to accommodate three cars at a time that feed communities with 5,000 homes.

For housing, yes it's technically cheaper for the price of home but don't let that fool you. Objectively, I believe El Paso may have the highest (or near) property tax rate in Texas and the country. The property tax you'll pay on a $200,000 home here is the same as you would pay on a $600,000 home in Arizona/California/Washington. Rent is higher here too. The property taxes affect monthly rent and since the military has a designated BAH rate, even the worst of the worst apartments know to keep the minimum rent at the level of BAH.

Mexican food around here is incredible too.

"Okay, all that math is a lot less appealing in the cold light of day.

And I couldn't suss it out of the City's Proposed FY2022 Budget.  (We're already almost 6 months into FY2022 and according to the City Charter they're supposed to have their real budget out.)

But if the County's residential property tax share is 67.5% of all property taxes, then what might we infer about the City's?

The County doesn't participate in all the tax incentive programs that the City participates in.  Not all the 380 Agreements.  Not all the TIRZs.  The City's Economic Development Department reports $23.5 million in outside contracts in the Proposed FY2022 Budget.  Most of that money is 380 Agreements (I PIAed several years ago).

And adding the County's properties to the City's likely skews the split a little more residential, because there seems to be more residential properties (as a percentage) than the City.  Or maybe not.  All that farmland doesn't get counted as residential.

Too bad you don't know any journalists willing to track down all that information.  So all we can do is speculate.",t2_fh6ru,elrichiboy,0,1647532801.0,0,t1_i116tpt,i116tpt,False,JustChillingReviews,t3_tet4kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/tet4kc/el_paso_ranked_7th_least_affordable_us_city_by/,El Paso ranked 7th Least Affordable US City by GoodHire,/r/ElPaso/comments/tet4kc/el_paso_ranked_7th_least_affordable_us_city_by/i116tpt/,0,r/ElPaso,0,0

"I live in the Upper Valley.  A lot of the properties around Country Club and to the north past Borderland have small tract irrigation, so the land is flooded throughout the late spring and summer as we all irrigate.  The amount of mosquitoes can be quite atrocious, but as someone else mentioned, if you spray every few weeks, you should be ok.  The past couple of years the water allotment from the EPWCIPD1 has been going down, due to drought and low snowfalls in Colorado.  This translates to fewer irrigations, which in turn means fewer mosquitoes.  I think last year we only had 4 waterings which resulted in a lot fewer mosquitoes.  That being said, people are always surprised when they come to the house from out of town thinking that it will be the sand dunes of the Sahara only to see lush grass and trees everywhere.",t2_a43q4xii,FoldItBackandSlapIt,0,1647524547.0,0,t1_i10mra2,i10mra2,True,axaxs,t3_tf95kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/tf95kz/mosquitoes_in_upper_valley/,Mosquitoes in upper valley,/r/ElPaso/comments/tf95kz/mosquitoes_in_upper_valley/i10mra2/,5,r/ElPaso,0,5

"Thank you for citing your sources, but the 67.5% figure you cite is for the County of El Paso, and not for the City.  The County lowered its tax rate this year, because property values rose.  The City didn't.  They bragged about keeping the rate the same.  Even though valuations rose.

I've got the property valuations from the CAD, but now I'm going to have to do the ciphering to figure out residential versus commercial property taxes as a percentage of the City's General Fund. 

Also, what does M.E.O.P.T. mean?
