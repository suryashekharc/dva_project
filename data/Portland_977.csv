Andy Miller benefits directly financially form there being a homeless problem. This is like a warden of a prison hemming and hawing about a rule that could decrease the amount of prisoners.

Just like there have been numerous instances of those in ""corrections"" stacking the deck to make problems worse to enrich themselves, Andy Miller is doing the same here. 

Andy *wants* homelessness to be a huge problem, or else there's literally no paycheck for him. He should be the absolute last person to ask.

"Quoting: https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/nchav/resources/docs/mental-health/substance-abuse/Substance-Abuse-and-Homelessness-508.pdf

*Motivation to stop using substance may be low. For many homeless people, survival is more important than personal growth and development, and finding food and shelter take a higher priority than drug counseling.*  


* *Many homeless people have also become estranged from their families and friends. Without a social support network, recovering from a substance addiction is extremely difficult.*
* *Even if they do break their addictions, homeless people face the difficulty of resisting widely accessible substances in very near proximity (Fishet and Roget, 2009).*
* *Unfortunately, many treatment programs focus on abstinence only programming, which is less effective than harm reduction strategies and does not address the possibility of	relapse (National Health Care for the Homeless Council, 2007).*

*Substance abuse often occurs simultaneously with mental illness. People with untreated mental illness use street drugs as a form of self-medication. Homeless people with both	substance disorders and mental illness experience additional obstacles to recovery, such as increased risk for	violence and victimization and frequent cycling between the streets, jails and emergency rooms (Fisher and Roget, 2009). Unfortunately, these people are often unable to find treatment facilities that will help them.*",t2_8cekq4ol,thefancylemur,0,1648258089.0,0,t1_i2541os,i2541os,True,Liver_Lip,t3_tnz1kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/tnz1kr/people_for_portland_proposes_ballot_measure_to/,People for Portland Proposes Ballot Measure to Direct Tax Money to Provide More Shelter Beds,/r/Portland/comments/tnz1kr/people_for_portland_proposes_ballot_measure_to/i2541os/,3,r/Portland,0,3

">Andy Miller, executive director of Human Solutions, a homeless services nonprofit, says that by requiring cities to enforce camping laws in order to get funding, the People for Portland measure is an attempt to re-criminalize homelessness under the guise of helping homeless people.

>”They’re proposing a take-it-or-leave-it-approach of going to a shelter or not,” Miller said in an interview. “Shelters don’t work for everyone. We have data showing that when people are forced into shelters, it often doesn’t work, and they leave.

"All the academics and PHD policy makers want to delve into things to the Nth degree. Sometimes things are simple.

Drugs are bad (mmkay), and run counter to a happy and productive life.

Housing IS under-provided, but housing policy handed down from those same PHDs is implicated in creation of that problem. SRO have been outlawed in many zones for a long time now. We know SRO work to address the problem. 

There are resources available for people now. I work doing shitty labor with formerly homeless and drug addicted people in recovery. They have made a choice to help themselves, and tell me (who has never been outside) that others simply don't want to change. 

Academics need to push for ""more study"" to justify their grants and existence. Of course those involved in government policy are going to encourage growth of more programs that expand the government.

"Homeless people with pets is a particularly hard issue to navigate. Like you said, in a lot of cases the pets are well taken care of and provide important emotional support for the person. On the other hand, there’s another lot of cases where the pets are very poorly taken care of or even stolen, so it’s hard to imagine a one-size-fits-all solution where good pet owners keep theirs and negligent ones have theirs rehomed.

There’s also a significant population of housed people who would benefit from having a pet but can’t, whether it’s due to their lease agreement or schedule. Is the city obligated to require landlords to permit pets in general?

I’m more skeptical of the possessions argument though since many of the interviews I’ve read from homeless people from outlets like Street Roots or Portland Tribune are holding on to essentially meaningless junk like bike parts or lumber scraps. I’ve yet to see an interview of someone refusing shelter because they can’t bring a family heirloom or something irreplaceable, more typically something like “I have a lot of stuff”.

As for theft, the things being stolen that I’ve seen are rarely the essentials needed to get back on your feet. Did the guys camping in Mt Scott park *need* to steal my neighbor’s kid’s bike so he could throw it into his junk pile? Did the homeless guy in the Smart Park *need* to smash in my car window so he could have my Chrome backpack? I’m skeptical to say the least.

At a certain point, everyone needs to relinquish some self-determination to function in society. I wanted a pet for years before I found a place that would allow them and even then I had to put in a sizable deposit to make it happen; and with some of the damage I’ve seen from other peoples pets, I understand why. I’ve housed my friends in my basement before when they didn’t have anywhere else to go, but they had to understand I can’t turn my home into a self storage unit filled with unused furniture and appliances; which they understood completely.",t2_7rstk,Esqueda0,0,1648251578.0,0,t1_i24qge9,i24qge9,False,Liver_Lip,t3_tnz1kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/tnz1kr/people_for_portland_proposes_ballot_measure_to/,People for Portland Proposes Ballot Measure to Direct Tax Money to Provide More Shelter Beds,/r/Portland/comments/tnz1kr/people_for_portland_proposes_ballot_measure_to/i24qge9/,17,r/Portland,0,17

"No, it is a result at America's half assed version of harm reduction.

Actual harm reduction wouldn't have people overdosing in the streets and dropping needles everywhere. Because actual harm reduction considered the entire community including addicts and is a lot more than decriminalization, Narcan, and needles for all.


> Switzerland, France and other European countries health officials find safe consumption facilities help drive down rates of disease transmission, overdose and even consumption.


> Switzerland led Europe with the first drug consumption rooms and heroin assisted treatment facilities. The Swiss approach is all about removing barriers and getting the majority of drug users into treatment. This resulted in trickled down benefits for law enforcement as the street drug market weakened and the theft rate dropped.


> The French approach is about seeing drug users as people first and supporting the whole person. There are more than 300 harm reduction centers, that include needle exchanges, places to shower, do laundry, meet with social workers, psychiatrists and medical doctors. In addition to that, there are 480 addiction treatment facilities. The whole network works together to support drug users to live their best lives.

"You won't fix homelessness with shelter beds until you stop making people give up their possessions and pets for a few nights indoors.

Arguments that they shouldn't have pets are meaningless because many DO have pets, and will not give them up, pets are often the only thing keeping a homeless person sane or alive..

Arguments that they should give up all but two suitcases or bags for a few days inside are foolish because they know they will need those things again in a week when they are out of time in the shelter. Also making them give up possessions only increases property theft when those items are needed again.

Arguments that people are refusing because they are drug users are pointless because they can't magically become un-addicted instantly in order to stay in shelter.

">What about the people who don’t want the beds and just want to smoke meth and shoot up.

So my understanding is that once there are enough beds they can start enforcing more of a no-camping policy. 

I thought a court ruled that you can't ban camping if you don't provide a viable alternative.

"Calling bullshit.

""Average"" asking rent in Portland is $2455????  There is no indication as far I could see about what type of apartment or house it is.   Also, is this just based on Redfin listings?  Sounds like it is.  So, that in itself means these prices are coming from landlords who can afford to pay for ads on Redfin, which means higher end and newer buildings.   

Also, most places cannot, according to Portland City code, raise year over year prices more than 10%.  Yes, buildings newer than 15 years are exempt, but the majority of places collecting rent are older than this.  Certainly, 39% does not include very many of these older buildings.

Finally, typically these surveys neglect to include many or even all of Portland east of 82nd Ave.   Because of this, almost always these survey over-estimate the cost of apartments in Portland.   East of 82nd is nearly 1/3 of the city, and it is also typically has rents below the average.   It is not clear that this is the case here, but this is a survey of 20K apartments NATIONWIDE, so clearly is not a comprehensive survey of Portland itself.     There are about 250K apartments and houses for rent in Portland, at most this survey probably includes 1% of properties in Portland.",t2_bfuvs,jonjacobmoon,0,1648246161.0,0,t1_i24eepv,i24eepv,True,IAintSelling,t3_to1liz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/to1liz/raising_rent_prices_in_us_cities_were_2/,Raising rent prices in U.S. cities (We're #2!),/r/Portland/comments/to1liz/raising_rent_prices_in_us_cities_were_2/i24eepv/,1,r/Portland,0,1

">Destroying property with the intent to compel behavior is a form of violence - in some cases considered domestic terrorism.

Yeah and historically protests turned riots are never considered legally terrorism. The intent of the protests have _never_ been about intimidation. The destruction that occurred was pretty damn tame for American riots and they never formed specifically with property damage as then intent, though it often was the byproduct. And they never turned into a mob forcing their way into buildings and trying to kill or hang specific people. (Cough jan 6). Most of the property damage was done by a minority of the participants.

"Good question. One person is better, cause there is set limits, also dark money PAC’s has less limits. The ideal …is many small donor donations, because then you are representing a populace…which is democracy. Corporations and large donors want something in return…basically bribery. Logically they want a calculated return on investment.

Then there is the multiple of ways, of hiding money in shell companies that can go into pacs, money from other countries. There is a reason Sheldon Adelson owned casinos in other countries and was a large donor. There is a reason our current President is from Delaware, the land friendly to shell companies. There is also reason our last president had a casino in Panama. Not to mention hiding money in crypto, or giving gifts or property to relatives and friends of politicians. The real estate market is ripe for that.

It’s not perfect, this system is gamed, but outwardly abstaining from corporate donors and large dark money PAC, shows that you are a more transparent candidate.

It disinvites more corruption, you speak more to the populace, and gets a person possibly to the table that can make stricter campaign finance laws and level the scales to be less oligarchy and more democracy.",t2_8m08z,Projectrage,0,1648244453.0,0,t1_i24ai65,i24ai65,False,synapticrelease,t3_tlv5pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/tlv5pa/announcement_ama_with_multnomah_county_chair/,[Announcement] AMA with Multnomah County Chair candidate Sharia Mayfield on March 27 @ 5pm!.,/r/Portland/comments/tlv5pa/announcement_ama_with_multnomah_county_chair/i24ai65/,1,r/Portland,0,1

"The comments are, I think, generally focusing on the fact that this article and headline are placing the responsibility of medical training and Narcan purchasing on the restaurants and staff. Which is a wild thing to say. 

Restaurants and their employees have had a hell of a couple years and saying “restaurants in Portland are not focused on risk reduction” is placing them at the forefront of a huge medical crisis. They don’t deserve that. It’s a tough industry as is, the social responsibility to call 911 and help of you can is enough.

I don't think that a lot of recreational drug users are aware of how much more risk there is these days of getting fent in their shit.  I am not talking about the guy that buys a gram of coke every weekend or the person taking xanax every day.  There are people (some of whom I know) who are just regular square types with a 401k and a family that just like to go out and party a few times a year.  There is just as much risk to them getting fentanyl and dying as anyone else.  What is being talked about in this article (providing  free testing strips for patrons and OD kits for the staff) would probably alert the casual user to the situation and provide a way to test what they have to prevent an OD.

Same kind of mentality as having a door person or bouncer.  It is a preventative measure that is a good idea but not required by law.  As far as I could tell the article didn't even suggest that bar staff would be required to do anything in the event of an OD, just that they have the tools to deal with it and the (very very) basic training on how to use it.

"1. cost (Narcan isn't free, though it should be)
2. Liability, no thank you. I am trained and certified and indemnified, ANYONE working at a bar isn't

But, your really gonna stand there and watch someone die because you only get paid $15 an hour plus tips? that sounds like a shitty response to me personally (though I have ALL the feels for the low paying job that is a service industry position, trust me.)

"There’s an expectation for a regular BUSINESS to stock drugs to reverse opioids that are taken at the free will of their patrons? If it was a situation where the facility ADMINISTERED opioids (like a hospital), sure. But a place that sells food and drink? Absolutely not. Leave that to EMS. I believe that addiction is a disease, but this is a bad idea, imo (saying this as an ICU RN).

This brings an unreasonable level liability to these business owners (based on the bad choices of their patrons). There are a litany of reasons why someone might be somnolent, and these reversal agents are not necessarily innocuous either.

I’m all for helping people, with my career choice as an example, but there is a limit. Unfortunately, consequences do exist for bad life choices. When you get past a certain point, society should not be expected to compensate for bad decisions.

"In the current context it doesn't matter whether any of the neighborhoods have a majority minority population. Only that the population still is disproportionately impacted by the racist policies outlined before.

 Back in 2009 30% of NE Portlanders were black. Despite the fact that poor minorities are being disproportionately pushed out of Portland, to this day, the minority populations in many of the NE neighborhoods are double the Portland average and poverty is about 16% higher.

Unsurprisingly, NE Portland is 13F hotter than the rest of Portland due to redlining leading to development patterns that cause island effect and high pollution.

https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7q8v4/racist-housing-policies-have-created-dangerous-heat-islands-in-portland-denver

Another thing you can look at is the majority minority schools. Which somehow still exist despite the overall demographic of any neighborhoods. These still follow the national pattern of being underfunded and over polluted due to location selection for highways and other polluters.

You have governemt policy that caused poverty, increased temperatures specifically for neighborhoods where minorities were forced to live, and as a result of many of those policies the people living there are often more likely to have medical conditions that are exacerbated by the heat while simultaneously having less access to care and when they get care worse outcome for doctors.

Basically, a bunch of small shit piles on top of each other to make climate change disproportionately bad for minorities even here.
