I was moving units so I was fine with just the floor plan. 

Well the floor plan was wrong. Like the laundry was in the main floor bedroom closet NOT in a shared space. There was no pantry, it was listed but it was just not there. Bathroom linen closet? Nope. 

I got $200/month off rent and $500 off moving fees(I overlapped a few days)

I called it a 1 bedroom plus den, people were pretty shocked to walk in and see a second level.

"> What I don’t understand is why, as a restaurant owner trying to entice people back downtown, you would spend so much time talking about how much it sucks. If you were worried that public safety concerns were coloring people’s perception of the neighborhood and contributing to its slow rebound, wouldn’t you make sure you had your crime stats straight before you spread it around as fact? You’re only hurting yourself!

I've been questioning this behavior from Downtown business owners (and people like Steve Cramer) since the start of the pandemic. Downtown has been generally insulated from the crime surge, you should be touting that! Instead, their rhetoric has fueled this hyperbolic perception that won't go away for decades, likely.

go but now i am forced to respond, This is your opinion and one that seems to be more in line with far right thinking. To think that everyone has to have similar beliefs, values or priorities in order to get along is completely illogical.

>you completely ignored the fact that huge numbers of parents inMinneapolis are open-enrolling their children in public schools... thatjust happen to be in suburbs

I thought I touched on this when I was talking about a complete overhaul of the education system, but i guess it wasn't clear enough, this point is totally correct, when parents are busing their kids to different districts that creates artificial stress on those public school leading to further economic problems for the schools.

&#x200B;

>Just so we are clear, charter schools in Minneapolis are predominantly attended by black and brown children. I hate to generalize but I’m guessing these parents aren’t Republicans?

I tried to find any sort of demographic stat that lines up with what you claiming here and I couldn't find anything, if you could get me a source on that I'd be happy to be corrected. I did find a claim that there were more poor kids in charter schools than in public schools in Minneapolis but there was no information on race, at least that I could find. Yeah, you are generalizing there, there is plenty of black and brown parents that vote republican that just kinda silly to even write that out.

&#x200B;

>So, you can try to spin the failures of MPS as purely a funding issue, but the facts don’t really back you up.

Yeah, its not just a funding issue, its a culture issue, its a state wide issue, its a issue that involves everything going on in the nation at current time, I never claimed that it was just a funding issue.

"You seem to be confused on the history of public schools and private/charter schools. Private schools were the norm pre-american industrial boom, because peasants couldn't afford to send their children to be educated, that was a middle class privilege, public schools then came into being as most of America (white protestants) became apart of the middle class. The mass public had public schools as their main form of education for many decades until the 1980's when Republicans on mass took their children out of public schools and placed them into private schools because they disagreed with what the students were being taught. This led to budget issues in the public school sector where as the private sector rose to take many of the parents and donations that were being used on those local public schools. Decades later, now the public schools are begging for money to stay afloat while private schools are continuing to take students, parents, and funding away from public schools and there's nothing that can be done about it without a complete overhaul of our education system.",t2_beioi9c8,Duster_beattle,0,1648232271.0,0,t1_i23gq9a,i23gq9a,False,RyanWilliamsElection,t3_tnjt3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tnjt3h/minneapolis_teachers_district_reach_deal_to_end/,"Minneapolis teachers, district reach deal to end strike",/r/Minneapolis/comments/tnjt3h/minneapolis_teachers_district_reach_deal_to_end/i23gq9a/,3,r/Minneapolis,0,3

And communities (like all societies) are strongest when they are made of up of people with similar values, beliefs and priorities.  Now that our community (Minneapolis) is so divided, and so many parents have decided that MPS does not share these criteria with them, how are we to function as a coherent school system?   Especially, when charter schools, open-enrollment in suburban schools, and private schools are siphoning off more and more kids every year.

"None of this surprises me. They are the laziest people I have ever met. It takes two seconds to go upstairs and check on the unit to make sure it’s ready for a tour. 

I’ve seen people touring get stuck on the elevator for 30+ minutes, get shown around a trashed amenity floor with party residue and trash cans overflowing from multiple days past without even batting an eye, the pool and hot tub are regularly green because they never service them, the garage door has been broken since last October, we’ve had so many cars stolen out of the public parking ramp we can’t even keep track, an armed car jacking at gunpoint in the garage which has no cameras (how?), guns pulled on the sixth floor party room from the crowd they let just stream through the front door, houseless persons sleeping in the lobby, regular dog piss and shit all over the place because nobody cleans up after their mutts, the cabana awnings outside have ripped off and have never been replaced, the outdoor pool is shut down for weeks at a time in the summer because people keep bringing glass, water regularly turned off for full days multiple times a month, etc. 

The list goes on. I have never in my life seen a building so new have so many issues, and complete apathy with management. The fact that they think they can justify their rates for some units is absolutely hysterical. 

That said, if you don’t mind being a small amount of a Karen, you can basically guarantee your rent never goes up, because I’ve got about four pages of issues that have happened in just the last year I’ll be using to tell them why I’m not paying an increase. And judging by the types of people they are letting live in this building (basically if you can form a sentence and sign your name), they desperately need people who are actually going to pay their rent. 

I’ve made some good friends in this building and the location is stellar, minus how awful Loring Park has been getting, but this place is overpriced and is run like a motel 6.

"In my opinion it's the best neighborhood in Minneapolis overall, and I'll admit I'm totally biased.  Centrally located in the Twin Cities, close access to just about every major highway/interstate.  94/55/62/35W/35E are all super close or within a 5 or so minute drive.  Great for getting to the airport and back when you need to.  There's tons of fantastic little shops/restaurants and a great movie theater.  Lots of authentic restaurants you won't get in the suburbs (Mexican, Indian, Ethiopian, Himalayan, Somali, Japaneese and more), tons of good restaurants nearby (Craftsman, Blue Door, Longfellow, Hi-Lo), and all of that is within a small area, there are a ton of little places everywhere.   It's a little pricey to live in, but at the cost of what you pay you get amazing value for your money.  The housing prices during the last housing bust stayed pretty damn stable.  There are parks/green areas everywhere (and if you live closer to the river there is a TON of hidden green area near the river that you wouldn't even know is there unless you look for/stumble across it.  The Falls are right here, tons of good breweries (especially Venn!), a couple distilleries (Lawless, Du Nord) great access to the light rail, good bus access (especially the A line and the future buss rapid transit line that will go down Lake Street in 2? years).  It is very walkable, the people are friendly, it always feels safe.  If you want to bike, there are great trails and lots of bike lanes.  I'm a United fan and it's stupid easy to get to and from games (maybe 10 minutes).  We have access to a bunch of good grocery stores (Cub, Longfellow Market, Reedy's, Lunds/Byerlys if you cross over to Ford Parkway, and Kowalskis if you take a slightly longer drive over to Grand Ave). 

It's a very hidden gem, and houses go pretty darn quickly around here.  My partner and I are about your age, but without kids.  There are a lot of our peers in the neighborhood as well and there are plenty of kids from what I've seen about your kids age.  There are A LOT of people here who grew up in the neighborhood and have bought houses in the neighborhood too so in my opinion there is a great neighborhood feel and a lot of pride.  

I know I sound like I'm overhyping it, and yes I live here so I'm biased, but I've bought here before (around 2005-2010) and came back again 5 years ago.  It's really a great place to live.  The only problem I've had in the combined 10 years I've lived here overall was with the rioting that happened around the 3rd precinct two years ago, but that didn't really get into the residential areas and was mainly on Lake Street and Hiawatha Ave and didn't go far from those streets.  That being said it was reassuring to see the neighbors coming out to protect/help each other and our business and out cleaning up our neighborhood afterwards.  The residents of Longfellow are proud and caring of their neighborhood.

"It’s hardly THE MOST environmentally unsound. Is it somehow less environmentally safe to maintain the grass on a golf course than the grass on the many massive sports facilities/parks that host baseball, football, or soccer? What’s unsound is your dumb little game in absolutes. Literally any other sport you say? Shall I take up motor boat racing? Maybe motocross, then I can start advocating for more forest regions to be cut down to make room for dirt tracks and the like. Plus we gotta make roads to get there.

Don’t pretend like there are no modern eco friendly ways to maintain a golf course. Such as recycled rain watering systems, eco friendly fertilizers and the like. And I’m all for enforcing regulations to make it a requirement, force older courses to upgrade, all of it.

I’m not saying we should drain the lake by any means, and clearly the course has flooding problems, but it’s a healthy sport, particularly for kids. Gets them outside and active without the threat of head injuries and such that go along with contact sports.

This particular course has been there for 90 years and is the most affordable around. Like someone else mentioned in the thread, it was the only place I could go with my crappy hand me down clubs and a couple of bucks to practice. I think there’s a happy medium here.

"TL;DR half of the golf course will become wetlands to mitigate flooding.


The 18-hole golf course and Lake Hiawatha are unsustainable, subject to flooding and polluted.

Many submissions were made for what to do with these properties, all owned by the parks department. One submission was a “public sex forest.” I’m not sure if that one was ever officially submitted, but it’s hilarious and this sub loves it.

The lake was manmade back in the 1920s. It was essentially a pond and swamp. The pond was dredged to create a small lake. The excess dirt was dumped nearby and the golf course was created.

Fast forward a century and sediment has made the lake more shallow. That and climate change has created a higher water table. The parks department now pumps a shitload of water out of the lake to keep the water table down. This allows the golf course to stay open, and is extremely expensive. The pumping also keeps neighborhood homes from having water seep into their basements.

The plan moving forward is to return half of the golf course into wetlands so that the pumping is no longer necessary.",t2_64k8bms,JayKomis,0,1648183051.0,0,t1_i2108fy,i2108fy,False,CaptOnaway,t3_tna0as,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tna0as/in_memory_of_lake_hiawatha/,In memory of Lake Hiawatha,/r/Minneapolis/comments/tna0as/in_memory_of_lake_hiawatha/i2108fy/,173,r/Minneapolis,2,173

"Run away from LPM Apartments in Loring Park. Don’t be deceived by the 36 story glass high rise- it’s managed like a hostel by Greystar. The reviews do t do justice to just how bad it really is. Great views and apartments are nice if not basic (even for being built in 2014), but the place is literally falling apart and in disrepair because of their negligent incompetence as management.

Third party billing I’m sure is already done at the school. This school is gonna need at least 50 million a year to meet half of what the teachers are looking for.

">	You make a good point, let’s get rid of all the mountain bike trails too. Mountain bikes are more expensive than golf clubs.

Mountain bike trials are very low maintenance and also don’t take up much valuable space. All some trails like the Minnesota River Bottoms double as a hiking trail. 

>	Baseball is also expensive to join a league and buy equipment, so zap those too. 

You can get a used glove and bat for under $50. And you don’t even need to pay to use the field during most of the day. That’s a key piece you’re forgetting. Most other recreations facilities are free and open to the public for the majority of the day and only need to be reserved during busy times. That’s not the same with golf. When can I go to a golf course and play a round for free?

>You can easily buy used golf gear for 100 bucks and play for around $20 at the city courses. So any activity that costs more than that should be banned.

Never said golfing should be banned. Don’t throw out strawmans. I said you should consider the cost as it relates to limiting people’s access and desire to partake in that activity. 

>	How many different people play baseball? Does every resident of the neighborhood have to rotate into a pickup game of hardball to make baseball diamonds valuable under your made up guidelines?  They take up a lot of space that i can’t use

Do you know how big a baseball field is? It’s about 3 acres compared to the 140ish acres that Hiawatha Golf Course takes up. So you can’t just compare 1 baseball field. You’d be comparing 45 of them. But really that means you could have 45 similar sized areas for various activities instead of the golf course which is single use. 

Not to mention, people play spikeball, football, cricket, and plenty of other sports in that space. Try and play spikeball on a golf course and tell me how it goes.",t2_pcyi1,Sproded,0,1648171639.0,0,t1_i20cw48,i20cw48,False,TaeWFO,t3_tlciws,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tlciws/last_night_golfers_proposed_we_drain_lake_hiawatha/,Last Night Golfers Proposed We Drain Lake Hiawatha,/r/Minneapolis/comments/tlciws/last_night_golfers_proposed_we_drain_lake_hiawatha/i20cw48/,1,r/Minneapolis,0,1

"As a Labor Rep and negotiator, it can be very hard to make Apples to Apples comparisons across employers ( school districts). Your table is informative however it does have a few large holes. First, I'd look at step advancement, where do teachers start on the scale and how long does it take to get to the top. 

In my comparisons, I'd use FTE equivalency, how much does an employee cost in total including insurance, deferred comp and all other benefits. The employer often makes an argument that these all come from the same budget. 


I'd also point out, as someone who went to graduate school for education, that it is a very expensive decision. Teachers spend an entire career paying down those loans.

Finally, I think the messaging is clear that ESP ( paraprofessional) compensation is the biggest priority. $35K is a reasonable ask.

"> it's dyslexia friendly

It's not.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Dyslexia/comments/na2h1x/is_writing_in_all_lowercase_unaccessible_for/

Most of the conversation around dyslexia comes in regards to the learning aspect of language. Most people with dyslexic tendencies or learning challenges do best when things aren't different than what their mind expects. Most dyslexic people have learned the normal pattern of writing after years of it, and struggle with deviations from it.

For instance, while it's true that it's easier for dyslexic preschoolers to learn in all caps initially, there is no indication that you should continue to use all caps, or all lowercase past the initial phase of education.

https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide

If you look at the style guide here, you will note that the whole style guide can be boiled down to, ""Keep it simple and don't do anything wild.""


https://uxmovement.com/content/6-surprising-bad-practices-that-hurt-dyslexic-users/

I can find no indication that this justification holds any water.

Also, the common suggestions for dyslexic fonts didn't hold up to clinical study, last I saw.

>it makes me less worried about seeming judgmental or intimidating in online spaces

This isn't something that is conveyed through lowercase letters, it's something conveyed through word choice. It certainly makes people more judgemental of you though. There is value in coming across as someone who has enough education to effectively communicate through text; it means people are more likely to take you seriously.

I think these links help confirm it. If you look at the local section of each districts budget, Minneapolis is about 31% from property taxes and Hopkins is about 48%.
