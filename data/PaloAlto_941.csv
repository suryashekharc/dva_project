">After failing to make progress on new bikeways in south Palo Alto, the City Council agreed on Monday night to give up more than $900,000 in federal funding for the project.

>The funding, which was provided to the city in 2017, was intended for the construction of separated bike paths and traffic-calming measures on segments of East Meadow Drive and Fabian Way, as well as at the Waverley Avenue multiuse bike path between East Meadow and East Charleston Road, next to Mitchell Park. The project would have been funded through a grant program known as the Vehicle Emissions Reductions Based at Schools (VERBS), which focuses on prominent school corridors. The segment in south Palo Alto includes JLS Middle School and Fairmeadow and Herbert Hoover elementary schools and Kehillah High School.

>Despite initial enthusiasm among city staff and the Palo Alto City Council, the project never took off. Residents along East Meadow raised alarms about the prospect of losing about 80 parking spots east of Middlefield Road to make way for a protected bikeway, which they claimed is not needed in this area. Facing opposition, the council agreed in August to revise the proposal and settle for narrowing car lanes and adding green paint and road markings designating the roads as a bike route.

>On Monday, the council dealt the project a major blow when it voted 5-1, with Greg Tanaka dissenting and Tom DuBois absent, to relinquish the grant funding, which was awarded by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) through the One Bay Area Grant 2 program (VERBS is a program within the OBAG grant). The $919,000 grant stipulated that the city must initiate construction by January 2023.",t2_122uxk,megachainguns,0,1648219687.0,0,t1_i22kib9,i22kib9,True,megachainguns,t3_tnnjl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/tnnjl3/council_gives_up_grant_funding_for_south_palo/,Council gives up grant funding for south Palo Alto bike projects,/r/paloalto/comments/tnnjl3/council_gives_up_grant_funding_for_south_palo/i22kib9/,7,r/paloalto,0,7

"Damn.

Graduate of Gunn, pre-suicide times, early aughts. I wish you the best! I feel like things are so much harder for teens today, especially in Palo Alto. Such a bummer, it really came with the culture change of (upper middle class when I was growing up) to everyone is upper class and seems to expect their kids to be able to achieve similar status if not wealth as them? It's been getting harder and harder to be able to afford to live in Palo Alto over the generations. The gap between poor and rich keeps getting larger all across the U.S. But it's totally fine to move to a much less expensive area as an adult. Most people do. I did for a long time. Even very successful fellow Gunn graduates are utterly horrified by Palo Alto real estate prices. It's okay not to become what your parents are and not to compete with your parents, (in my opinion).

I'll be happy if my baby chooses a career that keeps him comfortable and hopefully supports a family, even if it's something like electrician without a college degree. 4-year college is important, but I also know it's not for everyone. Employers, even when they require a degree, seem to largely want ""experience"" so they don't have to invest in training. (eye roll)Recently looked starting a college fund for baby. It turned out that the recommended amount to save was based on Stanford tuition. My husband blurted out loud, ""Stanford is the Worst Case Scenario"" and I just laughed and laughed hearing Stanford called that!

I think it's important to do what you can, but I know from other's failings (dying) that it's important to stop short of pressuring yourself into misery/chronic stress.

"\*Stanford\* students. Do you know what it takes to get into Stanford? HELLA NOT puppets, woodwork or anything fun and artsy. It's extraordinarily competitive. Ok, you can do a PhD in Drama there and they have music and stuff, but still, drama students who strive to become professors at elite colleges...very serious business. The weirdos who get into Stanford transfer elsewhere.

There are a few local community colleges, but again they are mostly super normie.  Canada College in Redwood City has a Fashion Design program. I'm not sure how many of the students will be rainbow haired, but they will be creative! (RWC is very small, so I wouldn't recommend living there.)

For local-ish college towns with weirdos, maybe try Santa Cruz? (And of course, the larger cities of San Jose, SF, Oakland, Berkeley.)

"If you’re not from California, you have to at least try a taqueria! My favorite is El Grullense on El Camino Real, although it’s gotten kind of expensive. It’s a true taqueria though.

I also really like Local Union 271 on University Avenue (downtown) for lunch or breakfast, although the vibe on the weekends for brunch is really loud with weird trance music playing (not sure if you’re in to that) so I would definitely go on a weekday. I recommend their chicken pot pie or a burger, but they have great veg options too. It’s truly one of my favorites.

On Sundays, there is the California Avenue farmers market which is nice to stroll around in. I live walking distance, so if you want some company if you go, just let me know!

"Evvia Estiatorio has a small bar counter you can dine at. Try the saghanaki & lamb souvlaki.

Cafe Pro Bono is a quiet eatery on California Ave. Try the Susan's Downfall.

Coupa Cafe is a downtown coffee shop. Their coffee + ham & cheese croissant are supreme.

La Bodeguita del Medio is a great cuban restaurant on California Ave. Try the Ropa Vieja.

Pastis on California Ave. Nice brunch & the burger is fantastic. Their sister restaurant, Joanies Cafe, up the street shares most of the menu if they're too busy.

"-PA creamery (not to be confused with Peninsula creamery down the street - also good but more of a to-go spot.). Sit at the counter and get a burger and shake! Always tons of single diners there. 

-Ramen Nagi if you have time to wait, or just go at like 4:30

-NOLA has the best hurricanes west of Louisiana and great southern food - tons of seating including a lively bar area. Go for happy hour for giant $8 drinks!


-Bar Zola is really good higher-end bites and cocktails and you can usually get a seat at the bar during off times

-San Agus is soo good for cocktails and mexican small plates, they have a small bar and lots of high-top tables that are good for one

-Orens hummus is a bay area classic for Israeli food, casual setting

-Jing Jing and Steam both awesome for Chinese

-Get a beer and a hot dog at Rose and Crown - legendary silicon valley beer pub

-Giant margaritas at the Reposado bar

-Best mexican (IMO) is palo alto sol on cal ave - get the pollo guajillo

-Hate to say it as a PA native but the sushi bar at Nobu is worth a stop if you haven’t been. Otherwise Daigo on Cal ave is my fave sushi.

"Well, you're certainly hitting some of the best places already in your business dinners.

You'd be remiss if you don't get sushi, and most sushi places have a bar. The best one is actually in Mountain View, Sushi Tomi (if they've finished remodeling), but Fuki Sushi (just off El Camino in a very confusing little triangle with El Camino Way) is also very good, if a little unnecessarily upscale. The bar is usually the only place you can sit without a reservation anyway.

Likewise you have to visit a taquería, and those tend to be pretty casual. There are two Sancho's, Como Esta, El Grullense, Tacolicious, and maybe some others. Palo Alto Sol and Celia's can give you a broader class of Mexican cuisine; those have full table service but I think Celia's might seating at the bar? Reposado, downtown, is technically also Mexican if you just want to spend a lot of money on fancy cuisine.

Terún on Cal Ave is extremely popular and I think they might have bar seating, though you probably didn't come to the US to get Neapolitan pizza. For American-style pizza, Legends, Pizza Chicago, and maybe also Howie's sell it by the slice and have casual seating arrangements. There are lots of other pizza chains if you want the authentic trashy experience, though some are mainly meant for delivery and takeout.

Don't miss Zareen's, which is fairly casual and somewhat cafeteria-style so you can just grab a table. Good for lunch too.

For breakfast or brunch, Joanie's on California Avenue is great, and I think they might still have bar seating indoors as well as their new outdoor tables, though it's hard to get a seat anywhere at peak hours.

At some point you should stroll around California Avenue and the University Avenue neighborhood (we have two downtowns) and just see what looks good.",t2_31wm44k1,throwaway9834712935,0,1646521915.0,0,t1_hzic5ru,hzic5ru,True,kanavera,t3_t7imul,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/t7imul/dining_alone/,Dining alone,/r/paloalto/comments/t7imul/dining_alone/hzic5ru/,15,r/paloalto,0,15

"There are some changes coming to the rail usage that will likely change things one way or the other.

Although it's taking years of planning delays, the rough plan is to grade-separate the nearest crossing (Meadow). This will end the requirement for the freight trains to honk, as that requirement is only for non-separated crossings. Noise wise, this seems like an obvious improvement.

Caltrain is also electrifying (note the poles & wires behind the backyard). They are still working on the infra and running, I think, diesel engines. Once moving to electric I'd guess that the low rumble of the diesel engines will abate, while there could be some new noise from the electric contacts.

All that said, I know this neighborhood well and it's a stellar location.

"Peer’s Park is nearby Stanford and is, in my opinion, the best toddler playground in the area. California Ave is nearby and has many dining options. Mollie Stones has a really good selection of sandwiches and usually someone is at their sushi counter so you can get them to make toddler friendly sushi such as Inari. 

I really love Asian Box for takeout. 

Stanford can be hit or miss with toddlers. When school is in session all the bicycles can be a bit nerve wracking. There is an Andy Goldsworthy sculpture near the Cantor Arts Center that was always a big hit with my own toddlers. Burgess Park and Nealon Park in Menlo Park are arguably closer to Stanford Hospital than many Palo Alto parks.

"Takeout spots:

* Zareens, as mentioned
* Slice House is pretty solid pizza-wise
* Depending on where you are traveling from, In-n-Out is a California institution. (Drive Thru)
* Oren's Hummus works well for takeout
* If you don't mind sitting outside instead of takeout, the Udon at Taro San in the mall would be really close and are tasty.
* Port of Peri Peri if you like spicy; works well for takeout

For Toddler entertainment:

* If you're not from an area with trains, go ride and/or watch the Caltrain.
* Look behind (at the behind) of the [totem pole at Stanford](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=stanford+totem+pole&ia=web&iaxm=maps&strict_bbox=0&bbox=37.4327843902889%2C-122.17489394714353%2C37.42431561358434%2C-122.16064605285642).

* The big steel sculpture behind the Cantor art museum is fun for kids to run through.  Also the Goldsworthy ""Stone River"" half-buried across the street from the art museum.
* There are also the cactus garden and the Mausoleum very close to Stanford hospital and maybe interesting.
* A bit further afield, Magical Bridge playground at Mitchell Park is pretty novel.

"All I can say is boy am I glad I narrowly escaped being in school during the pandemic. I don’t have much more to add to the discussion beyond: making any kind of decision here seems ludicrously tough. Most people in the PAUSD are unlikely to be affected by the novel strains of Covid. Some may have serious symptoms. A vanishingly few may require hospitalization or even parish. Pushing schools to “get back to the way things were” unequivocally benefits the masses, though. But at the potential cost of the vulnerable minority. Count me out from positions of leadership at the moment.

Likely we’re all adults here, but has anyone stopped to wonder what the kids think of this? Ultimately school is all they know right now.

"I once lived on the corner of Alma and Rinconada. The train was very loud and the long freight trains slightly shook the house. I got very used to it. Our family did have a joke, though, that the train was always bound to go by during the most exciting moment of dialog in any movie or TV show we were watching.

During the morning and evening commute there are many trains, but outside of those times, there are only about 2 trains an hour. It could be a problem if you have an unusual schedule, like if you were a nurse who needed to sleep through the morning. If you have a typical 9-5 work schedule, then you are likely to be awake and active when the most trains are going by.

I found the sound of a loud freight train at 10pm to be quite cozy actually. Even if you live a couple blocks away, you will hear the train. I find Caltrain to be much more pleasant than the sound of living near a BART train track or the sound of living near a major freeway.",t2_zhed2,doctorboredom,0,1641452639.0,0,t1_hrgnojd,hrgnojd,True,spicyavocadoranch,t3_rx6cwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/rx6cwr/train_noise/,Train Noise,/r/paloalto/comments/rx6cwr/train_noise/hrgnojd/,7,r/paloalto,0,7

"I used to live about a block off of alma. The train going by isn’t that bad in my opinion. If you live next to a live intersection (Churchill/DT) then it is much louder because it honks going through the intersection. It’s definitely noticeable but I wouldn’t consider it awful/unbearable. My dishes/house didn’t rattle but I guess that depends on your house. 

You can check out the Caltrain website for the number of trains… probably every 30 minutes or so but I only heard them at night when it was quiet.

"I have lived in Palo Alto for 30+ years.  The Bay Area is no slouch when it comes to outdoor activities.  Hiking, trail running, road biking, and mountain biking have large, active communities. 

Having said that, SLC is probabably hard to beat, just because the Bay area has 7 million people and you won't find the near-wilderness you'll find around SLC.  And of course, there is no snow-sports in the Bay Area.  For that, you'll have drive to the Sierra.  OTOH, the Bay area has the ocean while SLC does not.

After 30+ years, the Bay Area has definitely gotten more crowded and I miss the emptiness and uncrowded spaces.  For that reason, I live part-year in Squamish BC to get that experience back where wilderness is practically out my back-door, and the MTB scene is super-intense.

"I have lived in the SF Bay Area all my life. I have spent the last 11 years living in the  Palo Alto/Menlo Park area raising my two kids.

It is hard for me to be super positive, because this area has lost so much open space in my lifetime and, to me, it just all feels so crowded.

On multiple occasions, I have tried taking my kids to a hiking location on the weekend, only to find parking lots that were too full for us to visit. If you are stuck to a school schedule, you end up competing for space with a lot of other people.

Booking campsites can be incredibly hard. I know a couple without kids who is really into backpacking and hiking and they have a really difficult time booking campgrounds in popular places like Yosemite. I am a teacher and go camping with my class. Six months prior to our camping trip, we were barely able to reserve our campsite. Within minutes of the booking window opening up, almost the entire campground was already reserved.

So, activities which are going to involve space in a parking lot, or a reserved campground can be quite frustrating due to how many people are in California.

In addition, it is true that we are near the ocean in Palo Alto, but keep in mind that Northern California beaches are VASTLY different from Southern California beaches. Many beaches in Northern California are plagued by dangerous riptides, frigid waters and fog. While there ARE beaches up here that have good swimming, they are all at least a 1 hour drive from Palo Alto and if you are trying to do it on a weekend factor in extra traffic. My mom, lives in Monterey, and the beaches are amazing there, but they are also at a minimum a 90 minute drive. There have been times, though, when that drive took 3-4 hours due to traffic. 

Palo Alto IS a bicycling paradise. If you enjoy riding bikes on roads, then this is quite simply one of the most incredible places in the US due to the combination of sunny dry days, amazing winding roads and a huge culture of other bikers to ride with.

The reason I like Palo Alto & Menlo Park is that they feel like cities without tall buildings. There are tons of services and quite a large number of people from surprisingly diverse backgrounds. And I LOVE biking places. We also have an amazing surfeit of public parks which makes it fun to be a kid here. I am not a particularly outdoorsy person.

Many families I know who are ""outdoorsy"" have actually moved away. I know a family that moved to Olympia, WA. Many families have moved to the Truckee area. Others have moved to places like Seattle, or New Mexico.

I know many people who live in places like Half Moon Bay or La Honda, which are much more ""in the woods"" and they commute down the hill. They end up spending a lot of time in their cars.

Palo Alto has a lot to offer, but I think when it comes to outdoor adventure, I think you will definitely feel like it is a downgrade from Utah. Think of it more like a city that happens to have some opportunities for people who need a taste of the outdoors.",t2_zhed2,doctorboredom,0,1638772684.0,0,t1_hnfiyxv,hnfiyxv,True,playerbarisax,t3_r9kw54,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/r9kw54/might_move_to_the_area_for_a_job_looking_for/,Might move to the area for a job.

"I also moved into PA recently and think a lot of your usage depends on the type of heater you have.  Central heat will cost you more, etc. (I'm sure you know that).  My heater is a standalone in the living room which is basically a gas waster.  Hot water is included so I don't pay to heat it.  The first month when I left the pilot on (without ever turning the thermostat on) I used 2 therms.  Cost me about $16.  Now with winter rates (higher) I turned the pilot off and use electric space heaters.  Not sure if you pay for sewage also ($45 to flush a toilet a few times a day) but that is my highest utility expense.  Actual electric usage runs me about $20/month winter or summer (in the summer I was using as much fan action as I'm using space heaters in winter).  My total bill is about $75 with all the usage fees.  Yup, $75 to flush a toilet 3x a day and run a few lights, a space heater occasionally and a modem that runs 24/7.

"Take this with a grain of salt, but my friend always said that CPA utilities is able to buy power for residents as a group. They are able to buy power at lower rates and pass the savings on to customers. As u/rpjr90 says, maybe these cost savings actually come from underpaying linemen.

Maybe another way of looking at it is that CPA is beholden to resident voters, so they keep rates lower than PG&E does, who generally seek to pass on costs to ratepayers.

One of the interesting side effects is that lower electricity costs create less of an incentive to install solar, since there is less cost to offset through net metering.",t2_1tv5o,stick_figure,0,1637182129.0,0,t1_hl197ni,hl197ni,True,[deleted],t3_qvuac3,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/qvuac3/what_is_the_actual_difference_between_palo_alto/,What is the actual difference between Palo Alto Utilities & PG&E?,/r/paloalto/comments/qvuac3/what_is_the_actual_difference_between_palo_alto/hl197ni/,3,r/paloalto,0,3

That sad thing I saw was that the linemen that worked for CPA utilities are totally under paid to the rest if the market. PG&E pays much more and that’s why it’s hard for municipal utilities like Palo Alto to hire and keep good linemen. Less pay for better service (and pg&e benefits are better).

"Nice bus, a step up from regular municipal lines, more like a Greyhound, with nicely upholstered seats and wifi and semi-white-collar passengers. But you wouldn't be going very far anyway. It's meant for people who cross the Bay but a ""local"" pass is [cheaper](https://dumbartonexpress.com/db_fares/), and there might be either a tax benefit or subsidy from your employer (normally yes but for an internship idk). Make sure the [schedule](https://dumbartonexpress.com/line-db1-schedule/) works for you, i.e. you don't need it super early or super late or on weekends.

The ""peak hours"" route of the [VTA 89](https://www.vta.org/go/routes/89) also gets you pretty close to Tesla HQ, but it's a short route that only goes through the research park to the California Ave Caltrain station. Of course you could always live somewhere else on the Caltrain line and transfer to the 89, but then you're talking about a much more frustrating and expensive commute.

You could also live all the way over on the East Bay and take the same DB1 from there with the trans-Bay fare. Possibly more affordable than EPA, not sure. The California Ave neighborhood where you could catch the 89 is very nice and would probably be the ideal place to live with your commute, but I'm not sure it works on intern pay. Consider also the [101/102/103 from the South Bay or 104 from Milpitas?](https://www.vta.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/VTA_MainMap_101121.pdf).

I've been golfing since I was a child and I've made most of my golf friends off the course just by talking about golf while walking my dogs. 

A bit of a warning, golf is addictive and can get expensive real fast.

"What the video doesn't show, is the ""biker"" riding back & forth down the University Ave pedestrian area, zig-zagging between pedestrians at unsafe speed. He uses his bike as a unicycle, but doing a wheelie with the front fork hanging out in front.

I've been nearly hit by this guy. He's reckless & unsafe. The downtown streets are clearly marked pedestrian only (even regular bikes are not allowed). Adding more context, the biker does this for hours for fun apparently trying to put a show on while risking those around him.

Am risking my karma but don't care. Am not sure what the law says, but going 10mph on a pedestrian-only (marked) sidewalk, between pedestrians, with the split metal fork hanging out at upper-body to head level (lots of kids around this area), is simply unacceptable & unsafe behavior.

"This is hard to answer without knowing your diet, food choices, etc. Are we talking steak 5 nights a week or ramen? Whole Foods or Safeway? Do you eat a ton, or are you a light eater?

"I comment on this concern often.  Asbestos containing transite piping is highly durable and used for a variety of potable water, drainage and sewer lines. It will break if impacted but otherwise can last for decades particularly if it's not baking for years in the hot sun before installation.  The interior of the pipe is smooth and manufactured in a way to minimize any fibre release. If the pipe is maintained in good condition, there is low risk of exposure drinking any potable water transported through it.  The pipe infrastructure throughout North America will eventually be fully abated and replaced with modern piping.  Stay safe.

"I’m so late to the party but had to chip in being the vain being I am! 

Do not live in a basement apartment. (Which I see you’ve made the choice) I’ve lived in two temporarily and will never do so again unless I need to.

Pros: it’s cheaper (basement could save at least $200-$300 a month just in rent compared to a 1 Bd. That’s thousands of dollars a year). 

-Basements are also generally a couple degrees more cooler in the summer which I liked - So if the house is set at 73, it’ll be 71 in the basement. This is important because most basement apartments don’t have a separate HVAC thermostat. Even in apartments I’ve felt hot in my bedroom and needed a fan with the air on, but never in a basement. 

Cons: the noise, oh god the noise! If you have different schedules from the landlord or family or other tenants above you, god help you. You can hear footsteps, thumping, banging, talking, dogs barking (if they have one) etc. it was horrible. Some basement soundproofing are worse than others, so if you can, definitely investigate and test it out. Some people could hear their landlords phone vibrate or anytime the opened/closed the fridge. I made sure that that I was renting from two single ladies over 50. An even then it was still bad. Just make sure it’s not a family with a toddler. It’s Horrible. I’m telling you. 

Another big con is the natural light situation which is nearly nonexistent. Both my basements had no windows and only one patio door to open that didn’t bring much natural light and helped only a little for fresh air. And if there was no sun during the day I’d have to turn on all the lights as if it was nighttime already. Could be very depressing sometimes.

Could be humid sometimes if you are in a humid area which would be unpleasant. A dehumidifier can go a long way. 

Smell lingers a longtime especially due to poor ventilation, so cooking eggs and bacon could even be unpleasant and can get very smokey. 

High risk of more damage due to possible flooding; even minor dampness could cause problems. 

Higher risk of pests breaking into home through the basement first as it is the first level of entry for ground animals.

"UPDATE - Garnet has found her new forever home. Thank you all! If you are still looking to bring a pet into your family, Pets in Need has many more animals looking for homes :)

&#x200B;

We have been fostering the loveliest dog for four months now, and would love for her to find her forever home - you may have seen us on walks around Kite Hill or throughout the neighborhood. Garnet is a 42 lb German Shepherd mix. She's six years old and perfectly trained (she knows sit, stay, shake, down, and more!) She is well behaved on leash, and never pulls even when excited to grunt at the local squirrels. She's the absolute best walking, running, hiking, and exploring partner; we've taken her on some serious mountain hikes (7-8 miles) and as long as we keep her well hydrated she keeps on trucking along. She also is totally content to just snooze with you on the couch all day - with or without a long walk beforehand. Also, if you love road trips, she's the perfect dog for you. She absolutely loves car rides (10 mins to 10 hours!): she falls asleep and never once has gotten sick, she tries to get in the car every time we walk out the door. She has no issues at all with separation anxiety - just hops on the couch and snoozes until we're back home.

Our favorite 3 things she does:

1. greets us with her favorite toy every time we come through the door
2. sniffs along the grass like a metal detector, you gotta see it...
3. hides her Dingo treats in the funniest places (read: plain view) but thinks we don't know where she stashed them to enjoy later.

She does like to keep her distance from other dogs - she sometimes barks back when provoked but as long as we keep moving away, she quickly settles back into her normal content self.

For strangers in the house, she is barky and jumpy, but we have successfully acquainted her with two people who she now knows and loves just as much as she loves us. Outside on walks, she is totally fine passing other humans, unless they try to pet her, then she barks to show that she wants to keep social distancing :)

Here's her profile on Pets-In-Need [https://www.petsinneed.org/dogs/garnet](https://www.petsinneed.org/dogs/garnet). Her skin condition is nearly completely healed, we haven't had to do anything for the last 3 months.

"Hi, my name is Palo (you can call me Pal for short) and I am a 3 year old Husky-German Shepherd mix that weighs around 60 pounds. My foster dad tells me that all of his friends, and many strangers, tell him that I am one of the most handsome dogs that they have ever seen. I am flattered! I am very friendly with all humans, large and small! I am very energetic and love to spend my time smiling, playing with toys, and eating chicken jerky. I also love to go on walks and runs, and chase birds and squirrels. I have learned never to go potty inside. Above all, I love my human and I am a very loyal dog.

Unfortunately, life has not always been easy for me. I spent some time living on the streets in Modesto before I was found by the shelter where my foster dad rescued me. I became malnourished, a bit anxious, and weary of other male dogs during my time on the streets. My foster dad has been feeding me lots of kibble, canned food, and chicken jerky, so I am healthy and fully nourished again. I am in professional training to deal with my anxiety and barking behaviors at other dogs, and I have made a lot of progress!

Palo is microchipped, neutered, and completely up to date on his shots. Although he can display aggressive behaviors towards other dogs (however, during his time with his foster dad, he has never attacked or made harmful contact with another dog), he can warm up to other dogs when introduced calmly and over time. In fact, he has several pup friends that he loves to play with often. As mentioned above, he is in professional training, and he is already completely trained for an invisible fence.",t2_1g0q9wfz,greenoctopusink,0,1626202470.0,0,t1_h52g6mo,h52g6mo,True,[deleted],t3_ojm86j,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/ojm86j/this_handsome_huskygerman_shepherd_mix_needs_a/,This handsome Husky-German Shepherd mix needs a furrever home!,/r/paloalto/comments/ojm86j/this_handsome_huskygerman_shepherd_mix_needs_a/h52g6mo/,3,r/paloalto,0,3

"I've lived Palo Alto since the 80s and I would not describe Palo Alto as college town feel. It was a little bit more college-town like in the 80s but that's another era.

It's silicon-valley upscale through and through. The downtown is full of upscale and mid-scale restaurants.  The dining scene is excellent if that's what you want.  You won't find dive bars anymore, the last (Antonio Nut House) closed its doors last year.  The nearest thing is the Dutch Goose in Menlo Park. Even the historic dive bar (Rosotti's Alpine Inn) went upscale ""rustic"".

The downtown and Stanford mall are very upscale. The parkng lots are full of Teslas and foreign high-end SUVs.

"The SF to Palo Alto commute, by car, is a life-ruiner. I've known lots of people who regretted living in SF despite all the amenities and decided to move homes or change jobs because of it. Don't make that plan A.

It might work if you look for other options like a company bus or Caltrain (hopefully company-subsidized or at least you can take a tax deduction). Depending on traffic those might not even be any slower, but more importantly it's time you get to spend reading or working or streaming instead of sitting in traffic and cultivating hatred of your fellow citizen.

Or there are plenty of cute walkable fun mini-downtowns up and down the Peninsula, generally near Caltrain stops, including Palo Alto itself. Maybe you could start there until you get the lay of the land? You can still go to the city in the evenings and weekends when traffic is less catastrophic.

"Have you checked with the [Stanford Housing Office](https://fsh.stanford.edu/)? Can you get into Stanford West? It's across the street (Sand Hill Rd) from the hospital. Stanford Hospital is just 2 miles from Mia - a 10 minute bike ride or half hour walk. Mariposa is a little farther - 2.4 miles - but the free Marguerite shuttle can cut that in half. A bicycle is definitely the fastest way to get around here.

Commuter train electrification is supposed to happen in 2022 which will quiet things and clear the air. But trains are required to blow long-long-short-long when approaching a grade crossing, and all of Mariposa is close to the Churchill grade crossing. That crossing will probably be closed off in the future, but not in a fellowship timeframe.

Does the cottage have a nice outdoor space? Mia is an elevator building, boxes with balconies facing northeast or southwest. I believe that Stanford now has on-campus housing for all undergraduates and most grad students, so you won't find many undergraduates there.

There are quite a few for-rent signs out now. I think one of the nicest rental neighborhoods near here is along Waverley in Menlo Park (between Linfield and Laurel) but many of those places are advertised only with a sign on the lawn.",t2_9mc7y,jds013,0,1622244871.0,0,t1_gztf5ou,gztf5ou,True,hauterorni,t3_nn0fkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/nn0fkr/mia_apartment_vs_private_cottage/,Mia apartment vs private cottage,/r/paloalto/comments/nn0fkr/mia_apartment_vs_private_cottage/gztf5ou/,3,r/paloalto,0,3

"I used to work at the VA, I live in Palo Alto but only because I inherited a house here. There is free parking at the hospital but you should be aware of traffic. Go on zillow and try to find some apartments/houses you will be able to afford and use google maps to figure out how bad the traffic is at the times you will be commuting. Just keep in mind that it might be a little higher once everything is fully reopened.

If you don't want to drive, your best bet is to take Caltrain. You should find somewhere to live that is near a Caltrain station and take the train to the California Ave station, then take the VTA 89 bus to the hospital. Note that if you get a Caltrain monthly pass that is 2 zones or higher you can transfer to the VTA bus for free. 

Also, ask the VA if they will subsidize your transit costs. They didn't do this when I was there but they might now. Most of the transit agencies around here use clipper cards, so make sure that any transit you plan to take will accept the card and make sure that the VA adds all the transit agencies you'll need to use to your card.",t2_4rfeygp9,mokiboki,0,1621533581.0,0,t1_gyuldcy,gyuldcy,True,Careful-Swimming-322,t3_nh1u4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/nh1u4b/people_that_work_full_time_at_palo_alto_what_area/,People that work full time at Palo Alto- what area do you live in??,/r/paloalto/comments/nh1u4b/people_that_work_full_time_at_palo_alto_what_area/gyuldcy/,3,r/paloalto,0,3

">  From what I’ve read, its typical that people live close to work and just bike or take the train to work, is it mainly for convenience? Or is it because you have to pay for parking and too much traffic commuting the area?

Well, it's also typical to drive, possibly even from far away, but for those who don't it's largely the second reason. This area is strangled by too much car traffic and not enough infrastructure, in normal times, and local employers and workers try hard to find alternatives. I don't know the numbers but I'm guessing the VA charges you for a parking permit and subsidizes your transit passes. The problem is our transit system is kind of a disconnected hodgepodge so you have to choose your location strategically to use it for commuting, but if you can make that work it's probably a lot nicer than sitting in traffic every day angry at all the other people who made the same choice.

The VA is up in some hills, so biking can be a little bit of a workout depending on which direction you come from, and it's surrounded on most sides by a big business park rather than housing. However, it's served by a few VTA buses, including one that goes directly to the California Ave Caltrain station, from which you can connect to the rest of the Peninsula (if you happen to live near a station, which requires more strategic planning, plus Caltrain is expensive). It's also a stop for one of the Dumbarton Express routes, so you could even take a nice comfy bus from the other side of the Bay.

I would start by either looking for housing in the Barron Park/Green Acres areas or checking which transit passes are subsidized by your employer. If you want to live in a walkable downtown, the California Ave neighborhood is nice and you have a direct bus route (or somewhat intense bike workout) from there.",t2_31wm44k1,throwaway9834712935,0,1621522513.0,0,t1_gytuxq7,gytuxq7,True,Careful-Swimming-322,t3_nh1u4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/nh1u4b/people_that_work_full_time_at_palo_alto_what_area/,People that work full time at Palo Alto- what area do you live in??,/r/paloalto/comments/nh1u4b/people_that_work_full_time_at_palo_alto_what_area/gytuxq7/,5,r/paloalto,0,5

Basements are quite common in new construction because land is very expensive and the owner is limited in how much square footage they can build above ground as a fraction of property size but basements do not count against that.  If it's recent construction then I'd expect a basement room to be quite nice.  *BUT* older homes often had a small unfinished basement to house utility stuff like a furnace.  If an owner has done a quick and dirty remodel to finish the space then it could be as bad as you're imagining.  So it could go either way.  The comment about fire egress is right on point.

"> Wow that's an essay! Thanks so much!

No worries, moving across country is hard and stressful, it's hard to know what an area or neighborhood is like.  Palo Alto will always hold a very special place in my heart.  Pretty much all the best things that happened in my life happened there.  I met my wife there, I participated in several tech startups and made some money, I had so much fun.  I hope you enjoy it.

After you have been there a year, you'll develop your own opinions, but I want to reassure you that the weather is wonderful, the area is very nice and has a lot to offer (especially in non-pandemic years).  You can get to San Francisco in 30 minutes, you can get to the ocean beaches and ocean front towns in 45 minutes, you can get to skiing in 4 hours if you don't get stuck in traffic.  There are both nature and city experiences all available to you, many are COMPLETELY free like if you want to walk across the Golden Gate bridge some Saturday, or take a hike to ""Land's End"", or just walk down the street window shopping in Urban San Francisco.  

The biggest down side (of course) is the area is very expensive to rent or buy in.  But if it is within your budget it really has a lot to offer.",t2_3m2w4,brianwski,0,1619402341.0,0,t1_gvvujop,gvvujop,False,BleakAsHalogen,t3_mwi5vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/paloalto/comments/mwi5vy/apartment_hunting_process_tips/,Apartment Hunting Process + Tips,/r/paloalto/comments/mwi5vy/apartment_hunting_process_tips/gvvujop/,2,r/paloalto,0,2
