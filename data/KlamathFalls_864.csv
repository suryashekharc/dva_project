"Hey so I run the board game night at the library and this thread was brought to my attention last night! (Had no idea there was a kfalls subreddit. Hey, y'all.)  


So other folks in the thread have covered most of the details, but to reiterate: we meet the first and third Tuesdays of the month from 5:30 to when library closes at 8. Including me, we usually get between 5-10 players a night, which splits up nicely into two tables for 3-5 players, or one big game.  


Games we play usually rate under 2.3 or so on BoardGameGeek's complexity scale - stuff like Clank, 7 Wonders, original-flavor Pandemic or Betrayal at House on the Hill is usually about as heavy as games get. (Between the full table of folks not getting here until 6ish and having to re-teach the rules, it doesn't leave a whole lot of time for a full game. That said, if you have a group you know can show up around 5:15-5:30 and get right to it on a beefy game, go nuts.)  


It's good to bring a range of stuff you can teach other folks - 15-60 min, 3-6 player range is really the sweet spot. (And I'm always looking for short, low-stakes games to play while we're waiting for people to arrive or to wind down the night. I love Tsuro, Fluxx, and Sushi Go, but I feel like there's a lot more out there.)  


But yeah, best way you can communicate to the library that you want more of this kind of thing is to be a regular at board game night! We absolutely use attendance and feedback to develop library events.",t2_3qdj7pt0,NacFayden,0,1646246723.0,0,t1_hz2zdp2,hz2zdp2,True,PrinceMarvelOz,t3_sihrai,https://www.reddit.com/r/KlamathFalls/comments/sihrai/library_adult_board_game_night/,Library Adult Board Game Night,/r/KlamathFalls/comments/sihrai/library_adult_board_game_night/hz2zdp2/,2,r/KlamathFalls,0,2

"Challenge accepted!

I'll set up an interview with the Chamber this week. If you would, please help me with some questions I can ask them before joining. I'll see if I can get a Friday appointment so we have all week to work out the list of questions! I'm excited to see where this goes!!! :)

Capitalism and a business owners intention are not synonymous. ""Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit."" Business owners who understand micro/macro economics from this perspective know it's in their best interest to spend their money locally. I think you would be surprised at how many abide by this practice. This isn't always possible because not all things are available locally. I believe we should encourage and support a local resident in filling that void before we support an international conglomerate moving into town. Also, Dick Wendt was one of the most altruistic people I'd ever met, and one of the most successful business men as well. He is a prime counter for your pessimistic perspective and a role model I aspire to be like.

To your point, there is nothing wrong with Walmart undercutting prices from a pure capitalistic perspective. Their quality and our community are the sacrifices. While it may be cheaper to purchase an item, if it doesn't last the only thing you're saving is the up front cost. Ultimately the buyer ends up spending more money. (see the trick here?) This is getting into the one time use culture though, which I'd prefer to save for another conversation. My focus so far has been on the giving back to the community and the recycling of money within a community because of the proven benefits.

Don't just take my word for it. Let's look at one study on the subject. THIS STUDY was conducted by the firm Civic Economics ([http://www.civiceconomics.com](http://www.civiceconomics.com)) in the Chicago land area.

""Trading independent retailers for big-box chains weakens the local economy. This is because local stores recycle a much larger share of their sales revenue back into the local economy, while chains siphon most of the dollars spent at their stores out of the community, funneling them back to corporate headquarters or to distant suppliers.

The added economic benefit of local stores has been dubbed the ""local premium."" Several studies have quantified it. One was conducted in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood by the firm Civic Economics. The study analyzed ten locally owned restaurants, retail stores, and service providers and compared them with ten national chains competing in the same

categories. The study found that spending $100 at one of the neighborhood's independent businesses created $68 in additional local economic activity, while spending $100 at a chain produced only $43 worth of local impact.

The difference was due to four factors:

**Local Payroll**—The locally owned businesses spent a larger share of their revenue on local labor (29 vs. 23 percent), because they carried out all management functions on-site, rather than at corporate headquarters.

**Procurement**—The local retailers spent more than twice as much buying goods and services from other local businesses. They banked locally; hired local accountants, attorneys, designers, and other professionals; advertised in local media; and sourced inventory from local firms.

**Profits**—Because their owners live in the area, a larger portion of the local retailers’ profits stayed within the local economy.

**Charitable giving**—The local retailers donated more on average to local charities and community organizations than the chains did.

Added dollars circulating in the local economy translate into a larger number and wider variety of available jobs. The implications of the local premium for how cities approach economic development are significant. Not only do big-box stores eliminate more retail jobs than they create (see our fact-sheet, Impact of BigBox Stores on Existing Jobs), but they reduce local economic activity and job creation in other sectors. Conversely, expanding local businesses generates substantially greater economic benefits.""

So I guess it begins with whether or not an individual cares more about cheap disposable products, or their community.  Or, perhaps that's not a fair way to word it. Another perspective is if one believes the trade off for cheap Chinese products outweigh the economic loss endured from the introduction of a Walmart (Foreign Entity vs. Local).",t2_9sz5c0ox,Jasper620042,0,1641777124.0,0,t1_hrzw9id,hrzw9id,False,Jasper620042,t3_rhq73i,https://www.reddit.com/r/KlamathFalls/comments/rhq73i/wtf_happened_to_klamath/,WTF happened to Klamath?,/r/KlamathFalls/comments/rhq73i/wtf_happened_to_klamath/hrzw9id/,2,r/KlamathFalls,0,2

One of them was Thai. Gosh I guess that gives it away. None of the entrees were Thai food. They were some of the ingredients sub par as they were that made up the Thai dishes but ketchup on noodles does not make spaghetti. 

The other was Mexican. It was a horrendous outright false representation of a dish I know well and served by Mexicans no less. Also meat presented as carne asada was more akin to an over cooked two day old pot roast and tasted like such.

"Cali immigrant here 6 months. I’m not a redneck nor the opposite 🤔. Wife spent a few years here as a kid, we were wanting to leave Cali anyways when our house skyrocketed in value and we took a trip here to investigate. I fell in love and quite frankly made a hasty decision and put an offer in on our home without thinking it through. 

All I saw was I could get 4x a better home for 35% the price of SoCal and I work from and spend a lot of time at home anyways. The lack of COVID enforced restrictions was also a huge selling point. The people wowed me with their friendliness. We could and did sell our California shithole profiting enough to pay cash for this much nicer home (we didn’t). 

I did not live the Cali lifestyle but I paid for it. I got sick of the homelessness, lack of law enforcement, anti American sentiment, and extreme high cost of living. I also wanted my kids to grow up in a more wholesome environment. No money can insulate you from the social ills of the city I lived in. Here I feel more insulated and safer.

"There's nothing bad or wrong with the chambers of commerce trying to get people to buy local or otherwise banding together for mutual support for a common cause. Just like there's nothing wrong with Walmart undercutting the local businesses. It's all capitalism at work. Everyone's in competition with one another.

I know what their intentions are because I know how capitalism works. Yes there will be some local business owners that buy local themselves as much as possible and altruistically. The more successful local business owners didn't get that way by being so altruistic. They might buy some things local for appearances though. A big chunk of their income from their business will be invested in large corporations including Walmart. If/when you join the Chamber you can ask them yourself where they invest for retirement.

Yes wages are affected by many things. The most successful business owners treat it purely as an expense that should always be as small as possible. When the job market is smaller they lower wages or limit raises; the workers can take it or leave it. That's why a minimum wage that's indexed to inflation is so important. The presence of Walmart expands the job market and so raises wages. Considering that Walmart gives free college degrees they likely offer the most valuable low skill jobs in K Falls.

"It sounds like you have a different perspective of the Chamber of Commerce than most others. As a new local business owner, I've been seriously considering joining the Chamber. I'm very much interested in more of your opinion before hand as there may be something you can share that I'm not yet aware of.  


I'm not a ""well-off"" business owner, so I don't want to get in with the wrong crowd right from the start. After all, If I join the chamber and they do what you say they're going to do... and help promote my business... so that my business can make more profit... I might become one of those evil ""well-off"" folks you're hating on right now. But only if I work my ass off and make a lot of personal sacrifices to get there. The harder I work, the more reasons I give you to hate it seems.  


Seriously, did you re-read your first paragraph above???  


""It's the chambers of commerce, an organization of local businesses that make more profit the more that people buy local.""  ------ Yes it is.  Community businesses got together and created an organization to mutually benefit it's members. Kind of sounds like other organizations you might be able to think of. Are they all bad? Is it the concept of mutual support for a common cause that you disagree with? I'm sincerely curious.   


""They have no intention of redistributing that extra money back into the community."" ---------- How do you know what their intentions are? This statement is you projecting your biases on others. I always shop local first. I make more purchases at Merrill & Malin hardware stores and Diamond's than I do Home Depot. That money I spend there goes to my neighbors who own those businesses. Most all of the local business owners I interact with feel the same.  


""They won't buy local themselves or pay their employees more, because they're businesses not charities."" -------- Again, what supports this statement?  How do you know what local business owners spending practices are? Claiming you do is plain idiocy.   


Employment wages are primarily market driven by Labor Pool and local cost of living (economics). Proof in point, the service industry is currently lacking labor supply, so the market has forced wage increases. Politics and goodwill combined doesn't make it happen as quickly as a labor shortage will.   


Cost of living in an area also dictates wages. The higher the cost of living the higher the need for wages. Sadly this metric is always trailing where it should be.

"> Pay attention to who writes the articles.

Yes. Who writes the ""buy local"" articles? It's the chambers of commerce, an organization of local businesses that make more profit the more that people buy local. They have no intention of redistributing that extra money back into the community. They won't buy local themselves or pay their employees more, because they're businesses not charities.

Re your link, I can already believe that Walmart isn't sustainable and in many ways is an awful corporation. But like it or not we live in a capitalistic society where we're all competing with one another. When you pay more for the same goods you're just hurting yourself.

I suggest you treat ""buy local"" as a gift to others including well-off business owners. Don't expect a penny in return ever in the future. You could focus your gifts where the goods are way better.

"I'm not only a Freight Broker, but I also own a trucking company. I'm up to my eyeballs in the transportation world. I have customers here in the basin as well as around the world. The things I ship range from Oyster Shell Flour to 200,000+ lbs construction machines to a single loom. If it needs to get from point A to point B, I and my team will make it happen. I'm currently working on breaking into space transportation, but that filed is super niche and the current players won't let any new kids join the party...yet. :)  


Since my return to the basin I've been networking extensively while I familiarize myself with the community pulse. I'm still learning and greatly appreciate your discourse and points.  
\------------

There is a Gypsum plant I ship out of periodically around the Sulphurdale, UT. I absolutely hate getting those shipments because of the difficulty in getting them covered. I almost always have to pay a truck to dead head (drive empty) from SLC even though the pickup location is near a major interstate junction. The problem they have in Sulpherdale is that there isn't much of a reason for people to stop...or build. So most all of the traffic is just passthrough. From a shipping perspective, that means things are much more expensive to ship in/out of that area because of the lack of shipments in/out of the same vicinity. This is true even though there are thousands of trucks passing that area.  


Klamath is the same way. It has a lot of passthrough traffic. I have shipments in the Basin that I have to pay trucks to dead head in to pickup. They come from as far away as Reno, Sacramento, Portland, Bend, Seattle, even Boise. Even when paying for the deadhead miles, most of the trucks decline the load because of where we are. It's a risk for a truck driver to deadhead here and potentially have the load dropped on them. That means they lose out on the fuel and time getting here and there are very few, if any loads they could recover with. So they would have to deadhead out as well to find anything worthwhile. Truck traffic here will increase when there are more things shipping out than in.   


In addition to the transportation world, I also sit on the board of an out of state non-profit that focuses on job training for felons, veterans, and others in addition to general community support. Through this organization and a future potential partnership with Klamath Works and other local like veined entities, job training and job placement is going to get easier. The labor is here, it just needs to be trained and treated properly.   


Money/Investors isn't an issue. I know for many people it is, but I've been fortunate enough to have figured out how to make this obstacle not and obstacle. For example: I have a customer I ship for who is, among other things, an international commodity importer. One of the other things he's ties up in is Pumice. He used to own a pumice mine many years ago and was BFF's w/ Dick Wynne. Dick and he worked on various uses of Pumice at the Jeld-Wyn R&D facility. One of the things they came up with was a product similar to Hardieboard or other types of backer boards, and maybe dry wall. Dick passed and my customer became very ill for many years (unrelated events). The combination of the two stopped the project(s) and continued development.   


This guy and his network have the financial resources to build whatever kind of facility is necessary to build to manufacture these products. The catch is that they never got far enough to have a final formula, just a ton of research data. Last month he told me if I can find a chemist and engineer who can put all the data together, finish the formula work and finalize a finished product process, he would continue supporting the advancement of this project and help to ensure its creation. This is an example of investors willing to invest here and an industry that is ripe for Klamath. The resources to manufacture this kind of product would come from two primary locations, Beaver Pumice in Klamath County (a local business) and the resins would come from SunPol Resins in Farifield, CA (owned by basin folks), while the manufacturing would be done here.) This is a huge undertaking that I don't' have time to focus on at the moment. Perhaps in the near future this might become more of a reality.  


There is another development project in Klamath I am currently supporting that's creating 3D printed panel pieces to make shipping containers into housing. It's a neat project that scans and custom prints plastic panel pieces that will fit on the external of a shipping container so as to leave more livable space on the inside. This is still in the R&D phase, but has great potential for local job creation down the road, not to mention more affordable low income or emergency housing.   


The difference in manufacturing between these two examples is pretty stark. Both are potential manufacturing options for the Basin. There are many other examples I could give as well If I wanted to continue writing this novel. The airport is another in depth conversation for another time. The rail road options are really good here. The government (incentives, regulations, restrictions, taxes, etc.) is what it is. This interaction can be worked with, changed, and/or removed as necessary. I think the biggest hurdle there is going to be communication. We can make local level changes that will counteract the negative obstacles created by the State that make those other places more appealing, like Texas and Florida.

"I'm aware of that ""buy local"" reasoning. I don't believe it. Economies are obviously stronger the more interconnected with the rest of the world they are. Most people benefit from the greater competition. K Falls can offset money leaving to the pet store's HQ by selling to the world, including the labor of online workers. The citizens can invest in companies regardless of their location.

Suppose everyone in K Falls bought and worked local, and the big box stores closed. The local who makes the leashes might lower their quality now that there's less competition. They might sell them to the Ledge for a higher price. The Ledge might add their own increase to make the price of the leash $40. They might take advantage of the smaller job market to lower wages or not give raises. (Like any business they want to maximize revenue and minimize expenses.) These are the kind of subtle consequences that the studies you refer to can easily miss. The customer who pays an extra $15 ($40 instead of $25, say) for the leash likely won't get that back somehow. More likely they won't recoup any of that $15 and fall further behind due to a lower wage.",t2_16ug4k,wupdup,0,1640922260.0,0,t1_hqn03rt,hqn03rt,False,Jasper620042,t3_rhq73i,https://www.reddit.com/r/KlamathFalls/comments/rhq73i/wtf_happened_to_klamath/,WTF happened to Klamath?,/r/KlamathFalls/comments/rhq73i/wtf_happened_to_klamath/hqn03rt/,1,r/KlamathFalls,0,1
"I'm not an economist so obviously this should all be taken with a freight train's worth of salt (and let's be honest that is sort of true of economists as well) but...

This depends on the manufacturing in question and it seems like you are referring at first to nondurable consumer goods which are the focus of ""buy local"" campaigns. That kind of thing is going to be a lot easier to grow to the point that it can expand to a regional level in Portland (and even Medford with a metro area including 280,000 people) than Klamath Falls. Klamath Falls arguably had a recent major failure at this level with something that could potentially have made it to a wider market with Klamath Basin Brewing.

As for other manufacturing, the mere potential for returning to ""local production"" doesn't overcome local factors like incentives, the tax environment, the effects of (lack of) concentration, etc. in a competitive environment. If you're a corporation, you're probably looking at Texas, North Carolina, etc. and if you're looking at Oregon, Klamath Falls is just not going to be at the top and not necessarily even because of negative local factors (although there are negative factors).

There are hypothetical advantages (e.g. rail access with competition between UP/BNSF; AFAIK there is a hot mix asphalt plant; U.S. 97 is a decent trucking route but based on your profile I'd be interested in your thoughts; OIT; not necessarily horrible land costs) and then there are some notable disadvantages (the airport simply can't sustain commercial service in the current airline climate unless it offered subsidies that would instantly bankrupt the city; bad demographics) and so your appeal ends up being aimed at the kinds of industry that have already concentrated or moved elsewhere.

Klamath Falls could be a great place with industry but I honestly don't see how you sell it to investors who are almost certainly unfamiliar with it on it unless you get a steal of a deal or have really niche needs. Alternatively, if you are starting locally with consumer goods, I think it'd be hard to out compete others in the region if you start in Klamath Falls.

You have a freight broker background (?) so I'm curious what specific industries you think have a potential competitive advantage in Klamath Falls at least in regards to that.

"I greatly disagree about Walmart. The cheaper crap they sell does on the surface appear to be a benefit for low income folks. HOWEVER, studies have shown that the cheaper cost of products they offer is not enough of a benefit for a community to counter act the benefits of a locally owned business where the owners live in or near the community they serve. On the contrary, it does more harm than good.   


The reason boils down to money flow. When people give their money to Walmart for those cheap products, and that money leaves the community. Which means we as a community have to work harder to create more wealth in that area. We essentially begin living like surfs.   


Whereas the money we spend at a local business (lets use the Ledge for example) gets reinvested in the community. When the ledge takes my money for his products, that money stays with him and he spends the majority of someplace in the community. For example, a few days ago I bought a dog leash at the Ledge for $30. It was made in Oregon by a local resident. An hour later I was at the pet store at the old Jefferson Square mall where they also had dog leashes, but for half, and even 75% less cost.  


The breakdown between the two is like this...  


The pet store purchase saves me money, yes. But that money then leaves the K Falls and goes to wherever the pet store's HQ is located. That location gets the businesses profits. That big business pays big bonuses to the higher ups (none who live in Klamath and will likely never visit or spend a single cent here.) If it's a publicly traded company it might pay dividends to it's share holders who the majority also don't reside locally. Regardless, the important point is when the money leaves the basin. The overall money supply in the basin is weakened each time we spend out dollars someplace that sends that money out. Which means the poor get more poor and everyone has to work harder to keep cash flow here.  


That $30 I spent at the Ledge will remain within the community. He'll spend it at a local gas station, or grocery store, or other local retails shops. If those local businesses also do the same, that money stays in the community and is continuously recycled and grows. Those same dollars can be used over and over for continual growth. The locals don't have to work as hard to bring in money from outside to replace it. This creates a money supply issue. Less money = higher prices. It's a type of inflation...or reverse inflation, depending on which perspective your approaching it from.   


Spending money is a mindset. Why and How you spend money has been the target of marketeer's for a really long time. Most people don't understand this concept or how it effects them.

"I have to disagree with the community building manufacturing. Of all the places I've been, Oregon is by far the best example of a community on a large scale focusing on local businesses.  Check out the airports as an example. Both Medford and Portland have local businesses filling their local business filing their locations. A great many of the Oregon based (mostly locally owned) businesses are really keen on stocking products made in Oregon, even more so if made locally to the business. All other things aside, that aspect of our State alone is pretty unique.   


The international corporate sales model has been tried, worked well for about 4 decades, and now is failing...or at the very least showing it's vulnerability. The current shipping disaster we're experiencing is going to alter that forever.

"I think the success of small towns in the 21st century is not going to be based on industrial jobs as it was 20-60 years ago. This is due to the fact that supply chains are global now and automation is taking over manufacturing rapidly. So trying to solve the towns problems by attracting more industrial jobs just doesn't make sense. 

The marker for success in small towns in the future will be their quality of life. Currently 25% of the population works remote. That means, that for 50 million people, as long as you have high speed internet you can work from anywhere.  So people now get to choose where they live without a tether to a certain location. 

By focusing on quality fo life factors such as parks, trails, local cultural scenes, events, etc. small towns and Klamath in particular can easily attract remote workers from cities due to their lower cost of living, slower pace of life and access to the outdoors. Also people in Klamath seem to not notice that it has one of the nicest climates in the country and is right next to the mountains two things that small towns in places like Nebraska and Michigan will never have.

With remote workers you get the opposite affect of Walmart/Amazon. People are paid by companies located in cities and then spend their money in town which in turn supports local businesses, restaurants, tradesmen, taxes etc. This functionally acts as a major and prolonged injection of outside capital into  the town.

"As a landlord for 20+ years, I have a clause in my contracts about not smoking in the house. I do specifically state ""Tobacco"" and not Cannabis. Tobacco smoke destroys! It stains the surfaces it touches and leaves a smell that can never get out without replacing the wall material. (Paint cover ups don't always work. Tobacco's is strong enough to seep through) THAT smell and staining is the reason for the rule. Obviously people don't follow it, but when I catch them I make life as miserable for them as they make it for me in damaging my property. And it's not hard to know if tobacco is being burned in an enclosed room.  


I've won multiple situations against tenants who smoke in my units ranging from eviction, to monetary penalties to physical labor repainting or even replacing damaged material. One tenant had to replace my bathroom vanity, repaint the room and replace the drywall sections in the ceiling above the sink because he kept letting cigarettes burn to the hilt while laying on the sink edge. Another tenant I completed the entire eviction process (both actions) against to ensure it was permanently on his record so future landlords know the kind of person he is.  


The majority of Smoker are some of the most disrespectful, lazy, self centered drug addict's I've ever met. The lack of understanding or caring of the damage smoking causes to rental property (Both physically and monetarily from other lost potential renters). Often, like the examples I gave above, they blatantly ignored that clause. I am always very clear that indoor smoking is not allowed in my properties and that I will hold violators accountable. And I do, much to their surprise.  


Just think of how many issues I've had over the last 20 years that has lead me to this position. I used to feel petty pushing the issue, until I did the numbers on how much money I had spent/lost due to people smoking inside my properties.

"Most people don't smoke in houses, apartments, and duplexes when renting because smoke is extremely difficult to get out of walls/carpet (and furniture of your rental is furnished) and it makes it hard to re-rent the property when someone leaves. Because of that, most renters don't want to lose their security deposit or foot the bill to clean it--and judges are not friendly to people who damaged the property by smoking.

The growth has to come with a fundamental shift in the economic structure of the basin.

"We have the space, the resources, and the attraction. Klamath Falls is literally the gateway city to just about everything related to natural beauty in Southern Oregon, most notably Crater Lake.  
And with I-5 effectively at-capacity for freight over the already dangerous Siskiyou Summit, the US97 truck/rail corridor is naturally the next best option to pick up in terms of Klamath being a transportation hub. Did I also mention our airport is already well equipped to handle large jets thanks to the presence of Kingsley Field, it just needs new demand for airlines to come back?   

The high desert beauty (and some decent marketing) is what made Bend explode as a place to *live*. We have everything Bend has, and I'd say even a little bit more; it just hasn't been capitalized on yet.  

Also, can you think of any other reasonably large city center within Oregon that currently has a low cost of living as low as Klamath? Even Medford and it's outlying areas, while historically have been fairly inexpensive, have really rocketed up in price with effectively zero further growth potential left simply due to natural land restrictions. Eugene is the same way. Anything north of Albany is already mostly developed and doesn't have the charm or draw of the high desert. And you obviously can't go further east or northeast than Klamath/Bend, because it's nothing but dry mountains with no water and arctic-worthy winters that really hamper any rapid development. So that leaves Klamath as the next natural place for flightless California birds to land with their gobs of development money.

From personal experience a living there most of my life basically it's just boredom and the economy not being as advanced as it should be to elevate those bored minds so a lot of crime happens a lot of gang violence and a lot of influence because we're so close to the border of  California happens so what I would say is base your opinions off the interactions you have with the people you surround yourself with horses what's going on because just like any City there's always something going on that's crazy but if you're surrounded by the right people you don't even notice.,t2_etbh28j3,NativePersuasion30,0,1636874356.0,0,t1_hkk7iy4,hkk7iy4,True,bogbunzhun,t3_qtdapl,https://www.reddit.com/r/KlamathFalls/comments/qtdapl/how_often_do_you_see_or_experience_violence_in/,How often do you see or experience violence in Klamath?,/r/KlamathFalls/comments/qtdapl/how_often_do_you_see_or_experience_violence_in/hkk7iy4/,5,r/KlamathFalls,0,5
"I've been here since 1986 and I haven't seen any violence towards anyone.  There's a bunch in the police blotter in the paper, but it seems to usually involve people who know one another and there's usually drugs or alcohol involved.  I only know 2 people who've had their house or business broken into, and a couple people who've had their cars broken into.  We've kept our cars parked outside for the 23 years we've been living at our current address and haven't had any problems.  We do have plenty of exterior lighting at night and we don't leave stuff in the cars to be a temptation, so that probably helps quite a bit.  I have a concealed carry permit but I rarely carry my sidearm as I've never felt the need to.  I do carry my pepper spray with me when I leave the house tho.  Living here is just like anywhere else.  Pay attention to what's going on around you and don't get into any situations you may not be able to get out of!

Edit: I got curious about the crime stats in KF so had a look.  I think they paint a picture that looks worse than it is.  Most of the stuff I looked at was ""per 100,000 population"".  Well there's only 21,000 in the KF city limits and about 68,000 in the entire county.  There's one chart that shows KF having over 20 murders in 2016.  There were actually 5, which is 5 too many, but when they extrapolate those stats out as if we have 100,000 population, it really distorts the reality of what's going on.",t2_582w0,kwkfor,0,1636867418.0,0,t1_hkjwday,hkjwday,True,bogbunzhun,t3_qtdapl,https://www.reddit.com/r/KlamathFalls/comments/qtdapl/how_often_do_you_see_or_experience_violence_in/,How often do you see or experience violence in Klamath?,/r/KlamathFalls/comments/qtdapl/how_often_do_you_see_or_experience_violence_in/hkjwday/,7,r/KlamathFalls,0,7

"Very high crime rate. 46% higher than the national average. One out of every 25 people will be a victim of a crime here.   If I had known that, I wouldn’t have come here. 

Also, drugs are “decriminalized “ the city doesn’t have enough city lights to keep people from being hit when walking or crossing the road. It’s an ok place to live but needs lots of changes which city counsel doesn’t really like to do.

Cars are stolen and parted out, high human trafficking area, lots of drugs, mental illness, and poverty, high housing prices(not like CA but it’s still a problem for wages earned)and not enough housing available, gangs, etc. 

Unless you work for the city, county, state or in the mental health/ health field, I wouldn’t bother, there are much better places to live that are cheaper, have less crime, and plenty of jobs and housing.

I'd be more concerned about your car. Klamath Falls has a high car theft rate. Just don't leave your keys or valuables in your car. Most of those violence statistics I believe are referring to domestic violence. Klamath County is one of the poorest counties in the state.

Starlink is pretty variable in speed/latency as they tweak the satellites! and still in beta rollout. Their user count is very limited and I highly doubt you'll ever get it being in a city center with other options available, since it is not and never was meant for you.

"Let an old guy speak a few words.  I was born here.

In any 'Smalltown USA' you are going to find nightlife somewhat limited.  Employment opportunities will be limited, as will travel be a bit difficult.  Stick with the big cities for 'club life', while Klamath has dozens of bars, if you're looking to meet and make friends with folks with drinking problems you're probably going to get that opportunity anywhere you go.  Small towns force you to entertain yourself and that can be a real learning experience for some.  Some fail at this aspect of living, you can see them everywhere.

Klamath has many employment opportunities for white collar and blue collar folks and the current need for service workers nation wide has also impacted Klamath.

Travel is an odd call - I can drive from my house to Medford and be thru security waiting for my flight to be called before my friends in San Carlos can make it to the SF airport and finally make it thru their security!  They drove thru dense traffic and walked a mile to catch the shuttle to the lineup for security while I drove thru heavily forested areas and by half a dozen lakes to catch my plane.

Klamath has a large number of active service clubs, whether it's Kiwanis, Rotary, Smart Reading, or any other organization, they each provide a means to meet like-minded people and build friendships instead of just acquaintances.

I live in the downtown area and I'm 5 minutes from rural hiking trails, 15 minutes from a large number of lakes and rivers, and half an hour from true wilderness areas.  I'm an hour from Crater Lake national Park, The lava Beds National Monument, and the Klamath Marsh Wildlife Refuge.

The weather in the Klamath area is second to none!  Before we screwed up the climate the natural low humidity of the Cascade east side high desert provided the Klamath Basin with breathtakingly beautiful Spring and Fall environments, Summers were cool with few days in the 90's.  Winters are just wonderful, you look outside and see clear blue skys and the temperature is 28F!  If winter precipitation occurs it is almost always white!

Yes, we have drug problems. Yes, we have poverty. Yes, we have racism. Every town/city does, no matter where you go these are aspects of our American Society.  In Klamath County 7 out of 10 people voted for trump, twice!  But we put up with that and work to change it because moving elsewhere to change that equation you will double your cost of living and reduce the quality of your living environment substantially!!",t2_bhv5x9h2,ReverandDoctorDuck,0,1632761470.0,0,t1_hehnzdp,hehnzdp,True,bella-ay-ay,t3_puc2gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/KlamathFalls/comments/puc2gt/thinking_about_moving_here/,Thinking about moving here…,/r/KlamathFalls/comments/puc2gt/thinking_about_moving_here/hehnzdp/,2,r/KlamathFalls,0,2

"I've lived here for a year now and saw a lot of negative posts on this thread about ""Klameth"" and how bad it is and thought,  ""it's all about perspective"" or ""to each their own"" and let me tell you they were right. 

For starters, it's a very conservative place and there are a lot of Trump 2024 signs up, that speaks for itself. Many people that I've met are not open minded in any way and greatly lacking education and life experience.

 There is a college here, OIT, but really no places to mingle or hang out except for a tap house that is newer and a few bars. The main bar the younger crowd likes to hang at had some mishap with the owner making transphobic jokes on their social media and then following up with a messy non apology post. 

There is NO good food here. Nibbleys has a good breakfast and great desserts and the Mexican places are all generically good but it's a win here if you go out to eat and your meal isn't actively bad. 

The smoke was here to stay FOR MONTHS this summer which made it unbearable to go outside and enjoy anything, as we do live in an area that is accessible to nice outdoor activities if you're into that. 

Many people have trash and junk in their yards. I live in a nice subdivision and just last weekend a truck with some tweakers was attempting to camp out in an empty field across the street. There's a lot of petty theft due to the drugs and just a huge population of white trash. It's not diverse at all, and just recently at a town meeting about diversity someone brought a stone with the stated intention to stone someone to death because of the color of their skin and their serial orientation.


 It's nice that the cost of living is very low and hey, they just opened a really nice dog park. However, the good does not outweigh the bad. It's super remote and if you ever want to travel by flight anywhere that's not Denver or Seattle for a reasonable price and duration, you have to drive a minimum of 4 hours to an actual airport. Not to mention, everything moves slower here in the sense that there's no urgency to get things done. There have been many times where I had to deal with the city here or local businesses and they just blow you off, don't call back, etc. Anyways I wish you the best of luck, it depends on what you're looking for and what you're into but that's my perspective being a young professional transplant here.",t2_8i09w9sc,prncspkl,0,1632461509.0,0,t1_he23ync,he23ync,True,bella-ay-ay,t3_puc2gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/KlamathFalls/comments/puc2gt/thinking_about_moving_here/,Thinking about moving here…,/r/KlamathFalls/comments/puc2gt/thinking_about_moving_here/he23ync/,6,r/KlamathFalls,0,6

"Because the scale of water use is not comparable,and it would not be worth the political uproar.  

The city of KF uses 2.6 billion gallons of water a year. To convert to farmer terms, that's 8,000 acre feet of water.

The technical full-allocation water right of the Klamath Project to divert surface water from the Klamath lake is **350,000** acre feet. Initial delivery projections at the start of the year were around 140,000ac/ft, then 80,000ac/ft... Then 35,000ac/ft.... Then zero.

If even a TENTH of the irrigated land in the Project switched to supplemental or emergency ground water wells (which they have), they're using astronomically more water now than the city ever has. Cutting an overly-optimistic 10% of the city's demand is literal drops in the bucket at this scale. 

Granted, just a simple ""Hey if you want to help out stop watering your lawn and turn your showers off"" would be appreciated, but considering the visceral hate that most Klamath residents spew at the mere thought of doing the bare minimum to keep people from dying of a preventable disease, that would go over like a sack of bricks and just turn into a ""fuck liberals!"" protest. They don't understand the precedent of this drought, they just think it's all them Durn sucker trash fish.

Right below the Keno dam on what we call the middle section of the Klamath River. And then you can fish down below the boil powerhouse on the lower Klamath River.

"Sorry to hear this. I am checking out different parts of Oregon for a potential move, and took an exploratory trip to Klamath Falls recently. While it’s beautiful, I got a crash course on the “State of Jefferson.” I learned to do a *lot more homework* before my next trip. That’s why I’m following this sub too. To hear about local happenings and get a feel for the people. It’s a mixed bag, which I think most places will be. It depends on the percentages though. 

Perhaps you should consider moving if the political leanings are that much of an issue. They would be for me too, so no hate here. These views radiate out into a lot of decisions made by local governments, that trickle down to communities. I don’t want to set up a home and contribute to the economy of a place where a majority of people have regressive policies, engage in conspiracy theories, support the insurrection, and are DL racists and bigots.

"Unless there is equipment still on the barge DLT has (or had, don't know the status of the company) I don't think any of the algae companies have anything that would assist with dredging. They all either skim algae off the surface, or suction and strain the water. None of it is designed to handle large volumes of silt. Even if the DLT barge has the equipment for dredging still, it's ancient and probably cheaper to buy/make new equipment than it is to get the barge in working order.

"Now, I am NOT the best person to be responding to this since I'm as white as white gets, but from what I've observed and heard from good friends:  

There is quite a bit of racism, but it's mostly on the down-low from the older retired folk and old-guard farmers, and it's mostly directed towards people of native american or Mexican descent (of which there is a *very* sizable population here). Blacks and Asians seem to be ""okay"", although I imagine they just don't say those parts out loud like they do with the ""damn injuns"", and also because we have very few of that demographic in the area.  

We do have our fair share of meth-fueled nutcases, like the ""White Women are for White Babies"" nutjob who got put in jail a couple years ago. But any area will have those. 

If you're on the younger side, there's a sizable student population in town of people here for KCC and OIT, they're all quite welcoming of any color, gender or sexual orientation.

"Not mentioned by everyone here is we actually have a rather robust homeschooling system, funded by the county school district. Really common for a lot of the farm kids since they can do schoolwork on their own schedule while still handling farm duties.  
If it's practical for your family, you can do all the classes from home using their curriculum materials and online courses, avoiding a lot of the typical public school shenanigans.

Yes there are going to be drug issues, no matter what school your kid goes to, though as far as I can tell there were no bullying issues. Yes there are state/national initiatives kids can get themselves involved in. All depends on their motivation. 

If I were to do it all over again I’d probably involve him in Henley HS if I could, seems the best round here and also with an ROTC program (not that he would have been in the slightest interested lol).

"I would rate our local schools as decidedly average. In pretty much all metrics. 

When it comes to athletics, we have a few state championships scattered around the basin. Occasionally we get a good run from a team for a few years. The two biggest high schools float on the edge of 4A/3A usually 4A, so end up competing with much larger schools. Wrestling teams are usually pretty good. I wouldn't count on seeing many scouts for other sports.

Academically, I think the city high school probably has the better college prep system, but both district's partner with the community college for various courses. I think almost all of the honors type courses and the shop type classes go through the CC now.

Probably about average for bullying and drug use as well. It's a smaller city. Not a lot to do, so kids party.

Most of our school zones are fairly well mixed (with a few exceptions) meaning there tends to be a good mix of kids from all layers of the socio-economic spectrum. There are a couple individual elementary schools that are out of balance. I felt like while I was in school (20 years ago) that this resulted in less bullying/conflict due to class difference than other district's I was familiar with.

I will say, if you can afford it, both of the local private (Christian) schools have really competitive academic and athletic programs.",t2_1e9zqx15,Kalimni45,0,1623047591.0,0,t1_h0vsd6l,h0vsd6l,True,weddingdaze218,t3_nu3hr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/KlamathFalls/comments/nu3hr6/school_system_in_klamuth_falls/,School system in Klamuth Falls?,/r/KlamathFalls/comments/nu3hr6/school_system_in_klamuth_falls/h0vsd6l/,2,r/KlamathFalls,0,2
