It's a very specific request because that's the very specific demographic I'm looking for to mingle with. If I want to mingle with nerds I'll go to game quest. If I want to mingle with writers I'll join a writing club.

She did give me a book about marriage once that turned out to be a lot more churchy/preachy than I expected, but she didn't take issue with it when I said I read the first couple chapters and didn't think it was a good fit for me. And I'm pretty sure not all the therapists there are even personally religious.",t2_4xe2yf1w,stardropunlocked,0,1648184970.0,0,t1_i21393i,i21393i,True,brobawesome,t3_tn85gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortwayne/comments/tn85gy/non_religious_marriage_counseling/,Non Religious Marriage Counseling??,/r/fortwayne/comments/tn85gy/non_religious_marriage_counseling/i21393i/,1,r/fortwayne,0,1

Nobody is living on the street because of a wage garnishment. That's what bankruptcy is for. People live on the streets because they are mentally ill and drug addicted; that is the case with nearly all visible homeless. 

The heroin addict that is rushed to the hospital after his 10th OD is not giving the slightest bit of thought to the hospital bill or any resulting credit report entry. The hospital knows this, and won't even try too hard to bill him.

Why do the poorest of the poor use the emergency room as a doctor's office? Because it's free to them. They sure as shit wouldn't be doing it if they cared about the resulting bill, which would be huge.

"Your take on this misunderstands a basic rental market economics point.

Adding to housing supply, even with newer, more expensive units, still adds to supply. Some of the people who move in here will open up other units of similar quality or one level down in the hierarchy, and then other people can upgrade into those units, and so on. 

Yesterday's pricier new housing typically becomes tomorrow's mid-range and affordable housing as it gets older, as tastes change, etc.

"I've lived in numerous places/states. I'm from Virginia, moved here December of 2020.

Hands down, Fort Wayne is awful.

Grey is the only word that comes to mind when I think of the personality types that make Fort Wayne.
The food is tasteless, the roads are horrid, what people here consider to be nice areas to live are awful compared to what I've considered to be nice.
Don't even ask about how aggressive and defensive drivers are here. How personally they take anyone wanting to get around them properly. And don't ask about the awful train tracks and the lack of actual schedule.
If you're from here and you don't know any better then sure.. the nostalgia and 'if we know you we love you' mentality exists. But its not welcoming by any stretch of the word.
I noticed someone stated that they wondered how many people actually lived elsewhere long enough to compare it to someplace else... well I have and so has my fiancé who's actually from here. Moving back has been a mistake and a massive let down. Maybe you people should try living elsewhere for that same comparison?
Cheap and affordable isn't enough of a reason to mark Fort Wayne as a top place to live. Because cheap and affordable leaves plenty of room for poverty and people with half broken down cars with zero fucks given.
Oh, lastly, redlights are quite optional 'round these parts. Just sayin.
So come grab a hot dog since those are the holy grail and prepare yourself for the let down of the century.
Be sick of the hate all you want.. comparing it to shittier places doesn't make it any less shitty. Maybe the least of the compared evils.

I bought some obedient plants last year from them, and hope they really take over this unattractive section in my alley. For the clematis, I had to do a serious search to find this specific plant. If you can find it, I highly recommend. It has small white very fragrant flowers.

"I have a bad, bad impression of VA hospitals from experiences with my dad many years ago.  Maybe things improved here and in Marion in the past 20 years.   The biggest problem came when he had a colonoscopy done here by a VA surgeon.  He was scheduled for surgery to remove a tumor(cancer) after the scope.  They sent him to an ""outside"" surgeon in town who looked at the VA records and said, ""I can't do the surgery.  I don't know where the tumor is because the guy that did the colonoscopy at the VA didn't include the location in his notes.""      ----  We took dad to INDY to a non-VA surgeon and non-VA INDY hospital. He had a 2nd scope and surgery the same day.

Experiences at the Marion outpatient facility were just as bad.  I'd take him for his appt. and we'd wait 2, 3, 4 hours to see the doc for the doc to barely look or talk to either of us. The doc took forever to enter new Rx orders into the system.   It was awful, non-existent ""care"".  -- We had to go because it was the only way he could afford his meds.  For all of his actual care, we took him to outside docs, used his Medicare to cover those costs and  had the VA doc rewrite any Rx's he got to get them filled at the VA.

Absolutely the worst excuse for doctors and ""care""  I'd ever seen. (   I've been to a LOT of doctors, hospitals and clinics in INDY, Columbus OH, Ann Arbor MI and small town Indiana.  I know what good and bad healthcare facilities and providers are like.

"I can't tell if you're 16 or 60, to say something that embarrassing. A gallon of gas costs more than minimum wage, registering a car costs a shocking amount of money, and neither parking, insurance, nor the car itself is free. I've got two for a household of four adults, but we've got that sweet ""perpetuated American Imperialism"" money. Your average Zoomer or Millenial is broke, my dude.  The age of cars is dead, but our whole city (our whole country) is still built around them. Henry Ford fucked us, pushing for wider streets, jaywalking laws, and huge shifts in urban planning, to sprawling everything, suburbs miles from food, jobs, and medical care and ribbons of impassable concrete carving up the city while suppressing mass transit in favor of traffic jams.

All to burn a non-renewable fuel we get by funding nightmare regimes. And if you're over 40, you spent your entire developmental period saturated in airborne lead particles; they weren't banned until 1996, and your brain is basically ruined because of it. And those poor bastards still raised most of us, so... none of us is untouched by that catastrophe yet.

Bicycles are a day one solution, but this problem is way, way bigger than your individual choices, assuming you can even afford a choice in this economy. Bicycles don't get our disabled neighbors where they need to go, nor do they help when it's below freezing for months at a time. They don't get groceries for a family to distant housing. They don't get your scant worldly possessions to a new apartment across town when your old one refuses to maintain habitable conditions in exchange for your ever-increasing rent.  They've made a world where cars are the only short term solution, and then priced the working class out of them. This is a goddamn crisis, my guy. ""Buy a car"" is like telling a houseless person to ""get a job."" Not only should they not have to in a just society, but they functionally *must* to survive this one, they already know this, and the means to do so are absent or broken.

"My son had a lot of smallish (not grand mal) seizures through his early high school years and continued for years after that.  He did very poorly in high school, we assume because all the micro seizures he was having (or because we're bad parents).  His first pediatric neurologist was terrible (Fort Wayne neurology), who said he didn't actually have a seizure.  Within a week of that consultation, he had one at school and a teacher who was familiar with seizures recognized it and then we sent him to a different pediatric neurologist (independent doctor) who said he would always have them.  We thought she was pretty good but she ended moving out of town.  We went back to Fort Wayne neurology and they said he would always have them and he would be lucky to only have a couple per year.  The group actually fired her (they didn't say why).  His next neurologist was from the same group and that doctor also got fired.  VERY weird huh?

At this point we did a lot more research and were willing to go anywhere in the US.  We ended up going to Cleveland Clinic (top 10 in the world) and was fortunate to have to have the head of the department, Dr. Punia, to be our son's doctor.

On the very first visit, Dr. Punia said the goal was no seizures.  He immediately recognized that some of his anti-seizures meds were too low, while the previous doctors said he was at the max.  After he did many tests and med changes Dr. Punia decided that he was a candidate for brain surgery (actually I think this goes to a board of doctors at Cleveland Clinic).  That whole process of test and med changes took a couple of years as brain surgery is the last resort. 

A little over 4 years ago he had brain surgery and has NO seizures since then.  He has a yearly video conference with Dr. Punia to evaluate how things are going and he gets his anti-seizures meds reduced at that time.  These are very heavy duty meds that he was on but they are slowly getting reduced.

He's now in his late 20's and going to graduate from PFW with a B.S. in Computer Science.  We're so proud of him.


**In hind sight, we regret not finding a neurologist outside of Fort Wayne sooner.**
