"Some additions:  
In TX they can appraise it every year, and they're required to do it at least every 3. They don't go out to every home, the don't have the people for that. They literally look at comps in the area and base the total on that. So if a bunch of houses in your 1 mile radius suddenly go for 700k, and your house is the same size, your value goes up.

They can only increase it by 10% per year for now but they can try to raise it 10% every year (based on Jan 1st market value).   
Homeowners get a property tax doc every Oct that's due by the end of Jan, and if it seems high to the owner, it's easy enough to protest the amount.   
Each county/city jurisdiction also has its own rules, so voting in local elections is important for keeping property taxes down. School boards, city councils, and county commissioners are the ones who decide what the budget is for the year and that can increase tax rates.

"I understand your frustration. I‚Äôm definitely lucky to have been able to get a house, having a VA Loan was a huge help

This housing market won‚Äôt stay this crazy forever. If an extended overall economic recession doesn‚Äôt happen it doesn‚Äôt appear that likely that a huge Real Estate crash would happen. Prices are crazy, but lending is no where near as insane as it was in the 2008 crash. 

Eventually prices will definitely stabilize and could be relatively soon as buyers may be priced out soon with rate increases. 

While not the same as these Frisco 700k prices, a $450k-500k house with 10-15% down would be relatively close to your current rent (rough math - $2300-2600/mo PITI & PMI). Other options are out there such as FHA loans with 3.5% down, which of course would increase your monthly payment due to less money down. Sellers are avoiding buyers with FHA loans currently when they can, but this would be less of an issue if (hopefully when) the market calms down.

"I‚Äôm starting this expecting to get hate because my opinion may not match others‚Ä¶I simply do not care. 

The bureaucracy‚Ä¶.all the money I pay in taxes, and the god damn school can‚Äôt pay for kids in debate club? Let‚Äôs stop buying the teachers 7 dollar Starbucks Lattes, and all the kids can travel to the debate club. I‚Äôm sick and tired of all the pre-Madonna Frisco teachers and administrators complaining how they‚Äôre underpaid, this, that, and the other. They‚Äôre some of the highest-paid teachers in the state with such good benefits. Frisco isn‚Äôt the best district, and it‚Äôs trendy downward. The motto of ‚Äúget to know every kid by name‚Äù makes me laugh. The statement that all Frisco cares about is Football, and other athletics is very accurate, considering most kids go nowhere with scholarships or go on to do anything in the athletics department. They feed the egos that they‚Äôre going to be the next Dak Prescott. I get a kid being well rounded but Frisco holds a emphasis to high on sports and not other areas which make a student well rounded. Students who choose against athletics shouldn‚Äôt be subject to a completely different high school experience because of it. If there‚Äôs a way I can directly make an impact, let me know!

Editing to add: You need to get your Debate advisor/teacher on board. Have you approached your counselors or other administrators. If all else fails give superintendent Mike Waldrip aka Egg head a try‚Ä¶probably won‚Äôt have a comment but maybe try his email, in a very well written way? His assistants email is crutchem@friscoisd.org.

Your options are either to lobby the school board (that means attending meetings) until they capitulate, or to fundraise on your own so district money is no longer needed.

"Hey there, welcome to Texas!  
Single guy here living in N. Plano, on the edge of Frisco.  IMO, this is one of the safer areas of Dallas, but I'm sure the amount of crime we have isn't drastically different from any area with this many people.  
&nbsp;  

I'd recommend using something like the apartmentfinder.com map & draw a box around Frisco + the edges of the adjacent 'burbs.   ie: start around 380 & Lewisville Lake and draw down to maybe Parker road. Then go across all the way to I75, then follow 75 all the way back up to 380 and come over to back where you started.   
&nbsp;  
From there, you can filter by single-bedroom or whatever you want.  
Things will generally be cheaper the further to the East you go.  Likewise, the closer you are to Dallas North Tollway & Sam Rayburn intersection, the price will also go up... but the closer you are to those highways, the more easily you'll be able to get elsewhere.  

&nbsp;  
The Legacy/Tollway area is new on the West/older on the East.  Lots of food options there and a bit North at the Star center. 

Since you mention safety several times, you could also look at the map here:

"Yeah if you work in Frisco.  Living near White Rock would be a long commute.  But perhaps someplace to consider for weekend adventures.  

I guess it also depends on what kind of ""vibe"" you want.  Places closer to Dallas and uptown will provide more of an ""eclectic"" and diverse vibe.  But there are plenty of places like Austin Ranch (technically the Colony) just south of Frisco.  Shops of Legacy/Legacy West (which is Plano/Frisco border).  That cater to younger people. and have activities near them.  Legacy West is pretty expensive, but has lots of ""it"" bars restaurants right there you could walk to and ""stumble home"" if that has any appeal.   Austin Ranch was the last place I lived before marriage/kids.  It's been awhile, but there were a couple of ""pub"" type bars there I could walk to that I would meet and make friends at, watch sports, etc. and a couple of restaurants.  There were trails, a couple of sand volleyball courts I'd use and LOTS of pools.   I saw people mention Grandscape which is pretty new, near some large stores.

"First of all, welcome!

There are pros and cons to each of the areas you listed, subjective of course.

- Frisco: essentially a brand new town and the ‚Äúin‚Äù place to be for businesses and people. It‚Äôs a shiny, newly built city that has everything you need and want in it, including some of the best public schools in Texas (for the future). It‚Äôs also very expensive, has a rich, yuppie vibe and driving the DNT (the main artery of travel) is a very costly toll road. You‚Äôll be able to find an apartment, but housing is stupid right now.
- McKinney: The older, more rednecky sibling of Frisco. Some parts are downright sketchy and some parts you expect a kid sitting on the porch playing a banjo. It has some nice parts though! It‚Äôs cheaper than Frisco, but if you need to commute it‚Äôll likely be worse.
- Dallas: Dallas is a mixed bag, but if you‚Äôre in Downtown it‚Äôs very nice (look up the Harwood properties). You‚Äôre close to all the ‚Äúfun‚Äù stuff like bars, museums and shit and they‚Äôve gentrified the fuck out of it, so it‚Äôs pretty nice. If you work downtown the commute is obviously fantastic. Outside of downtown there are pockets of nice neighborhoods (Highland Park) but there are pockets of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gonna get stabbed‚Äù too.",t2_346v7r32,ASicklad,0,1647606350.0,0,t1_i157unj,i157unj,True,float220010,t3_tgzlxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/frisco/comments/tgzlxk/potentially_moving_to_dfw_area/,Potentially moving to DFW area,/r/frisco/comments/tgzlxk/potentially_moving_to_dfw_area/i157unj/,5,r/frisco,0,5

"I think this comment is really spot-on.  With the possible exception of Frisco HS, you are not going to see a huge difference in quality between high schools in Frisco ISD.  Without knowing your financial situation, I would say that housing is FAR more likely to be a limiting factor, and something that is more impactful on quality of life, than picking between these three excellent high schools.  

Among the districts you list, school size/model is definitely a big difference.  Somewhere like Allen with the single-high-school model is a totally different ballgame than somewhere like Frisco with many small high schools.  If you have a kid you want to play in the NFL or something, you might look at Allen because they are a powerhouse (partly due to the huge talent pool of students to draw from), otherwise is can be really negative for kids who want to do extra curriculars without necessarily being the best at everything.

In my opinion Highland Park or Lovejoy are a clear step above, but are also probably easily 2-3x the price to live there (and apartments will not be an option).  Access to DFW airport from Lovejoy is also pretty sketchy, and not excellent from Highland Park (although Love Field is right by HP if that fits your needs).",t2_5dpuzszj,Sea-Main8193,0,1647453136.0,0,t1_i0wtva8,i0wtva8,False,[deleted],t3_tflv1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/frisco/comments/tflv1j/frisco_high_schools/,Frisco high schools,/r/frisco/comments/tflv1j/frisco_high_schools/i0wtva8/,3,r/frisco,0,3
"I honestly don't think there's much of a difference between the three (I'm zoned to Wakeland), so I would recommend looking at housing in all three and pick whatever you can get, assuming you are buying.  There aren't any bad schools in Frisco, though I suppose some will argue Frisco HS is the ""worst"" of the bunch.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Frisco is a small school model.  So think lots of smaller schools (at all levels).  Allen and Plano to a lesser extent have fewer, larger schools.  There is only one HS in Allen and it is huge.  Plano has just a handful.  Fewer, bigger schools mean your kid will be less likely to participate in extra curriculars.  That matters to some people, but not to others.  Prosper is going through the same massive growth that Frisco went through about 10-15 years ago.  There will be lots of rezoning as new schools are built.  Frisco even has this issue in certain pockets that still have new construction.  

Honestly, if you will be utilizing the airport often (assuming DFW), cross Prosper and Allen off your list.  If you are dead set on Plano or Frisco, live as close to 121 as possible.  I live in far NW Frisco and my husband used to travel out of DFW weekly and it was a decent commute.  Traffic is bad here and just a few drops of rain seem to make people forget how to drive.

You can find online maps of light pollution, and you will have to go about 30-50 miles from any population center to find somewhere that is clear enough. Even then, natural weather patterns can greatly reduce your ability to see stars just from humidity levels.

And when i say 'any population center' I am talking about *any* population center. Just the highway lighting near podunk 3k population towns will scatter enough light to cause your pupils to contract (not dilate, oopsie) within 20-30 miles.

"I grew up in east Texas (Longview area) and have lived in frisco off and on for 15 years.  I would absolutely suggest moving if you get the opportunity.  There are of course ups and downs but the good far outweigh the bad.  

Some pros 
-There are limitless things to do.  You‚Äôre minutes from the star, grandscape (biggest shopping and retail center in the metroplex and features the biggest furniture store in the world Nebraska Furniture Mart), Shops at Legacy, main st., just to name a few. 
-Easy access to highways to get around the city 
-Low crime rate 
-Lots of schools -great school district 
-Plenty of entertainment options with theaters, etc 
-Tons of corporate headquarters (Google it, there are a ton and that won‚Äôt even include Toyota which is on the border

Cons 
-Traffic is going to take some getting used to
-Cost of living is much higher than Tyler 
-Tax rate is tough if you own a home 
-One of the fastest growing cities in the country which comes with a lot of construction 
-You‚Äôre going to pay a pretty good amount of money on tolls.  Collin county is the second highest county in the US after NYC

I currently live in a town that borders Frisco called Little Elm.  You get Frisco amenities but pay much less in taxes and it‚Äôs very short drive to the area.  It‚Äôs a great options and the houses are a fraction of the cost of Frisco (they‚Äôre still expensive don‚Äôt get me wrong but they‚Äôre better).

One of the best decisions I ever made was to get out of east Texas and move to this area.   Good luck!

"You're using ""literally"" hyperbolically and figuratively, which is a valid rhetorical technique.

As for moving here, it's gonna be hard if you're that attached to your current environment.  Moving always is.  And it will be expensive.  Cost of housing alone has gone up 15-25% just in the last few months, and it isn't slowing down.

That said, I think you should give it a shot, and give yourself at least a year to try it out. Making new friends is always hard, so don't expect to find the same friends you had back home, just try to make new friends in similar spaces.  Look up Meetup groups, theater groups, any other type of group or activity that you enjoy in Tyler, and see what you find here.  

And stay in touch with former friends--have Zoom meetings, FaceTime, phone calls,  whatever.  Tyler isn't that far so plan some weekend visits both ways.

"Frisco is a great city. Much different than Tyler, though. Plus, it‚Äôs like a 2-3 hour drive so if you guys ever want to go back and visit family or friends it doesn‚Äôt seem impossible.

I'm not even asking people to look further than the past 20 years to see this hahaha. We're just a bunch of morons with mush for brains if we just learn from public school or political extreme groups. 
I'm from a freaking developing nation at the age of barely 13. I even flunked a grade back there. Yet when I came here, I tested into AP courses a year later and was the top student alongside a Canadian in US history in 8th grade, joining in the middle of the school year fresh off the boat.....all for just sitting in class and sharing the teachers interest for National Treasure and the Monroe doctrine. 

I didn't learn fuck all since my time back in Asia and I never did a single homework assignment or study for a test. I just paid attention in class since I was there already, did sports, didn't do drugs till 10th grade and partied my ass off. I took all but English in AP and I wish I did. My classmates in those classes made me want to just put the window for how stupid and disrespectful they were. Literally hollering like monkeys. This is a very polite and progressive in a good way city with a lot of money. Can't imagine the actual US as a young student growing up.

"My apologies! That is correct, both Bermuda and Zoysia are non-native I was looking at the wrong notes. I was looking at my adapted plants list, not native.

Bermuda and Zoysia are two species of grasses used in Frisco that have become adapted to the Texas heat. Bermuda is the most used and cheapest, but is not very shade tolerant, it has to be in the open sun. So trees tend to kill Bermuda grass.

Zoysia is a hardier grass from Australia and South Asia that is shade tolerant, needs less water, and hardier but it is not native and it is pricy. 

For Native grasses the city irrigation team recommended trying to use Buffalograss. It is their favorite native grass to recommend to people, but it is also pricy. Cool side note: Buffalo grass only grows to a max of about 1 ft, so it is a good grass to use for vacant lots and fields where you won't be able to frequently go out and trim.

"Used to work for an awesome wildlife management company that would also handle rat issues. You probably have a few issues going on:

1) If there were previous rats in the home then the cleaning people needed to do a chemical sanitation of the attic space. Male rats release a pheromone every time they pee that draws other rats. The more pee the more draw as it is seen as a safe place. Regular vacuuming won't remove that.

2) You have to make sure any holes large enough to fit a sharpie marker in are properly sealed. Caulk and expanding foam won't work, I recommend using roofing cement. 

2.5) Weep holes. If your home is brick then you should have weep holes at the foundation line. Make sure they are all screened properly in a way that still allows for weepage. My go to is quarter inch hardware clothe (next to the chicken wire at lowes and home depot).

3) A/C Units: Most ac unit refrigerant lines enter the home through a hole in the exterior of the home. Those holes are supposed to be properly sealed up but usually aren't. Look for where the black-insulated line enter the home and see if there is still an open hole there. Is so then seal it up with roofing cement.

4) Eave Returns: If your home has two sections of roof that come together at an angle, that is an eave return. Eave returns are not required to be tightly sealed in Texas and if the two sections don't come together tightly then you can easily have a hole that goes straight from your roof to your attic with nothing in between.  I've seen some Eave return gaps that even I could crawl through.

5) Finally, Pest Control: Rats and Mice will always keep coming back because they are not a house problem, they're a neighborhood problem. You can kick all of them out of your home, but they'll just come back from whatever other house in your neighborhood has them. Even when you properly seal up all of the holes they'll try to chew a new way in. The solution is bait boxes, those black plastic boxes you see outside businesses and restaurants. Bait boxes have a bait inside of them that draws the rats to go chew on the bait instead of your home. The trick is finding a pest control company that uses environmentally friendly baits. I recommend using Contrac Blox myself. They are metabolic poisons that break up inside the rats blood stream and don't cause secondhand poisoning to animals that eat the poisoned rat (like hawks and dogs). It is also a non-painful death for the rat as it causes internal bleeding and basically makes them slip into a coma and die from blood loss. If you keep having rats, then you NEED pest control.

"Hey morse!

1) So the city irrigators and landscapers actually push for native grasses on all new construction sites over the last few years. The go to that most landscaping teams use is Bermuda, which is native, but the teams also recommend looking into Zoysia. It's a lot more expensive but the long term hardiness makes it worth the cost.

2) The rain barrel program offered by the city is almost at cost for them. They make almost no money off the kits being sold. As for making it mandatory, it's hard to make anything mandatory in Texas. It tends to get blowback from all sides of the aisle.

3) still working on this one

4) There used to be a rebate tied to having smart-controllers for irrigation systems, but people were taking advantage of it and overwatering their yards then using the rebate money to pay the fines. SO the city did away with it as they found it was causing MORE water waste.  Alternative options are being looked into.

Edit: For #1 I said that Bermuda and Zoysia are native grasses. That is incorrect, I was looking at the wrong notes. That mistake is on me and not the city irrigation crews.

"This entitled woman was part of an all out, albeit under-coordinated, attack on our nations capitol. Many people from Collin County share the same views as her. They publicly support a person like her. 

There‚Äôs an American version of the ‚Äúfreedom convoy‚Äù Canadian protest planned for America in the coming months. If this is any indication of continued conservative protest, our country will have a very challenging time between Caucasians and police. 

I truly feel that many white people in America are mad about people of color protesting and rioting in 2020 and they want their own dog and pony show. They started by protesting pandemic measures and they‚Äôre just gonna keep on protesting because they feel they should get a turn. 

Maybe people of color will start protesting again and we will have people from every color protesting In America. Everyone will be protesting so much that they will forget what it takes to be a citizen of this country. And guess who will profit off of all of that? If you said ‚Äúour leaders in government‚Äù, ding ding ding ding ding! You would be correct!

"Anytime past 10-11pm on weekdays seems to be the clear up time for traffic in the area, granted I do most of my driving close to or past midnight when no one is out.
Think I saw another redditor say something similar, but really anything north of Eldorado and especially the new PGA Parkway (also known as rock hill for the oldies) is new and open. even Preston north of Main Street can be a chill drive.
Virginia parkway (also attached to PGA Parkway, changes at coit) in McKinney over to Adriatica is also a great night time drive! 
Just venturing around some of the surrounding cities to Frisco can be a nice refresher (Little Elm, Prosper, Celina, Aubrey, McKinney, maybe a touch of Plano & Allen)

"Go to the store and buy at least 2 rat traps for each attic space you can get to. Put peanut butter and bird seed on one of them, and nutella and bird seed on the 2nd one. 

Check them daily until you no longer have rats in the attic. Even after they are gone, leave all of the traps set and baited and check them monthly. 

The green poison works sometimes, but then you'll have a dead rat rotting in your attic which smells for a few weeks.

It's a normal thing in every house I have lived in. In some cases, rats/mice will disappear for a few years, but then some building or development in the area pushes them through the neighborhood.",t2_8zini,r3dk0w,0,1645146868.0,0,t1_hxdygrd,hxdygrd,True,wontrevealmyidentity,t3_sv4jpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/frisco/comments/sv4jpm/rat_problems/,Rat problems,/r/frisco/comments/sv4jpm/rat_problems/hxdygrd/,5,r/frisco,0,5

A tree is like a pump extract water, if you don't feed it enough, it will extract the water and make your land uneven. Then $20k foundation repair will happen. it's a simple math of waste 20 bucks a month vs a 20k one-time repair.
