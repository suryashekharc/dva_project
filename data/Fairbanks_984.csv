"I drive a diesel ram 2500 4x4. My husband drives a subaru ascent. I spent all of January driving his car when he was away, it handled great. But my heavy duty truck handled some things better. We live in the hills, I never slid my truck past our road but got close in the ascent. 

I don't necessarily advise getting a big ass truck to drive if you have never done it. I'd look at subarus for sure. Good winter tires and a reliable awd vehicle will be useful. Plus not letting others bully you into driving speeds you're not comfortable with is another big thing. Drive to the conditons and your comfort level.

"Yes, but it's windy often times.

I was there in early February and it was about 0F in the parking lot but then the wind chill up top was enough to freeze ice into the hair on my face and cold enough that my dog who gets cold around -30F or -40F or so was looking to me concerned as to why we were up there and he stood in a C shape to not blow over.

I had to walk partly sideways an get my head turned away from the wind. We made it up to the top, looked around an went back down. 

I had a fleece face mask/balaclava but no googles.

"I drive a Prius with studded tires in the winter. It’s generally good enough, though I occasionally hit my skid plate if the main roads have been scraped to pavement and the side roads have lots of buildup. 40 MPG is really nice with how much gas costs up here. Got almost 150,000 miles on it. 

Really though it depends on where you live and what kind of driving you need to do. If you live far off the main roads and need to drive to Anchorage while it’s snowing, you’d probably want AWD

It has stock 17 inch alloy wheels and the ice ribs have damaged them and now 2/4 leak enough I have to pump them up every few days.

I plan to get plain black steel wheels in 16 inch because the tires are cheaper and the sidewall is bigger giving more cushion for the bump

I run studless michillin Ipike 3's and they are good tires. I also really like firestone weather grip tires because they can be used in the shoulder seasons in slightly wintry conditions and they sipe rain and mud very very well.

I used to have a rear wheel drive (2wd) suv that I paid $500 for and and I paid $880 for tires. Then I sold the SUV running but with a nearly failed clutch and a bad slave cylinder for $300 and the tires for $360 a couple years later.

I used to have a subaru I paid $500 for and it came with winter tires that brand new were like $700.

There is some predictability to the aurora strength, I can see now from the forecast for instance that April 1 and April 2nd are forecasted to be moderate strength (5 out of 10). But that doesn't actually tell you where the aurora will be visible. 

For short term you can look at the [SWPC](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) page which has a picture of where they think the aurora will be visible at any given time with like a 1 hour forecast. 

But the best luck I've had catching a lot of shows is to set up a network of friends where you all just agree to text each other when there's a good show.

"You're kind of asking a loaded question, but it's not your fault. I used to live in Fairbanks, but I would love to move back. However, just to illuminate for you why this is loaded, there's a mentality perpetuated that Anchorage isn't *real* Alaska or that its residents think they are better. What I have learned since moving here is that I haven't met a single person in Anchorage that doesn't have other places in Alaska that they love. No one here thinks they are better than anyone else. Other than wasilla. 😉

You have more access to things from Anchorage, but Fairbanks is a lot simpler and both offer things the other doesn't. So I would suggest that you find what you would like to do and go from there.

Do you like kayaking or canoeing? Still a split decision. You have a river in Fairbanks or a lake in eklutna.

Riding bikes? You have managed trails in Anchorage and girdwood and mostly safe trails and roads in Fairbanks.

Both have hiking, wildlife, views, and tourist amenities and activities. They both have skanky bars and great restaurants.

We have those spikes you mentioned here in Idaho alot too; those dont bother me.

As you and others mentioned though, having some backup power should help there.

"You can drive 15 mins from town up Ballaine Rd and there’s a “parking lot” on the right side of the road where people congregate to view it. Drive north and as soon as the trees clear, you pull off to a wide open sky. If you see Ballaine on the map, it’s the part that looks like a nose and past the big hill. You can’t miss the wide clearing of trees and Ballaine isn’t a long road. To check on viewing download the Aurora app. It’s purple and blue icon and it’ll give you live forecast and a visual, then cross reference with the weather app for clouds. Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday the Aurora will be strong and should be clear skies Sunday night after clouds move out and should be clear Monday and Tuesday. Be patient when waiting. Sometimes it takes an hour of waiting to get to the good stuff so 10pm-3am it could come and go at any time because it dances in and out of view. Even if the Aurora isn’t out, the stars are pretty and you can almost make out a dim Milky Way arm. Best wishes and enjoy your vacation!

PS. Also view this, it’s a webcam nearby and I use it because there’s too many trees at my place so I go to that spot I mentioned after checking.

"Ship nothing that doesn’t fit in your car. Tires will be more expensive but not so much for the inconvenience. Travel simply. You won’t need winter tires until Sept or later. Mostly clothes and personal outdoor gear. Buy a copy of the Milepost, usually Barnes and Noble has them. You will not need any other guide for planning your trip up or the fun when you get here. When my kids went kayaking in Prince William sound with a UAF guide it was mandated they have a 3 layer system. Light Silk, or wool first layer, middle layer like fleece or wool, or high tech fabric, then your rugged insulated outerwear. You won’t need three layers unless you’re doing outside activity from the interior or above on the coldest days, some exceptions apply. Alaska used to have 7 distinct climate regions. No one knows exactly what these are anymore. See Milepost for details. If you can afford it I highly recommend  taking you vehicle and you the Alaska Marine Hwy Ferry from Prince Rupert BC. It may even be cheaper than gas thru Canada right now  but it’s an experience like no other. It’s basically a 4 day cruise vagabond cruise with time to exit at every port. Support the local Warangal school district and buy some raw uncut gumball sized garnets as you grab a bite and stretch you legs at port in Wrangall. You can camp in a small tent on some of the decks. See milepost. Lots of people take up residence in the front lounge or even the movie lounge.  Yes you can sleep on the floors or rent a cabin. You can drive the Haines Hwy out some other time which is designated one of the works most beautiful hwys. It’s even more scenic heading south than coming north.  I’ve lived here 49 years and my second. Trip on the ferry and the drive south on the Haines has been about my all time favorite. Just my two cents.

"It really blows conservatives minds when you're both a leftist who hates Biden and Kamala Harris for *legitimate* reasons, and you own guns.

The largest growing demographic of first-time gun-owners in 2020 were leftists *because* of the actions of far right extremists and the Overton Window dragging single-issue conservatives with them.

What bugs me was the co-opting of libertarian by expanded capitalist marketeers and ancaps who thinks that unregulated businesses would balance itself out, which obviously doesn't work out and just sharpens the divide between those who have capital compared to those who don't.

And in order to distance yourself from those people, you'd describe it as libertarian-socialism, or left libertarian. And then they get confused because they can't understand that it's not as mutually exclusive as you'd think. It's just that they don't even know the history of where 'libertarian' came from, which were anarchists in the working class that demanded many of the concepts of government we have today.

I then dropped another junkyard hatch during the install and then drove it that winter with the visqueen vs get another.. I had two broken hatches on the ground, glass everywhere and a car with no rear door

It burned like 1 quart of oil every 1,000 miles and the previous owner rarely checked oil level..

I whipped some really really good shitties in that thing. Snow plumes so big it would suck in snow and shut off then I restarted it with a rev and hit er again.

Sold it because it needed an oil change, radiator flush, brakes and soonish would need CV joints and shocks.

You can definitely just go to the Chena yourself in your rental, but be careful on the road out there.

"I was a driver\guide for a tour company in Fairbanks for some time, and did aurora tours this time of year. I honestly can't recommend it to the average tourist with a limited time frame. I spent a lot of time trying to gently let down and explain the elusive nature of aurora with perfect conditions to disappointed people who had shelled out a lot. If everything aligns, its truly amazing, but it may just as easily cloud over and snow, or be perfectly clear and not have a show. It wouldn't be special if it was easy to show up and see, and that's not just a line.

I don't feel good about sending you to good viewing spots if you've never driven where you might encounter ice or snow, but there are plenty of pull outs and viewpoints in the greater area. Check out conditions on the Elliot highway, for example. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to go up the Dalton Highway with your level of experience, even if your rental allows it.

Most, probably all, offer free or low cost housing. Lots of those workers get tips as well as their hourly wage. Lots of J1s work there in the summer so you can meet people from all over the world.

"Uber has something called uberx where you sign in one place and could get dispatched rides or deliveries.

Someone who drives for Uber and lyft told me they started as a dasher. Now he does just rides becauseof a physical reason so he can walk less. He said one paid better and the other kept him more busy so he runs both apps but that he make double what he did as a dasher and barely steps out of his car.

"Wild fish and game is priceless. To the Alaska Native cultures, it’s more than that, it’s culture, spiritual, everything... 
A lot of folks have the perception that fishing and hunting is a cost effective way to get food, but in reality it is a pretty expensive undertaking if you don’t live a subsistence based lifestyle. A rifle, learning how to use it, time scouting, time hunting, good clothing and gear to keep you alive while you do that, all cost money. Fishing is cheaper, but you still have to spend time doing it, you need waders, boots, tackle, freezer, transportation, etc. The food you buy at the store and restaurant is probably a lot cheaper, but that is not comparing the same things. People easily spend five digits to come up here and fish and hunt for sport. Some of the higher end hunts, six figures. If you really want to try some Alaskan game, you are probably going to need to hunt it yourself. Wild fish you can get at restaurants and markets though.  Check out the adfg.alaska.gov site.

You must be coming to visit the pogo mine? South Cushman shooting range is probably the most popular public range in Fairbanks. On a typical summer weekend you’ll find 50+ people there shooting everything from handguns to full auto sub machine guns to long range rifles. But it’s a bring your own guns kind of place. I’m sure if you showed up with a box of 9mm and an Aussie accent someone would be happy to let you pop off lol. The only place I can think of that *might* provide their own guns for a shooting experience would be the alaska department of fish and game indoor shooting range on college road. But it would probably have to be part of some paid course which would entail like 99% safety talk and 1% shooting. A pretty stale shooting experience for a first timer if you ask me. Las Vegas would be a better bet for what you’re looking for.

"I didn't have to worry about cost due to my job however I imagine there are probably a couple of people in a similar boat as I was so ill share anyways and I bet you'd still have to deal with my main sticking point. 

**Main sticking point:** customs. I'd generally keep my car pretty damn clean. Like on a semi-regular basis I'd get a car wash and at the minimum, I'd vacuum out my car and wipe down the interior weekly or more often. But even after thorough cleaning the day of and an hour drive I still had to sit in the back with my wife and duct tape getting whatever dog hair that was buried that a vacuum wasn't gonna get. 

Paperwork: the car is 110% undoubtedly mine paperwork-wise. However, the paperwork that brought me up here was missing the suffix in my name. Something I honestly never think about because that was the first time it's ever come up and been an issue. So after an hour + one way I got told to come back another day after it was fixed. Which ultimately led to my car being shipped one business day before we left for Fairbanks. 

They didn't tell us exactly how *clean* they needed it as far as dog hair the first trip so we very well could've been turned around the day it was shipped. End all be all was that week was extremely stressful trying to take care of everything to get moved up here and also see family for Thanksgiving.

Edit: it took about 3 weeks for my car to get up here from Colorado being shipped to Fairbanks.

"I’m not ragging on OP, but I have to totally agree with your sentiment that most contractors are honest, and often times customers are on super high alert, assuming the contractor is screwing them at every opportunity. 

As a construction worker it gets a little old to hear people saying “I could do that for 1/3 what you are charging”. If you could, you would, but you aren’t, so don’t you value the service I bring?  Everybody is happy when the problem is solved, then “buyers remorse” when the bill comes up. I mean no harm to OP, but it seems that you want the work to be cheap and it isn’t. That’s unfortunate, but doesn’t mean your contractor is guilty. And when you press them to explain the value in their work, they got defensive—who would have guessed it?
