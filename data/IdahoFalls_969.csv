"Our housing market has been ramping up since 2016, but it is currently moving faster than ever. I used to advise people to purchase a home if they would be living there for at least 5 years. Currently, homeowners here are making tens of thousands of dollars in less than a year. 

I sold a condo last February for $273k. That same condo sold again in October for $313k!

House bill 389 changed property tax laws basically changing things to where the local government gets to collect less property taxes from buildings built in their own city and the state gets to take more money. On top of that the state also decided that online sales don’t count as local taxable revenue. Previously everything you bought online would be taxed and those taxes would go to your local city since you bought it from your city. Now all online sales go to the state because “it’s too hard to track where you really live” apparently. 🙄 we all know how much we spend online. IF lost all that money to the state and lost around 10% (from my understanding) of property tax revenue. This has strangled the cities ability to operate as it has in years passed. The state is to blame and house bill 389 is terrible for local communities. https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/billbookmark/?yr=2021&bn=H0389,t2_9nnwfgd9,TreborsTactics,0,1645812857.0,0,t1_hyery50,hyery50,False,TreborsTactics,t3_t10ajb,https://www.reddit.com/r/idahofalls/comments/t10ajb/city_council_meeting/,City council meeting,/r/idahofalls/comments/t10ajb/city_council_meeting/hyery50/,5,r/idahofalls,0,5

"A poor person already can’t move here with houses at 600k but without the impact tax the people who can afford the house also won’t get Fire or EMS or police services or any local improvements like parks or req centers. I’m pretty sure those new communities want someone to come if their house is on fire. We can’t afford that as a city without an impact tax. The larger a city grows the cost rises exponentially the added tax revenue can’t support all the new infrastructure, add onto that the state stealing all online sales tax from local governments and now 10% of new development taxes we can’t afford to keep the city running let alone growing. Impact taxes exists in every major city in the USA it’s not like we’re inventing some new weird tax. It’s very common for this exact reason. It’s coming, it’s needed, and it’s fair for new residents who come in to pay for infrastructure which wouldn’t be needed or used if they didn’t exist. I won’t benefit from a random road 10 miles out of town or the sewer pipes down there nearly as much as they’ll benefit from down town. I paid for down town they didn’t. If they want roads and sewer at their home they need to pay for it simple as that. It makes no sense for my tax revenue to build a police station that won’t respond to me or fire or parks I’ll never use because I have ones closer. If they want it they need to pay for it.

Most of the new construction that's happening on the outskirts of town is for larger homes that are currently being priced in the $500s and up.

"Congrats on the new job, and welcome (back) to Idaho Falls! You are correct that housing prices have shifted dramatically upwards since you were last here. We're still below the national average, but IF is no longer on the extremely cheap end of the housing market. That said, there's some hope for you.

First, there has been a ton of new construction going on recently, especially for apartment complexes. That should help normalize the rental market a bit, as there's a lot of new apartment inventory that will be opening within the next year. House rentals have long been a little more difficult to come by here - there's a lot more apartments available as rentals than freestanding homes - but I'm confident that you could find a nice place to rent for a while within your $2k budget. More difficult if you really want a house with a yard, pretty easy if you're ok with an apartment (at least temporarily).

For purchases, you should still be able to find a nice home for <$400k. It won't be a brand new, 5- or 6-bedroom place like it would have been a couple of years ago, but I also doubt you need that much space if it's just you and a dog. There's a handful of good-looking homes listed right now in the $300s, and this is by far the slowest time of year for house listings in this area. You'll see *a lot* more properties hit the market come springtime. Keep an eye on Zillow and set your alerts so that you know quickly when something good comes up. Competition remains fierce.

Overall, I'd say that while our housing market remains high, it *has* leveled off recently. I think we're past the worst of it. That said, I think you could still be pretty safe in assuming that a home you buy will continue to maintain its value. The city is growing so quickly that there will continue to be a market at this level. I think the secret is out, and this is just how much it costs to live in Idaho Falls now.",t2_67dwl,oheyitsmatt,0,1645640359.0,0,t1_hy4omvf,hy4omvf,True,geekboy730,t3_szgx7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/idahofalls/comments/szgx7e/housing_options_with_dog/,Housing Options with Dog,/r/idahofalls/comments/szgx7e/housing_options_with_dog/hy4omvf/,2,r/idahofalls,0,2

"I have lived here for four years and have lived all over the USA and even in Europe, in large and small places.  

IF is okay.  I am liberal and there are liberal people here, but certainly it's not the dominant mindset.  The diversity isn't great.  The food scene is definitely improving, as is the downtown.  Shopping isn't super great but the major bases are covered.  The mayor and city council have worked hard to improve the city.  Taxes are reasonable, utilities are reasonable (Ammon may be different).  The politics of  the state are depressing AF sometimes.

The good: sunny, close to Yellowstone, dark skies good for astronomy, river greenway, low humidity, interesting views and terrain.

Bad: very windy, poor medical care, poor airport, limited shopping/grocery, few interesting restaurants, no diversity, no/limited night life-town shuts down at 9pm on Saturday night, many traffic lights-6 mile commute took 20 minutes mostly due to sitting at all the traffic lights.

"I grew up in IF and I didn't realize how lucky I was until I moved away.  It's the perfect size medium city with plenty of amenities (shopping, restaurants, etc.) but not too big or crowded.

Outdoor activities are plentiful with the tetons/Jackson hole to the east, Island Park/Yellowstone to the north, and, for the rugged outdoorsmen, the sawtooths to the west.  There are a couple nearby ski resorts as well.  They're not as big as the Utah resorts but that can be a good thing and the snow is great.  Idaho Falls the city itself doesn't have mountain views (sits in the middle of the snake river plains) but the river greenbelt is pretty.

If you like boating, there's a great reservoir just outside of town (ririe) and a Bear lake a couple hours south.

Salt Lake City is only about a 3 hour drive to the south for large city amenities like a major airport, concerts, pro sports, etc.

Climatewise, it is going to be a lot colder than Mobile. It's pretty windy year round which can make the winters excruciating (and even the fall and spring are kind of cold and windy) but the summers are way nicer than other places I've lived.

"I looked at all the fiber ISPs when I got fiber two years ago. Qwk  .net has the best deal for $49. Top tier speed among all the providers, 1gb up and down, but also UNLIMITED data, no setup fee, no contract, net neutral. I read someone else had a bad experience but it's been great for me. I pay significantly less for fiber now than I paid for Cableone internet.

**For example,** our internet went out for a couple of hours last year. The problem wasn't QWK's fault, it was caused by another company in SLC (I think). QWK fixed it themselves ASAP, but they still apologized and gave every customer $15 CREDIT on our next bill.

Yeah, $15 isn't much, but I've never received money back from any ISP in the 28 years I've had internet service for an outage.

The growth won't happen in Idaho falls anywhere . There is no more room to grow besides the desert on the westside and you'd be a fucking fool to live out in that tundra..and the Iona Ammon area has room but not that much room .. it will be outlying cities like Rigby where they have tons of room to expand. Eventually tying into Idaho falls. This is the same thing that happened in the Salt lake valley in the 60s and 70s .. have all these little cities to combine one big metropolis . By then there won't be a native Idahoan left here cuz we all fuckin hate the growth. Californians are really a cancer. Idaho falls was one of the most affordable places to live 5 year ago and now we are on the list of most unlivable because the wage is sooo low compared to the housing prices ..thanks to all the dickheads from Cali Washington Oregon Nevada and so one .. all liberal shitholes. And ya know how we know  how y'all aren't that smart .. cuz they run from these horrible policies and then vote for the same shit on the next place they go .

The great thing about the west side (which I consider west of the 15) is that it has a high population of site workers who are transplants. It’s not super densely Mormon like Ammon. The people are generally well educated & pretty chill. 

Some Ammonites are under the impression that it’s cheaper to live outside of IF. When you factor in things like utilities- it’s not. Also, when it comes to taxes, you get what you pay for.

Personally, I've got Fybercom 1gb/1gb for $9.99 and I haven't had any problems.

I've had them about a month now, which is not a lot. Their speeds have been consistent if not a smidge latent, but I chalk that up to living in a rural area. The only problem I've had was their technician installed the modem and ran an Ethernet cable outside that failed after two weeks.  He didn't see the problem I pointed out (which I found from me using an Ethernet tester so I knew exactly what the problem was). So I ended up replacing the cable myself and now it works fine lol.

Other than that, I waited a really, really long time to get it installed. Nearly a month and half of living in a home with no internet. Their customer support was less than helpful. Always vague comments about when they'd be out to add a modem outside, claiming they were waiting on their subcontractor to splice my fiber and never a date for when I could expect it other than telling me that they typically expect at most two months for it to be completed.

Went smoothly once checked in. United forgot to transfer our ticket to Delta so that was a mad rush this morning. Only downside, our bags are still in Denver.

The first rep I had on the web chat offered us January 5, I left it and tried calling and then the mobile app help before doing the web chat again and got a great person to help. Took them a bit to look but they got it booked it for us and gave us a hotel room and meal coupons for the night. Try again to see if they will just get you all the way to Idaho Falls on Delta.

"Pilot shortage. \~9% of flights nationally got canceled. The weather is not awful.

The same thing happened around thanksgiving. My sister had to drive my aunt from Idaho Falls to Boise. Three days of no flights and the earliest one could be scheduled was 5 days after that. Needless to say, no one in my family chose to fly again for Christmas.

"Planet Fitness monthly rates are about $11 /month with tax, $39 for a yearly fee, and running a special for $1 down.

I'm making an assumption you attend CEI? If so, I compiled some info on offers and discounts they have with the student life office. If you don't attend CEI, you can look up the college name + gym and see what they might offer.

Idk Anytime Fitness' monthly rate or yearly fee (not available on their website), but they are offering a $1 down special right now, and according to the discounts page for CEI, you can get 10% off whatever their monthly rate is for being a student. 

The CEI web page also offers two monthly gym memberships you can pay for at the school in the student life office, and one of those is bodifi for $15/month.

It's a bummer they don't offer weights classes or have their own gym for free to use.

"I would recommend making a photo album of pics showing her in every way possible. Including pics of the side profile. Including pics that give a realistic picture of body proportions. Here is the link to the other photo on EIN. They posted both the Instagram-style photo and the Drivers license photo. The two don't look the same to those who have never met your cousin. Family members can recognize each other from a simple caricature drawing, strangers can't. Strangers need significantly more details to recognize a person.

[https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/12/idaho-falls-police-trying-to-locate-missing-woman/](https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/12/idaho-falls-police-trying-to-locate-missing-woman/)

I think you can apologize for posting the unflattering pictures AFTER she is found, better to increase the chances she is recognized now. 

\----

There are six types of faces—Oval, square, round, diamond, rectangular, and heart. This photo shows an exaggerated Heart shape. Her driver's license is an obvious example of an Oval face.  The ""heart"" shape to the face is doing her a dis-service if it doesn't represent her actual facial structure. It might be flattering, but it will significantly decrease identification chances if it doesn't capture the facial structure correctly. 

I am inclined to believe the driver's license photo is the most accurate facial photo, as those photos are purpose-made to capture facial structure for easy law enforcement identification. But with only two photos to work from I am not sure.

I am not trying to be rude or unkind. Almost all family members do this when a loved one is missing. They post the ""best"" pictures they have. While family members can recognize someone in an Instagram-style photo, most people who have never met them before wouldn't recognize them on the street from that photo alone.",t2_81cte,Justiful,0,1640594428.0,0,t1_hq4l3l8,hq4l3l8,True,[deleted],t3_rom0ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/idahofalls/comments/rom0ok/long_shot_i_know_please_keep_an_eye_out_for_my/,"Long shot I know, please keep an eye out for my cousin.",/r/idahofalls/comments/rom0ok/long_shot_i_know_please_keep_an_eye_out_for_my/hq4l3l8/,5,r/idahofalls,0,5

"Hi, I work at the NNL. There are several companies that work at the INL location, including the one that runs the NNL and Battelle Energy Alliance, which is the predominant INL company (kind of confusing, sorry). There are pros and cons to each, but my impression is that Battelle Energy Alliance is starting to be more competitive than NNL. But I have not worked for BEA.

As for the clearance, yes, it takes a while. Our newest employee took about 4 months from offer to start date, but we have one employee in the clearance process that is almost at 4 months from the offer date and we still haven’t heard that the clearance was completed.

"We moved about 3 years ago for a job. It's fine. The problem is that the city and the county are pretty obviously behind the times in a lot of ways. We are currently looking at moving away, cost of living has absolutely exploded and wages have not kept up. People can be pretty judgey if you aren't a super Republican or LDS, and are extremely wary of folks from the outside. We do like the family community, but since we are from the outside world, it's a bit hard to fully enjoy it. In terms of shit to do... good luck.

"Well here is my take on the winters.  

Honestly they aren't as bad as they once were.  We used to be below zero for weeks with tons of snow back in the 2000s.  Now it's much more mild.  Many might disagree on me on this.  

We used to have snow through the end of October into March and sometimes April. I can rember trick or treating with a foot of snow. We would definitely have alot of snow by December.  I can remember when it would get to -20 and beyond! Sometimes to -35.  

Now we don't get any significant snowfall until mid December.  The temps don't really drop below zero as much as they used to.  If they do, it doesn't go much further then -5.  

After mid December we get mild to medium occasional snowfall.  But sometimes itl warm up just enough that some melts.  This doesn't mean we don't get black ice and drifting snow though. It also doesn't mean you won't need a snow shovel or a snow blower. The roads also get pretty bad.  It's just nothing like the 2000s.

Once January hits, the temps get as low as they will get.  Lows from -8 to 20.  And occasionally warm spikes.  

After February, winter is pretty much over.  There might be some snow storms here and there but the snow will melt after a few days.  

I've heard that it gets pretty bad in St. Anthony though.  But I never go there so idk for sure.  

That's my perspective ☺️.  Probably more info then you needed but I felt like sharing.",t2_19kogecv,brock4822,0,1638687470.0,0,t1_hnaq6be,hnaq6be,False,Many-Marionberry8733,t3_qwuwdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/idahofalls/comments/qwuwdd/the_official_first_day_of_winter_in_idaho_falls/,The official first day of Winter in Idaho Falls is when this statues water features freeze.

"I just wanted to add to the thread I started that I do not recommend adventure orthodontics. 

They are very knowledgeable and the front desk is friendly and quick but they definitely are not cheap and the orthodontics aren’t too concerned about you as an individual. 

The staff are great for the most parts but the orthodontists did not seem to be interested in helping me explore options or take into account your circumstances. When I told one that I’d be moving within a year and a half he laughed out loud (not kindly) and then said we’d better get a move on.

For those that are interested from mse for them just know that they kept calling it marpe and when I asked about it they said that they are all the same type of expanders. Which if you’ve done your research, you know is not true. It does seem like they use mse as they said they had even maxillary bone expansion but I did not trust them enough to continue on with them.

"We moved to IF from California for a more relaxed pace and to get into the outdoors more. The outdoors are beautiful there but if you're not in the church it can be hard to fit in.

"Porky Korean is awesome. So far I've had the daeji bulgogi, the galbi, and the bulgogi Philly. All have been great. If I lived on that side of town I would be eating there all the time, but it's a little out of my way for lunch on most days.

The Cuban Table is also excellent. I've had the mofongo, the Cubano, the croquetas, and the empanadas. All are great, but the croquetas are the real standout to me. Really amazing, and unlike anything else in town.

I haven't been to Mama Fla's yet. I bought a bunch of their stuff at the farmer's market, including their gnocchi, pesto, and pasta salad. Loved all of it. I've heard some mixed reviews of the actual restaurant experience while they iron out some of the kinks, so I'm giving it a little bit before I go in.

Hokkaido Ramen in Snake River Landing is , in my opinion, fine. I've had a couple of different ramen bowls, all of which were ok. Not bad, but I'm not clamoring for more like I am with other places. I've also had a couple of the appetizers, which *were* disappointing. That said, your mileage may vary. My sister is a vegetarian with limited restaurant options in town, and she's been back here a bunch of times since they opened.

Two new coffee shops recently opened in or near downtown. The Egyptian just opened on Park Street, in the space that used to be Pop's Ice Cream. The Nice Spot recently opened across the river on Lindsay Blvd. I've had fine lattes from both, but I think the atmosphere at each is a little off. The Egyptian only has a handful of small, uncomfortable tables, but they also may not be done getting set up yet. The Nice Spot doubles as a kitschy gift shop and doesn't open until 9am, which isn't really helpful for morning coffee runs. They both keep longer evening hours than other downtown coffee options, which is a plus.

There's also been a ton of new fast food options opening recently in in the area around Sunnyside & Hitt. Mo' Bettahs is a regional chain serving up Hawaiian-style lunch plates. Super Chix does good chicken sandwiches, frozen custards, and the like. Jersey Mike's is a sandwich shop. Wingstop, as the name implies, does wings.

Upcoming, the place next to Lucy's is going to be a Rib & Chop House, a Montana-based steakhouse chain. I'm also aware of Revolution Burrito, a burrito place opening soon at the corner of Pancheri & Utah. Looks like an independent place following a Chipotle-esque model of burritos, Tex-Mex bowls, etc.",t2_67dwl,oheyitsmatt,0,1638213174.0,0,t1_hmkd3wr,hmkd3wr,True,rietveldrefinement,t3_r3ls66,https://www.reddit.com/r/idahofalls/comments/r3ls66/talk_about_new_restaurant_options_at_if/,Talk about new restaurant options at IF?,/r/idahofalls/comments/r3ls66/talk_about_new_restaurant_options_at_if/hmkd3wr/,3,r/idahofalls,0,3

Mama fla is pretty good on some things and not so much other things. I like their fresh mozzarella salad but they use fake bacon bits in the other ones which just doesn't work. Alfredo sauce is heavy on butter and not so much cheese. I chalk some of it up to growing pains.

Porkey Korean is awesome. They make their own kimchee.

"I don't know anything about Part 1 but I worked at the Idaho Falls Fred Meyer for almost 14 years from 2007 until a few months ago. I moved around a lot in the company looking for more hours and better pay scales. I pushed carts for 2 years, cashiered for 2 years, worked the sales floor in home for 2 years, two seasons in tree lot, 2 years in fuel center, 2 years as an home sectionhead and I finished the last 3 years as the overnight freight lead in home.

I loved my job for the first almost ten years when it was Fred Meyer. A few years ago they transitioned to using their parent company, Kroger's, rules and everything went down hill. They intentionally understaff to save money, they keep people at 23.5 hours a week to avoid giving benefits, and the seem to be pushing out the older, journeymen employees in favor of seasonal and temporary help. 

The pay is respectable (I finished around $15), the benefits are good enough considering how cheap they are. I thought I had depression and anxiety but really it was the toxic atmosphere at my work. I make $2 an hour **less** at my new job and I still would never go back to Fred Meyer unless my life literally depended on it.",t2_1abyce1,Blowtorch89,0,1637617367.0,0,t1_hlov9fs,hlov9fs,True,[deleted],t3_qzvrvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/idahofalls/comments/qzvrvr/a_job_that_i_can_work_from_home_on_my_computer/,A Job that i can work from home on my computer that doesn’t requiere anything but a high school diploma?,/r/idahofalls/comments/qzvrvr/a_job_that_i_can_work_from_home_on_my_computer/hlov9fs/,5,r/idahofalls,0,5

"While I agree with your overall message that it is up to these businesses to provide compensation and working conditions that are attractive to today's workforce, I do take issue with one point you made.

There's a fourth option you don't mention, which is that many people - especially women in lower-paying jobs - have simply exited the workforce. Childcare costs are sky-high, and many families recently discovered that they can make do on one income if they're not paying for childcare. Many of the jobs that are having the hardest time hiring right now, like restaurant servers and office admins, are jobs that 1) are disproportionately held by women, and 2) don't offer the flexibility to be at home with children. If you're spending most of your paycheck on childcare, you don't need that childcare if not for going to that job, and you have enough income to cover your other expenses, why bother?

"Three foster kittens in need of loving homes!!!!!!! 

These three angels came into the Idaho Falls Animal Shelter feral and terrified of people. Now, about a month later, they are ready to find their new best friend!! First three photos are of Cilantro, a chunky little lady with quite a lot of spunk (and the CUTEST round ears). She’s a hunter at heart, and I always find her bouncing around playing with almost anything she can get her paws on (Fully vaccinated and dewormed). The next three are of Rosemary, who has always been the tender hearted princess of the group. She was the most open to human interaction even from the first day I had her, and is a sucker for butt scratches and cuddles with someone she trusts (Fully vaccinated and dewormed). Finally, we have Sage, the only boy of the trio and a very handsome one at that. Sage can be seen cuddling with his foster brother Caspian in the first photo, so he would do really well with another male cat (but not required). He’s come the furthest of the three, and has gone from cowering in his bed 24/7 to accepting kisses, cuddles, and even belly rubs! Those little brown eyes will melt anyone’s heart for sure (Fully vaccinated and dewormed).

"Coming from a person who was in RI and moved here I can give you some advice on apartments.   


If you do select an apartment that is cheap you want to inspect it before renting. Looking over the rental agreement carefully and have someone who is experienced with rental documents look over it as well. I don't know how bad landlords are here, but I have had my fair share of slum lords and gotten out of that kind of situation.   


You could also do a room mate situation. I recommend doing just as much of an interview of the room mates and finding out who and how they are before renting with them as in any room mate situation you will eventually butt heads at one point or another. If sharing utilities/purchases for the house you need very clear boundaries in order to prevent being taken advantage of.   


Lastly: Know your landlord/tenant laws. There should be a landlord/tenant handbook you can look up.

He never sent a pipe and plumbing professional he sent his friend that does landscaping to put a bunch of fans downstairs ignoring the slow leak. He rejected my request regarding rent stating ""that's how he pays for the work"" but both of us have insurance on the home.

"Dash and violet are two of the most loving and most gentle hearted kittens I’ve ever met, and they’ve been looking for a home for weeks now. They had an incredibly hard start to their life, suffering from upper respiratory infections, a broken tail, ear mites, and more when they were brought into the shelter. I took them home to give them around the clock care, and I was immediately struck by how special these two are. Violet is a little angel, with her fierce love for butt scratches and her habit of giving kisses, she can make anybody fall in love immediately. And Dash is her perfect sidekick, with his different colored eyes, aloof and dorky personality, and obsession with cuddles at every possible moment. I wish I could pull the person reading this through the screen to meet these two, because they’re everything anyone could want in a pair of kittens and they deserve to have a forever home.
