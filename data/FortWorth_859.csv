"According to Karl Marx groups will form (classes) with common interests, history, and tendencies. These classes will naturally be antagonistic in one way or the other towards each other in various ways. However due to the power and influence a particular class has over other classes will determine whether the class is ""oppressive"" or being ""oppressed"" with the ""oppressed"" being extorted by the ""oppressive"" classes. It's classic class struggle. Historically the only ones to benefit are the political entities from the ""oppressive"" classes that act the ally of the ""oppressed"". It's really just the oppressed continuing to be manipulated. 

You see these concepts being echoed to this day. Only instead of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie you might hear the classes being divided by the color of their skin or gender.

"I know what is partially being referenced by republicans but CRT is technically the incorrect term to describe it. Some of my history teachers within FWISD taught us history from their perspective that everything was systemically racist, and tons of other ""isms"". I would not have thought much of it if my US History teacher  was seemingly neutral but he constantly bashed religion and mocked religious people, along with ridiculing students who questioned him, and he also had a poster of Che Guevara in his classroom, and constantly spoke about a need for a revolution. So from personal experience I do know for a fact that some teachers teach material from a purely revisionist and potentially heavily biased perspective. Although, CRT does specitically refer to a particular university-level field of study. 

There are also people here who may deny this [US is systemically racist] is never taught but that is untrue. Maybe it isn't promoted by the school districts but it is definitely taught by some teachers. I still remember when my english teacher tried to encourage us into becoming vegans by having us watch and write essays on vegan documentaties lol, this is unrelated although many times there are not ""challenging"" students' perspectives if it is the de facto information being taught from agendas teachers want to push. 

I think both sides are wrong on here (sorry leftist redditors - you all aren't neutral on this). People on the right are misusing CRT, whereas people on the left are pretending like it never occurs. Revisionist history has its own flaws (e.g. not applying equal criticism, or presenting theories as factual occurences). Overall, that US history teacher was the most obnoxious in his seeming agendas, I had another one who was biased but presented multiple perspectives, the rest taught us revisionist and previously taught US history. We had assignments on supporting views that we did not shsre to understand different angles. Along with discussing current events. 

I still remember an English teacher who pushed most of our class into protesting and joining the hyped up Kony 2012 movement, along with trying to encourage students to stand up against other things like racism and protest. She said that she would send permission slips to parents and take students to downtown so they could put posters everywhere (Got canceled after the founder was naked in public from a mental breakdown).

"No, you're being very vague. CRT is an umbrella term for intersectional politics involving race, which has its roots in Marxist style classism. Some curriculums across the country are teaching kids concepts like ""oppressed"" and ""oppressor"" classes and where they fall, systemic racism, intersectional politics, and being conditioned to believe they're being oppressed or are unknowingly racists. It's understandably resisted as it's essentially propaganda. Keep it in the fringes of higher education where it belongs. The concept is flawed to being with. You don't condition out racism by teaching kids to be racists. 

When people are resisting CRT they aren't talking about Japanese internment camps, civil rights, or slavery.

"Yep. Not sure if he is the true Republican strategist behind it, but the face of this has been Christopher Ruffo after his initial challenge to Trump to get rid of ""CRT inspired diversity training"" for federal workers. 

The whole point is to create an outrage to drive Republican mid-term turnout. The republicans always come up with some ridiculous straw man after they lose control.

What is new and different about this one is how they have been willing to actively throw schools and children under the bus. Not that Republican strategists had a lot of respect for education generally, but I've been shocked at how overt the exploitation of children and their schools has been for a power grab.

But Republicans haven't had a lot of success with privatizing schools - which they see as a necessary response to desegregation - likely frustrating their investor-donors. creating this amount of distrust of public schools amongst their base is likely an opening move to further erosion of them.",t2_11t7wx,jediwashington,0,1648248573.0,0,t1_i24judm,i24judm,False,yosemitebison,t3_tnmu8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tnmu8p/north_texas_superintendents_say_uproar_over/,North Texas superintendents say uproar over critical race theory in schools is a Republican “manufactured crisis”,/r/FortWorth/comments/tnmu8p/north_texas_superintendents_say_uproar_over/i24judm/,4,r/FortWorth,0,4

Trustees are expected to negotiate an exit agreement with the superintendent at their March 29 meeting, according to an agenda. The school board is also expected to determine how its superintendent search process will look.

During the search for Scribner, the district used the firm Ray & Associates. The process took over a year to find a permanent replacement after then-Superintendent Walter Dansby left in 2014.

"I hear what you're saying, because I used to think like you. I used to think Rand Paul would make a good president. I used to be a Republican.

The problem is that it's all lies and political theater. There are a few Republicans left, like Mitt Romney and Adam Kinzinger, who still believe their party's own propaganda. But they're a tiny minority. As a whole, the republican party is a fascist organization.

Fascism can be a bit hard to describe, because modern Fascists rarely describe themselves as such anymore. But the politics of fascism are rooted in the government of the ancient Roman empire, under the Caesars. Modern examples of fascist government can be found in Mussolini's Italy, and the radical conservative ideology of Otto von Bismarck.

Fascism is concerned with populism, ethno-centrism, militarism, and minority rule. Fascism is hostile toward democracy, and primarily concerned with using propaganda to redirect the wealth of the nation into as few hands as possible.

Libertarianism is just Rand Paul's personal preferred theater to achieve that. He's not the only one.

His opposition to John Brennan as CIA director had nothing to do with policy, and everything to do with the fact that Brennan was nominated by Obama. Again... populism.

"Agreed.  But legal remedies are going to depend on whether or not the people who currently have bookings and have placed a deposit are affected by the new/updated/recently published policies.  


If a same-sex couple already has a wedding booking and has paid a deposit, then the venue needs to honor the contract or refund the deposit.  They may even be on the hook for more damages than just the deposit.  


But an opposite-sex couple can't cancel their booking in protest and demand their deposit back, because the new/updated/recently published policy doesn't affect them.

This March, at 70 years old, she missed an election for the first time. Stewart didn’t forget; she applied for a mail-in ballot, her preferred method of voting for the past five years. But the ballot never came, and she was turned away at a polling place on Election Day.

“They told me I could get a provisional ballot, but I will not be able to get mail-in ballots for the rest of the year,” she said.

Stewart is physically disabled and uses a scooter to travel. As executive director of REACH, Inc., a Dallas-Fort Worth resource center on independent living, she’s intimately familiar with the ways in which disability can complicate normal life tasks. Using mail-in ballots has enabled her to vote in past elections without having to navigate inaccessible polling stations.

But a new voting law passed by the Texas Legislature last year has made voting by mail increasingly difficult. An analysis by the Associated Press showed that about 13% of all mail-in ballots cast in the March 1 primary were rejected. In Tarrant County, 8% failed to pass muster.

Stewart’s mail-in ballot woes are emblematic of a larger voting accessibility problem across the state. Changes to rules governing voting assistance, wet ink signature requirements and the removal of drive-in voting have all erected new barriers for people with disabilities.

“I was so mad when I got that letter (rejecting my ballot),” she said. “I thought, ‘Darn it. You can’t prevent me from voting.’”",t2_ciwuwdza,fortworthreport,0,1648215376.0,0,t1_i22acre,i22acre,True,fortworthreport,t3_tnm3cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tnm3cu/theyre_taking_us_backwards_tightened_regulations/,‘They’re taking us backwards’ : Tightened regulations interfere with voting for people with disabilities,/r/FortWorth/comments/tnm3cu/theyre_taking_us_backwards_tightened_regulations/i22acre/,2,r/FortWorth,0,2

"The Chase one is good. Capital One has a similar which is also good. 

If you like to check bags I would look at either of the AA (Barclay or Citi) or the Delta (Chase I believe). They will give you free checked bags and better boarding. If you fly out of Love then the Southwest I’ve heard gives good friends fly free type perks. I don’t fly out of Love so I’m unsure. 

* I didn’t look up the names of any of the cards. All of the programs give multiple tier. The one that you want to start with has a $100 annual fee. On all of the ones with that fee you will get between 50-100k bonus points for spending either $3,000 or $4,000 in the first 3 months. Some of the CC will waive the fee for the 1st year. After the 1st year I normally cancel the card or go to the lower tier free card. Points from the airlines are often a little more valuable than Chase/Cap1 which is where they will give you more bonus points.

"How the heck is Rand Paul considered a true fascist? He's literally fighting against government over reach every day. Fascism is a form of government that uses force to suppress opposition. 

Paul held a 13 hour filibuster against the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director specifically due to his support of drone strikes against non military/combat targets. American citizens were killed by drones under Brennan's term without trial. 

Cruz is a fairly staunch conservative but he doesn't wield any military power. He can't order drone strikes against George Soros, he can't even get the IRS to audit him. He can get on Fox News and talk about how much it'd cost to mandate non gender restrooms at every business across the country or how bad it'd be for the economy if we wiped out all carbon based fuels. That however is not fascism. 

Gosar and Blackburn are representatives, they represent their voter base very well. Politically they have almost zero power. I don't really know much about either but I'm surprised you didn't add Lauren Boebert or MTG to the list since they are way further outspoken.

"I've got some explanations in the thread already that that is not what they are doing. They are non wedding cancellations by people holding non weddings events, in which they had LGBTQ+ members as part of their event before the policy change, who no longer wish to patron a bigoted establishment, or canceling out of protest to the policy. 
Like large parties or other non weddings events in which some of the guests may be LGBTQ+


The venue refuses to do same sex weddings and does not take deposits for them. 

The owner is saying only certain people will get refunds, and that she has done them for ""situations like this"" but won't for some people, and while she didn't say it explicitly, she has denied refunds for people using the LGBTQ support as the reason for the cancellation saying they attack her, despite some screenshots of conversations being shown and the offended party was extremely polite.


She is probably entitled to keep deposits for these cancellations, she's just being really weird and dickish about it, seemingly rubbing it in the faces of LGBTQ and their supporters that she'd happily refund anyone who isn't them. 

Now she is blacklisting vendors that have anything to do with any group leaving negative reviews, even if the vendor themselves is uninvolved.

"The cancellations are in protest to the new policy, so really ""she's only enforcing her contract of non refundable deposits"".  Which is common.

She's just being a bitch about it and saying she only refunds certain people. 

She is not however keeping the deposits of same sex couples. They refuse same sex couples outright. I don't want to spread misinfo that they booked a bunch of gay weddings and then kept the money without doing them. 

They are refusing other event refunds being cancelled in reaction to the policy change, which seems like her right to do, she's just still an asshole and a bigot.

"Fort Worth is big and diverse and hot in the summer and less hot in the winter (sometimes downright cold). Sometimes there's ice. If you're from the North don't make fun of the Texans when it ices. No one can drive well on ice and the cities don't have the equipment to deal with winter weather. Plus most of the time it will be gone in a day or two. 

Housing and everything else isn't as inexpensive as it once was, but it's still cheaper than some other areas. There are a lot of great restaurants. There are some great local artists (music, dance, theater, painting, etc). There are some great museums. The zoo is very cool but don't go during Spring Break, especially on Wednesday. For future reference, most schools' spring break is the week of St Patrick's Day. I have no idea why but someone mentioned that to me once and it's true almost every year. You should spend some time enjoying all of these things. 

Dallas is over to the East. It's big and farther away than you think and has some awesome stuff and we still make disparaging comments about it. It's a thing. Do it in good fun and don't worry too much about it. 

Some of the roads have tolls. Go ahead and get a toll tag and then complain about how much the toll roads cost.

The main airport is in the middle of the metroplex. It's called DFW. If you are flying Southwest, do not go to that airport. Go to Love Field over in Dallas. If you are flying another airline, check to make sure you know which airport you are flying out of before you get on the shuttle bus at the parking place. If you screw this up you will not be the first person to do so but it's going to be hard to make your flight unless you decided to get to the airport really early. 

There are sports teams here. People get very excited about them. If you don't get excited about sports it's easier just to keep quiet. But you should experience a Friday night high school six man football game in person at least once just because.",t2_yr0wf,gt0163c,0,1648173901.0,0,t1_i20hxqw,i20hxqw,True,Terrible-Camp2445,t3_tmq8in,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tmq8in/moving_to_ft_worth_after_graduation_what_should_i/,"Moving to Ft Worth after graduation, what should I know?",/r/FortWorth/comments/tmq8in/moving_to_ft_worth_after_graduation_what_should_i/i20hxqw/,9,r/FortWorth,0,9

"The 2/3rds vote of state legislatures is an alternative method to call a constitutional convention to propose an amendment, not the satisfactory vote of the state legislatures required for ratification. 

And ratification is absolutely a vote in the literal sense, as without 3/4ths of the state legislatures ratifying the amendment (or state constitutional conventions, which may be used instead of a legislature vote if the state so chooses), the amendment does not become a part of the constitution. It's not a ""formal acknowledgement"", it is a requirement for implementation. All implemented Constitutional amendments have been ratified by those methods. The 21st was the only one to be done so by the state constitutional convention ratification method, the rest with the more normal state legislature vote. And it's not 6 proposed amendments that have failed, but rather 6 that made it past the initial proposal requirement that have failed; there have been over 11,000 proposed constitutional amendments, most of which have obviously never made it to the 2/3rds proposal vote by Congress or state legislatures.

"A Fort Worth City Council map with two strong Hispanic majority districts emerged March 23 after an eight-hour meeting marked by high emotions.

The council advanced the map to a formal council vote March 29. The map is designed to create an opportunity for a second Hispanic representative to join the council and meet the goals of Hispanic advocacy groups, although advocates have expressed displeasure with the final map.

Map X Version 3, renamed Anna, with a horseshoe creates a new majority Hispanic district with a total Hispanic voting age population of nearly 59%.

The map of choice was hard fought by proponents of a strong Hispanic opportunity district. The selected map creates a partial southside Hispanic majority and combines the neighborhoods of Rosemont and Worth Heights with other Hispanic neighborhoods to the east.

“Our goal was to create some kind of horseshoe with a Hispanic opportunity district,” Mayor Mattie Parker said at the conclusion of the meeting. “We have achieved something pretty notable today, so I’m proud of y’all.”",t2_ciwuwdza,fortworthreport,0,1648145772.0,0,t1_i1ymedo,i1ymedo,True,fortworthreport,t3_tmsw14,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tmsw14/after_yelling_accusations_and_tears_fort_worth/,"After yelling, accusations and tears, Fort Worth City Council arrives at a redistricting map￼",/r/FortWorth/comments/tmsw14/after_yelling_accusations_and_tears_fort_worth/i1ymedo/,2,r/FortWorth,0,2

"I don't disagree with that at all, in fact despite often being non-partisan campaigns most Texas city mayors are moderate/centrists and Democrats or Democrat adjacent. 

Parker's switch is likely going to depend on endorsements and campaign funding, she has had backing of Price and the Bass family in the past and like many establishment figures they are closeted moderates who are Republicans. 

The cities are overwhemingly progressive and the state is statistically blue but gerrymandering, voting restrictions, and the appointment system on the state level has allowed the GOP to not just stay in power but also double-down and veer even further right-wing. It has also forced more and more Dems in vulnerable seats to posture toward the middle, a middle which is more right-leaning than it was in the past.

"Doesn't really change the fact that ""cant get elected in Texas without and R next to your name"" isn't really a factual statement. 

Tarrant County voted for Biden in 2020 and Beto in 2018. Fort Worth is very much a big city and with that typically comes a shift toward the Democratic Party. The idea that only Republicans are going to get elected, especially at a local level, is simplistic and asinine view.

Considering what Mattie Parker said in the interview, I don't think it would be shocking if she switched and ran as a Democrat next year. I don't believe doing so precludes her from being re-elected.

"Centerpoint area, driving on highway 183 headed east, turn right onto South bound 360, then take that first exit. Turn left at the light and go under 360.  There are all varying levels of income in this area. It goes from really spooky looking cheap a** hole in the wall to very nice, well tended apartments and grounds. My daughter loves it in this area and it's a 4 minute walk to the train station. Give the area a really good one over. My 32 yo doesn't drive and this area with restaurants and shops, with a train to boot, (Huzzah!) has worked out great for us and her! I'm all about public transportation since my daughter has epilepsy and has never driven. 
Good luck and please DM me with any questions. I've learned the DFW area really well due to trains and busses.

Edit: sorry if I was repetitive with info, replied before reading all. Downtown Fort Worth is great as well.

There are condos close by as well but they get really expensive. You have plenty of options thanks to mass transit, pretty much anywhere with bus service is going to use that location as a hub.

"How do you propose taking part (or all) of the income billionaires have? An overwhelming majority of their money are running through the economy via investments. Are you referring strictly to their disposable incomes? I understand the frusteration with mismanagement, although city resources are not synonymous with private property. Note: I may be misunderstanding you here, although I am commenting with the assumption that Sundance Square is privately owned and funded via The Fine Line Group (owned by the Bass family), and you are referencing such as belonging to ""city resources."" 

Unless people want to forcibly reclassify whatever they deem as seemingly public on an arbritary opinion - this could be extended onto others outside of just billionaires. I am referencing Sundance Square in this particular context. 

I understand billionaires have tons of influence and power, although there are alternatives to taking their money away because people dislike it (regardless of  opinions). Billionaires should be persuaded by the public into investing into socially conscious businesses and communities, and donate their precedings respectfully. Tons of old money - and consequently families with old money, did not have awareness of corporate social responsibility and other newer business models such as a stakeholder view (whereas the traditional and more common shareholder model seeks to maximize profits). 

The reason why billionaires have seemingly uncontrollable wealth, goes back to their investments that tend to continously grow due to returns. City investments may also experience growth, but it will never be on the same scale as making high-risk/speculative investments in other areas outside of actual city property. Seizing large swaths of firms' cash flows from billionaire's investments would amplify other issues, and ironically - diminish the overall returns a city's investments would make.

If anyone says I am defending billionaires - no, I firmly believe they should be heavily scrutinized and deserve countless criticisms, although they should be pushed into social awareness of communities and the effect they have on peoples' livelihoods or in this case - the heart of the city. There should also be laws requiring donations from these people (to charities, communities, cities, people, etc.) with oversight of potential conflict of interest, etc.  As much as people may want to bash the Bass Family, downtown Fort Worth could have easily been overlooked for other projects. 

I do hope that people make the Bass family aware of their discontent with certain members destroying the core of the city.",t2_802xe4bd,ChaoticHelios,0,1648038308.0,0,t1_i1sbczw,i1sbczw,False,fortworthreport,t3_tk4pan,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/tk4pan/book_it_heres_why_fort_worths_central_library_is/,Book it: Here's why Fort Worth's Central Library is for sale,/r/FortWorth/comments/tk4pan/book_it_heres_why_fort_worths_central_library_is/i1sbczw/,-2,r/FortWorth,0,-2
