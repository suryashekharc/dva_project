"good job! but some constructive criticism... Vegas is a large part of Nevada for sure, and I hear the ringing of the slots reflected in the song.  but there's a lot more to reflect on in the state so I think you should go a little deeper. The trap beat doesn't really distinguish itself as ""Nevadan"". You can keep it electronic while still adding elements of western, vastness, and other descriptor ideas. Give it another shot, and keep it up!

also, since you're young I have a word of advice. the older generations are over the ""I tried, so free props"" mentality.

"University of Salzburg. It says it in the paragraph right before the expense allowance. You can also see it in the link ""...sbg.ac.at..."" which is the official domain of University of Salzburg (sbg = Salzburg). I am surprised you didn't see the paragraph, since you copied part of the informed consent right before and after that part. I don't know though, where the comment has gone in which you cited the consent since I'm new to reddit (as you are correctly mentioning). 

To your other questions: confidentiality can be ensured because prior to being allowed conducting, this research had to go through the equivalent of IRB (Institutional Review Board) in Salzburg. To get IRBs approval I had to sign a letter of confidentiality which makes me personally reliable for any misconduct or ethical violations.  In the informed consent there is even an official email address and link a person can contact, in case they think I violated regulations. You could btw. sign up to this study with an e-mail that does not include any information about you as a person. Additionally, when the data is collected in the following two surveys, they are anonymised by the participant generating a code. This way it is not possible for me to link any data to an e-mail address submitted.

Apart from that, I had to hand in a twelve page application form informing IRB about every detail of the planned study. Not only obvious topics like overview, ethical considerations and targeted population. But also lit review, methods and statistics. The entire process of getting the approval took me 5 months. This is actually quite fast, considering the IRB meets once a month and you have to hand in everything at least two weeks prior to their meeting. Where it gets really messed up, though, is, that IRB takes at least one week to review your application. If they have any complaint, your application gets rejected and you have to hand in a revised application. This leaves you with one week to change what ever they objected to or else you have to wait another six weeks for their next meeting. 

I hope that answers your questions. If not, please let me know.

P.S.: I realise that this isn't really something you would consider ""hard"" evidence. But I hope you understand that any ""hard"" evidence I would provide is connected to me as a person. And since we are still in the wondrous internet, I'm cautious when it comes to that. But you can gladly contact the e-mail address that is connected to the survey-link :)",t2_iwj7nekz,6_education,0,1648279481.0,0,t1_i262bmo,i262bmo,False,6_education,t3_tnsyr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nevada/comments/tnsyr0/academic_study_in_sexual_psychology_1835_nevada/,"[Academic] Study in sexual psychology ""18-35; Nevada residence""",/r/Nevada/comments/tnsyr0/academic_study_in_sexual_psychology_1835_nevada/i262bmo/,1,r/Nevada,0,1

"Reno-Tahoe Odyssey will be the best experience if you can find a group. I noticed you’re doing this for all the states and if you’re trying to do something spectacular, this is it. You will probably end up doing more mileage than you are asking but it will be worth it if you can flex your recovery schedule.

The Silver State 50/50 in Reno is also a well know course and they have options outside of the 50 miler/50k. Beautiful views and very competitive and fun running community behind this one.

Escape from Prison Hill is one of my favorites in Carson City. It’s a good amount of elevation gain so you get incredible views. It’s competitive and well know in the running community but, it’s also very fun and a lot of people dress up. 

The Red Rock 10 Mile Challenge is a good one in Las Vegas. It’s also a great time of year (Mid October) since most races are very late spring/summer heavy. I also hear good things about the Rock’N’Roll Marathon.


I’d give you Tahoe suggestions but you might get a lot of that from the California group.

"She’s not wrong. Ordinarily we would like to see competitive districts but when one half of the politicians act in good faith to create competitive districts while the other half act in bad faith to give themselves an advantage, you end up trading good faith politicians for bad faith ones who want to run the government in order to cripple it and waste everyone’s time and money. 

Our politics have become a prisoners dilemma. Cooperation would yield the best outcomes for both sides but when one side chooses to act in bad faith, they end up outcompeting the good faith politicians. What’s the solution? One side has to wipe out the other. The problem with that in our case is that the GOP doesn’t know what to do once it catches the car. We saw this under Trump. Another tax cut for the wealthiest, more dogshit and culture wars for everyone else while government is neutered and dismantled. The GOP strategy is political nihilism. Which sucks for everyone who can’t afford to buy a house or travel at will. That’s most of America an in particular, most of the GOP.

"Totally agree that waiting till you have 20% to put down is not necessary.  For a first time home buyer, you can put something crazy like only 3% or 3.5% down.  You'll need to pay PMI in the range of $150-$300 per month until you have 20% equity, but that means (a) you get to start putting money into your mortgage instead of rent many years sooner since you don't need to save up for years to get to that insane $100k down payment, and (b) if the value of the house goes up you benefit instead of needing to pay for it when you can finally afford the 20% several years into the future.  Generally, the PMI is worth it in terms of getting into the house sooner and at a lower price.

Often new homes price the upgrades into the upfront cost, not necessarily just into the total price of the house.  So to get 50K in upgrades you may need to fork over an additional 25k or so at the time of closing.  Each developer is different but definitely look into that.  15K for closing costs is pretty reasonable.  Specifically compare the lender you choose for closing costs because that can vary a lot from lender to lender.  And, seriously consider whether you should use the lender and title company that the developer asks you to use.  It is your legal right to pick the lender and title company you want, and developers often have their own company act as the lender and title company which just means they make more off of you.

So, in sum, you could probably buy the house with $50k-$75k depending on how the upgrades get charged, up front or just tacked onto the total price tag and built into the mortgage.",t2_89nf2,existenjoy,0,1647897722.0,0,t1_i1kxy7l,i1kxy7l,True,Iscratchmybutt,t3_tizlwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nevada/comments/tizlwn/how_much_would_i_need_to_save_to_buy_a_nice_house/,How much would I need to save to buy a nice house in Henderson?,/r/Nevada/comments/tizlwn/how_much_would_i_need_to_save_to_buy_a_nice_house/i1kxy7l/,1,r/Nevada,0,1

"You have subscribed to Exercise Desert Rock facts! 😃

I believe this was my quote source:

https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_Rock_exercises

This was the source for some of the other facts mentioned: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/590299/atomic-soldiers/

Wiki article: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Rock_exercises

YouTube footage: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MOismCI5er4

And an excellent, excellent old government video: https://archive.org/details/ExerciseDesertRock1951

This video shows exactly what they wanted to say: soldiers should have no fear of atomic arms and should continue battle without concern - “with confidence.”

The text posted with that video …

>In 1951, the Army, working with the Atomic Energy Commission, carried out the Desert Rock Exercises, an experiment to ""dispel much of the fear and uncertainty surrounding atomic radiation and the effects of gamma and x-rays.""

>A tent encampment was set up about 27 miles from where the atomic explosions were detonated on the Nevada Proving Grounds. The encampment housed about 5,000 Army soldiers, civilian observers and technicians. Troops spent hours in classes receiving training in radiation and nuclear weapons effects.

>The following is a recorded interview between a sergeant and a training officer prior to a blast:

>Question. ""How many of your men would volunteer to go up and be in the 
foxholes?"" (one-half mile from ground zero)

>Answer. ""I guess about half a dozen.""

>Question. ""It's quite a loud noise when that bomb goes off ... would it do 
them any harm?""

>Answer. ""No sir, not the noise, no.""

>Question. ""How about the radiation? Do you think there is much danger?""

>Answer. ""Radiation is the least of their worries that the men are thinking 
about.""

>Question. ""I think most thought radiation was the greatest danger, didn't 
they? Where did they learn differently?""

>Answer. ""They were, prior to our instructions here. We received a very 
thorough briefing.""

>For the Desert Rock I Exercise, the weapon was fired as an airburst. The majority of the troops were out in the open about seven miles away. The soldiers were told to crouch down and face away from the blast. The bomb flash blanked out the troops from view, and the flash was followed by blast winds and the noise of the explosion. Interviews with soldiers were conducted after the test.

>Following the test, the troops were trucked toward the stationary military equipment used for experiments. The experiments were set up one-half mile and also at three miles from the blast. At three miles, the gun emplacements and military vehicles were undamaged, but at on-half mile damage was moderate to heavy.

I have no special knowledge but a solid general interest. I live in Nevada and have visited several test sites and seen a lot of the exhibits in city and county museums. (The main test site area is still restricted although I believe some informational tours were available for a few years.) “Nevada Proving Grounds” became the “Nevada Test Site” until 2010 when it became known as the “Nevada National Security Site.” No tests since 1992…. but a Russian politician suggested using the site to demonstrate Russia’s nuclear arms in the midst of the Ukraine war, so there is that.",t2_fqzk9,Pjpjpjpjpj,0,1647827547.0,0,t1_i1ha830,i1ha830,False,pchandler45,t3_tis8oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nevada/comments/tis8oa/color_footage_of_nuclear_test_in_nevada_1950s/,Color footage of nuclear test in Nevada 1950's,/r/Nevada/comments/tis8oa/color_footage_of_nuclear_test_in_nevada_1950s/i1ha830/,7,r/Nevada,0,7

">Desert Rock was the code name of a series of exercises conducted by the US military in conjunction with atmospheric nuclear tests. 

>They were carried out at the Nevada Proving Grounds between 1951 and 1957.

>Their purpose was to train troops and gain knowledge of military maneuvers and operations on the nuclear battlefield. 

Testing battleground tactics in an atomic  exchange. Using the movies to train other troops on tactics that work, and to persuade them that there is nothing to fear.

"Is being in possession of a federally issued ID required by law? Owning a gun, getting on a plane, requiring a student ID - these are not on the same level of someone's right to vote.

"No, that’s not voter suppression. Not any more than having to show an ID to get on a plane is suppressing someone’s right to interstate travel.
Or showing an ID to buy a gun is suppressing someone’s second amendment right. Or requiring a student to show an ID is suppressing their right to a free and appropriate education.
Your argument would not meet basic consistency comparison with a thousand other examples.
Being a person who has lawful status to cast a vote in this country necessarily means that it is lawful to verify whether someone is a person who has lawful status to cast a vote.

I know that you understand my arguments. How do I know? Because I know that if vote fraud tended to favor Republicans instead of Democrats, you would be pounding down the doors to make ID mandatory.  The same way Democrats highly encourage illegal immigration from South American countries, while literally at the same time very harshly blocking and rejecting illegal immigrants from countries like Cuba where the immigrants tend to vote Republican.

"We moved to Summerlin just less than 5 years ago. We specifically chose one of the most expensive subdivision due to the brand new elementary school that was just opening. The Principal was the #1 Principal for CCSD for many years and he hand picked all the teachers to bring with him to the new school. We were excited to be part of the brand new school with the best admin and teachers. Our son started kindergarten in the very first year and everything was great. Now he’s in the 4th grade and I can’t say the same. Some of the biggest issues you’ll find with CCSD is the classroom sizes and lack of good teachers. My son has 34 kids in his 4th grade class. It was mostly online learning in 3rd grade, but he had 28 kids in that class. 5th graders are pushing 40 kids. That’s a lot of kids per teacher for an elementary school. 

Last year was a one off due to the pandemic and online learning. But 4th grade has been a huge challenge so far. My son isn’t learning as much as he could be due to the classroom size. I’m finding myself teaching my son the entire material because he’s not learning it in class. Luckily, I work from home, but he likes doing his homework before dinner because he loses focus after dinner and it’s hard to stop working my business for 1-2 hours to teach him math. 

My sister’s a Principal in a different state that also ranks very low in education and when I tell her about these issues, she can’t believe how bad it is here, especially for my school that’s brand new with the best of the best. 

Yes, constant budget cuts are making it extremely difficult to provide the resources for our kids, but our school can raise money like there’s no tomorrow. A few year ago, our school had announced on Friday that they have to raise $53k in less than 10 days due to budget cuts. If they couldn’t raise the full amount, he would have to cut a few teachers. He had over $100k in donations. What baffled me though was that last year when we had 100% online learning, we had 4 PE teachers. Like WTF!?!?!?

I just finished listening to an audio of a book by Fanny Kelly in the 1800s. She was taken by the Sioux indians.

There was one arrest for voter fraud in the state that I'm aware of, a man claiming someone tried to vote in his dead wife's name (turned out it was him that did it, plead guilty to a felony. D'oh!).

"I often find that people say they want to move to Henderson because they are looking for a small town/suburban feel. Usually they saw Henderson listed on some roundup of best small towns next to larger cities. Or they just don’t want to say they live in Las Vegas. 

While you will find that different neighborhoods and different master plans provide various lifestyle options that suit people in different ways, there is really no difference between Henderson and any other area in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. 

The Clark county school district serves all of Clark county: Henderson, North Las Vegas, Las Vegas, and rural cities outside the metro area. 

Summerlin (not Summerland) is a very, very large master planned community on the opposite side of the valley from Henderson. 

There are for-profit private schools, nonprofit private schools,  religious schools, and charter schools in all areas across town. 

The property taxes on residential homes here are stunningly low compared to most other places, and this provides a stunningly low budget for the public school systems to operate on (although it’s always unfair to compare their spending per student to regions where they are performing maintenance on 100-year-old education facilities). (Maybe that’s what you’re referring to when you say “pretty good for being on the west coast” ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

"This is untrue and propaganda by the Bureau of Land Management and the local ranchers. They claim the horses cause ""destruction"" to the natural brush areas but the cows grazing on BLM land do not? It is really all about the ranchers who many have relatives working at BLM because there are many out of the way offices, wanting their cows to graze on the land and not the horses because they won't make money on the horses grazing. The BLM has been rounding up and selling horses for ""adoption"" but it has been investigated and these same ranchers are adopting the horses and sending them to Mexico for slaughter and being paid for the horse meat as well as an adoption fee from the BLM. It is a terrible situation. I agree they need to begin birth control measures on the horse and burro program but there is no mention of birth control for the cows that make money for the ranchers. The BLM also use helicopters for rounding up the horses which is unbelievably cruel, horses are scattered and foals break their legs running in fear.

"The sun should be overhead at noon. Time should be symmetrical around the solar cycle in the sky. This seems manifestly obvious. 

It's extremely weird to move the numbers to temporarily trick people into going to work earlier.

Work hours will just move. People don't show up at 8 AM because there's something magical about the number 8. They show up because that's the earliest employers have found they can drag people into work.

Change it so 8 is now permanently 7 (by the sun) and employers will start the day at 9. Duh.

Edit:

Work hours in the US are largely determined by school bus schedules. About 70% of American workers have children under 18.

School bus schedules are based on how far before dawn parents will let their kids stand outside.

Move to Fake Time and the bus schedules will move an hour later, at least in Winter.

"This sucks.  DST is **known** to cause health problems.  Permanent DST makes this worse.

My own guess why this happens is because it forces people to wake up earlier than they normally would.  Other peoples' hypothesis are that it's because it forces you to set your clocks not to your own time zone, but to a time zone one hour east of your own.

C.U. PUTIN'S rage-black face

           ""If *I* can’t have you, Ukraine, nobody will!"" 
 
(Maniacal Laugh O.S.)
 
PUTIN calls the silo. He gives the order to launch missiles toward the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility in Ukraine. 
 
EXT - MIDDAY - ZAPORIZHZHIA
 
A missile arcs in the sky, straight toward the plant. The ensuing explosion triggers the blast that instantly incinerates everyone and everything within the first few miles, blinds those farther away. The cloud rises and buildings begin to crumble. The effect is felt for hundreds of miles. Radiation begins to spread its misery. PUTIN revels. 
 
INT - NIGHT- PUTIN'S CONFERENCE ROOM
 
A feast to die for covers the long marble table. A half-dozen comrades cluster around the food. One man pumps PUTIN'S hand in congratulations, while the rest share silent glances. CONSPIRATOR 1 moves easily toward PUTIN, smiling. He nods at CONSPIRATOR 2, the man shaking PUTIN'S hand, who suddenly wrenches their leader's arm behind him. The other men quickly move in as Conspirator 1 shoves a long narrow knife between PUTIN'S ribs.

"Yup…depends on the neighborhood. When I lived by Summerlin Hospital I would usually find a bark scorpion inside once every couple of months. Sometimes a couple per month. In a neighborhood several blocks away with larger fancier homes it was several per month, sometimes per week. A coworker in that area said his 14 year old son had been stung 3 times in 2 years. Freaked out the first time and spent 6 hours in the ER waiting room… next time vacillated about medical care and the third just shrugged it off. It’s only really dangerous if you are allergic to bee venom, very small or frail, or stung above the heart. Got stung on my calf… don’t want to experience that again!

They’re more common on property with lots of unskinned palm trees… scorpions hitch a ride when palms are imported from Mexico.

However, when I moved to (northern) Nevada 20-ish years ago, I thought there was something really odd about a lot of the locals. Like not wholly 'there', mental faculties also a bit shy, etc. The running joke of consensus up north was that between radiation, and cyanide (from mining) in the water, most folks WERE a little off, prolly a half-gene or so short. Who knows. And I guess I mean, seriously, who knows. I am so NOT a conspiracy theorist but I also know how very little was known about the powerful and far reaching effects of nuclear radiation, in those early days; how toxic a huge area could remain, for generations.

"I lived and worked in Southern Florida for a year. Dry heat like we get in Vegas is absolutely worse. 95 outside in Florida is uncomfortable but 115 outside in Vegas can be downright dangerous. 
The biggest issue is that Vegas is extremely dry. When it is that hot and that dry, the moisture in your skin just sublimates out without the evaporative cooling you get from sweating. Physics being what it is, your body cannot reject heat via radiation when the air temperature is hotter than you are; temperature change goes from hot to cold which means heat gets transferred to you, not out of you. And the ever present wind here only exacerbates these problems by inducing convection.

NRS 484B.208  Duty of driver to move out of left lane when traveling at a certain rate of speed: When required; exceptions.

1.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, on a controlled-access highway which has two or more clearly marked lanes for traveling in the same direction, a driver may not continue to operate a motor vehicle in the extreme left lane if the driver knows, or reasonably should know, that he or she is traveling at a rate of speed which is less than the posted speed limit for that portion of the controlled-access highway and is being overtaken in that lane from the rear by a motor vehicle traveling at a higher rate of speed.

2.  The requirements of subsection 1 do not apply:

(a) To a driver operating a motor vehicle that is:

(1) Overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction;

(2) Preparing for a left turn at an intersection;

(3) Traveling in a lane designated for the use of high-occupancy vehicles pursuant to NRS 484A.460, if the driver complies with the requirements to travel in such a lane; or

(4) Engaged in the construction, maintenance or repair of the highway, including, without limitation, the removal of snow.

(b) When traffic conditions, inclement weather, obstructions or hazards make it necessary to drive in the extreme left lane.

(c) When compliance with an official traffic control device or the directions given by a peace officer makes it necessary to drive in the extreme left lane.

(d) To the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle in the course of his or her official duties.

(e) To a driver operating a motor vehicle within the geographical limits of a city or town.

"Of course much of the ""all Joe Biden's fault"" is political point scoring. However, the Democrat's position on fossil fuels must shoulder some blame here. The left is pushing for a quick transition away from fossil fuels, and they are using policy tools to accelerate this. Why would the oil and gas industry invest in expanding production when once the crisis passes they will be back on the list of industries to be phased out? I personally support a balanced approach to drilling, we have to live with the fact that right now we are heavily reliant on fossil fuels and we need to maintain domestic production to insulate us from Geo-political shocks. It is better for much of this to be done domestically under EPA regulations than shifted to countries with far less environmental regulations. 

We are in the age of over-simplification of complicated issues, there is plenty of blame to go around instead of finger pointing we need to identify long term solutions. In my opinion these are expanded, but responsible use of natural resources and brand new state of the art nuclear energy plants. Of course these do not lower the price overnight, really all that can be done for that is gas tax holiday, but markets are forward looking and meaningful moves in this direction will lower prices in advance of the supply coming online.",t2_15i0fb,rocknthenumbers8,0,1646958169.0,0,t1_i06f0bc,i06f0bc,False,saurin212,t3_t8f57w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nevada/comments/t8f57w/las_vegas_gas_prices_rise_nearly_25_cents_since/,Las Vegas gas prices rise nearly 25 cents since Friday | Las Vegas Review-Journal,/r/Nevada/comments/t8f57w/las_vegas_gas_prices_rise_nearly_25_cents_since/i06f0bc/,1,r/Nevada,0,1

"Sorry if I repeat anyone, but I want to answer before I have to hop off Reddit. 

Tips: NEVER go barefoot in the desert; bring a black light with you to check for bark scorpions; look up pictures of all creatures listed below beforehand; and most importantly, if you ARE bitten, try to get a picture of the animal for doctors to pick the right treatment. 

Anyway, here’s a list:

1. Gila monster: if you see one, give it space; if it bites, it won’t let go; it’s a protected animal, so it’s best to avoid for your safety and its safety

2. Rattle snakes: avoid clumps of branches and such; if you hear rattling, try to find it visually before you move; give a wide distance to go around it; they want to hide, so if they come at you while you try to leave, you’re probably going the direction of its hiding place, so go the other way; common types of rattlers in NV include mohave, sidewinder, Western diamondback, speckled, and Great Basin

3. Scorpions: the bark scorpion is the most venomous in North America, and we have lots of them; it’s sand-colored and almost impossible to see without a black light; children and the elderly are the most at-risk; check your tent with the black light; shake out shoes and clothes before putting on; check your sleeping bag thoroughly before getting in

4: Black widows: they like dark places like piles of brush or rock and rodent holes

"Ziplock bag should be fine. If there are any gaps in your tent closure, you could find critters inside. Try and use a cot if possible and shake out your bedding before hopping in. I don't know if I'd bother with a sleeping bag myself for that time of year but it depends on how you're camping. If it's lightweight backpacking stuff, I might just go with a simpler bedroll. It isn't going to be that cold in the Southern part of the state where you'd need a sleeping bag. 

Rattlesnakes are the venomous snake around here but they want to be left alone more than anything. I've lived here in Vegas most of my life and I've only seen 3 in the wild and have hiked extensively. I'm sure more have been around but I've never seen them. If you come across one, just give it a wide berth. They don't get aggressive unless you have it cornered. If you hear a rattle from one of them. Stop where you are and carefully look around to locate it. Once you do, slowly move away. If you are carrying a walking stick of some kind, you can use that to prod them to move along from a safe distance but it's best to leave them alone. 

All three species of Scorpion in Nevada are venomous but only the bark scorpion is moderately dangerous. The Emperor and the Desert Hairy scorpions have very weak venom and may not even use it. We're talking bee sting levels of pain, not pleasant but only a mild irritation. Bark Scorpions are worse and could mean you need medical attention, and they can climb. Scorpions like dark cool places, so don't go sticking your hands in holes or under rocks. They are nocturnal and will prefer to be out hunting while you're sleeping. 
Spiders are the only other thing I'd be concerned with. We have black widows and desert recluses which are a cousin of the brown recluse. Same thing with scorpions, don't go sticking your hands in places you can't see. Shake out your bedding and bag up your shoes. Both bites can be potentially serious, so keep an eye out. They usually stay near the ground and won't want anything to do with a human capable of squishing them.",t2_2al31tqn,mikmckn,0,1646684466.0,0,t1_hzqwwfn,hzqwwfn,False,Scary-Owl2365,t3_t8x5se,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nevada/comments/t8x5se/are_there_any_venomous_critters_i_should_be_aware/,Are there any venomous critters I should be aware of in the deserts of Nevada?,/r/Nevada/comments/t8x5se/are_there_any_venomous_critters_i_should_be_aware/hzqwwfn/,19,r/Nevada,0,19

"**[OPEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC)** 
 
 >The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC,  OH-pek) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 countries. Founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela), it has since 1965 been headquartered in Vienna, Austria, although Austria is not an OPEC member state. As of September 2018, the 13 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 81. 5 percent of the world's ""proven"" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by the so-called ""Seven Sisters"" grouping of multinational oil companies.
 
**[Mohammed Barkindo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Barkindo)** 
 
 >Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo (born 20 April 1959) is a Nigerian politician. Since 1 August 2016, he has been the Secretary General of OPEC. He previously served as Acting Secretary General  in 2006, represented Nigeria on OPEC's Economic Commission Board during 1993–2008, led the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation during 2009–2010, and has headed Nigeria's technical delegation to UN climate negotiations since 1991.
 
**[2010s oil glut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_oil_glut)** 
 
 >The 2010s oil glut  is a significant surplus of crude oil that started in 2014–2015 and accelerated in 2016, with multiple causes. They include general oversupply as US and Canadian tight oil (shale oil) production reached critical volumes, geopolitical rivalries among oil-producing nations, falling demand across commodities markets due to the deceleration of the Chinese economy, and possible restraint of long-term demand as environmental policy promotes fuel efficiency and steers an increasing share of energy consumption away from fossil fuels.

"People in this thread need to learn about [OPEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC).

 [Mohammed Barkindo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Barkindo) is the secretary general of OPEC. He's the one in control of the global oil markets. USA's oil prices were low due to the [oil glut we created in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_oil_glut).

OPEC is turning down production to run up prices. OPEC did this to us in 2012, but no-one in here seems to remember.

> The world price of oil was above US$125 per barrel ($790/m3) in 2012, and remained relatively strong above $100 until September 2014, after which it entered a sharp downward spiral, falling below $30 by January 2016.
