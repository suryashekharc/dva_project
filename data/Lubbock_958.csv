"Well if your being technical you said you where speeding in your first post so your a liar and an asshole because your so caught up in being correct you will say whatever to make the other person sound like the bad guy.   But yes if you see forcing people to pass on the right your an asshole.  And to be clear I'm not saying your an asshole all the time.  I'm sure you are a wonderful person who cares for and has people that care for them dearly!  I'm just saying in this situation yes you are the asshole.  If there is enough room for people to pass you on the right then you could gave not been an asshole and been out of that person's way.  And I find it funny also that every person that passes you is a speeding maniac who has absolutely zero reason to be in a bigger hurry than you.  So it's your position to try and control these people by making them go around you.  Which is making traveling more dangours for everyone because someone speeding changing multiple lanes is far more dangerous than if they can just pass you going straight.  God forbid anyone ever be in a bigger hurry than you, or have an emergency, or even just being about to shit their pants, they need to do what you want them to do.  See it's the fact that you are going out of your way to make it more difficult on people that makes you the asshole.  You know someone is going faster than you even though you admit to be speeding in the first place.  But you won't get out of the way because it might inconvenience you slightly down the road.  You might have to break for someone else or god forbid move over and let someone in.   

I have no intention of trying to change your mind because I know that's not going to happen.  But just trying to point out that life doesn't revolve around you.  People all are going through different shot and may have more pressing things than you.  That doesn't make them the asshole for needing to be some place quicker than your going.  Like I said it doesn't mean your an asshole all the time it just means you are in this situation.  If you can get out of someone's way that is in a bigger hurry than you why wouldn't you want to do that?  I'm the first to admit I'm an asshole in some situations with what I do as well.  I'm just trying to give you a perspective of what it looks like from the outside looking in!  You keep rocking that asshole middle lane life if it completes you!

The trails at Lubbock Lake Landmark (check their hours, I think they close at dusk) are super-beginner friendly but are not officially bike trails. Great elevation changes and pretty empty, though, and good experience on caliche/loose trails if you're only used to biking on pavement.

"Amazed no one has commented anything yet. Lubbock is pretty calm; nothing too crazy going on. Being a university student, there's a lot more available, especially if you are of drinking age (21). 

Theres the r/THEBAGEL that gives you some information on the happening around town, but honestly your best bet is going to be making some friends at the university to get interested in local events and do some road trips together, in my opinion. 

Palo Dura is a few hours driving from here and is amazing to see. I'm from New Mexico, so I might be biased, but Carlsbad Caverns and White Sands are some incredible sights; that's a bit longer 4-6 hours of driving.

You can get to a few major cities (Albuquerque, Dallas, Austin, El Paso, etc.) with a 6-8 hour road trip.

"I do not know that this is true if you are in a park or somewhere loitering is not really loitering and you do not have a sign asking for tips or donations. A hat on the ground is probably fine. I say probably I have not checked this. This best thing really is to just call the Lubbock Police department and ask. The way the arrest people sponging with signs is they arrest them for advertising without a permit. That is why like Lions Club and the Fire department are allowed to beg but citizens are not. They go to where ever and get approved to get the proper permits from the city. It is not so much the city enforcement that takes issue with the homeless in Lubbock as it is the city business. They all issue no trespasses on their property to the homeless and they get picked up for trespassing when they go into the gas station to buy a water or whatever because the business has told them they are not welcome on the property and they call the police. This is just what I gathered from a year in Lubbock county. All the homeless that get arrested are advertising without a permit or trespassing somewhere they have been warned not to go. And Honestly the vast majority of them trespass on purpose because LCDC is nicer then a shelter. They have TV, it is air conditioned. you can stay all day and you do not have to walk across town to get chow. Also they have books, and free health care if you need to get that gonorrhea cured, and I have heard that since my stay they have added 3 tablets per pod. I had a buddy that came in like one a week for 3 or 4 days by intentionally trespassing at the same Dollar General. The jail is full enough all that happens for Trespassing is you sit in jail for a week at most then they let you out with time served. Or maybe you come back and sit it out once you have a warrant for not paying the fine. Either way as long as you don't create a scene the cops are not going to arrest you for vagrancy. I lived in my car for like a year sleeping at the walmart on Quaker parked on the side facing Applebees and the newer walmart facing the big hill on the north. and one other walmart I can't name by streets. I just moved around so no one Walmart would get pissed I was taking up residency in their parking lot. I imagine it is harder to not get F'd with if you do not have a car. Whatever you do don't park by a park or something. Neighborhood watch goes hard in Lubbock. I slept by a park for a few days and after that neighborhood watch was stalking me for like 2 weeks. I called the cops because crazy old ladies were chasing me around town. lol. I guess trying to make sure I wasn't up to no good but sheesh. High speed pursuit is a bit extreme for Neighborhood watch. I was just working at the only walmart I didn't sleep at trying to reestablish myself in Lubbock so I could finish my last semester of my Mechanical engineering degree without the finacial aid I lost by going to jail. So really its not the Police that suck about vagrancy its the population. I ended up leaving town because of the neighborhood watch. Some dude in a truck kept parking like 2inches off my bumper and sitting there all night like I was about to go on a murdering spree or something. üôÑ Plus the trap house I showered at got a servelance van permanently parked in front of it and I didn't want to go down for some crazy shit just trying to catch a shower. I know it was neighborhood watch because I like paid for that license plate look up thing to find out who the fuck these people were stalking me and they all lived within a few blocks of that park I slept at. I think they thought I was yoinking it in my car cuz I was like under my blanket playing on my phone and some dude came up to my window and pounded on it yelling at me rather aggressively. I just took off and went back to Walmart but with retired old farts with nothing better to do for company. I mean they like went hard. When I first realized I had a tail I like floored it going like 100 in a 30 and like 3 cars took pursuit when I just thought it was one. This freaked me out so I went all Nascar through allys in neighborhoods and shit. Driving around in weird figure 8's until I had lost them. On my way out I noticed one of the cars that had been chasing me abandoned in the center of the road with a blown tire from trying to jump a curb and follow me across a field. There was a cop like directing traffic around it and the driver side door was still open like when their car got disabled they bailed into another pursers car so I wouldn't come get them or whatever. On second though just avoid Lubbock in general. The Christian population will stalk you and the ghetto population will rob you and the college students are in general not that open minded.

Great stop along the way for good cheap meth tho. Lock your car. It is not fool proof as I did and mine was stolen twice. One time whike I was in jail and someone got the spare key from my house and took it.

"WC that‚Äôs me lol those 3 points are things I have complained about before in one form or another. 

Training exists but we don‚Äôt have a ‚Äútraining program‚Äù. It‚Äôs a lot of learn as you go. I‚Äôve complained about that but I have yet to come up with a really good way of fixing it. Shadow and drive like we do is pretty good for broad stuff but I can‚Äôt throw you into a 2 week training course and expect you to learn how to troubleshoot everything, especially the weird stuff. So learn as you go is the best I have for that. 

Documentation exists but it is lacking or old. That‚Äôs something being worked on by your leads currently. And ask me for access to my information! I have a ton of it easily accessible but it‚Äôs in my notes. Just have to request access to it since I don‚Äôt mass share it to everyone. I have it linked to a ton of other information from people much smarter than me. 

No accountability from higher ups‚Ä¶ depends on who you are talking about. Plenty of shit gets eaten by support but other departments/people do seem to be held to another standard.

"Lubbock is really easy to learn. Way easier than most places.

Just go drive around. If you can remember the following, you can get anywhere: where Marsha sharp is, where the loop is, where I-27 is, numbered streets increase going south, and where slide, Quaker, Indiana, and university are relative to each other. 

Then when people say ‚Äúit‚Äôs on the corner of 82nd and Quaker, you know exactly where you‚Äôre going without a map.  At least that‚Äôs how everyone I know gives directions. The closest cross street to a place is usually more than enough to be able to find it. 

Just be careful driving here. The street layout is easy. The drivers are the worst. Pause at green lights, don‚Äôt trust other peoples blinkers, yada yada yada.

"Google's always been an interesting creature.  It insists the South Plains Mall is in a place called Doud and it's completely wrong about the name of my neighborhood.  It, and all the other apps, are really only as good as the underlying data they suck in.  Personally, I use Apple Maps, but they all have their idiosyncracies that you get used to.

For the most part, Lubbock is built on a tight grid with major intersections every mile, with our blocks being wider E-W than they are N-S.  There are major exceptions.  Melonie Park, for example, was laid out by a mouse strung out on acid.  As /u/WTXRed pointed out, our numbered *Streets* generally run East-West, and our alphabetical *Avenues* generally run North-South.  As you travel south and west from 1st Street and Avenue A the address numbers increase.  Travel east of Avenue A and an ""East"" indicator is added to the street name (for example, East 50th St).  Travel north of 1st Street, and our numeric streets turn alphabetical (with a college/university naming convention)

As for street addresses, each 100 denotes a block.  

Some of the roads that buck the naming convention are University Avenue (N-S that should be named Ave Z), Broadway Ave (E-S that should be 12th St, Main St (E-S; 11th St), Buddy Holly Ave (N-S; Ave E), Texas Ave (N-S; Ave I).

There are a few places in town where they squeeze in additional roads mid-block, or stretch out the road naming convention.  These streets tend to have ""Place"" names.  For example, 2nd Place is between 1st Street and 2nd Street.

To further complicate things, you'll hear ""Highway"" and ""Road"" interchanged a lot by locals.  

Lubbock is known as the Hub City because of the state highways that branch out like tire spokes.

"They got a tunnel system that would keep you away from surface level shit such as high heat and might protect you from some over pressure. That‚Äôs what you need to worry about if Pantex is targeted.  Say they are not, the big worry would be from radioactive material brought in by the prevailing winds. I‚Äôm not an NBC expert so take it all with a grain of salt but the winds will bring in a radioactive ‚Äúdust‚Äù, poisoning everything if a detonation doesn‚Äôt occur close. All that being said here‚Äôs a bit to maybe make you feel better. Mutually assured destruction (MAD) is technically still applicable. Meaning that if Russia launches nukes, we launch nukes. This is to ensure that the world is destroyed and nobody has to live in a post-nuclear wasteland. Be basically blow the world up. Maybe some people survive but it‚Äôs doubtful most would. Sounds scary‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ if this were on the table, which it very well may be I would think that we would be hearing about how to survive a blast. This was common during the Cold War, when MAD became a thing. We are it hearing that.
