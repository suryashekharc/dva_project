"Hey hey!  I‚Äôm a real estate agent here in Lynchburg with Keller Williams. I work in Lynchburg as well as all the surrounding counties.  If you‚Äôre not working with someone already I‚Äôd love to chat with you and see what your price point is and make some recommendations on areas that might be a great fit for your family.

There‚Äôs some good advice here.  Not all of it is 100% accurate.  Unfortunately not all sections of Forest are within the county limits of Campbell however, some homes fall in Lynchburg. So if you‚Äôre focused on saving on property taxes it is important to know specifics about where the property sits.  

Campbell and Bedford property taxes are about half that of Lynchburg city, so as others have advised you it is a potentially huge savings to be outside city limits over the long haul.

"Hello! I just graduated from that school!(class of 2021) If I were to be honest it wasn't the best years of my life. Although I am a little bit of a weird one, I still felt a little unwelcomed (mainly in the 5th-8th grade part). The teachers are great and always helped me with any questions or make up work I had. But the communication from the school to parents is sub-par. The best advice I have is to send children for k-4th, since middle school starts in 5th grade, then transfer to public school. Each and every teacher had a great connection with every child, I found teachers asking if my grandmother was ok, if my mother liked her job, and if my father got the project he hoped for. The community is great, the students ok, but that's how students are. I felt the work was unbearable, at least for me getting by with barely Bs.  **I will note that I hear ex-students constantly say ""I was very prepared for high school.""

"I was born and raised in Lynchburg until the age of 33. I now live in Roanoke. I can honestly say that I prefer Roanoke, for two big reasons. 

1. Lynchburg requires a car to get anywhere. It always seemed that the average time to get anywhere, from any place that I lived to school or work, was about 15 minutes. Roanoke is a bigger city but it has more ways to get places and I find my commutes much shorter and more convenient. 

2. Lynchburg may be safer, but it‚Äôs boring. There is nothing to do, once again, that doesn‚Äôt require a bit of traveling to. For example, In Roanoke there are shops everywhere. There are parks and playgrounds galore! This makes Roanoke a much better place to raise a family in my opinion.",t2_3e4y1,thinkfreemind,0,1644446894.0,0,t1_hwafb0h,hwafb0h,True,clawhammerist,t3_so3fgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/lynchburg/comments/so3fgr/lynchburg_vs_roanoke/,Lynchburg vs Roanoke,/r/lynchburg/comments/so3fgr/lynchburg_vs_roanoke/hwafb0h/,1,r/lynchburg,0,1
"Years ago, AEP was one of the cheapest suppliers of energy in the country. That was a major consideration when buying a home or locating a business in this area, as the difference between SSEC and AEP power was considerable.  

While businesses have to make investments, those investments typically come with some level of risk that the invested money might be lost. AEP, Dominion are government approved monopolies. As a result of that privilege, they get a Rate of Return on their ""investments"" that is guaranteed by the State by approving rate adjustments to your bill. 

As such, the utilities are incentivized to lobby hard for approvals on more expensive projects that generate a greater profit then, say maintaining and rehabilitating conventional power plants. This is the primary reason the Electric Utilities don't like you installing your own Solar (they don't get to charge you for that), and why they love Electric Vehicles (more power grid investment .)
 
ELI5: 
$100 investment x10% Rate of Return = $10 annual profit. $110 to be paid by rate payers
$1000 investment x10% Rate of Return = $100 annual profit. $1100 to be paid by rate payers 

Next time you hear about clean energy & the environment, consider if that message is coming from a source actually concerned about the environment, or you're actually being gaslighted

"Having lived in both, I feel like the discussion often overlooks the more nuanced qualities of LYH in favor of the ""big city"" benefits of Roanoke. However, where you spend  your time and the things you value will entirely change your outlook in both cases. 

My wife and I were on the LYH greenway five days a week, when possible. We'd park at a seed trail and use it to go downtown, bike the length of it up and back, take one of the side trails just to see where it ended, sit by the creek, stand on the bridge and look over the river and island, picnic on the island or the Green. Walk up and down the stairs for exercise. The ROA greenway just...depresses me. It's useful for safe biking. It achieved its purpose for marathon training. But I don't really \*want\* to be on any part of it. Roanoke has ""more"" greenway, Lynchburg has ""better"" greenway.

Downtown Lynchburg. Downtown Lynchburg is a healthy, trendy, comfortably bustling place. The Downtown Lynchburg Association supports all downtown businesses, advertises new openings, holiday specials, urges people to shop local, supports the farmers market. The restaurants are varied and modern (for the most part), all have great views, and are trying new things. The rooftop bars are fantastic fancy dates with amazing views. (If you put a rooftop bar in Roanoke I don't know what direction you'd have to face to not be disappointed. Views though.) The farmers market is consistent and well-supported by the city. Roanoke's feels shoehorned in, even though I imagine it's older. Again, Roanoke has ""more"" downtown, but I feel like Lynchburg has ""better"" downtown. 

And for the love of God my wife can walk into every restaurant in Lynchburg and get a passable gluten free dish but Roanoke is a straight up desert. 

Also rapid fire - like four insanely well-stocked beer stores - driving around Lynchburg is a giant circle, driving through Roanoke is a big T - the city is built on a hillside which means everything has a good view - the Parry Restaurant Group - Forest is to LYH as Salem is to ROA, but better - most neighborhoods are walkable/runnable - RPs underground pizza and music scene - downtown events on the Green - very low CoL.

Other people care more about flights, but I'll usually drive to Charlotte for flights anyways. I like absorbing history as I walk the entirety of my downtown. I spend as little time as necessary on Wards and by LU, so they barely register as part of my experience with the city. 

And now that all my opinions are out there, someone's gonna come complain about them and I'll regret posting it, but living in Lynchburg was the best time of my life. On weekends we head up to LYH instead of going to the much closer downtown ROA. One day we'll move back.",t2_6yvwr,CovenantHeart,0,1644424009.0,0,t1_hw8pjsp,hw8pjsp,True,clawhammerist,t3_so3fgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/lynchburg/comments/so3fgr/lynchburg_vs_roanoke/,Lynchburg vs Roanoke,/r/lynchburg/comments/so3fgr/lynchburg_vs_roanoke/hw8pjsp/,18,r/lynchburg,0,18
"Overall I think I still prefer Lynchburg. It‚Äôs not a city you want to be in if you‚Äôre looking for a strong nightlife scene or are trying to advance your career as a young professional and need lots of big companies to try and get into. It is definitely a city geared toward a less hectic lifestyle, raising a family, and having more space. As one other poster mentioned, the layout of Lynchburg is super easy to navigate. Wards Road is arguably the most congested part of the city and even that‚Äôs a joke especially if you‚Äôre from a larger city.

We visit Roanoke often during the spring and summer. It‚Äôs actually a really nice city. But it does have sort of an eerie vibe to it. It‚Äôs hard to explain, you just have to visit. If you‚Äôre looking for more of an urban experience, Roanoke is the better option. We really like the neighborhoods around downtown. Old Southwest I think it‚Äôs called. Great food options there as well.

The biggest disadvantage to Roanoke is it‚Äôs location. It takes longer to get to surrounding cities like Charlottesville, Richmond, and Raleigh, which are all cities we like to visit frequently. However, when you consider the lack of flight options out of Lynchburg, I guess it‚Äôs basically a wash, depending on which travel method you prefer (car or plane).

What I like best about both cities is how (generally) friendly the people are. Larger southern cities like Charlotte and Raleigh have largely lost their widespread Southern Charm, but it‚Äôs still alive and well in Roanoke and Lynchburg.",t2_2rmshax1,ILikeToCycleALot,0,1644418158.0,0,t1_hw8aoew,hw8aoew,True,clawhammerist,t3_so3fgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/lynchburg/comments/so3fgr/lynchburg_vs_roanoke/,Lynchburg vs Roanoke,/r/lynchburg/comments/so3fgr/lynchburg_vs_roanoke/hw8aoew/,9,r/lynchburg,0,9

1) I prefer the layout of Lynchburg. We have our rush our 'trouble' spots of Wards & Timberlake, but those are *nothing* compared to bigger city traffic. I feel like Roanoke is a never-ending traffic jam.

2) I prefer our proximity to other cities of interest - Charlottesville, Raleigh/Durham, Greensboro, Danv...ok not there. :P

But you get to travel easily to major cities if you're into seeing concerts or major-city offerings, so I like that balance.

I absolutely know there are people here who are accepting and allies. I also know there are people who are not. I had a person close to me say they would not consider moving here because they didn't want to be in a place where them holding hands with their same-sex partner would make them feel uncomfortable or like an oddity, and they personally got that vibe from Lynchburg. Like the other comments said, I think there are many good people here. but I did want to share the perspective of a gay person who did not want to live here.",t2_6hn2hj62,AnyGreenCause,0,1643690598.0,0,t1_hv3dqk0,hv3dqk0,True,m3gajoules,t3_shb9nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/lynchburg/comments/shb9nd/interviewing_for_a_job_in_the_area_curious_about/,"Interviewing for a job in the area, curious about the area and environment",/r/lynchburg/comments/shb9nd/interviewing_for_a_job_in_the_area_curious_about/hv3dqk0/,2,r/lynchburg,0,2

"I can't really comment on your specific situation, but as someone who has spent time in multiple hospitals in the state, your comments and the other ones in this thread could be copied and pasted from anywhere. When I was at UVA, a lot of Cvillians said they would never go to UVA, only Martha Jeff for simple things, or Hopkins or Duke for something serious. 

In the specialties I deal with at Centra, just about all of the physicians come from good med schools and residencies and are well regarded. If anything, Lburg has an easier time recruiting desirable physicians because it's a single independent non-profit system. UVA physicians also see Centra patients in some specialties, and I assume that will continue to increase as UVA and Centra have a partnership. I can't comment on specialties I don't interact with at Centra, and I've had zero experience with primary care there (although, primary care generally gets dumped on wherever you are).

"I can't entirely agree with that, Internet in some areas that are included can be bad, I'd encourage more to check before you rent.

I find it funny, yes there's stuff to do in Cornerstone and Timberlake but to me there isn't that much to do in those areas and more to do downtown/rivermont ave (I live there). But to be fair, I don't really care to drive to cornerstone/timberlake unless I have to.

Businesses downtown/rivermont are open late (midnight, etc.). Also you mustn't go out late to those areas cause it's def not family centric after a certain hour lol it's just a regular place to go get drinks and hang with friends or make friends :)

Another option might be a battery operated trail camera, if you don't have internet but can visit the house periodically to check the pictures (actually, neither blink nor wyze need internet to record either; just if you want remote access to the footage).

A lot of 5G is marketing, but if the phone you are thinking of buying is already 5G-capable, it just means your phone probably will be ready when they do flip some of the switches to go from marketing to actual noticeable performance.

In its current state, 5G is almost always about bragging rights, but a phone that has 5G also has 4G and it‚Äôll work great.
