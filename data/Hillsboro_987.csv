"I have a story. My dad disappeared. We were all fearing the worst. He's not doing well. He's a cancer survivor. He weighs about 100 lbs soaking wet. He and my mom had an argument about money and he just took off. This is extremely unlike my dad and we were all terribly worried that he had gone off somewhere and ended his life. We hadn't heard from him all day. I called the Hillsboro PD because the last time he was seen was at my home in Hillsboro. My parents live in SW Portland. I had an officer come out to my house. He talked to me. He was extremely sensitive to the situation and he told me that even though technically it should be Portland PD jurisdiction, he was going to put in a call and get it transferred out here. He told me they would put out a BOLO and to keep him in the loop if anything changed. My dad finally surfaced, thankfully, but I was very appreciative for the way that the Hillsboro PD took my family emergency seriously and went out of their way to help me.

BDSM Brewery, Hillsboro's newest beer haunt, sets up shop in residential garage  
Geoff Pursinger January 12 2017  
The brewery is planning to open a proper retail location soon.  
HILLSBORO TRIBUNE PHOTO: CHASE ALLGOOD - Billy Wing, owner and brewmaster at BDSM Brewing, has been thinking about opening his own bar since he was a teenager. The brewery plans to sell to local gay bars in the coming months, as well as set up a retail space in Hillsboro.  
HILLSBORO TRIBUNE PHOTO: CHASE ALLGOOD - Billy Wing, owner and brewmaster at BDSM Brewing, has been thinking about opening his own bar since he was a teenager. The brewery plans to sell to local gay bars in the coming months, as well as set up a retail space in Hillsboro.  
  
Hillsboro's only gay bar isn't quite what you'd expect.  
  
For one thing, it's located in a garage on a tiny cul-de-sac in southern Hillsboro.  
  
The BDSM Brewing Company officially opened its doors last month, but while it looks for a permanent home, the brewery has been running quietly out of the home of its owner and brewmaster, Billy Wing.  
  
""Our neighbors have been super supportive,"" Wing said. ""We've already had a few people who found us, including our first regular customer.""  
  
The bar, located at 2256 S.E. Oak Crest Drive, isn't able to sell beer until it receives its license from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. Instead, Wing is giving it away for free, at least for now.  
  
""We're brewing more than we can drink, so it's time to start giving it to the public until we can sell it.""  
  
The brewery does sell merchandise to help cover costs, included T-shirts and glassware. When they get set up in a commercial space —— which they hope to have accomplished next month.  
  
CHECK IT OUT  
What: BDSM Brewing Company  
  
Where: 2256 S.E. Oak Crest Drive, Hillsboro  
  
Hours: 6 p.m. to midnight, Wednesday through Saturday.  
  
More info: BDSMBrewing.com  
  
The brewery's suggestive name isn't quite what it appears. Officially, the brewery is Billy's Damn Straight Mash, Wing said.  
  
The names of the beers on tap are also likely to raise eyebrows. With names like ""The State of Submission,"" it isn't the sort of brewery you'd expect in suburban Hillsboro, but Wing said that he doesn't see the name turning people away.  
  
""I'm not worried that people will be so wigged out that they don't want to try the beer,"" said Wing, 41. ""Even if they sing all the hymns in church and button their shirts all the way up, we all have a level in us that giggles at George Carlin and a level of obscenity that makes them laugh. The names of the beers are comedic, suggestive, but they're just an entendre. And you can take two, they're small.""

At the end of the day, Wing said that his brewery isn't meant to make people feel uncomfortable. ""The idea is to keep it inclusive to everybody,"" he said. ""We don't want our brewery to be anything other than inclusive to everybody. I want to try to and maintain that classic 'Cheers' feel. It's just a funky brewery with a funky name.""  
  
Wing and his husband Matt had been homebrewers for years, and Wing said it was always his dream to open a bar.  
  
""BDSM Brewing was born out of a Craigslist find,"" Wing said. ""We went from hobby to profession that fast.""  
  
After upgrading their equipment to make larger batches of beer, Wing realized that their small homebrew operation had grown to the size of a small brewery.  
  
""We were a fully functional brewery,"" he said. ""Just by luck of the draw.""  
  
Wing said he was drawn to open a bar in his hometown because it fills a need in the area.  
  
""One of the first things we noticed is that Hillsboro doesn't have a gay bar, and there hasn't been a classic need for one until Portland's rental crisis started forcing into Hillsboro. The city is growing at an amazing rate.""  
  
Wing has big plans for his beer, saying he plans to start selling to bars as soon as possible.  
  
""Hopefully by spring you'll be able to find our beer in every gay bar in the Metro area,"" he said.  
  
As one of the few LGBT-owned breweries in the state, Wing said that it's important that his business give back to the gay community any way that it can.  
  
""I want to do something nobody else is doing. Nobody has ever gone to the gay community and said 'I'm a gay brewery. I make gay beer and I want to sell my beer to you,'"" he said. ""We want to help the community who helped us so much in our own growth process.""  
  
Eventually, he said, he'd like to see the bar expand to locations in Portland.  
  
""Or maybe I'll open up a leather bar in Beaverton,"" Wing joked. ""Just to scare people.""  
  
BDSM Brewing is open from 6 p.m. to midnight, Wednesday through Saturday.

"Thre is a wonderful nonprofit called the Feral Cat Coalition. They will be able to help you, whether or not the cats are feral (wild and cannot be touched) or tame-ish. 

[https://www.feralcats.com/](https://www.feralcats.com/)

What they probably will want to do is for you to rent some traps from them (they give a 100% refund) and have you trap some and bring them in, as many as you can trap at a time. They MAY be able to have some volunteers help you, may not - depends on so many things. They will spay or neuter each cat you bring in. You pick the cats you brought in that morning at the end of the day and hold them in your garage overnight, then you can release them. And you just keep doing this until all the cats are fixed. 

As for animal services, for any tame, pregnant cats, you can call Bonnie Hays Animal shelter - it is a no kill shelter - check the web site first to see what they recommend. They can check all the tame-ish cats to see if there are chips.",t2_g4j2q,jcravens42,0,1647639775.0,0,t1_i17gw9e,i17gw9e,True,loverov,t3_thepsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/hillsboro/comments/thepsj/stray_cats_or_a_colony_need_help_with_them/,stray cats or a colony??

"Angela Swan, PRSG Volunteer Coordinator here :)

To answer a question I've been getting frequently - The time commitment to become a core volunteer is truly up to you, but typically, your family will need 2 - 3 hours per week at the beginning of your relationship.  We ask that interested volunteers are able to commit to at least 1 year to avoid re-traumatizing the family.  There are other ways to get involved with PRSG if being a core volunteer doesn't work with your lifestyle/schedule at the moment.

The orientation tomorrow is from 6 - 7 via GoogleMeet, and there will be another one specifically for people interested in becoming a Core on the 15th.  It's important to attend the general orientation first to get a good overview of the  journey of a refugee, resettlement agencies, and how PRSG fits into the big picture.

Numbers above the beer stations would help with the lines. Myself and other waited to find out the line we wanted was the one next to us.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

"I just started a few months ago (also Shift 1) and I personally love it so far. Granted I work at the smaller Factory across town, which I’ve been told D1 can be a very different environment, and the obligatory “It depends on your department.”

Great work environment, real personal relationships with people across the Factory (although that probably comes from being a small site), and honestly nothing to complain about for work life balance.  

As a salaried employee, you are obviously payed to do a job, not for a specific amount of your time every week.  (With that said, there is an expectation that you are there to cover your responsibilities during your shift hours, so don’t go too crazy with that, like I’ve seen some people do).  

I’ve had some busy weeks, but I rarely am expected to work a significant amount over the Shift 1 hours, and have had weeks where as long as we’re getting everything we need done, we’ll get a couple hours back.

The highway is still too busy to drive on at a slow speed or stop repeatedly on, especially during the day.  Speeds of 50 mph and over work fine.  It also is constantly going uphill and downhill, so I couldn't get a steady rpm and speed simultaneously, which was needed for some steps of one of the drive cycles I was doing.   Even though the highway still wasn't completely ideal, it's likely the best place around for drive cycles.

I did find a nice area off the highway called Timber Rd. It worked for driving at slower speeds, and stopping and going, but still only worked well in the middle of the night.  It had a lower speed limit and wasn't busy, but still had the occasional car.  It exited back onto the highway, which was very nice. 

I don't feel like we completely met every requirement of every drive cycle we did, but we did our best. We might have succeeded at meeting every requirement on the very last drive cycle only.  After all this though none of my monitors that were incomplete before ended up registering.  I brought my car in to the mechanic and he didn't find anything wrong.  So now I'm selling the car.",t2_31nu0ss3,ClayMask01,0,1645021058.0,0,t1_hx6awsx,hx6awsx,True,ClayMask01,t3_sgwcbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/hillsboro/comments/sgwcbm/where_can_i_find_a_place_with_no_stop_signs/,"Where can I find a place with no stop signs, traffic lights, a speed limit of at least 55 mph, and no traffic during the day?",/r/hillsboro/comments/sgwcbm/where_can_i_find_a_place_with_no_stop_signs/hx6awsx/,1,r/hillsboro,0,1

"Cloth masks probably help a bit on the margins relative to nothing, but they really don't help a ton.

The only [randomized control trial on cloth masks](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9069) to-date suggested that a 29% increase in cloth mask usage in a community reduced cases by 6%, though this difference was not statistically significant (surgical masks faired a bit better). Of note, this was conducted before either Delta or Omicron.

OP -- it appears based on your comments that you are relatively risk-averse on Covid (this is totally fine!).

"I don't disagree. I have volunteered at a few high school sports events this academic year. And repeatedly had to ask ADULTS to put their mask on. It was just plain awful. And it was always the same people.

You could tell they were getting satisfaction from it. If I had to do that every day as a new part of my job, I'd passionately hate it. I hate confrontation. 

But I don't place the blame on grocery store employees that are there to stock shelves and work the checkout line.

"The virus can't be stopped, it can be slowed down. We did a pretty good job slowing it down, now vaccines are readily available everywhere. Anyone can get one. The current strain omicron is weaker than previous mutations, with higher vaccination rates we should see less hospitalizations than if the vaccine wasn't  available. We are in an endemic, the media isn't calling it an endemic, but this isnt ever going away. It will continue to mutate, and be around for years to come. It's similar to the flu in that regard, you will need vaccination updates yearly.  Listen I agree masks are good, and we should all wear them still.

"\>>he said Hillsboro is taking homeless people and putting them up in hotels with no stipulations. No required sobriety or oversight and no input for the community.

Um.... not exactly.

In May 2021, Washington County announced it had plans to turn a motel in Hillsboro into the county’s first year-round shelter for homeless and other at-risk groups. The county received $6.2 million from Project Turnkey to purchase the 60-room Econo Lodge Inn & Suites at 622 S.E. 10th Ave., according to an April 22, announcement from the nonprofit Oregon Community Foundation. The foundation is administering Project Turnkey.

[The article that reported this](https://www.koin.com/local/washington-county/hillsboro-motel-to-become-year-round-homeless-shelter/) also noted that Washington County’s programs have included offering hotel vouchers to at-risk people with medical conditions, contracting with another Hillsboro hotel to create a respite shelter for vulnerable people who test positive for COVID-19.

I'm on all of the various county agency Facebook pages, and they \****regularly***\* ask for community input.

"* Having hydrophobic treating (sometimes called weather/waterproofing) on your car/glass does wonders.  It gives the ""water that 'beads' up"" making it so it more easily removed from your windshield is a huge plus in reducing glare.

* If you just turned on your car, make sure you warm up your windshield the same you would with snow.  If your windshield is foggy it increases glare.

* I have astigmatism which is notorious for creating beams of light.  For this I have anti-reflective corrective lenses that help minimize it.

My solution is 100% of the time I drive in the day I wear polarized clip on shades over my glasses.

Tell him you have him on camera and unless he wants to go to jail and have a record you don't want to see him near your place. Or call the cops. Problem is if you do that he is going to get arrested. Probably not going to do that much time, then know exactly who got him in trouble.

We got our solar from encore. I was stupid enough to not take any other quotes. But towards the end of the process i felt like ours was a bit expensive.

"I'm having an 8.5kw system installed by Tesla. I went with Tesla after getting several quotes from local installers. Local installers were about $3.20/ watt. Tesla is $2.00/watt without a battery. Tesla also has financing available as part of the process. Most installers direct you to outside financers that often have large fees. 

Tesla has great installers, but really slow process. I began back in September and my install date is now May. Contacting them during the process is also difficult and slow. They will do some sizing changes I hear but they pretty much just offer pre made sizes. 

As for warranty, they have the same warranty most companies do. Something to consider is that many of these companies that tout the 25 year warranty have only been in business for a few years. Will they be there to honor the warranty? Who's going to climb on the roof to fix it if they are out of business?  

It's a bit of effort but I really found the system advisory module really helpful in putting numbers to all this.

"My husband and I have tried to negotiate increases several times and failed every time. Corporate landlords don't care and don't seem to mind the cost of finding new tenants. Even when we've been great renters (no complaints against us, rent always on time, considerate of our neighbors, quiet and low-maintenance) the increase seems to be non-negotiable. There was a point during the start of the pandemic when many people were moving back to live with parents or otherwise exiting apartments and there seemed to be a short-lived drop in pricing that coincidenced with our lease renewal. It still didn't matter. 

The last time it happened, we moved to a place with better amenities that came out to be the same as the increased rent we were being told to pay, but we at least got more for the money. Yeah, it cost us to move but the better quality of life has been worth it.

>In May of 2020, Portland police executed a search warrant on the house and seized the defendant’s devices. He admitted they would find four images and videos depicting child pornography but claimed they were not for sexual purposes. Mr. Cunningham was charged in Multnomah County for possession and duplication of that child abuse material.

>In addition to the four images and videos the defendant acknowledged, investigators also found a photo the defendant took of a student using the restroom at Orenco Elementary School in Washington County. The photo depicts intimate areas of the child’s body and is taken from an angle such that the defendant would have to be hidden from view when he took it.

This would be a Civil suit at best and will cost a lot to get resolved, if at all. You could attempt a complex-wide rent strike and hope a friendly Judge rules in your favor at the eviction hearing. They have a lot of leniency to force compliance on issues that are not covered by the above laws.

"There’s multiple reason. But the most recent issue is the USPS stopped delivering our mail in October claiming that our property management needed to redo the boxes. 
Now I’m January, I’m still having to go to the post office on the other side of town to get our mail even tho new boxes are installed. 

Come to find out, usps says they redid the mailboxes but property management didn’t do it to ADA compliance and they’ve been basically sitting on it and fighting with usps instead of fixing it. 

The post offfice is only open during normal business hours for mail pick up ( as most of us also work normal business hours) 
For me to get my mail, I have to take time off work. It takes 20 minutes EACH WAY to drive there and the line usually takes 30-60 minutes. 
So me, and others, are losing 1-2 hours of work each day we want to get our mail which for me at least is a decent chunk of change. And the complex refuses to work with the USPS or the tenants. But they raised our rent the 9.9% allowed for 2022 first thing in January claiming “ market rates” is the reasoning for the rent increase. 🙄

"I’m sorry you, random internet person, are the receiver of this, but I’ve about HAD IT with people “ don’t that have insurance?” 

THATS NOT THE FUCKING POINT. 

Yes, there’s insurance to cover the building and inventory. But insurance doesn’t cover lost wages. Insurance doesn’t cover most of these (small, independent, family owned, businesses) now loss of complete income. 

Insurance doesn’t pay for relocating. Insurance doesn’t cover the blood, sweat, tears, and sacrifices these family’s have made to have a store in downtown. Insurance doesn’t cover the sadness our citizens have for seeing a 100+ year old building, that holds significant history, gone. 

Insurance will make sure there’s a new building there. 
And that’s about it. 

For these affected business owners, they lost everything. To them, their house just burned down. 

I’m a small business owner in hillsboro. Family ran. My father works there. My wife works there. If the building I’m in were to burn tonight, we would be FUCKED for months. If not years. 


Why is it so hard to just fucking help people when a disaster happens instead of “ well insurance should oh for that”

"County code requires any renovated space to be brought up to fire code which would include fire suppression systems where applicable. 

My office was a block from here in the old hardware building and we had to have retrofitted sprinkler system before we could move in.

The trouble could be 3 different issues:

* The arcade wasn't renovated enough (or recently enough) to require being brought up to current code

* The arcade wasn't required to have fire suppression by current code (being several separate ground level units) even if it was a new building.

* The fire suppression was in place but could not reach the initial fire area (likley no outdoor sprinklers in the covered walkway) which allowed the fire to grow to the roof where the sprinklers would have been underneath the fire and not done any good anyway.

Regardless of the first two, all the pictures and video during the fire looked like the covered walkway was the hottest point, and it's functionally impossible to have outdoor sprinklers in climates with freezing temperatures (because they freeze and explode).",t2_6jofy,jce_superbeast,0,1641233826.0,0,t1_hr3olds,hr3olds,False,Grape3645,t3_rulagb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hillsboro/comments/rulagb/update_fire_is_out_extensive_damage/,"UPDATE: Fire is out, extensive damage",/r/hillsboro/comments/rulagb/update_fire_is_out_extensive_damage/hr3olds/,3,r/hillsboro,0,3
