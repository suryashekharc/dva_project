"I have sold a house without a realtor here. It is possible.

First of all, 98% of the industry is lined up with their hand out for a percentage and they make things harder for you. I even found a realtor who wanted several percent just to do the doc stuff. Nope.

* Even if you sell yourself, the other party might have a realtor (a buyer's agent) and THEY will want their 3%
* You can totally skip MLS if you want and do local ads yourself. There's no rule that says you have to be registered.
* If you want MLS there are services that will just list and nothing else.
* In all cases watch out for scammers advertising YOUR house to rent with YOUR pictures in the same place you might be advertising. They try to get dumb people to close the whole transaction remotely. I have a good story for that one.
* Absolutely get a real estate attorney who will do the doc transfers, leg work, haggle with the other party if you want, and watch out for crap, and help wherever. They work by the HOUR instead of the percent. LMK if you need a name. I paid around $1200 in atty time instead of what would have been $8000 to an RE for about the same job.
* You might need to argue with title companies, home insurance providers and inspectors about doing it yourself.

"WEST CHESTER ‚Äî A request from a resident of the West Chester Area School District that it provides her with information about LGBTQ students in its schools has left some parents mystified and upset, as the national debate over gender identity and school-age children appears to have surfaced in Chester County.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust what would be done with that information,‚Äù said one parent about the request, in an interview last week. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anybody‚Äôs business. It is a process that could snowball.‚Äù
During the public comment period at a recent meeting of the West Chester Area School Board, East Bradford resident Jenifer MacFarland spoke about questions she has concerning the appropriateness of the book ‚ÄúGender Queer: A Memoir‚Äù being in district school libraries, and whether or not there is a need for that ‚Äútype of genre‚Äù in the schools.
In order to determine whether or not the award-winning book ‚Äî an illustrated novel of a young person coming to terms with their gender identity that also serves as a guide for those in similar circumstances ‚Äî should continue to be made available in the schools, MacFarland said she needed data on LGBTQ students in the district over a period of years.
‚ÄúI do not think that these data, these numbers, are anything that we should hide,‚Äù MacFarland told school board members as other audience members gasped at her request, made in a formal Right to Know application she delivered to the board. ‚ÄúIn fact, they should inform decisions we make (on) these types of programs we put into place.‚Äù
MacFarland‚Äôs comments were met with applause by some in the audience at Fugett Middle School as they ended.
But it was met by criticism by others, who labeled such requests as intrusive and potentially dangerous for LGBTQ students in West Chester Schools.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs insane,‚Äù said Laura Patarcity, an East Bradford mother of three area high schoolers who attended the Feb. 28 meeting at which McFarland addressed the board. ‚ÄúIt is a violation of the privacy of children, and I question the legality of it. It is not the sort of data that a district can or even should keep.‚Äù
Another parent who attended the meeting and later viewed McFarland‚Äôs comment on a streaming video of the board meeting said the information if provided, could lead to an ‚Äúouting‚Äù of vulnerable young people who have sought to keep their identities private.
‚ÄúI am concerned that it is a reckless disregard for the safety of students,‚Äù said Stephanie Anderson, who lives in West Goshen with her husband and two school-age children. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why she would need those numbers. Some of these kids have not come out to their families, and that information getting out could be dangerous.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of a whole nationwide movement to ban books and limit the voice of the LGBTQ population,‚Äù Anderson said.
Attempts to reach MacFarland by phone last week were unsuccessful. Phone numbers associated with her had been disconnected, and a message left at her business was not immediately returned.
On Friday, a spokeswoman for the West Chester district, Molly Schwemler, said McFarland‚Äôs Right to Know request had been reviewed by the administration, and that it had been granted in part and denied in part.
Her request for a list of the percentage of LGBTQ students in the district was denied, as was her request for the number of referrals of LGBTQ students to guidance counselors over the past 20 years, Schwemler said. ‚ÄúThese records don‚Äôt exist, so we won‚Äôt be forwarding them,‚Äù she said.
She said the district had given MacFarland data on the number of times ‚ÄúGender Queer‚Äù had been checked out of the three high school libraries in the past, but not broken down by grade level. She said the book is not available at the district‚Äôs three middle schools.
The book has undergone a review by the district‚Äôs Book Committee, made up of various stakeholders, and which MacFarland reportedly took part in. Schwemler said the committee would make a recommendation to the board or its Education Committee on whether to keep the book in circulation in the near future.
Schwemler did not provide a copy of MacFarland‚Äôs Right to Know request to the Daily Local News, saying certain information would need to be redacted before doing so. She stressed that the district remains committed to supporting all students no matter what their life circumstances are.
‚ÄúAs in all things, our mission statement guides the WCASD in creating and sustaining a school community that provides the education and support necessary for all of our students to achieve their personal best,‚Äù she said in a statement Friday. ‚ÄúWe take seriously our responsibility to foster welcoming school environments that meet the academic and wellness needs of all of our students, regardless of their experiences, self-expression, or background.‚Äù
‚ÄúGender Queer‚Äù has become a flashpoint for debate over the role schools take in serving LGBTQ students, with conservative voices demanding that it be removed.
Earlier this year, two school districts in northern Virginia banned the book from being carried in its school libraries, after concerns were raised about the graphic novel‚Äôs depictions of sexual contact, masturbation and a sex toy.
The action by those school boards in Fairfax and Loudon counties also comes as gender identity and homosexuality are under attack by Republican politicians in states like Texas and Florida, where the legislature passed a bill last week to forbid instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, rejecting a wave of criticism from Democrats that it marginalizes LGBTQ people.
According to published reports, Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Association Office for Intellectual Freedom, said that challenges against books with LGBTQ- and race-related content have traditionally been ‚Äúconstant,‚Äù this year and that it had seen a ‚Äúchilling‚Äù uptick.
The books that have been challenged in recent months include classics, such as Toni Morrison‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Bluest Eye,‚Äù and modern works, including George M. Johnson‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll Boys Aren‚Äôt Blue,‚Äù a young adult memoir detailing the trials of being a Black queer boy.
But above them all, Kobabe‚Äôs ‚ÄúGender Queer‚Äù has turned into a rallying cry from parents, school officials and lawmakers in at least 11 states ‚Äî from solidly red Texas to reliably blue New Jersey, according to news reports.
MacFarland has had a long career in education. She was a home economics teacher for eight years before becoming a director at the Avon Grove Charter School. She eventually became an educational consultant and is now listed as a co-owner of a local home staging and interior redesign business. In 2015, she ran unsuccessfully for Kennett Square Borough Council as a Republican.
At the board meeting, MacFarland complained that when she asked an administrator for the data on LGBTQ students, she said was necessary to determine whether ‚ÄúGender Queer‚Äù was appropriate for the school libraries she was not immediately given those numbers.
‚ÄúIt poses a question,‚Äù she said in the board video. ‚ÄúIt does not speak well of the West Chester Area School District that it has not responded to requests for data from a taxpayer. It put a question on the willingness to be transparent and forthcoming.
The number of LGBTQ students in the district ‚Äúshould be public information,‚Äù she said.
But both Patarcity and Anderson pushed back at the notion that the public was entitled to learn of LGBTQ student numbers.
‚ÄúIt is dangerous to demand that the school furnish information about anyone‚Äôs children,‚Äù Patarcity said. ‚ÄúWhy do they need that information? I want our schools to be safe and protect them.‚Äù",t2_15c48d,StabbyStabbyFuntimes,0,1647190036.0,0,t1_i0ic25h,i0ic25h,False,ShimmyShimmyYaw,t3_td6yv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/westchesterpa/comments/td6yv4/request_for_information_on_west_chester_lgtbq/,Request for information on West Chester LGTBQ students raises concerns,/r/westchesterpa/comments/td6yv4/request_for_information_on_west_chester_lgtbq/i0ic25h/,18,r/westchesterpa,0,18

"I lived in NYC for 20 years. I visit NYC frequently and love driving in the city. The down side is parking can be pricey and tunnel traffic can be a pain. Here are my thoughts on alternate ways to get there.

Amtrak train from Exton/Paoli: quickest most convenient. Most expensive option. To get the best price buy your tickets early. Prices go up based on availability.

Keystone Train from Exton/Paoli: less expensive than Amtrak takes a bit longer. Catch a train with a dining car, spread out at a table and enjoy a drink/snacks from the bar. Again, book early. This was our option travelling home from NYC when we didn't own a car.

Septa train from Exton/Paoli to Wilmington, transfer to train bound for NYC. Most cost effective local train option, set prices. Longer travel time, I have waited an hour for a connecting train.

Greyhound Bus from Philadelphia: Cheap option, hassle getting to the bus. I've waited in long lines in NYC, get to the terminal early or risk waiting for the bus after the bus you want to get on.

Mega Bus, other bus options: I have no experience, I hear they are cheap.

My go to from West Chester: Drive to Hamilton or Princeton Junction train station. Park in lot, take NJ Transit train to NYC. The drive is easy, mostly highways. I've always felt parking was safe and reasonable. Train fair not bad.

* There are more Amtrak trains from Wilmington to NYC than there are from Exton to NYC, so the scheduling is more flexible.
* Kennett is just a _little_ bit closer to Wilmington than to Exton.

If you don't mind _highway_ driving, other commenters' suggestions to drive to Hamilton NJ or Secaucus Exchange, then take NJT in, are great. I've done it, you skip the driving into and around NYC, and it's less expensive than an Amtrak ticket.

"Its really not a difficult drive and I'd encourage that as it allows the most freedom. Traffic can get hairy getting into the city depending on the time of day but if you're really trying to make a day of it and see a lot of NYC I'd suggest you leave Kennett at like 3:30am and get into the city by 6ish with very little traffic. Park in the cheapest garage that offers day rates you can find and take a taxi/uber somewhere fun for breakfast and then explore the city. Leave after dinner and you should be home by 10:30pm and fall asleep fast after a long fun day.

Or... you can take the train into the city from Media on the R3 or from Downingtown - Exton - or Malvern (parking is free at Exton and Malvern due to construction I think) on the Paoli/Thorndale line. Once at 30th street station in Philadelphia you can either jump on the Acela train direct to Penn Station in NYC (thats gonna be $70-120 though)  OR...  look up ""Chinatown Bus to NYC"" and jump on the bus up to NYC. Its a direct trip. The bus can be stinky and hot and crowded but its also as cheap as $3 and at most like $15.

The train to chinatown bus is an adventure. Its fun if you've never done it. I've done it... so now I drive. I've never taken the Acela but I've heard its the best way to go...but its pricy.

"How does closing it negatively impact businesses that aren't restaurants? I really cannot understand why some people are against this. Closing the street increases foot traffic up and down Gay St, which means more people going into stores and spending money. It gives retailers space to expand outside and offer unique experiences that they might not normally have room for (live music, or expanded displays for example). This past summer Gay St was alive. I live right in the boro, and I did more local shopping than usual because the street was closed. I ate at more restaurants because there was expanded outdoor seating. Give me real reasons why this isn't a fantastic idea. Parking? Shut up, we have garages and you can never find a spot in the summer on Gay St anyway.  Emergencies? Yea, they're working on a better solution, that's easy, but also there are still cross streets and alleys.

"u/nilesecoyote, I agree with your point.

Though originally, Gay Street was a major East-West arterial, it was never actually meant to be a thoroughfare after the Matlack St to Chestnut Street ""viaduct"" was constructed. In the 70s, Gay Street was permanently closed down and was a pedestrian mall, but was reopened just a few years later due to lack of visitors. (I have a old picture of this in a box somewhere. If I find it, I'll scan it and put in a link.)

Today, there is a [sign on the traffic light](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.9617397,-75.6023399,3a,15y,239.17h,101.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9x5LDZVmEl7jLTAlmrXeEQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) at Matlack + Gay that says ""Local Traffic Only,"" and technically the PA-3 designation has ran down Matlack and Chestnut Streets for a while now.

Explain to me the pain points for you personally on closing Gay Street. If you're passing through town, Chestnut Street is parallel and much quicker to drive down. If you want to get somewhere on Gay Street, you need to park in a garage unless you get dropped off. If you do get dropped off, the side streets allow you to be dropped off a half block away from any destination. 

There is an example in these comments on reducing Gay Street to a single lane with some pull offs for delivery trucks. I think that is a terrific idea.

In response to your point about bike lanes, I'd love to see them installed in the borough, but I think they need to be really well planned out beforehand. Right now, East Gay and Market Streets would be horrible places to just install them- there is definitely some more work to be done there.

I know there was a demonstration in 2019 ([Link](https://bicyclecoalition.org/west-chester-creates-a-temporary-protected-bike-lane-help-us-make-it-permanent/)), but there hasn't been much else. It appears that protected bike lanes hinge on the passing of new legislation, HB140, which hasn't seen much action in about a year ([Link](https://trackbill.com/bill/pennsylvania-house-bill-140-an-act-amending-title-75-vehicles-of-the-pennsylvania-consolidated-statutes-in-rules-of-the-road-in-general-further-providing-for-additional-parking-regulations/1978330/)).",t2_39s74rg2,N494f,0,1645305890.0,0,t1_hxmjbqo,hxmjbqo,False,N494f,t3_svmwou,https://www.reddit.com/r/westchesterpa/comments/svmwou/gay_street_news/,Gay Street News!,/r/westchesterpa/comments/svmwou/gay_street_news/hxmjbqo/,2,r/westchesterpa,0,2

"Are you talking about the one in Exton? It was always the slowest option for fast food during my lunch hour when I worked near there around 2015, like comically slow.

One time (just pre-pandemic) I went to get dinner for my family and while I was standing in line, around 7pm, one of the employees went and actually locked the doors so nobody else could come in. There were 5 or 6 customers (including me) in line at the time, and we were all like, WTF? They didn't put out any signs, so naturally, new customers had no idea why we were all in there, getting served, but they were left out in the cold.

It was kind of surreal, kind of scary. People banging on the doors demanding to be let in because the place was clearly open. I finally got my order and an employee had to unlock the door each time to let us all out while simultaneously telling people outside they were closing early. I never found out why, and I never went back.

*Edit: I just remembered there was a Taco Bell / KFC in West Chester. I moved out of WC around 2016, but I remember that the wait staff always gave off a ""I ain't got time for your shit"" type of vibe in both the drive thru and in the restaurant.

"It is 100% your place to complain. 

There is a strong contingent of old people in town that resent the students entirely. Over the years they've passed laws to restrict student housing to certain neighborhoods (think matlack around jake's bar). 

Some people are under the impression that the town has an economic life outside of wcu. They are wrong. this is just an manifestation of that.

Maybe it's just a remnant of wcu being a party school in the 80s, but it seems like people assume having students on their street means loud drunk screaming at night. Not everyone is a sloppy bitch in their 20s.

My old landlord was the second owner of her house that was built in 1912. Her and her husband rented to students for like 50 years and i was the last in a long line. They never had to deal with student housing laws until the 90s or something. At that point it became an under the table affair.

If you rent to the well known slumlords, they tent to have to report their tenants to the local authorities because they have a business license. If you get lucky you might hear about a room for rent in a family's house or guest room. That happens all the time and is the preferred setup.

"Hi I‚Äôm a new WCU transfer too but I‚Äôve been in the area for two years! I live in East Goshen in a 2bd with a roommate (the town of ‚Äúwest chester‚Äù sits on east goshen, west goshen, east Bradford, and west chester boro). The boro (downtown west chester) is the most expensive, east Bradford is mostly giant houses and farmland, so if you can get a car you‚Äôre best off living in a goshen. Anecdotally from my friends‚Äô rents, student housing in the boro is usually about 1200 for a 1bed or studio, 1800 for a 2 bed, and upwards of 3k for a 3/4 bed house depending on proximity to campus‚Ä¶ this is bc west Chester boro has certain areas zoned as student housing, and students are mostly excluded from renting non-student housing. It‚Äôs a racket. In east and West goshen they don‚Äôt have that zoning, you can find a 2bd for around 1400 and the drive is less than 15 minutes, plus a bus goes down west chester pike straight to campus. My bf lived in downingtown and went to school in coastesville. Downingtown is a little nicer than coatesville but they‚Äôre both cheap for a reason, especially the main street areas on Lincoln highway. Coatesville is not especially safe, top tenth percentile crime rate in PA and sadly [the stats speak for themselves](https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/coatesville-chester-pa/crime-safety/). In particular the property crime rate is lower, but it suffers from violent crime (two guys from my bf‚Äôs graduating class have been killed in separate shootings in the past two years). If living alone is important to you, you could feasibly live very cheaply there, but the peace of mind from living closer to west chester might be worth the hassle of a roommate and a little more rent. If you are into the party/Greek/bar scene you might want to live in the boro for better party opportunities and an easier walk home when you‚Äôre trashed. I‚Äôve found the boro to be pretty safe and I‚Äôve always felt fine walking by myself at night, none of my friends in the boro have experienced any property crime. West Chester police are also very present in the boro. However I chose my place in east goshen because it came down to price, it‚Äôs easily commutable, and I like having some distance from campus when it‚Äôs especially busy on the weekends (plus I get a free guaranteed parking spot at my place, can‚Äôt say that about many places the boro)! Some places worth checking out around west chester are rose hill apartments, heather glen, goshen manor, Cambridge hall, golf club, and goshen valley condos (also Bradford hall in the boro but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre student zoned).

"**[Red flag law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_law)** 
 
 >In the United States, a red flag law is a gun control law that permits police or family members to petition a state court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. A judge makes the determination to issue the order based on statements and actions made by the gun owner in question. Refusal to comply with the order is punishable as a criminal offense. After a set time, the guns are returned to the person from whom they were seized unless another court hearing extends the period of confiscation.

"Well, I believe you still need the appraisal so the bank can provide the mortgage. They won‚Äôt lend to you without knowing what the house is worth. 

For example, if I wanted to make a cash offer on a home for 450k and I‚Äôm asking for a mortgage of 400k of that, the bank needs to appraise the house to see if it‚Äôs worth the investment it‚Äôs giving me money for. Especially now when the market is so hot, it‚Äôs easy for bidding wars to drive up prices on homes beyond their appraised value. If the house appraised for less than the 450k I‚Äôm offering, depending on the difference, my mortgage insurance might go up because the bank is taking a riskier investment by lending me that money, OR I could pay the difference out of pocket and continue with the loan for 400k, if I had the money for that. 

Waiving the contingency just means that if the seller accepts my offer of 450k and then I find out the bank won‚Äôt give me a mortgage for the house (because it didn‚Äôt appraise for that value) I wouldn‚Äôt be able to back out of the contract without losing my deposit. Depending on your offer that could be anywhere from 10-20k so it can be risky.

I take my asshole dog to dr bergman in plymouth meeting.

she's expensive, but she's really a specialist for this type of stuff. 

behavioral issues are handled by trainers most of the time. If it gets to a certain level then a specialist is required, but this is usually for dogs that are in danger of being put down (for biting/hurting someone).

That being said, my dog has really turned around and is probably still alive because of her help (and my hard work).

"You can try Drain-o but it is a temporary fix. Might be worth a shot though. Someone mentioned snaking it and they‚Äôre right. You need to break up and remove whatever is in there. Sometimes it‚Äôs just food etc in the trap under the sink. You‚Äôll see the piping from the sink basin to the wall is made up of multiple segments held together with large nuts, with a rubber or plastic seal inside each. They can be removed easily with a pair of channel lock pliers. Directly below the drain of the sink is the trap, its a J shaped segment. It‚Äôs easy to disassemble however I find 9 times out of 10 times I need to replace a seal or two and sometimes the segments are in bad shape so I replace those too. All of the parts can be bought at Home Depot really cheap  but you should take the old ones with you to be sure you get the proper replacements. The people at the Fraser branch are very helpful so I‚Äôd consider going there. 
If the trap isn‚Äôt the problem, then the clog is further down the line. In that case you‚Äôll need a drain snake. They come in different sizes including a small homeowner type. You would still have to remove the trap, and enter the drain at the wall. Look for videos of that too. 
There are plenty of videos of this repair on YouTube and lots of other websites. But honestly, it‚Äôs very easy but it takes a few times before you‚Äôll be truly comfortable and proficient at it.  
Also:
Keep a bucket handy if you disassemble the trap as it will have a bit of water in it. 
Take some photos before you disassemble so you can put it back together the way it originally was
Make sure none of the seals are leaking after reassembly. They like to do that.

"Couple options and depends on where you live. Most areas except the center of town either have free parking or parking permits. You can can find all the info you need, including the application for the permit [at the west Chester boro website](https://www.west-chester.com/173/Residential-Permit-Parking-Program). 

Other than that there are monthly permits through the parking garages that are all around.  Never done that though (it's pretty damn expensive) so can't be too much help there. 

Note you can only get the permit for your residence's zone and then you can park anywhere in that zone. 

A couple of call-outs. Watch out for street cleaning. It's once a week, each side is a separate day at a specific time (usually a 3 hours window), again dependant on where you live (look for signs). Parking authority will ticket you for parking too close to stop signs. Also just be aware of any snow emergency routes. It can either be the whole street or one side of it. If a snow emergency is declare all parking garages are free of cost so you can relocate your car there. If there is a snow emergency street cleaning is cancelled, but even if they revoke the snow emergency the night before street cleaning the parking authority will get you for it. Oh also street cleaning isn't on holidays. 

To be honest, the parking situation here is shit. As a result people are up tight about it. Private lots that says they'll tow you will, with only a couple exceptions.",t2_43kzwfv,7itemsorFEWER,0,1642473553.0,0,t1_ht4icwp,ht4icwp,True,Complete_Tip_2338,t3_s6i991,https://www.reddit.com/r/westchesterpa/comments/s6i991/parking_downtown/,Parking downtown,/r/westchesterpa/comments/s6i991/parking_downtown/ht4icwp/,6,r/westchesterpa,0,6

"It‚Äôs a combination of lack of decent pay and quality of life. (I taught or subbed in various capacities at the CCIU, DCIU, UCFASD, DASD, OXASD, and CASD for about 10 years). 

-The pay is low and poorly distributed: The contracts are ridiculous. It can take about 20 years to reach the top rate and is tied to your additional education. So for instance someone with a masters or doctorate magically makes more money than you even if you‚Äôre doing the same job. Why come back to teaching if you have to start near the bottom again? 

-The quality of life is bad and getting worse: Every teacher that I‚Äôve kept in touch with has quit or is counting down the days to retirement. Managing student behaviors has become more of a problem. The amount of SDIs that teachers are expected to be familiar with and make adaptions for has increased. Virtual learning is challenging when many kids don‚Äôt have any support at home (or repercussions for not doing their work). I literally had ice on the inside of my classroom window my last year of teaching for several weeks. Good luck teaching kids that are freezing (and no they wouldn‚Äôt let us bring in space heaters). 

They have to incentivize people to actually want to get into the profession and stay there.

"DONT rent from Audubon Manor! The apartments are infested with cockroaches, and the management company is not professional. They will raise your rent every year. You have to pay a monthly ""admin"" fee, a $20 trash fee, and they didn't turn on the heat for your apartment until the temperature dropped below 50 degrees. I learned the hard way and suffered for a year living there. I fought cockroaches even after they treated the building (sometimes twice a month) all year long. Every time they treated I was ""forced"" to remove EVERYTHING from all the cabinets in the apartment and if I didn't, they would charge me for the service and they would give me 48-hour notice to do it.

"I'd recommend Corner Park Apartments. It's kind of like a satellite complex to New Kent Apartments, both are on Boot Rd. You can use the gym and pool at New Kent and the apartments are nice, clean, plus the maintenance guy lives in the complex (which is only 3 buildings). Plus it's right next door to a good pizza place (Sabatino's) and a good Chinese food place (Hong Kong). The only reason my wife and I left was because there are no units with hardwood flooring. 

&#x200B;

I'd also like to recommend avoiding Waterview apartments. They are comparatively pretty cheap, but the management was terrible for us during our year there. Felt kinda deceived by the leasing agent, they had terrible timelines for maintenance, the unit was pretty dirty and needed a good bit of work before we could move in, there were bugs painted over, gum on top of one of the door frames, etc. Plus, there's only 2 maintenance workers for the entirety of the complex, which is easily over 200 apartments (\~11 per building, Buildings A-T).

"**[Oaklands Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaklands_Cemetery)** 
 
 >Oaklands Cemetery is a rural cemetery founded in 1854 in West Chester, Pennsylvania. It is located at 1042 Pottstown Pike and occupies roughly 26 acres (0. 11 km2). Oaklands Cemetery was founded as a response to the closure of graveyards within the borough of West Chester and the stoppage of future burials allowed within it.
 
**[Samuel Barber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Barber)** 
 
 >Samuel Osmond Barber II (March 9, 1910 ‚Äì January 23, 1981) was an American composer, pianist, conductor, baritone, and music educator, and one of the most celebrated composers of the 20th century. The music critic Donal Henahan stated, ""Probably no other American composer has ever enjoyed such early, such persistent and such long-lasting acclaim"".

I guess this does create a mathematical limit on the number of student rentals, but the ordinances really were to address the *density* of student rentals which historically caused problems in parts of town. 

I don't feel too bad for property owners in town - demand is sky high right now and I can't imagine why you'd rent to students unless you were trying to hold onto a permit.

"> What would prevent you from just renting to students and just never declaring anything? 

The boro requires you to provide the name of your tenants and (annually) register and inspect your property with the boro in order to (legally) rent it out. The form makes you note if any tenants are students and has an ominous threat about making an ""Unsworn Falsification to Authorities"", but I think realistically they'd just revoke your rental permit when they find out. Being a student isn't a protected class, so there's no restrictions on a landlord asking applicants about it.

"There are *some* areas of the boro where a new student rental is a permitted use, [but most of town would require a special exception](https://west-chester.com/DocumentCenter/View/17337/Zoning-Update-Final) and require meeting the following conditions (most will fail item C). 

Edit: Given the demand in WC, I'm not sure why you'd want to rent to students. They tend to be problem tenants for landlords and you're usually looking are more frequent turnover. Also, renting to students (legally or not) may not thrill your non-student neighbors and they may go out of their way to make your life difficult with the boro (and possibly your renter's life with the police).

> ¬ß 112-906 Standards for granting a special exception for a student home.
The following criteria must be met before the Zoning Hearing Board may authorize a special exception for a
student home in the NC-1 or NC-2 Zoning District or in a dwelling unit which is not a multifamily dwelling
unit in the NC-3 Zoning District:

>A. The single-family dwelling has a floor area of at least 1,000 square feet exclusive of basements, garages and accessory buildings.

>B. A student home shall not be located within 500 feet of a group home, group quarters institution, church, educational use, housing for older persons or home for handicapped individuals. The distance between the two uses shall be measured by the shortest distance between the lot on which the proposed student home will be located and the lot or lots which contain the existing uses.

>C. A student home shall not be located closer than the distance equal to 20 times the required street frontage for the Neighborhood Conservation District Block Class where the student home is proposed to be located from another student home. The distance between the two student homes shall be measured by the shortest distance between the two lots where the student homes are located.

>D. A student home shall meet the area and bulk requirements for a single-family dwelling in the applicable zoning district where such use is proposed.

>E. The owner of the student home, or the agent or manager of the student home, shall annually register the student home with the Borough Department of Building and Housing on a form provided by the Borough. If the owner of the student home fails to maintain a current registration of his or her student home, the Zoning Officer shall enforce such condition.

>F. If the single-family dwelling where the student home is proposed cannot meet the parking requirements set forth in Article VI, the Zoning Hearing Board may still authorize the special exception with the condition that the number of occupants which may reside at the student home shall be limited to the number of off-street parking spaces provided at the single-family dwelling.",t2_9v869,exotube,0,1641236025.0,0,t1_hr3umk3,hr3umk3,True,milquetoast_wizard,t3_rv3qie,https://www.reddit.com/r/westchesterpa/comments/rv3qie/i_own_a_home_in_the_borough_am_i_able_to_rent_to/,"I own a home in the borough, am I able to rent to students?

"Feels like one of those trendy ‚Äúlets follow the big cities‚Äù pushes. Yeah it‚Äôs marginally more eco-friendly, but it‚Äôs kind of a moot point when it‚Äôs such a small area that people just go to a Giant or Acme or Wawa half a mile outside the borough and get normal plastic bags. Plus, charging for *paper* isn‚Äôt really a great alternative. Fun fact: One tree produces 700 paper bags, and reportedly 4x as much energy and water are used to create paper bags than plastic bags. Paper weighs more and takes up more space per bag, leading to a higher carbon footprint, and are also less durable to survive multiple reuses. However, 67% of trees cut down in sustainable forests for paper milling are re-planted for later use. So like everything else in the world, there‚Äôs arguments for both sides depending on how you want to spin it.

"It‚Äôs not an easy answer but not for the reasons politicians would espouse. It‚Äôs difficult because of inertia. People don‚Äôt like change, especially sudden change. We got to this point through nearly 70 years of decisions made slowly and gradually so what I‚Äôm going to propose will seem scary to most people.

Put the ball back in the payer‚Äôs court.  The people with the most at stake aren‚Äôt paying right now.

1. Require all medical service providers and facilities to publish a ‚Äúblue book‚Äù of prices for every medical code, service‚Äîboth ‚Äúlabor and materials.‚Äù The prices can be changed as often as needed but changes need to be publicly published at least 180 days in advance of the price change.

2. Incentivize insurance companies to get 100% of the population covered by providing tax breaks to reduce their federal (and hopefully state will follow suit eventually) tax liability towards 0% as they approach the 100% enrollment in a given state. Insurance companies will find a way to offer affordable plans with so much cash savings on the line. This will also naturally spur them to compete with each other to prevent any ‚Äúgaps‚Äù from forming in coverage within the population.

Further, the amount of overhead in administrative and general operating costs imposed by such a government system is as much as 40% of a hospitals entire operating budget.

"Sorry, but my attitude about the east coast generally is that it's ""spent"" as far as space goes.

I grew up in media and there have been massive awful mcmansions going up in what little space there was for at least 20 years. the result is that the endless trees you'd see driving around are replaced by signs for whatever terribly built hillside condos went up this year.

Contrast that to places in the country that actually have space ie the mountain west/very northern california (and generally the pacific north west). It just feels like scrapping about little tracks in PA on what used to be farmland anyway doesn't matter all that much.

other metro areas have a lighter rail system that serves the suburbs. When i lived in the bay area there was caltrain and then the other one that served the south bay to san jose.

but, land for rail is expensive and the trains we have available here are very slow. This will also ruin property values along the route at a time when land/housing is at a premium.

"I work downtown and very rarely take 76 in but it is the most direct route if you're catching it at the right time of day (assuming you're heading to center city). Typically the easiest way is to do 322/352/providence road to 95/1/476. If you need to get to center city west hop off 95 at the Platt Bridge and turn on 26th street to link up with 76 west. If you need to go to Old City/NE just keep going on 95 all the way around. You can also get off Platt Bridge exit for sports complex too if Girard Point Bridge is a mess.

Also, if you have AJB, you can mail it I know some of my neighbors just do that. See below via Westtown Township's website: https://www.westtownpa.org/trash-recycling/

Tipping Your Trash Hauler:  
  
Trash collection is a strenuous and often thankless job, performed in the sweltering summer, pouring rain, freezing winter, and all weather conditions in between.  This holiday season, if you are inclined to show your appreciation for this hard work by tipping the haulers who remove your trash & recycling, please be cautious.  Sadly, there have been incidents of people stealing tips taped to trash receptacles.  Instead, the Township‚Äôs hauler recommends mailing your tip to:  
  
A.J. Blosenski, Inc.  
Attn: Chelsea  
P.O. 392  
Elverson, PA 19520
