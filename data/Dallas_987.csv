"I'm gonna push back on that and say there are more loud people loudly spouting hate in Christ's name than there are spouting love, because those who are loving and living a clearly Biblical life are not ones to start drama and make the public stage about them and their political crusades. No group is a monolith and the most vocal and visible elements tend to be, or include, the worst actors, because toxicity is profitable and attention grabbing. It isn't a systemic issue within Christianity, it's far more to do with the decadent, individualistic, neoliberal west and our privatized speech platforms that incentivize this kind of behavior among all groups because it's profitable for the corporations which own these outlets and platforms. This is what causes the majority of our contemporary feedback loops of insane politicians leading their constituents to the drumbeat of war, fascism, anti-intellectualism, white supremacy, and myopic imperialist attitudes. Biblical Christianity is opposed in principle to these things, and indeed it can be seen extensively outside the imperial core. It is not unique to Christianity, but America does have a unique relationship between the forces of capital and religion as a syncretic civic-religiosity baked into its foundations (such as many of the founders stating the nation was designed to only function with a ""religious"" populace, though most of these weren't even Christians but Deists)... and I say this as a theologically conservative reformed Christian who's politically a Bernie-isn't-left-enough Marxist.",t2_zdq0j,jershdotrar,0,1648273024.0,0,t1_i25ud7u,i25ud7u,False,aggie1391,t3_tnxgw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/tnxgw8/in_a_suburban_fort_worth_house_runoff_republicans/,"In a suburban Fort Worth House runoff, Republicans debate killing women over abortion",/r/Dallas/comments/tnxgw8/in_a_suburban_fort_worth_house_runoff_republicans/i25ud7u/,2,r/Dallas,0,2

"Could you explain CRT? I am being serious.

There seems to be two different terms for CRT, somewhat like BLM or other terms. I'll use BLM as an example....There was an organization BLM which people eventually started to dissociate with BLM 'the movement,' essentially creating two different meanings of BLM. When criticisms of the organization came up, the average person with no real idea what was going on really supported the 'movement' which is not really what BLM was at it's core to begin with. It ends up being something that nobody even knows what exactly it is in the end. Is BLM a marxist org specifically word for word looking to essentially radically tear down the walls of modern society in a world the white man had built and restart from scratch, or is it a movement trying to highlight the inequity some people have to deal with and making lives better for all? I think even large outspoken supporters of BLM still to this day don't truly know what BLM started as.

I think essentially the exact same thing has happened with CRT and nobody really knows what the target is at this point. We need real definitions for these things but we seem to not be able to actually choose. I mean, the simple word Racism seems to have a revolving meaning as well, with people like Ta Nehisi Coates using a very different definition than people like Robin Diangelo, who, I am not kidding, contradicts herself multiple times in her own books about what the definition of racism is. I respect Coates on a whole other level above Diangelo, but Diangelo is really the one most people have heard snippets on and she is a complete mess in epic proportion.

I don't blame people for not knowing what CRT actually is.",t2_wr175vb,xAimForTheBushes,0,1648260625.0,0,t1_i2596hr,i2596hr,False,yosemitebison,t3_tnmu4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/tnmu4z/north_texas_superintendents_say_uproar_over/,North Texas superintendents say uproar over critical race theory in schools is a Republican ‚Äúmanufactured crisis‚Äù,/r/Dallas/comments/tnmu4z/north_texas_superintendents_say_uproar_over/i2596hr/,1,r/Dallas,0,1

"You must know this is down to a failure of both teachers as well as a lack of emphasis and importance on schooling by both the kids and the parents.

I know for 100% sure that the US civil war is specifically taught in public elementary through high school across the nation.

We're simply as a whole a bunch of idiots and on top of that we don't place much value on it anymore as a country for whatever reason. We also put basically zero accountability on teachers. It is a two way street as well...we have a large percentage of truly horrific teachers but we don't have enough qualified people to even fill those jobs to begin with. We're hopeless unless we invest far more into education from the ground up and create higher standards for teachers with better pay to go with it.

"Lmao.

I lived in a 1920s house for a rather long time.

Upon moving in, it needed the foundation leveled.  Unlike the newer houses, it was pier-and-beam.  So, the ""foundation work"" was just getting the corners of the house jacked up and shims added until the floor was level.

The only other major maintenance/repairs it needed was having a beam in the attic replaced due to the previous owners having cut it to install a water heater.  Other than that, it was an uneventful 8 years.  Solid oak frame, limestone walls.  Needed mortar touch-ups every year or so, but that took maybe two hours total.  

With my current house, it's *always* something that needs work every year.  Some siding needs replacing.  Some bullshit with the roof after every damn hail storm.  Foundation slab is cracking and all I can do is water it to slow it down.  Random plumbing issues.  Shitty laminate floors that wear through and get crunchy edges.

"Critical race theory is a sociological theory which examines and challenges the structure of our society through the lens of race. Having been based off of critical theory, and often is associated with Marxist ideology, critical race theory shines a focus between levels of societal privilege and ~~racism~~ racial appearance, treating privilege as a ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù or tangible asset of sorts, despite being mainly out of an individuals control. This is partly why the concept of systemic racism is of a larger focus in CRT. 

When people refer to crt in schools, they‚Äôre n not talking about the theory itself but the praxis, or real world application, being used on their children. An example being segregating students of a particular racial ethnicity in order to showcase a particular lesson on slavery (this is a general e example, not trying to be specific). 

Now, I‚Äôll gladly wait to be torn apart by people telling me how incorrect, ignorant, stupid, or bigoted I am for saying what I‚Äôve been led to believe CRT is through the sources Wikipedia provided me, my work within education, and the college course i had to take years ago that utilized CRT concepts.

"""It amazes me how little people read.""  ""Or that it's not taught in your kids schools."" 

Here's some irony.  Alleging people's ignorance while displaying your own. 

 If you're convinced CRT curriculums do not exist in K - 12 schools then your relying on one-sided stories via the mainstream media.  Because there are piles of videos showing parents testifying with irrefutable evidence of blatant CRT ideologies being taught in every single tier of K - 12 schools in many counties across the nation. I've been seeing them for the last 18 months.  Including examples of classroom activities where white children are getting separated from and accused by minority children and made to apologize and act subservient, all under the supervision of the teacher.  This is happening right now in classrooms in America.  In Elementary Schools and High Schools. 

News Censorship manipulates the ideology and knowledge of the people by filtering large portions of events from their platform and telling their readers/viewers that none of it exists and accusing those saying it does of being conspiracy zealots.  All while they suppress the evidence to the contrary.

Broaden your horizons by looking for news commentary outside of the mainstream.  And FYI mainstream includes Fox News, I'm including them.  All of mainstream news is owned by 15 Billionaires/Billionaire Families.  They discovered they could enrich their investments by manipulating the content of the news.  Their succeeding.

">That's exactly why religion isn't taught in schools because that's a social issue, even though it's absolutely the world we live in. Belief systems are not for education, math/reading/wring/language/science/history is.  
  
The fact that religion isn't taught as fact in schools has nothing to do with being a social issue. It's a constitutional one. As you should be aware, religion is specifically called out in the Bill of Rights in such a way as to prevent the government from showing preference of one over others. This is not true of any other social issues.

Supply chain issues increasing replacement part costs
Chip shortage driving the cost of cars up, resulting in the value of existing vehicles to increase

Traffic levels and crashes are returning to pre-COVID levels, and crashes increase accordingly.

Inflation generally, with employees demanding higher wages and many business related costs increasing accordingly

"I own a small, 100-year-old home just a few blocks from this.

Just a couple of thoughts without committing to some of the hornet nests:

* The idea that older houses are somehow expired/not worth the upkeep seems to be regional. I hear it around DFW all the time, but I spent most of my adult life in Chicago, where an overwhelming majority of the housing stock is 75-125 years old and nobody really ever really mentions it. It‚Äôs just the way things are. I‚Äôve heard in Japan, on the other hand, housing stock depreciates over time and old used houses are held in the same/less esteem as worn out used cars. People like to knock down and rebuild. It‚Äôs just curious, that‚Äôs all. Dallas seems more Japan-y, less Chicago-y.

* I love the NIMBY/YIMBY arguments, both sides make valid points at times, however: Please don‚Äôt mention San Francisco/the Bay Area at every turn.

"You make Fair points. But property values have gone up substantially as well as rent prices. This is incentivizing developers such as this one to build right now. Just Google building permits numbers in Dallas. Eventually if they run out of good opportunities they will stop building, as you say. So your promise suggests that nothing gets built if it doesn't command high prices. But if we need more housing by that logic we need higher prices. Alternatively, the government Can build affordable housing projects. Other than that, I don't really see a good solution. Again, we need more housing but under your promise to get those developers to build we need higher prices. If rent controls were put in place wouldn't that hinder the incentives for builders? And thus we have the same problem. You make good points and this is a complex problem but all I know is that rent control programs have been a disaster in other states and is leading loads of people to move to states like Texas and Florida. Furthermore, lower class wages have risen sharply over the past few years even more so than high earners on a percentage basis. With government stimulus folks should be able to afford better and more expensive apartments. Another reason I'm in favor of these developments is that they stimulate the economy. Developers want to build new restaurants, event venues, parks, Etc. This drives job creation and ads New and interesting things to do in the city. I'm all in favor of making Dallas a more walkable City with more things to do. I've always felt that Dallas is missing some of those characteristics that make other cities more fun and attractive to visitors. Homeowners in these areas become more wealthy as their property values increase. They can cash out if they want and sell, or they can stay put and continue becoming more wealthy by holding equity in their home long-term.",t2_aeiyeq2,autr3go,0,1648233911.0,0,t1_i23kv71,i23kv71,False,SerkTheJerk,t3_tn7nwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/tn7nwt/why_an_entire_block_of_cool_old_and_affordable/,"Why an entire block of cool, old and affordable Bishop Arts housing is about to be bulldozed",/r/Dallas/comments/tn7nwt/why_an_entire_block_of_cool_old_and_affordable/i23kv71/,1,r/Dallas,0,1

"Yeah, if any of the D&I teaching incorporates any hint of ""systemic racism"", it's labeled as CRT without any nuance. It's a blind hammer for sure. To be fair the narrative that CRT is exclusively a graduate level studies is intellectually dishonest, and if we're going to prevail with D&E&I we have to be honest with ourselves, and with our messages.

We certainly don't want children to feel shame for any reason, including their religion (or lack of), sexuality, gender identity, or their skin color. So it follows we wouldn't want something like ""CRT"" to foster a toxic environment. At the same time, history has to be taught, and social economics has to be taught, and the existence of bias & prejudice has to be taught. We cannot white wash history, or ignore actual reality, but at the same time we cannot create the toxic environment we simultaneously want to avoid.

So I totally understand, but at the same time I'd love to see a coherent credible allegation of this systemic racism narrative being taught in public schools, or even reasonably implied, or entailed....

"My kid goes to private school. No we are not rich, but I don't have a new truck because the truck payment is her tuition. Things like sex and CRT are just not even on the radar at her school. Why? Because those are SOCIAL issues, not education issues. My daughter is educated, not indoctrinated. We, the parent, teach her about sex, differences in cultures and race, and so forth. This isn't even a democrat versus republican thing, it's a healthy approach to humanity thing. Kids need to be kids and they need to focus on developing the brain for basic, standard things like reading, writing, math and basics of history (dates, events, etc). Why we are trying to force 7 or even 17 year olds to make decisions on very intense and complicated social issues is absolutely baffling.

"Not in today's real estate climate. Developers aren't interested in building low-end apartments because there's no money in it. Revenue per unit is the driving metric, so why build some cheap apartment that only gets $1,000/month when you can build an upscale unit that gets $2,000+? Building for lower rent is literally leaving money on the table, and developers that leave money on the table don't stay in business long.

The only way to build affordable apartments is through rent control, and that's not going to happen in the current Texas political climate.

""In 1850 Captain John Sutter laid out the City of Sacramento. He could not have been auto-oriented. He was horse- and pedestrian-oriented. He set aside not 1.6 percent, not 15 percent, not 22 percent, but *38 percent* of the area for streets and sidewalks.  
The parts of Sacramento that were laid out in the 1900-1930 era have about 21 percent of the area in streets, and the parts that have been laid out since World War II have about 15 percent. The overall average in the city is 22 percent.

"There was ice and snow mixed into a solid week of below-freezing temps. This part of the country doesn't get that kind of weather very often, so we just don't have the infrastructure for it. 

Because the temps stayed so low, relentlessly, nothing melted. If you were snowbound you were staying snowbound. Temps this low for a sustained period of time creates frozen pipes, even in homes that kept electricity. When pipes freeze, they can burst. Burst pipes gush freezing cold water and can ruin furniture, floors, walls, etc.

The power grid couldn't keep up with demand. It was completely inconsistent. Some never lost power. Some people, like me, lost power for 3, 4, 5 hours a few times. Some people had no power for a week. People sat at home in the dark, without heat, unable to make warm food or have a warm beverage. In my house, with the power out for 3 or 4 hours, the inside temperature dropped into the 50s. I'm sure it went lower for those who had no relief. Some of these people also had no water, which also meant they couldn't flush the toilet.

My daughter was one of these people. She was trapped in an apartment complex for a week without electricity. The water had been turned off to the buildings to prevent frozen pipes. The parking lot was 2-3' deep in snow, and there were no plows. The apartment complex was not within walking distance of ANYTHING useful, but even if there was anything useful nearby, they also had no power. She would go to her car to get warm and charge her phone. Outside of that, she sat at home alone and froze. Watching her suffer through that while being hours away and completely incapable of helping was a kind of torture. Uber was not operating, no one was delivering food, the roads were hazardous, hotels were either at capacity or without power. And so on. 

Those of us with electricity got to bear witness to everyone's misery and the tragedy of it all on TV. I remember one story of a little boy who, earlier that day, played outside in his first ever snowfall, and he was dead soon after, I don't know if it was because he froze to death in his little house or if it was carbon monoxide. People died both ways. Desperation led many people to doing unsafe things to try to get warm, like burning a charcoal grill in their house, and people died this was. People also died because they couldn't get to medical care, or they ran out of oxygen, or they had equipment that required electricity to work. The news was a parade of tragedy, watching people die and watching nothing much happen to stop it. It was horrific.",t2_d5jvl,throwitawaydaybyday,0,1648184427.0,0,t1_i212fbf,i212fbf,True,Tiar-A,t3_tna6jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/tna6jc/need_help_with_researching_2021_winter_storm/,Need help with researching 2021 winter storm,/r/Dallas/comments/tna6jc/need_help_with_researching_2021_winter_storm/i212fbf/,10,r/Dallas,0,10

"In the United States, redlining is a discriminatory practice in which services (financial and otherwise) are withheld from potential customers who reside in neighborhoods classified as 'hazardous' to investment; these neighborhoods have significant numbers of racial and ethnic minorities, and low-income residents.[2] While the most well-known examples involve denial of credit and insurance, denial of healthcare and the development of food deserts in minority neighborhoods have also been attributed to redlining in many instances.[3][4] In the case of retail businesses like supermarkets, the purposeful construction of stores impractically far away from targeted residents results in a redlining effect.[4]

Affordable is relative.  The houses that were torn down weren't affordable anymore either for a first time home buyer.

"We own a 80 year old home in North Oak Cliff that we love, we plan on living here until we retire, one of the reasons we love it so much is the ""charm"", we have restored/kept as much as reasonably possible and what we have replaced was at least in the aesthetic spirit of the original design. And I mean it, down to a rotary phone in the phone nook that actually works, you can literally pick it up and dial a number.

But let me tell you something, when people talk about charm and how older house are perfectly fine, they are actually incredibly expensive to upgrade to modern standards, repair and maintain. It cost us over $5,000 just to install a dishwasher, around 4k to repair and restore the original hardwood floors in less than half of house, that also required vacating the house for a week, $3k to replace the rotten manually operated garage door with an automatic one.

New windows, insulation, new roof, new HVAC, termite remediation, new electrical, we are probably going to have to replace our refrigerator in the next couple of years, it's going to cost at least $2k to do the cabinet work alone to fit a modern refrigerator in. And our three bedroom, 1,400 sqft house has one small bathroom.

Now keep in mind, the owners of these houses often can't afford that, the prices have exploded in North Oak Cliff, especially near Bishop Arts, that means decades of deferred maintenance. It kills me but at least two beautiful houses on my street that are currently occupied are probably completely unsalvageable at this point, one has already been torn down, we will be lucky if they keep the beautiful facade on the other two like they did the first.

"Excerpt


‚ÄúThis soon-to-be-extinct collection of homes, with their welcoming porches and nice-sized yards, is the latest victim of gentrification‚Äôs density and displacement realities.

It‚Äôs also the reason why residents everywhere in Dallas ‚Äî most especially in West Oak Cliff where its own area plan is in the works ‚Äî need to get involved and make sure proposed blueprints match what they want for their neighborhood.

The future of the 2.67-acre block of West Eighth ‚Äî and a lot of others like it ‚Äî was sealed in 2010 by the Bishop/Davis Land Use Study, led by neighborhood stakeholders and approved by a City Council that included then-North Oak Cliff representatives Delia Jasso and Dave Neumann.

That effort, Planned Development District No. 830, was intended to guide development while maintaining the area‚Äôs character. What‚Äôs happened in the years since is a dizzying mashup of extravagantly priced homes and huge no-soul apartment buildings.

Take your pick ‚Äî ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Uptown My Oak Cliff‚Äù or ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Highland Park My Oak Cliff.‚Äù Both cries are accurate.

PD 830 put in place aggressive zoning designed for density: Tall buildings without setback requirements and no tools for preservation or reuse of existing structures that could compete against the market forces that made demolition overwhelmingly attractive.

Nor were restrictions put in place on the size of lots and buildings that would have prevented boring behemoth apartment buildings from overshadowing the district‚Äôs wonderfully repurposed commercial spots and original housing.

The greater injustice is how PD 830 has allowed density to encroach on existing neighborhoods and undercut what little affordable housing is left in North Oak Cliff. While the West Eighth block between Llewellyn and Adams is almost adjacent to Bishop Arts main corridors, it is also the northeast piece of a cohesive neighborhood of modest and well-tended homes.‚Äù",t2_iahw2alu,SerkTheJerk,0,1648161937.0,0,t1_i1zr0z1,i1zr0z1,True,SerkTheJerk,t3_tn7nwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/tn7nwt/why_an_entire_block_of_cool_old_and_affordable/,"Why an entire block of cool, old and affordable Bishop Arts housing is about to be bulldozed",/r/Dallas/comments/tn7nwt/why_an_entire_block_of_cool_old_and_affordable/i1zr0z1/,6,r/Dallas,0,6

"1. Trans children/teens/adults/elderly/any other sub-category of age are not messing up this country. Politicians making decisions on things they are not fully educated on, don't understand on any level(see technology related laws), perhaps do understand but intentionally influence the public, media, and constituents one way or another is far more prevalent and impacting issue affecting and ""messing up"" this country.
2. Have you ever looked for actual instances where parent(s) have brainwashed a child, forced them into a different gender identity than they themselves personally feel? I poked through some search results and outside of VERY recent allegations from a parent that teachers ""brainwashed"" a kid...this seems like Facebook News.
3. Any parent who has any idea of what a person will have to go through to be the gender they feel they truly are, mostly from other humans like yourself who think you are superior and have it all figured out...do you really think a parent would force that on them? To deal with the likes of YOU?

You should be ashamed of how small minded and ignorant you come off.
