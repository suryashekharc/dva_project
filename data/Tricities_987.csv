"Top in Cuisine Type

1) Burger Ranch in Kennewick, Vineyard Drive. Fat burgers, fat portion of fries. So many options to choose from as well and the beef actually tastes delicious!
2) Sawadee Thai for their orange chicken. Skip Panda and try them out next time! Sushi award goes to Sushi Nori and their Godzilla Roll. Tokyo Sushi & Teriyaki and Red Bento deserve their honorable mentions. Different restaurants for Asian cuisine is important, not all of them are equal!
3) Mexico Lindo y Que Rico for big plates. If you want tacos, Tacos Colima in Kennewick are epic. For Pasco, Tacos El Jefe is new and surprisingly very good although a bit pricey. For Richland, the Wild Taco. My friend's dad owns it and I never had it before she gave me food.
4) For all American, Texas Roadhouse blows em all out of the water. Want ribs? Their BBQ Ribs will tear apart from their bone and taste so good you will want another set. Ribeye? You better get ready to pay up but it's absolutely worth it. Chicken fried steak? It's my favorite! Their prices aren't horrible either unless you decide to buy steaks for everyone which is not cheap. Their wings are amazing as well. Rattlesnake Bites and loaded potato wedges. And did I almost forget the addictive rolls with cinnamon butter. üòõ
5) Last but not least, my addiction. The holy grail of my belly. I won't eat all day just waiting to chomp this monstrosity down. Brother's Cheesesteaks. Savory ribeye steak, scrumptious caramelized onions, soft mushrooms, exquisite bell peppers, topped with cheese whiz, provolone and their signature sauce. I present to you, the Steak Melt. Locally owned as well, I personally know the owner. I'm the guy with the white shirt and red tie on one of his videos. I got my tie dirty.

"The biggest adjustment has been finding new things to do. Every place has its ups and downs, and you have to seek out the unique opportunities the area has available.

The biggest positive surprise is how much I actually love the weather. Spring is absolutely amazing. And the intense summer heat is perfect for playing on the water. If you have access to a pool, a boat, or frequent the river beaches then a 95-degree day is just about right.

The biggest negative surprise is the freaking wind. You will want to consider that when looking for a neighborhood. For example, there are lots of nice homes being built up on Badger Mountain but you won't be able to have patio furniture or leave anything outside without it blowing away. It's also going to be brutal in the big new neighborhood being built on the south side of Badger Mountain.

A side note about the outdoors: The Tri-Cities has access to everything you could ever want, but much of it is a long drive away.

"So for context on my bias, I grew up here, moved to Seattle for the better part of a decade, came back about a year ago.

Politically, I consider myself more towards the center on average, pragmatic fiscally, socially liberal.  Here I'm seen as the bleeding heart liberal because I want to fund the fuck out of schools and pre-k education, nutrition programs for kids, etc.  Over in Seattle I was called a Trumper more than once due to thinking that people camping on the sidewalks, shitting on the sidewalks, leaving needles everywhere, etc, was not the ideal scenario.  Crazy, I know.

Here it's just strange politically.  We have the Q-Anon crowd that thinks their crazy stuff, the Trump loyalists who are still flying their flags (I never cared to share that sort of stuff publicly, seems weird at best), and the recent mess with anti-vax/masking and the Richland schools.  Of course, in Seattle, seeing people wearing masks outside is just bizarre too.  Maybe it's best to say that where Seattle's cranking the wheel hard left instead of a measured response to whatever thing is going on, TC cranks it hard right, though there is a vocal minority community, such as those seeking to get the Byirds recalled, so it's not like you're the one person alone here.

Biggest adjustment was I finally felt home again.  Not just because I grew up here, but because people outwardly act normal.  In Seattle, you don't really meet your neighbors.  Here, I knew them all within a week, kid was playing with the rest of the kids in the neighborhood, and all that.  Also, you can leave you car unlocked at night and it's not been ransacked (not every neighborhood, but in even the nicest areas in Seattle, you hide and lock your stuff like there's a meth addict on every corner, or your stuff is gone in the morning).  Beyond that, the idiocy is predictable, and just explained by no bullshit filter, in that they just can't discern reality from fiction, but ok.  Seattle, I still can't fathom why the school district would prevent principals from calling the cops to evict tent camps from their playgrounds.

After that, you have to get used to very little traffic.  People here bitch about it, and that's so cute.  Oh, you took an extra 5 minutes getting home?  At least it's not an hour to go 2 miles, or a 90 minute commute each way, every day.  Sure, we don't have a lot of A-list bands or shows coming here, but I'm not really worried about that.  The fishing and hunting is off the charts compared to the west side.  The roads aren't crammed in, where you're riding both the left and right side lines.  You can ride your bike around your neighborhood, and they have ample space for you and the cars driving, there are sidewalks most everywhere, and people aren't doing 50 mph around blind corners.  

The schools are much better as well, or at least the consistency is there.  At the old one, my kid was ahead of the curve, so they didn't teach her much of anything for the year, we had to augment her education to keep her up to what we thought standards should be.  The last teacher over there actually asked us not to do this, but here, teachers seem to support the parents as much as the parents should be supporting the teachers.  Beyond this, if there's a second language spoken at home for the students, it's just about always spanish, so resources are easy for them, and it won't detract from schooling the kids proficient in english.  Last place had multiple languages spoken at home (english, spanish, somali, arabic, hindi (though indians magically value education and learning the native tongue, weird, I know)), so that was disruptive as well.

No real surprises, other than the insane growth in our absence.  This place is rapidly expanding, no other way to describe it.  Areas I thought wouldn't see development for 25 years are built over, such as south of I-82 in Kennewick.  Real Estate is *much* more expensive than a decade ago, but still half or less than what you'd pay in Seattle, and you get way more bang for the buck.  Negative surprise was that my favorite taco truck went away.  If you're a huge sushi/asian food fan, Seattle is better.  If you like mexican food, this place blows the west side out of the water.  Anyone over there arguing otherwise doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ground.

Regarding the other parts about race, I can't comment on asian experiences firsthand, but having grown up here, and seeing what it's like with my kids, my observations were a bit different, in that yeah, kids/people would see the skin tones or whatever, but beyond that, nobody really cared.  Here if you are pointing someone out in a crowd, you'd say white/mexican as freely as you'd say blond/brown hair.  It's not bad, it's a fact, it doesn't matter, but it is an easy way to play the where's waldo game.  There, I said something along those lines, and the looks were amazing.  I had to pretend that people were clear, which struck me as just bizarre. I'm sure there's white folks afraid of downtown Pasco, but going there, there are plenty of white folks walking around too, so I think that's just when you get to the wrong pockets of town, or the Matlock generation.  A strong mexican presence is one thing I dearly missed about this place, but I'm probably 30% adobada by weight, so I'm a bit biased.

You'll probably drive more, though biking is a lot more accessible than it was 20 years ago.  The weather is *much* better, allowing for more outdoor activities.  The constant September-May drizzle doesn't exist.  It actually freezes in winter which is nice, I prefer 25 and dry or snow to 40 and wet.

If your kid is a teen, they'll complain how boring it is.  Of course, I heard similar from people that grew up in the cities, so I think that's just endemic to the human experience at that age.  It's a great place to raise kids though, much better than Seattle, would definitely recommend it for what you share of your family's situation.",t2_ebm3r3f9,xertshurts,0,1648052975.0,0,t1_i1tag0m,i1tag0m,True,northwesternsamurai,t3_tkjmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/,Can anybody share their experience of moving to the Tri-Cities from western WA?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/i1tag0m/,4,r/TriCitiesWA,0,4

"I've heard Tri Cities described as ""the Florida of Washington"" and it fits beautifully.

The right wing political mania has really flourished out here, especially since 2016. It has gotten to the point that even something as mundane as the local school board meetings (at least in Richland, most notably) have turned into something akin to watching Tucker Carlson. Instead of doing their job, some of the new Trump-era members use it as a battleground for waging the far right culture wars. Just google Richland Washington school board and you'll see articles about how utterly dysfunctional it has become. And the sad/scary thing is, this dysfunction is widely supported and popular out here, and I only expect it to get worse with more wackos elected into office in the coming years.

And along with the right wing prevalence comes the aggressive ""God / guns / get-off-my-lawnism"" that you would expect.

You'd probably see the same dynamics in any rural area these days.

But other than the Don't Tread on Me political extremism that's taking over, it's a pretty nice place to live!

Also mixed - Indian and my wife is super white. 

Best way to describe it is comfortable but boring. 

The best part of moving here for me personally was the low cost of living and being able to drive for fun again, you can‚Äôt really do that on the west side because of traffic. I‚Äôm really enjoying my manual transmission now.

"Ok, caveat that it has been 14 years....

Mixed family (Asian and Caucasian), moved here with one kid now at three.

Biggest adjustment was the highs of the summer heat, not terrible but not normal for people from Seattle either.   The biggest learning curve was figuring out how to operate an irrigation system which I never had to deal with on the westside. :D

I don't know what we were expecting, but really haven't had any issues.  Food might be one, our regular trips back to Seattle include mandatory trips to Uwajimaya and Trader Joe's.  The local Asian stores tend more toward Thai type products probably because of an influx of Burmese refugees in the early 2000s.  There is also a somewhat decent sized Filipino population that has a dedicated market.

The public schools are what you make of them.  We live in one of the poorest areas in Kennewick and have been pleasantly surprised by the schools.  By every testing rating the elementary we are at is terrible, but  that number is impacted by the high percentage of first generation immigrants, if your parents don't speak English it is unsurprisingly tough to catch up education wise.  Our kids have been challenged to learn and our youngest will have the opportunity for dual language learning when he starts kindergarten next year.

I really like the mix of rural and urban, having real Farmer's Markets from local growers is great.  I like my kids being able to see their food being grown.  The outdoor opportunity is great for fishing and ok for hunting, depending on what you hunt for.  Local hiking is somewhat limited, and it feels like getting to a hike/camp with trees around it is always 2 hours away, but the options are fairly amazing.  Heading into the Blues or down into eastern Oregon (the Eagle Caps are amazing) gets you into much less populated forests and wilderness areas compared to the Cascades and Olympics around Seattle.

"Asian here and moved to Tri-Cities for my fellowship at Kadlec in 2018 and moved back. I might have more similar life experience with you.

1) Biggest adjustment is the overall whiteness of the area. I grew up in the Oakland/Alameda, went to undergrad in SoCal and went to UW. All extremely multi-cultural compared to Western Washington. The whiteness stands out completely. There's the usual sense of undercurrent of racism that you'll feel. A patient asked me if I was ""that"" doctor on a magazine that was right next to me even if we didn't look anything unlike. There's definitely a ""We don't' go there"" about Pasco because of the heavy Latin population. There's a lack of culture here, especially in non-white cuisine. There's no real authentic Chinese restaurants and only one Pho place. The pho place doesn't have what I usually eat, like hock, tripe or anything. It's just super bland and watered down for the folks here. 

POCs in the community are pretty open with other POCs and drop their guard pretty quickly. I did some demographic data and it's pretty startling. In 2018,less than 2% of the population is black and less than 4% of the population is Asian in Kadlec's Service Area.  At my fellowship, a person I was doing an informational interview with, talked about the struggle as a WW and BM interracial couple and how it took a bit to get use too. We talked about 'that feeling of otherness"" you get when you walk around and the look the people gave you. It's not an overt, ""Fuck that guy"" but it's there.

2) I think the biggest surprise is how quickly I got around to places and how great the Latin food was. Considering how high my standard was (Oakland baby!), the Mexican/Oaxacan/Yucatan food was exceptional. And I'm not talking about the taco trucks. 

Biggest negative surprise, again, is the lack of culture. There's not much to do after 7 or 8pm other than dive bars.

3) I don't think I ever adjusted. I ended up eating at home more often. Drove back to Seattle every other weekend over my 5 month long fellowship. They offered me a job after my fellowship as a clinic manager, which I politely declined to stay in the organization at Renton.",t2_ebyag,purkour,0,1648007817.0,0,t1_i1r62r5,i1r62r5,True,northwesternsamurai,t3_tkjmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/,Can anybody share their experience of moving to the Tri-Cities from western WA?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/i1r62r5/,8,r/TriCitiesWA,0,8
"Spent the first three decades of my life in western WA along the I-5 corridor (grew up in Kelso, college in Bellingham, ~10 years in the Kirkland area), and moved over here about 5 years ago.  Main impetus of moving was to be closer to my wife's family, and the fact we didn't have the means to get a much bigger house in the Sesttle area.  

Overall, the big changes have been the weather and politics, with restaurants a distant third.  I probably like the weather more here, as fall and spring aren't the 50%+ wet days that they are on the west side.  Politically, it's pretty conservative everywhere, and talking to friends on the west side still about how COVID is going, etc, is a bit eye opening.  And finally, the dining out options are much more limited, with alot more generic chain-style restaurants.  

In the end, I have been happy moving here, but that is in a large part due to getting a nicer house and me being fairly content being a homebody.  Having grandparents within 30 minutes is great too, as we never had that before.  The weather can sometimes be a bit rough, and the right wing dipshits that took over the Richland School Board drive me nuts, but I suppose it's made me more aware of other views and trying to have more conversations outside my bubble.",t2_3fmri,wildo88,0,1648007515.0,0,t1_i1r5j9e,i1r5j9e,True,northwesternsamurai,t3_tkjmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/,Can anybody share their experience of moving to the Tri-Cities from western WA?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/i1r5j9e/,19,r/TriCitiesWA,0,19

"I've lived here most of my life. Lived in Seattle for a few years as well. I'll tell you that the most shocking thing for a number of people who have moved here from other places is two fold: 1) how early everything closes compared to more populous areas, and 2) the wind.


Number 1 doesn't bother me as I don't really go out at night and having lived here forever I'm used to it. However, coming from a more populous area like Seattle, I could see how that would be weird. Be prepared that on Sundays, not much beyond grocery stores are open after 6:00pm. On weekdays, restaurants and bars will stay open until 8:00 or 9:00 (sometimes longer maybe). On Friday and Saturday night, things will stay open until last call, but it's also not uncommon for places to close at 10:00 even if they have a bar. I used restaurants and bars as examples because in other places I've lived they're consistently the places open late at night beyond grocery stores...your mileage may vary. This is pretty much a bedroom community first and foremost. There is not a ton of night life and the entertainment scene is still up and coming (meaning what is here is generally popular and not large in quantity.)


Number 2 bothers me greatly. I've always hated the wind here. Depending on where in the TC you live, there is almost always at least a small breeze (which is pleasant), but it can quickly turn into a windy mess. When I was younger and there weren't so many houses we could get nasty dust storms in town as well as the surrounding areas. Thanks to the rapid growth here, the dust storms are far less frequent, but the wind remains. In the surrounding, more open areas, we've had on multiple occasions major crashes on interstates involving dozens of vehicles due to dust storms. The wind I refer to is 15+ mph sustained and 40+ mph gusts. While it doesn't happen all the time, it's enough that it irritates me. There's a joke here that it's always windy on garbage day. You'll find your trash can, plus a number of your neighbors' cans down the street every week.


As a bonus, my wife didn't develop allergies until we moved back here permanently in the mid 2000's. There are a lot of things to be allergic to here such as Russian Olive trees. The climate here surprises people usually - 300 days of sun with hot/dry summers and sometimes coldish snowy-ish winters (4 out of the last 5 or so have had a surprising amount of snow for this area.)


On the plus side, I moved away from here because I hated it as a kid. After graduating college and living on the east coast for a couple years, I realized that it's a great place to raise a family and moved back. The schools were/are decent and crime is relatively low (again, depending on where you live). There is a high concentration of college, graduate, and post-graduate degrees here and jobs to match. The Hanford site is one of, if not the largest employer in the area so the economy is usually pretty stable. Even during the 2008 housing crisis our home prices remained level or even ticked up slightly. Other large employers are starting to move here and create more variety of jobs and as a result the area is expanding pretty rapidly. There are outdoor things to do such as hunting, golf, hiking, camping, biking, boating, etc. in and around the area. The mountains are 1 to 2 hours away depending on what kind of mountains you're looking for.



With the exception of the fantasy places such as a beach in Hawaii or a cabin on a lake in a mountain forest, there aren't many other places I'd want to live. Being able to work remotely certainly opens up the options, but I haven't yet started searching for alternatives. If you can get past the fact that this area is a bedroom community first and foremost and are still interested then it'll be a good change.",t2_585qkgxj,BasilCraigens,0,1648005736.0,0,t1_i1r29it,i1r29it,True,northwesternsamurai,t3_tkjmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/,Can anybody share their experience of moving to the Tri-Cities from western WA?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/i1r29it/,31,r/TriCitiesWA,0,31

I loved the west side and am glad it is just a few hours away but I won't ever go back to live there.  I immediately began reaping the rewards of a much slower pace here, friendly/approachable neighbors and a different kind of beauty. Sometimes I wonder if the extreme political difference might drive me and my family away at some point, but for now I can see us staying here long term.

"I came from the far-far-far east of the US.

The intensity of the heat was shocking, even compared to having previously lived in inland mid-northern California.

The darkness in the winter was shocking, even having come from a very similar latitude.  The lack of snow and the pressure inversions make for a very very dreary winter.

The 100% suburb feel and the silly unplanned development corridors are ridiculous, but they are what they are.

It's weird being in a pretty far right area, having come from a pretty left one.  At least we're not Spokane Valley, though, electing Matt Shea.  I don't think we're quite so insane.

I've adjusted pretty well.  I can afford to live here a lot better than where I was, and I was able to buy a house just before things really took off, which is nice.

That said, there is a lot of growth and the commutes will become worse. Like others have said, where there's new construction in Kennewick, West Pasco, West Richland, and Richland, they are all fine places to live.

One caution. Some people are bothered by wind. If you live up the hillsides, the wind is worse. We don't really have tornados, but people can lose their roof and have trees downed.

"1. West Richland or in that area they're building new neighbor hoods all the time. West Pasco as well. Stay out of East Pasco that's old and where all the crime is. Pasco generally isn't the most safe. There's reasons why their Walmart has to keep hard alcohol locked up while the Richland/Kennewick Walmart's leave their liquor out in the open. West Richland is old but it's starting to expand rapidly. With planned commercial fun all in the works.
2. It's a generally safe place to live but sometimes people do stupid things. Couple months ago there was a Drive-by shooting in Kennewick but it was someone from out of town and that's a rare instance. There's a lot of fun here despite what people say. More so perhaps before covid but there's still events and stuff to do and explore. We have a nice Fair every August and Hydroplane Races in July. There's plenty of hiking trails, golfing, cinemas, the Toyota Center gets some good shows and it's not too far of a drive for some big casinos or Silverwood in Idaho if you like rollercoasters.

The Myrtles Plantation: Murder, Mystery, and Magic ‚ÄìDocumentary Feature ‚Äì USA  
Director:¬† Ericka Boussarhane  
Running Time:¬†42:21m   
Website: https://www.secondsighttv.com/  

In St. Francisville, Louisiana lies the picturesque Myrtles Plantation. Situated 26 miles from Baton Rouge, it may not be the grandest of plantations, but what it lacks in presentation, it makes up for in disturbing history and lore. Owned by the Moss family, it‚Äôs touted as one of the most haunted places in America! Visitors have reported seeing apparitions, lights turning on and off, faces and handprints in mirrors, vanishing objects; hearing random footsteps, rattling doorknobs, children‚Äôs cries and unexplained smells.   

The Myrtles Plantation has been featured on ‚ÄúGhost Hunters,‚Äù ‚ÄúGhost  
Adventures,‚Äù‚Äù Unsolved Mysteries‚Äù and ‚ÄúMost Terrifying Places in America.‚Äù¬† But is this plantation the paranormal hotspot it‚Äôs claimed to be? Does it hold the dark and tragic history of poisonings, hangings, mutilation, murder, and gunfire claimed? Can fact be separated from  
fiction? Ericka and her team are about to find out.",t2_699lijv,Natmandu71,0,1647967667.0,0,t1_i1oj39e,i1oj39e,True,Natmandu71,t3_tk7a8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tk7a8q/trifi_trailer_tuesday/,TRIFI Trailer Tuesday...,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tk7a8q/trifi_trailer_tuesday/i1oj39e/,1,r/TriCitiesWA,0,1

"The problem with central Richland is the hit or miss nature of the WWII era alphabet houses.  Mostly rentals and run down, let's just say Tri Cities in general has a lower class drug culture that can make whole areas suspect or pockets of not so nice areas.  Unfortunately the apartments with high amounts of state subsidized renters do tend to skew towards problem renters. A lot of this can also have to do with the quality of the rental management company.

The area in Richland between Jadwin and George Washington way is pretty questionable for apartments in general unless you are north of Snyder or at least Jadwin Stevens and their immediate neighbors keep the rif-raff at bay per management.

Columbia Park apartments (called ""the stilts"" for as long as I can remember) are extra ghetto and cops are always there.  

I always say before you rent a place go to the local minimart/7-11 and check out the clientele.  The shit I have seen at the 7-11 next to the stilts will blow your mind.

"I actually also have one of the manual collars (iQ Mini) and yes, the vibe or zap will bring him in usually. Same deal if my other neighbor's dog is out; just takes a few more pings to get mine to come back in. Works quite well!

The thing is, even if I'm diligent about making sure he's wearing it and listening for barking, I can't have the doggy door open all the time like I have been. I may feel like I'm responding quickly when I get a text from the neighbor, but I think the point is the neighbor feels they shouldn't even have to text me in the first place. Not having a dog incessantly barking every time you're in the back yard is not an unreasonable thing to want, and as much as I would like to allow my dog to go in an out whenever, I should respect that. 

I have concluded that, until/unless I can really work on training him not to react to strangers the way he does, it's best to just remove the doggy door and go back to letting him out periodically. As others have said, with a potential poisoner in the neighborhood, it's that much more for the best for now.

"The hands free bark collars were not the solution.  We do keep a manually triggered one on our Dog and we escalate the ""training"" from noise, vibration and then zap mode.  Normally the vibration or zap mode will bring him running inside.  But if the neighbor dog is barking it may take a few pulses to get the point across.

When my dog is focused on a noise, nothing will stop her from barking and I have to physically go out there and grab her, and that got very annoying. 

What I did was changed up my system a bit and it may work for you -
I never let her outside when I‚Äôm going to be too busy to deal (going to the bathroom, taking a shower, important call, etc.) I took it a step further and put her out on a 30‚Äô lead.

"Seconding getting the dog inside, better trained, and also investing in a bark collar. 

If your dog cannot stop barking when he's outside and it's enough of a nuisance to disturb your neighbors, and they've told you this multiple times before, they're definitely well within their rights to proceed with filing a formal complaint against you for violating the noise ordinance. If I were in their shoes, I would have already done this. 


Usually, if they call animal control or the police about a dog barking incessantly, they'll issue a warning to you and that's about it, unless they can see the animal poses a threat to the public. If they come out a second time, you could be given a citation, so be forewarned.


There's plenty of options for bark collars that help correct a dog without harming them, like ones that vibrate or even release a strong unpleasant (to dogs) scent instead of shocking, but in my own experience owning a bark-happy dog, it only takes a day or so of wearing the vibrating bark collar before he learned ""barking = weird thing on my neck buzzes like a bumblebee on crack"" üòÖ


One last thing, you may also want to do something as a peace offering to your neighbor as well, like a gift card to a local restaurant or maybe a batch of cookies plus an apology letter.

There is a definite uptick in our community as of late, as it has been around the United States.  I travel a few times a year for my job and no matter the state (red or blue) or city there are tent cities and camper communes propping up.

I was in San Francisco earlier this week and I saw on their local news that they have been building the Tiny House villages and have had reasonable success in them.  It allows an unsheltered person to have access to a small kitchenette, a single bed, a toilet, running water, electricity, and a US mailing address.

"I forgot to include prices. My current rental is $1,400 for a 3 bedroom. The house I rented from Patty was $1,400 for a 2 bedroom. The place from Gary was $900 for a 2 bedroom (it did not even have 3-pronged electrical sockets) . The place also reeked of cigarettes all the time and people did not pick up after their dogs at the property. Feces were carried into the communal areas and the washer and dryer did not work well. He has a tendency to also steal your deposit and hike up your deposit if you're hispanic (like over $2,000).  I brought it up with the city, but they said they can't remove him as a landlord unless crime was committed at the apartment complex. 

Patty deducted $600 from my deposit for trimming her trees (which wasn't in the lease). Many landlords are awful, here.

"Prosser itself is a really difficult market to find \*decent\* housing in. I have personally rented from two slumlords. DO NOT rent from Gary Adkins ([bbb.org/us/wa/selah/profile/rental-listings/adkins-rental-properties-1296-1000075765](https://bbb.org/us/wa/selah/profile/rental-listings/adkins-rental-properties-1296-1000075765)) or Patty Escamilla. The homes are really old and many get flipped with very cheap changes. The home I rented from Patty only had one shower in the master bedroom and the countertops were painted on. She also told me not to flush toilet paper because the pipes are old.   


With my current housing in Prosser, I got fortunate and found housing with some ethical folks. The other issue is if you have pets. Cats are not really welcome for some reason.

TL;DR. Save copies of your lease and be prepared to take them to small claims court. If you do take them small claims, sue them for double the amount because you will have to take them to collections and collections agencies take 40% off your claim.

"Bugging CenturyLink repeatedly jumping around their phone tree until you finally get somewhere might be your best hope.  Even see if you were paying for ""business fiber"" what they would quote as a build cost.

Coax would be ran by Charter and owned by them not CL, so if you were to order POTS (telephone) from CenturyLink how would that work?  I think its worth asking those questions!

What tends to happen is by law CL has to provide you service, so when they realize they have to build \*something\* sometimes it ends up as fiber *(thats how it worked out for that  buddy of mine after pressing on them for a while)*.  So I'd try to bypass the first level 1-800 lowbies and get to someone who can actually help you!  Good luck!

"I applied for the same type of RCT trainee position 5 years ago and got through the interview process although they ended up  hiring me for another position because of my degree.  Anyway, if this hiring process goes anything like the last few trainee classes they've had then I'm pretty familiar with it.  

Because the actual job prerequisites are pretty 'low' (high school diploma, no experience) there is likely to be a ton of applicants.  For the class I applied to, I was told it was hundreds.  That said, they had every willing applicant take an initial knowledge test that covered very basic math and science.  They then interviewed **every person** who scored an 80% or more on this test.  Luckily beforehand they sent every applicant a package of information they should study.  Study for the test!!  A lot of applicants didn't take it seriously and just winged it.  If you really want the job, study hard and do well on this test.  Everything on the test is in that package of information.  The test isn't so much to see how smart you are, it's to see if you can study and put in the footwork to do well.

It is possible they don't do it this way anymore but I worked for a few years in the group that did the hiring for these RCTs and this is how they always did it when I was there.",t2_63951,fivefeetoffury,0,1646799747.0,0,t1_hzxlrph,hzxlrph,True,chancesarent,t3_t9qkn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/t9qkn6/if_anyone_is_looking_for_a_good_union_job_wrps_at/,"If anyone is looking for a good union job, WRPS at Hanford is hiring RCT trainees",/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/t9qkn6/if_anyone_is_looking_for_a_good_union_job_wrps_at/hzxlrph/,13,r/TriCitiesWA,0,13
