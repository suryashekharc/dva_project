One thing I will say is that the building seems oddly quiet.

"‚ÄúMoreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠I Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠15:1-4‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Idk what you believe in but please consider believing in Jesus and His life, death on the cross, and resurrection for your sins. If you‚Äôre a true believer, then good. That shooting at Kermit‚Äôs is just a reminder how we can be dead in an instant. 

Jesus saves. Repent of your sins and believe the gospel. No good work you do can save you and make you righteous before God, only the blood of Jesus that washes away past, present, and future sins. Seek forgiveness from God believing in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We‚Äôre not guaranteed tomorrow. Eternity last forever, if you‚Äôre not trusting in Jesus for your salvation but instead you‚Äôre trusting in your own goodness (your good works), then you‚Äôre only gonna end up in hell, sounds harsh but it‚Äôs facts. No good works can save you. No religious activity can save you. Only Jesus can. Turn to Him and call out to Him for forgiveness. Begin a relationship with Jesus and God the Father. Jesus lived a perfect life on this earth while He was fully human, but also, He was fully God too. Jesus is God. That‚Äôs why He was able to remain sinless, but because He took on the likeness of human flesh, Jesus death on the cross was the perfect sacrifice for all our sins. Jesus was risen by God 3 days later after Jesus died on the cross. Jesus is alive and is coming back. We all going to stand before Jesus. Whoever reading this, the ball is in your court. Realize that you and I aren‚Äôt good people at all because we sinned against an infinitely Holy God and we deserve death for paying for our sins in hell (apart from God) for eternity. God doesn‚Äôt want no one to perish in Hell. Please accept His free gift of Salvation by believing in (having faith, trusting) in the finished work of Jesus Christ for your sins aka repent of your sins and believe the gospel. Nothing can save your soul from eternal damnation except believing in Jesus and His finished work on the cross. And lastly, the gospel doesn‚Äôt give you a license to sin all you want. If you truly believe in the gospel, you wouldn‚Äôt want to sin because you‚Äôre grateful for what God has done by offering you salvation.

"Am in the process of this right now. Went the permitting route to finish installation of a bathroom in a partially finished basement. 

Haven't gotten to inspections yet, but have learned a ton about the right way to do things. Doing all ourselves, but it's just a half bath so no shower or tub to fool with. But still have framing, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical to pass. Each costs a separate fee on top of the general permit.

Highly recommend adding more to your budget to accommodate for cost of permits and what you will have to do (correctly) to pass inspections. 

Also you can get a list of all the inspectors for the trades and call the supervisors with questions you may have. That's online or you can get a paper copy at the downtown permitting office. 

You will be amazed at the efficiency of the government as well, throughout the entire process /s

"I would avoid used car lots in general, you are basically guaranteeing you're going to get ripped off.

Cars are very much my fort√©, I'm an independent mechanic and I've owned and fixed up lots of used cars.

Most anime isn't ""naughty bits"", most are just traditional stories in every genre from sci fi to sitcom, and kids to adult audience. Your comment qualifying you don't watch the ""naughty"" stuff is simply is unnecessary and confusing and somewhat implies everyone else is watching the naughty stuff if they like anime.

"That is such an amazing calculator, more people need to know about it. Wow! It takes into account a lot of things most people interested in entering the market wouldn't think about.

In my situation, though, I have moved once per year for the last 4 years for jobs or other opportunities. I'm making more money each move, especially with COL considered, but that would mean, by that calculator, I should essentially never purchase a home even until I'm ready to live in one spot for 4+ years!

Unfortunately it‚Äôs unlikely home prices or rent will go down soon. The dynamic is very different than 2008. In 2008 there was a perfect storm of sub prime mortgages and gen X (the smallest generation)  hitting prime buying age. 
Now the much larger millennial generation are in their 30s and buying, while older people are staying in their homes longer than previous generations. 
I would be happy to send you some more info on this and link you with an amazing independent mortgage broker.

"Assuming you are a resident - Ardmore is your best bet (by hospital. However, it is not your easiest or cheapest bet, competition is high.

I personally would prefer living in West End (walk to both downtown and hospital) but it is near impossible to find a house for sale that‚Äôs appropriate for a resident. In part because there are so few, but also because most of them are too large.

West Salem / Arcadia has some hidden gems, but is a lot more hit-or-miss than the other neighborhoods around downtown. The second house we got beat out on was in Arcadia, it was incredible value/quality and I was really disappointed to not get it tho my wife prefers the Ardmore location. 

There are many additional areas to look for houses but they become further from the hospital than you‚Äôd like if you want to really feel like you live in Winston and/or they become very bland suburbs.

I did not mention Buena Vista / Robinhood / Reynolda / Country Club because even a lot of attendings can‚Äôt afford those lol.

"I went to college in Greensboro for a few years and I‚Äôm very familiar with Winston, both cities have a similar feel. There are definitely a few differences, though. 

Winston‚Äôs location is closer to the mountains, and I think that matters to an extent. If you think about it, Winston is the closest large city to the northwestern corner of the state as far west as Boone. Many of those residents from counties like Yadkin, Surry, and Wilkes visit Winston for amenities like shopping, restaurants, etc. Combine this with Pilot Mountain and Hanging Rock nearby, and the Appalachian influences around Winston become more noticeable. I‚Äôm not saying Winston is a legit Appalachian city because it isn‚Äôt, but the influences are there.

Greensboro is more of a classic Carolina Piedmont city. A small downtown surrounded by suburban sprawl, known for textiles, etc. It‚Äôs also centrally located between Charlotte and the Triangle, so there seems to be a lot more traffic passing through Greensboro as opposed to Winston. 

Also, if Greensboro is Raleigh, then Winston is Durham. Winston has a grittier vibe and really feels like a factory town in certain sections.

"Winston Salem is being taken over by the university, which is bringing in educated professionals from all over the country as well as money to the town. WS has more inequality and gentrification, which is especially visible near the university and downtown. WS is also closer to the mountains and has a slight Appalachian culture. 

Greensboro has a larger art scene, and a more diverse economy than Winston Salem. Significantly more Greensboro residents are from the city or state. The culture is much more like other southern urban centers like Durham, Columbia, or Virginia Beach. Greensboro is a slightly larger city and has more demographic diversity. 

Both cities are relatively safe, affordable, and have similar location benefits. However, Winston Salem is going through a significant period of change right now and will probably be different in 5-10 years. It is important to consider that these are two pretty separated cities and people don‚Äôt travel between them as often as you might think.",t2_69yqz2k,virgji15,0,1647895080.0,0,t1_i1krr8l,i1krr8l,True,kingcarleon3vol,t3_tjf2ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/winstonsalem/comments/tjf2ud/is_there_a_culture_difference_between_greensboro/,Is there a culture difference between Greensboro and Winston?,/r/winstonsalem/comments/tjf2ud/is_there_a_culture_difference_between_greensboro/i1krr8l/,37,r/winstonsalem,0,37

"Monstercade is my go to. It's very loud/ bright and kind of an eclectic trashy vibe (in a good way). Shows wvery weekend too! I'm going to the one this weekend, I think its punk but don't quote me on that. 

Gas Hill is a good bar for music too. A lot smaller and quieter, I'm not sure if they're open on nights without concerts, it's attached to the ramkat.

If you're looking for somewhere quieter where you can sit alone and people watch the sofa lounge is great for cocktails.

Footnotes is nice. Part bar, part coffee shop, and connected to a bookstore. They tend to do live jazz music but it's not the main focus like the other music spots I've mentioned.

Reboot is also fun! Cheap arcade machines and a small bar.

"Anyone who works in your home is a W-2 employee and is subject to labor laws such a minimum wage (and I realize you are paying more than that ‚Äî this is in reference to your $2/hr comment).

I‚Äôm really sorry if the people you worked for in the past didn‚Äôt pay you at LEAST a fair wage, if you were working in their home. You can actually pursue that after the fact, if needed.

If they were bringing their children to you, in your home, then it was up to you to set a rate that was livable for you, but you can‚Äôt insist upon care in YOUR home and get the extremely low rate. It just doesn‚Äôt work that way.

You may have to find a nice grandmotherly type who is already retired and doesn‚Äôt have formal childcare experience, or someone who brings their own children along with them to care for yours. You MIGHT be able to find a college kid who‚Äôs in classes on the opposite schedule of yours. 

But your best best is going to be to call every single licensed home daycare in town and see if they can take your twins, and work out something different for your school-age child.

"I‚Äôm going to be very honest with you, as a childcare professional: you are not offering enough compensation for in-home care and transportation. For just the two younger children, and an experienced candidate, you‚Äôre looking at $15-18/hr minimum IF it were a full time position. Because it is part time (and that would prevent any candidate from getting an alternate full-time position), you need to pay FAR more. Probably $25-30/hr, once you figure in the driving required.

Try searching for a licensed home daycare or commercial daycare here:

You may need to consider separate care after-school for your older one, as well. Does their school offer anything? Have you checked with local churches who offer after school with transport? Have you tried the Boys & Girls club?

I just use city lots and parking spaces and it‚Äôs never been so crowded in Winston Salem that there wasn‚Äôt a space. That said, it‚Äôs still an added cost that businesses have to take into account whether customers will be willing to pay to park on a regular basis.",t2_gw89mhz4,ItypeslowerthanGRRM,0,1647727581.0,0,t1_i1bzr1g,i1bzr1g,False,gratefulem220,t3_tfvocn,https://www.reddit.com/r/winstonsalem/comments/tfvocn/fake_parking_tickets/,Fake parking tickets??,/r/winstonsalem/comments/tfvocn/fake_parking_tickets/i1bzr1g/,1,r/winstonsalem,0,1
"Neither towing or the app based remote enforcement is very good in my opinion. If you get towed they charge you storage too. Major profit motive either way. Several downtown property managers have the towing company on speed dial. That said, I see the frustration of the local businesses and it really pisses my off when someone calls the owners of Sweet Potatos, Foothills, or Camel City scammers. They are just dealing with a shitty situation the best way available at the time. The app based parking is better than towing, as at least  you can call and challenge them.

"I think the problems start because the third party enforcing parking rules has a profit motive to be overzealous with their enforcement, so may be catching legitimate customers of the businesses who should be able to park there for free. That has also been a persistent problem with tow trucks enforcing parking. The non-standard payment, having to use a random app or website to pay, introduces another issue in that you have to have an internet connection on the spot, and no technical difficulties. Add to that the company you have to contact if you do have a problem being out of state, and you‚Äôre bound to have bad results.

"The NCDOT data is very clear, 10-20% annual increase in Amtrak ridership from the previous year. There is demand for this service. I only pay $8.50 because I pay a 10 pack of tickets and get a big discount. Normal fare is $13-15 depending on time of day. Still my experience is anecdotal and we should base these assessments on ridership data, which again, suggests Amtrak service should be expanded so that more commuters can use it. Northeast corridor routes between DC all the way up to Boston are extremely profitable for Amtrak so we should continue invest in options like passenger rail because it gives people more commuting options, gets cars off the strained highways, and is more environmentally responsible.",t2_nlv7z,ronnoc_the_mighty,0,1647647495.0,0,t1_i17y1vh,i17y1vh,False,[deleted],t3_tgo3v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/winstonsalem/comments/tgo3v3/trains_and_winstonsalem/,Trains and Winston-Salem,/r/winstonsalem/comments/tgo3v3/trains_and_winstonsalem/i17y1vh/,1,r/winstonsalem,0,1

"As a primer to those that don‚Äôt want to wade through all the opinion and nonsense here‚Äôs quick summary.  
In the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù businesses would post a sign that said something like ‚Äú parking for purposes not related to business x would result in a towing fee of n‚Äù and in fine print would say ‚Äúand a storage fee of n per day until your vehicle was collected‚Äù. Enforcement of that required a person checking the lot and calling the towing company. Still many businesses do this to this day.  
Because many businesses didn‚Äôt have enough time to monitor the lots and call the tow trucks people rampantly abused their parking, so their legitimate customers often had nowhere to park.  
Companies moved in that offered video surveillance to enforce parking because there weren‚Äôt enough people to watch the lots physically. This seemed ‚Äúnicer‚Äù than towing because instead of having to retrieve your vehicle from an impound lot you paid through the ‚Äúmail‚Äù.  
Then entered various righteous people that declared because they didn‚Äôt actually seize your vehicle you didn‚Äôt have to pay for parking.  
Now, all of this would be totally unnecessary if everyone would simply be decent human beings and not use parking not intended for them. No one wants towing, tickets, etc. Use a ramp, pay for a stall. Parking isn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be free.  
This entire thread would be unnecessary if people simply acted responsibly. Businesses wouldn‚Äôt need to contract enforcers.

And yes, it's a random sign.  Can I put a sign on my driveway saying pull in and you owe me $500? Yes or no.  It's the same concept, and the answer for both is no.

I also can not then call a collections agency and tell them you owe me $500.  

And no, they aren't getting your address information from the DoT, again, this is them trying to appeal to some authority and fool you.

Go to [searchquarry.com](https://searchquarry.com) for example  Enter your own license plate.

"Well, since it is legal in NC good luck ignoring the ticket. They are getting your address from the DOT so they have state backing. If you don't pay it'll go to collections, and then end up on your credit report. 

So you can make all the self-rightious statements you want to the credit card company when your rates go up. Good luck with that.

It's not a ""random sign"" it's marking the rules for private property. You are using someone's private property for it's commercial purpose, i.e. parking.

"Let me add what OP should have instead of simply linking to another post.

Empower let's drivers set their own rates so in theory gas should already be priced in to the rates a particular driver charges. 

I don't know what lyft going to do but Uber is adding a 55c surcharge to all rides and 45c to all eats orders. This is a fixed amount and not tied to mileage. 

I can't speak for all drivers but for the foreseeable future I am vowing not to surge on empower. Not only is it good business, with the measly surges in ws coupled with the measly min earnings on Uber, I still make more on empower..

Some highlights of empower vs uber/lyft.

Empower shows drivers the entire job up front including earnings and what you pay is what we make. Uber and lyft only show us where we are  picking you up. Because of this I am more than willing to take every ride on empower, I regularly pick up someone in Clemmons/Lewisville/King/etc because I can see if they are headed in a direction I want to be and I am paid fairly for those miles.",t2_itmxk,rdyoung,0,1647417639.0,0,t1_i0uyvjm,i0uyvjm,True,TesselateLLC,t3_tf8ypa,https://www.reddit.com/r/winstonsalem/comments/tf8ypa/uberlyftempower/,uber/lyft/empower,/r/winstonsalem/comments/tf8ypa/uberlyftempower/i0uyvjm/,4,r/winstonsalem,0,4
