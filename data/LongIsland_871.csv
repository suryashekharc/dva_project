"You do realize the electricity to recharge an electric car is NOT free, right? When you plug into the grid at home, you'll jack up your home's electricity bill thru the roof instead, so you'll save nothing. There is a fuel surcharge on your electricity bill that reacts to the cost of fuels required to produce energy, also. It isn't like plugging in a coffee maker. Your home may also not have adequate wiring to handle plugging in an electric car, so you may have to spend over a grand on an electrician to come out to tap into your meter box. Another side note: if you buy a used electric vehicle and the batteries die, it will most likely cost more than what you paid for the car to replace the batteries. You don't get to go down to the local AutoZone or Walmart for an el-cheapo 12 volt battery. Really take the time to research what you'd be getting into. If you can afford payments and insurance on a new Tesla, you can afford gas prices we have now with an everyday gas burner. If miles per gallon are important, just get a more fuel efficient gas burner sedan.",t2_8xjdqqpb,NotYourTypicalChad78,0,1648271022.0,0,t1_i25rk33,i25rk33,False,DDP886,t3_tf5lak,https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/tf5lak/how_much_gas_have_you_been_spending_every_week/,How much gas have you been spending every week??,/r/longisland/comments/tf5lak/how_much_gas_have_you_been_spending_every_week/i25rk33/,1,r/longisland,0,1

"25 years is a lot of fucking time and this bitch deserves that at the least, but what's the average sentence in NYS for 1st degree murder? I would have to assume that it would be longer than 25 years. Given that one charge is more severe than the other. 

I never said anything about NYS injustices when it comes to lawyers people can afford, silly drug charges and sentences etc. I'm not an expert on the matter, but I know the issues exist and didn't say that those issues weren't real.

You can prove your point without being disrespectful. I'm not going to parade around claiming to be a criminal justice/legal expert. Did I claim to have passed the NYS bar exam? I was just putting in my two cents (this is fucking reddit after all, that's all people do) Debate me and prove me wrong all you want, I don't mind a fun debate and I'll accept and acknowledge that I'm not well versed in the matter.

[Via CURBED](https://www.curbed.com/2022/03/killenworth-russia-long-island-spy.html) 

On Saturday, Long Island Republicans called on the Biden administration to expel the potential residents of Killenworth, a palatial, Russian-owned estate in Glen Cove — and an alleged spy hub. (“One of the things that is most disconcerting is the fact that we have no idea what they’re doing behind these walls, what kind of nefarious activities they could be engaged in,” said Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman over the weekend.) Since it was first purchased by the Soviet Union in 1946, the suburban compound has been a source of tension both geopolitical (Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro used it as a retreat) and local (it was once subject to a ban on free beach passes). 

In 1897, Killenworth was just a big house. It was demolished in 1912 by George Dupont Pratt, son of Pratt University founder and oil industrialist Charles Pratt, and replaced by what can only be described as a bigger house. The new mansion — on 39.5 acres, containing 49 rooms, and featuring a swimming pool, a tennis court, multiple greenhouses, a garage, and gardens tended by 50 gardeners — was named Country Life in America magazine’s “House of the Year” in 1914. In the accompanying profile, Pratt told the magazine that “if he were building again he would have no change to make in the house.” This impressed the publication, which went on to note that “such an expression of satisfaction takes on a greater significance when applied to a house the size of Killenworth.” For the honor of having a big house he felt very satisfied with, Pratt was awarded $1,000.

The U.S.S.R. bought the estate, intended as a retreat for aides and diplomats, in 1946. The New York Times write-up of the transaction referred to the grounds as “sumptuous.” As the New York Post reported this week, Khrushchev was met during a visit in the 1960s with sprawling protests and signs reading “Pig Fat Murderer” and “Chubby Russian Hangman.”

A former Glen Cove mayor told Newsday that he remembers the event from his childhood. “People lined the streets,” he said. “They were throwing tomatoes at the limos. People were not happy at the time that he was coming in there.” (A photo of Khrushchev at Killenworth, staring blankly at the property, can be found here.)

Killenworth, which is exempt under diplomatic consular status, doesn’t pay taxes. In 1982, according to the New York Times, Glen Cove’s mayor assessed that the city was losing “almost $25,000 a year in taxes, while the school district is losing $50,000 a year and Nassau County $25,000 a year.” The issue came to a head in the 1980s after federal officials claimed Russia was using the estate as a spy mansion.

“We don’t want to be subsidizing the Soviet’s espionage activities here in Glen Cove,” the mayor said, and the Glen Cove City Council voted to revoke the Russians’ free beach passes and discounted tennis and golf course permits. One dissenting member of the council called the move “petty.” A Glen Cove resident told the press at the time that they were pleased with the move because they claimed that when the Russians played tennis, they “would never throw your ball back if it accidentally went into their court.”

The State Department got involved, imploring Glen Cove’s mayor to lift the ban. A press officer with the Soviet Embassy told the Times that the feud was “absolutely unnecessary” and that Glen Cove had to decide if it would “abide by well-respected international law or not.” The Soviets retaliated by banning American diplomats from a beach near Moscow. The dispute ultimately ended a couple of years later, and the council lifted the ban.

In 2016, Barack Obama shut down a different Russian compound on Long Island — this time in the village of Upper Brookville — in response to allegations of Russian interference in the election. The FBI, according to the Times, mistakenly announced it had shuttered Killenworth, which wasn’t true. It was simply the other Russian compound — the Norwich House that sits on 14 acres an 11-minute drive away.

It’s unclear how many people currently live there aside from a few Russian caretakers. It’s a mystery even to the city’s mayor. “My understanding is that they use it for the U.N. Ambassador,” she told Newsday in an email. “The Russian compound is still in use in Glen Cove. I do not know how many people live there or anything else about it but they are there.”

When asked for comment by the Post, a representative for the United Nations pretty much asked to be left out of it, saying, “This is really an issue between the Russian Mission to the U.N. and the U.S. authorities.”",t2_7rhqltgk,PenisDotvin,0,1648249882.0,0,t1_i24mr39,i24mr39,True,[deleted],t3_to508r,https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/to508r/glen_cove_killenworth_mansion_the_espionage/,"[Glen Cove] Killenworth mansion - the ""espionage mansion"" purchased by the Soviet Union in 1946 - Occupants have returned Obama's expulsion of all residents in 2016",/r/longisland/comments/to508r/glen_cove_killenworth_mansion_the_espionage/i24mr39/,1,r/longisland,0,1

"> Would you list the quick fixes made by the US? So far, I have seen none aside from asking Saudi Arabia to produce more fuel.

The US State Department is looking to quickly restore the Iran no-nuke agreement.  Iran has tons of available oil reserves, and needs the cash as well.  They're also looking to patch things up with Venezuela.  That will increase crude oil availability, but that won't mean pricing relief any time soon, because US refinery capacity is maxed.

> Your statements of doom and gloom do not justify the current crisis.

There is no current oil crisis.  The planet Earth has more than enough oil production capacity to resolve this pricing issue in weeks, without Russia's production.  The current oil shortage is artificially created by taking Russia off the Western oil market, and that Saudi Arabia prefers to let the US suffer high prices.  Increasing US oil production willynilly will not resolve our pricing issue now.

> The oil supply is “sufficient” only if you are willing to make people lose their homes. 

More people lost their homes in 2007-2009 from reckless financial industry speculation, than from oil prices in 2006.

"It’s not goalposts, it’s the same thing. 

I should have been clearer and pointed out the EXTENSIVE history of eminent domain cases going through black OR working class or impoverished communities in general, but it follows the same line of reasoning.

For instance it’s been extremely common for institutions that used eminent domain, would argue that a proposed project would “remove blight,” (code for poor people) or “replenish a community,” (gentrification)  or “extinguish negroes.” 

It’s just a matter of fact that the eminent domain tool used by large corporations and the US state has been used as an undemocratic means of exploitation on communities that don’t have the means to fight back.

As odd as it sounds coming out of my mouth, Tesla will probably not be significant in the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.  Even with his expanding capacity, no one (except the dummies) are expecting him to produce all the electric cars.  Electric car availability for consumers will have to be resolved by the *entire* car industry.  The only reason why GM has only *started* getting off of its ass is that they grasp where the future of the market is going.  Toyota can't be counted on to **quickly** drive the conversion to electric, because they put their investment egg into hybrids.  

If we wait 20-30 years to convert to electric cars and reduce our fossil fuel consumption, it will be too late.

"I grew up in Oceanside, currently living in Lynbrook and have belonged to most of these gyms at one point or another.

Oceanside NYSC - has good equipment in great condition, but can get a little crowded at peak hours.

Retro Oceanside - same as Oceanside NYSC really, but the parking situation there is not great, the tile business next door will try to tow your car if you park in their spots during business hours.

Synergy Lynbrook - Admittedly I've only gone to the Baldwin Synergy, but my main gripe with that location was it was constantly crowded, but I leave right near Synergy Lynbrook and it doesn't seem to get too crowded so possibly worth scoping out?

5 Corners Lynbrook - this is my current gym. Staff is really nice and personable. Used to be a gold's gym so they got a lot of equipment granted it's not all in pristine condition. Gym goers are all very friendly. You won't get a lot of crazy perks here, but this is the best example of a mom and pop gym in my opinion which is why I still go here.

"Democrats are blaming the problems that they created on everyone else but themselves!  Joe Biden said, ""Number one, no more subsidies for fossil fuel industry. No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one.""  Biden made iit clear while campaigning that he was going to declare war on America's oil and gas industries. He reversed President Trump’s energy policies in his first week in office, Within a year, our country was no longer energy independent. We're now dependent on other countries (including enemies)to meet our country’s demand for oil and gas!  When President Trump was in office, production increased. We became a net exporter of energy, supplied the market with oil and gas, and the prices dropped!  Biden reversed that.

"Republican Representative LaTurner (Kansas) said in a recent television ad: The Keystone XL pipeline ""would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what we import from Russia. President Biden's energy agenda has strengthened Putin at the expense of hard-working Kansans.""

The transport capacity of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Biden canceled, would have been about 830,000 barrels per day — more than the amount of oil being imported to the United States from Russia. But it’s not as simple as substituting one source for the other. 

The pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, so it couldn’t have solved today’s demand needs. Even in the future, there would be no certainty that the pipeline could produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day, rather than just transporting oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way. Nor would producers be obligated to sell that entire amount to the U.S.

And Keystone is Canadian shale oil sludge.  Much better regions for the US to tap actual crude oil from.  And no, it would not have really lowered US gas prices, but would have made the owners money selling the refined oil overseas.

"So, you recognize that trans people are more vulnerable and at higher risk for suicide, yet you think that hate speech against and already-vulnerable population shouldn't be a thing? Makes so much sense.

One of Shawn's biggest anti-trans points per his latest rant  are that (1) a gender-neutral bathroom is disgusting, and (2) trans women will rape if they're allowed in women's bathrooms. Trans people  already experience physical and sexual assault at a much rate than the rest of the population, so this is potentially increasing their vulnerability.

He also opposes any kind of social-emotional learning in schools. His followers acknowledge that there is a serious mental health crisis post-COVID; as a teacher and parent, I completely agree. However, they think that the masks are to blame, and they spread the misinformation that any extra social-emotional supports are (1) shady ""COVID"" money, and (2) a way to sneak CRT into schools.

In 2008, 7 Patchogue ""teenagers"" were ""hunting for beaners"", except for one of their pals, who stabbed the legal immigrant to death.

"It makes more sense to produce oil locally than to import it from overseas. The reduction in fuel used to transport it alone would be a reduction in demand.

Targeting supply is only going to send prices higher and make people suffer. Targeting demand so that people stop burning oil would be far better. For example, getting geothermal heat pump installations to be a regular thing when oil heating systems need to be replaced or having electric cars replace gasoline cars when gasoline cars are replaced would make plenty of sense, but rather than try to push production of such things so that it is possible, they are just strangling domestic supplies of fossil fuels, which got us into this high price mess.

It would do wonders if they pushed for high temperature geothermal heat pumps to become regularly available for hydronic heating, yet try getting geothermal heating and you are going to be told that your entire system needs to be replaced with either vents that send hot air against the natural direction in which it flows or expensive radiant heating. It just is not feasible.

Even if heating oil became too expensive to afford, a geothermal heat pump would likely not be installed at my house due to the issues that I highlighted. We would instead switch to an electric boiler, which is much less efficient in terms of how much energy from the fuel (at the power plant in this case) is converted into useful heat. Right now, we have 87% efficiency. Using an electric boiler would give us less than 50% efficiency when you take into account the combined efficiency of the natural gas power plants and the electric grid.

That said, there are two horrors here. One is the idiotic thinking that got us into this mess. The second is the push back that occurs when someone points out the causes of our problems. Even Elon Musk thinks we need to stop strangling domestic production and he has dedicated himself to the elimination of demand for fossil fuels.

There is likely some irony here too. I drive a Tesla and have solar panels that power 101% of my household’s yearly electric usage. I have been trying to switch my heat to a geothermal heat pump for years, but the situation there is not good. Almost everyone pushing back on my description of the problems likely have no solar panels, drive gas guzzlers and have done zero research into how they could heat their homes in a better way. I likely use less heat per year on my home too thanks to my improved insulation + air tightness, ventless dryer and use of a programmable thermostat. That difference is because support for stupid decisions in how we handle our energy problems is often a way by which people avoid thinking about what they can do themselves. They then ridicule anyone who points it out rather than face the reality that the decisions are stupid.",t2_mxbm1,ryao,0,1648186698.0,0,t1_i215qok,i215qok,False,healthyspheres,t3_tn43wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/tn43wk/oil_prices_are_nuts/,Oil prices are nuts,/r/longisland/comments/tn43wk/oil_prices_are_nuts/i215qok/,2,r/longisland,0,2

"I love the ironic stupidity of magas. They think Biden has trouble doing anything, yet some how he’s impact gas prices. The reality is that because he’s having trouble doing anything, he actually hasn’t been successful at changing policy and had actually leased out land for oil drilling at a faster rate than frump. 

Biden was even blocked leasing land by a trump appointed judge becuase there were provisions around environmental protection. The intention of the block was to stop Biden from leasing out land so they can say he wouldn’t do it!

"If you crossed the stop line while the light was yellow, you **should** **not** get a ticket (because you didn't violate the law). Whether they actually send you a ticket is another story. If they do, look at the video evidence to see if what you think happened is actually what happened.

While waiting to turn left, you are supposed to move forward into the intersection (as the first car waiting for the left). If you turn at or just after the light change, you are okay. That's what you are supposed to do. However, if you wait at the stop line and then go when the light changes, you have run a red light and will be ticketed if there is a camera.

There have been many proven instances in other parts of the country where yellow light timing is shortened to generate camera ticket income. This has been alledged for some of the cases in Nassau and Suffolk (with strong evidence by some observers). I'm not sure if it has been proven in a court to either have the problem corrected, or as a valid defense to a ticket.

The problem with fighting a camera ticket is that you risk stiffer penalties. The camera ticket only counts against the vehicle because they can't prove who is driving. No points, just a fine. If you go to court and admit you were driving, they can potentially assess points and a higher fine. Either way, you are not going to beat a camera ticket.",t2_16nmpr,jm1161,0,1648146812.0,0,t1_i1yp1ht,i1yp1ht,True,ripped_by_zipcar,t3_tmt30k,https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/tmt30k/outwitted_by_a_yellow_light/,Outwitted by a yellow light,/r/longisland/comments/tmt30k/outwitted_by_a_yellow_light/i1yp1ht/,17,r/longisland,0,17

"Calm down? If I were any calmer my heart would stop beating. If you're projecting, I promise my comment wasn't a personal attack on you. 

The problem with reverse commuting on LIRR is that there is absolutely no value in commuting out of NYC somehow to East Meadow or anywhere else because the job market on the island is terrible, has been terrible for the past few decades, and the expense of commuting to or from NYC is substantial. He would be better off working in NYC in your example. 

My point was and remains that there isn't a lot of wisdom moving TO the island. He'll wind up being another one of these young people suckered into moving here, while so many others in his age group flee the area, only to be hit by the unexpected high cost of living and the realities that have been chasing people in his age group away in increasing numbers over the past 20 years. 

Painting a rosey picture of opportunity or sugarcoating the reality of life here isn't right. It's expensive, there isn't a lot of opportunity, the economy is based on retail jobs and low tier medical care jobs, and the local job market isn't capable of supporting the populating as it is.
