"Gerrymandering has yielded a net advantage for the shrinking Republican party in the last 10 years. Of course Democrats are going to play defense and Republicans are going to be just shocked and appalled that they would ever do such a thing. 

Nevermind that Republicans are currently blocking federal legislation to end partisan redistricting practices, and its ill-gotten supreme court majority has ruled it to be legal.

At least this time around, Democrats won't be the suckers. Maybe Republicans will take redistricting reform a little more seriously which would be a win for democracy, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.",t2_ciu0lkc,rand0muniv3rse,0,1648280503.0,0,t1_i263h6q,i263h6q,False,frogtoadcapital,t3_to7s9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/to7s9w/alaska_supreme_court_finds_anchorage_state_senate/,Alaska Supreme Court finds Anchorage state Senate map is ‚Äòunconstitutional political gerrymander‚Äô,/r/anchorage/comments/to7s9w/alaska_supreme_court_finds_anchorage_state_senate/i263h6q/,1,r/anchorage,0,1

"yeah ive picked up stuff for family in canada and driven stuff down. i used to make the run multiple times a year not so much anymore i havent went through since the pandemic started

i know my dad recently did the trip for one of his buddies who couldnt drive through took a shitty trailer packed full of shit through

if you make a trip of it its really enjoyable. honestly i used to want to move to bc i kinda still do but i havent really looked into it in a while. 

idk ive never really had trouble at the borders some people do i assume theyre a bit tighter now but my dad said they didnt even really look through the trailer. he said he had to stay on the main roads and not go into any towns due to covid and they were pretty strict about how long he would actually be there then he said they either called him or he had to call them while he was in canada and check in. idk if theyre still doing that sort of stuff due to covid or what. 

depending on wherever your crate is you might be able to find someone to grab it for some gas money or something. idk im not going through any time soon though. id love to drive down to washington to see archspire next month but the days of doing that sort of thing whenever i want are few and far between now.",t2_5wt9j,cinaak,0,1648273434.0,0,t1_i25uwy3,i25uwy3,False,Interesting_Title559,t3_to9inn,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/to9inn/has_anyone_shipped_anything_from_canada_to/,Has anyone shipped anything from Canada to Anchorage?

"The Alaska Supreme Court ruled Friday that a map of state Senate districts in Anchorage ‚Äúconstituted an unconstitutional political gerrymander violating equal protection under the Alaska Constitution.‚Äù

In a combined summary decision, the court said it is sending the issue back to a lower court that previously instructed the state‚Äôs five-person redistricting board to redraw the Senate map or explain why it is impossible to do so.

Alaska‚Äôs Senate districts are each made of two House districts. In November, members of the redistricting board linked each of Eagle River‚Äôs House districts with districts elsewhere in Anchorage. This resulted in two Republican-leaning Senate seats and accusations of political gerrymandering by the three Republican-appointed members of the redistricting board.

Some East Anchorage residents sued, challenging the decision and asking for new pairings. The result could be a strongly Republican Eagle River Senate seat and a tossup seat in East Anchorage, but there could also be ripple effects in the Senate districts elsewhere in Anchorage.

The high-court decision upheld all but one part of the redistricting board‚Äôs map of House districts. That lone exception is the ‚ÄúCantwell appendage,‚Äù a peninsula-like arm that places the Interior community of Cantwell into a vast rural House district instead of the Parks Highway district that surrounds it. The court instructed that the peninsula be erased and Cantwell be placed with its neighbors.

The justices overturned a lower-court ruling that found flaws with the boundaries of the state House districts covering Juneau and northern Southeast Alaska.",t2_9xbfyh6m,frogtoadcapital,0,1648252104.0,0,t1_i24rl29,i24rl29,True,frogtoadcapital,t3_to7s9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/to7s9w/alaska_supreme_court_finds_anchorage_state_senate/,Alaska Supreme Court finds Anchorage state Senate map is ‚Äòunconstitutional political gerrymander‚Äô,/r/anchorage/comments/to7s9w/alaska_supreme_court_finds_anchorage_state_senate/i24rl29/,24,r/anchorage,0,24

"Found a triggered liberal. No whoosh here. You just don't agree with me.

I was cautioning OP that this sub will give nothing but liberal responses. That is valid and true. If this sub is *your only basis* on getting opinions on who to vote for, then you have not done proper due diligence. Just like going to ""Save Anchorage"" Facebook page and asking for candidate advice is going to give you very skewed responses. It was a fair warning, because I have seen a lot of people over the years that didn't realize this is primarily a left leaning political sub.

If you don't think this sub is left leaning, then I don't know what to tell ya.

In no way was I assuming OP was going to vote based on opinions here. I was making a blanket statement for anyone reading that this sub will yield liberal responses. So take the advice with a grain of salt. That is why I said ""real answers."" Smart people don't vote based soley on political affiliation.

I share plenty of left views as well as right views. I did not throw any candidate under the bus or advocate for any candidate.

"I'm just getting kinda paranoid now haha, I inherited my moms house when she passed away.

I remember when I was a kid we had mice and they created full on holes like in the back of basement cupboards and my parents never did anything about that. They killed the mice, put traps everywhere for a few months. I was little but I remember them trying really hard to kill mice using glue traps and snap traps and borrowing our aunts cat for awhile. I remember them being very focused on it lol, I became very familiar with mouse traps when I was 6.

I always used to wonder about the little holes left over and think that doesn't seem very good even as a kid. Now I'm like damn it this house is so susceptible and I'm paranoid I have mice.

I have a little mutt that kills shrews in the backyard anytime he hears them, but he's never killed a mouse. When they get on the back porch he goes nuts and seems to hear them right away and runs outside and hunts them down, but I think expecting him to be able to find mice hiding within things in the house is a bit much.

"Thank you for taking this seriously. Because so little is known in the general medical community regarding germline mutations such as Li-Fraumeni, patients often are denied necessary care (i.e. teeth cleaning) or have to constantly advocate for themselves with even their primary care doctors for referrals for MRI's and Ultrasounds vs. X-rays. The guidelines for these patients who undergo numerous yearly scans in order to detect early cancer growth, is always via MRI or Ultrasound. Unfortunately, we have had dentists unwilling to research the issue state: ""Well they'd be covered"". These patients suffer multiple cancers from brain to blood to breast to even their jaws, so unfortunately, there is no amount of covering that will protect them from the radiation, even as little as iodizing dental radiation, which pose a high risk. Those who have been treated for cancer, like the patient I am referring to, are under the care of knowledgeable oncologists who then offer guidance and referrals for specialists.  Our family has suffered greatly due to this genetic mutation, while maneuvering the new world of DNA sequencing that allows us to be informed about our risks.

"Maybe, it would have been a little closer, but from talking to people in the area Grenn wasn't doing any favors for himself.  Grenn barely won the election before that against Liz Vazquez by like 300 votes, Darden was also in that race, as an independent and got almost the exact same amount of votes.

I don't see how you could stop him from running without making the process even more restrictive.  If anything dems should have run any candidate instead of leaving it open for Darden to make a desperate attempt at changing his losing streak.

The state republicans don't want him either, I heard some rumors that people pushed him that direction to distance themselves and poke fun at dems, which seems like it worked.

"I went wide to prevent from splashing a guy on the sidewalk yesterday, but it got me thinking that avoiding being splashed is the pedestrians responsibility.

I Love sending a big wave when I see a big puddle and was spraying the shit out of the sidewalk just a few hundred feet from this guy. But if there was traffic oncoming, he would have been soaked even if I slowed down.

So if you're a pedestrian, you have a personal responsibility to watch for traffic and be aware of puddles to either walk high or stop until there's a gap in traffic.

"Sadly it seems like it's really both google and gci to blame on this. GCI support flat out said unless we sell the phone we won't spend our time working to get the specific carrier settings to that phone maker to have it included in their builds. 

I have a large problem with that as they advertise that we can bring and use our own unlocked phones on the network. Heck they even have a support page for the pixels on their site, but it doesn't change that it doesn't allow access for 5g (though the bands are on the phone) and no wifi calling or VoLTE. The other downside is the carrier settings also include the ability to access the T-Mobile 5g network in the lower 48. I placed a T-Mobile SIM in from a family member and immediately had all the 5g, VoLTE, wifi calling options.

"The following post is from Dan @ Google Community Forum

That is very interesting, especially since it was 2 phones and 2 replacement phones with the exact same issue says either a carrier issue or the phone has compatibility issues with the carrier. I run off Tmobile in a different state and have no issue getting 5g and 5G UC (midband/mmwave).   
  
I am not too familair with GCI but looking at the coverage map I see 5g in the downtown area of Anchorage as well as coastal areas in the direction of Whittier as well as going north in the direction of Palmer.   
  
Also, this might recommended but it looks like there are people having VoLTE issues with Pixel 6 Pro and GCI (understood it is not 5G connection issue but might be related). In short, in order to get VoLTE to work they had to call customer support and get the phones IMEI manually added to their IMS network to add compatibility. This also fixes wifi calling on the network. Unknown if it fixes 5G.   
  
I also see GCI uses a mix of 5G frequencies  mainly in the 600, 700, and 850 MHz range. The pixel supports n71 (600mhz) n258 (26GHz), n260 (39 GHz) n262 (47GHz). The Pixel 6 Pro supports n71, n258 and n260. n71 is great for wide coverage so there should be no issue.   
  
I see a thread in Reddit dedicated to the issue that might be worth checking out. The general consensus is GCI and the Pixel 6 Pro are currently not set up to work",t2_92d33e6i,Open-Island7131,0,1648008632.0,0,t1_i1r7i3w,i1r7i3w,True,akvw,t3_qpjs1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/qpjs1h/random_gci_user_question/,Random GCI user question,/r/anchorage/comments/qpjs1h/random_gci_user_question/i1r7i3w/,1,r/anchorage,0,1
"Purchased two 6 Pro's, unlocked, in December 2021. I live in Anchorage, Alaska. (yes this is part of the USA). Local provider is General Communications Inc. (GCI). GCI is owned by Liberty Broadband and they also partner with T Mobile.  I get no 5g service anywhere. I went through all the touble shooting steps with tech support for weeks. Then they decided the phones were defective and sent me 2 'refurbished' phones. This fixed nothing! Then Google blamed the carrier, I called the carrier they blamed Google, for not allowing their phones to function on their network. I traveled to Oregon, Flordia, and California in Feburary 2022 connecting to T-Mobile directly, never once got a 5g connection. I tried to return the phones but now I'm beyond the return window.

Having lived in shitty neighborhoods, and anyone that has had the same experience will say that rich folks harping on single instance of crime is nothing compared to the everyday experiences many people face, in less affluent areas.

But then it was explained to me how we all benefit from strong public schools. Supporting public schools helps the community. You want lower crime rates? Get kids involved in school activities. Make schools available, safe, and welcoming. Higher levels of education also keeps adults in the community. Most people that you want to stay in your community will move their families elsewhere if the schools aren't good.

"My senior year and the summer after I graduated from high school in Bethel I had 3 pretty fun jobs.

I was a volunteer firefighter during my senior year in high school. It was pretty cool having my beeper go off in the middle of class and getting to run out to go to a fire. Saw 5 burnt dead people that year.

&#x200B;

I also worked part time at KYUK as a production assistant and on-air DJ. 

That year they let me and friends have 2 weekly late night shows where we could do pretty much anything we wanted. 

We had the Thirsty Thursday Show with some older friends and the Show At 8 on Friday with my school buddies. 

We had so much fun getting 3 hours 2 times a week to just talk about whatever we wanted. Because it was 10pm to 1am we got to play songs with swear words and talk about more adult things.

&#x200B;

Then the job I got over the summer was the graveyard shift bethel dock security. I got to drive around in the truck they gave me all night, hanging out with friends and fucking off. 

The best part was when a boat full of wasted people would come in from the river and I would have to try and see if they had registration for their boat and if not try to sell them one. 

It was always a toss up between a boat full of drunk people yelling at me, telling me to fuck off and sometimes even threating me with guns. 

Or they would offer me booze and drugs to just let them pass. One time the people in the boat were to drunk to drive home so I gave them a ride home and the guy in the cabin with me gave me the little amount of coke they had left. I didn't do drugs back then so I though it away.

&#x200B;

That was a fun year. I'm glad I got to grow up in Bethel and miss it sometimes. But now as an adult I don't even want to visit my family there for more then a day haha. 

I'm a city boy now and I work in tv news here in Anchorage and that's pretty fun too.",t2_1ftiodsz,KylePBurke,0,1647916907.0,0,t1_i1m5alr,i1m5alr,True,No-Text8820,t3_tj824o,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/tj824o/best_job_in_alaska/,Best job in Alaska?,/r/anchorage/comments/tj824o/best_job_in_alaska/i1m5alr/,2,r/anchorage,0,2

"> stigmatizing the poorer side of town.

seriously? your neighbors car was stolen, and that somehow negates crime maps? And, people's experiences in those neighborhoods? 

Hill Side is the same as Fairview? Mt. View? Parts of Muldoon? Other pockets?

You poor, poor soul dealing with all the crime, and gunshots, and vagrants with all the other people suffering from mass crime on hillside. The rest of us feel your pain. Must be getting rough up there for you. 


You're much less likely to hear gunshots in certain parts of town than others. There is a lot of crime here. To pretend it is not more prevalent in some areas/ neighborhoods isn't woke, or doing a service to anyone. It's ignoring reality.

 And, when you decided to throw your privilege into the conversation, about your neighbor having their car stolen in a ""safe"" neighborhood, and pretend that overall you're less likely to encounter violent crime on daily basis, it really just draws attention away from the real conversation, of the access to a *safer* neighborhood for people in places that don't have the luxury, and privilege of living on Hillside. 

Anyone living in a shitty neighborhood in this town would happily trade places with you.

That's a fact. That's why we have varying property values. It's why people fight to live in different neighborhoods. it's a fact of life.

"If you live in the area, you should come down by the railyard on a Sunday and see how it all goes. The barge is in, the train gets loaded, the tanks get filled, the trucks go back and forth like crazy. It's fascinating to see how Alaskans get 90% of their stuff.

And, come down during summer and see all the tourist activity ($$$). I'm always super nice to them, give them directions and suggestions, etc. I will never remember them, but they will remember me, and how Alaskans are super friendly, and spend more of their money before leaving...and tell their friends to spend money here, too! They're our only renewable resource. Annoying but a good cash cow.
