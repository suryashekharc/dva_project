"My guess is that city council could care less about the number of metro transit police they have, especially with a huge portion of downtown being empty space. To be honest, as much as people enjoy grouping MPD and SPPD together, the SPPD has been historically good, in a historically safe city. The only reason Carter is now bragging about “the largest police academy in city history” is because the city elected to NOT have one in 2020 due to…Covid? Shitty excuse.

"FYI HOMEOWNERS

Contrary to what the article states, **there is no need to call the city about this.** Sign up for updates here: https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/saint-paul-regional-water-services

I called the number in the article.  Basically: 

- there is no first-come first-served policy.  
- There is nothing to sign up for.
- The city will be rolling this out street by street
- they will make contact when it is your turn.  
- 1 inch copper will replace your lead service


priority will be by street needing repair. If you live on a newer street, you are likely to wait longer for new service line than someone on a street needing repaving.  This is because they will need to rip up your street, to get at your connection, and it makes sense to do this for an entire street for efficiency.

"You're right, most developers don't pursue projects that are 100% affordable, but almost all are willing to build some affordable units if they can increase the rent on other units (see: Minneapolis.) This amendment restricts the ability of developers to cap some of their unitsand still make the returns that their financiers expect.

Further, *high-income units reduce the price of all units*. It's called the filtering effect. Each high-rent unit you build increases the supply of high-rent units, which in turn reduces the price of high-rent units in real terms. This allows a middle-income family to move into a now-cheaper high-rent unit and frees up a middle-income unit. The increased supply of middle-income units reduces the price of middle-income units, which in turn makes it possible for a low-income household to move into a middle-income unit. This frees up a low-income unit, increasing the supply of low-income units, and reducing their price in turn.

It's a complicated effect, but the net result is that one new high-income unit actually ""adds"" a low-income unit. Thus, you want developers to build *no matter what income* they expect will fill the units. This rent control amendment, by restricting all rents, is actually going to hurt low-income people as well as high-income people.",t2_3tn6uqi5,jcmcgough,0,1647887656.0,0,t1_i1k973w,i1k973w,False,dmau9600,t3_tgbbuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/tgbbuq/minnesota_senate_committee_votes_to_cancel_rent/,"Minnesota Senate committee votes to cancel rent control ordinances in Minneapolis, St. Paul",/r/saintpaul/comments/tgbbuq/minnesota_senate_committee_votes_to_cancel_rent/i1k973w/,1,r/saintpaul,0,1
"Yeah but here's the thing: If the value of an investment is capped below market value *developers just won't make the investment*.

Let's say you have five dollars. You can invest it in a low-return market (St. Paul) and make six dollars, or invest it in a higher return market nearby (say, Falcon Heights) and make ten dollars. You want to make ten dollars more than you want to make six, so you'll invest your money in Falcon Heights. *You won't make the investment in St. Paul*. 

Limited capital + seeking highest returns possible = avoiding low-return investments.

And let's be clear: this isn't just a ""wah wah"" for developers. This will materially harm metro residents by raising rents over time.

Your wage doesn't grow enough every year, and that's a problem, but it's a separate problem. The solution to stagnant wages is not to cap the price of everything a low-wage person might want to buy, but to raise your wage. Rent control is a solution to some problems, but not a solution to stagnant wages.",t2_3tn6uqi5,jcmcgough,0,1647887174.0,0,t1_i1k7yra,i1k7yra,False,dmau9600,t3_tgbbuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/tgbbuq/minnesota_senate_committee_votes_to_cancel_rent/,"Minnesota Senate committee votes to cancel rent control ordinances in Minneapolis, St. Paul",/r/saintpaul/comments/tgbbuq/minnesota_senate_committee_votes_to_cancel_rent/i1k7yra/,1,r/saintpaul,0,1

"I wish I understood the monetary side of this decision. Everyone seems to praise their beers, so why shut down if it's popular? 

Could they not find a buyer and sell the company?

What about renting space to other brewers? I thought that was a popular thing these days, but maybe not.

Maybe they've tried all this and more, obviously I wouldn't know. I'm not an expert on any of this but it just makes me curious about how one comes to this decision.

"**[Wheatstone bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge)** 
 
 >A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. The primary benefit of the circuit is its ability to provide extremely accurate measurements (in contrast with something like a simple voltage divider). Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer. The Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie (sometimes spelled ""Christy"") in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843.

And it's honestly, because they are uncomfortable dealing with the fact that this is a major problem, and they've been taught to simply sweep issues like this under the rug, because again, of the non-confrontational nature of the state.

There is a major problem with dealing with outsiders in the state, or people who are perceived to be outsiders, and instead of talking about it, we're finding solutions with, people get upset with you for bringing it up.   It's like we didn't learn about the lessons from 2 years ago.   

And it's interesting you brought up the whole went to the same high school thing as everyone. If you knew the nature of redlining in this state, it isn't by accident that you weren't exposed the same people in high school.

"I think 3% is reasonable for old construction, but most will agree that 3% is way, *way* too low for new construction.

Landlords, as economic actors, are theoretically willing to engage in any endeavor that makes a profit, and 3% per year is generally plenty to do that. The problem is that landlords are, in reality, not actually willing to ""provide housing"" (i.e., rent out properties they own rather than sell them) for 3% a year because they can get easily get twice or three times as much in unregulated communities. It's not about whether or not landlords *should* make more than 3%, it's about whether or not they're *willing* to work for that, and most are not. Landlords can make money at 3%, but most won't bother.

The same problem extends to financiers and developers. The value of a new apartment complex is the total expected value of the rents it will accrue *ad infinitum*. Subtracting inflation from the rent cap, that means that most developments in Saint Paul will only be able to make 1% annually on new construction, and when immediately across the border in Minneapolis, they could get 5%+, they just won't finance new construction. They have limited capital, and they, on average, won't dump it into a less profitable project when they could spend it on a more expensive one.

At this point, the analysis is pretty straightforward: at 3%, existing landlords will take their properties out of the rental market if they can, and developers and financiers won't finance new construction. This will drastically reduce the supply of rentable units over time and actually *increase* rents across the region. Saint Paul's 3% rent cap, then, will exclude low-income residents from the region by reducing the supply of rentable units, even if a small subset of them remain rent-controlled.

This isn't to say that rent control is always the wrong policy; applied surgically, carefully, and prudently, rent control can save a lot of heartache for communities, and that's worth something. Ultimately, though, the long-term, collective impact of a blanket rent control policy like Saint Paul's will be negative.

In my opinion, the better solution than rent control is just to unleash housing supply by deregulating the market (the urbanist perspective, and one Minneapolis has embraced.)

"I see it both ways, honestly. I think there should be affordable options for people, and that does start with adding MORE options. That said, land developers and landlords typically don’t run non-profits, and won’t build in an area where they can’t make money. So without companies building, you won’t have additional spaces for people. 

While I agree, we should have affordable housing, I think the rent control measures went a little too far. Capping increases to 3% a year is problematic once you take into account interest rates, utility increases and taxes. Essentially, unless you price your rental correctly to account for future cost increases, you will eventually lose money. (I know, boo hoo)

Additionally, even if the unit is NOT rented and is sitting vacant, you are still not allowed to increase the rental price by more than 3% a year. So, basically landlords will have to overprice their rental units ahead of time to account for future increases, which will just raise all rents in the area.

With all of that said, I do agree that we need to do something to protect lower income people from being priced out of their own neighborhood. I rented an apartment and I remember having to move because the rent went up $200 a month. 

I think the most realistic way to approach this issue is to tie the increases to a moving target, like say interest rates or tax increases percentage than just coming up with an arbitrary number. Either that or incentivize rental businesses to rent to lower income families by giving them tax breaks/refunds.

"I moved to St Paul in 1970. Many of the descriptions given on this subject sound like it’s 1970. Again. This past summer in what people here would describe as a nice neighborhood I woke up to the sound of my dog telling me something was in the back yard. I didn’t think much of it. It was still dark. Maybe a rabbit. Found out later that  the St. Paul Police were in my back yard with a Police Dog looking for a young man who a hour before had stolen a car 2 blocks from my nice neighborhood home and then struck and murdered a 50 year old neighbor out for his normal early morning walk. 
The police were nice enough to leave the gate to my yard open so my dog could get loose as I let her out later that morning. As they searched every yard on my block they left every gate open. 
I have never heard that they caught the nice young man who murdered my neighbor. 
I was just grateful that I didn’t let my dog out while police with a dog in the dark were in my back yard without knocking on my door to alert me. My dog would have not fared well in her yard with that encounter. 
Last year we had record area murder numbers. After a cold winter we are on par to set a new record this year.

St. Paul has lots of great neighborhoods and I don’t think Cleveland is a fair comparison. I’d say people save money by moving to the burbs. Or they at least get more land and house for the same amount of money. That is unless you buy a house in a questionable neighborhood. We rent an apartment in St. Paul and we pay for the location. We could get much more apartment for the same amount of money If we were in the suburbs.,t2_np5xyyn,purplepe0pleeater,0,1647450195.0,0,t1_i0wmjbz,i0wmjbz,True,Sonicdonkey466,t3_tfh1o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/tfh1o8/is_living_in_st_paul_proper_a_bad_idea/,Is living in St. Paul proper a bad idea?,/r/saintpaul/comments/tfh1o8/is_living_in_st_paul_proper_a_bad_idea/i0wmjbz/,12,r/saintpaul,0,12

"There are frequent posts on this subreddit and other local ones asking if St. Paul or Minneapolis are safe. I'm never sure what exactly is being asked. Do you mean personal safety? Are you asking about property crime? Is it about perception of risk or actual risk (the former is personal and depends on a number of factors, the latter is just data). I'm a 6'4"" straight, white man, so I  don't feel unsafe as much as many other people might, for example, if you are a woman or identify as queer or trans. Crime is also not evenly spread across a population or geographic area. It can be concentrated in very specific areas (like a particular bar) or limited to parties that already know each other. 

As another poster commented, some neighborhoods can vary block to block. One block might have a problem corner bar or a single house that attracts problems. I've lived in St. Paul (Hamline-Midway) for seven years and love it. Walkable, easy access to pretty much anything you could need, easy to get to both city centers, great transit with the Green Line and A-Line, etc. It's a vibrant neighborhood with lots of families and lots of upside.",t2_4gq9tvpb,jdrmsp,0,1647439047.0,0,t1_i0vveyz,i0vveyz,True,Sonicdonkey466,t3_tfh1o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/tfh1o8/is_living_in_st_paul_proper_a_bad_idea/,Is living in St. Paul proper a bad idea?,/r/saintpaul/comments/tfh1o8/is_living_in_st_paul_proper_a_bad_idea/i0vveyz/,46,r/saintpaul,0,46
"I've lived within a mile of downtown for 20 years now. No issues. No burglaries, nothing stolen from my yard, no vandalism, no threats, and the only ""is that gunfire?"" comes from the kiddies on the neighborhood Facebook and Nextdoor pages. That's not a universal experience; I had a neighbor many people didn't like and he had some stuff stolen from his yard and some loud arguments outside his place. But it's been pretty quiet here. 

I would argue, though, that living within city limits is cheaper than the burbs. Despite what the people in the burbs like to think, enough people want to live in St. Paul that housing prices have gone way up in certain neighborhoods. Actually, they've gone up in *all* neighborhoods and while there are parts of some neighborhoods you probably won't feel safe in, get a few blocks away in the same neighborhood and the streets get much quieter.

Living in the city you probably won't spend buckets of money feeding and caring for a car because you have to drive everywhere you want to go in the suburbs. I can walk to a decent grocery store and restaurants/bars and liquor, the library, and a rec center, and bike to more groceries, a drug store, more restaurants/bars and another rec center. Multiple bus lines, too. 

So do the math. Find out what houses you might like will cost and then look at the property taxes for that house. It may be cheaper than the suburbs and paying 59 cents a mile for fuel and wear and tear on a car.

"Dark Horse Eatery just reopened after their winter hiatus, glad to have them back to the lowertown area! 

The old bedlam/Hygga/elephant bar space off of 4th street is being revamped again to a restaurant called Lost Fox that seems like a good fit. Reading about it, it sounds like it’s going to be a coffee bar/shop that will turn into more of a restaurant style format later in the day/weekends. Not a ton of all-day options in lowertown, so that prospect seems exciting. There is also a new brewery and resturaunt in the markethouse building, but i have not been there just yet. 

Other than that, I’m excited for the possibility of the return of food trucks to Mears park over the summer.

"Ultimately it is the responsibility of the property owner to clear snow on the PUBLIC walkway/sidewalk. It is also the property owner’s responsibility to clear snow on the access walkways and stairs on the property for you.

You will have to bug the landlord about clearing snow on the stairs/walkway to your unit. Good luck with that. If I were you I would offer to shovel for the property in exchange for a break on rent and get that in writing or at least an email vs a verbal agreement. I used to do my own repairs on my unit and send my landlord a bill for parts and labor (a modest $20/hr) with pics - this was greatly appreciated because it’s a lot more convenient for us both this was than if I called him, he called the guy, waiting, etc.

The PUBLIC walkway is another story - you can file a formal complaint the city (YOU SHOULD DO THIS) and the property owner will get a letter warning them to shovel and explain the consequences if they don’t (city will clear the snow and owner will get a fat bill from the city) In St. Paul it is easy to file a complaint online.

And it is important to us, we walk our dog in this neighborhood too, I hate the ice just like the guy in the article.

"I bought in City Walk 2.5 years ago and am glad I did. The building is exceptionally quiet and very well maintained. Internet is not part of the HOA dues but you can have good options. Obviously Comcast, but I recently dropped them for Verizon 5G Home and it has been a HUGE change for the better. The building amenities are due for some updating but the board is good about managing the funds to not over extend on projects. The pool and deck are quite nice and get a ton of use in warmer months but are never “busy.” I like that are HOA dues are comparatively lower than other buildings in the area.  

Mears Park is skyway accessible as is the rest of downtown/lowertown. You’re also a 5-minute walk to Lunds, the only grocery store in the entirety of downtown. For restaurants there’s Black Sheep/Keys/Sawatdee/Camp and Tin Whiskers close by and a host of others toward the xcel.

Overall I’m super happy here and wouldn’t want to live anywhere else.

"I lived in Saint Paul my whole life 40 now. There is bad areas I suggest not to go too at night. East Saint Paul (biggest area) is geto. Lower east side is the worst.

Consider a cake doughnut. It’s wheel-shaped, laden with sugar or glaze and dense — at times, a little too heavy for my liking. Now, take that regular cake doughnut and add some bounce and levity to the dough (in the form of glutinous rice flour) and a bulbous shape (think eight small spheres of dough connected to form a ring). And there you have it: a mochi doughnut.

Mochi doughnuts have become trendy among U.S. foodies in the past two years, and they have finally arrived in Minnesota by way of Soga Mochi Donut, the new doughnut kiosk in St. Paul’s Dragon Star Oriental Foods.

Soga’s co-founder, Bella Zhan, originally fell in love with these doughnuts when she was studying and living in Japan. In Tokyo, there’s a beloved doughnut chain called Mister Donut, which popularized the mochi doughnut (also known as the pon de ring doughnut). Every day, Zhan would traverse back from school and pick up a Mister Donut mochi doughnut along the way. Mochi doughnuts are sold in Hawaii, California and New York, but, when Zhan was doing research, there were none in Minnesota. “When I came back to the U.S., I really missed that texture, that taste of the doughnut. So that’s when I started to create a plan to open a mochi doughnut shop,” Zhan said.

Soga Mochi Donut offers mainstay mochi doughnut flavors that include an original mochi doughnut and a churro mochi doughnut, along with four flavors of the week that change each Monday — some past flavors include matcha doughnuts made with ceremonial grade matcha powder from Japan, Oreo, pistachio and yuzu. Zhan seeks inspiration for the weekly flavors by perusing the ice cream section of Target and compiling a list of different flavor possibilities on her Notes app.

These scratch-made doughnuts incorporate glutinous rice flour into the batter to create a chewy, elastic texture. This flour is naturally higher in starch, which lends a bouncier mouthfeel to the treat. The doughnuts come out hot with a golden and crisp exterior, and they go down bite by bite, chewy and light. According to Zhan, on any given weekend day, the shop sells around 1,800 to 2,000 doughnuts.

Though Zhan’s mochi doughnut shop is Minnesota’s first, it won’t be Minnesota’s last. The soon-to-open Bober Tea and Mochi Dough in Dinkytown is slated to open sometime this spring. Who knows where else folks will find these doughnut delights in Minnesota in the coming months? But for now, Zhan is elated to introduce Minnesotans to the magic of the mochi doughnut.

"The Rayette has gorgeous units, but if you happen to face west or north (I was on the 4th floor facing west) you got little to no sun - the Cosmo blocks it out for the most part.

I found the best place to take my little Parti-Yorkie for some exercise is the field behind Liquor Vault, there is almost never other dogs there and it's a huge area for her to run around, on her extended leash of course.

I’m obviously a homer with this project but here’s something for people that don’t see the value. No matter if the line is initially popular, or if the passenger train gets canceled in 5 years, the double trackage, the upgraded rail and speed, the updated rail crossing will all still be an asset for the state. Freight railroads (the BNSF) would be able to run 80 mph freight trains (110 rating for passenger usually isn’t what freight is rated for) with huge sidings  will allow for more freight traffic.

">I’m really into a train between Duluth and Twin Cities but would it actually be longer than bus? I’ve taken the bus and it certainly doesn’t reach 90 mph. Is this just due to freight sidings? Does this require a full stop? Also what would be needed as far as rail infrastructure and tech to bump the speed up a bit?

I used to work in the rail industry and I 100% believe it, because, as you mentioned, all the sidings required for trains to pass each other. BNSF will probably always de-prioritize passenger trains as well, so you'll be taking the siding pretty much 100% of the time there's any conflict.

Turnouts themselves on sidings require certain speed limits according to their geometry and just... physics (or you'll derail), so the slow down is pretty much inevitable.

The way to make it more efficient is to study frequent points of conflict, then just put in dual-track for those areas.

But then they kept adding stops, so it just become a big bus stopping all the time. 

Originally the revitalization of union depot was to meet bigger trains going to Duluth, south, and eau Claire. 

Going to union depot in Saint Paul still makes good sense provided they make a good connection to the airport, and remove a couple stops from the green line. 

Personally I don’t know who’d ride it, other than people going to the airport from Duluth, or old people visiting their adult children.

*“I don’t see why people would use it,” said state Sen. Jason Rarick, R-Pine City. “It’s going to take longer than a bus or any other transportation, and I don’t see that the cost is going to be worth the usage.”*

I’m really into a train between Duluth and Twin Cities but would it actually be longer than bus? I’ve taken the bus and it certainly doesn’t reach 90 mph. Is this just due to freight sidings? Does this require a full stop? Also what would be needed as far as rail infrastructure and tech to bump the speed up a bit?

*“BNSF has not signed off and won’t, organizers say, until the project is fully funded.”*

Seems to be the biggest obstacle in rail services these days. I wonder if they’d pull some fuckery like they did with the light rail trying to juice it for every dime. 

*“…I see the ridership will be, is just not going to be worth it,” Rarick said”*

If it’s not an option for people of course the projected ridership numbers will be low. If you build it they will come. 

All in all I really want this to happen.

"I’ve been in the area since about 2015. It’s definitely a bit quieter now than it has been pre-pandemic, but it does have its more active moments. Saturdays with the farmers market, Saints games, and the Saint Paul art crawl make the area of a busier, and fun to be in the warmer months. The winter months are definitely a bit quiet, not much happens here beyond the winter carnival parade in January.

The light rail transit station is pretty active, and it does have some houseless folk that are there. However, that station is under constant watch by metro transit police. Even late at night and early in the morning there are officers there. I do frequent the light rail pretty often, and I do have the safe line number for metro transit saved to my phone to reach out in a bad situation. 

My best piece of advice is, if financially possible, support the local restaurants in the area as often as you can. Lowertown has had a string of restaurants come and go in the six years I’ve been here. A lot of restaurants that open up here, even now, depend on local traffic beyond a lot of the events in order to stay active.

"Lived at The Cosmopolitan from June 2019 to June 2021. The area is nice, especially with the transit access. I have Wolves season tickets and would regularly take the train from Union Depot to Target Center (sometimes the 94 depending on the time). The Union Depot station is fairly safe, that might be since there are always transit police there although I kind of question how effective they truly are. Even though I own a car, I really like using public transit, especially if I'm going somewhere with expensive parking (an added plus is that I can booze it up). The various farmer's markets are also nice. The big one is obviously near the Saints Stadium, but during the weekdays there are also some near the Palace Theatre that often are cheaper.  
  
The main reason that I moved to Lowertown was since I worked in downtown Saint Paul and could walk to work. I spent a lot of time in  the skyway as a kid since my mom worked at Ecolab, so there are also good memories for me. There certainly are a lot more homeless people now, but that is sort of to be expected with so many people being ruined financially by the pandemic as well as the city's policy on treating homelessness like whack-a-mole.",t2_6wgzl,nrag726,0,1646853921.0,0,t1_i00ctrl,i00ctrl,True,sabbyteur,t3_taem7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/taem7a/if_you_live_in_lowertown_how_is_it_doing_since/,"If you live in Lowertown, how is it doing since the start of the pandemic?

"I’m not a Lowertown resident. However I live less than 10 minutes from dt St. Paul, work in dt St. Paul and have friends that live in Lowertown so I frequently use transit to get to and from Lowertown. 

Overall transit still is lagging behind the pre-pandemic riders at least from my experiences. My bus in the morning/evening are usually very quiet. Union Depot station is more of the same. Every time I’ve used it I’ve been maybe one of a handful of people there.

"The city of St. Paul is dogged by having a high percentage of nonprofit properties belonging to government, schools, churches, hospitals, etc. that does not pay property taxes or the right of way fees us ordinary residents and business owners pay and yet those roads still need plowing, pothole filling, etc. There's a lot less money floating around the city for maintenance.

I think the workers on the street are just as good at their jobs as anyone anywhere but they've gotten the message for years that the department is a political reward, the people in charge often don't have any idea how to do what needs to be done, and that doing the job well has no real reward. I have had a couple of conversations with the new leader and I think they get it to a much greater degree than leaders have for many years.

But in our last 4 years there, we lived with: a drug house that took over a year to evict, needles on the street, finding casings in the street, a car jacking that crashed two houses away, two side swipes of our parked car, a car break in, and calling in close gunshots at least once per week.

Just gotta stay diligent. And don't give up on what you want in a house, if you have the time. Better to wait longer and get more of what you want.

What finally broke the ice for me was two things:
1. Guaranteeing the appraisal. If you can, this is really attractive to sellers. It might eat into your down payment plans, but if you can afford it, it's a good tool. 
2. Skipped the inspection. Two big caveats: the sellers had a thorough pre-inspection done and I have a fair amount of handyman experience.

"TLDR; Be aggressive, B-E AGGRESSIVE.

Well, I'd sell you my house for $350k if you have $100k of it in cash. Otherwise I can only offer my personal experience. 

We bought in the fall of 2020. We only looked at 3-4 houses in person. We looked online at a lot of overpriced, tiny, shit houses just flying off the market. I realized pretty quick that if we found something we really liked, we better go all in. 

I can't remember how I figured this out, maybe our agent told us, but new listings get posted online at like midnight or a few hours there after, evidently. 

So I can't sleep, cause I'm stressing about life and finding a house and how crazy the market is. It's like 1am and I'm hitting refresh repeatedly, even though nothing really changes... Then, boom. There it was. It had literally everything we wanted and WAY more. Okay, we woulda liked an extra shitter, but literally this house is so perfect for us. It was also within our budget, so we had room to move.

So I started calling right then and there. I left voicemails for agents at two, three in the morning. You gotta be first. You gotta stand out. You gotta be prompt. I kid you not, I fell asleep with my phone on my chest so wouldn't miss when my agent called. After all, I only got a couple hours of sleep that night. 

Agent calls, we get first look, 10am that day. I was fortunate enough at the time to be making my own work schedule, so I was ready to go asap. I know, there's a lot of privilege in that though, not everyone can do that. 

We offered by noon that day, before anyone else had even seen the house. Seriously. My husband hadn't even seen the house. He's a good dude. Our first offer was already more than asking. 

I think we waited a couple days for them to gather a few more offers. In that time we began talking to our agent about preparing a second offer already. We talked about what our absolute best and final offer would be. It wasn't a home run by any means, but it aggressive I guess.

We had everything ready to go as soon as the sellers requested it, almost immediately. Everything they asked of us we had back to them in a matter of minutes. 

We beat a cash offer. We were told it was very close to ours, but our promptness to everything was the reason they chose us. It was the only house we put a serious offer on (we offered less than asking on a house that WREAKED of pet urine, their agent told us they expected to sell for well over asking, lol). 

3br plus an office, patio room, mudroom and a partially finished basement. Siding, furnace and central air are all only a couple years old. Two car garage, big fenced in yard for the dog and gardening. We basically only have a neighbor on one side of the property, that's really awesome too. Huge kitchen with fresh, decent quality cabinets. We LOVE our windows, also just a couple years old, they're so quiet, and that matters where we live, haha. And it wasn't a cheap flip. We were adimit about that from the start. All the appliances and upgrades were done at a reasonable price, not cheap and slap-dicked together like so many houses on the market.",t2_78oel,kGibbs,1,1646356757.0,0,t1_hz9csn1,hz9csn1,True,noodlebowl1,t3_t60quw,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/t60quw/someone_want_to_sell_me_your_house/,Someone want to sell me your house?,/r/saintpaul/comments/t60quw/someone_want_to_sell_me_your_house/hz9csn1/,0,r/saintpaul,0,0

"That's great to hear.

Is it possible to get most of what you want in a slightly lower price bracket so you have room to play with? You can also lower your percentage down on the contract (though don't go lower than 10 percent if you can avoid it) and apply the difference to an appraisal gap. For example, if you were going to put $60,000 down and that was 20 percent, consider putting 10%/$30,000 down on the PA and tell the sellers you'll contribute up to an additional $10,000 or $15,000 or whatever you're comfortable with toward a short appraisal (I know the numbers don't add up to $60,000, but 15% down is a weird number). If that coverage isn't needed, you can still close with 20% down but you at least have the cash free if you need it. You can always put more down at close than you put on the purchase agreement but not less (without revising).",t2_q63w4,bryaninmsp,0,1646350002.0,0,t1_hz8xu5e,hz8xu5e,False,noodlebowl1,t3_t60quw,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/t60quw/someone_want_to_sell_me_your_house/,Someone want to sell me your house?,/r/saintpaul/comments/t60quw/someone_want_to_sell_me_your_house/hz8xu5e/,4,r/saintpaul,0,4

"Hey these are all very good points. Hopefully the people in charge of these situations, who are for sure not me lol, do the same. The cost/benefit analysis is fine, but I’d also like to see us in general also consider the cost of upkeep too. 

Like you said police reform is an urgent need but what I think some people don’t think of is how much is it costing us right now to not address the issue. That’s a number I don’t know, I don’t know if anyone knows. But there is a cost there, and ignoring it may be easy, but it also might be harmful in ways we don’t expect.

"I don't think you're ""full of it"", of course not.  But I do believe that your idea is just like all others: competing in a marketplace of ideas. 

Some have currency (police reform is an easy example), and urgency behind them.  And if they're politically-expedient, then they are all the more likely to have the support needed. 

This idea could be a good one, but it's expensive, and would come at a cost to many families, businesses, hospitals, etc, who have set up for decades to be near a interstate corridor. 

In a vacuum, it's great.  But the implications to hundreds of thousands of people MUST BE justified by something bigger.  It's a cost-benefit analysis.   Everyone can see the cost... so put the benefit on the other side of the scale.

"More housing would hopefully solve some of these issues you bring up. Of course I’m no expert, but I’d say cheaper housing/available housing and hopefully more affordable housing can solve some of these issues. 

I don’t know about you, but the lack of people in certain neighborhoods seems like a recipe for crime. With streets deserted crime doesn’t have to hide in the shadows. We have so much infrastructure that’s already created and such low density in certain areas, downtown is a ghost town at certain times. Instead of making cops cover super sparse areas, it would be nicer if those police assets could be used to cover more people is smaller areas. Again I’m no expert.

The way it is now with 94 is that it’s a scare through a neighborhood, a recurring bill that the state’s tax payers have to pay (not just metro citizens) and no taxable assets minus the gas taxes in your tank are producing revenue for the city. Homes, businesses produce revenue for the city. However that revenue also means a bigger bill for services which we will need to see before any conclusion could be made. 

The way it is now, I haven’t seen a city for awhile that can do even some of the most basic tasks it needs to do. Like keep sidewalks clean of litter and dog waste, provide good policing, and give citizens a reason to be proud. As a Saint Paul resident I am proud of the potential the city has, it’s transformed a lot in the past 100 years, I’m hoping that we can sew some seeds for the next 100 years. Erasing 94 I believe would fix some of the above points I’ve pointed out. It might be inconvenient for commuters in the short term, but could be beneficial in the long run. 

Thank you for replying in a constructive way. I’m no expert, I like the idea, but I know it isn’t perfect. I just want to talk to my neighbors and hear what they think. I’d welcome any more ideas you have, if you think I’m full of it, that is fine.

"Seems to me that any plan to eliminate a highway absolutely must to be preceded by, or in conjunction with, greatly expanded public transport.  It also can't just be more busses.  We need more light rail.

If they put a light rail down the middle of a new avenue and greatly expand park and ride lots at key places around the city that could go a long way to helping, but the whole city still needs a lot of change with public transport first.

I drive 12-20 minutes to work every day depending on traffic.  If I wanted to take public transport I would need to walk for 15-20 minutes, and then ride a bus for 1-1.5 hours.  I could bike, but even that is 45-50 minutes and isn't a great option in the winter, also it involves a lot of street riding instead of dedicated paths.  

The US as a whole is in desperate need of a better vision of traffic for the future.  And 10-30 years down the line if by some miracle we are able to realize that vision then I would be thrilled if they started tearing down highways that become unneeded.  In the meantime it is one of the most important stretches of highway in the fucking state, and removing it would be exceedingly moronic.

"Woof. Not much to say if you’re only willing to view the world through one lens.

As to disgust and vitriol being useful tools? What the hell are you reading? Everything I’ve ever read points to disgust as a key characteristic of closed-mindedness, suffering and polarization.

On a personal level, disgust inhibits change/transformation. A core realization of 20th century psychology was that a positive therapeutic relationship (call it “unconditional positive regard” or “compassion” or whatever you want) is the single most important factor in behavior change.

I suggest you try some Fromm or Rogers or Frankl - all theorists whose work was directly inspired by their experiences of fascism in the mid-20th century.

And as to your points about the articles:
1) yes, as I originally stated, saying people are leaving is not denying that people are also arriving. The TC market is up and also data shows folks left at a higher rate early in the pandemic. They’re not mutually exclusive. Again, my whole point. 

2) Jay Caspian King is a strong liberal who cites valid sources. Sorry you’re not familiar. 

3) Again, that figure and article proves my point that the story is more multidimensional than the partisan binary fight you seem to be personally engaged in.

"I love the idea of Mears Park and Rice Park 

But the execution is just so stupid IMO

Mears is just far too hilly to be used for anything other than sitting. This park should have been far more flat and maybe even been 2-3x bigger.

Rice got way too much concrete in the most recent face lift. It’s far more patio/walking path than grass at this point. 

Maybe with the tree removal, a wholesale upgrade to Mears will mean some Terraforming as well",t2_bphh3,Blugold,0,1645989085.0,0,t1_hyogq2e,hyogq2e,True,JimTDI,t3_t2utvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/t2utvu/st_paul_removes_trees_in_mears_park_infested_with/,St. Paul removes trees in Mears Park infested with emerald ash borer,/r/saintpaul/comments/t2utvu/st_paul_removes_trees_in_mears_park_infested_with/hyogq2e/,3,r/saintpaul,0,3
"no, you can't just let bullshitters spew bullshit.  Because bullshitters are going to con some non-bullshitters into their bullshit.  It's important to shine a light upon baseless fearmongering claims to prevent the inattentive middle from radicalizing.  Otherwise we risk spawning Tea Party Death Cult 3.0.

Disgust and vitriol have shown themselves to be useful tools.  That being said, there is nothing that supports net migration from the city which is the biggest claim that the right has.  It can be useful to yell ""bullshit, fuck you ya ignorant fuckwad"".

Edit - just looked at the links you share.  You should probably look at them too since the first shows twin cities pop booming.  The 2nd is an opinion article.  On the 3rd article you should look at figure 2 showing non-metro areas having negative growth rates in 2020, pointing to the problem in the 3rd article being birth rate and immigration rate not anything specific to metro areas.",t2_4u95q,Zyphamon,1,1645987994.0,0,t1_hyodxpm,hyodxpm,False,JimTDI,t3_t2pl4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/t2pl4p/the_hottest_neighborhoods_in_minneapolis_and_st/,The hottest neighborhoods in Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2021,/r/saintpaul/comments/t2pl4p/the_hottest_neighborhoods_in_minneapolis_and_st/hyodxpm/,1,r/saintpaul,0,1
