"The question of time and cost of the parts on a PCB is entirely unrealistic to try and answer as that is all down to your skill level and the complexity. Expect you first attempts at fairly simple PCBs to take several hours, and then the time will drop notedly. 

Motherboards or things similar to that that have high signal speeds and many signals are almost always 4 or more copper layers, so that’s not something you can make yourself. The reason for internal layers aren’t just more real state to route on, but also for signal integrity, and EMI as you put a ground plane on one of the internal layers. 

But the other things you describe are more than possible to make on your own, and as your designs get more complex, and you get proficient in making them in a software like Eagle/KiCAD ETC, it’s not that expensive to order small quantity prototype PCBs.",t2_2ugnst1n,Tweetydabirdie,0,1648284898.0,0,t1_i268d2a,i268d2a,True,Inevitable-Gur-3013,t3_tok3tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCB/comments/tok3tp/home_pcb_making/,Home PCB making,/r/PCB/comments/tok3tp/home_pcb_making/i268d2a/,1,r/PCB,0,1

"So this is a small chip used in a Swaptx laser tag system. The important part is 3 contacts on each side, some of them connected through a wire in the middle. Which contacts connected dictates the stats of the laser tag blaster, which is why I'm trying to make my own boards.

">The STM32G4 docs show an internal reset line pullup and there is none in the the reference schematic

Oh okay. I'm used to working with STM32F4s which don't feature that

>They also suggested the 100nF reset cap, which you're right in hindsight is somewhat excessive. I'll scale that down.

It's not so much that it's big, it's that it's big without anything to limit it. Shorting capacitors isn't very healthy for them, as they get a large burst of heat due to the equivalent series resistance, so even a 50-100 Ohm resistor to limit the current will do a lot to keep it within what's healthy for it

>My reason for using the mux as opposed to more MCU IO lines is simply that less traces straight to the main chip allow for more freedom in decoupling cap, crystal, USB data lines etc placement.

that's fair enough, those things are more important after all, but you should also definitely do some pin swapping, because I noticed at least a few places where you could've made things easier for yourself and disrupted the ground plane less. also just in general get the mismatch between the data lines down as much as possible

"Thank you for the fantastic analysis; I was not expecting someone to be so generous with their time!

To answer some of your questions,

The STM32G4 docs show an internal reset line pullup and there is none in the the reference schematic (in the application note doc). They also suggested the 100nF reset cap, which you're right in hindsight is somewhat excessive. I'll scale that down.

My reason for using the mux as opposed to more MCU IO lines is simply that less traces straight to the main chip allow for more freedom in decoupling cap, crystal, USB data lines etc placement. I also have a load of the muxes already for another project, making cost a non-issue.

Yes, I'm going for USB 2.0 FS. Annoyingly I can't seem to find a manner of routing both the VBUS and GND lines *and* the data pair to the TVS diodes while keeping everything short so the length mismatch was something I had to swallow. As you've mentioned, however, they're relatively short.

"I'd tie IO1 & 2 and IO3 & 4 on U2 together. You've already got the diodes, there's no reason not to put them in parallel. 

U4 also seems to be missing a decoupling cap by the Vcc pin? Also in the old datasheet (for CD4067) they recommend tying pin 1/common to one of the rails via a 1k resistor, though I'm not sure how applicable that is on the later model

I can't spot any pull-up for the reset line? I'd only expect pull-down by the capacitor's leakage. And if it were me I'd put a current limiting resistor in there, so that when you press the reset button it doesn't just short the rather large 100nF capacitor

Why connect the shield via a 1M resistor to ground? Isn't it meant to be tied straight to ground? I'm not entirely sure about this, but it just seems odd?

Decoupling also seems kinda low for the regulator, isn't USB fine with up to 15μF without anything else?

In a lot of places you leave the pad at an angle, which is bad for DFM reasons. Go straight out and then bend the trace.

>This reduces the number of traces to route to the MCU by 10 (from 19 to 9)

But why not just use all of your μC's I/O? I mean you've got at least 10 pins spare from what I can tell at a glance, so why buy the extra IC?

>therefore the BOOT0 pin is by default pulled to ground though the trace could be severed and pulled up the nearby VCC breakout pin if I wish to employ the USB DFU bootloader

Why not add both a footprint for one that goes to VCC and one that goes to ground? That way you don't have to cut a trace, and can just desolder a component and solder it on the other pad

>Are the USB traces routed appropriately?

What're you aiming for? USB 2 speeds? If so then almost anything will be fine. I see you've got quite the length/impedance mismatch, although given the path is quite short it might not even be a problem, but whether or not it'll be fine depends on your target spec

>Is the strange ground plane shape a bad decision/will the traces chopping it up cause problems?

There's no reason for the shape to be that small. You pay for all of the copper regardless, so you may as well keep some of it. At least extending it to the analog switch IC would be nice

The traces are a much bigger problem on the other hand and you should reduce as much of the chopping as possible and fix the rest with some via-stitching

>Is a two layer board inherently flawed for this type of STM32 design?

I'm yet to make a 4 layer board with a STM32, and I've made some boards whose schematics needed A3 paper and had well over a hundred components, you're well within the realm of possibility. People are way too quick to hop on over to 4 layer boards and the like.

>Are my values for components (especially those supporting the oscillator) sensible?

Check your crystal's datasheet. It'll have how big the loading capacitors need to be.

>Should I have included an oscillator ground plane cutout and ground ring?

Ground being below is fine, anything else is not. Though if I were you I'd rotate the crystal, so that the traces don't have to cross anything to get to where they're going. Just overall simplify and shorten as much as possible.

But I'd add a ring around it made up of ground vias which you've already nearly got

"Would you mind posting your gerbers and some pictures of the issues on your board?  If we can find what was misinterpreted and contributed to some of the manufacturing mistakes we could all learn from it.  On the flip-side, if we can't find anything wrong it likely tells us something about the manufacturer.

I don't know what feedback JLCPCB provides after they've reviewed SMT assembly data, but for the PCB itself, they provide gerbers for you to review after they've made changes for compatibility with their process, with every layer interpreted and renamed to match their convention. It's good for checking that they didn't mix up any plated and non-plated holes/slots or mix up the copper layer order in the stack-up, somehow merge features that shouldn't be merged, or miss some mounting holes, transpose the top and bottom silkscreen layers, etc.  They provide a .zip file with their interpreted gerber exports for you to review when they ask whether they have your permission to continue with fabrication or if they should hold because you found issues with their interpretation (or caught one of your own goofs after initially submitting the order).",t2_5xt9j,powerload,0,1647019439.0,0,t1_i09hz7i,i09hz7i,True,Cocaine_Hyena,t3_tbnnha,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCB/comments/tbnnha/jlcpcb_fup_order_offers_10_coupon_on_70_order/,"JLCPCB F***Up order, offers $10 coupon on $70 order.",/r/PCB/comments/tbnnha/jlcpcb_fup_order_offers_10_coupon_on_70_order/i09hz7i/,3,r/PCB,0,3

"Not taking sides here in any way, but we are missing a whole lot of information here to make a fair assessment on who messed up what. To many unanswered questions.

A missing hole would seem like your Gerber files and/or PCB designs were incomplete. (Unless they are in fact on the Gerber file) This however would be a error that's hard to make, as they simply feed the file into the machine, and wouldn't edit it to remove a hole. 

And ""missed solder pads"" in this context means what? The pads are not there? Or they aren't soldered? What does the solder mask on the Gerber file look like? Its altogether possible to have a pad there, and no solder being applied if the pad is set incorrectly in the Gerber.

Scratches aren't OK, solder splatter however would be fairly normal for a low series/prototype SMT service, and they are easy to clean up.

For the 'final offer', you didn't specify, was the order value $70, or was that including shipping? For them to offer coupons rather than money back, that's fairly standard practice however. And so is lowballing on the first offer unfortunately.

Depending on weather you are confident in your Gerber files actually being correct or not, you could counter with wanting the PCBs manufactured once again, after having the production material reviewed and returning the ones you got. You'll still pay return shipping if they accept.

"If your experience is only school work, it's likely you lack industry experience, both in terms of the business skills for working with clients, and the actual work itself designing boards.  Freelancing and EE / PCB design are orthogonal skills, so you'll need to improve on both of those domains

"Anyone looking to hire for freelance PCB work is going to be either:

a) Looking for as-cheap-as possible (e.g. Fiverr)

b) Wanting start-to-finish design work (the, ""I have this idea..."" time wasters), or

C) Looking for highly specialized skill (e.g. RF or High Speed Serial.)

\---

In the case of (A), you can put up a profile now. For (B), I'd recommend avoiding those people unless you're talking to an actual engineer who needs a sub-system they don't have time to deal with. And (C), well, requires developing a highly specialized skill.

There is far more involved in ""Designing PCBs"" than just drawing some traces to connect components together and sending the design to an Asian manufacturer. Real design require requires impedance matching, watching creepages, reliability considerations, mechanical considerations, and designing for manufacturing. e.g. How many of the boards have you designed so far did not suffer from flex cracking ceramic capacitors? (If the answer is 0, you clearly haven't designed enough yet!)

Unless you happen to be really good at all of those things, that's where you need to start. Design PCBs that'll stand up to CE or UL testing, are designed with high-speed signaling (USB 3, DDR, etc), and maximize panel space.

Once you have 100+ or so designs completed on shipping products, then you're ready to sell your freelance services for real money.

"You can either look for or design a component for it. There is a search in the Library tab for placing/finding parts that lets you search in user contributed parts (search things like ""rubber dome"" or ""rubber pad"")

You can also design your own using some exposed copper traces, as a pattern of two sets of interleaved fingers like [this](http://www.rfcafe.com/references/electrical/images/key-fob-2.JPG). The rubber pad just shorts the two contacts together. I think the design of the rubber pad side is outside the scope of a PCB though.

For designing a component you have to create a symbol and footprint then link the symbol to the footprint. This may be a bit annoying, particularly in easyeda so see if you can find any preexisting footprints.

"OK - 

i didnt realize what colors were what. The photo of the 'purple' looks almost black on my screen , so it looked like the eyes were a 3rd color.

&#x200B;

 makes more sense now that i turned my screen brightness up hahaha.

so just to double check my eyes see the right thing:

&#x200B;

you used purple solder mask yes? 

and you had to scrape the  purple s#!t off the FRONT of the PCB... correct? 

then yes - most likely you didnt remove, the solder mask on the top layer in that area, buti do see  you did do the copper & i can see in the un scraped one that the sun does come thru a little bit so the only thing thats still there is just that one soldermask layer...... 

most likely for some reason  -maybe a bug in EDA- it wont show you this

or maybe you did remove but a bug on the output. 

you clearly included a soldermask file as youve done holdback elsewhere. and i would think JLC would hold order if the file didnt work at all.

so yes gerber viewer would be next step ....or...

doesnt JLC do  a preview online? can u post that? at least to see what they thought of the files you uploaded.

also I frequently message them with questions and they are pretty good about telling you that your files caused the problem hahahah. but maybe is also a mistake on their end it does happen... usally with assembly hah.

 CNY is over now so theyshould be p quick with a response.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

just to recap my most important comment:

 you need to remove the soldermask on top/bottom and copper top/bottom in that area for it to work.  im sure you know this but - thats the trick to make 'clear'

&#x200B;

in eagle::

 i would draw a shape to denote an area that solder mask would be held back from

and for copper layer i would have to draw an shape that excluded that area (basically a copper pour shape with a hole in it\*\*)

re: gerber viewers...

&#x200B;

so most (free) gerber viewers ive found suck. please somoene post one they like if they have the feels. Im also an eagle user for 15+ years so if there is one in KiCad or Diptrace (or altium) i def havent found that one but i like new tools.

i used to use web ones and just google a new one each time hoping for a batter one, but, i found this tool suite that is fantastic. It has a gerber viewer in it that worked p good in the end (or maybe it sucked too?).

">	Well, riddle me this then, how does those cheap pc’s enumerate USB 2.0? Since any USB 3.x port needs to be USB 2.0 compatible. That’s enumerated on CC line.

Consider this: USB3 plug has no CC line. Yet it also needs to be USB2 compatible. How does that work?  When you plug in a type-c or a USB3 the computer detects connection on both USB2/USB3 and enumerates them.  CC line isn’t involved at all*.   

*It can be used to detect orientation and use a mux to switch to one or the other... but muxes cost money and built in USB ports don’t.  Either way they don’t have any communication to enumerate that. 

>	And unless that gets the correct response on the CC line, it should not allow more than 100mAh on the VBUS at all. That breaks spec in a very catastrophical way.

There's several layers here. Type-C port will not put out power at all unless it sees the correct CC signal/impedance. Everyone just sticks 2 resistors on there for peripheral device, and that works unless you want >5v.  You can even use passive type-c to regular USB cables and they have the resistors built in!   

Next, forget about 100mA or 200mA. Nobody does that. The lowest current limit I've seen is 700 mA (for 500mA with tolerances). This will work even if you don't have any USB2 or USB3 lines at all. Most powerbanks don't have USB2, USB3 or CC controllers.  In fact many power banks even have silly things like ""I will start drawing power until I get cut-off, then I reset and draw right below that limit"" which is a silly thing.  It's due to the fact that before type-c we had no easy way to determine how much we can draw on the high side. (don't get me started on BC spec).

As for usb power, you are slightly mistaken. I do not believe anyone still complies with the 100 mA limit (desktop/laptop/psu) as it turned out it’s too much work to ask to be switched to 500mA.

"There’s a bunch of companies making all sorts of chips.

They are all programmed in c with varying support for c++ (except cheapest parts are still somewhat assembly).

Arduino is an ide with some language extensions.  Every manufacturer gives you a new ide and there’s little standardization sadly. It’s often painful to use them too.

The cheapest chips are only Pennies a piece. Those require programming in assembly. They have few memory. Those are used for devices like your toothbrush.  They are slow (<8mhz) and only have tens of bytes of ram and maybe low hundreds bytes of rom. These are fairly hard/painful to use so they are uncommon.

Next level up are mid range mcu. are 30-100c apiece. Sometimes they have floating point addition. Here is a huge amount of diversity.  These chips  do so much: for example these are the chips in remote controls, children toys, abs brake, 3d printers, refrigerators, microwaves/appliances, etc.  8-80mhz. Usually have kilobytes of flash.  This is where most of arduino supported mcu are.

Next level is powerful mcu. They usually cost dollars a piece. They sometimes have fancy additions like memory controller, support for external memory/display, sometimes DSP.  Some chips support wifi, Bluetooth, etc in this range.  Almost always some support for rtos.  These are used in things that need more; for example game wireless controllers, thermostats, wireless lightbulbs, lcd picture frames.  esp32 fall into this category.  They usually have megabytes of flash and tens to hundreds kb of ram. 80-400mhz

"Some dimensions would be helpful find one that fits if you have calipers handy.  That very much appears to be the footprint for an SMD version of what's typically referred to as a ""tact"" or ""tactile"" switch.  They typically have 4 leads, but some versions have that 5th lead to connect the metal on the top of the switch to PCB or chassis GND for ESD protection.  Two leads are connected on each side, and all four are momentarily connected when you push the button (in normally open switches).  I don't think I've seen normally closed flavors of these but I'm sure they exist.  Some switches are ""squishy"", but these are very ""snappy"" giving you tactile feedback so you know when it's ""switched"" and making electrical contact.  A 4-lead version will absolutely work fine if you're not concerned about zapping the circuit from body static when you press the button.  The switches come in different heights and shapes depending on the application and housing.

"The highest frequency in your PCB would be the rise / fall time of the signal and not the clock rate, you should take a look at the IO rise and fall time and do your calculations according to it.
LVDS should be terminated at the load, as some one else suggested you can try to move the resistors closer to the connector but if following that connector there is a long distance (accordingto the rise time) then the termination won't serve its purpose. The connector itself would create a change in impedance that can cause reflections. It's hard to tell exactly what will happen without knowing the other side of the connections, if this is for something that is going to be manufactured, tested and sold you should consider termination at the other end and remove termination at your PCB (you should also think about EMI in that case)
If this is only intended for you or a small project it might be OK the way it is.
It's hard to tell from the picture but have you kept matched impedance in both layers? You should also add vias for the return path to move layers too.
Lastly, try to get a hold of ""Right the First Time: A Practical Handbook on High Speed PCB and System Design"", it's really good and in topic.

"They're exceeding the absolute maximum ratings no doubt about that (max 4.25V for the chip, and +0.3V over that for any input pin)

Though they're exceeding it in a way that's more mild, as it's current limited by a 4.7KOhm resistor.

But still it's less than sub-optimal and probably caused problems, hence the updated design doing it the proper way with the level-shifter.

But the proper way isn't neccesarily what's needed for you. The GitHub link's schematic also has a 5V temperature sensor on the same bus, but you don't have that so you don't need to worry about level shifting or anything to that. In the other schematic they don't know what it'll be connected to, so just assume a 5V device.

The voltage regulator is there again because the chip will die if you apply more than 4.25V to the supply pins, but the input pins are a generally a bit more tough.

"It's easier to inspect an assembled board for shorts when the pads are consistently filled. As you add more copper coming out of the pad, the solder mask aperture allows for ever increasing amount of solder spread on that pad versus the others.  
  
For chip Rs and Cs, uneven heat distribution and tension (if one pad has multiple entries, and the other doesn't) increases the likelihood of tombstoning.

Common (except that it's not that common given that it's tied to 3V instead of 0V) gate amplifier used as a level shifter from 5V of the sensor to 3.3V of the micro presumably

If the output is low on the right side, then the MOSFET will turn on as Vgs would be 3V, which would pull the voltage down on the left side, registering a 0

If the output is low on the left side, then the diode will pull down the voltage on the right side, also registering a 0

If none of them are pulling down, then it'll just be pulled up to the rails the resistors go to, registering a 1 at the voltage levels used by the devices

"It sounds like you have got it. Just remember that the ""ink"" can be different processes:
* Toner from a laser printer ironed onto the copper in a home process.
* Photosensitive resist that gets exposed to UV light through a transparency (you can buy boards pre-coated with resist) after it is exposed, chemicals develop and remove the exposed parts like film.
* you can get resist pens and rub on transfers that let you just draw the tracks and pads.

If you get your boards made by one of the many online PCB services, you can also get the board coated with a solder mask material which leaves the copper only exposed where you solder. They also let you label the board, which makes the results the same as commercial products.

Also, PCB services usually do what is called through plating, which is a process that adds copper inside the holes in the board, which connects the sides (or layers) together. That also makes soldering easier, because if you have tracks on both sides, you don't have to worry about soldering both sides of every lead.

Finally on this topic, they offer a number of different board materials, which becomes very important in radio frequency or high speed digital boards because the insulation material changes how radio waves travel in the tracks! And if you are doing high power stuff (like power LED boards, etc.) there are aluminum boards! Those are to conduct heat from components really well. My understanding is that aluminum replaces the fiberglass and is somehow insulated from the copper and the component holes. I don't know exactly how they do it, but it is an option.

It's now possible and reasonable to design a 3 to 8+ layer board and have several copies in your hands in just a few days! You basically design the layers using a program and send them a file with all the layers.

"So, sorry to come back, but I've done quite abit of research over the past day or so, and I think I understand the process to a T now.

Please allow me to list the steps, and correct me if I've got anything wrong.

1) The PCB is a 3 (or more) layered board. Going Copper <> Fibreglass (or other insulating material) <> Copper.

2) both Copper layers cover the entire surface with Copper at the beginning.

3) We print then transfer our PCB track layouts from paper to the Copper layer. There is multiple ways to do this, no one perfect way, no one-size-fits-all method.

4) Usually, the inked areas are where our traces will be at the end of the process.

5) Using (I believe Ferric Chrloride), we melt/disintegrate/remove all of the completely exposed (uninked) Copper from the Copper layer. This leaves our ""protected"" inked Copper areas.

6) Using Acetone, the ink is removed, leaving only the Copper traces/wires that were once protected by the ink. This is how the tracks/traces/wires are made which are isolated away from other tracks/traces/wires because we chemically removed all the other Copper.

7) This can be done on both sides of the board, to give extra space to work with.

8) Drilling through marked holes is how we then connect both layers where needed; soldering through the holes and connecting one layer to the other.

9) solder our components into place. Using Liquid Tin can make this a much easier job, and simultaneously makes it harder for our Copper traces to corrode.

Have I got this right? I think I've got a good grasp on the manufacturing process now.

This chaps video is how I came to understand it: https://youtu.be/au2ba5gWLWk

Ofcourse, more than 3 layers (Copper <> Fibreglass<> Copper) gets trickier and trickier, but only for crazy complex projects.

"Your design relies on the protection for that transistor being off-board. This isn't great practice. Generally it's best to not assume/trust that any off-board signals are safe, so any protection that the circuitry needs should be on that circuit itself.

Your design also relies on all of your transistors being well matched. Due to unavoidable manufacturing differences, they won't be. In this case, the problem is that when you connect the output of one board to the input of the other, the base of Q2 on the first is going to be in parallel with the base of Q1 on the second. What this means is that if one transistor has a much lower forward voltage than the other, it will pull the voltage of the whole line too low for the higher voltage transistor to turn on. The more boards you connect to a single output, the more likely this is to become a problem. Further, your pullup resistor is limiting the amount of current that the output can supply. This may be enough to turn on one or two other transistors, but more than that is going to be an issue.

For reference, [this datasheet](https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/p2n2222a-d.pdf) of the 2n2222 lists the forward voltage as being anywhere between 0.6V and 1.2V for an otherwise identical base and collector current.

This can be all fairly easily fixed by using a push-pull output stage, and using a base resistor on the input transistor so that it can handle it. This will also make it easier to interface with other input and output sources such as a signal generator, arduino, more LEDs, etc.

I should also note that it may be easier to use mosfets instead of bjts. This will make the design of your output stage slightly easier and more robust, and since they need ^virtually no input current it will reduce the demand on your output stage if it's got multiple inputs connected to it at once. If you can shop online you shouldn't have much trouble finding p-channel mosfets in a to-92 package, but the chances of a local store stocking them may be slimmer. Mosfets may cost slightly more than bjts especially at bulk rates, so keep that in mind if you're planning to build lots of these.",t2_myp2a,SaltlessLemons,0,1643194977.0,0,t1_hua39ww,hua39ww,False,GodGecko,t3_scl30s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCB/comments/scl30s/had_a_go_at_designing_a_pcb_its_just_a_simple_not/,"Had a go at designing a PCB.

"Your routing itself looks very reasonable and logically laid out especially for a first attempt, but there's also a few headscratchers

No base resistor at all? No resistor between base and emitter for biasing either?

Your output voltage will be capped to Vbe (~0.7V) without them and when the input is floating they'll act very unpredictably as it'll act as an antenna picking up random noise

Also the resistors you do have are lusciously big? Why wouldn't some significantly smaller ¼W ones do the trick?

Why opt for a jst connector for power? Wouldn't it be easier to just re-use the 2 big pinheaders you've already got, in fact wouldn't it be easier to just use that single header for power, signal input and signal output?

For reverse engineering of them I'd recommend checking out Ken Shiriff's website righto.com and r/ReSilicon 

For DIY semiconductors check out Sam Zeloof on YouTube

But semiconductor equipment also gets real expensive real fast, maybe it might be a good idea to do a DIY source measure unit?

"Seems pretty ambitious

At my tech college they have a CNC for making PCBs, it's really loud, but a lot of the noise is severely attenuated because it's in a sealed container with its own exhaust system hooked up to the building's

I think it's going to be hard to find a quiet solution, as you're going to be spinning it at high RPMs you're going to inevitably get a lot of high frequency noise which stands out a lot more than a low frequency hum

I think your best bet is just enclosing and dampening that noise

Otherwise doing it with chemicals is probably what you should go for, but the results from my experience is worse. Maybe I was just bad at it, but I'd always get small pieces of ground plane missing here and there and it'd take significantly longer especially with all the holes you have to drill.

"You need decoupling capacitors on the power lines. 
For communication lines (like SPI) a ""good practice"" is to add some inline resistors (usually 100 ohms). The resistors will be placed on each line close to the transmitter source. You should also look at the datasheets for the i2c. Sometimes they require some inline resistors (to protect from potential spikes).

When you start designing the pcb, be careful to have wider traces for power and ground. If possible, ground plane flooding on all layers, with vias space every 10mm is a good practice. Also route the communication signals parallel to each other and as far as possible from the power signal. Another best practice is to have a gnd shield around the communication lines.

"If EMI is your main concern, 4L PCBs normaly have Vsuply and GND as planes in layers 2&3. Because for high frequency, Vsupply and GND are seen as GND, and both top and bottom signal layers have their own return path, which leads to small EM fields. In addition to to that, you have also created a little capacitor, wich helps stableize your Vsupply. If you buy your PCBs, most time 4L is almost the same price as 2L.
However, if you would like to stay with 2L, you might want to watch out, to not cross 2 signal layers without GNDs around, as you might create a slot antenna and have high EMI.

"How hot? How much processing are you doing on the chip? Are you using WiFi?

The sheet also has some great data on RF power consumption, which when using WiFi will translate to heat.

"It is an inductor. 180 uH. Can't really tell much beyond that, and package size if you measured it. Based on that you could probably estimate rough saturation current. Let's call it 2A as a wild guess.

What goes into that connector? Fan? LEDs?

I'm guessing the GPU still works, but whatever that peripheral is probably won't. 

My first thought would be to just try resoldering it on. You could try dead bugging it if you're unable to solder it back in place in the normal orientation.

"Ok I’m gonna take a shot at this.  

You are trying to make a 555 led flasher with adjustable duty cycle and two leds.  

The layout is a nightmare but I tried to decipher it.  

https://i.imgur.com/PtaPG5M.jpg

This is a poorly drawn schematic of your layout.  Basically it seems you copied the standard 555 led flasher schematic but then tried to add pots to control your duty cycle and then also added a transistor that is completely unnecessary and not functional in the way it is connected.  

Try this poorly drawn schematic instead. 

https://i.imgur.com/VqtQ6e2.jpg

It does away with all the transistor nonsense and simplifies the duty cycle/frequency pots.  You may need to double the values of the pots to give more control.  This would put the fixed resistor values from the standard 555 schematic at about the midpoint on the knob. 

P.S. 
I put very little effort in this analysis so there may be mistakes but I think I have addressed the big issues of the weird transistor situation and all the extra resistors.  

Here is a link to a page about this 555 flasher. 

http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/LED-flasher-circuit.php

P.S.S.
My guess is that you either thought the transistor was necessary to get the second Led to flash (it isn’t) or you thought it would work for some sort of control (it won’t).

I'm guessing a reasonable phone-repair place will be able to do this for you in a few minutes - they might even have a collection of USB sockets where one will fit.

"To solder this you will need at minimum a copper desoldering braid, and a good soldering iron, with a medium tip (1-2mm). Also a flux pen or similar to make the soldering easier.

I’d recommend a soldering pump as well, but not necessary. 

To start with, clean up the two pads with holes/slits. Add solder to melt the existing solder, then clean it away with braid or solder pump until a new socket can sit flat with the tabs in the hole. The other pads can be mostly left as is, with simply adding some flux once re-soldering 

Remember to heat efficiently in short intervals, and let the PCB cool down now and again so you don’t overheat it and lift the pads. 

Soldering the replacement you put it in place, put a little pressure on the socket and heat one of the corner pads, to fasten it and push it down flat. Then repeat for the other corner pad. If necessary alternate the two, until the socket sits flat and square and the four pins make contact with their pads. 

Solder the small pins in short bursts, letting things cool. Adding flux and then melting the tin, finish by pulling the solder tip backwards from the socket to make the tin not bridge two pads. If it still does, add a little extra and clean off with the braid.

"> Can I pick any replacement socket that meets or exceed the amperage of the power cord?

Most USB sockets have similar ratings. In this case, it does not matter. The two data pins have no resistors connected to them, so the device likely only expects to be able to draw 100 mA. 

> With how tiny the pins are, is there a strategy to soldering?

Hot air is the best method for USB-micro sockets. A fine tip conical (cone shaped) works as well. In this case, you only care about the far left and far right pins, which are the +5V and GND pins.

Just make sure the data pins (in the middle) are not shorted.

The point to point connection method is brain-dead simple, pin 1 goes to pin 1, so I think it might've been someone's first PCB experiment or something?

Using power planes is a lot better, you get more copper, less resistance and since the current path to and from are parallel with eachother you get less impedance, which is better for transients and that's something graphics cards are getting increasingly picky about

I'd be worried about the separated one's current handling capability though, traces probably won't be too thick with that little space, so how heavy the copper they used (typical is 1 or 2 oz) is probably the biggest factor, and might be why they switched to large planes instead?

Close to those you will find an ESD protection circuit to absorb the energy and send it to ground through the power supply or USB depending on what your PCB actually is, without going through the sensitive parts of the electronics. 

The other end of the PCB has these type of mounting holes with no copper on them. The reason is that if these were to connect to the case, the ESD spike would bypass the protection and instead go through the circuit to get to ground. And that usually results in the magic smoke escaping.",t2_2ugnst1n,Tweetydabirdie,0,1640781217.0,0,t1_hqeiutr,hqeiutr,False,Imnarnian,t3_rqmngf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCB/comments/rqmngf/how_to_remove_copper_and_solder_mask_in_eagle/,How to remove copper and solder mask in EAGLE?

"To detect a button press you need either an interupt or regularly poll the bus. To start with this you wil need to look up how to set up an interupt ( not all IO can do this on all busses, look in the hardware manual) or you set up an event loop (sometimes called a ""main loop"") that checks the bus at intervals.

"As someone who worked on directed energy weapons for the us military (all very high current applications) i can tell you we always thermal relief our stuff.

The fusing current of the copper doesnt *really* change due to the heatsinking of the copper around it.

You should always be thermal relieving throughhole components connected to large copper pours unless they are press fit or mounting features. I honestly cant think of any other situation not to unless you are relying on the copper for heatsinking (common on GAN devices , or devices that cool the board through drain pins, or cabling)

"(edit: I noticed posting from mobile kinda messed up the formatting so I fixed some of it)


Kinda hard to tell from the pic but, if the color bands are orange, yellow (extremely faded), red, then those are 3.4kohm resistors.

Considering how beefy they are, the only thing I'm not sure on is their power rating, but you can look up images of resistors with different power ratings and see which ones are the best match. That being said, it's better to overshoot on power rating than to undershoot, so aim higher. I can tell you right now it's definitely between 1/4W and 50W. Probably closer to the 1/4 end.

Lastly, in case you're not familiar on how to read a resistor, the gold (sometimes silver) band should always be to the right. This let's you know you're holding it and therefore reading it right. From left to right, the first two bands are the first two digits of the number of ohms. The last band is the power of 10 that you multiple that 2 digit number by, and that product is your total resistance

Black=0,
Brown=1,
Red=2,
Orange=3,
Yellow=4,
Green=5,
Blue=6,
Purple=7,
Gray=8,
White=9,

"If I were to do it, just bring the completed breadboard to me. You asked how to get from a breadboard to a pcb via someone. Not a schematic to a pcb.

Schematic can be easily made from the breadboard, simply a matter of add info all the components on your breadboard and then wirings the connections between them. This is then turned to a board file.

Yes, there are details such as what size the pcb should be, any peripheral connectors, mounting options (think holes for screws/standoffs/etc)

But this isn’t a difficult task and can be easily accomplished with free software: easyeda, Eagle, etc. 

I also agree if you have any interest in electronics that you teach yourself easyeda or the like. A skill that comes in very handy, quite often, for an electronics hobbyist and beyond!

Cheers!

"I dig my TS100 iron -- it puts out a fair amount of heat, works nicely. Not sure what your budget is, or if you plan on doing more stuff in the future. Looks like the TS100 is \~75 bucks on amazon, probably cheaper on Aliexpress / bangood etc.

Yeah, you can definitely repair boards. I've done all sorts of repairs before. The thing is, I'd consider that a level above just soldering the keys in.

Like, I'd put the key soldering at say 4/10 difficulty, and the repairs required for your board at like 6/10. Not impossible, but if you can't master the basics first, you're just going to dig yourself a deeper hole until it becomes practically unfixable.

The more time you fiddle with a board, the more chance that you lift traces, damage parts, melt plastic, and get ugly solder joins.

Like I said, maybe buy a ""learn to solder"" practice kit -- there are a bunch of cheap ones on amazon, $10-15 bucks, and they often make fun projects. Once you get the skill down, you can re-examine this board.

I will say -- having used crappy soldering irons and solder vs pro end stuff ($1000+ irons) -- the nicer the equipment, the easier it is. Treat yourself to decent equipment -- it will make the work a lot less frustrating. Having a microscope or magnifying glasses can really help with fiddly stuff as well.

&#x200B;

Here's the kit of stuff I wouldn't leave home without:

**Mandatory:**

Liquid / paste flux (you can buy syringes of flux -- convenient)

Lead Solder (thinner is better in general for small stuff.)

Wet sponge

TS100 or equivalent

DMM / multimeter (cheap is fine, useful for voltage / continuity testing)  
Solder sucker and / or braided copper solder wick

**Good to Have:**

Spare tips

Kapton tape

X-acto knife plus plenty of replacement blades. Sharp blades help cut much better, less risk of damaging stuff.

Thin (34 gauge?) enamel wire with insulation that can be burned off by the heat of the iron (not all wire is like this)

Nice pair of side cutters (buy a name-brand. Can get pricey)

Microscope / magnifying glasses (good for small stuff, could get pricey if you buy the microscope)

&#x200B;

All in, for maybe $100 - $150 you could have a really nice kit of tools. 

You can get away with not having a lot of that stuff, but you'll find it's really frustrating sometimes to not have stuff on that list.

"Honestly, I'd recommend putting this thing on a shelf, and buying a new one, as well as a cheap practice thing. When you have some more skills, you can come back to this and try and fix it.

Watch some youtube videos on how to solder, get some leaded solder (not lead free), get some flux, get a solder-sucker tool, get tip tinning paste, and make sure you're using a decent iron. These days there are a lot more choices, but make sure you're using something that has enough power to solder to GND planes.

The  biggest thing in soldering is this: when you are soldering two items together, make sure that the biggest thing gets the heat preferentially. The problem you'll often run into is GND planes that are huge and suck all the heat away. If you spend 5 minutes with the iron on the tiny component, you're going to damage it. In this case, it's better to heat up the GND plane, then when solder starts to flow on to it, touch the component as well.

The other big thing to remember: Add solder to the component, not the iron. Eg, if you're trying to solder to a wire, it's much better to wet the iron with a small amount of solder, touch the wire, let it get hot, then add solder by touching the wire. When the wire is hot enough, it will flow nicely. If you add it to the iron, you run the risk of just blobbing solder down.

Finally, flux makes stuff floooow. You can get solder with flux in it, but it's better to buy the paste as well. Flux burns off quickly, so if heat up the solder too long, it will stop flowing nicely. You can fix this by putting flux paste on it.",t2_3bhwz,hex4def6,0,1639015388.0,0,t1_hnsss6r,hnsss6r,False,Mood_Defiant,t3_rbimdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCB/comments/rbimdg/i_messed_up_while_soldering_and_desoldered_some/,"I messed up while soldering and desoldered some parts, i am a noob but im wondering if i can get help finding out whats the problem (leds are not lighting up to the patterns, top two rows don’t work but respond to the light pattern)",/r/PCB/comments/rbimdg/i_messed_up_while_soldering_and_desoldered_some/hnsss6r/,0,r/PCB,0,0

"So no way I can tell you what the problem is, this is a mess and I'm guessing my first project looked pretty similar to yours. It will be helpful to practice soldering. Getting a halfway decent iron will spare you a lot of trouble in the beginning. Watch some YouTube tutorials, pay attention to flowing and cold joints in particular, you don't want those big gray lobs, you want shiny properly adhered joints. It's not that difficult but it takes some practice. Then just get some old PCBs from any old junk and get practicing. Or get practice boards, they're a few dollars from China and aimed at beginners. Practice good hygiene, that means no crap on the soldering tip because if it oxidizes it won't properly hold solder. Always leaving a thin layer of solder helps with that. Also, get some lead solder, it's way easier than lead free. Seriously, it takes a few hours to get the hang of it if you have some decent tutorials. Getting good takes longer.

I found this out the hard way after some of my boards came back with the center pads for some QFN packages missing due to the polygons I'd used to stretch that ground pad out the corners of the package, but it looks like Altium is smart enough to at least warn you about this, even if it's not smart enough to not have this issue.

"High-volume electronics world was mostly started by Americans to standardize things across many different manufacturers, thus is why many early standards were inch based units.  As production started migrating towards Asia after mid 1950s, over time multiples of metric units started to become more prolific for standards.

* In 1920s, 50 AM radio manufacturers in Chicago formed the ""Radio Manufacturers Association"" (RMA), which created many early electronics standards in the 1920s & 1930s, such as resistor & capacitor color codes, E-series component value numbering system (1.0 / 1.5 / 2.2 / 3.3 / 4.7 / 6.8), vacuum tube numbering, ...

* In 1940s, WWII war caused numerous American military standards to be created, so many different companies could build similar shaped components for two-way RF communication / radar devices / other military devices.  Numerous standards in many industries were heavily influenced by WWII war production all over the world.

* In 1950s, portable transistor radios refined international electronics standards as production migrated from USA to Japan.

* In 1960s, space race and cold war influenced standards and technology.

I assume the Americans started (or had influence) for these connector pitch widths:

* 0.050"" (1.27mm) - SO IC package was an early SMD IC pitch, half of 0.1""

* 0.100"" (2.54mm) - DIP IC package caused a major influence in the popularity of this pitch, as well as increments of 0.1"" 

* 0.156"" (3.96mm) - rounded 5/32 fraction (0.15625"")

* 0.200"" (5.08mm)

* 0.250"" (6.35mm)

* 0.300"" (7.62mm)

Are you looking to get a gerber only (essentially an image of the copper layers), or an actual schematic with the components, and a PCB design that can then be turned into the gerber files and a .BOM to produce more PCBs. 

Is the PCB single/dual layer or does it have internal layers?

Are the components through hole or surface mounted (or a mix)? Are they identifiable or have ICs been sanded/obscured to remove the labeling?
