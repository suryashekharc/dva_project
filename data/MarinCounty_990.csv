"Thanks for the helpful info. I looked into GGT, but I like the ferry for a few reasons: it's a 10 minute walk from the ferry building to my office and it's a 10 minute drive from the ferry to my house, no need to get on the 101. Thus, I can avoid traffic in its entirety and door to door it should be about an hour. The GGT would be about an hour on the bus alone and the last stop at Salesforce is pretty far from my office.

I have an old Camry that already has a lot of scratches so not too worried about getting dinged but will be on the lookout for that.

"Nice that your company reimburses commute costs - I get a stipend but it gets nowhere near covering the ferry to SF. The ferry is stupid expensive for commuting, and worse if you're paying for the parking (which used to be free). 


I can't comment on existing capacity, but pre-covid it exceeded capacity by the end of the morning. 


A few other thoughts:


1) Have you considered the bus (GGT)? For me in southern marin, between getting to the ferry, parking, leaving parking lot (huge PITA when its full), cattle call of getting on/off ferry, and distance to my office, bus was way faster and less annoying. Obvi this is affected by your home/office proximity to ferry/bus, and the available bus lines. GGT cut a bunch of good bus routes/times. Bus is also way cheaper but sounds like not a concern for you.


2) Careful parking there. The parking spots are super small and people drive like shit.

Then on top of that when you‚Äôre saying they were going to let the homeless guy off on a citation‚Ä¶you can thank prop 47 for that. A lot of crimes you used to be able to take people to jail for are now cited and released. That‚Äôs not a police problem.

"SRPD has become a joke of an agency. To be fair- they are short staffed, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse their indifference to crime when they arrive on scene. Many of the officers I have dealt with in recent years are far more concerned with being social justice warriors than they are enforcing the law- they are glorified social workers (bringing blankets to bums, administering narcan to junkies, etc).
SRPD turns a blind eye to homeless related crimes‚Ä¶ I have filed countless reports/called numerous times over the years for incidents involving bums breaking in to private property/stealing, bums destroying private property. I have even had to call for a bum high on meth openly masturbating in a private/highly visible parking lot (in broad daylight)- the location was less than .5 miles from the station and it took SRPD 40 mins to respond. The worst part?!? If hadn‚Äôt insisted on signing a citizens arrest, SRPD was going to cite the guy and release him!! Keep in mind, when SRPD arrived on scene, they caught him naked ‚Äúcommitting the offensive act‚Äù - he was surrounded by pornographic magazines AND they found meth & a pipe on him- yet SRPD was going to let him go with a citation/court date!! My husband is LE for a different agency, so I knew that If I signed  a citizen arrest form they would have to book him (but the responding officers never made that option available to me- I needed to request it!).
Another very upsetting ongoing issue I have w/ SRPD- there is a group of 5+ known felons/drug dealers (some of which have been arrested for unregistered fire arms) who stand on Tamalpias Ave all day long- loitering on the sidewalk- blasting music/drinking tall cans out of paper bags and deal drugs right out in the ope, they make ZERO effort to hide what they are doing. This operation has been going on for 3years‚Ä¶ I have reported them to SRPD countless times, and I have asked officers to occasionally drive down Tamalpias Ave hoping that added police presence would deter the to blatant criminal behavior- but they refuse to do anything about it. All of the officers I have spoken to are aware of the drug dealing- they know it is a huge problem/is bringing crime to the area‚Ä¶ but they will not take action. I work in property management right downtown and we have had to resort to hiring private security to patrol our complexes 2x every night to deter break-ins & homeless trespassing. We have had to add 8 security cameras at one of the complexes (cameras only document crimes as they are being committed - unfortunately cameras don‚Äôt deter drug addicted vagrants from breaking in/burglarizing the building ). So every time some drug addicted bum breaks into the secure complex- I have to download the security footage of the crime, put it on a flash drive and take it to SRPD because they will not do any of the legwork themselves. They won‚Äôt even come to the building to view the footage/take a report. 

I want to make it known- that I have great respect for LE, I Know what a stressful/thankless job it is. But SRPD has some serious issues with their officers- maybe there is a moral problem w/ in the department?!? I do know that a majority of SRPD officers do not live in Marin/San Rafael- they are not from the area, I get the impression that because they do not live in the area, they do not have a connection to the community and therefor are not proactive about preventing crime/holding offenders accountable and preserving safe/clean neighborhoods for it‚Äôs residents. It DID NOT used to be this way, 20+ years ago San Rafael PD  had an upstanding team of officers who prided themselves in maintaining safe/clean neighborhoods‚Ä¶ but almost all

"adding this in late, but my impression was that the mansions in Ross were mostly built in the 60's (e.g. https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/21-Canyon-Rd-Ross-CA-94957/19272771_zpid/) .  You can check the construction dates of the  mansions on Zillow.  

The money was *mostly* corporate from the beginning days of the finance industry in SF.  But maybe some Levi money and real estate money or some of the left-over railroad baron $.

"1. Basically white people are the upper class, Latin American are the working class. Anything considered white nowadays, like Jewish and all variety of European. Latin American I am pretty sure predominantly Mexican and Guatemalan.

2. Ross is mega-rich. Owning a high end Lexus and sporting a fresh new Patagonia sweater and iPhone is the bare minimum. Some people have a private driveway with their collection of 10 luxury cars including Rolls Royces. I heard someone had a private helicopter once, no idea how that‚Äôs possible though in terms of actually taking off. There are some solid down to earth relatable and very friendly, good people there but there are definitely some really stereotypical Marin people‚Ä¶ extreme affluence makes people full of themselves, sometimes. They can‚Äôt believe they would have to deal with an inconvenience, sometimes, like standing in line, or fighting over their husband‚Äôs estate with their maid who managed to get them to include them in their will or something. Plenty of botoxed 60 year olds, and mega high end power yoga studios and so on. In some ways Ross is the most concentrated version of Marin, it‚Äôs an insanely white, super rich suburbia. People can be as fundamentally kind, intelligent and humane as anywhere but there‚Äôs probably a pretty big expectation for things like getting into top-notch private schools or just a really luxurious kind of leisure lifestyle. I heard housewives of Ross doing coke together is a real thing.

3. Marin has the stereotype of being really liberal Green hippie and the average is probably skewed that way, like I think even the conservatives are relatively pro environment and marijuana and stuff like that. But especially amongst many rich people people are a bit more conservative in some ways - racism against Blacks I have seen firsthand - pretty pro-Israel, lots of Jewish people overall - support for center-conservative figures like Mitt Romney, like free market economics and stuff like anti-socialism, against public services and so on. People enjoy and want to maintain the class hierarchy. It could not be more palpable and evident in Marin, the rich whites with mansion and the Mexicans who work as busboys in restaurants and butchers in the grocery store. As soon as you hop over to Fairfax you get people who are more or less stereotypical Green Party people.

4. I have no idea what it was like in the 60s but more recently young people are probably pretty sheltered and privileged but still open minded and good people.",t2_ezrsngk9,jssmith42,0,1647879400.0,0,t1_i1jnwg0,i1jnwg0,True,MemishInvestor,t3_tdf1fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marin/comments/tdf1fo/questions_about_ross_ca_for_a_book/,"Questions about Ross, CA for a book",/r/Marin/comments/tdf1fo/questions_about_ross_ca_for_a_book/i1jnwg0/,2,r/Marin,0,2
"Point Reyes without question or that whole general area. Like Shell Beach on the Tamales Bay, Drake‚Äôs Beach. 100% magical over there.

Top of Tam is impressive in its own way but it doesn‚Äôt have this raw overpowering beauty that Pt Reyes has.

I also find drives through the Valley (San Geronimo) to be some of the most inspiring views in the area.

The best hike I know is Taramancho, really nice rolling hills and a lot of varied open expanses and views and so on.

A really cool discovery I made later in my life is Muir Beach. It‚Äôs so cool how these big boats come through there sometimes, like industrial or shipping boats or something. It‚Äôs just an interesting conjunction somehow, because you‚Äôre not expecting it as much in that environment.

Insalata‚Äôs is a really excellent restaurant, the food‚Äôs great, as is its sister restaurant Marinitas.

I always go to Robson Park in San Anselmo when I just need to cook off in a way and lie down somewhere. Listened to a lot of music there. And can walk through the Seminary (Christian training center) right nearby on the way there or back.

For some down-home comforts or just good vibes I‚Äôd definitely go to Barton‚Äôs Bagels, Bubbas  or Hildas or the Easy Street Cafe or the Half Day cafe (some of these places may have closed by now), Comforts, Woodlands in Kentfield/Ross, the Good Earth grocery store / cafe in Fairfax, maybe Marin Coffee Roasters or Fairfax coffee roasters.

"If you want to take them up on the Marshall Store idea (which is a great place), you could go Lucas Valley Rd, right onto Nicasio Valley Rd, pass through the town of Nicasio, drive along the reservoir, make a right onto Point Reyes - Petaluma Rd, 4 miles down the road after you pass the Cheese Factory take a left onto Hicks Valley Rd., left onto Marshall - Petaluma Rd which will dump you out onto Hwy 1 on the North end of Marshall.  Turn left and about a mile down the road on the bay side is the Marshall Store.

This will bring you through redwoods in Lucas Valley, past the Nicasio reservoir (not empty!!!), through a lot of open space and ranchland, and then the view of the bay and Point Reyes across is really nice as you crest the highest point of the Marshall - Petaluma Rd. and travel downhill towards Hwy 1.  It's longer than necessary, and quite windy, but a beautiful drive if you are trying to get to Marshall from Hwy 101.

"1 is great, a couple things to note: 

* Generally it won't be too foggy if it's raining, but if it is foggy it's not worth the drive, especially if you're a timid driver (can get sketchy out there in fog). 
* if it rains hard enough, and you're out early enough (e.g. dawn), there'll often be debris (rocks) on the road. Probably won't flood but some areas may have large puddles and the road is narrow. 
* there's a couple corners there that you can easily lose it when it's raining. Drive cautiously. 
* I see someone else already mentioned it but I'll repeat it. As a courtesy, if someone is behind you and no-one is in front of you, pull over at the soonest safe opportunity (they're almost certainly driving faster than you are if they come up behind you). Yes, even if it's just one car. (if there's multiple, when you pull over you let \_everyone\_ by, no pulling back in until it's clear) You can drive the speed you prefer and they can drive the speed they prefer. Everyone's happy.  
* Don't pass cyclists on blind corners (probably won't be any with the rain, so there's a bonus there).",t2_4kmow0hm,wolffartz,0,1647638990.0,0,t1_i17f0xc,i17f0xc,False,ScaryPay7746,t3_th7elg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marin/comments/th7elg/rainy_day_drives_in_marin/,Rainy day drives in Marin?,/r/Marin/comments/th7elg/rainy_day_drives_in_marin/i17f0xc/,4,r/Marin,0,4

">	Where should I visit?

(im going to answer in a new comment so people can chime in)

If you want old marin hippie culture, the last part of that still standing is in Fairfax, which other people in this thread have mentioned. If you go to the Wu Wei Tea Temple there, youll get a taste (and smell) of the hippies. I used to work at Mana Bowls up the road, which is a popular spot (has a 50/50 chance of being open on any given day)

The Sweetwater in Mill Valley is a venue that Bob Weir still plays at a lot and is a super old part of Marin culture, a lot of legends have been through there.

Larkspur has the best downtown imo, but I‚Äôm biased.

The Silver Peso in Larkspur and the 2am Club in Mill Valley are both going to have some seasoned marin-ites. Both are dive bars.

"It depends. Most kids REALLY care about the prestige of their school, so those who do not get into to Cal (UC Berkley), UCSB, USC, or UCLA will typically do 2 years at College of Marin (people call it ‚Äúcom‚Äù) and then transfer.

"1. White. Not any particular nationality, but just white.
2. Not really a lot of personality at all. Lots of old people or families with kids. I will say there are a lot of comments here about people picking up their kids in maserati's which isn't true. It's much less flashy. Many many people drive teslas, but very rich people wear khakis, golf outfits, basic boring right white people clothes. But it is not a flashy place. There are lots of 60's ranch houses that are $4M. 
3. Politically I would guess most residents are super conservative republicans with a few rich democrats thrown in for good measure. I'm not sure this has really evolved from the 60's. The most political you will see is that they tend to be the ones who host $20k per plate fundraisers for candidates.
4. There are no young people in town (past high school age)  
  

5. Downtown is a the elementary school, bike shop, 2 fancy restuarants, a hair salon, and a children's clothing shop. And the post office. There is no mail delivery in Ross so everyone comes down to Ross Common to pick up their mail.  
  

6. There is nothing to do in Ross other than stay home, so yes, people get out. THey either work in the city or they have already retired very wealthy in their 40's.

"Ok so I‚Äôve done some more research and in 1969, the median family income was $17,211 (or $133,052 in 2022 money), a bit more than the median income of all of Marin county at the time ($13,935 or $107,724). The median family income in 2019 was $244,500.

So, I think, based on this and another comment I saw, Ross used to be a lot more mixed, with more middle class families. I‚Äôm still looking into those other towns, and ultimately know I‚Äôm going to have to visit Marin County to really decide, but the fact that Ross seems to have been a more middle class working town with a good school fits what I‚Äôm looking for for the novel.

Marin is a weird blend of blue-collar types who have been there forever and the rich folks who sort of grew out of the Financial District commuters to SF. Weirdly, using the bus is a relatively common way to get to work in the city.

Ross is a wealthy enclave for business types.  There's a lot of old money there too.  Gavin Newson lives there.  The kids of the wealthy parents are usually nice rich kids.  They are liberal.  Most have to really screw up (drugs, dui's, etc.) for daddy to not help them out through college, and afterwards.  Gavin would probally be homeless if not for than caring family.  Yes--I went to school with the guy.  He screw up a lot, and the family, along with the Getty's were always there with lawyers, and business finances.

The police department is basically a security force for the wealthy residents.  You will get pulled over for no reason if you drive through Ross in an older car after 11 pm.  The wealthy residents like to drink their fancy drinks, but never get DUI's.  The cops know one call and their career as a cop in Ross is toast.  

There is a tiny part of Ross that's middle class.  They live near college of Marin usually.

"Don‚Äôt get this comment or why it‚Äôs upvoted. 

RSL is married to a Coastie. She‚Äôs not married to anyone connected to RBRA, state, etc. Satellite photos also show how much the junk ground tackle is destroying the bottom of the bay and the eelgrass beds.

The bay inventory of boats has been included in just about every RBRA meeting harbormaster report for years, including by the previous harbormaster BP, who was on the take and didn‚Äôt enforce anything. With the number of boats still remaining (~80-90?), the argument doesn‚Äôt even make sense ‚Äî they can‚Äôt both be lying about inventory and on a rampage taking boats. There wouldn‚Äôt be any boats left if there were always 100 and CH and JM cleared 100. 

And yachts with huge anchors aren‚Äôt anchoring in the same places because it‚Äôs too shallow there. They‚Äôre usually out past Sausalito Point.

And Sausalito withdrew from the RBRA years ago, so they‚Äôre not part of the eelgrass claims or harbormaster complaints you‚Äôre talking about here ‚Äî though it‚Äôs prob fair to say this is partly Sausalito‚Äôs doing, since the reason for withdrawal was that they wanted exactly this type of enforcement back when RBRA was trying to get a mooring field instead. 

100% agree what‚Äôs happening is inhumane and an absolute outrage. It‚Äôs like LA cops dropping every ‚Äúundesired‚Äù member of society on Skid Row and then driving away. RBRA‚Äôs taking people‚Äôs homes and leaving them to join tent encampments in Sausalito ‚Äî in the middle of a pandemic, when they were prob in the safest environment (separated from each other) to the worst (huddled en masse) ‚Äî with no solution to help them find housing or get support, and absolutely yes, Sausalito PD is then swooping in to bully and harass and even assault those out there, including media documenting what‚Äôs happening.

The moral of the story is Sausalito created a much bigger problem by being slick.  They brought this problem upon themselfs.

Oh yea, they hired a privateer (Some Harbor Master). to act as judge, and jury, and has been abusing his power.  (My hope is he, and the town, are sued.  Oh yea, the Coast Guard should check his blood alcohol level at around 2 pm.)

Most cities and  suburbs in America closed up easements like this a long time ago (Urban planners  mostly built these in in the 1950s and 60s.) These easements facilitate crime: home burglaries notably.  They  also serve as loitering sites for gangbangers, vagrants, and other chronic offenders.

"I have been researching replacing windows in my house for a couple years. I should mention that I've read most of the big window threads on Reddit and the info is often dated/maybe slightly biased or sometimes outright wrong. It is also really difficult to find numbers specifically for Marin. Anyhow, hopefully my research will benefit you.  

I have gotten bids from many of the firms focused exclusively on windows (e.g. AAA Windows for Less, Bay Area Window Factory, Save Energy Company). I have also worked directly with Golden State Lumber and some local contractors. 

I have around 27 windows in my home. Via the ""window installer"" firms, quotes for full replacement (I didn't always get bids for 100% of the windows, so there's a bit of guess-timation here) were in the 60k range. This is for ""retrofit"" windows -- that is, they keep the current windows in place but take out the glass and slide a sash over the current frames. You will ""lose a little glass"" in this process (i.e., the amount of visible space in your windows will get a little smaller). This was also for cheaper (but still fairly nice) Simonton windows -- in a basic white color. It probably could not be permitted because window sizing in some of my rooms is not large enough to meet egress requirements (and ""retrofit"" windows don't change the size of the opening). 

With the contractor route (admittedly, might be hard to find a contractor willing to install windows for you right now, and contractor bids vary _wildly_), I was looking at around 40 - 50k, BUT: with Milgard fiberglass windows, which allows me to get black windows, AND a fancy trifold patio door, AND with full frame replacement (they will take it down to the studs, so no loss of glass). That figure does _not_ include stucco repair (I'm doing a whole skim-coat on the house, so hard to break out the cost to repair just around windows), and the inevitable engineering that I need because I'm combining/enlarging windows. It does not include permit cost either. I expect my total to wind up around 85k - 90k, but this is going to include all the engineering costs, additional install costs for replacing a few headers, and a full skim-coat on the outside of my house. 

A similar install from the window firms for just windows would probably cost upwards of $100k. With the stucco/engineering, probably more like 150k - 200k -- if they would even do it. 

My wife was really pushing for ""someone who knows windows"" (e.g. a windows specialty firm) to do it, but I looked into window replacement/install and it's pretty basic. It's possible that people who install windows all day every day know some tricks about installation but I think that difference is going to come into ""speed of installation"", not ""quality of work"". The other thing you might lose by going the general contractor route is you might have more difficulty if you need to warranty a window. That said, I felt like the cost difference means I could just fully replace 3 - 4 windows if I needed to and still come out ahead. Lastly, window companies will come out literally tomorrow, measure everything, and probably get your job done in a month or less. I expect my window job (which I've been planning for years now) to _hopefully_ finish by next fall if I'm lucky (waiting on engineering right now). I'm also doing a ton of coordination to make it happen (well, not a _ton_, but I've probably poured 12 - 18 hours into research/bids/calls). 

The other thing that set me firmly against the window specialty firms is when I got more details on material costs (by getting a bid for just materials from Golden State). When I asked about adding color to the windows, Golden State said, ""ah, it's about 50% more"". When I asked the window companies, every single one said ""ah, also about 50% more"". However, those window companies were putting that 50% surcharge _on the total cost_. That is, I would pay 50% more in materials AND 50% more in labor. So black windows apparently cost 50% more to install. That was when I like ""oh really? yeah, y'all are scammers"". Also, with Golden State, I had the person say ""eh, if you're going to go black, you might as well upgrade to fiberglass windows, it will be about the same cost and they come in black as standard"".  

If you insist on going with a window firm (you want a more ""full service"" experience), I can recommend all of the ones I listed above. They seemed pretty nice, albeit a bit ""sale-sy"". I think I would give the slight edge to Window Factory, had the nicest experience with them and they had the best estimator (he was very nice, obviously knew his stuff, and made some really good suggestions). I'd recommend just getting some bids from local contractors. If you DM me I can share the info of my folks, but honestly I can't vouch for the quality of their window work (because they haven't installed my windows yet). I also don't know if they are available to do jobs any time soon, or if they are interested in doing a window job (I have them doing a bunch of other work, so it's possible that the window job is a ""favor"" to me).    

Re: window type, I think if you go vinyl (basically white windows), Simonton seems fine. I would've been pretty happy to install them if white windows were gonna look nice in our home -- however, we have a fairly modern looking house with original aluminum windows (nice looking but single-pane), and the white windows would've probably looked kind of janky. The Milgard fiberglass windows are clearly a step up, so I can definitely recommend those. 

Two things I would warn you away from is: 1) bids from Home Depot. I got one because it was easy I felt like it would give me a baseline price and it was a total waste of time -- most expensive bid I got plus the guy played some ""let me ask: are you ready to do this deal today?"" type sales games. I have also have heard horror stories about Home Depot installers (all subcontractors). 2) I would stay away from Andersen -- they seem like a window specialty firm with the ripoff dial turned to 11 (the windows themselves are supposed to be ok. Apparently tho the Renewal By Andersen windows -- the one the install firm would use, not the ones your contractor could get -- are cheaper, builder grade windows). Anyhow, good luck!

"First and last mile problems. 

 From most houses in Marin you're looking at a 20+ minute walk to get to the closest transit stop which mostly run along the major corridors.  Many of these residences are up skinny streets in the hills which makes the trip ever harder.

Compare this to a large gridded area like the East Bay or San Francisco where you can usually walk a couple blocks from the majority of residences to the closest transit.

It's the hills and valleys that preclude large gridded areas and efficient transit. 

I personally think that the first and last mile problem could be fixed with subsidized on demand shuttles.  It would also help if you could be guaranteed a spot on transit for your bike/ebike.  Right now the bike racks on the buses are first come first served so if you want to bring your bike to finish your commute, you take your chances and might have to wait for the next bus with a free spot.

"No. That‚Äôs not my solution. I actually 100% agree with you. However until our communities create the programs for these people ‚Äî- it is wrong to criminalize people who don‚Äôt have a home. 

Further, I‚Äôve actually worked with the homeless and while you are correct that the vast majority have mental illness and drug addiction there are a significant number who just don‚Äôt have a home. 

These people work in our community. They serve YOU and they can‚Äôt afford a home. 

I‚Äôve been out on the street at night in outreach programs and all over San Rafael you will find pockets of WORKERS camped in nooks and crannies just trying to get a night of sleep so they can go to work tomorrow in a job that most likely provides a service to people like you. 

When I did this work I was absolutely heartened by the team of young adults working with me who were absolutely respectful and dedicated to making sure as many people as possible were helped in the process. 

I also worked with the shelter program and I can tell you, without hesitation that almost all of those people had jobs and were not experiencing significant addiction or mental illness. Just once again they couldn‚Äôt afford the $7,000 to $10,000 price of entry to get a rental in this county. 

People do deserve to live in the communities where they work. There is nothing you can say that will justify criminalizing homelessness or dismissing the fact that people spend 90 minutes driving and pay a bridge toll to work at the grocery store for $18 an hour.

Finally, these services to help the mentally ill and addicted people in our community‚Ä¶ how do you expect to get these people off the street and into these programs to treat their mental illness if you do not allow housing to be built to shelter them?

We already have services that address this, but we may need more.  I also agree with London Breed that if they refuse those services, they need to be forced to accept.  We can‚Äôt continue to let people with addiction/mental illness take over our public spaces.

"Yes there are many paths to a destination and thanks a lot for your kind attitude. 

I of course feel that Marin is special and while I‚Äôm willing to change what it looks like, I‚Äôm not willing to sacrifice it for something with no plan. I know that it is difficult to come up with a plan but how many housing organizations and charities are here in the Bay? What exactly are they doing? Why has nobody even proposed anything? 

They seem to do nothing to solve the problem and instead shriek about gentrification. If they actually cared then there would be no homelessness.

 So for those reasons I am skeptical. Maybe if our government was Japan I‚Äôd be less hesitant, however I firmly believe in urban cores and walkable/bikeable neighborhoods, but building things left and right with no plan will only make things worse for everyone. If you‚Äôve noticed gridlock in building housing because people want answers, instead of complaining about selfish Marin people, is to put plans and accountability rather than units so that people know what they can do. That is more useful for the common man than random apartments here and there because then we could actually accomplish something. Ofc I still haven‚Äôt seen any that are fair and instead they want to build nothing in Oakland and everything in Marin. Oakland should be ground zero for redevelopment and anything on Bart and Caltrain should be next. And all cheap housing should be in an area where all of their needs can be accessed by bike instead of forcing them to buy a car.

"As if a small footprint apartment complex built on the site of an existing decaying structure is going to cause the ruination of everything. Those are the sites being considered.

"I agree with almost all of your points, for what it‚Äôs worth.  My main and only point of difference is a feeling of obligation to take steps to solve the problems.

My wife and I live in Tiburon and cherish the land, the quiet, the community.  That said, I don‚Äôt think all change is bad and building in density doesn‚Äôt have to mean Marin turns into Oakland.

"But the thing is that it will inevitably only benefit a few people unless there is a central plan on how many units are being built across the region as a whole. If not then the housing will go to a) some very few lucky people or b) someone rich enough to afford it. 

The Bay Area is one unit pretty much so there is no plan in place. How many units does this region need? There needs to be a proper analysis so we are not running around like headless chickens. 

Furthermore while I do agree that more apartments being built in Marin especially around the downtowns, there is no need to make it seem like people here are snobby and arrogant. It‚Äôs just that nobody wants to see the unique culture of Marin ruined for no reason because people didn‚Äôt plan properly. 

I encourage you to appreciate and enjoy the open space we‚Äôre so used to having, because it is extremely precious and we have taken a lot of hits just to have it. 

To be honest it seems that Marin shouldn‚Äôt be solving problems that other people caused. Since when is it Marins fault that all these tech companies opened in SF and SJ? Why is it that they get to refuse any kind of home building in their ALREADY built up areas while we are blamed for their problems? By not building housing as close as possible to jobs you are enabling the same kind of nonsense that has ruined pretty much every major city in America.

In my opinion every city in the state needs to be penalized based on the jobs they are making money from vs the housing they refuse to build. Perhaps tie income in as well so lower income areas can have more apartments and ergo housing affordability instead of begging the government for affordable housing. Marin is high income and low job so there is no need to live if you can‚Äôt afford it. Of course you can live 20 minutes away in Richmond for like 1/5th the price and still enjoy everything the county has to offer minus all the snobby bs. 

I think prop 13 also hurts because then a bunch of people will just never sell their land. 

Honestly if all of these topics are addressed then there will be housing affordability. But building housing here when there is
-no university
-no major corporations 
-no public transit and an extremely expensive geographic environment to build one
-nothing new that has been built in the last 40-50 years 

Is not actually fixing any problems, it‚Äôs just making existing problems much worse and trying to put band aids on things. The thing is that nobody talks about this.

"Sorry but I don‚Äôt find it logical that because I am against high density housing in Marin that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúracist‚Äù. I think you are the racist because you are assuming people of color are too stupid to game the system. 

 Yes it does hurt poor people, so it is classist. But so does forcing them to purchase a car and drive around Marin. So there is no logical reason to build affordable housing here when there are so many other candidates close by such as Richmond, SF or Santa Rosa. 

Furthermore I appreciate the people that come work in Marin and they should be paid higher wages to come here for work but nobody is forcing anyone to work here. They work here because they like it, and there are plenty of other opportunities in the Bay Area for them. In fact if they left then it would create worker scarcity and force wages to go upward. But despite the lack of affordability they still continue to work here because they are drawn to the area.  Furthermore because they are in demand they are able to command higher wages. That would not be a reality if there was suddenly thousands of other people competing for jobs. 

Idk what it is but the environmental crowd are incorrect in their push for car heavy development, but they are correct for insisting that more development will not do anything except benefit a few people. There will never be enough space here for the entire Bay Area and it‚Äôs futile to try. Furthermore the housing affordability crisis has not been Marin county‚Äôs fault, we do not get subsidies from the 1000s of tech companies here yet we are supposed to house their workforce or the spill off from their workforce.

"Our geography severely limits standard transit from operating efficiently.  Too many first and last mile hills, and dead end valleys.

The train is opposed for the very fact that it was never designed to reduce traffic.  There are very few commute time trains and their capacity is extremely limited due to the maximum length of trains and single tracking limits on frequency.

The train has failed at every promise that was made, and in fact is a net polluter due to empty off commute trips.  Even before the pandemic the subsidy per rider was well over a hundred bucks per day. 

No one is against the train because they hate efficient transit in Marin.  They hate the train because it is vastly more expensive and less efficient than almost any other option.  In fact I think it is the most expensive per passenger train in the nation.

"OK, here's some other thoughts: 

> There is basically no inventory right now around here or in Marin given the seasonality. I switched to Zillow sold and poked around a bit and the gaps were nuts. 

Generally kicks up in Feb, as you likely know, but a _lot_ of folks have been looking in Marin given the pandemic realities. 

> E.g. pretty basic 3/2 house posted as sold in 2021 near Terra Linda at $1.3m but Zillow estimate was $2m. 

This seems ""right"" in that (speculation ahead! :) ) Zillow probably over-relies on something like per sq ft price medians to guess-timate housing prices. This kind of thing is probably workable when you have relatively recently built-out subdivisions where things are largely in the same condition, but in Marin you've got ... totally unkempt shacks next to multi-million dollar new builds. I would guess that the house you're looking at which sold at 1.3 needs updating or something else to actually realize a 2M price.

 >There is a section on the map labeled Greenbrae that's probably the furthest south for us.

Ok, that's helpful to narrow things down, and a pretty good dividing line given your weather requirements. Greenbrae/Ross/Kentfield are extremely expensive and have great schools. Fairfax and San Anselmo also have great schools, are somewhat less expensive but still up there. Definitely worth spending time in the San Anselmo and Fairfax downtowns while you're here. As others have mentioned, the traffic to/from there is a mess, but since you are WFH maybe not a huge deal. San Anselmo can vary WIDELY in pricing, lots of very expensive homes and some cheaper ones. They both give me the impression of kind of the type of ""village-y"" towns that you would see in the South Bay, except less suburban and no proximate freeway. 

San Rafael has some very nice areas, some more ""urban"" living (like Gerstle Park), some more mountain-style (stuff off of Wolfe Grade), and some solidly suburban (Terra Linda, trivia: largest concentration of Eichler homes). I have heard the school district isn't all that great, which is what kept us away. That said, ""great"" in the Bay Area means 9/10 or 10/10 schools. When I looked back at the schools I attended in Sac, they all scored in the 6 - 7 range, but I have always felt pretty good about the public school education I got. San Rafael, especially Terra Linda, will regularly be about 10 - 15 degrees hotter than Mill Valley/Tam Valley in summer (which I think is what you want). 

North of there is Novato -- I don't know a lot about it, except that it has the Costco that serves basically all of Southern Marin. The downtown is nice, somewhat similar to San Rafael, maybe a little sleepier. There is a kind of interesting suburb called Black Point/Green Point that's off the 37 and looks pretty nice, might be worth looking into (I hear they get more fog than Novato proper). 

Past that you're in Sonoma. If you want to stretch your dollar for housing it's probably worth looking into Petaluma a little, very cute town that reminds me of midtown Sac in many ways. You might also check out Santa Rosa.

"cool, sounds like we're on the same page re: housing market realities. I have some other suggestions I can drop in then once I get a touch more time. 

re: that San Anselmo house, I would guess the Zillow estimate \_might\_ be accurate? San Anselmo is fairly desirable. The problems with that house tho are 1) directly on SFD (basically the main road everyone traverses) and 2) ""property needs work"" -- usually if they say something like that, it's ""serious"" work, not cosmetic. I'll be honest, I've never seen anyone put that on a listing before. I would ask for the disclosures (just to get a sense of how much work it needs) and then keep an eye on the selling point. =

"Oh, yeah, the same sort of thing is happening around here - low ball the posted ask, bidding wars, no contingencies, etc. We bought our both places like that, fortunately I am pretty comfortable with and expect to do a bunch of work/rework as needed.

Seattle and especially the east side (Bellevue, Kirkland) are (IMHO) turning into the bay area fast.

I have been aware of the limits of the Zillow estimates vs. more real comps for a while. Will confess to watching Zillow trying to get into home buying based on their algo and then totally f'ing it up with a certain amusement.

There is basically no inventory right now around here or in Marin given the seasonality. I switched to Zillow sold and poked around a bit and the gaps were nuts.

"Yeah, I hear you, we were in a similar boat re: family proximity. I focused in on Santa Cruz for a bit due to tech jobs (less relevant now) and surfing. Marin meets many of these same criteria (well, surfing not as good, but it is surfable), has better schools, and, well, not to be heartless, but has fewer ""big city"" annoyances (the homeless issues in SC are challenging). 

You might consider Pacifica, which is south of SF, I think it'll be a bit cheaper than SF proper. Schools are OK, but not as well regarded as Marin. 

If you can give up proximity to the coast (like, do an hour+ drive vs. 20 - 30 min) there might be spots around LA that work and are cheaper. 

There are places similar to Marin but less near beaches in the east bay: Orinda, Moraga. Walnut Creek is also not bad and a little cheaper. South Bay probably also worth a look but is going to be priced similarly to the more expensive parts of Marin. 

I would seriously look at Sonoma too, you're going to see cheaper housing but it feels similar. SF isn't that far from Santa Rosa, Petaluma, etc if you're not commuting. 

Kirkland median prices (1.1M) look like they're a little below Southern Marin median prices (starter homes -- small 3/2s -- in Mill Valley/Ross/Larkspur etc are generally running 1.5M+) but Novato is closer in (1.0-ish median). Novato pub schools look like they're a few notches below the Mill Valley area via Great School rankings.",t2_4kmow0hm,wolffartz,0,1642022135.0,0,t1_hsefndo,hsefndo,False,rootException,t3_s1nai5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marin/comments/s1nai5/thinking_of_moving_to_marin_thoughts/,"Thinking of moving to Marin, thoughts?",/r/Marin/comments/s1nai5/thinking_of_moving_to_marin_thoughts/hsefndo/,2,r/Marin,0,2

"Oh, yeah, the requirements process is nuts. Have family in CA, so don't want to move too far away - e.g. another country. Not super interested in moving away from the west coast for a variety of reasons.

So, once it's west coast + prefer a cool Mediterranean climate, list starts to shrink. I looked at Capitola/Santa Cruz and was surprised to find how relatively rural it was. People on the Santa Cruz sub were basically saying that the only hospital sucked and that we'd have to go to San Jose for a hospital.

Similarly, got feedback that Santa Barbara was pretty small/far from stuff.

"You might add some more requirements, especially cost-of-housing/living ones. If you are only looking for weather + good health care, why Marin?

There are probably many other places in the country that would meet your current list. 

Cooler summers than Seattle might be tough, looks like Seattle averages around 70, where a lot of Marin is at 80 (tried Novato, good stand-in for ""warmer"" Marin and Tam Valley, stand in for ""cooler"" marin). Still, the summers can be chilly -- especially in the evenings -- in Southern Marin.

"Marin, 

Lived here only 10 years. I love it. Loved it during Pandemic as everyone followed the rules and kept us mostly healthier than most of the country I read. 
Amazing hiking, sunsets, great schools. My 11 year old  goes to Hall Middle, great schools here. Summers can be foggy and cloudy. September and October are usually the warmer months I think. Lots of good people and they offer help if asked. The NEXTDOOR APP is so very useful and neighborly. Everyone in the places I‚Äôve lived have been good neighbors. I have found some good rentals for 2 bed because that‚Äôs all we need but decent pricing. The government sites say poverty level income for a single white male in Marin is $82,000.  Lots of people make money yet there‚Äôs also the ones ( I know) that live here comfortable making much less. Good doctors I think. Great health stores like The Goodearth, Whole Foods if you like them. Many other great grocery stores. Quick to the city and back for a Warriors game. Marin is great for bike riders. My. Tam is beautiful and Stinson beach is a popular destination on beach days.

"Actually i think the trial won‚Äòt go anywhere. There is a book by Kahnemann about Noise in Human judgement. Not only are we biased in our decisions nur also incredibly noisy. Look at judges, they got sort of the same education but how they sentence someone varies dramatically. An error of 50% is unfortunately not rare. Therefore it can be hard to discriminate between random noise, which essentially means inaccuracy in judgement, and bias which is the skewing decision in a particular direction.

"Lived here for the majority of my life. In my neighborhood the community is not particularly tight knit, but that could be in part because I live on a hill with spaced out houses. Fairfax is not particularly diverse, if you want a decent level of diversity in Marin you have to go to Novato or San Rafael, not West or South Marin. Housing prices are ridiculous, our valuation has increased by probably 70% in 12 years of living here. If you‚Äôre young and on a budget, do not move here. Prices all around are expensive- groceries, restaurants, gas. Also, Marin doesn‚Äôt really have a lot of jobs and a vast amount of the population has to commute to other parts of the Bay. The government is predictably left wing, although I believe our town council is the only majority independent in the country (so says Wikipedia, not sure what year they are referencing.) The town is focused on social justice initiatives and recently the council voted unanimously to rename the most prominent and longest road in Marin, despite mixed resident opinion. The population is very left and very democratic. I would guess that it‚Äôs easier to find someone that‚Äôs gay than Republican, and even harder to find someone willing to admit to being a Republican. One interesting thing is that there‚Äôs a ban on chain restaurants on the books. The only chain we have is 7-Eleven. No fast food chains whatsoever. 

Crime is low, although there is a particular emphasis on bike thefts. There was someone shot and killed while hiking a few years back and a car chase through the town at one point, but these incidents are few and far between. Traffic can be pretty annoying, as there are only two main routes to go from Fairfax to neighboring San Anselmo and only one road that spans the whole town. When people flock to the beaches on weekends, it becomes a nightmare. 

Overall, I have enjoyed my time here, although you have to appreciate a small town feel.

"If he's just a dude with an iPhone then why does it show in the footage that the police are walking off with his full size professional videography equipment? If he is not and never was a journalist how do you explain his 20 years of accredited photojournalism experience?

I saw the footage and I would not classify anything in it as ""resisting"" arrest. In one section you claim he is known to be aggressive and then follow that up by including an incident for which there is apparently no evidence, nor have charges been filed. This reads as transparent character assassination not news.

"well, ""ethnic"" might be debatable (given that most people mean ""not white people food"" when they say it), but I'll offer up that [Italian Deelite](https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-delite-novato-2) is the best bang for your buck I've found in Marin (get the fries). 

I've had some luck in San Raf around Bellam, with [Churro Station](https://www.yelp.com/biz/churro-station-san-rafael).  [Taqueria San Jose](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-san-jose-san-francisco) is frequently referenced, and OK in my book but not great (my gold standard here for ""cheap"" and ""good"" is El Burrito Express in the city, Taq San Jose is more like a Taq Cancun). I've also tried and thought reasonably well of [Picante](https://www.yelp.com/biz/picante-taqueria-san-rafael) and [El Torogoz](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-and-pupuseria-el-torogoz-larkspur) (the latter is in Larkspur and comes with a bit of a premium, so just on the edge of cheap, but it's good). 

I have not found any well priced banh mi's around, tried both [Banh Mi Zone](https://www.yelp.com/biz/banh-mi-zon-san-rafael-3) (near the convention center) and [Banh Mi & Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/banh-mi-and-coffee-san-rafael-3) and was underwhelmed by both -- in terms of price and quality (although I am comparing them to the banh mi I got in Oakland Chinatown circa 2008, so maybe my expectations around price are way out of line.)

Looking forward to what other folks have to share. It's hard to come by cheap eats around here (guessing because operating costs are insane).

"I would recommend Novato for several reasons. 1st: cost. In Novato, you get more for less, simple as that. For the price of a small one-story house in fairfax, one could get a 2-3 story mansion in black point-green point with a view across the bay, or a view of all of novato. 2nd: Traffic. Fairfax is located along sir francis drake, which has a lot of traffic sometimes. Novato is located along 101, which although also can have traffic, it is nothing compared to Drake. Something to consider, is that fairfax has better schools. Fairfax and Novato both feel small for different reasons. Fairfax is somewhat small (about 8000 people), and has a lot of houses tucked away in the hills, mixed with a cute downtown. Novato, although large (55,000 people) has an adorable downtown, reminiscent of a small town, with everything one needs. Living in fairfax, one might have to go out of town more often to get things. Also, Novato has much better public transit, including many bus lines, and the smart train. Fairfax only has around 2 bus lines, both to Sam Rafael. This brings me to my last point, weather. Novato is consistently warmer than south marin, and fairfax has fog issues. This is why I believe Novato is a better place to live, but it is all up to the individual.

"I‚Äôve lived in both cities, so answer your questions:

Fairfax:
There has been a recent flood of families from San Francisco and the East Bay buying homes in Fairfax. It is no longer the hippie town it once was, and is expensive and at times, pretentious. Community is what you make it, but definitely a closer knit town than most other ones in Marin. As with most cities in Marin, no reasonable amount of diversity in comparison to the rest of the Bay Area. Homeownership - people tend to be quite NIMBY. It‚Äôs difficult to get permits, and neighbors fight tooth and nail to prevent you from doing things like cutting down diseased trees. Probably one of the more frustrating towns in Marin to be a homeowner. Government - fine. Nothing special to write about. The police department usually only has 2 officers on duty at a time, so response times can be slow. There is very little crime whatsoever.  Of any city in Marin, Fairfax has the worst traffic. When I lived there, I honestly feared for the day when I‚Äôd have to evacuate due to wildfire and be stuck. 

Novato:
Novato is a completely different beast. It had a fairly close community for its size, lots of meetups, clubs, churches (if that‚Äôs your thing). Even less diverse than Fairfax - it‚Äôs effectively suburbia in many parts. Homeownership in Novato is a bit more reasonable. House prices are more affordable, neighbors tend to be more respectful, and the permitting department is strict. Novato prides itself on its Police and Fire Departments.

"Why aren't they charging the cops?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31XL-TFeyp0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31XL-TFeyp0)

Where is the journalist's statement?  I'd like to see what his statement is, not just the cops.  The video starts out with him being super polite and cooperative, and then he starts complaining that the cops are deliberately hurting him, and then he starts screaming that they're hurting him.  The cop is deliberately obstructing the camera.

""Officer injury""?

Then they intended to violate federal and state law and only didn't because his lawyer sent them a letter informing them about it.  Oh wait, no, they received the letter first, then moved forward to get the search warrant, the search warrant violating the law was granted, after receiving the letter.  Okay.  Then after they get a search warrant they \*claim\* they didn't review the footage they seized.  (Of note, they're not entitled to absolute immunity when acting as a complaining witness to get a search warrant.)

Yeah, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a really high standard.  Weird how the burden of proof in civil cases is only preponderance of the evidence, but to (try and fail to) get any ""justice"" for violations of your civil rights it takes a minimum of 3 years, with an attorney willing to make that up front investment.  County legal counsel makes $200k a year, plus $100k for an assistant, plus overhead.  To overcome preponderance.  I wonder how much money and time it costs the DA to charge someone when the burden is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

""\[H\]e noticed an officer following Portje. When the journalist set up his camera and began filming, the officer stood directly in front of the camera.""

""Both Jacob and Luis said that Georges, without provocation, grabbed Portje‚Äôs camera. ""

""In doing so, Georges appeared to accidentally hit himself in the chin or chest with the piece of equipment, according to Luis.""

"" ‚ÄúThe officer reacted to the camera hitting him,‚Äù Luis said. ‚ÄúHe started punching Jeremy.‚Äù ""

""Portje attempted to block the blows by placing his arms over his head. Georges then grabbed Portje‚Äôs arms and forced the journalist to his knees on the pavement, according to Luis.""

""The three charges against Portje include two felonies and a misdemeanor: obstructing an executive officer, battery on a police officer with injury and battery on a police officer""""Portje spent the night of Nov. 30 in jail and was released early the following morning on $15,000 bail""

Hm, so they violated his 4th amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure of the camera, then violated his 4th amendment right to be free from excessive force, assaulted him (a clearly established statutory state right), committed PC 149 / other crimes (which people have no protection under unless they belong to the VIP club), and then arrested him, violating his 4th amendment right to be free from unreasonable arrest, and caused him to lose $1500 in bail.  Oh yeah, and the 14th amendment right that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  They created a classification without a legitimate government interest when they establish and perpetuate a policy of deliberate indifference to crimes committed by police.  Oh, and they libeled him.  Oh and obstructing him from filming, that's a first amendment right.

And the County DA is okay with all that, and with the taxpayers having to cough up the money for damages (or more likely just paying the judges and the county legal counsel an extra 200k a year because hey the taxpayers have to fund the civil legal defense for the cops, and no damages to the victim, after a 3-5 year lawsuit, or the victim will just let it go like 99.9999% of victims of police crime do).

Good job, Lori?  Not maliciously prosecuting a journalist for getting beaten up by malicious cops.  Good decision.  She takes ""assaults on police"" very seriously, but the burden of proof is very high and there wasn't enough evidence to warrant spending money on criminal proceedings against the person who caused an officer to be assaulted by a camera after the officer ""without provocation, grabbed \[the\] camera"" without probable cause, and then assaulted, and falsely arrested, and attempted to maliciously prosecute the journalist. Sorry Marin County, we don't think we could get a jury verdict under proof beyond a doubt so won't be proceeding criminally against the journalist.  

But if the journalist decides to file a lawsuit to stand up for his rights within the 6 month statute of limitations, the DA has 1 year to decide to change their mind about the criminal proceedings.

"You have this all wrong.

I'm not the one raining on the parade. I would love to legally shoot pellet guns in the Marin hills. I'd love it if kids were allowed to play airsoft or ride motorized bikes up there. But Marin County bureaucrats have a hard-on for busting people doing stuff like this in the hills. And when I spoke to the rangers, they told me they actively patrolled and busted people for all that stuff.

I support everything you just said (especially the not using poison or traps - makes sense).

Just watch out for people who might see you using a pellet gun out there.
