"I don't think it has anything to do with where people are from. Animosity is high writ large.  Everyone is stressed to almost breaking.

There's the oft discussed issues with our capital E environment, but there's also a lot of issues with our little e environments.  It's too loud, lonely, hungry, full, empty, constricted, detached... whatever it is for that person.  As beings of intellect, we like to think that we have surmounted nature.  We deny the expression of natural law.  We decry the animalistic behavior of other humans specifically as form of denial of our own animal nature.

"In addition to what others have brought up, Bozeman is a college town; which will almost always increase the size of the local law enforcement. 

There are numerous other factors that could affect it, including; a significant amount of Meth in the region, a major interstate highway with lots of through traffic, and a pro police community that will encourage increased numbers of law enforcement (whether it's needed or not). Historically, MT in general also has (to my understanding) more DUI's than most other states and was also called out by groups like the southern poverty law center as having high rates of hate crime (highest per Capita in the country, is what I've heard said)

Also, now that weed is legal for recreational use, they spend way less time harassing pot heads these days, so they have to find stuff to do.

"Sigh. Bring on the down votes. üôÉ

This constant ""native Montanan"" vs outsider hate is extremely tiring. I understand it, I truly do, I've been tethered to this area for 20+ years. I've seen the changes, some good, some not, but things change everywhere all of the time.  Nothing in life is static. Honestly I think life would be a tad bit boring if that were the case. One either adapts with the changes or they don't. However this sort of purposefully hateful unfriendliness only breeds more unfriendliness imho. Pretty soon, we're a whole community of selfish and miserable c*nts. 

This is the only state I've been where people care about where you're from so they can hate on you for ""reasons"". I was recently back in Indiana last summer visiting family and we went to the county fair. No one had ever seen a Montana license plate, so I got the funniest questions from people after being seen parking out in the field, ""Do you see Indians all of the time?"" ""Do people ride horses everywhere?"" ""Are there Walmarts there?"" People were curious, interested to learn, and genuinely surprised that we had a Costco out here. 

So, I may be from rural Indiana, but I promise I'm not trying to change things here. I can't personally change anything on a community level anyway. I'm as friendly as anyone else most days. I might be a quiet introvert, but get me on the right topic and I'll happily chat your ear off. I'll bend over backwards to help if you need it. And I hate not touching base and possibly leaving anyone hanging. It's rude. 

This state is where my spouse was born, this city is where my spouse is from and went to school, this city is where his whole family lives and owns businesses, this city is where he found a meaningful job that he truly enjoys working for a long-time local company that treats him well. We're just trying to live in peace here, raise our kid where we have our whole family all together, where she has vastly more education opportunities than where we lived previously, all while trying to have a halfway enjoyable life while still not being able to afford a house...*just like everyone else*. ;) 

All of that said, the rudeness definitely goes both ways here. Some locally owned businesses and native Montanans aren't as saintly as you make them out to be.

Back in the Midwest, if I called an electrician, a plumber, or most recently an auto body shop...they generally answered their phone. If they didn't and you had to leave a message, they would call you back later in the day and touch base on whether they could work you into the schedule or not. That's called common courtesy. 

Here? Static. Absolutely nothing. If you're too busy to take on new work, at least change your phone message to address that you can't take any more work until next month or whatever, so that we know when we call we need to look elsewhere. 

This past Monday morning I called umpteen area auto body shops, trying to get my truck in so I can at least drive the fucking thing until they have time to fully repair it. The only one who actually answered the phone was Ressler, and they're booked out until late June. It's now Thursday afternoon and not a single one of the other shops that I left messages with has even bothered to call me back to say they're covered up. It's maddening. At this rate we'll be getting it road worthy ourselves in the driveway. 

About downtown, admittedly I'm probably wearing RBF (resting bitch face) when I go downtown. I'm annoyed about parking, loud traffic, the tiny penis crowd with the rolling coal trucks, my overly enthusiastic child wants to go in every store, and I have to make her and me sad because can't afford to buy anything downtown. Honestly, that's what makes me sad, what's to smile about downtown in that case. So maybe that's the case with others, too. 

And lastly, I go on hikes to enjoy the solitude and scenery that Montana prides itself on, to get away from all of the talking people typically clogging the trails around town, to not hear music blaring from trails around town, to escape the 24/7 barking dogs and dog shit, to go where there's no traffic, to hear the sounds of nature. I shouldn't be shamed for benignly ignoring your existence on a trail miles from civilization because I don't desire to have a conversation. You might get a smile, you might get a ""hello"", but that's it. I'm sorry that I'm not interested in having a conversation with strangers on my day off when I spent my whole week talking to strangers.",t2_w4k75,Neeraja_Kalrapindhi,0,1648163735.0,0,t1_i1zv62t,i1zv62t,True,AmazinFBA,t3_tmod0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/tmod0f/outofstater_ghosting/,Out-of-stater Ghosting,/r/Bozeman/comments/tmod0f/outofstater_ghosting/i1zv62t/,3,r/Bozeman,0,3

"Honestly, the ""us vs them"" isn't doing anything productive.

If you want people to be welcoming to you, be welcoming to them even if you don't like how their treating you in return.

A lot of the places you're calling out have the ""I'm busy and need to get on with things"" vibe. They learned it from being in places where the unending sea of humanity has dulled their senses for making connections with others. (If you are in a several million strong city you don't have the time to say hello to every person you meet.) You're going to have to work people out of that lifestyle if you want them to act differently and let's be honest, a lot of them are coming here because they WANT that small(er) town vibe but change doesn't happen overnight.

"I‚Äôm tired so I‚Äôm going to keep it brief;


Materials are ~generally~ cheaper when bought in bulk, 

To an extent, land is cheaper to buy in larger parcels than smaller ones,

Labor will be ~generally~ cheaper because instead of offering contractors, architects, etc a one off job, you can offer them several,

Loan terms should be more favorable due to increased down payment + all the income from the parties involved making it lower risk,

One off fees would be substantially mitigated; eg, running electricity + city water/sewage (if it went that route) to homes, etc

Because the community would be managing itself directly via a democratic process, fees have the potential to be less/used more efficiently,

tl;dr - 

If you have 20 people able to put $50,000 down and making about $75,000 a year; that means you have a million for a down payment and an income of $1.5 million.  You save money because, in ‚ÄòMurika, single units are often more expensive than bulk orders.",t2_eetnhpj4,Couch_Cheetos,0,1648127933.0,0,t1_i1xdql7,i1xdql7,False,jillberticus42,t3_tld73k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/tld73k/anyone_want_to_start_a_hippie_commune_in_the_area/,Anyone want to start a hippie commune in the area?,/r/Bozeman/comments/tld73k/anyone_want_to_start_a_hippie_commune_in_the_area/i1xdql7/,3,r/Bozeman,0,3

"I know someone else mentioned starting a sub just for this or maybe something on the sidebar.  I had a bad experience at Silverleaf out near Four Corners today.  First time buying recreational in MT so I was caught off guard by the cash only, but it makes sense.  I asked in very clear terms if price was relative to weight/content of product or if it was relative to THC content per package.  Retailer couldn't really grasp that concept.  She told me the 50mg pack was $7 so I said ok.  Got to the register and she rang it up and I wasn't paying close attention that it was $10 PLUS $3.50 to use my debit card.  She had not mentioned cash only at this point NOR did she mention that there was a processing fee.  Not wanting to make a fuss I just paid the fee and left.  It wasnt til I was a ways out of the parking lot that I remembered she told me $7.  I turned around and went back in and inquired as to why I was charged $10 and was told because of tax.  I knew that there was tax but that is absurd.  I asked her what the percentage was and she then told me 20%.  I quick bit of math told me that it would come to $8.40.  She then told me should would just give a dollar in cash and everything was fine, I told her that still is not the right amount.  So the tossed $2 at me and tried to hustle me out of the store as there were other patrons in at the time.

"What is your budget and what size & breed are the dogs?

Rental housing in general is scarce and expensive right now in the whole Gallatin Valley area, and I know people without pets who have been looking for months for housing with no success.  Pet-friendly rentals are even harder to find, and especially if your dogs are large and/or commonly prohibited breeds. Rentals that become available are snapped up very quickly, and your chances of getting one when you aren't physically here are fairly small. 

If you're looking for a roommate situation, your search will be further hampered by the fact that people in pet-friendly rentals that might be looking for roommates usually already have a dog or two, and Bozeman and Belgrade both have a two-dog limit (Bozeman is per household, Belgrade is per city lot).

Secondly, that's their mission: (from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwill_Industries) )

""In 1902, the Reverend¬†[Edgar J. Helms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_J._Helms)¬†of¬†[Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgan_(minister\))¬†[Methodist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist)¬†Chapel in¬†[Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston)¬†started Goodwill as part of his¬†[ministry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_ministry).¬†Helms and his congregation collected used household goods and clothing being discarded in wealthier areas of the city, then trained and hired the unemployed or impoverished to mend and repair them. The products were then redistributed to those in need or were given to the needy people who helped repair them.

Today, Goodwill has become an international nonprofit organization that takes in more than $4.8 billion in annual revenue and provides more than 300,000 people with job training and community services each year.

The revenues fund job training and other services to prepare people for job success.

"You neglected fair elections.

FYI:

Gov. Abbott reduced the ballot drop-off locations from 11 here in Harris county to one per country statewide I challenge all to look at the geographical size of each Texas county. Now, consider those with and without public transportation. Harris has no bus service to Katy for example.

Here in Houston, 4th largest US city by pop. Rep. (R-Tx) D. Crenshaw claimed the Democrats controlled the Harris County Election Board. That implies the D's can do what they want.

False.

I bet Rep. Crenshaw knew he was mischaracterizing the truth (ala Trump), Maher did not so it went unchallenged, GOP members (2) voted against it forcing people to use only those machiners set aside for their declared party. We voters were forced to form two lines, one for each party. I thought voting was supposed to be secret.

This tactic forced people to use only those machines set aside for their voter registration declared party affiliation. This is why some waited for 6 hours to vote. It was a primary election and the GOP prevented any challengers to Trump. The D's had choices.

ETA from the OP: 

UPDATE:

Just wanted to add some context because my post has gained some attention. As some people have pointed out, you can't make out what he's saying in the video. It wasn't my intention to create a propaganda hit piece. I just wanted to show the interaction as it happened.

I wasn't directly involved in the situation and I don't work for the company involved. Just happened to be in the area when it happened. I did overhear bits and pieces of the conversation and got much of the rest of the conversation from others.

It's not an uncommon scene at the airport. An entitled ""Karen"" misses their flight and demands special treatment. They deny any wrongdoing of their own and somehow come to the conclusion that it's the airline's fault that they missed their flight. Often a verbal argument then ensues and if the passenger starts making a scene, sometimes law enforcement will come and help defuse the situation.

From my understanding, that's exactly what happened here. As I said, it's not an uncommon scene. What is uncommon and unacceptable is when this behavior is displayed by an elected official. His constituents whom he represents, I'm sure, would not be impressed.

I've seen this situation play out a hundred times with other passengers. The airline employees handled Cruz with the same high level of professionalism and respect any other passenger would receive. He wasn't given any special treatment (positively or negatively). I commend the staff for staying cool in the moment and for not giving him special treatment.

Perhaps my phrasing with ""accosting"" was a bit hyperbolic. I don't think he was directly verbally abusing airline staff. More just being an entitled prick. He did however make thinly veiled threats towards the employment of the people involved. Demanding their names and threatening to call corporate. Presumably to flex his political weight to punish the employees involved and/or receive special treatment.

Hope this helps shed some light on the situation.",t2_7gdibzij,KenComesInABox,0,1647895936.0,0,t1_i1ktw0b,i1ktw0b,True,disleksiaRools,t3_tirgtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/tirgtl/ted_cruz_accosting_airline_employees_today_at_bzn/,Ted Cruz accosting airline employees today at BZN after missing his flight.
