"I have Tammy’s original comment saved and reproduced below.   


>  
What I'm about to say has absolutely nothing to do with politics or policy, she can defend her own policy positions, as I can on my own positions. But I will speak out wholeheartedly on this particular matter as someone who I have known for several years. The video seems very highly edited to me. I honestly cannot make out what he actually said, but I know that Farrah would NEVER say what this deep fake video is trying to convey, especially in the context of genocide.    
First of all, she has NEVER spoken ill of any group - nor would she ever. She is tolerant and accepting of ALL people regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual preference, gender/non-gender, economic status. She has stood in solidarity with all communities and views each person she encounters on their individual merits. As a Pakistani Muslim woman, she has been the victim of so much vitriol from so many sides.    
Secondly, I have never known her to be a genocide denier. As a matter of fact, it was Farrah who introduced a resolution at our April 13, 2021 meeting that was passed unanimously proclaiming April 24, 2021, as “Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day” and she will be reintroducing it again at our next city council meeting along with a community presentation.    
Thirdly, as an elected official, she is invited to many events and gatherings hosted by various cultural groups, consulates, foreign dignitaries, business leaders, etc - even more so given the uniquely wonderful diverse city Irvine is. We do our best to be gracious to everyone. Speaking for myself, while I try my best, I admit that it is hard to be thoroughly knowledgeable and well-versed on every current and historical dynamic that exists across the globe. If there were any mistakes made - it was that, a mistake. In that case, it would be best to educate rather than attack.    
Thirdly, many of the events she has attended were also attended by other mainstream (aka white) politicians. However, her enemies have chosen to focus only on her, and her alone. If she were a white man, would she face the same vitriol? I think not.    
If these people have a political issue with her, then they should argue with her on the merits of her policy decisions - not by making deep fake videos and passing them off as real.",t2_mzyoq1y,marxling,0,1648278154.0,0,t1_i260t7k,i260t7k,False,bush-,t3_tkujtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/irvine/comments/tkujtf/irvine_mayor_farrah_n_khan_makes_joke_with/,"Irvine Mayor Farrah N.

"The Mayor’s initial response to this has been wanting.

She started off:

1) Failing to acknowledge that her association with  genocide-denier Kirlikovali is problematic.

2) Blaming the prevailing interpretation of Kirlikovali’s comment on mistranslation, even though the entirety of the conversation is in English.

3) Failing to account for reports that she had appointed Kirlikovali to an advisory group.

"For vegans, it seems like it's got a lot more vegan food products than Sprouts, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. I'm seeing brands there that I don't see at the other stores. They even have plant-based spicy tuna sushi roll made with Good Catch vegan ""tuna"" in their sushi section, something you don't even see in Whole Foods. I'm not even vegan but a vegetarian (eggs only, no dairy due to lactose intolerance) but Bristol Farms makes it easy to do all my plant-based shopping in one place. Their produce section is more expensive than what you can get at your regular grocery store or ethnic grocery store, but insanely neatly organized; I don't think I've ever seen any grocery stores arrange fruits and vegetables the way they do. 

As a short 5'0"" woman, however, I really dislike how all their products are behind lever-like things (sorry I don't know what they're actually called) that push the second item to the front when you take the first one off the shelf, because when I'm trying to reach something on the top shelf, that lever thing is in the way and I have to struggle to take the product out past the lever thing.

"So far I’ve tried out the seafood stall, the deli, and some desserts. 

I’d avoid that seafood place; got the crab cake, fish taco and the shrimp mac n’ cheese. Crab cake was overpriced, overcooked, and over garnished: just bad. The fish taco needed a sauce or lime to tie it all together. The shrimp mac was awful. Frozen dinner like pasta and the cheese or sauce was sweet for some reason. 

The deli shop looked pretty good and I tried out their bbq sandwich, the kitchen sink. I’d say it was okay, pretty dry and overpriced (there’s a theme brewing here). My partner got the pulled pork sandwich and said it was pretty solid. 

The salted caramel bundt cake was extremely dense and overly sweet; would not get again. The cupcakes were also dense with the icing also being pretty stale. The cookies are enticing with how they’re displayed, but felt like it was lacking overall… and overpriced. 

The hot chicken sandwich stall and maybe a different sandwich from the deli might be my last hope with this place. There were a few obnoxious customers there when I first went, but seemed to calm down over the week. 

In the end, might be a place where I just grab some groceries since the produce has been pretty good to start off.",t2_5cxqtno8,jdy12,0,1648180361.0,0,t1_i20vd7p,i20vd7p,True,Ilikeoolongmilktea,t3_tnc99p,https://www.reddit.com/r/irvine/comments/tnc99p/bristol_farms_newfound_market_opened_in_irvine/,Bristol Farms Newfound Market opened in Irvine Spectrum,/r/irvine/comments/tnc99p/bristol_farms_newfound_market_opened_in_irvine/i20vd7p/,9,r/irvine,0,9

"Honestly, I completely understand how this would work, but I’ve got to be frank here—I’m one of the few black women who live here (maybe I’ve seen 2 others walking around), so I can’t go out of my way to do things like that. 

I’m sure I’m going to get downvoted into oblivion for “making it about race”, but that’s the reality for me. The leasing office made sure to let me know they “don’t want to cause panic amongst the residents”, and I’m not sure how many people would take kindly to me showing up to their door with a problem that has nothing to do with them.

Most of the neighbors are cool, and they have already read the note. But there are many who get very visibly uncomfortable when they just see me walking by.

"Nothing in the video was edited. It was taken directly from the organizers of the meeting and was published in Turkish media. Original source from Turkish media: https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7xh3aw

Ergun Kirlikovali's racist views have been known for **decades**. They are a part of his political identity because he has dedicated literally decades of his life and career to denying the Armenian Genocide and spreading hate against Armenians in California. He is not a stranger to Farrah N. Khan since she's had a working relationship with him for years and she appointed him onto Irvine's Mayoral committee. Not only should she not be collaborating with someone like him, she shouldn't even be joking about Armenians with somebody like him who's so openly anti-Armenian. Kirlikovali has since clarified on Twitter his joke was referencing claims of the Armenian Genocide disappearing, to which Khan responded she'll make sure to eat the Turkish sweets in front of Armenians. 

>First of all, she has NEVER spoken ill of any group - nor would she ever. She is tolerant and accepting of ALL people regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion.

What exactly does this mean? She has claimed (allegedly without being paid) that Azerbaijan is a ""secular democracy"" where people of different cultures and religions live side by side and the U.S. falls short in this regard compared to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is in fact ranked as less democratic than Iran, Myanmar and Turkey. It's a country where ethnic minorities are frequently suppressed and the Azerbaijani government encourages and rewards its citizens for murdering Armenians in Europe (see the [Ramil Safarov case)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramil_Safarov). While the meeting in question took place, Azerbaijan had been routinely [beheading elderly Armenian civilians](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/15/two-men-beheaded-in-videos-from-nagorno-karabakh-war-identified).

Every politician claims they're tolerant and accepting of different races and religions, but not all politicians show it. Farrah N. Khan therefore needs to explain her relationship with known Turkish Neo-Nazis and why she's joking about denying the Armenian Genocide with them. This cannot be brushed off as a ""fake video"" when the people in the video uploaded it onto the internet themselves.",t2_rk6i6,bush-,1,1648071224.0,0,t1_i1umlbi,i1umlbi,False,bush-,t3_tkujtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/irvine/comments/tkujtf/irvine_mayor_farrah_n_khan_makes_joke_with/,"Irvine Mayor Farrah N.

The position of Ergun Kirlikovali (and other Turkish nationalists) is that the massacres and deportation of Armenians was justified and necessary, but these massacres/deportations that killed 75% of the Armenian population do not constitute genocide. He's then spent decades of his life in California protesting against Armenian Genocide memorials and talks.

"In case anyone else is as confused as I was trying to make sense of their broken English:

""In our culture we don't congratulate or celebrate anything without sweets"" - middle Turkish woman

""Armenian's occasions, if you see them before this because you could eat it and it (they?) will disappear"" - Turkish man Ergun Kirlikovali

""I'll make sure to eat it in front of them"" - Mayor Farrah N. Khan

The guy is implying Armenians don't like the candy because it has Turkish origin; if an Armenian sees the candy, they go away. So he's making fun of Armenians' dislike of products of Turkish origin due to their genocide denial.

The mayor seems happy with the suggested consequence (i.e. making Armenians go away). It's possible it was just an in-the-moment comment without realizing what she was saying. Like how you instinctively smile when you think someone's telling a joke, then you realize it wasn't a joke and you feel stupid for smiling. But equally possible she's just as racist as the the Turkish man.

Took me a few re-watches to understand what they meant.

"Ok, Taiwanese American here.  For the record, I have no Turkish friends or Armenian friends (haven’t had a chance to make any friends of these cultures yet, but I’d love to.), and I despise racism in any form, for obvious reasons.  

From what I **think** I heard (noisy room), the guy seemed to be saying that Armenians love those sweets so much, that if they were at the meeting, the sweets will disappear.  In response, Khan said she’ll make sure she eats it in front of them *(to show off herself enjoying those sweets?)*

My view is that the guy made a culturally insensitive joke about Armenians, and it’s wrong.  It’s like saying: “if Asians are at this meeting, they’ll love these rice dishes so much they’ll finish it all in 5 min.”

But from what I heard, he didn’t seem to suggest making Armenians “disappear”.

"I agree that all 4 articles being from a single source introduces lots of potential for bias. The Voice of OC article (which I trust) also reports further on some of the concerns. As I was typing up my comment, I did a [search on the Voice of OC website](https://voiceofoc.org/?s=power%20authority) and saw a lot more results.

My takeaway is that CCE/CCAs were not popular to begin with, for whatever reason. On this subreddit and on Nextdoor, people were posting left and right about the doom and gloom around this. Farrah Khan and Mike Carroll picked someone who has been controversial.

[Last October](https://voiceofoc.org/2021/10/san-clemente-rejects-oc-power-authority-seeks-another-electric-utility/), San Clemente voted to reject OCPA:

>  Since it first started earlier this year, the OC Power Authority has been caught in a variety of public stumbles, including a delayed banking contract, complaints about transparency and the resignation of Lake Forest, which hopped off the ride before the agency got on its feet. 

> “I have no interest in going north and dealing with that Irvine crap,” said Councilman Gene James

And [a lot of transparency concerns](https://voiceofoc.org/2021/11/oc-supervisors-look-to-join-embattled-clean-power-agency-amid-transparency-complaints/) as well.

"HardenTraded's comments are way better researched and presented than mine but that doesn't make them more objective.  He is 100% correct on this.  The Agran ""Ethical Lines"" article was half hearted at best, missed half a million dollars of loans between the LLC and Agran, and missed the fact that the ""newspaper"" and the campaign have all of the same people, led by his daughter-in-law.  


Why attack Irvine Watchdog?  Because people in Irvine need to know who they really are.  Irvine DOES NOT need more of them.  Self-appointed Watchdog's who don't understand the process and don't call balls and strikes, but rather write one sided attacks against the Council DOES NOT actually improve the political process (contrary to the belief of those who love to hear themselves talk).  Case in point, Susan Sayre believes that her pre-written speeches at Council meetings matter.  The Council and Staff have learned over time that her comments are completely off base and have learned to ignore her.  That ultimately ""dulls"" the importance of community feedback to the Council because they grow tired of the same nonsensical diatribes so they become LESS focused on public input.  Watchdog and people like Simple Caregiver 575 are under the mistaken belief that they are having an impact on the process.  


Much self-congratulation was given when the sunshine ordinance changes ""went away"" months ago and they all celebrated their ""impact.""  Now it is back.  It literally had nothing to do with them, but they need something to justify the time they spend writing hit pieces that have no impact.

One of Agran's CEA's is Michaela Gonzalez Montaner.  Here is her twitter profile showing that she does fundraising and campaign work (which she also did for Fox).  She also has done production and writing for ICNV (which I have proof of, but not the time to post right now).  I am not saying there is anything wrong with this, it is totally normal.  What I am saying is this is another example of selective writing by Branda Lin and the Watchdog which ignores what Larry Agran does.

Harvey Liss - ""Editor of Senior Life.""  Former appointee to Planning Commission.  Head of many of Agran's campaigns.  


Kev Abazajian - ""writer.""  Appointed by Agran to the Green Ribbon Committee.  Head of DGI and a major campaign worker for Agran and his causes.  


Joel Smith - ""writer"" for sports and food.  Appointee to the Irvine Sports Committee.  Works on Agran's Campaigns and sometime for the Democrat party.  


Greta Jacobs - Logistics.  Appointee of Agran to Senior Citizen's Council.  Campaign worker.  


Gail Lewis, Ira Lewis, Alan Meyerson, and Sharona Toranto are listed on the masthead under ""Logistics & Distribution"" yet all regularly speak at the Irvine City Council meetings without disclosing that they have jobs with ICNV.

"I'm not sure who you think I am, but I don't obsess over Branda or IWD. Unlike you, I don't pop out of the woodwork every few days or so posting specifically about Irvine. I browse reddit daily and /r/irvine is a subreddit I am not only subscribed to, but also frequently comment on.

You seem oddly defensive, so perhaps your ability to think critically is a bit clouded.

When IWD posted the first of this series [in late January](https://irvinewatchdog.org/2022/01/30/new-series-ethical-lines-blurred-or-crossed-the-story-of-misappropriated-tax-dollars-by-councilmember-mike-carroll/), the title literally included ""NEW SERIES"". I read it and was interested in it. I don't agree with each post, but I followed along with the ""NEW SERIES"" - with capital letters.

Anyone who can recognize basic patterns could see that this series wasn't going to be a daily or weekly thing; it would be a few weeks between each post. Which meant I didn't expect to see quick turnaround on these ""Blurred Lines"" posts.

I'm not a fan of Larry Agran so when I saw this yesterday, I took a look.

Oh, and before you accuse me of being associated with some group, I am 100% not and have [my own gripes with the current city council](https://www.reddit.com/r/irvine/comments/tgl0zz/darkness_in_the_afternoon_city_council_poised_to/i14gqeb/). I really don't have anything to prove to you and don't care if you believe me or not, but you are free to browse through my comment history and make your own decisions. There have been several times I've even directly engaged with /u/TammyKimIrvine on [this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/irvine/comments/sbq1jg/irvine_city_council_to_explore_botanical_garden/hu1md2j/). I particularly took issue with the sunshine ordinance stuff a few months ago and [asked Tammy Kim about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/irvine/comments/qfys4e/councilmembers_tammy_kim_and_mike_carroll_seek_to/hi2vfku/).

Back to my point. I followed along with the series and using basic thinking, saw that it was an infrequent series. ICNV has been a point of controversy for Larry Agran, and of course I took a look. There were some good points made and I took it at that.

But then to see another post come out today, maybe just over 24 hours after the Larry Agran one, seemed out of the norm. All of the previous posts were infrequent as I'm sure it took a lot of time to do the proper digging. Interesting to see how quickly another one was pushed out. Are we going to see another one tomorrow? Who knows.

Again, I'm not associated with any group or candidate. You're free to believe what you want.

Quick edit: regarding the days between posts, let's do some more critical thinking here. For the reasons above, I knew no other posts in this series came out one day after the previous one was posted. Out of curiosity, I wondered how far apart each post was because 1 day was certainly the exception, not the norm, for reasons above.

If you go to the Irvine Watchdog website and hover over Articles and click All, you get taken to [this page](https://irvinewatchdog.org/articles/) which shows all of their articles. There are six articles on each page. All of the articles in this series are clearly indicated with the ""Ethical Lines Blurred or Crossed?"" prefix. The first post in the series was on page 3 of the ""all articles"" page. From there I used a website to find how many days those were posted apart.

"Branda Lin ""misleading?"" No!  That would never happen!  Branda is equal parts completely unsophisticated and totally biased against the four Councilmembers other than Agran because she desperately wants to be in the ""in crowd"" and can't get elected or keep an appointment.

"Another ""hard hitting"" Branda Lin expose.  Her half-hearted ""investigation"" of Agran's fake newspaper had barely been up long enough to see how few things she pointed out when she posted this one (She missed half a million dollars of loans between Agran and the ""newspaper"" in the Measure B election, but who thought she would do a real job on that one anyway?)  


So, back to the ""ethical violation"" of hiring someone who also works for a campaign...either Branda Lin is truly just writing these things to malign the Council or she has no idea how things really work (probably both).  MOST City Councilmembers have staffers who work for the City as well as for their campaigns.  Agran has done it for DECADES.  Lin missed the fact that many ""employees"" of the Irvine Community News & Views also work for the City OR are appointed officials at the City.  


The point of disclosure documents is to ""disclose.""  If Khan's assistant hadn't ""disclosed"" properly, Lin wouldn't have anything to write about (because she is little more than a woman with too much free time and access to google).  Too many of these Branda Lin posts are nothing more than posting publicly available documents for her other unsophisticated Watchdog friends to ""clutch their pearls"" and accuse ""developers"" of bad deeds.  A truly unbiased publication would look at the other Council Executive Assistants and discuss whether they also did the same things.

"Girl we are almost the same person! I still haven’t found much around Irvine, so here’s some suggestions based off places I’ve explored with my fiancé. 

Yes to Hive and Honey! It’s a rooftop bar and restaurant. So cool to sit up there at night and order cocktails. 

Javier’s is also good, but this is a sit down dinner place and may not be exactly your vibe. However, they have great ambiance inside and I love it anyway because the food and drinks are tasty. 

Habana in Costa Mesa is sooooo cute and it’s at the Lab/the Camp so you have tons of other places around. Parking is the biggest bitch of all here. 

It’s a bit of a drive, but I like Reunion Kitchen in Anaheim Hills. They have a nice outdoor patio (I think with heat lamps?) and a spacious interior with a bar. 

There are lots of places around the Orange Circle like the Wall, Bosscat, Paul’s (super divey) and the District (less divey but right next to Paul’s). Paul’s & the district will be more packed with college kids due to Chapman being right next door. 

One of my all time favorites though is the Blind Rabbit at the Anaheim Packing District. Cute “hidden” speakeasy.  Reservations should still be required (also, parking can suck over there) and they have a 90 min table limit. It’s a very small place. I think that would be right up your alley! Plus the packing district has tons of other food/drink options inside, so you have lots to choose from.

"- There would no longer be separate public comment periods for individual agenda items. Instead, there would be a single period for all public comments, regardless of their subject matter.
- All public comments would be heard early in the meeting, after the Pledge of Allegiance, invocation and presentations, but before reports and announcements. This would likely occur around 4:30-5:00 p.m. at most Council meetings, while many residents are still at work or commuting from work.
- Each person would have only one opportunity per meeting to speak, regardless of the number of agenda items the speaker wished to address.

Mayor Khan and Mike Carroll are a disgrace and developer sellouts.

Watch this policy change pass and then watch how they stack the meetings with controversial items, then make us choose just one to comment on. Cumulatively, if there are more than 20 speakers on all agenda items, then we only get 2 mins to speak. If more than 30 speakers, we only get 90 seconds.

"Yeah I'm not voting for Farrah Khan anymore. It's too bad we don't have any better candidates.

Farrah Khan: she was better than Shea but...has done a subpar job in my opinion.

Tammy Kim: verdict is still out. She engages on reddit so that's a few  points in her favor for me, silly as it may be. But it also seems like she generally agrees with what Farrah does.

Mike Carroll: shit job with OCPA, along w/ Farrah actually. Also has his share of baggage with the money or whatever Dee Fox loves to post about.

Anthony Kuo: also seems to just agree with what Farrah does. Doesn't seem like he has strong opinions. Seems slimy, kinda like he always has some hidden agenda. Seems very political, like he has higher political aspirations but may be limited to City Council (for now).

Larry Agran: controversial, has that dumbass ICNV propaganda paper, no matter how much he tries to pretend it isn't his. Failed at the GP a decade ago so he clings to the last thing he can, which is anything with the veterans cemetery/memorial. To say he comes with his share of baggage would be a massive understatement. Also has been in city council for like 4 decades. The boomers may not like this, but we need younger blood in City Council.

As a whole:

* FivePoint does whatever the fuck they want and no one on the council actually tries to hold them accountable for anything

* OCPA has been a disaster. One of my neighbors years ago was telling us how cool something like OCPA would be, but even she's no longer advocating for it because of his poorly it's been managed.

* I don't like Larry Agran, but that stupid rule where any agenda item must have a second (mayor is excluded from this) is so dumb. There are clear times when Larry is blackballed because no one will second something he wants to bring up. A year or so ago, I felt like this wouldn't be a big deal - having literally any other person support his agenda item should be easy if it's worth talking about. But it seems like they've really shut him out, which is unprofessional and disrespectful. I think 70% of the shit he'd bring up would be a waste of time, but he should still have the right and privilege to put something on the agenda.

"Haha.  I must not be ""smart"" for just being an engaged resident.  I don't question ""every source"" following Irvine municipal government, but I do know the following:    


Voice of OC - used to have good reporters, Adam Elmahrek, Spencer Custodio, etc.  The current guy, Noah Biesada is not good and just prints what he is sent by people with an interest.  Unlike a ""real"" news source, they constantly reprint re-tread articles to try to get clicks.   


Irvine Community News & Views - nothing but an Agran political mailer designed to fool voters and residents.  His daughter in law is the publisher and his former Campaign Manager and Planning Commissioner is the ""Editor.""  It's  not remotely real news in any way.  


Irvine Watchdog - Nothing but a blog from an increasingly smaller group of people with a variety specific point of view about Irvine.  Branda Lin writes completely one-sided hatchet jobs, Susan Sayre is delusional at best, and the rest of the group is barely relevant.  Once of the ""founders"" Jeanne Baran, is now Larry Agran's paid council aide.  They started as extremely naive anti-Concordia people and have evolved over the years to become mostly naive anti-Council majority people.  I don't have numbers to prove it, but their ""saturation"" in the City is non-existent and only the most inside insiders ever know it exists.  


OC Register - Alicia Robinson is very good but rarely covers Irvine anymore.  


LA Times - they do a good job, but cover Irvine even less.  


Irvine Standard - Irvine Company marketing piece.

Irvine City News - was very good, but seems to have gone dark.

"I recommend you look into ‘RHNA’ numbers, there are official mandates that Irvine has to provide much more affordable housing than it currently does. In past years the “affordable housing” built in Irvine does not meet many definitions of affordable, rather the housing built is affordable relative to other housing in Irvine. Another issue in the city is that because housing value is rising so rapidly, many companies are buying houses in Irvine, meaning that the houses purchased are either unoccupied or rented out which further inflates the cost of housing since a company has much more wealth than many working individuals. The reason these houses don’t even need to be occupied is because even without the addition of rental income, housing prices rise so rapidly in Irvine a company will get a profit if they keep the home and sell it in a few years. Another issue is that the Irvine company has a monopoly over so many of the properties in Irvine. Wealthier people and companies maintain political influence in Irvine and they don’t want to see any kind of limit on investment returns in rental properties so they work very hard to make sure the cost of housing keeps rising. I can’t speak specifically to the projects you mentioned but you’re absolutely right in acknowledging the issue. I moved to Santa Ana because it has rent control and a generally better housing landscape, though that’s not to say it’s affordable either. (also the reason I know all this is because I’m a grad student at uci who studies these topics) here’s a good link about rhna in Irvine https://www.cityofirvine.org/housing-element-update/rhna%E2%80%AFwho-decides-how-much-housing-needed%E2%80%AFand-what-kind%E2%80%AF",t2_5akmbejp,iz_kiwi,0,1646867640.0,0,t1_i01byyu,i01byyu,True,WonkyMom2020,t3_t9wzhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/irvine/comments/t9wzhz/affordable_housing_for_home_ownership_projects_in/,Affordable Housing for Home Ownership Projects in Irvine,/r/irvine/comments/t9wzhz/affordable_housing_for_home_ownership_projects_in/i01byyu/,3,r/irvine,0,3
"Personally, I like going to the District one for eyeware. I've gone to both and have always picked out my frames at the District. They have more and different designer options than the one on Technology.

I'm not sure if either one is better with the add-ons because theyre pretty standard features that are consistent between the both, but I also don't have too much experience with them because I just get blue light (which, if I'm not wrong, I think comes with the lens...?)

in my opinion, I think the frames are what sets the two Costcos apart, the lenses are the same at both.

EDIT: oops, I misread your second question! I like having the blue light coating for my glasses, I'm a student and am on my devices all the time so it's nice to have, my dad loves getting the transitions (but I dont, I think it's based on taste and the frame style too). If you're asking about quality, all the add-ons are pretty good. I've never tried the polarized ones, and I would love to try it.

"Your landlord is required by law to allow you to install a charger, but it's at your cost (California Civil Code section 1947.6). A charger is about $500 and the installation on a single family home can as low as $500. Don't forget permits. On apartments, it's going to depend on how long you're running 4 AWG electrical cable from the closet electrical panel, whether the main panel needs a subpanel, whether you'll need some type of submeter, etc... It's possible everything can get more complicated. I don't think it's worth it. You have plenty of charging options in Irvine. 

If you're in newer garden style apartments like Avella, they have 120 volt/20A outlets in the garages. Forget the large apartments that have parking garages. 

Property management sent out notices about how you shouldn't charge electric cars in garages and they would inspect once a year. Nonetheless, five neighbors and I would trickle charge our cars. It worked for me and I drove 20k miles per year. The garaged units didn't seem to be on the same meter as your apartment, so it was free.

"I think this takes a bit of explaining. $550 is to the Mayor's 2022 campaign. Individuals have limits to donating to campaigns in Irvine. This is only the beginning. 

After their plans are approved, Waterford (Sean Rawson) according to this investigative 8-part report, donates to candidates in the form of independent expenditures which have no limits. Independent expenditures can be made to support or oppose a candidate in the form of mailers, commercials, etc. 

""According to campaign finance forms, Waterford has given over $126,000 to current Long Beach politicians in recent years. The largest of those political donations were to the mayor’s Robert Garcia for Lt. Governor 2026 committee, which received $38,800 in contributions from three Waterford executives and the wives of two of those executives in the months **following the council’s approval of the financial arrangement**.""

The $550 is just the tip of the iceberg of what's to come before the November election.

"Tbh, it’s because their customer service is inefficient. They’re really nice, but I feel like they’re *too* attentive, considering there’s (from what I see) only one cashier taking orders. For example, if someone has questions or wants a rec, the cashiers can go on for minutes and minutes about the rec back and forth with the customer, not trying to speed up the convo at all despite the line being long. So it adds up and contributes to the line developing since it takes so long to simply take one order.

And, like others mentioned, the tea is good, which causes a consistent number of people to visit and revisit, leading to a decent amount of people trying to enter the line in the first place. The wait time once you order is super short, in my experience, so I can only surmise that it’s due to the ordering process itself.

"There’s a huge difference in cost when you use good tea leaves and real ingredients (think fruit, flower, milk, anything), compared to artificial enhanced….water, really.

"Management is being transferred to new affordable housing operators. The state joint powers authorities are purchasing the properties and the rents are pledged as repayment for the bonds. At the end of the term, the city receives a $400M asset at net present value. The property like most California real estate will appreciate at about 2%-3% per year on average. And the city can then do whatever it wants with it like make it more affordable (like below 80% median income). 

There is such a thing as missing middle housing, which this solves. There are people who make too much money for public assistance or are ineligible for traditional affordable housing yet make too little to afford the area. I.e. teachers. FYI, the vacancy rate in the region is about 2% meaning there's not a lot of housing out there. We're effectively at full occupancy.

For the lower income levels, Irvine has more below market housing than any other Orange County city.

"They did this for my apartment complex during my 2nd year (of course this was way before COVID so at the time it wasn't a health risk). They informed all the tenants in a letter and since it was renewal time for me, when I renewed my lease there was also an addendum about the construction going on, too. Not sure what exactly repairing the balconies entails at your apartment but when they did mine, they basically redid the rain gutters, redid the paint (went from a golden beige to some kind of pinkish-orange color), and changed the shape of the balcony. Not sure if they ever did enter my apartment because I was always at work.

Btw during the construction, I highly warn you that if you have your own garage and regularly park your car in there to move your car out of the garage before 8am if you know you'll be needing access to your car later that day, otherwise you will not be able to get your car out of the garage.
