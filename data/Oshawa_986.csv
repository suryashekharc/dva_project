"This city seems like it just wants to tax everything to death. We already have crazy high property taxes. Not sure why we need another layer of regulation for rentals.

Rental properties are already heavily regulated with the landlord and tenant act. The landlord and tenant act is heavily biased towards the tenant. Licensing will accomplish nothing except to charge landlords more tax dollars in licensing fees, which are only going to be passed along to tenants in the form of even higher rent prices. Additionally, this extra licensing will discourage some people from renting out their properties due to the extra pointless red tape.

The reason they brought this in around the college area was because of poor zoning choices that allowed single family houses to be built with too many bedrooms (built to rent out as many rooms as possible).

"Not an intersection but have to recognize Taunton and Naples, just east of Shoppers Drug Mart and across from The Beer Store.

1) The region needs to convert the island so you can't turn left from Naples out to Taunton. There isn't enough lead time from lights in either direction. 

2) Don't make the turn onto Naples there just because someone gives you a wave through. It's not safe just because they wave you. Multiple times a year, somebody writes off their car because the vehicle in the second lane doesn't see you coming.

"Sitting on a vacant property is bad business. 0

Let's see if i can break it down for you.

Say it's a $800,000 house. The owner puts 20% down and mortgage is $640,000 at a cost of $3028 a month at 3% over 25 years.

Property taxes would be around $3600 a year or about $300 a month.

Insurance on a rental like that would be about $180-$200 a month.

So let's say the 2 bedroom upstairs rents for $2200, and the basement 2 bedroom rents for $1800.

Total cost (not including incidentals) is $3500.

Total income is $4000 a month

Profit: $500

So say they didn't rent it out for 12 months. That means that year there was a net loss of $48,000. Meaning at $500 profit, they wouldn't be out of the red for 8 years.

Most owners would gladly accept lower rent just to keep the building occupied but when you have 40 applications for 1 property, you may as well jack the price as the demand is going to be the determining factor in the price. As long as a couple of those people are willing to pay the inflated prices, they will continually go up.

If a listing is put in, and they don't fill the vacancy, you'll see the price reduced to their break even. If it gets to the point where they still can't rent, they'll sell to recoupe costs.

The vast majority of properties value comes with holding for 10 years and then liquidating. As long as the property still remains cost neutral, that's fine for buyers.",t2_4dknyaqe,MikeTheMic81,0,1648080038.0,0,t1_i1v7s0g,i1v7s0g,False,lovesilver,t3_tkw8y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oshawa/comments/tkw8y6/21storey_tower_planned_for_king_and_mary_in_oshawa/,21-storey tower planned for King and Mary in Oshawa,/r/Oshawa/comments/tkw8y6/21storey_tower_planned_for_king_and_mary_in_oshawa/i1v7s0g/,3,r/Oshawa,0,3

"Brew Wizards in Oshawa board game cafe is run by friendly people with craft beer and coffee, if you like board games. 8Bit coffee in Whitby is the same bit with pinball and videogame machines.   
If you're into live music the Atria is ""rough around the edges"" but not a bad spot for metal and punk. The Biltmore is a bigger place and gets more established acts, but they used to have a monthly funk night that was banging, definately check that out if it comes back.  Oshawa music hall is planning on being a new live venue but hasn't opened yet.   
The art gallery downtown Oshawa used to have an open friday night event with a bar and live music once a month. Very friendly crowd with a great gallery, easy to make friends there.  
Covid pretty much turned this city to a social ghost town, but if everything opens up I can a more entertaining environment returning.   
Other things to check out is the Oshawa Art Association events, Town Brewery, Little Beasts Brewery in Whitby, Manantler Brewery in Bowmanville.

"I’m always cynical about this sort of thing, fearing that a company that advertises testing for something is likely to find it and recommend immediate and expensive treatment.  This company may be legit, and they seem to have good reviews on google though.
Here’s what I suggest:  If you search for Guide For Radon Measurements in Residential Dwellings there is excellent info on Canada.ca.  I highly recommend you review this so you can understand the results.  Testing should take a long time (months) and is best performed in the winter.  There are places you should never place a detector and it’s best if it’s checked by a certified lab.  It’s also important that you are testing an area that you commonly use.  It’s likely high in your basement, but if you are rarely in your basement, does it matter?  Once you have a bit of knowledge you can better determine if the testing company is honest or not when they explain what they are going to do.

"For your last point it's no rent control for buildings made after 2018. The reasoning for that was the Tories claimed rent control disincentivized people from building new rental stock. Which I'm not entirely sold on but even if it was true it still ignores the much bigger issue of councils and voters blocking or slowing down the building of new rental stock due to zoning issues. 

So sure with no rent control developers might be more incentivized to build apartments/townhomes but the one place they want to build (GTA) they can't do so with most of it being zoned for single family housing only.

"I'll repeat what I said in r/canadahousing:

>The main reason for this is a massive influx of people from other GTA cities and international students while NIMBYs have ruled local government for decades largely vetoing any new apartment building. Most of the ones that do exist were built before the mid 1990s.  
>  
>The only major rental development is near DC/UOIT. It took a decade of illegal slum land lording in the surrounding single family zoned housing and the many complaints from local residents for council to actually do something. Even then that housing is only for students and doesn't meet the demand from other groups. Though they did build 2 retirement apartment complexes in the north end (but only after developing 99% of the land for single family housing).  
>  
>Feds doing everything to increase demand for housing while local governments refuse to rezone or build is a terrible thing that must come to an end. It's absurd this has allowed to go on for essentially 3 decades now.You can't expect renters to absorb ever rising rents like this.

TL;DR: Blame city council for not thinking long term and being stuck in this vision of Oshawa only being single family homes filled with families with kids.

Now the single family homes are still there but any on sale now are all getting bought out by mom & pop landlords/RE investors to turn into de facto rental housing. Even if neighborhoods weren't planned for this.

I mean just take a look at the homes in North Oshawa with their tiny driveways and no space for parking. But hey I guess as long as everything looks the same as it did visually in the 1980s everything is fine according to council and NIMBYs.

">it's not like I'm looking for advice. Just clarity on why some people act thay way.

You'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure this out.

These bins are made of cheap plastic that is expected to withstand elements ranging from -30c to +30c. They're going to break eventually and there could be conditions that cause them to be far more brittle than usual.

They'll replace your bins at no charge to you. Sure it's a pain in the ass but that's a pretty good problem to have.

Our house is slightly recessed by about a meter compared to other houses and it's an end house which understandably puts our bins just out of a collector's eye-line if they don't back up to the end of the street. Collectors often miss us and I've had to have them come back multiple times to collect what we put out so perhaps there is some animosity from our collector leading to some angry bin handling.       

My parents in Whitby have had a similar issue with their collector and their plastic garbage can which I even witnessed - the collector went full out Donkey Kong and held the empty bin above his head and forcefully threw it to the ground.",t2_rob2f,UncleWinstomder,0,1647527083.0,0,t1_i10slcz,i10slcz,False,BlackHatSlacker,t3_tg9zkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oshawa/comments/tg9zkb/garbage_boys/,Garbage Boys,/r/Oshawa/comments/tg9zkb/garbage_boys/i10slcz/,7,r/Oshawa,0,7

"The problem is Oshawa is a huge vote splitting riding hence why Colin keeps getting back in. When you can see it in the polling within these past election results you can see the NDP/Liberals splitting the vote which is why Colin keeps getting elected. I think this why Colin keeps getting in is because both Liberals/NDP split causing him to be re-elected every single time. I honestly feel like there should be term limits regardless of MP. Too many of these politicians make it their career.

Other option is to answer, press 1 to ""talk to an officer"" and then scream in the phone as you mash all the keys until they hang up on you.

At a glance, it seems like a solid alternative for people who don't want/need/can't afford an automobile, transit, etc. People should have the freedom to dictate their means of transportation when they can't reasonably justify other alternatives. There are certainly people out there who can't even afford the monthly bus pass fees or the daily fares on DRT. Maybe this is a solid alternative.

I know it's not so black and white because I'm sure it's a question of whether or not Oshawa has the infrastructure to implement this with regards to roads/sidewalks or whatever.. but it's not a bad idea when gas is pushing $2/L.

"It refers to the 12 fruits/vegetables with the highest amount of pesticides and pesticide residue. Spinach, bell peppers, strawberries and nectarines etc are on the list. Something like 90% of the list were found to have residue of 2 or more different pesticides in North America.

The idea behind it is that rather than buying ALL organic food, since that is costly and not always necessary, to focus on getting organic if its one of those 12 foods, since it has the highest impact, we eat the skin, etc. There is also a ""clean 15"" list which has been found to have much lower instances of pesticides or a negligible effect since we don't eat the skin, it is hardier and can be grown without pesticides, and most pesticide residue resides there and is not present in what we eat. Broccoli, avocado, pineapple, etc.  Also it avoids GMOs in foods though im not really concerned about non-GMO as much, personally.  

My aunt got me into this stuff after her cancer diagnosis, and her oncologist was telling her to focus on organic since there appears to be some correlation between environmental toxins (including food) and cancer rates. Since its ridiculously expensive to feed a family of 6 all organic, she found that list really useful.
