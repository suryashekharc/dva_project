"Back when I lived in a different city, there was a neighborhood that had “good bones” for becoming more walkable and bike friendly, but city council kept dragging its feet in terms of adding bike lanes, crosswalks, and stop signs, so eventually, an group just did it themselves without permission. 

Motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians obeyed the new lines and signs as it all looked totally official.  City council got mad and tried to undo it, but by then, public support was there, and it was cheaper and easier to just let it stay than to try to rip signs out and repaint. 

Similarly, have you ever heard the story of the guy who thought an LA freeway sign was confusing and went out and changed the sign himself?

"“Union” is a broad term. They can be structured and organized in many ways, and they can interact with companies in many ways.

This country needs to educate itself on the many ways unions can organize, and how legislation can both promote and hold back the various ways Labor can organize. 

Some other counties use sectoral unions where all workers, across multiple firms, are unionized together. 

Some places have wage boards consisting of union reps, the companies, and the govt all negotiate wages for an entire sector of the economy.

The US “enterprise” system requires every little 10 person coffee shop or every individual Amazon warehouse to unionize one-by-one, and creates an incredibly antagonistic “worker versus management” hyper-adversarial system. 

Another idea is to look at co-determination models (like in Germany) where rather than unions and management *fighting* as they do in the US model of adversarial unions, both workers and management get spots on a company board to *co-determine* the company policies in a way that’s mutually beneficial. 

Unions are at a severe structural disadvantage due to our dumb labor laws.  Young pro-union activists should learn more about these different union structures, and the legal framework needed to support them, and also learn how our current labor laws could actually be holding back America’s ability to organize labor in the more popular and effective ways we see in other parts of the world.

"There are totally bad dogs out there, most breeds through generations of responsible breeding have produced dogs with acceptable temperaments but with pitbulls in particular it’s a fucking shit show especially when you add in the fact that there a people who are intentionally selecting dogs for aggression. 

Now I don’t think there’s anything fundamentally wrong with the breeds that make up “pitbulls” where they couldn’t be bred to have acceptable temperaments but that’s not where we are. 

If it was just shitty owners there’s a ton of other breeds that are totally capable of ripping apart kids and adults, but that’s not what the numbers show. Deaths, brutal maimings, and bites are dominated by pitbulls despite the fact that they make up a fraction of the total dog population. Christ have you ever seen what they do to people when they snap, it’s some of the most horrific shit you’ll ever see.

And the numbers are on the rise too and will keep rising until people get serious about spaying and neutering the current population, because out of all breeds they’re the least sterilized, and get the breeding under control.",t2_3zmpm2s5,felis_scipio,0,1648267618.0,0,t1_i25m3u8,i25m3u8,False,Sal_Tinez,t3_to1zrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/to1zrd/2_arrested_in_suspected_intentional_dog_attack_of/,"2 arrested in suspected intentional dog attack of cat in Frankford, authorities say",/r/philadelphia/comments/to1zrd/2_arrested_in_suspected_intentional_dog_attack_of/i25m3u8/,1,r/philadelphia,0,1

"I've never said, ""it's fine"". I've said that the vast majority, like 95% of murders is petty beefs, drug related, is targeted, gang shit, scoreboard shit, and is highly localized to certain areas. Every now and then something tragic like this happens, like that grandzohl guy, the poor guy walking his dog in brewerytown, and now this. 

My point has been, if you eliminate the beefs and targeted killings, the drug beefs, you're left with a homicide rate that's extremely low. Like Switzerland or Denmark low.  Not trying to undermine this tragedy, or any of the others that die. They have family too, even the shitbirds killing each other for bullshit, or drugs or whatever. 

My issue is with those who hyperventilate over the violence, without trying to look at the whole picture. Some random dude in fishtown isn't in any real danger. Neither is fairmount, chestnut hill, rittenhouse, east falls, or any number of decent areas.  

It may be killadelphia, but not for most. Is that fucked up? Yes. Should we do something about it? Yes. What should we do?

"Yeah I hope so too. If they haven’t been fight dogs for very long, they can probably be rehabilitated. They will probably never be safe for cats, but it’s really not that big of a deal—you can go to any animal shelter and see tons of dogs that are marked as “NO CATS”. People don’t realize how common it is for dogs to be cat aggressive. Any dog that chases squirrels would also kill a cat if given the opportunity, unless they were raised with cats and don’t view them as prey for that reason. 

Even if they’re dog aggressive, they could probably be rehomed unless they were lunging at every dog they saw on the street. It would just have to be an experienced dog owner.

I really hope the dogs get another chance. They deserve so much better than these shitstains gave them. I’ve got an “aggressive breed” and he’s currently cuddling in my lap.

"This became a lot longer than I expected, apologies. 


I don't really have any since I don't read research papers on them, I read about where I live at that level of detail because it interests me.

My general thoughts on it are that there are different factors working in each region.

Chicago for example is in the rust belt, the financial situation of the state isn't good so taxes currently and in the future are an issue. Chicago is still thought of as a very dangerous city and the cost of living is high in the nice places. In addition you have the snow belt to sunbelt national trend also at play. 

Miami has a lot condos that were all built around the same time, so that condo collapse that happened has freaked people out both in terms of safety and massive cost increases to cover repairs. So I'm sure that's been a factor, in addition to Florida being a shithole. I've met people who moved from Florida to Philly and had very few positive things to say about Miami. So  opportunities to sell to an investor or person moving from the north at a good price are high right now. 


I think in the coming decades, like 20-30 years out, Philly, Chicago, and many of the rust belt cities will see large amounts of inbound domestic migration. 

I think that'll happen because of climate change, and future transit trends. I think that in the next 10 to 15 years we'll start to see a large outbound migration from the southwest because it's running out of water, and becoming so hot that its hostile to human life for much of the year. 

The Midwest has been emptying for decades, I don't see that changing because there's no jobs there, and also a growing water problem as the major ground reservoir empties out. Effectively turning much of the plains back into the grassy desert early that frontiersman described it as prior to the discovery of the aquaphor. 

The traditional South will probably be stable even though the climate will slowly become tropical.

The Pacific Northwest will continue to grow because the climate zone is mild and only expected to stay that way with climate change, there's no water problems, and the job scene is good. The threat of a earthquakes doesn't deter people from wanting to live there. 

I think the same thing applies to the Northeast as well. There's no foreseeable water shortage coming to the Northeast if anything we'll have too much. The climate will become more mild in the Northeast as a whole. So less bitter winters, and longer summer and falls times, Philly will basically get Virginia's climate zone. The region is geologically stable, and the Northeast is not susceptible to frequent extreme weather events. 

All of that will make this an attractive area in another 20 or so years. With the inbound investment a lot the problems the city faces today and in the next few years will finally have the resources to effectively deal with them, assuming the political system also changes as population gets shaken up again.",t2_dswky,AbsentEmpire,0,1648253686.0,0,t1_i24uwhg,i24uwhg,False,ADFC,t3_tnb9yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tnb9yk/philly_lost_nearly_25000_residents_in_the_first/,"Philly lost nearly 25,000 residents in the first year of the pandemic",/r/philadelphia/comments/tnb9yk/philly_lost_nearly_25000_residents_in_the_first/i24uwhg/,2,r/philadelphia,0,2

"I wonder what is going to happen to the dogs. I’ve got a dog with a high prey drive that killed 3 cats in his previous home (because the previous owners were idiots and kept adopting cats after he killed them). He’s never killed a cat on my watch, but I’ve seen how he acts when he sees them…honestly it doesn’t look anything like what these 2 dogs did. When my dog’s prey drive is activated, he completely loses control and forgets about everything except the cat. He’s a hunting dog after all, so he’s literally doing what he was bred to do. It’s instinct. 

These dogs looked like they didn’t really give a shit about the cat and wanted to keep walking, and then the owners turned them toward the cats and they attacked. As if they’d been trained to do it. I think they’re probably fight dogs. I wonder if the police will bust a whole ring from this.

If the dogs are just cat aggressive, then they can be easily rehomed to people who won’t be asshats and expose them to cats. Lots of dogs can’t be trusted around cats (all greyhounds have extremely high prey drives and wouldn’t be okay to have around cats, for example). But if they’re fight dogs then they’ll probably have to be put down, which is honestly a fucking shame.

"Late to the party but oh well I’ve got a rant too. I moved here from Boston last year. I’ve heard a bazillion times that Boston drivers are THE worst but that’s bullshit. Boston drivers are aggressive as hell but across the board pretty safe (check serious injury stats, wicked low, mostly just fender benders). Roads are laid out like overcooked spaghetti up there and you NEED to be alert to even get where you’re going, let alone not hit someone/something. But Philly has long, straight, wide roads with plenty of visibility so drivers aren’t nearly as alert and simply just don’t give a fuck what’s going on around them. Add on top of that not a single cop to enforce traffic laws and it’s total anarchy. As a personal rule in Boston, I always assume that anyone in a car is an asshole. In Philly I assume they’re literally homicidal. As a biker, I’ve been forced off the road 4 times in 5 months of biking, two of which happened with NO OTHER CARS on the road. It’s scary as fuck and has NEVER happened in 10+ years biking in downtown Boston. The amount of hit and run accidents/deaths is disgusting and honestly got me to stop biking for a few months last fall. Be safe out there folks, and if you’re biking, wear a helmet.

"It’s gonna to difficult to get all of those things you want if living in a house here in Philadelphia. For example, there are many houses in NE Philly that are close to nature trails and have backyards, with a few good restaurants and bars, but you’ll be quite far from Center City and thus Museums. Fishtown is an easy drive to center city, but good luck finding a home with an adequate yard there. 

A house in Chestnut Hill comes closest to having all of those things you want, but do note houses ain’t cheap there (though they are very nice).

I've seen cyclists ignore all traffic laws and swerve around buses and cars and I don't mean the dirt bikes in Philly - I mean commuters.

All this said is not to minimize the point of cars are bigger and obviously are more dangerous and that needs to be addressed. It's a mess on everyone's part but until PPD will actually start cracking down on any of it - expect it to get worse as the season breaks.",t2_6c547,FittyPat,1,1648243276.0,0,t1_i247rde,i247rde,True,gigibuffoon,t3_tnntzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tnntzv/do_you_drivers_not_care_about_other_peoples_lives/,Do you drivers not care about other people's lives?,/r/philadelphia/comments/tnntzv/do_you_drivers_not_care_about_other_peoples_lives/i247rde/,1,r/philadelphia,0,1

"You guys are talking like waking up early is the worst thing that could ever happen to a kid. 

The real problem is the distractions and overwhelming homework that causes a child to become sleep deprived. Staying up past midnight doing assignments should never happen. 

When I taught math in Philly, I had best results by allowing students to learn through in-person group work while allowing time at the end of the class for individual learning (i.e. time to work on homework so you don't have to do all of it at home). It's a better system because you can browse around the room to make sure they're not copying, and if they get stuck on a problem, you can work with them one on one to clear up any unique misunderstandings. The kids who wouldn't take advantage of this time and would goof off are the same kids who wouldn't do the homework anyways, so it's no skin off my ass. 

I never understood the teachers who'd just ramble all day to fill time then assign a shit ton of homework. You're making both of your lives harder. Cut out the filler from your lessons and let students actually work in class, instead of spending hours at home meticulously plugging equations into wolfram alpha. 

I don't want to be like, ""It's the teacher's fault these students are sleep deprived!!!"" because there's thousands of other distractions that cause students to cut back on sleep (phone addiction, hanging out with friends, etc.), but teachers could be doing a lot more to help.",t2_7rmnt,palerthanrice,1,1648237935.0,0,t1_i23ur6n,i23ur6n,True,User_Name13,t3_tnn5uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tnn5uv/philadelphia_school_district_board_adopts_202223/,Philadelphia School District board adopts 2022-23 calendar with high school start times moving later,/r/philadelphia/comments/tnn5uv/philadelphia_school_district_board_adopts_202223/i23ur6n/,-2,r/philadelphia,0,-2

"Yeah, I think a lot of folks don't have a good grasp on the amount of money middle class folks have in their retirement accounts. (understandable given a lot of redditors skew younger). This is exactly the kind of policy that the actual rich people will find a way to wiggle out/ they have enough money that its not a big deal anyway, and middle class people will get financially punched in the face. I have a slightly better than average salary, and I'm certainly a financial boon to the city (I pay plenty of taxes, go out, spend money around the city etc.) but a policy like this would seriously make me reconsider living here, and I'm sure many people in the 'up and coming' neighborhoods would feel the same as me.
