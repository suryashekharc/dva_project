"Yeah, that's one use!  When each atom explodes, it produces its own particular mix of radiation.  Since the radioactive isotopes are chemically *almost* the same as the regular non-explodey isotopes, you can make molecules out of them and they'll get drawn into certain types of tissue.  You can treat cancer with it, or do special kinds of imaging- if you're interested in a certain kind of cell, the radiation can light it up and make it a lot more visible than it would be otherwise.  Since the isotopes are made here instead of being shipped in from elsewhere, there's a lot of useful isotopes that can do great things that would just expire in the mail on the way here.",t2_a2d0t,tjernobyl,0,1648254518.0,0,t1_i24wmmu,i24wmmu,False,Who_am_I_yesterday,t3_tnv3vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tnv3vv/locally_produced_isotopes_now_in_use_in_cancer/,Locally produced isotopes now in use in cancer diagnosis,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tnv3vv/locally_produced_isotopes_now_in_use_in_cancer/i24wmmu/,2,r/ThunderBay,0,2

"So, every atom is a tiny lump of protons and neutrons.  The number of protons determines what it is.  If there's one proton, it's hydrogen, if there's 6 it's carbon, etc.  Now, there's a number of neutrons in there as well.  If there's 6 protons and 12 neutrons in an atom, it's plain ol' carbon.  If there's 13, it's plain ol' carbon.  If it's 14, it's gonna eventually explode.  Like, if you leave a pound of carbon-14 on your shelf and wandered off for 5,000 years, you'd find that half the atoms have exploded and turned into other atoms.  Carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 are all isotopes of carbon.  Some isotopes explode quicker than others.

"Business people will always say they can’t pay more, increasing the minimum wage will bankrupt them. They have this on AutoPlay and parrot it at every opportunity. It doesn’t matter what the facts are.  
Many businesses that hire people with limited education, limited skills and limited future prospects are perfectly fine with paying people the lowest amount possible and with treating their employees like dirt. They are fine with this because they are confident that if these people quit there will be other losers to take their place. You can call this the Greater Fool Theory of Employment. A lot of the time they are not wrong.  
The Pandemic yielded a huge insight: There are millions of Canadians who have limited education, limited skills and limited futures who are absolutely ESSENTIAL to the functioning of the Canadian economy. While some of us were lucky to work from home or even quit our jobs, these people took on huge risks working in grocery stores, health settings, slaughterhouses, nursing homes, driving trucks, and many other places so that society could function.   
What do they get for their efforts? Nothing.  
Canada is already deep into a massive demographic crisis that will last for decades. There are already shortages of workers in all types of occupations and that will only get worse. Immigration can only partly address this problem.  
Employers will have to increase their employees’ wages, or they will go out of business.  
Driving around Thunder Bay, I have to wonder how many coffee shops, convenience stores, restaurants, grocery stores, and many other types of businesses do we really need, and how many are really economically viable. I think the real answer is a lot less than we think.

It's also mixed lob ball, so there are some rules that are supposed to even the field a bit....but mostly they just try not to kill them selves or each other during the game (ie no sliding and a safety line at home plate)",t2_5i9rsfze,northerngurl333,0,1648241586.0,0,t1_i243qt3,i243qt3,True,mrjelloman_,t3_tnpxtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tnpxtl/baseball_beer_leagues/,Baseball beer leagues,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tnpxtl/baseball_beer_leagues/i243qt3/,1,r/ThunderBay,0,1

"Depending on the level of play you're looking for, there are a few leagues in town that I'm aware of. Some are ""slo-pitch"" which I think just refers to it being an underhand pitch but it can get rather fast. There is also lob-ball where the pitch has to land on a mat behind the batter - this one seems a little more for people just going out to have some beers and have a good time.

I was part of the Thunder Bay Mixed Slo-pitch league a few years ago and it wasn't a great experience. Some people take it very seriously. On top of that, you have to Ump games either before or after your own which was never fun. Especially when some of the hardos disagree with your calls. It's fun when you're playing a team that is also just out there to have fun, but that's maybe only half the time. The season also kind of dragged on. I think we played twice a week, from mid May to early October with like 3 or 4 tournaments on weekends.

"I agree with your point. I think how you worded it is dumb. Let me get the exact quote from you that I’ve been having an issue with. And that I already commented about.


“The issue is that the logic of “masks should be required in schools because covid spreads easily in school settings” although correct, leads only to masks being required forever… “

Which is why I said “the argument isn’t keep masks in school forever” it’s “keep them in schools for like another week or two” 

Maybe I didn’t make that clear enough originally. 

But you worded it like it’s mask off now or never. Which isn’t the case, and that’s the point I was making.

Then my point about public transit... just to clear it up now. Is why are people getting pissy about masks in schools maybe being kept for a bit longer. But not city busses and cabs n shit.

"And we still see cases of the bubonic plague. Do we still have plague doctors running around? 

Sure it’s an extreme example. But things end, is it too early for covid, probably. But if your worried about it, then keep your mask on. I do at work because I’m seeing 200+ people in a day. And my sister wears one at school, because there will be hundreds of kids without. There will also be an uptick next Christmas, this Easter, and probably every single other holiday this year. Should we just shut the world down every holiday?

It’s a shitty situation. But it’s at the point where we can start leaving it behind. Key word being can.

"It depends on how much you're going to do yourself. I know we renovated a small house recently here, and poured a concrete floor but got a family member to do the concrete and to pour a floor in a 7x10 slab was about 1000$ worth of concrete. All in all repairing the space cost 6000$ just for material. The only thing we did was repair one wall, put in new insulation and replace the floor with concrete and rig it for I floor heating. 

I feel like from that, just the materials could easily cost 20-30 000 dollars to build a house, and most contractors make 30-60$/hour.

If you have land that requires permits you should probably also factor that in, because you will need it to build.

If you want to build a whole house, I would put aside at least 50 000$ and that might be on the lower end. Because it's not considering electricians to wire the house, and plumbers to put in your toilets, and bathtubs.

Finishing a bathroom can be pretty expensive too. It's probably a good idea to put in the electrical and plumbing when you build the house if you intend to have it one day. You would have to redo all the drywall to put the electrical in later and it can be logicaticallt complicated to put in plumbing after you build especially if you're gonna have a concrete slab.

To be on the safe side, if you want a house built and you're not doing the labor yourself, it would be wise to set aside at least 100 000$. It's not nice to run out of money half way through building so getting real quotes from some contractors would be a good idea.",t2_4e6lsxw9,shiddytclown,0,1648020121.0,0,t1_i1rnczt,i1rnczt,False,aguwritsuko,t3_tkcii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tkcii6/cost_to_build_a_1storey_rural_farmhouse_prepost/,Cost to build a 1-storey rural farmhouse?

"'Overestimate' and 'potholes' in the same sentence made me laugh. Even if the pothole #s aren't an overshoot, the depth of them needs to be accounted for (assume the puddle is never *just* a puddle, so on and so forth), too.
Considering 90% of potholes on certain roads land exactly where my back right tire is, that's not a good plan when there's someone in my blind spot in the lane beside me. I get your point.

ETA: I'm on my G2. I'm not going above 5 over *anywhere*. Even when I need to be in the left lane. Am I that person going 54 on the stretch on Dawson between Paquette and Circle K? Yeah. I am. Do I want to be? No. But the time of day when I'm usually driving, it's *busy* in both lanes, and I have to turn left at Hilldale. I'd rather do 54 in the 50 zone in the left lane, dealing with the massive GMC Sierra on my rear bumper, rather than stay in the right lane and possibly never get to change into the inner lane.

"-You can either make your life here or waste it while getting a side of crippling student debt on the side. 
-From day one email your prof, look up a paper they wrote and sound interested about it. You will get on their good student list. There is no harm in being a teachers pet. Ask questions but not stupid ones. Don’t be philosophical too.
-Your program Chair is your Goto for course registration related issues. But he is not your guidance councillor. There is a difference. I do not know what your back ground is but if you are out of high school, this is different system all together. When you ask for help in here, they expect you too already have a solution and all they want to do is give their okay on the matter. This goes for everything. 
-Treat your assignments as your final exam. If your assignments are worth more than 10 % they will make a huge difference in your mark. If you do good on midterm and assignments. You will pass the course no issues even if you bomb the final as you would be eligible for special exam. It’s an exam you do twice in your university lifetime to get a 50 to pass a course. Basically redoing your final exam. 
-Be approachable and also approach people when you need help. You will be surprised how many people would want to talk to you after you start the conversation. 
-If you want to have fun, good luck. We have like two night clubs and all the bars in town are frozen in a time capsule. 
-it’s better if you drive, bus service is okay but the convenience in -30 weather is priceless. Also do install a block heater. With out that you will be asking for trouble. The kind that will cost thousands.
-There will be good days and bad days. There will be days when you would think this the best thing ever, there will also be days when you think this is the worst decision in your life. If you want to make it till the end, make sure you put in enough work to stay in between. That is a healthy balance between studying and fun.

"The vocal idiots will bitch and complain about any companies/businesses keeping them.  Some people will continue to wear their masks as they have people they want to protect, and I'm sure there will be insensitive assholes who will try to shame and bully those who continue to wear masks, which when you rationally think about it is odd.  The government told them to wear masks and they complained and called people who complied and wore them sheep.  The government now tells them they no longer have to wear masks, and they'll comply thereby becoming the very sheep they called other people.

If there are other recent studies I would be interested to learn about them.Canada is tenth in this list. On almost every metric used in the study Canada is at the bottom of the heap. 

The U.S. is eleventh but the authors note that it is far below Canada.Most of the countries with the most successful systems use a combination of public and private insurance, with the latter operating in according to government regulation. These are varied, there is no master formula that everyone follows.There are other less wealthy countries that have successful public-private systems.

I am not taking a ‘the grass is greener over there, let’s do what they do’ position.And this is not the same as saying ‘I have money, I’ll go get an operation tomorrow’.Canada needs to get to the point where there can be an adult discussion of how to make our system better, and that includes looking seriously at models in other countries.Otherwise we will continue to have a system that only meets the lowest expectations and clearly is far worse than it needs to be.",t2_k00eurja,AnyUntalkativeBunny,0,1647702521.0,0,t1_i1ad6nm,i1ad6nm,True,AnyUntalkativeBunny,t3_thjaz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/thjaz0/thunder_bay_doctor_shortage/,Thunder Bay Doctor Shortage,/r/ThunderBay/comments/thjaz0/thunder_bay_doctor_shortage/i1ad6nm/,2,r/ThunderBay,0,2

"It's why the Northern Ontario School of Medicine exists.  It was supposed to solve the problem by having regional representation in the hope that locals would get in and stay in the region or ""outsiders"" would climatize themselves to life in the region.  Problem is, no one who has money wants to live in bumfucknowhere because there is nothing for them to do (from what I understand it's usually their wives who complain).  The government can't force doctors to work in certain regions.

As for it being a Thunder Bay only thing, it's widespread throughout the province and the country.  Current statistics I can find are almost a decade old, but 10% of people in Ontario do not have access to a doctor, and over 15% of Canadians (25.6 per cent of people in Quebec, 18.7 per cent of those in Saskatchewan and 18 per cent Alberta!).

"Exactly. You can work for them but you won’t be in the union until you start the apprenticeship. The reason I mention this being a better option is because if you are in with the company then you are *almost* guaranteed to get an apprenticeship at some point (provided you are a good worker. It can go south due to poor work ethic). Whereas if you’re just trying to get in through the union, it will be a guessing game until the moment you get a call. You can just continue working doing whatever and wait for a call, especially if you don’t want to deal with a pay cut to just labour/driver parts.

"Firstly thank you for providing some companies, it is a bit difficult finding exactly what I am looking for but I persevere. I am hoping that I can use my past experience and credentials to leverage my way in sooner rather than later.

To make sure I am understanding this correctly, even if I get employed in a trade union company my apprenticeship will not officially start until I have received received approval from the union itself? For example, spend a year working in a shop doing general work showing co-workers that Ive a clue and that I am worth the time investment? If that is the case I may just fire off a few resumes to companies for any old position as long as it is in proximity to what the people doing what I want to be doing. 

For trades, are there any that you can think of that you would suggest to someone like myself that are both in demand, and high paying? I really do not have a significant preference to trades, I enjoy working with tools, people, and even doing paperwork, and am confident I could excel in most if not all trades.

"Great choice! We have halls for each of those unions in town. It is notoriously tough getting into them, but well worth it. You sort of have two routes you can take to get into a union.  


1. Go through the hall directly - drop off a resume, fill out the forms, do what's needed. Don't expect a call right away, but the trick to this route is to keep bugging them. Go into the hall, or call frequently. You'll have a much greater chance at getting called.
2. Get in with a union company -  If you can get in with one of these union companies, they can get your apprenticeship kickstarted. This might be the better of the two routes. Even if you get in with a company as a shop/parts guy, or labourer, you can at least build the relationship required for them to trust you enough to invest in you. It might take a year to do so, but at least you'll be working (and learning the industry) and not just waiting for a call.

Every trade will have both union and non-union companies in town doing work. I'm not even sure if there is a comprehensive list of all of these companies somewhere, but you might have to poke around and ask. I'll put some companies down below that I know for sure are unionized:

">So you're arguing these people threatened to, ""overthrow the government,"" in the same way that you would argue that a person was going to murder a crowd of people because he drew a picture of a gun on a piece of paper?

No, that is not what I said in the least. And if you somehow got that out of what I said, you need to work on your reading comprehension

To use your analogy, this would be like someone dumping a 5 gallon bucket of sodium hydroxide into the water supply for the city, thinking that it would kill people. It doesn't matter that it would be so dilute by the time it got to anybody's tap that it wouldn't even be homeopathically dangerous, the hypothetical person sincerely believed that they were doing something that would have their desired result and took actions to try and achieve it. 

Nobody with more than 2 functioning neurons sincerely believes that drawing a gun on a piece of paper will result in anyone being killed. 

&#x200B;

>Framing the situation as if there was going to be some serious coup attempt, like an armed insurrection, blood on the streets, etc., when in reality it was a bunch of morons who didn't understand how our system worked and tried to appeal to govenor general remove the PM, peacefully.  If that isn't some hyperbolic fear-mongering, then nothing is.

Their stated goal was the overthrow of the democratically elected government.. The fact that they didn't want to use guns (except for the group at Coutts that DID want to use guns) does not mean it was any less an attempt at insurrection. 

&#x200B;

>Also, as for omicron, it became so infectious, the scientific studies concluded that everyone was going to get it, and that being vaccinated was not going to make much of a difference.  They were studying viral loads in the summer of last year with Delta patients and found viral loads between vaccinated and unvaccinated were identical.

Prove it. Provide the studies.. Not articles by people who claimed to have read the studies.. Provide the actual study. 

And don't confuse ""peak viral load"" with viral load. PVL is just the measure of the highest point along the curve. It does not say the speed of increase or decrease, or the duration of the curve. That would be like saying that a Ferrari and my 12 year old pickup are the same thing because on the 401, the speed limit is the same for both of them. The Ferrari gets to speed right away.. My truck would need a bit of a run-up. 

&#x200B;

>There is no evidence that a vaccinated person with delta, omicron, was therefore less likely to spread it to anyone.  That is horseshit.  Sticking your hand out of the window of a speeding car is technically slowing it down, but it has no chance of actually stopping it, especially if the gas pedal is on the floor.  That's essentially the situation with omicron.

If you want to claim that, then you need to prove it.. Again, with science. Provide the studies proving that the total infections are the same. 

&#x200B;

>That's why we're opening up again, also, because omicron did what the vaccine could never do, which was innoculate everyone with robust immunity. 

There you go lying again. Omicron has been shown to re-infect people, even if they had Omicron previously. It is rare, but it does happen. 

Oh, and we are re-opening because of the summer election cycle in Ontario, not because Doug is following any scientific recommendations. 

&#x200B;

>I mean, as soon as Trudeau, himself boosted, caught covid and isolated to, ""protect others,"" it completely evapourated the whole reason for mandating vaccines, which was to, ""protect public spaces,""  Then again, forcing truckers to get vaccinated to continue to do their job unimpeded wasn't a means to that end either, because they work in a solitary environment, so there are some serious questions about why the government even went forward with that policy.

Nobody ever promised you that vaccines are a magical force field. They significantly reduce your chance of being infected.. Unless you want to live like the bubble-boy, nothing will prevent 100% of infections. So Anyone being infected after vaccination is only proof of your complete lack of understanding about even the most fundamental immunological principals.",t2_nd18d,Skogula,0,1647639490.0,0,t1_i17g81z,i17g81z,False,ResidentEvil0IsOkay,t3_tggpyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tggpyb/freedom_protestors_will_be_at_it_again_on/,Freedom 'Protestors' will be at it again on Saturday March 19th,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tggpyb/freedom_protestors_will_be_at_it_again_on/i17g81z/,3,r/ThunderBay,0,3

In any case these facts were available *before* Trudeau implemented his restriction on truckers.  So that means the government is horribly horribly slow to react to new information, or they were choosing to listen to, ""experts,"" who were reluctant to accept new information, until the evidence became too overwhelming to continue to lie.

"Start of recorded history being the Bronze Age, well after humans had developed complex social structures and hierarchies.  To find universal freedom (average chance of successful outcome when born) there are few options before universal suffrage (20th century).

It is easily omitted that all “free societies” before then had significant caveats. Those people: Women, foreigners, non-dominant culture, non-state religion, and non-aristocracy were all significantly less free than before the second half of the 20th century. 

The concept of “freedom” and the “state” is difficult.  The comparison between a nation of millions versus a nomadic tribal group or city state of thousands or a feif of hundreds of thousands is wrought with “apples to oranges” contrasts. 

If we limit our analysis to over 500,000 persons (beyond the size of an individual warlord) it becomes apparent that to manage that many humans many freedoms must be limited to allow the group to continue while maximizing quality of life. 

Anthropology, archaeology and recorded history show is that although an individual may have freedoms, those freedoms are often incompatible with societal living.",t2_e2nfco7i,Gold_Scholar_4219,0,1647622893.0,0,t1_i16az12,i16az12,False,ResidentEvil0IsOkay,t3_tggpyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tggpyb/freedom_protestors_will_be_at_it_again_on/,Freedom 'Protestors' will be at it again on Saturday March 19th,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tggpyb/freedom_protestors_will_be_at_it_again_on/i16az12/,2,r/ThunderBay,0,2

Oh, the truckers were always able to re-enter Canada if they had been permitted to go to the US... What they wanted was an exemption from the requirement to self isolate if they aren't vaccinated.   
SO nobody was preventing them from entering Canada.. They just don't get special treatment the rest of Canada doesn't have access to. 

The second half of your response shows the vastness of the depths of your complete and utter ignorance on science. 

The vaccines absolutely do reduce the chance of a person both becoming infected, and of spreading it if they do get infected. Even with Omicron. The efficacy of the vaccines against Omicron is reduced, NOT eliminated. SO anyone claiming that the vaccines don't impact spread is just plain lying. 

And reduces the chance of spread is not saying it prevents it.. So that claim is nothing more than a straw man fallacy.

"Not if the emergency never ends.

Look how easily the government was able to enact unprecendented legislation to gain emergency powers for a protest and blockade that was basically already over.

Germany declares war on Canada, Terrorists kidnap and murder politicians and set bombs off, and neurotic Ottawa residents on edge over honking and protesting.  One of these things is not like the other.

The fact of the matter is that the government enacted emergency powers to punitively punish people
it had zero legal ability to do otherwise.  The government had all the legal means already at their disposal to break up the protest, and send these people home.  

What they didn't have a right to do was interfere in normal Canadians lives without due process, simply because they exercised their fundamental freedoms of expression; seizing property a d bank accounts, under the guise of, ""fighting crime.""

Well guess what, the evidence is in, literally no evidence that anyone who donated to the convoy or any sort of donation to the convoy was illegal or suspicious.  That was the official finding of Finntrac.

The message was clear: if you disagree with Justin Trudeau, don't even think of exercising your right to dissent and democratically protest his decisions, or your life will
be torn apart, and we'll starve you.  That's the kind of shit that goes on in Russia, now we have to face that reality here.  That tyrannical bullshit gets nothing but applause from the rabble who can't see how that could possibly affect them.

">The first goal was to overthrow the government and put themselves in power. That was proven in the first version of the MOU.

Show me where it says that.  Explain to me how it was supposed to work.  These truckers were just going to to storm parliament and replace all of our elected MPs and we were all going to just have to agree to it?

Also, it did change from truckers not being able to cross the border, but shortly after Canada implemented its policy, the US followed suit, and non-truckers joined in.  Many of whom opposed compelled vaccination, and the discrimination against unvaccinated people.

The way unvaccinated people were being treated was out of some distopian science fiction novel.  Being treated as if they were, ""dangerous,"" ""unclean,""  or shudras,  when in fact they were simply more vulnerable to suffer from it, and it was the vaccinated who posed a bigger threat to them than they were a threat to anyone else.  People still believe that the vaccine prevents people from catching or spreading covid, and these same idiots were at the forefront of shitting on anyone who didn't agree with their flawed assessment.

Now no masks, no more passports, so are we
supposed to just forget about how horrible and neurotic Canadians acted towards each other?  Maybe not because we're not over it.

"Part of the issue is that they have been working without a contract for some time, and they can not agree on the type of arbitration.  

The union announced Monday that professors, instructors, librarians and counsellors will stage a full walk-out starting Friday unless the College Employer Council agrees to binding interest arbitration of the remaining issues.

Binding interest arbitration would allow a neutral person to impose a compromise between the two parties' positions.

That's a non-starter for the CEC, which insists on final offer selection arbitration, under which the arbitrator would choose one of the proposals in its entirety.

""If the union is satisfied that its offer is reasonable, then it should allow an arbitrator to choose between it and the CEC offer,"" said Graham Lloyd, the CEO of the College Employer Council.

They found Fort William to be full of sin, and so to prove the power God had granted them, they took off their clothes and marched through the pool halls and other dens of sin.

"Crawford street witch house. All manner of spooky shit was shared in rumor.

It's an empty lot now but before that it was a condemned home with no running water or electricity where three sisters with dementia lived. You could smell the house for blocks. I remember the city finally intervened and there was a hazmat team involved. A basement full of human waste because the toilet doesn't flush and so many feral cats. A couple senile old ladies who were in and out of the LPH called it home.

Another legend, the pools of standing water with the dead grass covering the playground of St. Anns school every spring thaw smelled that way because the school was built over an old landfill/sewage dump.

Kids used to claim the lakers that used to park at the swing bridge were disguised warships.

The log chute slides at centennial, a kid got his fingernail caught on the way down and it ripped his finger off.

Tales of the horror named Skidorski at the bluffs.

Nearly every single pool in town had ""That kid who got his intestines' sucked out"" (It's a Chuck Palahniuk story)",t2_db229vj6,stronzoinbiceletta,0,1647440335.0,0,t1_i0vyd1a,i0vyd1a,True,MilesOfPebbles,t3_tf0qib,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tf0qib/what_are_some_of_your_thunder_bay_related/,What are some of your Thunder Bay -related conspiracy theories and/or legends?!,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tf0qib/what_are_some_of_your_thunder_bay_related/i0vyd1a/,6,r/ThunderBay,0,6

"It really doesnt make a difference to me - and I work in agriculture (the people daylight savings time is supposedly for) but where I work it's not for market. 

If it's 6-7 it doesn't matter, I'm getting up a few hours before sun up and I'm at the greenhouse by sunrise.

Its actually a detriment to lose an hour of morning sunlight for market farmers. It means they have less harvesting time to make it to the market on time. Saving daylight for a farmer would be giving another hour the other way, so that way you could wake up earlier and have more time after the heat of the day makes harvesting not ideal to go get stuff done, make deliveries etc while businesses are open.

It's a pretty stupid tradition and while I like getting the extra hour in winter it's really not helping anythung because my work will just adjust to align with the sunlight that actually exists",t2_4e6lsxw9,shiddytclown,0,1647434194.0,0,t1_i0vleak,i0vleak,True,Fantastic_Platypus,t3_tfdt2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tfdt2l/support_for_move_to_central_time_if_daylight/,Support for move to Central time if daylight savings becomes permanent?,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tfdt2l/support_for_move_to_central_time_if_daylight/i0vleak/,1,r/ThunderBay,0,1
