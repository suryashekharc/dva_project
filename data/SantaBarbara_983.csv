(If it wasn't a desert there would not be tarantulas,  roadrunners and coyotes literally at the coast along the 101.

The problem is the areas had reservoirs designed for the populations of the 50s 60s and 70s.

"Hey! Thanks for the response. I’m looking to run this as often as I can, my schedule is a bit flexible since I’m not doing much with my free days, but since I work under contract I can accommodate to a particular groups schedule. To be honest weekly is a bit tough since I do have other compromises through out the month, but nothing that I wouldn’t be able to work around. It be fun to keep it at least once a month for a solid 4 hour session. The size of the group I’m looking for would optimally be 4-8. 8 characters though are a lot to track as a newbie dm but if everyone is also as much as a beginner as I am then I hope we could all use it as a learning experience. 

I do have a solid grasp on how the game is supposed to work, but only because I play Pillars of Eternity, Baldurs Gate and other stuff on Steam. I have no issues running low level adventures for complete beginners as I too consider myself one. Plus it’s mostly about the fun I think. And yes I’d allow the full use of digital characters as I have all access on DnDbeyond and would be totally open to share what I have on there. I wouldn’t know how to dm without some digital help. Other than that I like using Discord to keep track of sessions. Super easy to set up. As for the game itself, I have a ton of dice, a ton of flat minis and tokens, quick reference print outs for the party to have handy, a ton of high quality maps and eventually I was thinking of getting a tv installed on my table to use digital dynamic maps. I don’t mind digital dice rolls either. 

Hope that answers most of your questions and please let me know if anything else pops into mind!

Edit: for character creation DnDbeyond point buy system is the easiest for sure. Also my table can only sit 6 comfortably.

"We (Santa Barbara) don't get any water from the Colorado river. We get the vast majority of our water from the Santa Ynez river watershed, i.e. rainfall on the mountains just north of us. That's augmented with some supplies from local groundwater, desalination, and some State Water Project water, a giant aquiduct carrying water from the Sacremento and Feather rivers in Northern California.

Even in parts of CA that do get water from the Colorado river aquiduct, it's generally not the majority supply. Claremont (east of LA), for instance uses about 1/3 Colorado River water, 1/3 State Water Project water (from northern CA), and 1/3 local groundwater. 

The information on water planning in California is all publically available; please do some research before scaremongering.

""A lot has changed in desalination technology since the plant was built in 1991.

The reactivated plant…

Uses 40 percent less energy than the original design, greatly reducing its electricity demand and carbon footprint, by using high-efficiency pumps, motors, and improved filter technology.

Uses ocean intake pipes equipped with wedge wire screens recognized by the State Water Resources Control Board as a best available technology for screened open ocean intakes.  The screens are made of durable copper-nickel alloy and have one millimeter openings to minimize marine life entrapment and impingement.

>This latest cut will affect even the water agencies and big farming operations north of the Delta from which Stokes has purchased “supplemental” water during past droughts. Those supplemental water supplies — which were shipped south through the vast spiderweb of pipes and pumps that have made the State Water system invaluable even when it had little water to spare — saved Santa Barbara’s bacon during the last drought. Now it appears the last drought and the current drought are part of what meteorologists describe as one big “mega-drought.”

>Statewide, the drought is changing the face of California agriculture. The Washington Post reported that 400,000 acres of California ag-land are now lying fallow because of the drought, resulting in an estimated loss of $1.1 billion and 9,000 jobs.

>Little wonder Governor Gavin Newsom authorized the expenditure of $22.8 million on drought emergency measures, mostly to preach the gospel of conservation. In Santa Barbara, however, city residents are already using about 25 percent less water today than they were in 2013.

"Mon - Thur: Outdoor Courts at UCSB \~5:30PM, has lights, \~6 courts on blacktop of various condition. Not great courts but can be competitive when there's not full teams of college freshmen. 

Mon - Thur: Outdoor at Girsh Park \~ 5:30PM, no lights (OK w/ daylight savings time now), only 2 courts but better condition than UCSB outdoor. 

Sat: Outdoor at Girsh Park \~12:00. Very busy. Skill level more varied than UCSB crowed and mixes in more old head types. This run seems to be by far the most active in the SB / Goleta / IV area. 

I haven't played indoor yet but UCSB has community passes for their rec center at $65/month or $20/day use, 2 courts. Mask mandate recently dropped and should be back open to non students. 

Paige Center has rentable courts for private runs, or open gym for $5/use but that's weekdays 10am-2PM.

YMCA on Hitchcock has 1 (edit: 2!) indoor court(s). I suspect that will be the only real indoor run in Santa Barbara proper but hopefully a member can confirm that here. Mask mandate was only recently dropped so may not be consistent yet anyways.

Still need to put in double paned windows and replace the rotted-out deck, but we both need a break from the construction.

Everything cost at least twice what I expected. Usually had to call several vendors before getting one to call back.

I know this is not what you asked but pasta is incredibly easy to make.  You don't even need to measure ingredients...just a well of flour and eggs.  Roll out with a pin or even a wine bottle.  Cut with a knife into as thin as you want.  Boil for 3 minutes in salted water and you will be very happy.   Watch a couple videos and try it every day this week and by the weekend you'll be an expert and will have spent less than a single portion of store bought fresh pasta.,t2_5ikby,el_smurfo,0,1648095850.0,0,t1_i1w4nck,i1w4nck,True,spoookyskelly,t3_tlrffn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/tlrffn/fresh_pasta_store/,Fresh pasta store?,/r/SantaBarbara/comments/tlrffn/fresh_pasta_store/i1w4nck/,11,r/SantaBarbara,0,11

I have the option for remote vs not-remote (though the latter is strongly encouraged) and have a potential offramp to an arrangement for 1-2 days per week in-office.

I think Clinton was the most popular president ever according to ratings.

And they did it to bail out Silicon Valley from losing the value of their stock options.

Not that you can lay blame solely with Democrats because every President since then has done the same thing with central bank policy. Trump and Biden both took part in printing 40% of the money in existence in a one year period between '20-'21 and now everyone is scratching their head wondering why groceries cost 20% more and housing went up 40% in some areas.

A lease agreement is a written contract between you and the landlord that specifies a certain amount of time, generally 12 months, that you agree to live there and pay rent. As the end of that term approaches, decide whether you'd like to stay. You have the right to not renew your lease and no legal reason compels you to renew.

"I don't think it was framed that way. For most of the public the question is...do you want lower taxes? Then someone like Regan decides to stop subsidies to state governments for mental health facilities and increase defense budget spending. The question isn't put to them in the way you frame it.

And for people that vote for lower taxes, they're thinking is that even if I vote to pay this, will this money go to mental health care? You and I both know it becomes a shell game. Sure...California lottery was supposed to be this huge boom in funding for schools. That's the way it was sold during the ballot measure. But all they did was cut funding for schools from other places. Lottery money isn't ""extra"" for the schools. 

State of California could have tried to keep those facilities going without federal subsidies. 

I don't think it's getting solved. If people don't want to be on their meds and the ACLU is going to give them free legal assistance to dodge that, we can't stop it. It's sad. I don't get the argument that they aren't of sound mind so can't be held liable for assaulting people on the streets when they're freaking out, but *sound enough* to make a decision to not be on medication.

In addition to the ACLU garbage, we also get stuck in this batshit crazy funding crap which leads to dark places. It goes something like this...""Oh...you're opening a new mental health facility and have a huge government budget? Well how about giving these people ten pills instead of just two? Increases our profits."" You know it happens. Just look up the body brokerage business for these drug rehab facilities in Florida. I know of a few cities that are now allocating half their beds in homeless shelters to pedophiles because the money they get paid from the government for sheltering and managing that population is greater than what they would get for housing a working poor homeless cleaner for example.

"There are only a few posts that get locked as redundant, but it's an idea that is being discussed, and as you saw there's occasional action. I do agree that there are a lot of the same sort of posts that we get with some frequency (and it's not even peak wedding season yet) but they don't get reported and users do seem to like to respond to them. Most threads that get moderation are ones that are reported (like all the Chick Fil A threads (and it doesn't seem to me because people hate Chick Fil A or conservatives, but because users seem to be tired of the same conversation)).

There are no subreddit rules against the date night, weekend visit, etc... posts. Nor are there subreddit rules against redundant threads, but users have requested that redundant threads get combined (which moderators can not do) so next best is to choose one thread and lock the others (like in the instance of an earthquake, or rocket launch, or similar). If you, or anyone, has ideas for ways to enhance the rules, or ways to enhance the subreddit, you are absolutely free to message the moderators whenever you want.

In the case of the locked thread, the way to get the moderators to reconsider locking it would be to message the moderators. Opening a thread asking the same isn't the preferred way to have a direct conversation with the moderators. That said, open conversations about the state of the subreddit are always welcome. Moderators are here to make this subreddit enjoyable for all users (and of course to enforce reddit rules), so if the users want a change that will help everyone enjoy the subreddit more that would be great.

It's not that interesting. It's nearly impossible to get a slip - like someone said the list was so long I think it even was closed at some point? So the easiest way to get a slip is to buy a boat that comes with a slip. So since there are not currently a lot of house boats in the harbor you'd have to buy a live aboard slip (even less of those that normal ones) that has a boat that's for sale with the slip. Then you'd have to get rid of that boat. Then you'd have to buy or purchase a houseboat and have it brought to Santa Barbara. It's just an expensive pain in the ass so it keeps more people from doing it.,t2_48pz0eml,saltybruise,0,1647956458.0,0,t1_i1nrf07,i1nrf07,False,ghostface8081,t3_tjpvc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/tjpvc1/can_anyone_tell_me_about_the_brown_houseboat_in/,Can anyone tell me about the brown houseboat in the Harbor?

"As a local business owner, I don’t agree with anything you are saying. It’s made up nonsense.

There are plenty of thriving businesses outside of upper state and Costco. Just because you like shopping on upper state doesn’t mean, that is the only place to shop. If what you said is true, we would have little to no retail outside of those areas.

What other businesses have we allowed to be “run off” and what did the city do to make them leave? I’m not aware of any.

You keep saying that people are targeting CFA unfairly because they are a religious organization, but I’m not convinced that is the case.  I honestly believe that a lot of people here have nothing better to do than to make a mountain out of a mole hill.

It is apparent though that there are several people who are very pro CFA, and I’m not sure why.  Maybe you and the others are employees there? Even though you are on the other side, you also seem to be trying to making a mountain out of a mole hill by making hyperbolic statements.

"Chick fil A is, at most, a traffic problem.   

It is disturbing that a law-abiding locally-owned business with a legal permit to do business, that has not exceeded their business plan or mission and that has made a good-faith effort to remedy any unintended consequences can simply be “declared a public nuisance” by the government and shut down.

"Well, yeah. I'm afraid to say anything not dripping in progressive rhetoric or just benign ""where can I get dessert in SB"", isn't going to be here. We all know that inclusive is only inclusive of just one viewpoint. Inclusive doesn't mean what websters says it does anymore. I consider myself a liberal, but to any progressive out there these days, I'm a racist karen who wears sheets at night and burns crosses.

There isn't going to be any ""reasonable"" discussion. The businesses know it . No one supports them. If they talk about what's happening downtown with broken windows and drugs and not being able to run a business, they're criticized. That's why a lot of them have just given up and left.

And let's be real. It's not getting solved. Half of them need to be in mental facilities and on medication and the ACLU always sues to keep them out of those places and off their meds. You can open more shelters and more people are just going to get put on buses for us to absorb. And a good deal of them don't want our solutions. They like the drugs and the street life and the hustle.  None of them are looking for the 9-5 job and a mortgage path of life. It's not like they're out there begging for rehab. A lot of them say they do because hey...it's great to yo-yo and get the opportunity to reset your habit to zero. But most of those dudes out there aren't looking to get clean forever.   


The best that can be done is to manage it. Keep the drug use and tents and violence out of the city centre. Keep them from running off businesses, ruining people's neighbourhoods, robbing and assaulting folks. But those people aren't getting ""fixed"". it's suicide to let SB become like San Francisco and Portland, but I'm sure you're aware that most of city council now sees that as a perfectly acceptable social justice oriented approach. Somehow it's now kind to let someone mentally ill and half naked roll around and write on her body all day.

"There have been incidents at UCSB lately of men trying to pull women into cars. Is this related?

I'm hearing that some of the children fleeing from Ukraine are being abducted by gangs for the slave trade. The chaos is such an opportunity for those gangs. I am not surprised by this though. I guess it was a huge issue when the USSR fell. If you can track down this old movie called Lilya 4-Ever it pretty much breaks down how bleak it was. They estimate 20% of women and children in some of the former soviet countries disappeared into the sex trade after the USSR fell. Unfortunately I can only find this weird summation of LIlya on youtube. It's a very powerful, but bleak movie.

"Fuck that’s so awful it’s just happening everywhere…it’s so bad here, since CA is one of the top 4 states for human trafficking and the 101 goes basically the whole length of the state SB is a perfect hub between SF & SD. Just between 2012-2014 there were 45 confirmed child survivors of domestic trafficking (80% were locals) : that’s from SBACT.com. There’s SO many websites and stats that come up when you google “Santa Barbara human trafficking”

From last month, Feb 2022 Santa María Times:

(this is specific to Santa Bárbara County)
“Sting operations between Feb. 9 and 12 by the task force — comprised of the Santa Barbara County District Attorney's Office, Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office, and Santa Barbara and Santa Maria police departments — resulted in the arrest of 14 alleged sex buyers, Zick said.”

&

“Over 80 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies throughout California participated in this year's Operation Reclaim and Rebuild, resulting in the rescue of 73 juvenile and adult victims and arrest of 477 individuals for crimes associated with human trafficking.”

I personally know of 2 women who were almost abducted, both attempts were made in the parking garage beneath Paseo Nuevo by men in vans.

"Tell me about this human trafficking problem. I was not aware. I thought places like Denver were bad because it was a trucking hub. I don't know why SB would be a human trafficking hub. Disturbing.

I'm from NZ/Aus. It's bad down there because of legal prostitution. The people moving bodies around the world just are able to layer in the illegal with the legal trade pretty easily. The legal trade actually made it much easier because they could set up permanent shop and just move them in and out from apartment to brothel and never let them out of sight and have a place with a steady stream of patrons.  They'll have a stable of regular girls that keep up their legal front for authorities to inspect and then quietly slip in another dozen they've moved in from Korea that are trafficked.  Its really bad for the girls from North Korea. They're trafficked all over the world to keep the dictator in office. Its one of NK's sources of revenue. Always pushed to service more and more units or threatened with their families starving. I am not sure they ever get out. Lots of talk that eventually they get sold for their organs.

I'm downtown on state a lot. If you're not down there early, you might miss how bad the drug and street life issues are. 6 am and it is skid row on a smaller basis. The shooting up, nodding off, pooping in the streets, abuse of employees. SB has always had some homeless problem because of the nice weather. Never seen the level of violence like I do now. I can tell you from experience that what tends to happen is the people that are violent, making disturbances are a nuisance in one area like LA or Denver, eventually just kind of get given a bus ticket to some other city like SB. Especially after a shelter is opened. It's like ""Oh...SB just opened a shelter. Put them on a bus. Eventually they'll get taken into custody and maybe they'll have space in their shelter"".People talk about high housing costs as part of the homeless problem. But none of the people living downtown and doing drugs was ever living and working in SB and then fell out to the streets because of high housing costs. None of them are from here. Lots of disingenious manipulation happening around those conversations. The folks living in their cars between apartments... yes. Not most of what you see downtown though.

"I am not sure what you mean by houseboat as people seem to have a variety of definitions. u/saltybruise posted some pics of a floating house but it doesn't really fit my mental image of a houseboat. I always thought there was a bit more emphasis on the BOAT part. But I always wanted a floating house like MacGyver had for a few seasons.

But seeing those pics got me interested in looking into the rules concerning liveaboards in the SB harbor. From my quick dive into the SB municipal code concerning the harbor (https://qcode.us/codes/santabarbara/?view=desktop&topic=17) , it looks like after September 9, 1980 every vessel was required to be operable. If they weren't operable at the time (defined as ""A vessel’s ability to maneuver safely under its own power from any place in the Harbor District to the open waters of the Pacific Ocean and back to its point of origin."") they could be grandfathered in. It also appears that if the vessel or slip changes hands, the vessel must then be brought up to meet the standard of operable. At any time the Waterfront Director can ask an owner to prove their vessels operability.",t2_bnxqn,SBRedneck,0,1647910164.0,0,t1_i1lqo54,i1lqo54,True,ghostface8081,t3_tjpvc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/tjpvc1/can_anyone_tell_me_about_the_brown_houseboat_in/,Can anyone tell me about the brown houseboat in the Harbor?

">	It’s a pain in the ass to stop every couple hundred yards for intersections when Modoc and the bike lane on it have right of way and don’t need to stop, and, on the safety comment, every intersection and driveway has effectively become a doubled stop for cars teeing into Modoc, where they now have to stop once to check for bike path traffic, move forward ten feet, stop to check Modoc traffic while blocking the bike path, and then make their turn onto Modoc. Simply put, I don’t trust drivers to safely and consistently do this.

"I was so excited for that rink to open then had a look through the windows and am super disappointed. Unless they're planning for a huge rink upstairs that you can't see, the roller skating area is a super tiny kid rink in the back of the first floor next to a large food court looking place. Like really small. Maybe the size of a carousel, but oval. One or two big beams in the middle of that as well.  A lot of it seems to be mostly focused on renting out laser tags up front, so don't think the upstairs *is* going to be a big rink. Think that will be their laser tag space.  I hope I'm wrong, but it didn't look promising. My roller disco dreams have been crushed.   


In any case, I've seen the owners boyfriend downtown once or twice and heard it was maybe June? Hook and Press isn't opening until summer either. They thought they'd be open by the new year  after leaving that space across from the museum in fall. I guess the city makes it hard. Can you imagine paying rent for almost a full year before you can open doors?

"There isn't really anywhere in SB that is bad or dangerous by the standards of most places.  Relatively speaking, many people would probably consider that area less ""nice"" than most parts of town.  But unfortunately some of that is likely just due to prejudice.

It's probably true that there is more gang activity there than in other parts of town, but ""more"" means like one or two incidents per year instead of zero.  Also, almost all the gang violence seems to be contained within gangs.  It would be quite unusual to hear about a random passerby with no gang ties being attacked or anything like that.  So realistically it is still pretty safe for people who aren't themselves affiliated with gangs.

In a lot of ways it's an interesting and vibrant neighborhood.  It's just not the ""white picket fence surrounding a manicured garden"" vibe that people tend to envision when they think of a ""nice"" neighborhood.

As far as objective facts go, that lower Westside area is the post densely populated part of town.  This means it can be tough to find parking if you don't get an apartment that has off-street parking.  Location-wise it is fairly close to downtown; you have to cross the freeway but there are street over/underpasses and a pedestrian footbridge at Anapamu Street.

"I’m Adam and yes I know it’s not pc but they robbed me and stripped us of our number and the spineless Ryan Howe  didn’t do it to my face but while I was battling complications with a  nasty Sebaceous Cyst the size of a softball that nearly killed me. Thats when he decided to show his truest colors. He put my main guy Skinny in a bind by borrowing money from his nephew and not repaying him, then in my absence Tearing my character to shreds due to necessity and keep in mind the worst part of Covid-19  when uncertainty and doubt plagues the country. He stolen our phone number, and a lot of our IP. 

Coincidentally at the time little did I know he and others in the SB area had a much more sinister plan. They paid city officials  and people in the planning department in the City of Goleta to keep us trapped in the red tape. A nightmare of red tagging before we ever had one thing done not typically the process to Run out the day the app was submitted to inspect building code for a plan that somehow this red tagged mezzanine plans are just lost. So out of the 100’s of pages transferred in from Sb County when Goleta became its own city. Though we found this odd we pressed on. Everything in order but what happened next is truly shady,  our plans all of them are lost not 1 time but 6 freaking times the plans are lost lost simply vanished 

This has gone on well we were the first to apply that wasn’t a walk in dispensary and our state license is M10-2018-000074  still not granted not for lack of anything more than the city seeing what’s going on and intervening. 
We gave back till it hurt everyone who knows us knows this these are true villains and we have been slighted. We pray someone who has a little give a damn about Us and Green Cuisine to help us we have been bled completely dry of funds and they seemingly have won. I know the power of God and the power of prayer if we can get only a prayer from y’all to right the wrongs and if anyone knows a lawyer the Canopy owes us enough money to get us back in action so any lawyers law students anyone who can help and get paid when we win I’m down to go the distance we literally were robbed while I lay on my death bed and though not in good taste I put that on my site with hope. 

Sorry for the book but we tithed to the needy and gave blessing to many with our abundance. These guys and “Local” are one in the same btw Ryan has also partnered to some degree with the guys from Coastal in a shop by Target in Goleta.

Its those kind off anti capitalist attitudes that destroy a community. Landlords and property owners provide a service to people that need housing. If you think you can steal from because they are wealthy thats wrong minded. Theft is theft no matter who the victim is or who the perpetrator is. If you support this kind of theft from property owners by the state and county you are supporting a decline in future investment in the county and state.

"Agreed.

There’s a particularly egregious gaggle of overindulged juveniles who congregate with their pricy e-bikes, generally, at State and De La Guerra. They’re reckless. I’ve seen them damage city property.

"My opinion as both a Dutch-American and avid cyclist is that there is a threshold of connected paths necessary to make bicycle transportation feasible for the general public. The Dutch system is excellent at this: bikes largely have priority at intersections, paths go everywhere, and they are all connected. 

We have more paths now than ten years ago, but they are largely isolated stretches and “secret” bridges connecting neighborhoods, which are great for avid cyclists like me who just kind of go exploring, but not great for casual user adoption. While a step in the right direction, even the new modoc path has a major flaw that makes it so I will continue to take the on-road bike lane: they located it on the south side of Modoc. What this means is that it crosses several cross streets where the bike path has its own little stop signs, and many driveways with limited visibility. Every one of these is both a safety hazard and an inconvenience. It’s a pain in the ass to stop every couple hundred yards for intersections when Modoc and the bike lane on it have right of way and don’t need to stop, and, on the safety comment, every intersection and driveway has effectively become a doubled stop for cars teeing into Modoc, where they now have to stop once to check for bike path traffic, move forward ten feet, stop to check Modoc traffic while blocking the bike path, and then make their turn onto Modoc. Simply put, I don’t trust drivers to safely and consistently do this. 

As someone who has biked tens of thousands of miles all around the world, this design is asinine. It should have been located on the north side to minimize intersections.",t2_9oci4zqp,mountainsunsnow,0,1647755667.0,0,t1_i1dgqjb,i1dgqjb,False,RexJoey1999,t3_thz6oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/thz6oc/measuring_the_equity_of_bicycling_in_santa/,Measuring the Equity of Bicycling in Santa Barbara - The Independent,/r/SantaBarbara/comments/thz6oc/measuring_the_equity_of_bicycling_in_santa/i1dgqjb/,8,r/SantaBarbara,0,8

"I guess the elected officials like to talk and not provide  real solutions. 

Do you not understand that the idea of affordable housing that your government has been unable to provide while giving it lip service correlates with an infringement on property owners rights to seek market value rents for their property instead of having a hidden rent cap based on a false enactment of state of emergency law?

This type of political pandering just makes things worse. And here is how, while I could rent my property to a long term renter and deal with this bullshit and be accused of pushing my rent past 10% of 2017 values and deal with all the other lack of property right CA tenant laws impose. Im more likely to rent my property as a vacation rental, make more money off of tourists, and not have to deal with secret rent caps…and for the community its one less property that could be on the market for a long term renter only making the situation worse - by disrespecting property owners you are disincentivizing future investment and future investment in the community

"While, yes, tribalism has always existed, Racism has not and is actually a relatively new idea. The idea that humans are different “races” based on phenotypical traits such as skin color and eye shape didn’t really get rolling as a “scientific” concept until the enlightenment age. The concept of race was then used to justify the brutal colonization and enslavement of other humans while espousing that “all men are created equal”. 

Our country, while being built on beautiful ideals, was also built on the profit gained from the the theft, the enslavement, and the genocide of tens of millions of people. To deny this is to deny basic historical facts. 

And to say racism in the United States is overblown is laughable and shows another real lack of understanding of our history, as well as how history affects present realities. It seems you could use some of those CRT classes that you so loathe (and that are absolutely not being taught to kindergartners). 

Teaching little ones to humanize each other so they don’t grow to hate and fear what is different, so that they don’t become “tribal” is a worthwhile endeavor. Unless you think humanity is not capable of learning from the past and becoming better as a species?

"The institution of slavery in the US was vastly different from types of slavery that proceeded it - being racially based and slaves being held in perpetuity. Only 6% of Africans forced across the Atlantic ended up in the United States. And yet by 1860 two thirds of all slaves in the New World were in the American South. Nothing really quite compares to the system that existed in United States. Slavery was enshrined in the US constitution for almost a century, and the failure of Reconstruction ensured that it continued even when it wasn't (in fact Hitler looked to America's Jim Crow as inspiration for his vision of Germany).

"It seems all too convenient that she confused teacher resources as being mandatory curriculum for students. Her arguments are dishonest and not made in good faith.

I highly suggest you read Caste by Isabel Wilkerson if you are interested in learning more. Wilkerson’s metaphor of society being like a play is especially poignant in helping answer your question. “The costumes were handed out at birth and can never be removed. The costumes cue everyone in the cast to the roles each character is to play and to each characters place on the stage.” -Isabel Wilkerson

From what I have read in the Independent, he is not big on transparency where the citizenry wants it, like, in connection to the public release of cam footage and/or audio from deputy involved shootings, or alleged mishandling (read: beating) of detainees by deputies. He stands behind his deputies, some might say to a fault. He's not the most progressive man, by report or reputation.

Ironically, he’s also pissed off the 2nd amendment crowd because he can be ""selective"" about the folks he grants concealed carry licenses to. I have no dog in that fight, but my buddies who do tell me he gives them out in ways that curry favor. Billy is said to be a bit of a Good Ol' Boy...

There's the handling of the prison issue someone else mentioned. Hard to be fair, because we really did need a new jail due to overcrowding. I cannot speak to that issue anymore than that, just how it's made some locals feel.

"I can try.  But it will be over your head.  Each culture / race prospers over others for a period of time.  No one really knows why.  Probably a mixture of good weather in a certain region for some time more then others.  The society outpacing the other society in technology or Discovery that gives them the edge.  

 Example: How much more powerful of a tribe / race the one that harnessed the power and mystery of Fire in cave man days.   We take such knowledge today of course for granted how big of a game changer that could have been for hundreds or thousands of years.  I do know the ones that did figure it out first were dominant over the rest because let's get real fire was a big fucking deal for man.  You can cook food , light , heat ward off animals, make and forge weapons.  Your tribe would very quickly become the strongest. 

Nature is fucking violent. Man has been in the bush a hell of a lot longer then he has been in a car or office.  His tribe his people his gang his race was what it took to survive and thrive. 

 The instinct and comfort of being around people that look like you act like you , eat the same food you were brought up on , hell even smell kinda like you.   That primal bond is not going away over night because a few days it's not right for one to be dominant on another. 

 Ok that's fair enough.  Sounds good on paper.  In practice the human will pick his tribe his instinct tells him too.   You deep down think the same way. You just don't want to admit it.  Because you are a human and you are closer to that bush and mud hut then you think.

It's the reason we walk by someone and in one second know what tribe that other human is from. You don't even have to think about it.   

Now heres the kicker.  Who's to say that tribe with the fire first was not black?  It's pretty much agreed on that blacks are physically dominant. Speed , strength, height.  Traits needed in the bush more.   I can guarantee at one point blacks were the dominant humans. It could have been for thousands of years.   
Examples: Gangis Kahn and his army of Asias we're the dominant tribe for a long time. Conquered the most territory ever.  

 No white man has come close to his success.  So much that I think something like 2% of the worlds population can be linked to the Kahn family.   

Then for a while the browns in the middle east were dominant. Egypt and Iraq were the fertal land. The rise of the Persian empire.  Pyramids and all that stuff.  Probably built by white slaves.  

The. It was the Romans turn.  I would argue that the Romans are not necessarily white as you would think today.  Mediterranean is darker.   

Then it was Spain's turn with Portugal.  I could go on and on all day.    The thing that is constant is change.  The white man for some reason has been dominant in this part of time right now.   You just happened to be alive in the time. I would argue tho that his time did peak and most likely on the decline now.  Birth rates and other things.   If I was a betting man I think it's time for Asian domination again.   

Who knows the next tribe turn could be black again.    

The whole point is.  If you are brown, black , yellow or whatever.  You are not innocent. Not one ounce.  Because given the chance you would take the lead too and don't even try and tell me any different.

Ooo brother. Funny that you talk about learning history and made the statement that the civil war was not entirely over slavery.  It was much more a war started over economic imbalances and states rights.  The northern states were a lot more wealthy then the south. Banking and finance was mostly in the north.  The south felt cheated and wanted to split and try there own .  To add to the economic war the north kinda used freeing slaves to hurt the south.  Losing slaves to the manual labor dependant South was much more of a blow to there economy then a banker in New York.  The north could not afford to loose the vital entrance to the Mississippi . Water highway of the nation at that time. The argument turned into shooting.  It was not two sides killing each other for the purpose of freeing a small percentage of the population.
