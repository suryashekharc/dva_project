"Absolutely!  Come hang out!  It's very chill.  It's just that in the 70's and 80's some developers started dosing our little bungalows and putting in apartments so we stopped it because it was killing our vibe.  ""Some"" people have started coming in and building rich houses up in the hills but for the most part we're still the older homes that just want to surf and hang.  Those older homes go for millions now because of the scarcity principle, but even the millionaires are just dudes in flipflops wanting to surf.  We are also currently fighting back against people that are wanting to convert this place to a rich neighborhood but unfortunately we're more split on that topic so some of the downtown construction is going away from beach town.  I think where we're heading is a rich-surfer future where all the kids have 3,000 electric bikes with surf racks and the adults are driving 100,000 kitted-out sprinter vans.  But we do not want to lose our little surf vibe.  We produce a lot of famous skaters and surfers because of our fight and we want to keep it that way.  But if we go super high density then we turn in something like La Jolla Shores where the beaches are so crowded that you can't even paddle out during the summer.

I actually worked on the flood control project for the San Luis Rey - flood risk was an issue because of an overgrowth of invasive arundo in the river  causing a decrease in max flow capacity. As in many places in Southern California a river may have extremely low flow until a rain event. Now for that area there is a maintenance plan in place now assuming the city keeps up with it. This is what is keeping the 100 year event status.

"idk, it seems like $1000 per year to cover a $700k+ home not a bad deal, even after 100 years, on the other hand, you could go the climate change route and presume a river in a desert getting more deserted.

or we could slice it like this $80 bucks a month is like 5 and a half hours of minimum wage per month spent assuring that once per 100 years you get a new house. when it's put like that, that sounds horrifying.

on the other hand, the fema website shows that area as having a 0.2% annual chance of flooding, or roughly 10x your chance of dying from covid, if you actually caught the original version, not the new variants that are 100x less likely to kill you.

"I have been biking through that field recently every couple of weeks.  Right now, it's a touch rough.  Nothing like a homeless guy with an off-leash pit bull to make you wonder if it was a wise path to pick.  But, that spot seems to be on the up and the parks that are connected to it are  really nice.  They keep it pretty clean, I haven't seen any Oceanside Scrub Brush (abandoned shopping carts).

Getting to the freeway on Melrose during rush hour is slightly easier than College.

"Been at that intersection for almost 4 years now and like it on the whole. I don't have any school aged children, so can't comment on the quality of the schools, but I love that the beach is easily and quickly accessible (relatively...I used to live in LA/SFV). As been mentioned, it's not really walkable...the closest ""food"" is the gas station mini mart LOL but on the upside, it's a 24-hour gas station & mini-mart. Lots of food options close-by down Oceanside Blvd, Santa Fe Ave, and Vista Way though.

Don't know your car situation, but B&D Auto is right there in case you have car trouble (Napa Auto Parts is there too if you're a DIY'er) which has saved me a few times. The Sprinter station is very close and I've never had any problems the few times I've waited for the train at 4:30 in the morning.

The biggest downside to me are those train tracks. The Sprinters are quiet and you probably won't notice them, but late night freight trains rumble through and blast their horns and can be disruptive depending on how lightly you sleep (and how insulated everything is). Also, for whatever reason, over the last 2-3 months loud cars/motorcycles have started racing up and down Melrose late at night.",t2_5s4l7but,DZRTwanderer,0,1647926060.0,0,t1_i1ml7bq,i1ml7bq,True,ezgot,t3_tjhksi,https://www.reddit.com/r/northcounty/comments/tjhksi/melrose_droceanside_blvd/,Melrose Dr/Oceanside Blvd?,/r/northcounty/comments/tjhksi/melrose_droceanside_blvd/i1ml7bq/,4,r/northcounty,0,4

I think that's the best way to go, find a hobby you enjoy or would enjoy and meet people there. Try to make sure it has a community aspect to it though. Things like the gym are usually more individual oriented people don't talk to strangers there much. In my experience at least.

"I mostly use the trains as part of my bike rides, so I am well aware how few folks are on the trains middays. But running smaller trains (fewer cars) more often would probably increase ridership.

Of course the Metrolink costs about 150% over the Coaster and Amtrak is about double what Metrolink charges, so maybe it is just that the Sprinter is a great deal.

"Here's an article about it. I think in all these cases they are looking at the parking areas. I see no reason you couldn't build over them. Also the buildings between the two parking lots, behind the Amtrak part, would be great with the addition of some shops and I think that a 3-4 story rooftop bar/restaurant that could see both the ocean and also the arriving and departing trains would be great. I take the trains often and would love to see the station have more of a San Juan Capistrano vibe than the vacant area where the homeless sort of take over in between train times. There is no reason to ever go to the station right now except to catch a train, and that seems like a missed opportunity. Also, I bet Carlsbad Village will be the toughest to get done.

"This article is hilarious. Especially with the included news story. 

The grade crossing horn rules are far more complicated than the news story made it out to be. 20 seconds before the crossing is only if you're going a less than 45 miles an hour.

GCOR 5.8.2) Furthermore, with multiple (3) crossings,  you have to basically be on the horn the whole time. 

Amtrak is a union job, locomotive engineers (conductors don't operate the train) bid for the trains based on seniority.

"San Elijo very much has a community feel from what I've seen (lots of driving through it, no time living there). A few notes from my limited knowledge: 

Some pros: 

* There is a fairly good-sized centralized park and good walking trails
* There are houses and townhomes in the area so probably different price point options for rent 
* The elementary and middle schools are close and tons of kids from the neighborhood walk to school (at least they do in the mornings when I'd see them on my commute) 

Some cons: 

* There aren't many small parks / playgrounds near houses 
* I don't think there are any community pools in the neighborhood. There may be closer pools than Alga Norte (15 min drive), but if there are I'm not sure where

"Both my kids (son and daughter) went to Lake recently and they loved it. My daughter went to their music program and loved it. Lake was one of the first schools doing in class teaching during Covid and did a great job following protocol and kept everyone safe. In the end it really depends on the individual teacher your children get. We were not too impressed with one of the kid's teacher in one of the grades but it all worked out fine.
I would for sure recommend Lake to other parents.especially the music program. I was a little concerned when I saw the rating. I am not sure how the rating works. 
Lake has good student diversity which in my mind is a good thing. But it can also affect overall test scores for the school. The only negative is the morning school drop off. It is a hassle getting in and out on time.
The principal did change this year so not sure how things will be in the future with new leadership.
Hope this helps.",t2_a3w93ip8,Adventurous-tri,0,1645322844.0,0,t1_hxnjlzr,hxnjlzr,True,parker19822,t3_swcxdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/northcounty/comments/swcxdd/any_opinions_on_lake_elementary_in_oceanside/,Any opinions on Lake Elementary in Oceanside?,/r/northcounty/comments/swcxdd/any_opinions_on_lake_elementary_in_oceanside/hxnjlzr/,3,r/northcounty,0,3

"Been living pretty close to that street for almost a year now. Overall it’s nice and I like having a bigger place and yard so no complaints there. 

One neighbor uses their house as a party rental and throws huge parties so the whole street gets to listen to their music until 2am. Professional DJ equipment etc so it gets loud. They’re renting and setting up porta potties on the street -type of parties so that tells you about the size of these parties.

Every week there’s a couple of lost dogs running around. I don’t know how people here don’t give a shit about their pets. I helped one dog home once and the owner didn’t seem to care much that their dog was running loose on the street.

First week we moved in a drunk driver hit a parked car on the street. A few months later a big armored SWAT-style police vehicle was doing a raid on a house down the street. And this winter I found a collapsed tent behind our fence, it was heavy when I moved it so for a second I thought there’s a body inside. Turned out to be a soaked sleeping bag and some other belongings. Who knows where the owner went.
