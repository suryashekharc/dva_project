They have a lot of extra programs that are totally unnecessary but focused on preventative measures, so an insured person can get help losing weight or learning about nutrition.

">	Could Delray Beach’s already buzzing downtown soon turn into a raucous party-scene resembling “New Orleans”? That’s the fear of some city officials as Delray Beach considers allowing bars to permanently operate outdoors.

>While only about a dozen bars in Delray Beach would be impacted, the concern is that it could open “Pandora’s Box” and create a domino effect of new outdoor bars coming to Delray Beach and bringing loud, boisterous partiers.

>While Delray Beach already has a vibrant downtown on Atlantic Avenue with patrons spilling out from restaurants and bars, the concern centers around the revelry from potential new bars infiltrating residential neighborhoods. The issue comes on the heels of the city’s prolonged battle with an outdoor bar, Studio 404, over frequent noise complaints from nearby residents.

>There’s been a long-standing rule for bars in Delray Beach: If you don’t serve food, you’re not allowed to operate outdoors. The city temporarily suspended the rule in 2020 due to COVID-19 so businesses could stay open in a safe manner.",t2_adg8b,FLTA,0,1647099372.0,0,t1_i0dm67c,i0dm67c,True,FLTA,t3_tcivaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/tcivaf/delray_beach_is_considering_letting_bars/,Delray Beach is considering letting bars permanently operate outdoors.

"Jupiter down to West Palm beach is where I would live. Anything north of Jupiter just really isn’t south Florida and has a different vibe.

Palm Beach Gardens is cool as well, I haven’t been here much except to go kayaking on the intracoastal.  
  
If you really want a lot of Asian markets and cuisine, the city of Sunrise and Weston has a lot. It’s like an hour south of what you said but there is a ton of good Asian food there. I know there’s a Chinese church in south Coral Springs, a few miles north of Sunrise. This will probably make you feel the best in terms of Asian communities.

"The further north you go, the less....metropolitan...the area. 

I live in Gardens. It's pretty middle class, some rich parts. Great beaches nearby with a short drive.

Groceries are plentiful at the plethora of Publixes etc.  My neighborhood is friendly, and I'm sure many others are as well.

Jupiter is a bit more rednecky than Gardens, especially in the boonies, but still nice. They try to keep it having the ""Small Village"" feel, but it's growing fast. Lots of food and restaurants. Schools are good.

Heading up to St. Lucie, etc. I'm not so sure about the culture, but everything feels much more spread out the further up the I95 corridor you go.

"Still missing - 

Vladek was living with my dad in East Orlando, my dad left town on 11/5/2021 with me and a couple other family members to go on a trip out of state for 10 days, Vladek elected to stay home. While my dad was gone he tried to check in with Vlad via texts and voicemails but he never answered any of them. When my dad got back into town Vladek wasn’t at the apartment so we filed the missing persons report with Orange County Sheriffs Office. The day we reported him missing my dad posted flyers…the maintenance guy from the apartment complex left my dad a voicemail saying he saw Vlad on 11/12/2021 and he spoke with Vlad…my dad is very hard of hearing so he thought the maintenance guy said that after they spoke he saw Vlad walk into the woods. So that is what dad relayed to the sheriffs office and is what is written in the initial report. But a few days later when my dad listened to the voicemail again, the maintenance guy had said he saw Vlad, they spoke a few minutes and as a side note he mentioned that he knew Vlad liked to hang out in the woods behind the basketball court to smoke/sing and said we should check there….not that he saw him walk into there. The area the maintenance guy was describing is a thin strip of woods and there was no evidence of him being there recently. We have been asking the sheriffs office to correct the information regarding his last sighting in their report/flyer they pass out because it is inaccurate and misleading but they have yet to do so.

In the year following up to when Vladek went missing, he spoke frequently about how eventually he wanted to go off and live in the woods but he said he wouldn’t do that until after my dad had passed away because he didn’t want to leave my dad alone or for him to be blamed by the family for him leaving.

We think Vlad left the apartment sometime between 11/12/21 and 11/15/21 because he was last seen on 11/12/21 by the maintenance guy. The odd thing about the story is that he stopped using his cell phone on 11/6/21, he had unread texts from that day forward. His phone was found dead in his room, the charger cord nearby.

While it appeared as if he left suddenly and did not bring anything. He successfully completed basic training and graduated from the Marines (he was honorably discharged later on). He has survival training. He could have traveled to a trail and began hiking or he could be camping near a trail.

Another theory is that he could have gotten wrapped up into a religious movement or cult. At the beginning of 2021 Vladek had a extreme switch in ideals. He had always been the type of person that strived to have the best phone,clothes,shoes….but at the beginning of 2021 he became hyper focused on Heaven, and very minimalistic…he began giving away money to the homeless and giving away possessions because he said they were distractions from Heaven. He made comments about how he wasn’t afraid of death because he would be in heaven, and that if he could be in heaven today he would. I’m a Christian but this was just a different level. 

There have been no reported sightings since 11/12/2021, my family is desperate for information regarding Vlad’s disappearance….we are worried about his safety and wellbeing 💔

Main points to note:

When my dad left for the trip he gave Vlad $100 and a credit card to use, the only transaction that has been made on that card was either the day my dad left or the following day (unclear which day due to how transactions post) for a cup of coffee at FoxTail

He shared a car with my dad, but the car was in the repair shop while my dad was out of town…he never used public transportation in the past and he was very bad with directions…didn’t have GPS on his flip phone….if he needed to get somewhere and my dad was using the car he would usually walk 

His phone was a basic flip phone that he only used for phone calls and text messages - he left that phone behind when he disappeared - all his texts were unread from 11/6/21 on…I went through the messages but didn’t come across anything helpful. 

He was not a student at UCF or any other nearby campus. However the apartment complex they live at is very close to UCF.

He was not working at the time of his disappearance. 

He didn’t have a girlfriend at the time of his disappearance that we are aware of. His only friend that he would have regular text communication with was someone that worked at one of the restaurants he frequented but that person he tried multiple times to reach out to him while my dad was gone and he didn’t get a response from him either.

He has a Facebook and Instagram but they are blank…he never posted on them/used them. There is a chance he could have used them for messaging but I can’t gain access to his accounts so I am unable to find that out.

He shared a laptop with my dad but he hadn’t used that in over a year.

His limited online presence was playing his PlayStation and watching YouTube videos via a smart TV, still trying to gain access to those accounts to see who he was following and if he was messaging anyone on those platforms 

He wasn’t into the party scene or drugs/alcohol….the most he has tried was weed

He is well recognized at the businesses/restaurants he would frequent on University Blvd, Alafaya Trail, and Waterford Lakes due to his generosity and friendly personality. He spent his free time helping people in need, he would give money to homeless individuals and have lunch with them/long conversations at restaurants and cover their check. He has a huge heart for people and will strike up conversations with people that he met, he wanted to make sure they felt heard and that they mattered. 

We adopted him and his biological sister, Irena, from Russia when he was 5 yrs old but he has no contacts with anyone there and never expressed a lot of interest in going back - the only thing I know about his biological parents is that they had a history of alcohol abuse.

He successfully graduated from the Marines bootcamp Dec 2018, he served a desk job for about 7-8 months before receiving an honorable discharge for failure to adapt - he said it was bringing up memories of his time in Russia. 

The night before my dad left for the trip he made comments to my dad about archangels and demons and how you have to be dark to kill the dark (I assume this is what he was listening to on YouTube)…it was all off the wall stuff that didn’t make a lot of sense. He bought a pocket knife a few days before my dad left…he said it was for protection…but the pocket knife was still in the apartment when my dad returned from the trip. 

He has never gone more than a day without reaching out to someone in the family. If he was in a right frame of mind at the time of his disappearance he would at least told his biological sister, Irena, that he is okay and not to worry - which he did not.

If he did decide to go off and do his own thing we are fine with that as long as he is mentally well and safe - we just don’t know….we just need to know that he is okay 💔

Ways you can help -

- We have created a Facebook group, Instagram, and TikTok page for him to help spread awareness and to keep others updated on any developments, @FindVladekHasel. Please join them and invite your contacts to join them….reshare his story/photo as much as you can. The more we get his story/photo out there the greater the chance someone will recognize him and come forward with more information.

- We are trying to get his story/photo out there as much as we can, if you know of any social media influencers or Podcasts that will share his story please do so. 

- We have created a fundraiser on Facebook for information leading to the safe rerun of Vladek. We are raising this money with the hopes of offering a reward or hiring a private investigator that can hopefully locate Vlad. Any help financially is greatly appreciated, Please share this fundraiser with your contacts as well. 

- What we have gathered is Vlad was at least listening to a YouTube pastor between Oct/Beginning of Nov 2021 that was putting a lot of focus on Heaven/archangels/Demons….we don’t know who this pastor was but if we can figure out that account it could give some insight into Vlad’s state of mind just before he disappeared. If you are aware of a YouTube pastor with these types of posts along that timeline please send us a message. 

- if you are hiking trails or working with the homeless community please memorize Vlad’s face incase you might come across him. 

- IF you think you see someone that resembles him please try to discreetly take a picture (If it is safe to do so) and send us a message of when and where the sighting was and call the non-emergency tip line for Orange County Sheriffs Office.

Thank you for anyway you can help with bringing answers to our family 💔 We love and miss him so very much 💔

"
>    Where in South Florida do you get the most for the money in terms of house ?

On the east coast (Miami/Lauderdale/Palm Beach) there are typically 3 options: Choose a smaller, older home in a old neighborhood; choose a newer development/town that is farther from the coast; live farther north (most often wherever you work it's cheaper to choose a home that is farther north, savings depends on how far you're willing to commute)


>    Looking on Zillow, there goes a lot of money in to the property tax. Is there a way to reduce the property tax somehow ? Is there anywhere in SF that has cheaper property tax than other places?

Minimize home purchase cost or potentially live in a county with lower tax rates. 

>    Any places in SF where you should absolutely not settle down, high crime rate, bad schools etc ?

Yes. SF is a huge area. You've got to narrow things down and check the local crime maps and school zoning. 

>    What kind of insurances do you need when living in SF ? House insurance, health insurance, car insurance etc. Know nothing about living in US. But heard you need insurance for everything.

If you purchase a home with a mortgage you will be required to have home insurance. Even you buy outright it's a good idea to have home insurance for liability/hazard/windstorm. You must have car insurance. Health insurance is crazy if you have to purchase for yourself. Ideally you should obtain health insurance through your employer. 

>    What is the normal price for Pool Guy once a week ? Company cutting your grass ? Is it worth it to have someone pay your lawn ?

I pay a pool guy $100 a month. I haven't shopped around so I don't know if this is normal. I pay my son $25 a week to mow. Before my son was old enough I always mowed myself. Whether it's worth it depends on how much you value you place on not doing it yourself. Grass and foliage grow quickly and consistently in SF so there's never much of a break. It's a weekly chore at least 40-45 weeks a year.",t2_5k164,big_deal,0,1644433814.0,0,t1_hw9g9wf,hw9g9wf,True,turboking207,t3_smcp0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/smcp0m/moving_to_south_florida_from_europe_general/,Moving to South Florida from Europe - General Questions,/r/SouthFlorida/comments/smcp0m/moving_to_south_florida_from_europe_general/hw9g9wf/,1,r/SouthFlorida,0,1

"I've lived in South Florida for 25 years and while others are somewhat jokingly saying to not move here because there are too many people, they are right.  South Florida is increasingly crowded and I've definitely seen an uptick in crime rates.  I just bought a house in Coral Springs and came from Cooper City.  Nonetheless, I'll try to answer your questions. 

1.  Getting the most house for your money is very subjective.  I bought a 24 year old house in a nice area of Coral Springs in a nice but non-gated community.  It is on 1/3 acre, 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, has a pool, and backs up to a nice lake.  I paid $660k.  I also searched for a house for about 2 years and got lucky.  Cash is king right now so don't expect to move here and buy a house unless you have either all cash or a very significant down payment.  I put 25% down.  All that said, in South East Florida, the general rule of thumb is the further north and west you go, the more you'll get for your money.  

2.  I bought my house a month ago and it's appreciated by almost $10k already.  That said, the general consensus is there will be a market correction eventually and I expect my house to take a 15%-20% dip in value within the next couple years.  

3. Property tax cost is subjective.  The nicer the area, the higher the taxes, for the most part.  My property taxes are about $5k but if I bought just 1/2 mile north in Parkland they would have been double that.  There's little you can do to mitigate that cost and if you buy a house that hasn't been sold in a decade or so, expect them to increase after you buy the house.   

4.  Once the seller accepts your offer you enter the inspection period.  Mine was 10 days but you can have less or more based on your offer.  Once inspected, you have the right to renegotiate with the seller if repairs are needed or you can back out of the deal entirely.  However, right now I wouldn't expect a seller to be flexible based on inspection.  Take it as-is or don't take it at all is the general mentality.  In fact, many sellers are requiring buyers to waive the inspection altogether but I wasn't willing to do that.  

5. I'm looking at solar for my house.  You have to be careful of city codes and potential HOA restrictions.  Solar can be worth it but it takes a decade or more before the savings outweigh the cost of installing them.  

6. Just look up south florida crime rates for areas you're looking.  There is a lot of information out there.  Like anywhere, the suburban areas are typically safer than the urban areas.   

7.  School quality and safety varies widely.   We got lucky with my 6 year old daughter getting into a good charter school kindergarten in Parkland and my 3 year old son goes to a private pre-school also located in Parkland.  Private school tuition can be anywhere from $600 per month to schools like American Heritage being like $30k per year.  

8. Yes, you need insurance for everything.  My homeowners insurance is about $4500 per year.  Health insurance is easily $1000 per month for a family if you don't get it paid for partially by an employer or get a subsidy through the federal marketplace.   Car insurance depends on a lot of factors but we pay about $200 per month for two vehicles.  

9.  This is very subjective.  The law firms are advertising mostly because in Florida there is a law that all car insurance companies must provide up to $10k in medical expenses if someone is injured in an accident.  These lawyers are exploiting that and trying to get a cut as well.  Driving in South Florida is interesting at times so just be smart and use caution.  I don't really think it's much different than any other highly populated area.  

10.  The main perk of a gated community is peace of mind.  Whether manned or just pin pad operated, if someone really wants to get in, they'll figure it out.  For what it's worth, I'm moving from a gated community to a non-gated community and don't feel any less safe.  The gates are often just a hassle whenever someone is coming to visit.  Just be smart by locking your vehicles and home.   When I hear of someone getting broken into, it seems to almost always be a result of leaving something unlocked.  Lock up and most opportunist thieves will move on to an easier target.   

11.  My pool guy is $85 per month for weekly service and my yard guy is $60 biweekly.  You can certainly do it yourself but after buying the equipment and then taking the time and effort to do it yourself, it probably isn't worth it.  That's the conclusion I came to anyways.  

Hopefully this helps you.  As others have said, make sure you do your research and know what you're getting into by moving across the pond.  South Florida is often called a melting pot due to the diverse population but there is definitely high population density as it is.  Not that you moving here will necessarily impact that in any significant way though.  Lastly, if it weren't for my family and friends living here and not wanting to be too far from them, I wouldn't live in South Florida.  I've had enough after 25 years here but I also know there are much worse places to live, so I'm grateful that I have the ability to live somewhere that so many other people wish they could live.  Good luck in whatever you choose to do.",t2_ery78,Krussdog46,0,1644252931.0,0,t1_hvyq8xw,hvyq8xw,True,turboking207,t3_smcp0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/smcp0m/moving_to_south_florida_from_europe_general/,Moving to South Florida from Europe - General Questions,/r/SouthFlorida/comments/smcp0m/moving_to_south_florida_from_europe_general/hvyq8xw/,4,r/SouthFlorida,0,4

"I definitely wouldn’t recommend jumping into buying a house here if you’ve never visited. South Florida is very different than Europe and if you don’t like it here, you have a house tying you down. The general recommendation my dad (a realtor) always gives people is to not buy a house unless you plan on living there for at least 5 years. Of course that can vary based on circumstance, but a decent rule of thumb nonetheless. 

Schools vary on area. Property taxes largely fund our schools so if you’re living in a nicer, more expensive area, there are generally better funded school. I grew up in the Boca area and was generally happy with my schools, but my favorite area of soflo is Jupiter.

"Hi. Fyi in the US, SF normally means San Fransisco. If you wanted to make South Florida shorter you could say S FL. 

Property Tax is high because there is no state income tax. S FL is a big area, so it's hard to say where the best schools. Schools are within a county and if you live in that county you can use the schools there. Normally the one that is closest to you. 

If you wanted a 'cheaper' house but still good schools I would say Martin county is a good place to start. But it's very suburban and there aren't that many jobs. Do you have a job lined up? I would not move here without one. 

Another thing, I feel like you are asking a lot of questions but they are very broad and all over the place. Look at sites like Redfin, for housing with prices and school rating near you. 

If you get into a crash you trade info with the other person and you contact your car insurance. Surely it's the same where you live?

"I’m not sure 4 Mil is getting you a place on Palm Island. Try Key Biscayne.

You *might* be able to get a smaller apartment on Fisher Island. I was actually surprised to see some units selling for around $2 million last year.

Edit to add: if you want something similar to the vibe of Beverly Hills don’t get fooled by Brickell or the denser areas. It’s not going to match up at all. Those areas are like if WeHo and downtown LA had a baby and took glamour shots. 

There are more exclusive enclaves throughout the state as well so I would start with the palm beach islands, fisher island or key biscayne. After that try SW Florida.

Edit to add: actually thinking about it some more, Key Biscayne may actually be more what you are looking for with a budget of 4M. I’m just afraid of you moving here from Beverly Hills expecting the same environment. The places here with those same expectations are going to START at 8 mil and up. Florida is where 100% of the richest families in America own property. 

That said, Key Biscayne surrounds you with the same natural and manicured beauty you get from BH, but more of a Catalina meets Newport Beach vibe.

"With this freeze coming to much of Florida, it is time to harvest our bananas or the fruit will not be as tasty. I also used the harvested plants to mulch the pups and cover them. My banana plants are directly next to a 13 square mile lake that is around 60 degrees currently and that keeps the area a little warmer than the outside lows of around 30 degrees. We got down to 25 degrees last year and had no lasting damage. I think we ended up with over 100 pounds of bananas with this harvest time and have harvested over 10 racks gis year. They propagate easily and can grow in a wet area. 

People as far north or south as 30 degrees latitude  should plant them on a south facing wall. This will block the colder north wind. A huge wall will also trap some heat to release overnight. Cavendish is slightly more cold tolerant than other varieties. If they get below 25, they will not fruit for you and it takes 12-18 months to fruit. This means you would have to protect the plant if you expect colder weather than around 30 degrees. The leaves will burn back around 38 degrees but their leaves grow so fast, that isn’t a big deal. 

You can eat them green as a carb or ripe as a fruit. You can eat the interior of the banana stalk for pounds of nutrients per plant. My plants produce around 30 pounds in the stalk interior and 40 pounds of fruit per plant. You can store them on the tree taking a hand at a time as needed or harvest and freeze. They freeze very well. You can cook them and use the leaves to wrap and cook underground. They are super versatile.",t2_d8ot4laq,Cluck-Haven,0,1643722831.0,0,t1_hv4q1bz,hv4q1bz,True,Cluck-Haven,t3_shv3os,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/shv3os/banana_harvest_preparing_for_freezing_weather_to/,Banana Harvest Preparing for Freezing Weather to Protect Plants from Frost,/r/SouthFlorida/comments/shv3os/banana_harvest_preparing_for_freezing_weather_to/hv4q1bz/,2,r/SouthFlorida,0,2

"Her webpage says she is 'non-partisan'.

The above image would suggest otherwise. Govern yourself accordingly.

Aside from that, [her web](https://votecontreras.com/)doesn't really tell you **anything** about her aside from images of her family and a link to her FB, which I presume may give you more of a clue as to her qualifications, motivations and positions but if you look at her other socials, you see phrases like ""Call me Angel Proud Freedom Fighter Candidate"" ""Mom of three, Wife, Freedom Fighter, Proud Cuban American"" [and this video](https://ne-np.facebook.com/Vote-Contreras-104130648710457/videos/local-palm-beach-mom-runs-for-school-board/389404992641261/) from local news that described her as 'front and center  in the fight as a parent arguing against keeping students masked in palm beach county schools""

If you watch the video above, you will learn that she does support the position that we should not be teaching critical race theory.

She is running against incumbent [Erica Whitfield](https://www.palmbeachschools.org/school_board/biographies/district_4)

[This page has more info](https://ballotpedia.org/Erica_Whitfield) on Erica's background, education, qualifications, and work related experience and achievements in office.

All I'm getting from Angelique's page is (coughcough) ""Proud Freedom Fighter"" but I did not do a deep dive into her social media to ascertain her level of education, background, qualifications, credentials, previous public experience, partnerships, boards she sits on, etc.

On the other hand, even a brief review of Erica's information reveals a highly qualified and educated candidate with 8 years on the job.

That said, to be clear, that's not to say she does not deserve a challenger  (she got a pass last cycle)

I'm just saying that the decision to replace her should be made on QUALITY, not their belief systems on any one or two particular topics - especially when they claim to be so called 'non-partisan' and are very very clearly so very NOT.",t2_3ku6r,way2funni,1,1643652113.0,0,t1_hv0snwf,hv0snwf,True,hicccups,t3_sglhc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/sglhc3/meet_angelique_contreras_school_board_candidate/,"Meet Angelique Contreras, School Board candidate for District 4 in Palm Beach County.

Work in Boca and live in Delray. Your dollar will go further for mortgage and/or rent the further north you go but not by a lot. I’ve been told taxes are higher in Boca too. Boca has Mizner park but Delray has Atlantic Ave. Beaches are about the same but more parking in Delray for some of them. Guess it depends on what you’re looking for? To answer the people question I know you’ll find awesome and not so awesome people anywhere you go. Boca has one of the better rated school systems in the state. Or is did a few years ago anyway. Seems the further west and or north you go there are some worse areas of either town. Both have pluses and minuses but overall I like to live in Delray and play in Boca. This is just my two cents however and should be taken as such.

">The elusive plant, which rarely reveals its slender white petals, lives on trees in remote forests and swamps. Orchid poachers scale trees in swamps alive with snakes, alligators, panthers and mosquitoes to snatch them, and they’re threatened by climate change and the loss of habitat to the expanding suburbs of southwest Florida.

>Only 1,500 or so remain in South Florida, a decrease of up to 50%, states the petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from the Institute for Regional Conservation, Center for Biological Diversity and National Parks Conservation Association. They live only in South Florida and Cuba.

>“This mysterious, beautiful plant captivates Floridians, reminding them of our state’s unique, wild heritage,” said Melissa Abdo, regional director of the National Parks Conservation Association. “While the ghost orchid has always been rare, threats to its existence have become dire in recent years. Poaching, climate change, loss and modification of habitat and direct threats to the ecosystem — even in protected areas like Big Cypress National Preserve — could spell disaster for the species.”

I don’t get how someone who could value a plant enough to collect it would be willing to pay a poacher to help drive it towards extinction.",t2_adg8b,FLTA,0,1643052142.0,0,t1_hu22iga,hu22iga,True,FLTA,t3_sbu2gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/sbu2gz/ghost_orchid_proposed_for_protection_as/,Ghost orchid proposed for protection as endangered species,/r/SouthFlorida/comments/sbu2gz/ghost_orchid_proposed_for_protection_as/hu22iga/,1,r/SouthFlorida,0,1

"So they reinforce laws. They take all the guns and other protective rights from law abiding citizens to make people believe they've done something. (Because Paradise forbid we let them increase our taxes to hire more law enforcement or install camera systems). What Now? The majority of criminals receive their weapons from smuggling and theft, which doesn't include the ones who just manufacture their own.

Now it's a cold night, I want to take my daughter out for some hot chocolate. We wrap up. We take a walk to enjoy the view and talk. Suddenly we're stopped by a large man asking for money. I say no thank you, I've only brought just enough for the hot chocolate, but now he's intent on simply taking what he couldn't demand. 

I don't have enough on my person to the robbers discontent and he's on narcotics armed with a 380 auto. I also have no protection other than my house keys. I mean, why would I? I trust my overworked and under paid local law enforcement to patrol my highly urban jungle effectively. 

Blam! 

I'm shot. It's flooding; definitely an artery. Am I dying? My daughter is there. No one to protect her. She's screaming and now the gun man needs to shut her up. But I'm fading out, and the sounds are getting quieter.... or is she just suddenly now so silent?

&#x200B;

Criminals don't care about laws or who the president is (if they can even remember who that is), so taking the lawful citizens right to protect themselves is in no way going to change their mindset on obeying common decency. They will still rob you, still assault you, and still kill you without any concern for the law.

"check your online/social media too for anything that looks a little over the top. Could have been an UberEats order gone wrong but he's holding you responsible - a lot of times stuff like this starts off as a angry post online yelp, trip advisor, etc. - I only suggest it because oftentimes those userID's have pics of themselves and a clue as to their identity (if you read all their reviews) if you see something that looks a little cray,  a cop can get an ip address from them and from there it's one cross ref to get an address and driver info and if his registered vehicle is a match and his DL face pic lines up - then a cellphone warrant idiots bring their cell phone with them not realizing the cell tower and/or google themselves keep a record along with google of your precise location (whether you turn it on or not) This isn't you? Well you were right there at 5am when this window broke you fucker so you're getting charged.

Thats actually a pretty good pic. I would put up flyers in the hood too.

He's probably REALLY local  - like within 2-3 subdivisions of you. Hire A KID off [CL GIGS](https://miami.craigslist.org/d/labor-gigs/search/lbg) to hit them all (or offer to your current employees as extra scratch) - pay them 10-20 bucks per sub to post these on the streetcorners and take a pic showing the pole and the streetsign as proof so they get paid. Crop the pic so the face fills the sheet of paper and include the link to the video. If you have a few peeps with nothing to do the next few days and are willing to sit in a car in the lot and watch people come and go - do it. They usually cruise by to see the damage. He may even come back late one night after you replaced the glass and hit it again.

Post them in the shopping center too. If you have a CVS/Walgreens publix or a winn dixie - he's probably in there all the time. someone will recognize him - show the video on a phone or tablet wherever you can instead of a print frame - hoomans have a distinctive gait - a single frame freeze will almost always net you an 'I dunno.... maybe' but a video of them walking may have them say 'yep - I know him, he walks like a tard all hunched forward' even though the other features are little more than a blur. Hope you get him.

PS - you may be able to get a better close up image if you export the raw video and then pull a frame directly from it and blow it up in PS vs the cameraphone snapshot of the monitor. 

Use little steps - 10% resize UP and resharpen each time and repeat 10 -20 times and now you have an image you can print on paper that will look good at 200-300 dpi - there are also [dedicated resize apps](https://launchberg.com/best-free-image-resizer-apps/) you can buy",t2_3ku6r,way2funni,0,1642009373.0,0,t1_hsdhfe3,hsdhfe3,False,Irrelaphant,t3_s1wb2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/s1wb2m/this_guy_broke_our_store_window_at_5am_today_then/,This guy broke our store window at 5am today.

"Discussing with the police this morning while looking over the video. They seem to think, and I agree, that this person had a small tool in his pocket meant to break glass. In the video, you dont see his hand wind up. He doesnt pick up any objects on the ground. They think he had a spring loaded center punch or something similar. Maybe one of those emergency tools you store in the car in case you get trapped and need to break the glass. And his choice doesnt make much sense for a junkie.

"I’m giving you the good stuff- for nature it depends on how adventurous you are. One the SWA trials, namely the rookery is open right now and is absolutely wild. You have been warned. It’s some real nature shit. 
Winding waters at sunset is a Florida bucket list scene in my opinion. Winding water is a small park and by the bridge, just a little pass (if not flooded) is incredible when the sun is setting. A good trial at all hours too. 
Kayaking is good at kayak lake worth. Bring cooler and enjoy. 
Nightlife- obviously clematis, but which side depends on your likes. The back end is more grunge and I recommend seeing if there’s any drag at hallaboo (restaurant next to some dive like bars), I like lost weekend because it has some arcade games and is chill with well made drinks that are strong. Also there’s a respectubale street right next to it that has the random, cheap metal shows. 
Good place to eat night life wise is sassafras. Which takes you to the front part of Clamatis which is more button down shirt and jeans type of scenery. 
Food any other time- howleys always. Old diner ran by foodies. Gunanabanas is a little far in Jupiter but is a cool outdoor tiki bar with decent food and I recommend drink wise getting the drink of the gods. 
Elizabthas is packed AF for brunch and a lil pricey but is banging and bottomless mimosas to buy. Also recommend safaras for brunch too. 
Entertainment the museum has frida Kalo right now which is cool, pinball museum, old book store (book exchange) with a solid stock of vintage comics and old ass books for cheap if that interests you which is also by the brass ring which is a dive I saw someone threaten someone at but is still some fire burgers and cheap beer. January 22nd is the Bigfoot convention in lake worth and the fair is going on from the 13th till like the 24th in palm beach. Also if any of you golf the golf here is top notch for hella cheap because old people pay the city taxes for it, go to palm beach island if you want to pretend to be disgustingly rich and soak up the scenery.

Nightlife: Atlantic Ave in Delray or Mizner/Royal Palm plaza in Boca Raton

Of course, since you are here and in your 20s:
Go to South Beach Miami.  Spend a full day at the beach and then at night.

There is scuba/snorkeling around as well.  Check the web for it.

"ah, I'm just messin with ya but if the RV thing is a common denominator, it is a big limitation on where you can live whether you are actually living it it or not.

are you in a position where you can work from anywhere - phone it / XOOM it in and just need a couple weeks/months  to get situated? Try that Florida National Forest thing up in Palm Beach and save your money and then maybe move to a KOA or other RV campground after winter season is over and all the winter/seasonal folks go home and you can score a spot for cheap - even cheaper if you agree to put in a few hours around the place.

On the most frugal end,  if you look on CL under shared rooms [you'll find these halfway house /hostel type](https://miami.craigslist.org/mdc/roo/d/north-miami-beach-super-nice-place-for/7424387731.html) (read 4 or more bunking into a room in bunk beds) arrangements for a little over 110 a week with a 2 week buy in , just bring your overnight bag, change of clothes, toothbrush.

For a little more $$$ (you need at least a month up front and usually a small deposit) you can get [into a room for rent situation](https://miami.craigslist.org/search/roo?) but you have to weed it out. You may have to go through a few of them before you find the good fit so you have to listen to the little voice and ask a lot of questions. Do they have pets that like to yowl at 5am every fucking day?  - etc.

BY the way, while I was looking for the above, [I ran into THIS](https://miami.craigslist.org/mdc/prk/d/miami-unpaved-lot-for-boat-or-rv-storage/7426180977.html) unpaved lot for boat or RV rentals - apparently it's a company /agent specializing in hooking that shit up if you are looking for an RV parking spot. PHONE (786) 723-895. A lot of this stuff looks like just unused ground so forget about living out of it - you park and walk away. Maybe it helps open up other options as you are not tethered to an RV? Maybe someone in their listing service also happens to have a room for rent? give a call and see what you see.",t2_3ku6r,way2funni,0,1641843913.0,0,t1_hs3so7d,hs3so7d,False,[deleted],t3_s0b1mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFlorida/comments/s0b1mo/anyone_looking_for_a_roommate_in_south_florida/,Anyone looking for a roommate in South Florida around Palm beach and Borward county? male 22 years old -I work just trying to relocate,/r/SouthFlorida/comments/s0b1mo/anyone_looking_for_a_roommate_in_south_florida/hs3so7d/,2,r/SouthFlorida,0,2

CALL THEM (561) 924-5310.

As other have said - Wal Mart is usually OK in a pinch. Contact the store manager and ask if there is an out of the way corner they can stash you for the night and you will be on your way in the AM. Use that time to develop leads from the above.
