"Credentials: former US Air Force fighter jet mechanic for an Air Combat Command (ACC) base.

Travis is an Air Mobility Command (AMC) base. They specialize in moving things; people, cargo, fuel, etc. Travis is not a fighter wing. They don't have a fighter squadron, and as such, likely wouldn't have a fighter training program. 

The only way to really know where the jet is from would be if you remembered (or have a photo of) the tail flash - the giant two letters painted on the tail of the jet.

The jet itself should be the [T-38 Talon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_T-38_Talon). The T-6 Texan II is a propeller aircraft, and the T-1 Jayhawk is a passenger jet.

Typically, US Air Force flight training is done at Air Education Training Command bases. The four closest are Vandenberg (west of Bakersfield), Luke AFB in Arizona, Hill AFB in Utah, or Fairchild AFB in Washington. It could be from any AETC base, but those are the closest.

Could also be another branch, but I don't know about those ones.

Downtown is ultimately “the spot” to go out overall, I think I’m just a bit of a hater on downtown because a large amount of the crowd is suburban redneck bros. Not my scene but if you think that might be yours, you might like it a lot.

I was talking about downtown Davis. Cool college party town. Surely plenty of Vacaville folks head there but it’s mostly college kids.

"Vacaville is a reasonably safe, quiet alternative to living in the Bay Area while still technically in the Bay Area we are far more Sacramento Valley, which as you can tell by the weather we are also a part of. 

We are separated by I-80 which decides which of the ZIP Codes you reside, the 88 being older and some say more established and the 87 which tends to be more affordable with affordability being relative now that the minimum one might hope to buy a home is hovering at $500k.  Rents have been escalating as a result.

I have lived in both and find the 88 more walkable to resteraurants and what might be called cultural events.

"> Does anyone know the route they make you take  

Depends on the instructor.

> Should I stop at a stop sign than scoot up a little bit to see if anyone is there?

Yes. Stop behind the stop bar. If you cannot see around the corner (due to cars/bushes/etc in the way) then audibly state ""I can't see around the corner, I need to scoot up a bit."" Scoot up slowly and carefully, brake only, and once you are sure there is no oncoming traffic, proceed in your intended direction.

If you cannot see around the corner AND it's a 4-way stop, stop behind the stop bar, ensure you have right of way, then carefully proceed while checking the unknown traffic direction. If someone blows a stop and hits you, that's on them. 

> do they want you to reverse a certain way?

Not usually a concern, just use your mirrors, check over your shoulders (blind spots), go slow, and be cautious.

-----

Tips:

* Check your mirrors frequently, make sure they are adjusted before you drive.
* Check mirrors and do a quick glance over your shoulder (blind spots) when changing lanes. Always indicate your direction w/ signal stalk. Change lanes with a purpose. Indicate with signals, wait for clearance, then smoothly but swiftly change lanes. Slow stagnating lane changes give assholes the idea that they still have time to pass you or sneak in.
* Do not exceed the posted speed limit. If you don't know what it is, Vacaville as a whole is usually 35-40mph. Orange Drive is 40mph. The east side of Orange Drive turns into Nut Tree Parkway at the Nut Tree Road intersection next to the Chevron. The speed limit on that side is 35. Leisure Town is 40.
* The instructor may get in without buckling up. Make sure that you, your instructor (and all others anyway) are buckled before you even think about moving the car.
* Don't mess with radio, A/C, phone (obviously), seat position, steering wheel position, etc. while moving. If the radio is on and the song is annoying; if you're too hot/cold; etc. wait till you come to a stop or ask the instructor if they would mind lowering the volume/AC/whatever.",t2_78odf,reichbc,0,1626806686.0,0,t1_h5wni72,h5wni72,True,[deleted],t3_oo6ssb,https://www.reddit.com/r/vacaville/comments/oo6ssb/i_am_going_to_take_my_behind_the_wheel_test_in/,"I am going to take my behind the wheel test in Vacaville, what should I know before I take it?",/r/vacaville/comments/oo6ssb/i_am_going_to_take_my_behind_the_wheel_test_in/h5wni72/,3,r/vacaville,0,3

">By Matt Miller

>VACAVILLE — The city, long a hopeful to become a national biotech hub, has landed another major company, Agenus, that will take up a 120-acre parcel of land next to Genentech near Interstate 505.

>Agenus is a biotechnology company focused on immunotherapy, including immuno-oncology, a field that uses the immune system to control or cure cancer, their website states. The company continues to develop CheckPoint Modulators that are anti-cancer vaccines that have been successful with specific patients.

>“Vacaville is a very biotech-friendly town, Genentech is there,” Garo Armen of the Lexington, Massachusetts-based Agenus said in a press release.

>“The city is willing to work with us as partners. We will certainly expand our antibody manufacturing facilities. We will also have a manufacturing campus and process development, and we can also put our plant-derived product expansion there as well,” Armen added. “We have a total of 120 acres of land, and the city wanted us to be the new owner, instead of companies looking to build shopping centers or retail, since we are adding value to the area, and adding skilled jobs to the area.”

>Armen said the company has had operations in Berkeley, but has since moved down to Emeryville. They were able to purchase the old Xoma manufacturing site there. Vacaville will be another addition.

>“We were looking for a complement to Emervyille,” said Kimberly Ha, the media relations coordinator of Agenus. “Vacaville is a pretty biotech-friendly town. One of the main reasons we chose Vacaville was because of the mayor (Ron Rowlett). He was very supportive in attracting new companies there.”

>Ha could not say how many would be employed at the Vacaville plant, but the company currently has more than 350 employees.

>Agenis announced last month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted Agenus’ biologics license application for balstilimab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy. The FDA has granted priority review to this submission, a designation for drugs which, if approved, may provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment of serious conditions. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has set a target action date of Dec. 16.

>Agenus also announced this week the closing of its global exclusive license with Bristol Myers Squibb for Agenus’ proprietary bispecific antibody program, AGEN1777, and the FDA clearance of an investigational new drug application for this therapy. AGEN1777 is an Fc-enhanced antibody in late preclinical development designed to target major inhibitory receptors expressed on T and NK cells to improve anti-tumor activity.

>Both of these products could be produced at the Vacaville plant.

>Genentech, another mighty biotech company, came to Vacaville in 1994. Many consider it the founder of the industry.

>“This is humongous,” Vacaville City Councilman Roy Stockton said. “Biocon Valley. This is a very huge step in achieving that goal. We as a council are elated. We can educate our kids here with the biotechnology program at Solano Community College and they can now find careers that will allow them to live here.

30 mins each way is an hour a day and that's during Covid non commuting patterns. So per month that's at least 20 hours.

30 minutes is roughly 25 mi each way or 50 mi/day. Average car that's 1.5 gallons of gas alone, not to mention wear and tear. 30-40 gallons of gas is ~$150/mo.

So, by living in VV, you're losing 20 hours per month on the road and $150/mo in gas alone. Add in another couple hundred per month in tires, brakes, other wear and tear.

So in the end, raw dollars you're paying minimum $200/mo to live in VV vs Napa and likely more with wear and tear. Then, add in the quality of life of 20 hrs/month with your family and I really recommend pondering all options.

Lots of beer and micro breweries around 

Plenty of nature to explore however the drought is drying up a lot of lakes an reservoirs. Pray for rain. 

Vacaville seems to be predominantly red in a predominantly blue state. 

The Nugget market is amazing. It’s like a local Whole Foods. 

Schools are okay but do your DD.

It's the perfect home base for someone who likes to experience everything California has to offer.",t2_n6e0q,nathinnizzle,0,1625021614.0,0,t1_h3inim6,h3inim6,False,[deleted],t3_oak5r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/vacaville/comments/oak5r4/thinking_about_moving_to_vacaville_from_michigan/,Thinking about moving to Vacaville from Michigan.

"Vacaville is right in the middle of pretty much everything in NorCal.  The city itself is around ~100k people.  Good schools, good variety of stores and shopping for pretty much any need, good food and foodie scene, lots of small parks and recreational spots and everything a medium sized ""city"" would have.

You're 40 mins from Sac, 50 mins from Napa/Sonoma, 75 mins from the SF, 90 mins from the beaches, 90 mins from the foothills, 90 mins from silicon valley/San Jose, 2 hours to the mountains/Tahoe/snow 3 hours to Reno, 6 hours to LA, 6 hours to Oregon...there are 4 international airports within an hour and a half if you don't want to drive the long trips...

You're right in the middle of the I-80 corridor so you have easy access to the main freeway to get anywhere you want to go.

Winters get rainy at times but are pretty mild in recent years, usually lows in the 40's...if you want snow it's a quick drive up the mountains to the Sierras for skiing/boarding.  Summers have been getting quite warm though with multiple days of 100°+ heat.  It's dry heat though so very little humidity which I think makes it much more bearable.  There are lakes and rivers nearby as well as the Pacific beaches and Delta you can always go cool down at though.  The city itself is near lots of farm-land so you have a decent green-belt around most of the area and the Vaca Mountains on the other side.

I'd say it's a decent mix of 20s/30s, middle-aged, and an older crowd which keeps things fairly stable.  Low crime rate, but good variation of activities, festivals, street events, etc...overall the city has become a good 'commuter' city with people living here to get away from the hustle/chaos/expense of the bay or sac but close enough to drive the 45-60 minutes to work each day.

I'm never leaving here...it really is the perfect spot to be in my opinion...",t2_1j4kj5ha,PaintballTek,0,1625018714.0,0,t1_h3ihu3t,h3ihu3t,True,[deleted],t3_oak5r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/vacaville/comments/oak5r4/thinking_about_moving_to_vacaville_from_michigan/,Thinking about moving to Vacaville from Michigan.

"If you're wanting to be near Travis then you're going to probably want to look around southern vacaville or the newer vacaville junction (which is actually fairfield). It's mostly homes over here but I think there are a few apartment complexes off of Alamo. I like that part of Vacaville a lot, its newer, quiet and family friendly with good parks and lots of space. The draw back is that its near the prison but its a mostly a medical prison that has few escapes.

"It’s kind of on the outskirts of town but really nice and quiet area. If you are looking for more in town, we also looked at Morgan Park and River Oaks which both were pretty nice! 

I saw that you said you are outdoorsy, check out Pena Adobe/Lagoon Valley park once you get here! Great hiking trails and really nice area to get out and relax.

No it’s not subjective. Solano County is 100% Bay Area.  I grew up in Benicia we considered it the Bay Area. I went to CSUEB everyone considered it the bay. My husband and I work in San Francisco and I have never encountered a single person to say that it wasn’t. I lived in Santa Rosa (also considered the Bay Area) for 15 years before moving here and they even said it was the Bay Area. You the only one saying opposite. My dude...

"I have been to several good spots in the bay, Paxti's down in San Jose was quite good, though deep dish has always felt a bit heavy (partly why I haven't been to some of the other places).  I'm partial to Chicago Fire in Sacramento on J St. but usually only 1 slice does me in. Admittedly Paxti's was always ordered by my buddy Sean who prefers deep dish so I haven't tried their thinner crust options though they do look good.

I have been to cheeseboard, though admittedly it was for cheese not pizza, I may have to try it at some point when I'm down there though just by looking at their menu I've never been a huge fan of...what I consider...'new age style' pizza with non-traditional toppings or vegan/vegetarian. Nothing against it, just not for me, heh.  The one spot in Berkeley (Oakland?) I did go which was surprisingly good since I'm not normally a fan was Namaste Pizza.  Generally not into Indian, but their Chicken Pizza Masala was quite tasty.

I've been to most of the spots along North Beach which were all good, Calzones, Golden Boy, and Il Casaro (prosciutto pizza...nom) are some of my favorites, I usually find myself going to Stinking Rose, North Beach Cafe, House of Prime Rib, Chart House, or Aliodos when I'm in the city though so pizza kind of takes a back seat. At some point I'd like to make it to Del Popolo as I have heard nothing but good things.

Going the other direction, the Causeway Classic at Woodstock's in Davis is a great pizza, though their folded over crust always kinda fell flat to me, nontheless a great pie.  In Sac aside from the aforementioned Chicago Fire I like Masullos, Ricos, and Il Fornaio.  And if you're ever as far north as Oroville Shakey's Pizza is a must go as well, Shakey's Special with a side of Mojo's...mmm.

To me Pizza has been about comfort though I do also respect good variety as well.  I was raised here in VV and while I have traveled and tried a lot of different pizza there's nothing quite like the one made at Pietro's #2 for me.  It's got a thicker breadier crust than most styles that rises more when it bakes, though it's not that 'deep dish' caserole style chicago pizza that some of these spots are famous for.  It gives a good base for the toppings and leaves you with the equivelant of a fresh piece of crispy airy baked bread for your crust...nothing quite like it that I have found.  Great dipped in olive oil and balsamic 😌

Someone else mentioned Vicinis in Fairfield, their pizza is also good (used to go there fairly often when they were in VV) but their cheese garlic bread is TO DIE FOR.  Can't go wrong with melted mozzarella and sliced fresh garlic and butter melted over fresh bread....oh man.

Oh, also...to elaborate on Pieology, my absolute favorite combination there (which is admittedly quite rich):  stuffed regular crust, olive oil, white sauce, mozzarella cheese, extra ricotta cheese, garlic, mushroom, black olive, ham, pepperoni, and half with regular chicken, and half with buffalo chicken.

"Since I am originally from the East Coast, I like to go for a good thin crust pie.

Napoli has quality pizza and Italian food, they grate their own good Parmesan, and the service is warm & friendly.

Vicini's in Fairfield is delicious, creative menu, and they have stellar garlic knots and zeppoli, too. They used to run a location on Peabody & Alamo that houses a Mountain Mike's.

Evelyn's on Texas St. in Fairfield has a huge slice with a drink deal - plenty! The larger 26"" & 32"" pizzas are delicious and feed a crowd. Too bad they closed the one in downtown Vacaville.

If I lived equidistant from all of the above, I would go to all three evenly.

Also on the RIP list is Pizza Pucks, which was on Monte Vista & Depot (where a Mountain Mike's is now). Very different concept: think cinnamon roll-style crust with bits of toppings all up in there. They used to have an all-you-can-eat family night and it was amazing. Every few years someone will post from their social media like they are making another go, but it hasn't happened yet. I'm still rooting for them!

For the rest:

On ""just need pizza quick"" days we get Costco. Cennario's and Pizza Guys are ok but I didn't find them worth seeking out. Notice I didn't mention Mountain Mike's - they're...ok, but I definitely don't see the need for their 257 locations. Round Table and Little Caesar's are for when you need to buy for the kids - they do the job. Papa Murphy's is never as good as you think it's going to be, plus you have to turn on your oven and that's a no-go on most days from June-September.

We went to Amici's when we first moved here 14 yrs ago and thought it was a bit burnt. The restaurant was pretty loud and it was fairly spendy. I owe them another try, but I like a chew to the crust not simply super thin.

One bonus entry - if you're ever jonesing for Chicago-style pizza, go to Berkeley and pick up a Zachary's half-baked and bring it home. Omg is it worth the trip, and you can certainly find something else to do while you're there, right? Another Chicago winner is The Star on Grand in Oakland/Lake Merritt area. A wonderful place to conclude a day of Bay Area sightseeing with the family or visitors.

"I doubt you will need one living in the middle of the city, I think this year was the first time since like the 60's since anywhere near downtown was close to being in ""wildfire"" danger area.  However it never hurts to be prepared and a generator can come in handy in all sorts of situations.  Usually any 'rolling blackout' is a few hours at most.

Personally though we did get one this year after the big fires and it ended up saving us a couple months later during another black-out due to a PG&E fuck up.  Ended up running it a couple times to keep our fridges cold and not spoil the food when the power lines were down for a 48hr stint.

"Vacaville PD on FB

Yesterday evening a video surfaced of an interaction between one of our officers and his canine partner during training. We understand how disturbing the video appears to many who view it and the range of emotions it creates. What the video doesn’t show is the moments prior, when the canine became aggressive towards his handler. We want to assure the public this incident is being evaluated in its entirety and will be investigated appropriately.

Our canine program is, and always has been an incredibly vital and important part of our policing. Entrusted with a difficult job, we rely on them to respond with precise skill leaving very little room for misjudgments. When we stray from this expectation, we are left vulnerable to an animal making decisions that could impact our communities safety. This underscored the importance of training and the value of a police dog responding appropriately to his handler in a given situation.

Although our canines appear to be pets, just like the ones we all have at home; they are quite different in many ways. If left unguided by a handler, the decisions they make could lead to the injury of the dog, an officer or an innocent community member. All training programs are not alike and need to be tailored to the needs of the specific dog and handler. This is generally achieved by a careful balance of physical discipline and reward based training. As with any training program, we are constantly evaluating our policies and procedures for needed improvement. We are still collecting all the information as it pertains to this incident for the purposes of that evaluation.

We want to assure our community that our canine program is one of the most loved in our department. Our four legged partners are far more than just a tool, they are a member of our PD family. For the many thousands of people we have met at demonstrations, school functions, church gatherings and other events; you have witnessed this love and devotion, and the incredible bond our canine teams share.

"I need more context here. Did they just randomly come up to you and shout Trump 2020? Were they looking to get ""signatures"" for some bullshit petition? 

I grew up in VV and went to high school here and moved out to the Bay for college and came back here because of covid. 

Believe me, I know the cultural differences between VV and the Bay Area. Sure there are a quite a few, Blue Lives Matter flags that I have seen around here. I'd say VV is pretty split even between conservative and liberal. I heard there were multiple protests back in May and June at City Hall about police reform and had a pretty good turn out even though most were college aged kids. There were also some counter protests in support of police as well.

I'd say the people in VV who are liberal are most likely college-educated and on the younger spectrum say 18 - 35 age range. There is a pretty big military presence because of Travis and generally any town with an AFB right next to it will have people who lean conservative.

I'd say VV is a tale of two cities.

In the staff report under Next Steps, staff state that they recommend returning to Council for a discussion on what types of cannabis businesses (if any) they want to allow if the tax measure is approved. So I guess there's still a future decision that needs to be made on whether to allow it or not.

Personally I'd say no. I'm not super sure how taxes work for medical users but as it is there are already about 30% in taxes on cannabis purchases. I've heard tacking on a ton of taxes is another way of disincentivizing use and distribution. Vacaville barely has a cannabis market already so those who are consuming in the area are either trying to support local business or actually need it.

I believe every district has its own requirements and I am not sure what VV is requiring. The district my husband works for (not in VV) requires teachers to live-teach 45 minute lessons for 5 split periods and to also give the students work to do asynchronously. It is a LOT of work on the teacher's part (same lesson 10 times over 2 days) and requires a lot of attention from students but so far the students seem pretty engaged with the material. It's a delicate balance between keeping everyone engaged and making sure everyone doesn't get burned out on Zoom.,t2_14keg0,greatertrocanter,0,1598725308.0,0,t1_g39kxmt,g39kxmt,True,[deleted],t3_iiawsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/vacaville/comments/iiawsf/10_minutes_per_high_school_class/,10 Minutes per High School Class,/r/vacaville/comments/iiawsf/10_minutes_per_high_school_class/g39kxmt/,2,r/vacaville,0,2
