"Really? I went to college at U of A in the late 90s and early 2000s, and the live music scene at the time **sucked**. JR’s Lightbulb Club pretty much stopped having live music. Dave’s on Dickson and George’s still had a show here or there, but not much. Clunk Music Hall had shows, but they got progressively weirder and weirder indie shit. And that was it. 

By contrast, OKC seems like a boon. Tower has tons of stuff. Criterion is finally stepping up their game. Beer City Music Hall is getting more and more. Jones Assembly gets some good acts. Big stadium shows at Paycom. Zoo Amp gets good stuff. With luck both the Blue Note and the Blue Door will open again.  89th Street Collective is great for punk acts. Diamond Ballroom seems to have a lot of metal shows, but definitely isn’t limited to that (I saw Modest Mouse there a few months back).

"I had high standards, I just didn't know what to avoid. Essentially I married how my father treated me in my first wife (felt all to comfortable), how my mother did in my second wife (again ""comfort"" or what I knew).

The problem is both my parents are fucking assholes (narcissists). My wives were smart AF, pretty, could carry on a good conversation, great earning potential, fun to sex up (well the 2nd one), but they were both abusive, manipulative, mentally fucked up, and cruel women. Not an ounce of kindness in them combined. Just like my parents. Funny thing is they both despised the parent they mirrored.

26 years, 2 sets of undergrads and PhD programs later and I have jack shit to show for supporting them and building them up. The nice thing is, I'm free now.

"So, I remember having arguments about this type of thing in the past.  Specifically the ten commandments mess.  What I learned is the First Amendment initially did not limit the ability of the individual states to ""establish state religions"" only that the Federal Government couldn't.  Of course, since then there have been several cases that tested that and the Supreme Court extended the limitation of government-sanctioned religions to Federal and State governments.  I suspect the author of this bill just wanted his grandma to be proud of him for once.   This is an example of a worthless bill that is simply designed to cause a fuss so that it is easier for them to pass bills under the table, or at least so we don't notice it until it is too late.  The GOP has been great at doing this over the last 20+ years so it doesn't surprise me.

"I mean, dude, if we have to have a state book, can't it be something specific to Oklahoma? I can think of so many amazing books by Oklahoma authors, or about Oklahoma, that would be actual real good state books. I remember learning the state everythings as a little girl, it was part of school. The rock (rose rock), the bird (scissortsil flycatcher), etc. The state book should ideally, aside from all other arguments about contemporary issues, be something that idealizes and encapsulates the daily life and beliefs and culture of Oklahoma as a whole, or at the very least in part. Oklahoma has produced so many magnificent artists (I know you guys can name a lot!) in so many fields. We need to acknowledge the people of Oklahoma, from all backgrounds and stories and heritages, and what it means to live on this earth, this red earth we all love, together, as a community, whether we love or hate each other. We are still on this clay and sand together. We all feel the wind. We all know the sun and the grass and the storms and the great, magnificent sky. We all toil under that blazing sun, and stand in silent awe at the destruction of nature that happens here. This world is our home, no matter our origins. We live here together. It is hard and terrifying most times, and most of us are struggling just to get by. But the love is there, I fucking swear it. I feel it, see it. This is the swirling vortex of the American plains, the center of the tornado, the immeasurable contents of the node of a black hole. We live here, in these extreme circumstances, and we continue to survive. Oklahomans are amazing. The rest of it is a side show, all the labels and preaching and ideology. We are people here, together, on this land, struggling into survive. All that divides us is imaginary. This is the biggest fucking tornado of our lives, an F10 million. And there's no telling how it will move, where it will go, what will happen. We need to stick together. Love each other. Be strong and brave, and damn the differences.

"""I don't think saying a statement makes it true. Idk why u would think that.""  
I see a lot of religious people just proclaim their beliefs and expect other people to be converted by them. Why is this guy proclaiming his beliefs on a street corner he must think this is going to convert people and save them from hell. I am a Atheist so if hanged out in a church with a sign that said God is not real, I would not expect anybody to believe it because I provided no arguments.

"" I can tell you don't talk to many religious people""

I don't discuss religion in person because its rude but I do observe their behavior and argue online and I am interested in religious history. 

""we're all talking about the same thing from different perspectives and no one has the idea perfectly but I roll with this one and try to be a good person.""

I've noticed theirs this common belief going around that all religions basically say the same thing. First of all not all religions are monotheistic. Even within within Abrahamic monotheism their are important differences. Jews don't think Jesus was a god or son of god. Muslims believe he was only a prophet and not a god. There are Christians who believe that Jesus is not god but just son of god.",t2_lo06c,TejasEngineer,0,1647876378.0,0,t1_i1jgbgp,i1jgbgp,False,WarMaiden666,t3_tiz9b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/okc/comments/tiz9b7/south_side_3202022/,South side. 3/20/2022,/r/okc/comments/tiz9b7/south_side_3202022/i1jgbgp/,0,r/okc,0,0

"I run a property management company, and we’ve rented to a very wide variety of tenants. I’m progressive, and I support a robust social safety net. I also think there’s a moral imperative for landlords and property managers to recognize that housing isn’t just a commodity, but a fundamental requirement for stable society and lives.

All that said, I will tell you frankly and directly that the typical Section 8 tenant in OKC leaves properties in much worse condition that their non-Section 8 counterpart. I’ve lived it, smelled it, and cleaned it out myself. The tenants also tend to be demanding and often have a high sense of entitlement.

Szechuan Story for amazing Szechuan food that you can’t get at most Chinese-American restaurants. Their chili oil dumplings are DELICIOUS, and will make your tongue tingle, and they’ve got pretty good scallion pancakes, too.

Chow’s for great Chinese-American food, as well as a plethora of other non-standard Chinese dishes, like pork with a shit ton of hot peppers that will make you wanna call your mom and try the gallon of milk challenge.

Goro has great Ramen in a super cool atmosphere, and they even do creative twists like broth-less chilled ramen, or a Japanese Highball with banana syrup.

If you wanna feel like you’re in Asia and make your own food, hit up Super Cao Nguyen. Amazing place.

"To give you a perspective , most of those $600 a month apartments are in dangerous areas , have a history of bedbugs , management who will not fix anything . So moving into that ""cheap"" apartment will usually cost those tenants their sanity along with whatever belongings get stolen or infested.

I was able to show them my w2 for last year of 29k ,same job , same hours ( same fking bonus's) but thats all besides the point. at 750 a month thats almost half my income a month. AFFORDABLE housing. with a car payment , insurance , health insurance , internet , cell phone & electric  costing another $800 , this leaves about 300 for food , laundry , gas and any incidentals including co-pays and prescriptions. and they said i EARNED TOO MUCH . for a 2 bed , i would have no way qualified for a 1 bed , a 2 bed would have given me an office to work out of , and i just happened to have paid off my car so without that payment i could swing it.

"Maybe I have a different perspective. I have been dirt poor I lived in crappy apartments and was in poverty for a portion of my life. If you put down Diatomaceous earth down around the edges of the apartment, clean your apartment daily, take out the garbage right away, and just lived a clean life the inside of those apartments were nice. I even managed on the weekends an inexpensive apartment to earn extra money to buy a house and discount on my rent.

I then bought a house when covid first started for 170 and it's grown 30k in just a year. I don't see anything wrong with living in the affordable apartments as long as you have a vision and plan to get out of it. It's a temporary space and I have fond memories of it. I'm grateful for what they let me achieve. I respect them for what they are a way to live affordably/simply and pursue your dreams. 

I'm also from the west coast where housing is not affordable, Seattle and Portland. I came to OKC to buy a house since it wasn't possible for me on the west coast.

"15. The average apartment is more than double what it is in okc though. The average salary in Seattle is 84k OKC is 60k. OKC average apartment though is way more affordable in comparison to wages.

When they should only pay 30% more if it's one vs one comparison.  670 apartment is a affordable apartment and they are available in OKC they aren't in places with a real affordable housing crisis like Seattle, Austin, LA, NY, etc etc. I don't understand how we can say we have an affordable housing crisis when our houses are 1/3 the price of other areas. We have one of the most affordable housing prices in the country for a city. You could find cheaper areas in rural areas but for a city we have one of the best.

">“We’ve kind of reverted to a unique problem in the last couple of years where you’re not just seeing the typical affordability issues,” he explained. “You see a lot of people that typically might be able to afford a unit with our assistance programs, like the vouchers that we offer, but they’re finding that landlords aren’t wanting to work with anyone with those programs. They’re just saying no. Even people that otherwise might have worked with those programs in the past, now they’re just not.”

>Shadid suspects that the massive recent influx of young professionals into the city is driving up demand for housing from tenants that don’t require housing assistance or vouchers.

>“What I’m hearing from our service providers out there is that these landlords and managers think, with the demand, that they don’t really have to work with us anymore,” he said. “Previously, maybe they would have been a really good option for these programs, but now if they can get someone in there that they view as more stable, even if that’s not really true, then they think that’s better and easier for them.”

I’m a landlord (though have been actively divesting almost all my properties), and while I haven’t dealt with this specific program, I can tell you from talking with other LLs that this is definitely part of the issue. If I have a choice between tenants, one of whom will just pay me cash and the other of which has a voucher that will cover part of the rental costs and requires me to deal with a third party and fill out extra paperwork, meet people for additional inspections, etc… which do you think I (and most landlords) will choose? 

Second, if you are using a voucher program, you are almost certainly a bad credit risk. These vouchers typically cover just a portion of the rental payment; the tenant is expected to cover the rest. So, if I’ve got a tenant choice between a tenant with no voucher and good credit, vs. a tenant with a voucher and bad credit, I’m going to choose the no voucher tenant. I don’t want to be in a situation where I am more likely to just get partially paid (via the voucher), and then be stuck having to go through additional steps per an agreement with the voucher issuer before I can initiate an eviction of a non-paying tenant. 

Third, rightly or wrongly, there is a perception that people receiving housing assistance tend to be more destructive to properties. This view is pervasive among those landlord who are familiar with Section 8 tenants. I’ve never personally experienced it (and am not sure if there is a marked different with any other type of tenant), but that belief definitely exists and is likely a reason landlords would be similarly hesitant to rent to these voucher holders.",t2_4heb2,putsch80,0,1647707467.0,0,t1_i1aoydl,i1aoydl,True,lennonpatton,t3_thy8mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/okc/comments/thy8mu/complex_affordable_housing_crisis_on_display/,Complex affordable housing crisis on display across Oklahoma City,/r/okc/comments/thy8mu/complex_affordable_housing_crisis_on_display/i1aoydl/,29,r/okc,0,29

"I feel like people who have to choose between feeding themselves or feeding their pets should have a chance of getting their pet food through this program. 

Just a short personal story. My elderly great-aunt was skipping meals so she could feed her 5 cats plus strays, (we found out shortly after her brother died, and he'd been helping her financially) she's the kind of person who should be able to put that worry aside. We got her signed up for SNAP so she could have dedicated funds for her own groceries as well as helping her pay for cat food so she wasn't spending what little social security she was getting on the cats. This was back in 2014, she passed shortly after in 2015 when she was 82.

I love that you want to feed the strays, but really we need to focus on making sure the stray population is neutered as well as fed, have you ever done trap and release before? If we can get a handle on overpopulation that would help the strays immensely. Several shelters here work on a low cost or no cost spay program for strays.",t2_15g0xx,Ozemba,0,1647662636.0,0,t1_i18s515,i18s515,False,Ozemba,t3_th2g1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/okc/comments/th2g1v/no_income_restrictions_and_you_do_not_need_id_to/,"No income restrictions and you do not need ID to receive food.

I agree with it being a problem. There’s a database that is updated anytime a narcotic is prescribed and so the Dr.’s can see if someone is abusing them. I would suggest taking your reports to Dr. Martinez at the AmPm clinic in NW Oklahoma City. He is amazing about prescribing appropriate medication. Even if there is a liability because he is a good Dr. And their really shouldn’t be liability if there is a medical need to back it up.

"Okies also don’t know what “do not impede the left lane” means. They’re notorious for feeling like they own the left lane and they can give permission to who they choose to pass them and they’re not willing to move to the right to let you pass when it’s finally your turn. I’ve driven in 20 states and hands down this state is the worst for roads and their drivers. Turning lanes are non existent and they don’t know how to use them. They still have their rear end hanging out of the turning lane and the left lane they just got out of. They also don’t know to pull forward on the turn lane with a median. Because when they don’t it’s causing the opposite side that’s also turning no way to see until they finally turn, unblocking your view/ 
Also, it’s essential to have a dash cam in your car if you live here. Lots of drivers like to “shave your door handles” trying to cut you off in a merge instead of waiting till the right side opens up for the person to move. Which entails them to regulate and judge their speed and they don’t function that fast around here. It’s never ending. Basis of this comment. Okies don’t know how to drive. And they don’t know how to build/maintain their roads.
