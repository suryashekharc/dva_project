"While I agree with a lot of your points, it'll be awhile before we see 737s in Ocala.  Before the pandemic Delta flew 9 flights a day from Gainesville.  Those were pretty much all CRJs.  They recently completed an expansion that added two new gates, bringing them to a total of 5.  Delta is now flying some 717s, but I haven't seen a 737 yet.  First Ocala will get regular service with CRJs and stay that way for quite some time.  It doesn't make sense to upgrade the infrastructure to handle bigger planes until you've already established demand.  I would guess we're 20 years away from having more than regional jets.

"Right now, it's fine.  Tiny even.  But if you plan to live in the area a long time it's important to note that Marion County is extremely development friendly.  For example, Alachua and Marion County both had about the same population in the 1990's.  Since then, Marion county has outgrown Alachua by +100,000 residents, currently 375k for Marion to 278k for Alachua.

All the major companies are building their distribution facilities south of Alachua, in the Marion - Sumter I75 corridor.  The Villages growth is also explosive and their distribution is coming more and more from Marion and Sumter rather than Orange county.

There is no major airport between Tampa/Orlando and Jacksonville.  Ocala is going to want to be that location as the sweet spot between Gainesville and the Villages, the City of Ocala has said so:

>The City of Ocala will promote the Ocala International Airport as a premier general aviation airport serving commercial, industrial and corporate needs of the City of Ocala and Marion County.  The City intends to concentrate on operating the airport as a general aviation facility, expanding current infrastructures to accommodate large aviation activities, while maintaining high levels of service to its tiedown and t-hangar clientele.  The Ocala International Airport will be operated with fiscal responsibility and responsiveness to the needs of its users and tenants.  The vacant Airport land shall be marketed to its highest and best use to ensure the financial viability of the City-owned facility. The City encourages the cooperation of private and public sector investment for the development of corporate hangars and other compatible uses at the Ocala International Airport.

So judging by the growth rate we've been able to observe locally, particularly west of I75 where both On Top of the World and the World Equestrian Center are located, I would expect the 60th ave North/south that the Airport sits on (also west of I75, directly between these 2 major destinations) to explode with growth and the airport to slowly expand to accommodate the growing demand.

"Most likely those outlets are tied into a switch - older homes relied on floor lamps for lighting so they put in switched outlets.

If not that, then I would suspect a tripped GFCI outlet somewhere between that outlet and your electrical panel - the GFCI outlets look similar to regular outlets but they have tiny buttons on them. For any that you find, press the ""test"" button on the outlet and you should hear a click (this is GFCI in action). Then press the ""reset"" button and go test your defunct outlets again.

Less likely is that the wires (or wire nuts) are no longer connected to the terminals on the outlet(s). Fixing this would require removing the outlet cover and pulling the outlet out of the electrical box - this can be dangerous even with a defunct outlet so you should turn off the circuit breaker before checking the connections.

Big Hammock downtown is small but incredible. The ramen bowls and bao buns are seriously the best. Really great locally brewed beers on tap and knowable bartenders. Place is small but definitely somewhere to check out. 

Enjoy local 😊. You can go to a chain restaurant anywhere.

"That is not a true story. Research it. NBC studios owned the area of what was once known as Silver Springs and used it to produce a few movies and tv shows. They brought in just a few Reece monkeys for a particular scene in one of the Tarzan films filmed there. The persons in charge of the monkeys did not secure them and they were able to escape. Eventually mating and populating the area. Making that area their home ever since. In the 80’s we would feed the monkeys but they stopped that practice as the monkeys became smart, coming in board, swiping valuables etc. The monkeys are still in the area.

I’ve done a lot of cave exploring around here back in the early 90’s. A lot of places are either covered up or on private property now. 
But the craziest one was in Summerfield. It’s an abandoned stone house built on top of a limerock deposit and there’s a carved out staircase in the living room that leads down to man made tunnels and rooms all throughout the deposit under the house.
I don’t know if it’s still there or if it’s accessible anymore though.

"Silver Springs State Park is a must.  Recommend renting a kayak and doing the Silver Run.  If you're addicted to kayaking, drive out into the forest and also do Juniper Run, which is a top kayaking run in the entire country.

My favorite local area restaurants are Stumpknockers (not actually in Ocala, but near) and Grace Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi (i go for the sushi, specifically).

Dowtown town square is worth a stroll, some art galleries and such.  If you want to get food right there, the Brick City Southern Kitchen & Whiskey Bar is reliably good food. If you want to smell like cigarettes for the rest of the day, you can walk into O'Malley's for 10 seconds. Infinite Ale Works is a decent brewery that's like a 5 minute walk from the square.

"I've lived in the SW block for about 10 years and I've got strong opinions about internet:

* [Centurylink](https://www.centurylink.com/) was able to give me bonded vdsl @ 80 down and 8 up, failing to maintain those speeds they downgraded me to 60 down and 4 up.  It's a direct connection and doesn't require a dedicated IP to hit from the outside.
* [Zito Media](https://www.zitomedia.net/) took over for Fibervision took over for Cablevision took over for Joe Blow >,<.  That being said, they are my current ISP with ""Fiber to the curb"".  They've offered me ""Gigabit"" download and something like 25mb up.  In practice I get between 500 and 800mps, so I'm pretty happy.  There's basically a daily outage, though, as the connections will just \*poof\* disappear for seemingly no reason.  The network is configured with a [CGNAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT), so you need a $10 / month dedicated IP if you want to hit your network from the outside.
* [Starlink](https://starlink.com/) .. any day now.  My understanding is they're also using a CGNAT and will require a static IP in order to access from the outside.
* [Ocala Fiber](https://www.ocalafl.org/government/city-departments-i-z/ocala-fiber-network) is a nice pipe dream if they'll ever come out this far
* Cellular internet:  I have an AT&T hotspot I use for backup and it's pretty consistently available, albeit slow.

Naturally, your options will vary based on your distance from the telco, you might check [https://www.dslreports.com/](https://www.dslreports.com/) for more details that are specific to you.

It's not good or healthy in anyway. It's sexualizes children and it's wrong. I have no problem with people being gay or lesbian I don't care what people do. Leave the kids out of it.

"You think people who make under $60,000 per year don't pay taxes? What planet are you on? If you made $57,000 dollars last year, you paid about $10,000 in taxes. 

""We are in serious debt""? Who is? The country? Are you talking about the National Debt? Trump added $6.7 trillion to the national debt between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2020, a 33.1% increase. You're suddenly concerned NOW? The ""National Debt"" is nothing but an abstract number that Conservatives like to pretend to worry about when a Democrat is in office, and then forget about it as soon as they win an election. It has no effect on you, me, or anyone you care about. Doesn't matter to any of us so do us a favor and stop clutching your pearls.

Speaking of elections and parties getting crushed, Republicans have won the popular vote exactly once since 1988. With the Electoral College they're hanging on by a thread, but at some point as the wealth disparity increases, the scales are going to tip and that's not going to be enough to save them anymore. 

You like the idea of nationalized healthcare, and I bet you like your social security and medicare too - you're almost getting it, but for some reason you're not quite grasping the fact that you're a Democrat.

"Haha riiiight. Actually it IS simple. 1) There are absolutely noise ordinances and motor vehicle laws regulating the loudness of exhaust pipes… so yea, illegal. 2) Anyone driving a vehicle on a street making the types of noises I was hearing was almost certainly speeding and/or driving recklessly… so again, illegal. 3) While sure, my posts/responses weren’t praising the noise, they were far from complaining and whining, esp to a level that I would uproot my life & family to escape them. I was genuinely curious what could cause that level and type of noise, trying NOT to assume the worst about people doing illegal activities. 4) Last, the notion that I can’t inquire on an online forum about something in my community w/o being told “don’t like it? shut up or move” would seem to be the antithesis of free speech… which I’m guessing free speech is something you’re very much interested in keeping alive in this wonderful country.",t2_6a9fyk4d,ohdogg79,0,1643551220.0,0,t1_huup6a6,huup6a6,False,ohdogg79,t3_sfvzyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ocala/comments/sfvzyf/loud_engine_noises_tonight/,Loud engine noises tonight??,/r/ocala/comments/sfvzyf/loud_engine_noises_tonight/huup6a6/,4,r/ocala,0,4

"Are HOA's really common there?  I come from a part of the country where they are only common in new planned communities.  You almost never pay HOA in a community over 30 years old.  Also this CDD thing is something that Florida cooked up.  I have talked to people who live in small beach communities here on the gulf side of central Florida and they claimed to pay almost a $10000 in HOA a year.  

In Texas and Oklahoma, you never pay HOA on a build on your own lot unless it is in a planned community and that would be exceedingly rare as the builder owns all of the lots until they sell them, so they are mostly the only ones that build there.",t2_7diuqvnx,dmatlick,0,1643048918.0,0,t1_hu1tv5q,hu1tv5q,False,dmatlick,t3_sbluvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ocala/comments/sbluvg/home_builder_recommendations/,Home Builder Recommendations,/r/ocala/comments/sbluvg/home_builder_recommendations/hu1tv5q/,2,r/ocala,0,2

"I'm <30, grew up here, moved away for awhile, am now back. It's a decent place to be, I've never really heard about many crime-ridden areas or anything. This is absolutely not a walking friendly city nor a bike friendly one. There's not much of a college aged population, you're better off hanging around Gainesville to make friends, unless your coworkers are young which they may be.

I do like Ocala because it's a stone's throw away from many nice things & bigger cities. There's definitely stuff to do around here, you just have to seek it out more than you would in a town with a younger population.  My main gripe is basically that there's not many people around my age. Drivers can be really bad too because of that, lol.

Edit: regardless of your political views, you will find that this is a pretty ""political"" town, I guess? Mostly conservative and that will be apparent quickly, since moving back as a young adult I've definitely noticed that you hear a lot of general discourse from strangers in passing.

"Well, sure.  The few women I've heard this from aren't representative of everyone.  That's just what I've been told when I asked.  It honestly spooked me a bit when the phenomenon first manifested itself around 2007ish or so.  As a bearer of a Y chromosome one can only be privvy to so many episodes of Deadly Women, Snapped, whatever before starting to wonder.

For what it's worth, my wife has gotten tired of all the true crime shows and their focus on the same few dozen crimes.  She's moved on to Air Disasters  (aka Mayday outside the U.S.), despite having no real interest in aviation, mostly because it has a similar sounding narrator to Forensics Files (I think that's the show).

"From a 7th generation N Floridian.....

For a 23 yr old, you may find Ocala boring until you make some friends. Hopefully you'll make friends through work quickly. Ocala is comprised of some natives in the surrounding area who've lived there all their lives; and thousands of transplants such as yourself except much older than yourself. It trends upward in average age. The natives can be cliquish. Gainesville is about 50 minutes away and trends younger but a college crowd who aren't all working full time like you will be. There's Orlando about an hour away, a mecca for all ages and anything you might look for. 
Ocala is beautiful nature, outdoors activities, and you don't generally have to worry about crime unless you plan to leave your car unlocked with valuables in it, etc. 
The Ocala National Forest has some crime stories but it also offers hikes and springs. Make a friend and go together!

Ocala is nicely centered in Florida, so you can travel just about anywhere within reason. The springs in Marion are awesome and great fun. 

I'm guessing you might be a Murderino -- so welcome! It is very easy to stay sexy and not get murdered around here.

"Kayaking, hiking, and biking are some of my favorite Ocala activities. 

I recommend getting a cheap kayak and hitting up the Silver River regularly. 

Santos Trail is great for both MTB and street biking.  Long paved paths and great MTB trails.

Ocala National Forest rules.

Appleton Museum of Art for when you need to see fancy art.  Ocala Civic Theater. 

Downtown is OK if you ever wanna do a mini bar crawl. 

Library is great for checking out books and movies for free.

"I believe Ocala is around the average crime rate nationwide. Which isn’t great nor awful. Consider looking at crime rate maps online to wherever you’re planning to live at, and installing a home security system if need be.

I don’t tend to be out late at night, and I haven’t had any problems where I live crime-wise. Many people jog outside throughout the day (not that it equates to safety, but it could be an indicator on how comfortable people living here feel being outside alone).

I’d also look at the Equestrian Centre, especially if you enjoy horses. You can even volunteer at the Humane Society. I currently volunteer there and I absolutely love it. There’s also a park here called Sholom Park. I’ve never been there but I’ve heard it’s really nice. I believe you can also ride down the Silver River.

If anyone feels they are owed money, they can contact me directly at [bigjeffonlineinc@gmail.com](mailto:bigjeffonlineinc@gmail.com) I am 100% sure all terminated and or employees that quit always get there paycheck.. No job is perfect and the grass always looks greener on the other side, and for 1 ex employee that has a issue there are 2 more that do not have one. I started this company out of my 1 car garage 4 years ago and we start employees at 14.00 a hour and pay 3/4 of there insurance after 90 days. I can not count how many employees over time i have lent money to and help them out personally and then i can not count how many have been caught steeling. There is always 3 sides to a story. your side, my side and the full truth. I will say that most employees do not have any issues till after they get fired , then this great job turns into the worst job, and for everyone out there hearing  the one side of this i would say get ll the facts before your assume because i employee over 22 people and if i was to take a poll right now 95% of them would say this is a pretty decent place to work and they are being taken care of. I can not even add up all the money i have spent on people that go to work for a few days or a week and ghost us, and we are not the only ones, that is why everywhere you look is job post and everywhere you go they are under staffed, because there is to many people now that think they are worth 20 plus dollars a hour and have no experience and haven't even put 6 months in a place before they move to the next. I set up 12 interviews a day and 2 show up and each application i look at have same reasons why there last 5 jobs were no good. Here are the facts about Big Jeff Online

1. we have good starting pay
2. we offer benefits
3. we give 40 hours
4. we work Monday to Friday
5. we promote with in 
6. the owner ( ME ) does everything he can to help employees even after he has been screwed over more times than he can count

and in 4 years we have grown to employ over 20 people and about to move to new building and will employee 10 to 15 more..

"We moved here about a year ago. 

Ocala has nice aspects. The restaurants and bars within a block of the downtown square are either terrific (Ivy on the Square, Katya Vineyards) or pure shit (Bank Street). The new equestrian center is interesting. Mostly though its another overgrown windblown city that peaked sometime between the passenger train era and the construction of Disney World. The crumbling old motels and pawn shops along Pine Avenue are a lingering testament to how long discerning travelers simply have preferred to visit nicer places.

"Any opinions are going to be pretty subjective and based on immediate recent experiences.   
As mentioned in another recent post, Greeenfields and Whispering Sands and other divisions like that are to be avoided but a quick check of Google Street View makes that kind of obvious anyway.  Otherwise, it's a real patchwork.

A drive-through of any area should give you an immediate sense of the neighborhood.  Look at how well maintained they are, the condition in which people keep their property and cars.   Look for people out walking and exercising.  If it feels safe enough, stop and ask.

"I never particularly understood the mindset of some people. The article itself is mostly about the voter fraud claims made by trump during his presidency. This part stuck out to me 

>In Florida, Mr. Wilcox said tours of his election office aren’t new, but this year his office has heard from more voters questioning the results and demanding extra audits. Mr. Trump won Marion County with about 62% of the vote in 2020, roughly the same as his 61% in 2016. He carried Florida in both elections.

Many trump supporters in Florida were party to claiming voter fraud on behalf of the president due to his loss. Yet is seems like he managed to take a higher percentage of the votes than his previous election in which he did win. Were trump voter fraud claims true. It would stand to reason that number should be lower, not higher. How do trump supporters and Republicans at large rectify the false narrative they're being fed, with the reality as it exists. Even the comments section on that article is littered with voter fraud claims, despite the article specifically talking about measures that were, and are taken for every election.

"To act as if living in the shores is somehow like living in the hood is ridiculous. Yes they are cheaply built. But it's not terrible. There are a lot of poor people living there and so what. ??  Wages have been on the rise for years so I'm not sure what your even talking about. Nobody works for minimum wage besides teenagers. If you have skills or even just a good work ethic you will be fine. Life is hard. get over it. It's hard everywhere for one person that is true. You know what makes it possible for businesses to pay people less? What if the government allows millions of people to come across the border that will work for less? Why do they do that? What if the government allows people to work part time at Walmart and then subsidies thier food and wages?  These types of polices and others are the problem. Maybe we disagree on some things but ,can you not see what I am talking about. Local policies can not change the dynamics of a government that is selling us out. Both sides I might add for 40 years they have sold us out and you think a local mayor's race is gonna change things? I think not. Also the mayor has done well. We need to build things in the America by Americans . We have to stop relying on other countries to sell us cheap shit. You may not believe me, but in the next few years you will see what the federal government has done. As far as I'm concerned there is no stopping the economic crisis ahead. Inflation has just begun.

"The government giving assistance has nothing to do with businesses paying minimum wage. Which up until September was $8 and change. Now its $10 Thats not enough to live on, and we wonder why people would rather sit on assistance paying more than what they can get working 40 hours a week.

Its physically impossible to live alone in ocala on 90% of the jobs you can get here. 

As for the shores... please... don't bullshit me. I was an electrician wiring houses out there for 4 years. My dad even longer. Half of the houses out there have had my hands in them. I've been on almost every street and I know the condition of the neighborhood and its primary residents. Those houses were built so cheap they're falling apart before the buyers even take ownership. Besides that they're not even remotely worth what they're being sold at, and the labor used to make them wouldn't allow you to afford one. They're being bought up primarily by property managers who are the ones increasing the rent in those areas. You don't even seem to see the changes taking place around you. Dig your head put of the sand and quit blaming the federal government for local politics, and policies.

"Digging for info on gentrification is more effort than I'm willing to invest in this conversation. If that leads you to think I'm bsing you, well oh well. But gentrification is not uncommon. It happens often in major cities. It's what happens when landlords buy up properties, housing prices skyrocket, and the only people who can afford to live in the area are people with higher incomes. Essentially pushing lower income people out. This is already happening. Housing is expensive right know. Really expensive. Just keeps going up. Lower incomes are being pushed to the shores, marion oaks and further.

Living conditions don't magically get better because of a big horse park. Even if it increased tourism. If that increased influx of money doesn't go to the residents.

"I’m closer to Ocala, but I personally see a psychiatrist with telehealth calls through Orlando Psychiatric Association, if you haven’t decided on a doc yet I highly recommend seeing if they’re an option for you!!

We moved here from VA immediately after I went through something extremely tragic and it was causing a lot of doctors to question if I was “able to handle” adderall, despite the fact that being taken off it after some consistency and being fed a bowl of antidepressants instead is what led to that tragic thing. My resistance to antidepressants made a lot of docs think I was a crazy drug addict who was feening for her addy, but I really was just tired of my meds destroying my body if I already knew what worked. 

The doc I’m seeing now through them took aaaaall of that in stride and was very understanding, now I see her once a month and the calls are super quick even when I want to talk about a dosage change (which never prompts the terrifying addict conversation) she’s like yeah you know your brain and body let’s try it.

"You seem to leave out important parts and the ones you included are either how the service general works and actually courteous of the driver. The only thing that can't be denied or proven without more evidence is how they drove.

Drivers tend to be early because that's better than being late. Unless you were told that you'd be charged extra for them waiting due to arriving early then what they did was a good thing. And again, unless they did something to merit it, there was no reason for you to rush.

Asking for flight numbers is how drivers can get the most accurate info on the flights and make adjustments accordingly. Say something happens to the flight, they can look up the number and see what happened that way you're not being dropped off at the original time when in fact the plane was delayed, leaving you waiting for three hours that you could have saved. I took multiple shuttle rides to Orlando Airport a few months ago and they asked for this info every time. Not much of a hassle considering everything is on the ticket and just have to read it off.

Maybe you're right that the ride was as bad as you claim it to be. This is just a random online person, let alone on Reddit, claiming one side of a story though. Please show evidence of your claims so there's no doubt.
