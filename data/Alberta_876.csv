"You’re coming at the BEST age for travelling with a baby. Old enough they have a schedule of sorts you can plan around, young enough they don’t insist on being left to roll on the floor all the time and are pretty happy to be in a baby carrier a ton. 

My favourite things to do with babies are the zoo and hiking. If you’re somewhat experienced with hiking and can wear the baby, even moderately difficult trails can be done with some preparation. If you’re a novice hiker or expect to need to bring the stroller anywheres, stick to the easy paved/boardwalk routes. 

If your diaper bag doesn’t have an option to be worn as a backpack, I do recommend getting a cheap backpack to use for the trip. I’m on baby #3, I like the ones with a laptop pocket in the back that can be used to hold a change mat and keep the diaper supplies separate from the changes of clothes and the snacks. 

Large Ziploc bags are excellent for stashing soiled clothes in when you’re on the road.

At 6 months baby is supporting themselves enough my preference is to wear them in a soft structured carrier, not the wraps that are awesome for the floppy newborn phase. Infantino makes a good one that’s reasonably priced. 

Pack n Play is the way to go for a safe sleep space while you’re here. 

Call your airline and check what kind of plane you’ll be on. I forget which one it is that has them, but some planes have a bassinet you can use if you’re sitting in the bulkhead row. It’s SO GOOD. Flight attendant sets it up once you’re at cruising altitude, baby hangs out and naps or squirms in the bassinet until it’s time to land. 6 months they’re just getting squirmy enough that flying is more challenging than when they are a newborn. 

I have super mixed feelings on car seat situation. On the one hand, if you bring your own it could be damaged while flying and then it’s a huge pain to file the claim with the airline and get it replaced. But on the other, it’s usually fine. As a general rule I’m on team gate check the travel system because of how much time it saves you at the baggage claim. If you plan to travel regularly and/or have more kids in future, it’s worth spending a bit of money for the gate check/travel bags for your travel system. 

I’ve also had it happen where the car seats available from a car rental company were not at all what I was expecting. So if you do plan to rent, get whoever you’re renting from to send you a photo of the seat they plan to have you use. At 6 months, most babies are still in a bucket seat, but if your kid is big and already in the Stage 2 seat PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CALL AND GET A PHOTO BEFORE YOU COME WITHOUT A SEAT. 

As far as restaurants go, just go where you want. Most places will have high chairs available, if you want to be extra you can get one of the ones that clips on to the table to bring with you, but it’s super not necessary. Places with bench seating are good for letting baby stretch out a bit while you’re eating. If you have earlier dinners you should be able to get baby to bed at a decent time and then play cards or watch movies or just have some time together.

If you can avoid packing diapers, do. Like, pack enough in the diaper bag for your trip out + another day but have his family pick up a box or stop at a grocery store and buy a box when you get out here because they take up SO MUCH SPACE. 

As far as time zones go, babies give zero fucks about them. So unless you’re staying for several weeks, expect baby to just keep functioning on whatever time zone you started in as far as naps and meal times and bed time are concerned.

"Remember that when we teach politics to kids we give a balanced and fair approach to both sides of the spectrum.

"There are some affordable EV cars now and coming. People don't want them because the range is too poor, charging takes too long and unsure how they perform in a winter climate.

There needs to be more innovation in the battery tech. It will get there. Only a matter of time. But until that happens, mainstream adoption will be slow.

There was a really good thread on Reddit recently from an EV owner who actually sold his EV and went back to ICE over these problems. I'll see if I can find it.

">	Data shows 95 per cent of oil and gas sites certified as reclaimed have never been inspected by provincial officials.

This is an intentionally shocking statistic meant for people who have absolutely no fucking idea what they’re talking about.

Hi, I’m a professional engineer (registered P.Eng. with APEGA) and my whole job is cleaning up oil and gas sites. I’ve signed a couple Reclamation Certificate declarations myself and put my stamp on more than a few reports. I put my own professional expertise behind this.

Sites don’t need an official government inspection to be certified. All current reclamation certificates do have to be signed off by a professional. If you are found to have lied, you are both professionally and legally fucked in every sense of the word. And most professionals take their jobs extreme seriously.

The part wher I would disagree especially is over the switchover to office-only reviews, because the actually sketchy reclamations are the ones where an inspector went out and said “yah I guess it looks ok”. We find contamination in areas that “look ok” All. The. Time. It’s not the government inspections that make things look “better”, it’s the amount of diligence and testing that is now done, especially the last decade or so. There are lots of times where I get a file that looks like “eh it could be fine” on the surface that I decide that needs more testing that comes back actually contaminated. That’s what most diligent professionals are doing; we’re doing enough to make sure we find the contamination or test enough to prove it’s not there.

The other thing to note is that most contamination isn’t what you think. Most of the contamination that we find isn’t oil (hydrocarbons). It’s salt. I’m not a geologist, but my understanding is that hydrocarbon formations are sometimes mixed with brackish water (many are ancient oceans I think?), so when you pump it up it’s mixed with extremely salty water that is typically sodium chloride (like table salt). This is typically what we see for contamination at wellsites: chloride.

From a contaminant affect perspective, chloride affects two major pathways/receptors: it affects vegetation growth (especially crops that are not salt resistant, I’ve seen areas where it was obvious from stubby wheat) and can affect “groundwater” (loosely speaking … hydrogeologicaly it’s more like perched water). 

In groundwater, Alberta Environment defines 4 “pathways” of interest: drinking water, aquatic life, irrigation, and dugouts. Drinking water means well water, and the truth is most shallow formations in Alberta are not suitable for wells (they just don’t produce enough water to be considered an aquifer layer). Aquatic life means transportation of the chloride to a water body that has some kind of aquatic life (fish, benthic organisms, it’s often the call of an ecologist). Irrigation means … watering crops, but that’s also dependent on the water being useful for that and most shallow groundwater is actually too naturally salty (high TDS and sulphates). Dugouts have to have groundwater at a reasonable depth to be operable.

Many of these come down to professional interpretation. It’s not actually as simple as “this number is bad” because the science supports modification of guidelines in certain cases (this is in fact part of what my professional expertise is). The AER and AEP review these quite closely.

There’s a lot more safeties in place than this guy is saying.",t2_3c9z0szg,kaclk,0,1648253479.0,0,t1_i24uh1g,i24uh1g,True,CapableSecretary420,t3_to66zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/to66zz/stonewalled_alberta_ignored_warnings_about_oil/,"Stonewalled: Alberta ignored warnings about oil and gas cleanup, ex-government scientist says",/r/alberta/comments/to66zz/stonewalled_alberta_ignored_warnings_about_oil/i24uh1g/,6,r/alberta,0,6

">the ""renovation"" the landlord did was a slap of paint on the walls and a new carpet, that's it.

Our landlord just informed us last weekend he intends to sell as he's getting old, we've been renting the place for 11 years, so we said we're interested in buying it. 

So, in the meantime we start looking at what's available in the area we are in just in case, turns out there's a decent selection here in the SE/SW of Calgary, great. Ok, so $450k-$550k gets us a place with renovations done, a garage on most, finished basements and other upgrades. Sweet, well since we do like where we live, best to make an offer. We've offered the landlord $400k for the place because it's builder grade, original everything, no finished basement, no renovations, no garage. 

They have had a realtor walk-thru because he wanted an appraisal, we haven't heard from the landlord yet, but I get a feeling he thought it was worth $450k because of the ""hot market"" .. well, no, the market has slowed in the last few weeks according to the realtors we've talked to, no real crazy bidding wars, yes the inventory sells fairly quickly, but for asking price or slightly over, but not by a huge margin.

My guts telling me the landlord didn't really do much research on the comps in the area, he just said ""well we're not going to be asking $500k"" .. but maybe he thought he'd get $450k. 

We're hopeful he accepts our offer, we spelled out why we made the offer we did pointing out all the things we know the house needs with one of the majors being a new furnace in the next couple of years since it's the original furnace in a nearly 30 year old house. We know the house, we like the area, and we'd rather not move but $400k is the max we're willing to pay realizing we'd be sinking $80-$100k into it over the next decade to renovate it before we sell.",t2_35xfi,BCTripster,0,1648253321.0,0,t1_i24u59w,i24u59w,False,smittenmashmellow,t3_tnjzo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/tnjzo4/albertas_housing_market_with_influx_of_ontario/,Alberta's housing market with influx of Ontario residents.,/r/alberta/comments/tnjzo4/albertas_housing_market_with_influx_of_ontario/i24u59w/,2,r/alberta,0,2

"I wouldn't bank on prices going crazy or increasing over this year. We have multiple rate hikes ahead, a weak economy, and seemingly a lack of growth to facilitate higher prices for long. I mean, according to rbc which is the number 1 mortgage lender in Canada, over 2/3rds of all buyers in the past year have been investors/2nd homeowners. If only 1/3rd of all sales come from people that actually need housing rn, how tf would it keep increasing much longer if you can only rely on speculators and secondary owners for fueling the rocket. Canada already is one of the most overpriced markets, on the back of the highest debt to gdp levels in history....but yeah sure, housing is gonna go wild another year, just the opposite direction for once.

Edit: also to address those moving for cheaper housing, that actually applies to a small minority. Most cannot work from home which dramatically limits those that move. Plus beyond essentially 2 cities, most smaller towns lack the vast majority of amenities that one might expect from out east, which is further hindered by smaller wages in towns, and higher cost of living beyond housing.

Oh? This ought to be interesting.

>	There were some hard economic realities and public opinion realities that Alberta has had to deal with. 

I’m not sure you’re on the right path here. Which realities and opinions do you refer to, and are they actual problems or not? For example: the UCP’s stance on the carbon tax is a manufactured problem. The deficit is a manufactured problem.

>It was stupid to fall for the lie that we didnt have to  deal with them and JK would make it all go away, 

Alright, good that you recognize that it was always a lie and it was not smart to ignore it, do go on.

>but Alberta isnt the only place to elect a populist leader on bullshit promises

So what, we’re just gonna hide behind Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Ontario and hope they take the blame for this? Or maybe because the US elected Trump that makes it okay for Albertans to wilfully ignore their criminal behaviour? I cannot follow this logic. 

I’m not being very kind here and I’m sorry, but you cannot defend this.

"To rephrase my earlier question, why spend so much time commenting about the 'what is', but avoiding any dialog about what ought to be? I agree you have provided a factual explanation of the companies rationale, but, given that said rationale involves continuing to be financially involved with a country that has recently murdered Ukrainian civilians and directly threatened what little semblance of world peace we have managed to achieve, it's objectively shitty of them. Russia is doing terrible things, the least that the rest of the world can do is cut all economic ties. No matter the cost to the global economy, it would hurt Russia more. All these little companies we make exceptions for are (in this case, literally and figuratively) fueling Russia, but that's something it would also seem we agree on... After all, you admitted that this choice is inarguably unethical. Yet, you meet those that condemn it as such with this oppositional ""well, actually..."" approach.

"Sharing the latest COVID19 Wastewater trends from the [Centre for Health Informatics](https://covid-tracker.chi-csm.ca/)

* The first plot is YYC, the second is all locations sampled in Alberta.

In general, we continue to see increasing SARS-CoV2 RNA in the wastewater samples across many areas of the province including: Calgary, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat. Edmonton seems to remain relatively stable.

Some of the smaller urban centres / towns don't have historical data going back as far as Calgary, but I thought it was interesting to plot the Calgary data going back to Jul 1 2021 (best summer ever!) for interest:

* While the RNA shedding from Omicron may be different than Delta, the current wastewater samples indicate similar levels to the Delta wave peak, and are comparable to mid-December in Calgary.

Looking at hospitalization numbers from December, it took almost three weeks for hospitalizations to rise following wastewater increases; we may start to see more individuals hospitalized in the next weekly update on Wednesday. (But let's hope not!)

">  Our landlord decided to sell and then evicted us (family of four) 

That was my experience as well.  I lost my job and apartment before the pandemic and moved into my mom's apartment as she had an extra room and needed the help with rent.  Our landlord decided to take advantage of the huge boom in GTA house prices and started offloading their dozen or so properties around town.  We were told in June or July that they were planning to sell, and that they wanted us out by October/November so they could renovate and sell.  We looked around town and anything similar in size to what we had was now at least $500-700 more a month than what we were paying.  

I started widening the search area until I started looking at different cities, and then cities in other provinces.  I leaned more towards Montreal or Quebec City, but I have two brothers who were already living in Edmonton and my mom could more easily transfer to a job here with her company (my mom also doesn't speak French).  We're paying less now for a larger apartment than what we had back in Ontario. 

Oh, and about our old place, the ""renovation"" the landlord did was a slap of paint on the walls and a new carpet, that's it.

"This was such a BS move. I will admit I voted for him in 2019 because I saw UCP as the lesser of the two evils at the time, nothing to do with his play dress up as a cowboy and drive around southern 'Berta in his shiney new pick-em-up truck holding his town halls. The image never spoke to me; it honestly felt a little condescending that that's how this former Ontario politician viewed his new constituents.

Then with all this leadership review happening I was excited because I had a chance to send not only him, but the party a strong message about what I feel this UCP party should represent. But then I found out that I needed to be at the AGM in person to vote. I wasn't/couldn't take time off, nor did I feel I could justify the travel or hotel expense just to voice my opinion which may not actually matter in the long run. And he was 100% counting on this type of apathy to secure his leadership role.

Now, less than two weeks out it turns out that they are going to use a mail in ballot system like they should have in the first place.

(Almost) all of them think anti-covid measures are bullshit until somebody they know (or themselves) ends up in the hospital or dying. Then they switch to ""Why didn't somebody tell us it was so bad?!""

I still shake my head about the people who think life was worse under the NDP and the UCP made a single thing better.  The NDP implemented so many policies that just made life easier/cheaper for the average person:

* car insurance rate caps
* electricity rate caps
* removal of school fees (up to $400 per child)
* removal of school transportation fees (~$150 per child)
* limiting the increase on course fees in schools
* Energy efficiency incentives and rebates funded by the Carbon Tax
* expanding school lunch program for kids in need
* increased child subsidy, and worked towards expanding a daycare subsidies to reduce the cost of daycare
* capped post-secondary tuition increases
* capped superintendent salaries in Alberta

and so on... they did so many things that directly put money into the pockets of families and individuals (my list is focused on family type stuff, but there was way more), and conservatives screamed about how much the NDP was taking from them.

The UCP came to power, removed the caps on insurance, electricity, tuition increases. Reinstated school and transportation fees, removed the cap on course fees in schools, killed the green energy rebate program. Killed the school lunch program (then brought a lesser form back after outrage)

You said it!

Here's the list I've come to accept when it comes to ""WTF is Alberta's problem?"". It's a complex issue, so there's no catch-all cause, but I think I've recognized just about all of them at this point. I welcome any additions you might have. :-p


- **Abusive Politics** - [I have a theory that decades of Conservative governments have resulted in to this province heavily relying on externalizing hate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/tl35mj/vote_on_premier_jason_kenneys_fate_as_ucp_leader/i1uys3b/) *Basically decades of an abusive political relationship comprised of propaganda and gas lighting.*

- **Greed** - Most Conservatives have the ""one day I'll be rich"" mentality. I believe the quote is ""They look at the big fancy house and don't think 'he sure is lucky'. They look at it and think 'one day that'll be me!'"". This means policies that screw over the working class are often accepted/ignored and policies that help businesses, corporations and the rich are applauded. ""If we reduce taxes on the wealthy, it'll help me when I'm one of them"". (The Canadian Dream. They call it a dream because you'd have to be asleep to believe it. *RIP George*)

- **Hate** - Most Conservatives will accept negative policies if they believe groups they oppose will suffer more. The religious have sinners, the capitalists have the poor, the racists have the immigrants, the old have the young, and they all hate the lefties. So when obviously negative policies are put in place that impact them too, they ignore it because they believe it's hurting the people they dislike even more. (IE: Own the Libs, Leopard Ate My Face). 
- **Religion** -  I won't go deep into this as I don't need the death-threats, but it's no surprise the bible thumping crowd is Conservative and stick together like a shit on a carpet.
- **Education** - While we (currently) have a decent education system, there has traditionally been a strong push towards the Trades due to our Oil and Gas industries. Looking at our other GDP drivers, they're also mostly labour jobs. These people likely don't have an advanced education or knowledge of things like Finances, Economics, Sociology, Law, etc. (and certainly not at a Provincial level). So they work with the limited insight they do have (*My budget at home should be balanced and so should the province!*) and ""trust"" their party to do what's best for them. 
- **History** - Alberta used to be ""the West"" and that comes with a lot of frontier/cowboy baggage that's never been dropped. The good old cowboys used to pull themselves up by their bootstraps (even though it's impossible) and defend their land with a bit of Shoot Shovel and Shut up. So when a government offers social supports (like housing, addition support, environmental protection) that's a terrible lefty government wasting hard earned tax money of soft commie shit. We need things to be STRONG like the cowboys and we love when a guy in blue tells us how STRONG AND FREE our province and economy are, even when it's a lie.

"Same story, opposite directions.

When we travelled with our baby, on our first day we hit up a 2nd hand store (""once upon a child"") and bought a used pack and play to throw in our rental car and use in hotels/airbnb.  Saved us having to worry about whether or not each location would have a crib available (most don't).  Then you get better sleep because you aren't worried about your baby rolling out of a hotel bed.  If your plan is to start your trip with family, maybe ask them if they can borrow/loan stuff like this for you to use.  Anything they can get for you locally saves you having to bring it.  Same goes for a car seat.  Airlines will let you check one but if you can borrow one locally, it saves you a lot of hassle in the airport.

Bring a stroller, even if you won't need one here, they are almost necessary in an airport, and you can check it for free.

Having a laundry plan is also helpful. If you can't make sure one of your stays has laundry available, find a laundromat somewhere mid-trip.  You use even more cloths/clothing on the road for cleanup than you are used to at home, since diaper changes aren't as easy/reliable.

Don't stress about what strangers think.  Yes, it feels bad if your baby starts crying in a restaurant, or a hotel room, or on a plane, but honestly it's so much harder for you than the stranger who might have to (gasp) put their headphones in or something.  It's tough travelling with a baby, don't be hard on yourself.

Pack extra clothes and towels in your carry on as well as a few plastic bags for soiled clothing.  The large, freezer ziploc bags help.  On our first flight, my kid had a shit so big and so wet that it leaked out of the diaper on to my wife, while we were sitting on the tarmac for over an hour waiting for take-off.",t2_dwq9q,Roche_a_diddle,0,1648232825.0,0,t1_i23i4w3,i23i4w3,True,cvxmh,t3_tnrcvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/tnrcvx/traveling_in_alberta_with_baby/,Traveling in Alberta with Baby,/r/alberta/comments/tnrcvx/traveling_in_alberta_with_baby/i23i4w3/,6,r/alberta,0,6
