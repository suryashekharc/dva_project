"Omg, all driving faux pas are the worst here (and I've lived and driven in LA, Bay Area, NYC, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore/D.C., and Dallas), it's something about Seattle's not too distant past as a provincial city. These include:

- Sudden u-turns in the middle of a commercial street
- inability to make a left turn without a turn arrow
- backing up to parallel park when cars are passing
- inability to merge at the end of a freeway entrance
- driving below the speed limit
- dashing to enter your lane right in front of you despite there being no cars behind you and then proceeding to drive below the speed limit
- not moving towards the curb when making right turns
- being passive aggressive on the freeway and speeding up to block people who just want to pass them because they're driving slowly in the fast lane
- and the very worst thing: abruptly slamming on the brakes without any warning and with complete disregard to cars behind them in order to be ""courteous"" and let a pedestrian cross even when the pedestrian isn't planning to cross and isn't even close to the curb, ""just in case.""",t2_bg8l2,su6oxone,0,1648293045.0,0,t1_i26htlh,i26htlh,True,pnwtrailbitch,t3_toj1pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/toj1pm/what_is_it_about_seattle_area_drivers_that_makes/,What is it about Seattle area drivers that makes them feel entitled to camp in the passing lane?

"Counter-points: I am a Licensed Home Inspector who works in the Seattle Area.

2: An Increasing number of Seller are doing Pre-Listing Inspections, it's ballooned to be a large portion of my business. The last two years, it's been rush to do pre-offer inspections, now, some smart listing agents, have realized that to give the pre-listing inspection helps more people waive more contingencies, and push more bidders into the pool.

4: Twice this week I've got to bed, and woken up at 6 to agents asking if I had time to squeeze in a pre-offer inspection same day.  In fact I just got TWO as I was typing up this response. 

It has not always been this way. When I started inspecting 7 years ago, it was all post contract that I'd be called in to do inspections, Summer of 2019 a good 25% of my work was pre-inspections, and I'd do 5 a day. Summer 2020 40% of my business was pre-inspections, last year it stayed about the same, but the pre-listing inspections started to tick up to 15%, and this year a solid 30% of my inspections are pre-list, and 60% are pre-offers.  In 2020 and 2021, we'd see multiple inspectors at the same house during the same time period. Mostly in core areas, West Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Mercer Island, now we see them not as rarely but more often in non-core areas.

In this climate, to be able to service as many clients as possible, I don't schedule anything for Saturday until Friday afternoon, and don't schedule anything Sunday until Saturday afternoon.  This allows me to be flexible and fit into open house schedules and available show time schedules.

Just some final thoughts, There are a lot of comments about a pre-list not being done because of disclosure issues, or the fact that it could drive down the price. That's not the reality of the situation. People are waiving all these contingencies, the pre-list inspection actually helps create a liability shield for them, because they DID disclose, and they did warn the buyers, they just made it clear that it's AS-IS with these issues, plus they can then refuse any kind of back-end negotiations. In 2020 and 2021, even if I was in a ""Pass/Fail"" inspection, if something big came up, the buyers would try to negotiate on big items, even it was just asking for a home warranty.  Now the seller can say, hey look you had this information before you even made an offer.

If your agent doesn't have a stable of Inspectors to be able to get you one out in 36 hours, then your agent probably isn't very agile, and may be coaching you on making weak offers.",t2_3qu7nzyt,LordAshon,0,1648274370.0,0,t1_i25w4ea,i25w4ea,True,someOfUsDontGet2Rest,t3_tny4dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tny4dq/why_are_sellers_refusing_to_have_oreinspection/,Why are sellers refusing to have ore-inspection done on properties?,/r/SeattleWA/comments/tny4dq/why_are_sellers_refusing_to_have_oreinspection/i25w4ea/,2,r/SeattleWA,1,2

The same way you erode any other right.  

Enact more and more restrictions and regulations under the guise of bullshit when the true goal is to eliminate the right entirely.

You must get an ultrasound, you must go to a specific facility, the facility has to follow specific regulations, it must be close enough and partnered with other facilities, you can't get one after a certain amount of time, etc.

"I was interested in that, and searched for more articles, and I even found a copy of the bill. It sounds like the specific tasks and projects that will be funded will be determined later, with a grants system? I hope there is good oversight. In Portland, they approved a citywide 'green jobs/climate' bill where they are taxing profits over $1 million. It is bringing in more revenue than expected, but this funding seems to go to groups that are able to apply for the grants. I think it would be the most fair if they were to decide 'all apartments are eligible for heat pumps' and then make sure all who are eligible can get it, rather than it sort of devolving into a spoils system, or going to the most informed people who get to the front of the line. https://www.opb.org/article/2022/03/10/portland-clean-energy-fund-program-audit/

"GPS works by calculating the time it takes for the signal to reach your device/receiver from 4+ satellites. Based on how long it takes it can determine the distance the signal traveled and with some geometry, can calculate your position. 

GPS needs line of sight and you need to be able to have line of sight with atleast 4 GPS sattlites to get an accurate position. With most mapping apps they use a combination of GPS and cellular to maintain location and cellular/wifi to get the map. 

The GPS signal will also bounce off of buildings sending the same signal to your receiver with different timings causing what is called multipath. So even when you have clear line of sight you can still get errors when surrounded by tall buildings. Driving in a downtown area with spotty cell coverage will lead to all kinds of incorrect and missing location data causing your location on your map to be highly inaccurate.",t2_fj8p0,JohnnyAF,0,1648257060.0,0,t1_i251vrx,i251vrx,True,Koljaka,t3_tnelbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tnelbu/could_someone_please_explain_what_is_wrong_with/,Could someone please explain what is wrong with this area that Google Maps navigation goes crazy here and during driving it could not detect your precise location?,/r/SeattleWA/comments/tnelbu/could_someone_please_explain_what_is_wrong_with/i251vrx/,2,r/SeattleWA,0,2

"WA State has already passed a law requiring panel manufacturers to offer recycling, although it looks like the details of the program are still being hammered out. There are not a lot of panels reaching the end of their useful life yet, because it takes 25 years or more for that to happen.

it looks like it might cost about $25 per panel to recycle. That's between $250-750 for most residential installations around here. So I guess you could factor that in if you are skeptical that the WA law will ever get implemented.

"We have had solar for 4 years. It’s awesome. We used Brimma Solar. The panels when we purchased were about 1k a panel, average house probably needs between 12-20 panels depending on your energy usage. Since we have purchased ours the price has actually gone down about 30 percent and the panels themselves are about 25 percent more energy producing. So now is a good time to buy. We got in when there were a lot of incentives. It actually offset the cost of our system by 75 percent over 8 years. So we paid up front but we get a kick back from the state as well as PSE. PSE also buys our extra energy so we get credits for the sunny months in summer we can use in the winter. John Harley at Brimma Solar is a great guy and he made it really easy.

"> No, Progressives do not think the situation is acceptable.

Are you sure? I was happily calling myself a progressive in 2016 but political discourse has changed and I no longer feel comfortable identifying myself this way. I can't be alone in distancing myself from certain labels and questioning my own political affiliations because of the way people under the ""progressive"" label behave. My neighborhood groups here and in another city I briefly lived over the past few years are full of people shaming others if they show concern over open drug use in front of their homes, repeated offenders attacking people in the neighborhood, repeated home invasions, car break-ins, vandalism, stealing, etc. It's at the point where you can't even say you are unhappy something bad happened to you without someone saying you're a bad person for not realizing the offender has worse problems.

I am all for a better safety net but I also believe something more than a safety net needs to be provided for those who are mentally ill or dealing with substance addictions that make a safety net too flimsy to support their needs. A safety net will give people resources if they seek them out; people with serious mental health or substance abuse problems are not going to seek out resources on their own. They need a more forceful approach.

>  Maybe we could make progress on this issue if we focused on common goals (locking scumbags up, safer and cleaner streets)

But that's the problem; a lot of progressives that I speak to these days do not support locking people up for almost any reason and they do not want safer, cleaner streets if it means moving ""unhoused neighbors"" off of them. Just look at the platform and support for Thomas-Kennedy in the recent election. Her supporters, the ""progressives,"" were the ones bringing political ideology into conversations and yelling that anyone who didn't support her or her platform was a Trump supporter.

I would really like to have some actual conversations about solutions. I don't understand how we have come to a point where any solution other than giving people free apartments can't even be discussed in progressive circles. How have vocal liberals managed to take what seems to me to be a complex issue and flattened it into one where your moral character is judged and arguments are thrown out if you suggest that some people might need to be put in a long-term facility (for treatment, ideally, but for some cases, I think it's more important to stop their violence regardless of whether they are treated) rather than assuming they're just down on their luck because rent is kind of high.",t2_4qp0g,madddhella,0,1648248261.0,0,t1_i24j4vq,i24j4vq,False,unnaturalfool,t3_tnl4xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tnl4xa/woman_62_attacked_in_seattle_light_rail_station/,"Woman, 62, attacked in Seattle light rail station asks judge to keep suspect jailed",/r/SeattleWA/comments/tnl4xa/woman_62_attacked_in_seattle_light_rail_station/i24j4vq/,11,r/SeattleWA,0,11

"Thanks for providing that perspective! And congratulations on the purchase!

There is a common sentiment here that don’t trust the sellers pre-inspection if there is one. It’s true. 

There is another piece to this, using inspector that your agent recommends also is a risky slope. There was a post not that long ago where a person trying to get into inspection business tried to meet with agents and realtors to promote his business and was surprised that many of them wanted an inspector who would toe the line. Not deceive but also not point out egregious problems to buyers. Basically, help the deal to be successful and not let it fall apart.

There are always independent inspections buyers can have done. But,everything has to line up for that. You have to essentially have an inspector ready to come on less than a day’s notice AND property has to be on the market that long AND you have to do that for every property until your offer gets accepted.

"I moved back to Seattle on January 2nd (I left after college in 2013) and was gone on February 14th for the following reasons:  the second day I was there my car got stolen …. My concierge laughed when I said the police were on their way to make a report (which they arrived 6 hours later after I called a second time). He said “yah I wouldn’t rely on SPD” . 

So I became a private investigator and went to every single building that had a camera on the street downtown it was stolen on and left my number and had like 12 building security staff helping me and one company had clear footage of the incident and I showed the police who did nothing meanwhile I’m literally in a screaming match with my insurance claim adjuster (progressive never again) who was telling me essentially I’m committing fraud because I had just changed my policy the day before when I arrived in Washington because I needed in state insurance, my State Farm team couldn’t help me anymore cause I was not in the same state. 

So basically he considered it a fraudulent claim because the next morning my car got stolen. Luckily when they dumped it, they parked it illegally and it got towed and the towing company called me and I recovered it. 

But what disgusts me the most is all the misery I saw. No one smiles, there was always some tweaker holding up the line anywhere I went, I saw a dude laying down with his ass out shitting… I saw a lot of public defecation  actually……. And I could not - absolutely could not - get my medications in a realistic way. I take 90 tablets a month of a med and I’d go in and they have the script and the pharmacy would be like oh we only have 11 today so I’m like alright I’ll take the 11 l, which closes the script so to get my one month of meds it took 9 prescriptions and I even tried different pharmacies and last being pretentious means you’re insecure. I come from old generational wealth and don’t even need to work if I didn’t want to but I’m not a pretentious dick head. I literally just laughed at so many people who thought they were hot shit. I’m all for feeling good about yourself and looking nice, but the attitudes and the absolute non-existent middle class. 

I hated every day I lived there and I left in the middle of the night in the pouring rain and just paid my 18 month lease in full and cut my losses. I’m so happy to be back in my home city. 

Also the drivers up there are suicidal. I loved going to college there back in the day and loved all the tall buildings but now I just realize seattle has a crack addiction to development and it’s disgusting.

"There's a [recent ST article that lays it out fairly well](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/seattle-area-contractors-working-for-sound-transit-and-others-turn-to-ghost-trucks-to-dodge-concrete-strike/) and refers to them as ghost trucks. I'm in DT Bellevue near a bunch of high rise projects that have been very quiet or even completely stalled since December, and as of last week everything's busy again. There are tons of these 'ghost trucks' all over the place. They started coming in maybe two weeks ago or so. There was a brief scuffle the first weekend at one site near our place, with about 20 striking drivers trying to keep a concrete truck from pulling up to the site, but now I'm seeing trucks at all the big downtown projects, sometimes 5 or 6 all lined up at one site.

The highlight from the article is:

>As a costly labor dispute between concrete mixer drivers and Seattle-area concrete suppliers has dragged on for months, local contractors are turning increasingly to nonunion drivers to get concrete to projects, including at several for Sound Transit.  
>  
>The use of “ghost trucks,” as union members call them, began quietly and went largely unnoticed soon after the strike by 330 Teamsters drivers began in early December.  
>  
>But the controversial practice, which often involves bringing in out-of-area drivers to operate some of the estimated 300 local mixer trucks owned by several of the six local suppliers, has become evermore standard for contractors as talks between Teamsters and the companies have stalled.  
>  
>Across the Seattle area, ready-mix trucks, some with their company logos taped over, have been delivering thousands of cubic yards of concrete to projects ranging from apartment high-rises to transit lines.

Besides those, there are some [union drivers that agreed to go back to supply critical projects like the West Seattle Bridge](https://westseattleblog.com/2022/03/concrete-strike-drivers-say-theyll-return-to-work-at-3-companies-without-a-settlement-to-allow-concrete-to-flow-to-critical-projects-including-west-seattle-bridge/).",t2_h78sti7s,Wax_Phantom,0,1648246107.0,0,t1_i24eabf,i24eabf,True,FreshEclairs,t3_tnp9qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tnp9qa/concrete_driver_strike_over/,Concrete driver strike over?,/r/SeattleWA/comments/tnp9qa/concrete_driver_strike_over/i24eabf/,3,r/SeattleWA,0,3

"(Person of color)
I grew up in a big family here in Washington State. Back in the day we were called all sort of names because of being child of a Mexican mother and a white father. We didn’t struggle for food or anything because a value was installed in us by our Parents. Simple but harsh but true. “No white man will just give you a chance you got to make that chance, not by cheating, not by selling drugs or stealing. No we in this family don’t follow that road, we go to school and work harder than the other people. We keep our eyes focused on the goal of beating the system that was created to keep you low. Look at our family background in both sides, owners of companies, doctors, professors and engineers. All the Bull crap,you face, all the racist jokes or comments you hear, just keep the prize in your heart. You got family and we got your back. Go out and kick some ass.” 
Would have been easy for us to sell or rob but the hard work paid off. I’m 50 years old and next year I will have saved enough to retire and enjoy my efforts with my beautiful wife.

"This doesn't always occur but in this crazy sellers market it is. It's unfortunate for buyers but that's how it goes. 

It's a sellers market currently. Sellers are usually getting so many offers that they don't have to entertain any with contingencies. It's not that they expect them (maybe they are) but so many buyers are willing to waive them just to get that house. People have put in offer after offer and are willing to waive it all. 

When the market calms down (has to happen at some point right) pre inspections and offers with an inspection contingency (and contingencies in general) will go back to being normal. 

Many houses in the seattle area are doing an ""offer review date"" that is often 5-7 days after the house first goes on the market. It gives all interested parties a deadline to get their offers in. The sellers review everything on that date and chose the offer that makes the most sense for them. 

Sometimes houses could go on the market and the next day get such an amazing offer that the sellers would go pending without waiting for any other offers. If they had already stated there is an offer review date then this isn't really best practice but it does happen. 

And not all houses have an offer review date but in this market it seems like the smart thing to do and what most agents recommend.

"Another tawdry bit of sensationalist and misleading ""journalism"" from Mike Carter of the Seattle Times.  Carter can't bring himself to accurately relate the sequence of events, as they would put the SPD's actions in a reasonable light and make Butts the engineer of his own demise.  Carter fails to explicitly note that Butts fired first, striking an officer in the chest.  The first mention of gunfire is when Officer Elizabeth Kennedy--who Butts shot without warning--""returned fire.""  Kennedy was struck by the first round Butts fired, the first shot fired that day.  Butts retreated and continued to fire even though wounded himself.  Those shots wounded two other officers.  Butts did not at any point signal the intent to surrender.

Buyers can say, no thank you and you keep it.

"Most humans aren't shitty.  Most of us don't attack old women.  Most of us provide for our basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter by participating in our robust specialized economy.  Most of us respect each other's property rights.  Most of us pay our taxes with a minimum of bitching.  Most of us don't commit murder in the interest of protecting our drug turfs, or because we don't like somebody's skin color.

We have two great failings.  

One great failing is that too many among us assume that because the prevalence of some bad behavior is high in some outgroup, that therefore other memebers of that outgroup have that characteristic.  This is how we get from ""the KKK is made up of white people, so white people are racists"" as well as ""the percentage of murders committed by black people is larger than the percentage of black people in the overall population, so therefore black people are murderers""

The other great failing is a derivative of the first great failing.  Because too many people commit the ecological fallacy, some among us overcompensate.  We say, for instance, that because group X has been accused of bad behavior Z when they should not all have, that therefore bad behavior Z is observed, that pointing it out is somehow an example of the ecological fallacy.
