I Ike people like you that will admit things. 
hey I get it. I hate the California people pricing me out of the Phoenix area. I was there during the campsite murders, and the Gabby Petito thing, so yea, ppl were a little extraaa unfriendly I’d say. 

The thing that gets me is, it’s an off roading destination. I was told thats why we were stopping there. Why wasn’t there any other trucks out with there with us? It’s a dream for people across the country to off road there.

"Close to town that's going to be tough to find that exact combination.   If you want to  push your tolerance a little bit, White Rim has great canyon views and some exposure that will make your stomach drop if you walk up to the edge, but it's not a technical 4x4 so nothing more scary than a two-lane highway in the mountains IMO.  A lot of the Sand Flats routes have no exposure, but are a fair bit more technical.   A day permit for the White Rim, is the coolest day trip that is easy and close.

I would recommend for your situation maybe going somewhere a little off the track.

"Potash and Hurrah are probably what I would recommend as well. They definitely do have some cliffs but the views are so worth it. Onion creek is also another fun one that I don't remember have too many cliff elements.

Unfortunately for you, lots of trails (like Hurrah) are accessed by Kane Creek which has a ton of switch backs at the start but honestly really isn't bad once you get past those. Just go slow. 

If you really can't do it, there's still a lot to explore. I'd say go up Sand Flats road and find stuff off of there (there is a lot off of there) or you can always run River Rd (RT 128) and access a lot of BLM land and what not from there.  Besides that, just pick a dirt road and start exploring. 

You can access a lot of trails via FS/dirt roads and some passes but you'll definitely have to take some long ways around to avoid cliffs...

"“We’re wondering what the feelings are with biking with dogs in the area.” 

I’ve always been okay with unleashed dogs on trails with responsible owners that have well behaved and obedient dogs but over last few years with the major influx of people the bags are now everywhere along with lots of dog shit on the trail that’s not even been bothered to get bagged. I’ve also had two incidents recently when I’ve had to deal with aggressive dogs on the trail with one being a large German shepherd. All that being said my opinion has changed and I now agree (as well as practice with my own 3 dogs) all dogs on trails should be leashed.

No issues finding the trail. We came in from Potash Rd. Murphys was fine and had no issues. On the backside of Murphys there was quite a bit of packed snow that stays shaded. Was slick in spots but took it slow and never put on the chains. By mid morning any snow touched by the sun was gone. First night at White Crack when the storm rolled in was borderline sketchy.

"I'm just going to repost my Glassdoor review here. Lots of info about the housing. In regards to the person who said Sorrel had positive Glassdoor reviews, unclear what they were looking at but here is the link:

[https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sorrel-River-Ranch-Resort-Reviews-E281898.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sorrel-River-Ranch-Resort-Reviews-E281898.htm)

Every single positive review was made by a current employee who was either friends with the manager, was coerced to write it, or was too new to know any better. I can literally name the people who wrote the ones during my time and can tell you that every single one of them left very quickly and on bad terms.

&#x200B;

Pros

I am grateful for this anecdote: Liz cut our wages to$10/hr because she ""couldn't afford to pay us,"" and sent my partner to GJ to spend $10k on e-bikes for herself and her husband. She then dragged them down I-70.

Cons

I've wanted to write this review for a year but haven't been able to find words succinct enough to describe this nightmare, and even this leaves out so much.

I began working in May 2020 but lived at Sorrel for a year and a half, until March 2021. My partner worked seasonally for several years, but we were stranded here when our river guiding jobs were canceled due to covid. We were asked to stay to help develop a rafting program and run the Adventure department but instead saw an endless rotation of unqualified ""Guest Experience Managers"" take our positions.

Guiding at Sorrel is appalling. There are no first aid kids, no satellite phones, and everything is falling apart. Liz refused to get new UTVs so I was frequently stranded in them in areas with no cell service, sometimes at night. I was the only guide with any experience or knowledge about southern Utah and there was no training for any of the others. I was forced to use my personal parks pass multiple times - which is so illegal - because no one was around to give me cash for my park entrance fees.

My partner is a very skilled carpenter and worked in unsafe conditions. Most of the tools in the wood shop were his own, and the ones Sorrel did have were barely functional. He had 5-10 successive managers and each was insanely unqualified. They forced him to do general maintenance and fix TVs and ACs most of the time instead of carpentry. He kept this trash pit from falling apart and stayed when Liz cut his wages to $10/hr for two months. He never received a raise. Despite this, Liz contested his unemployment claim and asked why we never developed her river program.

In sum: the entire town hates Sorrel. We cannot count all of the managers (much less staff) who have been fired in the past three years. Everything is outdated and falling apart. Our apartment was in disrepair - the window fell in and shattered, the ceiling began to cave from the rain, the water heater upstairs exploded and flooded the entire apartment, and our neighbor lit the building on fire, ALL WITHIN TWO WEEKS.

Liz is barely on the property but micromanages constantly from Palm Beach. She flaunts her BILLIONS while simultaneously saying she cannot afford to pay us. She wants the staff and housing hidden from guests because we are shameful and gross and not wealthy. She does not understand or value southern Utah, the staff, or her guests.

The entire staff is terrified of being fired and different departments undermine each other. Even when I quit and began working in town, living on this property and in this culture of fear created a traumatic level of stress.

You will be underpaid. You will be undervalued. You will be overworked. You will be so incredibly miserable. Do not work here.

So from my perspective, the #1 thing we need is just a modern system for measuring and accounting for where all the water is going. There are a thousand policy solutions but they all depend on knowing what water people are using and charging them appropriately for it. I can't even imagine the amount of water we lose to evaporation when it's literally just running down the gutter on a 115 degree day and then flood irrigating half vacant lots full of invasive trees.  Infrastructure and budget are the biggest problem our town faces, we know we need better water infrastructure but given there isn't actually a water problem due to the low population here and the fact that other physical infrastructure is also badly out of date it's pretty hard to advocate for the necessary water infrastructure as being the highest priority.  Like if we had a windfall of $25 million water would still probably be at the end of the line.

Personally I think figuring out the revenue problem is where the difficulty lies.   We need more revenue or at least a better us of the revenue we have, and I don't really see many ways forward because of the way the state legislature limits the taxing authority of local jurisdictions.

People have such dramatically different opinions even when viewing the same information it make sit impossible to do anything other than guess and play party politics when we don't have real data on where our water is being consumed.  For example, the report cited above was equally responsible for the reactions ""great, we have plenty of water left"" and ""oh shit, we're almost out of water."".

"lol, okay. If the highway is too scary and the local BLM roads are too intense for a road bike—both plausible assessments—then OP should probably just get a ride into Moab. I would assume there’s a shuttle service to/from the airport, or OP could simply ask a local (or a warmshowers host) for a lift, it’s a small enough town.

I should probably have qualified that bit about Willow Springs—I rode it on a loaded mountain bike and even then I had to walk for long stretches—but OP asked for “realistic” options, so I stand by what I said.

"I lived in Moab for six months a few years back. Should be a super easy ride—less than ten miles on a highway (with lots of semi-trucks…) and then a fun descent into town via bike trail.

If you want to get off the pavement, you can sneak into Arches via a dirt road opposite 313, the paved spur into Canyonlands. It’s maybe nine miles long, but it’s kinda rocky.

The riding in Arches is a little rough: there’s only a threadbare shoulder and a surprising amount of traffic, but it’s very scenic. If you want a gentler ride with nicer vistas, I highly recommend Canyonlands and nearby Dead Horse Point. The roads are wider and there’s a lot less traffic.

If you have the inclination to do a sixty-mile loop on lightly trafficked pavement, I enthusiastically endorse a trip around the La Sal mountains. It’s 4,000 feet of elevation gain, but it gets you far away from the touristy parts of town, and you get to see both the Colorado River and the high-altitude forest.

"If you are working in Moab and are unhoused, the community should do more to support your safety and well being. I would like to see the county and city designate parking areas as a short term solution, and continue to invest in truly affordable housing and requiring employee housing for large employers. The city and county could also explore things like monthly stickers that employers make available to their employees that would signal to law enforcement that the vehicle is in use for this purpose, if people needed to camp at the town ramp or one of the parks. We need these workers and should consider them part of our community.

There is no reason that the community needs to make accommodations for \*visitors\* who choose to stay in their vehicles, regardless of whether they are trust funders or dirt baggers. We are surrounded by public lands where you can stay and there are ample campgrounds and RV parks. If you were planning for a longer stay, see paragraph one and get a local job to participate. Our parks that we pay to maintain are not intended to be your campground.

Residents are already asked to shoulder the burden of increased visitation and impacts on our neighborhoods. We are not responsible for your Vibes.

"“Van Life” as a movement encompasses too many things. People living in vans, by choice, with the means to travel and recreate, are no different than someone in an f350 with a fifth wheel. They should be following camping regs and following LNT and using designated routes and campsites etc.  People who are living in vans because they cannot find housing should be able to avail themselves of social services. I would love to see more low-cost developed rv parking in the area with sanitation and trash pickup, as it could accommodate both of these groups.

"Hey there. I've worked at Sorrel for three years now, and just quit. I made a throwaway account to post this because I don't need them to continue to come after me. Please, I beg you, do not work at Sorrel. Employee housing is a slum, and is so close to the offices that managers and HR will routinely come to your unit and enter without knocking. In my time living in employee housing, I've had over 22 new roommates in my apartment. I never received advance notice that any of them were moving in, except for one. For that one instance, I got 10 hours notice. In my time at Sorrel, I have seen 5 general managers come and go. The current owner has been in charge for 12 years, and has had over 14 general managers. HR will routinely enter your room for 'inspections'. I know others who have had money and even personal items stolen. They open your mail. They steal your packages. Sure, housing is cheap $300/ month and utilities are free, but the power constantly goes out, the internet doesn't work, the water from the pipes tastes like a pool, and housing is so crammed with temporary employees working opposite schedules that everyone is constantly being kept awake and is cranky. This drives employees to point to one another as the problem, rather than the institution itself and the owner. 

The head of housekeeping is best friends with the owner, and she is in charge of employee housing. She's currently being investigated by The Times Independent newspaper in Moab for allegations of sexual assault from some of the workers here on visas. I've heard firsthand from some of these victims that these are not 'just' allegations. 

Further, Sorrel constantly makes empty promises that are never fulfilled. For example, those on visas come from less wealthy countries and often spend a few thousand dollars in transportation to get to the ranch. The ranch will send someone to pick you up at the airport, but when it is time to leave they will not. What's more is that these individuals on visas have to abide by certain work rules, like avoiding tardiness and insubordination, to be able to reapply for a visa somewhere else. What ends up happening is these visa workers end up getting paid almost nothing while being forced to work harder than the Americans at the ranch, because if they complain they could get fired or written up, and may not be eligible for a visa in the future. 

Just this year, we found out that there were three different pay rates among us servers. Some were making $10/hr, others $6/hr, and the visa waiters and waitresses were making just $3/hr. Because they were told not to discuss wages. Sorrel will put you into a constant state of anxiety and contempt. Every day is a battle to get to work and not feel like you're fighting the entire system just by being there. Everyone is embarrassed because the systems are destroyed and no usable connections exist. When a manager or employee brings this up to the owner, they get fired. It is a perpetual motion machine of horror. 

In 2020, the ranch allowed an employee infected with Covid-19 to return to employee housing after receiving a positive test, after just 5 days of quarantine. This resulted in the infection, hospitalization, and death of an employee who was at-risk. Sorrel swept it under the rug. 

In 2019, an employee hung themselves in employee housing because of the working conditions. These are just a handful of the things that have happened since I have been there. I made this throwaway account because I felt like I needed to reach out to you and spread the word. Do not work here. They will tell you things have changed, like they told me. That isn't true. Management has changed, but as long as their jobs are threatened by fulfilling the directives of the owner, nothing will truly change. 

Even if you make it out with your life, you may not make it out without gray hairs or all of your money. As I write this, Sorrel owes me close to 3k that I bet I'll never get to see. There is so much here to unpack, but please take my advice and don't walk away from Sorrel River Ranch....run.",t2_h7vvw1c1,Sea_Management_2389,0,1638635670.0,0,t1_hn7kk2q,hn7kk2q,True,purple_poppy,t3_r5s2tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/moab/comments/r5s2tq/sorrel_river_ranch_employee_housing/,Sorrel River Ranch Employee Housing,/r/moab/comments/r5s2tq/sorrel_river_ranch_employee_housing/hn7kk2q/,10,r/moab,0,10

"Yeah, I get that. As a geologist who enjoys this area, I understand that falling rocks can be a risk to hikers; however, upon viewing the insta reel, I don’t think there was a risk of it falling in the next couple years. With the relatively arid environment that this is and with the effort that it actually took to dislodge the rock, I think that it could have realistically stayed where it was for quite a while longer without it being a “clear and present danger”.

I personally like to advocate the preservation of natural features for future generations and “leave no trace”. Because, actions such as this do alter the landscape, can increase weathering of the cliff face, and if not done carefully can be very dangerous to climbers/hikers. 

I have no idea about the legality of the actions, because I am unfamiliar with Moab‘s laws regarding trundling; however, I think that videos like this can be incredibly dangerous because it can encourage others to do the same who might not be as attentive to those that might be below.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Recently we had an outbreak at our high school that forced it to close. Our hospital (and our entire town really) is extremely short staffed, and the only oxygen supply company in town is now rationing oxygen compressors so we are unable to discharge some patients who require home oxygen. This has left several tourists unable to leave Moab, with their family members stranded here dealing with finding pricy extended stays during what is our peak season. No, it is not slower right now because kids are back in school. 

Even if you plan to camp, and not come into town, and wear a mask, and are vaccinated if ANYTHING happens that requires medical attention you will be adding serious strain to our small rural hospital. We do not have an ICU, Utah hospital ICU's are mostly full, transferring patients does not happen in a timely manner these days. Just stay home. Or maybe go somewhere else?


And for all you locals, be careful out there

*To be clear, I have yet to have a vaccinated patent require transfer to an ICU, or intubation, but this week is the first time I'm seeing them sick enough to require multi-day hospital stays. They are all extremely glad they got the vaccine. I have transfered several unvaccinated patients to the ICU, intubated, and I think about them all the time. All I can say is I hope they are ok. I'm not here to preach about the vaccine. I just want people to be aware of what is going on in our hospital so they can make informed decisions.",t2_8iw71mlw,notasanonymous,0,1632795520.0,0,t1_hejpe0t,hejpe0t,True,SeaLab2050,t3_pvmrmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/moab/comments/pvmrmg/moab_busy_right_now_prefer_blm_land_where_i_can/,Moab busy right now?
