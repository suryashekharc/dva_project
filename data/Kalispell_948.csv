"I vote Sykes for a Chicken Fried Steak as big as your face. Has an old-fashioned diner vibe, bottomless coffee, etc. And I agree that Moose's is great for a unique experience and fantastic pizza. Make sure you order some peanuts and contribute your shells to the sawdust floor (part of the experience). The steak at the Whitefish Lodge is some of the best cuts I've had... but many locals contend that the new Mercantile Steakhouse is now top dog.

"Just hopping in here to say that you should really think about what you are looking for in a community before you move here. I grew up in the Flathead (and I actually really liked it), yet my partner and I can barely tolerate being in the area anymore, even for a weekend visit to our families. Every time we go for a visit, we leave heartbroken at how exhausting everything is now.... traffic is insane, people are horrible drivers and drive like 20+ over the speed limit in residential areas (and if they think you are a liberal, they might try to run you off the road. it's happened)....it is impossible to enjoy the outdoors without being surrounded by hoards of tourists at all times. Businesses that rely on service industry employees can't even stay open because the blue collar workforce is being f\*cked by the price of, well, everything. People are angry, tired, and at the end of their rope. The Flathead Valley is suffocating under the pressure of unprecedented growth. 

The places that were once safe, beautiful, and spiritual for those of us from this area have largely been destroyed by overcrowding, pollution, unsustainable growth, and the collapse of community. Sometimes the amount of grief and loss I feel for the Montana of my childhood nearly drives me to tears. 

The working-class community that raised me is being driven out by out-of-control housing prices.  It was nice to feel like I had a community to back me up. That community is gone.

"Outside of city limits you don't need a building permit. You can do pretty much everything yourself, but you will need an electrician to inspect your wiring, make the final connection to the power box, and to sign it all off.

Plumbing is the same but the only inspection you need is for installing septic and testing the drain field.

Building is pretty crazy right now so if you're hiring a contractor you'll want to get in touch with whoever you choose and get the ball rolling soon.

"I officially moved here 2019 so I consider myself a newcomer. However, my extended family's been here for decades so I have significant roots to build from.

I can't afford rent so I am homeless and live in a vehicle. This is my unorthodox solution to the housing crisis here. I don't know how other normal people do it. I tap friends and family for showers and water supply. I use my aunt's address for mail. Random friends in Whitefish to bum around with.

If your frugal and ready for it I know a guy who pays 300$ a month for a shack in hungry horse. Consider going up that way northward on 206 for some potential options.

As other have alluded too it's a tough place to live. I personally thrive in harsh conditions so it fits me. Who needs running water or stable electricity anyways. I enjoy the outdoors and all the shit it tries to throw at me.

I am cold a lot. A month back we had a cold snap with a -bullshit degree windchill and I literally could not keep water in a liquid form for drinking. It takes so much fucking snow to make water. My body was fine because I have very good clothes and bedding but the infrastructure was failing me. I had a MR buddy heater running and I am like 25% certain it's gunna give me brain damage though.

Speaking of infrastructure. Any place that has it is going to be unaffordable. This is not like a suburb with actual civic planning and cities that function. More of a sprawl coming inwards from the surrounding mountains towards the center of the valley. People here are ruthlessly individualistic and you can't have big expensive civil engineers getting in the way of your plans on your little mountain top now can we.

Good news is that contrary to the sentiment on this sub I personally have found most of the people here to be pleasant and easy to get along with. I have made friends. Found myself in good company. I ski a lot and ski people seem to be more..... functional.... in general. It's a tough sport that weeds out the truely despicable in my experience.

I could go on forever. I have spent a lot of time contemplating why I am here and what this place means to me. It's been three years now full time skibum life and it's been a trip.

"Not a scam, just someone hoping you are sitting on a messy home in need of some repairs...maybe you need money now and can't be bothered to fix it up and clean out your junk so you'll sell it to them at a discount.  In exchange they offer a fast close with an all cash offer, you don't lose 6% to the realtors, and they cover the closing costs.

They'll come in with a dumpster, throw all your junk out, slap some fresh paint on the walls, make some necessary repairs, maybe replace your kitchen with low quality but NEW AND SHINY appliances, and resell it.

These are the people who run the ""We buy ugly houses"" ad campaign.  They are franchised, and one of the thigs you get from the franchise deal is local lead generation from their marketing campaigns.  So likely what happens is if you respond to this card, they forward the lead to a local franchisee who will send an agent out to make a quote.

Is it a good deal?  Doubtful.  Maybe if you just inherited a crummy house from a hoarder relative...these guys will come in and you'll have cash in 3 weeks.  If you had to clean it out and fix it up yourself, it might be a month of hard work before you could even get it listed.  Add up repair expenses, junk removal, the cost of your time, and 6% to the realtor and maybe this starts to look appealing?

You can go west towards Libby to quickly get some of the darkest skies in the country.

Or go deep towards the south end of the hungry horse reservoir.

Or go up the north fork quite a ways.

The south end of  lake McDonald actually still has a fair amount of light pollution. You can only get to the south part in winter by car. So I don't think the park is actually that great for star gazing in the winter.

"Well, if I'm being honest, Applied materials isn't really taking many hired on people. I'm getting hired on at some point soonish, I was told by my lead and supervisor.

If you don't get hired on you work 18 months then have to wait 3 months to come back and do it over and over again unless you get hired on. I started at a good time because now with how long I've been here and them wanting to hire people on who they need to work there I was one of the many they picked. Also this is very much NOT salary pay, it's hourly pay.

"1) First, the COVID ""vaccines"" are absolutely gene therapy.  Here's the FDA's definition: 

> human gene therapy is the administration of genetic material to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene product or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use.

So when mRNA (genetic material) is used to alter the biological properties of living cells (in this case to coax part of your cells to change functions and produce a part of the COVID-19 spike protein to generate an immune response, is it *BY DEFINITION* gene therapy.  

But OK, you say the ""fact checkers"" at your favorite ~~for-profit propaganda outlet~~ unbiased media outlet DEBUNKED that conspiracy theory.  Did you know that in their SEC filings, Pfizer states that the FDA and Pfizer both consider mRNA therapeutics to be ""gene therapy""?  No?  [Well here's the SEC filing paperwork](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000168285220000017/mrna-20200630.htm).  Check out page 70, or just to a Control-F search for ""gene therapy"" and it will take you right to the relevant section.  I guess Pfizer and the FDA are in on the conspiracy!  Someone better DEBUNK their SEC filings post haste!

It gets even better, though.  Did you know that at the World Health Summit just over a month ago, Stefan Oelrich, president of Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division, [proudly called mRNA vaccines ""cell and gene therapy""](https://youtu.be/OJFKBritLlc?t=5370), saying they represent a ""revolution"" in his line of business?  Did you also know that he said...

> ""ultimately the mRNA vaccines are an example for that cell and gene therapy. I always like to say: if we had surveyed two years ago in the public – ‘would you be willing to take a gene or cell therapy and inject it into your body?’ – we probably would have had a 95% refusal rate""

What was his point?  Oh, just that the pharmaceutical industry worked with global health organizations to change the definition of ""vaccine"" so they could call them vaccines legally and avoid that 95% refusal rate he was talking about. But that's just a conspiracy theory, too I guess.

Why would Stefan Oelrich, president of Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division, say that these mRNA ""vaccines"" are cell and gene therapy if the fact checkers at MSNBC have already BEBUNKED this conspiracy theory?  Who is wrong, Pfizer in their SEC filings?  Stefan Oelrich, president of Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals Division?  Or, could it possibly be that the media just lying to you?  They're pumping out propaganda for their preferred political party and you're lapping it up like a thirsty dog?  You tell me who I should believe: the companies and executives themselves, or some psychotic journalist writing a ""fact check""?

The problem you have is that what I have presented to you is science.  The science is that an injectable mRNA therapeutic is, BY DEFINITION, gene therapy.  It is legally regulated as gene therapy.  Pfizer considers it gene therapy in accordance with the FDA regulations.  And the rest of the pharmaceutical industry calls it ""cell and gene therapy"".   But since Stephen Colbert brought dancing needles out on stage and called all that information ""misinformation"", I guess I must be wrong.  I don't expect you to read anything I linked or watch the video either.  So I'll just make this clear for you.  What you are blindly trusting isn't science, it's OMG!Science!©®™!!! peddled by partisan hacks with a press badge.  In other words, it's propaganda meant to serve an agenda.  Nothing more.  Even if you think that agenda (getting as many people jabbed for COVID, for example) is correct or good, it's still lies and propaganda to get you to do something they *KNOW* you otherwise would never do (or at least 95% would not do).

2) Second, let's talk ""fully vaccinated"".  The number of people fully vaccinated against COVID is stuck in the mid to upper 30% range.  It's been there for *months*.  The number of people getting vaccinated has plateaued.  And guess what?  So has the number of people who got their first shot but never went back.  Which doesn't count as ""fully vaccinated"" by the CDC.  here's what they say:

> A person is considered fully vaccinated against COVID-19 ≥2 weeks after receipt of the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) or ≥2 weeks after receipt of the single dose of the Janssen vaccine.

It's that simple.  Under 40% of the population here is ""fully vaccinated"", and that has barely changed.  The county may crack 40% ""fully vaccinated"", but based on the trend, it won't get much higher than that.  And guess what?  The CDC is strongly considering (read: probably going to do it) changing that definition to mean you aren't ""fully vaccinated"" unless you have ALSO had a booster.  Likely this will happen when major EU nations do the same, which is in the works already.  Anyweays, teh national rate has largely plateaued as well, suggesting pretty much everyone who wants the Fauci Ouchi have gotten it.  But [far fewer are getting the booster](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/press-release/nearly-a-quarter-of-vaccinated-adults-received-a-covid-19-booster-shot-up-sharply-from-october-most-other-vaccinated-adults-expect-to-get-a-booster-though-about-1-in-5-say-they-likely-wont/).  So far, 20% of ""fully vaccinated"" Americans say they won't get a booster, and if that holds here, then if/when the CDC changes their ""fully vaccinated"" definition, then less than 1/3rd of the people here will be max vaxxed and boosted.  That's hypothetical, though.

The point is, we can argue until the cows come home about how to best interpret this data.  The *fact* is, though, that we've plateaued at under 40% ""fully vaccinated"" and have sat there for months.  My speculation (and that's all it is since I can't find city-by-city data) is that in the Flathead those people are concentrated in the elder care facilities, in Whitefish in general, and the medical industry (like Logan Health, which doesn't even require the jab FYI).  My anecdotal experience is that most people in my friends group are not vaccinated against COVID and have no plans to be, most people I work with are not vaccinated against COVID and have no plans to be, most people at my wife's workplace are not vaccinated against COVID and have no plans to be, and most people that we know report the same things.  The data suggests not only are we not alone, but being max vaxxed and boosted is the exception, not the rule here.",t2_nag6y,amusso18,0,1638807945.0,0,t1_hnh385j,hnh385j,False,Content-Plum4020,t3_r8ilgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kalispell/comments/r8ilgf/is_this_area_on_the_more_conservative_or_liberal/,"Is this area on the more conservative or liberal side?

">No one is vaccinated

Your own link shows that almost 50% of people have gotten at least one dose and almost  40% have gotten both.  But yeah, sure, HALF of the county is ""no one""...I guess that's how unimportant those people are to you.

>have gotten their gene therapy

Maybe you don't need to ""trust the science"", you need to *learn* some damn science.  Calling it gene therapy is not just misinformation, its a straight up lie (or complete ignorance). mRNA vaccines are simply not gene therapy--they don't change or interact with your DNA in any way

"> I kinda think they can't require it but they can make you wear a mask. Otherwise, employers straight up can't ask you at all if your vaccinated, for ANY vaccine. I think MT is the only state with this protection.

That's simply not true.  Your link even confirms it.  Employers can ask you (although most can't really do anything if you refuse to answer).

It also isn't just healthcare.  Daycares can ask, and schools can actually go as far as requiring the vaccine if they want to (in addition to the standard required school vaccinations, the law allows local authority to impose additional immunization requirements).

Federal employers (including the military, forest service and national parks) can require it (the governor tries to say they can't, but even their FAQ admits they have zero jurisdiction to stop it).  It is also unlikely that MT actually has jurisdiction to stop the federal contractor/subcontractor rules--if the federal government wants, it can just stop awarding contracts to MT companies and see how long it takes them to cave.

Also, no way the law would actually pass constitutional muster.  The fact that a *privately owned* business is literally not allowed to ""implement reasonable accommodation measures"" is beyond insane (and the fact that they carve out industries like healthcare is enough to tell you that even the bills authors know that language is an overreach).  It is a bunch of hypocritical crybaby ""conservatives""--if you don't want to wear a mask, get tested, or get a vaccine, then don't *choose* to work at a company that requires it.  If the owner of Bob's convenience store decides he only wants to work in close proximity to vaccinated (or tested and mask-wearing) employees, that's his fucking choice and you don't have to work there.",t2_17w0qg7p,RegulatoryCapture,0,1638649909.0,0,t1_hn8iumj,hn8iumj,False,Content-Plum4020,t3_r8ilgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kalispell/comments/r8ilgf/is_this_area_on_the_more_conservative_or_liberal/,"Is this area on the more conservative or liberal side?

Mainly conservative state. You are free to wear a mask if you want or you can choose not to unless told otherwise by your employer. Havn’t heard of anywhere requiring a vax to work… but DYOR because I could be missing something. People are friendly. Winters are long. Summers are short but very nice. Oh and most people would appreciate not voting in people who keep pushing for mask and vax mandates.

Housing is just difficult to find, and very competitive—even for a windowless room in someone’s basement.
Start searching 3-4 months in advance and see if you can get on some waitlists on places you are interested in living.

Also, having a roommate is a popular and more affordable option here, too. Consider that if you don’t mind living with a stranger.

"OP, I would seriously consider making a set in stone plan before you do anything. 

For starters, the winters here suck, and you don't want to be stuck in that situation while homeless. It's currently 22 degrees as I'm typing this. 

The cost of living has gone astronomically high. Airbnb's are fairly affordable here if you're staying for a weekend but $100/night is going to add up fast. 

Securing a job is important but more important than that is finding a place to live. If your plan is to hop over here and wait for a place to open up that you can afford you'd be better off waiting in NY. It could be a long while before that happens.

"The dates on milk at the grocery store will always look like they are about to expire, but don't worry, the milk is all plenty fresh.

Montana requires milk to have a ""sell by"" date 12 days after pasteurization, which is by far the shortest of any other state.  It leads to a ton of waste as grocery stores throw out perfectly good milk that they can't sell.

So don't get confused and think your milk is expiring--that's a ""sell by"" date not an ""expires on"" date.  You've got a solid week or more after the printed date.  Texas probably prints the date on the carton 21-24 days after pasteurization.

"As everyone else has said, you're *supposed* to be gaining weight when you're 13, and its hard to really know whether you *should* be doing anything about it until your body has stopped growing (except the obvious like...you shouldn't eat pizza every night).

That said, it is incredibly hard to lose weight by eating at restaurants.  Even ""healthy"" places typically have large portions and restaurants tend to use FAR more butter, salt, cheese, sugar, etc. behind the scenes in their preparation than you would choose to use at home (that's why it tastes so gooD!)

The best thing you can do for eating healthy on the cheap is to learn how to cook good food yourself.  Learn how to take fresh produce and make vegetable dishes that actually taste good without being slathered in butter. Figure out how to cook a chicken breast so it is tender and juicy rather than dry and stringy so you aren't tempted to slather it in a sugar-filled BBQ sauce.",t2_17w0qg7p,RegulatoryCapture,0,1632323667.0,0,t1_hdupv8o,hdupv8o,True,[deleted],t3_psyu2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kalispell/comments/psyu2k/healthy_places_to_eat_in_kalispell_that_isnt/,Healthy places to eat in kalispell that isn’t overpriced?,/r/Kalispell/comments/psyu2k/healthy_places_to_eat_in_kalispell_that_isnt/hdupv8o/,3,r/Kalispell,0,3

"I use AT&T and was planning to have to switch to Verizon, but it has actually been working well lately.

Last fall I felt like it really didn't work well--internet barely worked in Whitefish even despite showing bars--but right now it has been working great even up on Big Mountain or out on MTB trails where I'm surprised I even have service.  Of course eventually you end up with no service when you get far enough out...but that's true on any carrier.

Wife has Verizon and I'd say it feels comparable now rather than hands-down-better.  The nice thing is that when we are together we have better odds that at least one of us has service.

So I'd still guess that Verizon might be better, but I am no longer actively looking for a sweet ""new account"" promo to switch over (especially given the advantage of having 1 of each when I'm with my wife).",t2_17w0qg7p,RegulatoryCapture,0,1631725244.0,0,t1_hcyytvy,hcyytvy,True,[deleted],t3_por7xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kalispell/comments/por7xi/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Kalispell/comments/por7xi/deleted_by_user/hcyytvy/,1,r/Kalispell,0,1

I have a sort of phobia about talking on the phone (goddamn brain, sabotaging me), so it's really hard to deal with the hospital here.

One of my distant relatives died from it this spring. He was in his early 40s and good health.

About two thirds of the people I know absolutely refuse to get vaccinated. They use various mutually contradictory excuses and their Facebook pages are cesspools of disinfo. They get super pissed when I tell them to get vaccinated or wear masks, or even just to wash their masks.

At least I haven't heard them talk about ivermectin yet, but I would not be surprised at all to find out they've been eating horse paste.

I spend of lot of my reddit time on r/HermanCainAward lately. I'm preparing myself for when I inevitably get horrible news about one of my loved ones (who all barely speak to me currently because ""all you talk about is COVID COVID COVID!"").

"No, there are several that serve as much as you want.  SunRift Beer in Kalispell, for example, operates both a tasting room and a brewpub.  In the tasting room, yes, 48 oz is the limit.  In the brewpub (right next door) there is no limit.  Flathead Lake Brewing is the same.  They operate a brewpub with a full bar, and can serve more than 48 oz.

"Yeah, it can be real hard to make the numbers work unless you really need the infinite scheduling flexibility.

Like if your plan is to just drive from 4-7 every tuesday and thursday, you'd be better off just getting a part time job for those hours--you'd be able to find someone who would accommodate your schedule these days.

But say you're a contractor or something who never quite knows when they will have work...If you have a job from 8AM to 10:30 and another job from 2-4...you could flip on Uber in the middle of the day and catch some fares for a few extra bucks.  

Or I knew a nanny who would typically be done around 3 or 4PM and would flip on Uber some days after work trying to catch a few fares that eventually took her towards home (does uber still have the ability to plug in a ""I'm trying to go this way"" location and not get rides in the total opposite direction?).  I'd imagine that is less doable around here than somewhere with more Uber traffic though.

And you're limited to how much you can do it.  You can't go out and pull a 10 hour Uber shift and hope to make consistent money...you'd have to time it around peak hours to get a high per-hour income.

"That’s why everyone is hiring and nobody can find enough employees. 
Every restaurant is short handed, every grocery store, every coffee shop, every retail store, every contractor, every construction company, you name it. Everyone is hiring, nobody can get workers. Average starting pay most places is between 13-18 an hour. Lots of places doing sign on bonuses. 
It sounds great to people wanting to move here that are looking at the job market. But they don’t realize the housing market is inflated right now and there are currently more people seeking housing than there are houses. 
Last year when covid hit and companies told their employees to work remotely we got flooded with something like 20,000 people in 18 months. 
People that work from home and don’t need our jobs, so we have no workers to meet the extra demand they are putting on our resources. 
Not only that, they sold their condo in California for a million bucks, come here and get in a bidding war on houses because they have the cash to burn. 
It’s not uncommon for a bidding war to cause a house to sell for 30-40k more than asking price. 
The out of state money coming in has priced the normal person out of finding a decent home here. 
Even rent is $1500-$2000 a month for anything better than a shithole. 
My wife and I are fortunate to both have above average paying jobs, were born here, and we had our house bought and paid for before everything went crazy. 
In the last 24 months the value of our house has almost doubled with the market going crazy and some improvements we’ve made. We could easily get 750-800k for it right now, and we owe nothing on it.

"I don't like the increase in people or traffic. But I also understand that is the nature of how places like this grow and unfortunately a lot of people are paying for it. However, it's naive to think it's all outsiders to blame. After all, we elected wealthy out of states to represent our interests and fucked the natives over left and right, yet people born and raised here will defend those guys.

We also need to accept that a lot of native Montanans are also to blame. We are just as susceptible to greed as anyone else is and when people realize they can sell a property to someone out of California who thinks 400k I'd a great deal, they're not going to sell it to a local who can barely get approved for 250k.

And then you have to look at wages. Regardless of what your argument for job qualifications and needs are, minimum wage is not sustainable. Double minimum wage and you MIGHT be able to make it okay of you have a roommate or two. 

People keep voting for laws that reduce help out of principle of not wanting to help people (I don't understand this), and then in the next breath complain about being able to survive being impossible.

"So I knew there was a museum up near Eureka.  Apparently this place is called [Stonehenge Air Museum](https://stonehengeairmuseum.org/aircraft).  It's in Fortine, MT, north or Whitefish (which is north of Kalispell).  As you can see from the aircraft list, at the very bottom [there's a P-51](http://stonehengeairmuseum.org/mustang).

"Eh, roundabouts seem to be everywhere these days, so the tourists will figure them out.  I keep running into them on random gas/food exits off rural interstates.

As for traffic flow,  there's hard data out there (but see below for Foys Lake).  Properly sized roundabouts usually beat the flow of other intersections--BUT there's a weird psychological quirk where people often *feel* like it is going slower.  With a stop light, you kind of alternate between two scenarios--either you blow through the intersection at full speed, or you sit completely stopped for a minute where you can zone out, change radio station, stretch your arms, look around, whatever.  If you make the light, it feels really fast and you barely think about it.  If you miss the light, you relax for a bit (unless you are running really late!) and your brain discounts the time you spend stopped...when you ""remember"" your total time at the intersection, it seems faster.

In a roundabout, you flow through, but you do it at like 15-20mph, so you feel like you are driving slow...and you never get a mental break so you are totally focused on the fact that you had to slow down and navigate the circle.  Even if the on average your drive is 20 seconds faster than with a light, your brain just feels like it was slow.

But even if it were only the same speed, I'll happily take a learning curve for a 90% reduction in fatal collisions (and a big reduction in more minor accidents too).

Point taken on Foys Lake though (and that's certainly why it is being changed).  When one road is too busy (and fast), you need something like an overpass and off ramps to allow traffic to flow, a plain roundabout is a BAD solution there.  Out east, they try to solve this with ""rotaries"" which look kind of like giant high speed roundabouts but are actually MORE dangerous and generally shitty (like [this stupid one in New Hampshire](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.7692754,-71.7613212,3a,75y,92.72h,88.78t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbrSDLKP4apiQC0En2pKPlw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192)--notice that the yield sign is pointed at people already INSIDE the circle...if you're used to legit roundabouts, that's a recipe for disaster).

"I''ll be honest with you, it's not ""out of staters"" that bother people.  It's the out of staters who on the one hand can't stop talking about, for example, how bad things have gotten in California.  How the crime is out of control, how the schools are crap, how the home prices are outrageous, how the taxes are too damned high, etc. and then on the other hand *vote for the same deranged, psychotic Democrats* who created the mess in California in the first place and think Montana is better off for it.  

I have stated before that no one really cares all that much that you moved here from a different state.  Heck, a huge portion of Montanans came here from somewhere else.  I wasn't born in this state.  The thing that makes people angry is when the people who move here complain about how terrrible things were where they came from and then busy themselves voting for the same kinds of people and advocating the same failed policies.  That's what makes people mad.  Why would you want to change the place you moved to (that's better than where you came from) into the kind of place you left behind because it was awful?  It makes no sense.  It's as though *some* people who move here think that bad ideas aren't bad anymore because they crossed state lines.  

This issue isn't unique to Montana, but in low-population states that see a net +25,000 or so population increase and many of those people are bringing all the worst things about their previous state with them, it really gets annoying fast.",t2_nag6y,amusso18,0,1626043336.0,0,t1_h4uw2in,h4uw2in,False,drstrangegov,t3_oidz18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kalispell/comments/oidz18/why_are_you_people_so_surprised_when_you_learn/,why are you people so surprised when you learn that kalispell doesnt like californians?,/r/Kalispell/comments/oidz18/why_are_you_people_so_surprised_when_you_learn/h4uw2in/,2,r/Kalispell,0,2
