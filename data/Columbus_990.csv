"All the Dublin and Hilliard schools are good in reality. Scioto and it’s feeders often don’t appear to be as good as the other Dublin schools on paper. They have large ESL and ELL populations which presents challenges with standardized ratings systems. The southern part of the Scioto feeder area (Columbus) is a lower SES than the other parts of Dublin schools. But there are also nicer and still diverse neighborhoods going to the school as well obviously. But last I checked, US News still rates it above the “fancy” Hilliard school, Davidson.

In both districts, I think genetics, level of support system, and personal drive are the only things that can limit a kid. I know UA grads that are manbaby bums and just waiting for their parents or grandparents to die, I know a dropout making six figures, and I know multiple Darby grads (the lowest rated Hilliard HS) who are on the west coast with awesome jobs.",t2_78s4h,4d4m3,0,1648269700.0,0,t1_i25pjcv,i25pjcv,True,_The_Jerk_Store,t3_tnjgx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tnjgx2/public_schools/,Public Schools,/r/Columbus/comments/tnjgx2/public_schools/i25pjcv/,1,r/Columbus,0,1

"So this conversation has made me curious as to the what reason is that Plan B is less effective… and it turns out, [researchers aren’t entirely sure](https://endocrinenews.endocrine.org/august-2014-pregnant-pause/):

> Several theories exist as to why the levonorgestrel pill fails in women over a certain weight: the dilution of the steroids in a larger blood volume; hormones becoming sequestered in fat cells; or the drug might be metabolized differently in a larger person. Yet nothing is definitive.

Ask, I didn’t realize just how ineffective Plan B was for heavier women:

> The results of a large European study show that the popular form of EC, levonorgestrel 1.5 mg, (Plan B pill) loses its potency in women weighing about 165 pounds and does not work at all in women weighing 175 pounds or more.

> Generally, levonorgestrel prevents about 50% of pregnancies that would have occurred without intervention, but when Glasier factored in weight, the effectiveness changed drastically. Women with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher experienced decreased efficacy, and the pill stopped working entirely in obese women with a BMI of 30 or higher. In fact, obese women that took levonorgestrel were slightly more likely to become pregnant, 5.8%, than women who did not take EC at all, 5.6%.

Also, apparently the Ella pill is significantly more effective than Plan B, even among women who way less than than 155lbs:

> Ella proved to be more effective than levonorgestrel regardless of weight and definitely performed better on overweight and obese women. Ella bested Plan B by half, with about 50% fewer pregnancies than those taking levonorgestrel.",t2_ig6qd,Weave77,0,1648259923.0,0,t1_i257sjd,i257sjd,False,alexandrang98,t3_tnk4ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tnk4ld/the_garden_gives_out_plan_b_for_free_no_questions/,"The Garden gives out Plan B for free, no questions asked!

"I had a baby at Riverside and it wasn’t a bad experience. The labor and delivery nurses were incredible, but the nurses afterwards really sucked. They missed something that later became a huge issue. I will say I also didn’t advocate for myself through the process, but the nurses were not very kind or helpful and actively pushed back when I said I didn’t want narcotics, which bothered me. 

I was originally planning for St Anne’s, but I needed an induction and our OB didn’t like doing inductions there because they apparently have a high rate of failed inductions and will send patients home after a failed induction (from what I understand, I could be wrong here). When my pregnancy became complicated and I needed the induction, my OB said it was either Riverside or OSU

I have heard great things about OSU and their midwife practice, but I don’t know a whole ton.

"Hilliard will redistrict at some point. Their elementary enrollment is really lopsided, and they have an overdue levy they held back because of Covid.

Dublin is also still redistricting some of their elementary students, and I suspect it will continue in a piecemeal way.

All of that to say that if you’re buying a house based on a specific elementary-middle-high path, and your child is still in early elementary, make sure you’re also good with the surrounding schools. 

My personal experience at an elementary feeding into Hilliard Davidson was that it was more diverse than say, an elementary that feeds to Dublin Jerome, but that was an asset to us. The school never ranked very high on Niche because it pulled from middle class neighborhoods, apartment complexes, and an actual motel, but the leadership and key staff were all superb.

"So, I don't want to be rude here, but beyond Wexner's name being the proper noun for the building, his name is literally not brought up in the entire article.  The goal of the unionization effort was more born of an art exhibit and them wanting to have a fair shake at the table so they engaged the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union to guide them on their path.  They literally never bring up Wexner's name in the article for any of his Epstein indiscretions, their concerns were more covid related and requirements to report during the pandemic, which AFSCME offered to help them navigate.  

I get that the internet, in the wake of the Epstein revelations, really REALLY want to nail Wexner to the wall, but this ain't it. This is literally a bunch of colleagues managing an art museum who decided that they wanted to collectively bargain and reached out the national public sector employee union to guide them in that path.

I do not want rando dogs running up to mine unless both myself and the other owners already agreed and admitted to both our dogs getting along well enough to interact like that. That's safe- what's going on there is not safe for everyone, some sure. There's quite literally laws in public safety for this so I am going to go ahead and assume I'm not wrong here.

"The Peninsula, a sprawling mixed-use development that will expand downtown's reach, is continuing to take shape. And it's not just buildings that are rising; key neighborhood components like public art and landscaping are also on the way.

""We're starting with a clean slate at the Peninsula so we're trying to create a sense of place,"" said Amy Taylor, president of the Columbus Downtown Development Corp., the master developer behind the $500 million multi-phase project.

Local muralists Adam Hernandez, Nick Stull and Lucie Shearer and New York-based architecture and design firm Studio KCA have been selected to create three murals and one sculpture to adorn the project's parking garage.

The murals will be installed on the Starling Garage before its opening in June, and the sculpture will be fabricated and installed in August.

The CDDC and Columbus Architectural Studio presented the sculpture plans to the Downtown Commission this week. They will have to go back before the commission one more time after some of the sculpture's details are finalized.

The sculpture will feature a flock of birds, starlings, taking flight from garage's towers, supported by an aluminum arm. Each starling will be adorned with an LED light to take on the appearance of a constellation at night.

The garage will serve employees, residents and guests of the mixed-use development.

The $250 million first phase of the project, scheduled to open later this year, includes an eight-story, 232,000 square foot speculative office building developed by Columbus-based Daimler Group Inc.; an eight-story, 132,000-square-foot, 197-key independent hotel developed by Columbus-based Rockbridge; and two mixed-use buildings with 330 residential units and retail space developed by Indianapolis-based Flaherty & Collins.

All those buildings will be served by the 1,400 space Starling garage.

The project's second phase will feature about 400 new residential units and 245,000 square feet of Class A office space. Developers hope to begin construction of phase two this year, finishing up by 2025.

Taylor said the goal is to make the Peninsula a ""cool, hip"" place.

""This is a start, not an end,"" Taylor said.

Taylor said there are also plans for landscaping in the area and creating a pedestrian-friendly alley between Belle and Starling with places to sit and lights hanging above it. State Street will include gateway pieces, marking that someone has entered a new part of town.

Taylor said things like this help the Peninsula be its own place, but also draw on aspects of the central business district that is downtown and the artsy neighborhood that is Franklinton.

""The great part about the Peninsula is that it can fit into downtown and Franklinton without being either,"" Taylor said.",t2_29kbly1e,columbuskevin,0,1648237969.0,0,t1_i23uu3e,i23uu3e,True,columbuskevin,t3_tnxjal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tnxjal/public_art_coming_to_the_scioto_peninsula/,Public art coming to the Scioto Peninsula,/r/Columbus/comments/tnxjal/public_art_coming_to_the_scioto_peninsula/i23uu3e/,1,r/Columbus,0,1

"Sigh... you're cherry picking sentences that say Plan B ""MAY"" do something and aren't looking any further. You're quoting an unproven, unsubstantiated claim about what Plan B MIGHT do, but hasn't been proven. Regardless, the primary method of action for Plan B is not preventing implantation. Plan B prevents pregnancy primarily by delaying or inhibiting ovulation and inhibiting fertilization. This is actually proven and founded in studies.

In fact, there was an actual fucking lawsuit about this where they had to remove the claim that Plan B prevents implantation from labels because it's not proven or substantiated anywhere, it's an old outdated claim that was never backed by science.

LNG ECPs do not interrupt an established pregnancy or harm a developing embryo. The evidence available to date shows that LNG ECP use does not prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine lining. The primary mechanism of action is to stop or disrupt ovulation; LNG ECP use may also prevent the sperm and egg from meeting.""

"This is wrong on multiple levels.

1. Plan B does NOT prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg. It prevents the fertilization through inhibition of ovulation and thickening of the cervical mucus.
2. Even if that were how it worked, it still would not be abortion. Pregnancy does not begin until implantation. If there is no pregnancy, there is nothing to ""abort"". A fertilized egg by itself is not viable until implantation. Following your logic, any use of any contraception would be considered abortion. A condom prevents viable sperm from fertilizing an egg, so using your logic, that's abortion.

">deter implantation

Which stops a pregnancy that is in progress, i.e. abortion.

>A zygote, embryo, fetus, etc is not a child

That is the key difference causing the division in views. With this premise obviously Plan B makes sense, with the premise that this is the start of a life that needs protected then Plan B is a horror.

>Your ignorant stance is disgustingly anti-science and fascist and you are a fucking idiot.

This is uncalled for. Please apologize.

Though you should notice if parents suddenly decide they don't want their infants they do not have the right to smother them. If a person holds the premise that a fertilized egg is a life, then similar argument applies.

Yes they are, and if the issue is a block to sterilization then that is the problem to solve, not a symptom of it.

>you don’t want ppl to use plan b stop voting for assholes

You shouldn't make assumptions and tie it to political platforms; those are N-dimensional and this is 1 issue.

I don't mind Plan B use, but I dislike the glorification of it. People should be seeking lifestyles of stability, not ones where you apply band-aids after getting the known bad outcome. Similar with Narcan and ""harm reduction"" measures that actually encourage those destabilizing lifestyles.

> **Brandt-Roberts Galleries**
> 
> Brandt-Roberts Galleries presents “Elsa Muñoz: Controlled Burns,” unveiling new oil paintings from the Chicago-based artist.
> 
> As a painter, she is primarily interested in making images that contribute to the effort of re-enchantment with nature as a first step towards a deeper relationship with the more-than-human world. At the heart of this series is the desire to use the metaphor of a controlled burn to help build hope and resilience in times of uncertainty. “Controlled Burns” runed April 2 through May 1.

> 
> During the month of April, Emergent Art & Craft in the Short North will feature Florida-born and Ohio-based painter Todd Jones. Todd explores the boundaries between contemporary painting and sculpture as an experimental artist.
> 
> Todd’s work is process-driven, creating layered blocks of salvaged mistint and discarded house paint that is molded and carved into newfound forms. A visual record of history is created by exposing the repetitive layers and the lost hopes and dreams each colored layer represents. This body of work is a reflection on consumerism, memory, and identity.

"Demolition is expected to begin in a few months to prepare for the long-awaited ""transformational"" redevelopment of the eastern entrance to Whitehall.

The 50-acre site on the northeast corner of East Broad Street and Hamilton Road has sat unused for three years, following the city's acquisition of the 54 Woodcliff condominium buildings on the site, along with the former Four Seasons Golf Center next door. 

The city plans to demolish the buildings, which once housed 317 condominiums, to make way for a $250 million mixed-use development that could dramatically reshape the community.

This is the culmination of a long period of time and a long period of work,"" said City Administrator Zach Woodruff.

""It's not lost on us that this site lends itself to a truly transformational project,""  he said. ""We can't understate how important this project is, not only to Whitehall but to central Ohio.""

A wire fence now surrounds the former condominiums, some of which have been torn down after the city and other municipalities used them for public safety and fire training.

Whitehall has applied for funds through the Central Ohio Community Improvement Corp. to help offset the estimated $6 million demolition cost. The city hopes to learn in April if it will receive the money, but plans to start demolition even if it doesn't, Woodruff said. 

Once cleared, the property will be developed in phases by NR Investments of Miami, Florida. 

""We plan to go straight into vertical construction after demolition, in mid- to late-summer,"" said NR Investments Chief Operating Officer Terry Wellons. 

The company and the city entered into a development agreement in August 2020 after brainstorming a design for the site with DPZ CoDesign, a pioneer in mixed-use ""new urbanist"" development.

Whitehall has applied for funds through the Central Ohio Community Improvement Corp. to help offset the estimated $6 million demolition cost. The city hopes to learn in April if it will receive the money, but plans to start demolition even if it doesn't, Woodruff said. 

The Woodcliff condominiums at the northeast corner of East Broad Street and North Hamilton Road are expected to be demolished to make way for redevelopment this year.
Once cleared, the property will be developed in phases by NR Investments of Miami, Florida. 

""We plan to go straight into vertical construction after demolition, in mid- to late-summer,"" said NR Investments Chief Operating Officer Terry Wellons. 

The company and the city entered into a development agreement in August 2020 after brainstorming a design for the site with DPZ CoDesign, a pioneer in mixed-use ""new urbanist"" development.

The plan that emerged calls for residences, shops, restaurants and offices laid out with boulevards and multiple outdoor gathering spots.

“It’s very much urban architecture, a walkable community,” Wellons said.  “It’s a fantastic site.”

The 50-acre site will feature an outdoor amphitheater as well as green space and ponds that blend into the 80-acre Whitehall Community Park next door. 

""We didn't want the park to feel like the back yard,"" Woodruff said. ""We really strived to integrate the greenspace, with connectivity to trails and parkland. We're going to develop 50 acres, but it's really going to be 130 acres.""

The development planned for East Broad Street and Hamilton Road in Whitehall will have access to 80 acres of parkland.
The city hoped to start construction last year but continued tweaking the plan, in part in response to the pandemic. While the plan still calls for offices, for example, offices aren't likely to be a focus of the first phase. 

Instead, the first phase, which will be directly on the corner of Broad and Hamilton, will focus on housing.

""We’ll start with 250 residential units on the corner, with some space for restaurants and commercial,"" Wellons said. 

The first phase of the former Woodcliff condominium property at East Broad Street and Hamilton Road will include apartments, commercial space and parks.
""When it's built out, we want to have 1,000-plus residential units there, for sale and for rent, as well as close to 100,000 square feet of retail, and we’ve reserved some footprints for office, but how high we go depends on the market.""

The plan allows for the development to take up to 15 years to complete, but Woodruff and Wellons expect it to go much faster, given the strong demand for housing in the region.


""With the market being where it's at, barring some changes, we expect to continue through from one phase to the next,"" Wellons said.

The project, which has yet to be named, is the next major step in the redevelopment of the Broad and Hamilton area, which serves as Whitehall's east entrance.

Immediately north of the Woodcliff site, in addition to the Whitehall park and a YMCA, is the new headquarters of Heartland Bank. On the southwest corner of Hamilton and Broad, the mixed-use Lofts at Norton Crossing development opened in 2020, offering 360 apartments, a park and retail tenants.

In addition, $10 million in street improvements are planned for the Broad and Hamilton intersection that will include street widening, bike lanes, new lighting and new crosswalks. That work is planned for next year.

Whitehall officials see the site, which touches Big Walnut Creek, as one of a kind.

""How many 130-acre sites with 80 acres of dedicated greenspaces are inside (Interstate) 270?"" asked Woodruff. ""How many other sites have one of central Ohio's main waterways? How many other sites off 270 are in the shadow of the airport? How many have Broad Street adjacent to them?""",t2_ksn5jlko,Level_Special3554,0,1648227014.0,0,t1_i233a7c,i233a7c,False,McElwaine,t3_tnlvuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tnlvuw/demolition_to_start_soon_for_major_whitehall/,Demolition to start soon for major Whitehall redevelopment,/r/Columbus/comments/tnlvuw/demolition_to_start_soon_for_major_whitehall/i233a7c/,5,r/Columbus,0,5

"> The union push at the Wexner Center is unfolding at a point in time when the labor movement is experiencing a bit of an attention renaissance in the United States. Recently, Starbucks has claimed headlines with a growing grassroots union movement that has seen workers at more than 100 Starbucks stores in 19 states vote to unionize, including the Downtown Columbus shop located at 88 E. Broad St., [which filed its intent to form a union on Monday](https://www.columbusalive.com/story/entertainment/columns/2022/03/22/list-seven-good-reads-starbucks-union-drive-hits-columbus/7131261001/). And a Gallup poll conducted in August 2021 found union support [at its highest point in the U.S. since 1965](https://news.gallup.com/poll/354455/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx), with 68 percent of Americans holding favorable views of labor unions.
> 
> “With everything that’s happened during the pandemic, people are really starting to understand that a lot of times they have the upper hand in their places of work to be able to negotiate better terms of employment,” Spence said. “Also, with the union movement, a lot of people tend to think of mine workers and auto workers — these blue-collar entities. And there’s really been this shift in understanding that a union is for _everybody_. Your job doesn’t have to be physically threatening to need protection.”
> 
> Despite the renewed interest, however, union membership levels [remain at historic lows](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/u-s-labors-watershed-year-failed-to-boost-union-memberships), with the union membership rate for U.S. workers standing at 10.3 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, down from nearly one-third of American workers in the 1950s. And many businesses continue to take a jaundiced view of unions. Starbucks, for example, runs a website called [We Are One Starbucks](https://one.starbucks.com/), which labels employees “partners” and encourages them to vote ""no"" on union efforts. Workers also said the company has [engaged in union-busting tactics](https://www.eater.com/22834776/starbucks-union-vote-buffalo).
> 
> But there are sectors where unions have seen growth, including within art institutes. If successful, the Wexner Center would join a wave of [more than two dozen art institutions](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/arts/design/museums-unions-labor.html#:~:text=Workers%20at%20the%20Whitney%20Museum,collective%20bargaining%20units%20in%20the) where labor organizing efforts have taken root in the last three years, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Guggenheim and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where Burton now serves as director.
> 
> Miranda Inscho, visitor experience coordinator in ticketing at the Wex and a full-time employee of four years, said that prior to engaging in talks with her co-workers, she believed unions to be exclusive to blue-collar workers. “It’s not in the front of your mind, like, _oh yeah_, the art folks are unionizing,” Inscho said. “I think having a wave of other cultural institutions having the same ideas really made it like, oh, this is something we can do. This is something we _should_ be doing.”
> 
> The decision by Wex employees to take steps toward unionization has been cheered by [filmmakers Reichert](https://www.columbusalive.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/01/50-years-in-filmmaker-julia/2636125007/) and Bognar, who together have an extensive history with the arts institute. “Julia and I have been going to the Wexner Center as patrons, moviegoers, as members and sometimes even as guest artists basically since the Wexner Center opened,” Bognar said. “It’s really great that they’re doing it, and of course we hope that a forward-thinking institution like Ohio State will recognize this is a good thing and not mount some big campaign against it.”

> 
> Recent moves made by Wexner workers also caught the attention of David Green, who served as president of UAW Local 1112 in Lordstown at the time GM unallocated the plant, and who appeared in a number of the photos taken by Frazier that graced the walls of the Wex in “The Last Cruze.”
> 
> “Isn’t that awesome? It takes rain and sun to grow anything, the good and the bad,” Green said by phone from Indiana, where he continues to work for GM. “Obviously, for us to have a plant close, it was a horrible thing to go through, and we had [union] members get divorced, [die by] suicide, and just so many people get displaced. LaToya, in her advocacy, was able to take that emotion and put it into a picture, which is incredible in its own right. And then when I heard about the folks at the Wex wanting to form a union, I was kind of overwhelmed.”
> 
> Green said that the months in which Frazier shadowed the Lordstown workers were a blur of tense, high-stakes meetings and phone calls, and traveling to the Wex for the opening reception of “The Last Cruze” brought him back to those anxious days when the union fought tirelessly to keep auto production rolling in the town.
> 
> “For me, I was very emotional. I’m looking at these pictures, like, I know these people. That person is dead already. They’re in Missouri. They’re in Texas. Oh, look, you’re in Indiana with me,” Green said. “But it’s chronicled, and now it’s this piece of art that can live on.”
> 
> Its existence, Green said, can also lead to these pro-union ideas taking root in unexpected places at unpredictable times, which is precisely what happened at the Wex.
> 
> “LaToya Ruby Frazier’s photographs are beautiful in themselves, and really capture a lot, but in this exhibition, next to each photograph was a narrative about each person, and a story about Lordstown,” Reber said. “And during the exhibition, LaToya Ruby Frazier said, ‘When this book comes out (_The Last Cruze_), I want it to be a tool for people who want to start unions in their workplaces.’ &mldr; I’d never experienced that kind of exhibit at the Wexner Center, and I thought, if this is at the Wexner Center, leadership is going to be _totally down_ with a union. And maybe they are. I don’t know.”

> ## Amid a nationwide resurgence in the conversation around organized labor, employees at the Ohio State art institute recently announced an intent to form a union
> 
> In August 2020, the Wexner Center for the Arts hosted an exhibition by visual artist LaToya Ruby Frazier. Dubbed “The Last Cruze,” the exhibit centered on pictures taken by Frazier of the union workers at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which was officially unallocated by the company and ceased production of the Chevrolet Cruze in 2019.
> 
> During these uncertain final months, Frazier spent long stretches in Lordstown photographing members of the UAW Local 1112. These images formed the crux of [the exhibit at the Wex](https://wexarts.org/exhibitions/latoya-ruby-frazier-last-cruze) and were also compiled [for a companion book](https://renaissancesociety.org/publishing/830/the-last-cruze/), included alongside informational passages and one instructional section headlined “How to organize a union in your workplace.”
> 
> At the same time the Wex staged “The Last Cruze,” a number of its workers began to engage in early conversations about forming a union, motivated by long-standing issues further exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
> 
> “Seeing that work in our galleries, at a contemporary art museum, where a lot of contemporary art is geared toward the elites and there’s a lot of money wrapped up in it... to actually see work that represented working people in the building I was working in, I just thought it was cool,” said Matt Reber, manager of store operations and a Wex employee of 15 years. “So, we had this cool labor show, and we had these people from Lordstown in the building, actual union members in the building. &mldr; And then you’re seeing these things play out in your workplace in real time, where, oh, you’re being forced to go back to work [in a pandemic], and your concerns aren’t being addressed. You’re experiencing all of this stuff that had seemed so far away.”
> 
> “[The exhibit] made it seem like this idea — of unionizing, of collective action, of organizing — is important,” said Jo Snyder, learning and public practice programs coordinator and a Wex employee of just over two years. “It’s important enough to be art and to be in our galleries. This is something the Wexner Center _values_.”

> 
> On March 4, following months of extensive conversation and planning that started to take on a more serious tone in the fall of 2021, the employees announced their intent to form a union with AFSCME Ohio Council 8 under the banner of Wex Workers United, citing concerns over health and safety, pay, transparency and top-down decision-making, among other factors. (Employees at the Wex established contact with AFSCME in the research process, drawn in by the organization’s [Cultural Workers United](https://www.afscme.org/about/jobs-we-do/museums-and-cultural-institutions?utm_source=sem_cw&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=sem&source=sem_cw&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0PWRBhDKARIsAPKHFGiiqKBob1ng6WudsJS7aDonn0qB3g8kUiiBkfoAltWNU9T3Jb-wK0YaAsaoEALw_wcB), which represents museum workers, in addition to staff at zoos, planetariums, science centers and other cultural institutions nationwide.)
> 
> “The last two years have greatly exacerbated long-standing issues at the Wex and Ohio State, including pay equity and working culture,” the group wrote [in a letter sent to leadership](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DIp8i2d5cE6Q8P_mCUtFseUrB2_J0bhS/view) at both the Wexner Center and Ohio State. “When the center reopened to the public [following the initial COVID-19 shutdown], some of the lowest-paid among us were required to put our health on the line and return to public-facing responsibilities on-site, before vaccines were available.”
> 
> Across myriad fields, the pandemic has served as something of a wake-up call for workers, particularly so-called “essential workers” in fields such as the food service industry, [which has been beset by staffing issues](https://www.columbusalive.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/05/20/myth-nobody-wants-work/5177847001/).

> 
> “I feel like there’s something in the air where people who work are tired of being pushed around,” said filmmaker Steven Bognar, who has an extensive history with the Wex, and whose [work with Julia Reichert](https://www.columbusalive.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/01/50-years-in-filmmaker-julia/2636125007/) has consistently focused on labor issues ([“American Factory”](https://www.columbusalive.com/story/entertainment/human-interest/2020/02/18/sen-sherrod-brown-shocked-but/1671430007/); “9to5: The Story of a Movement”). “And I think it’s partly that the pandemic has made us all realize how fragile life is, how uncertain it is. Why should we spend our years being treated badly?”
> 
> “If you take anything that’s happening in any workplace and then you throw a pandemic on top of it, it just really exposes everything,” said Reber, adding that staff furloughs and pay reductions experienced by Wex employees in the wake of COVID-19 only heightened the economic gulf that exists within the institution. “Having that explained to me as a shared sacrifice by someone who might make 10 times what I make, it just really highlighted those pay inequities.”
> 
> While conversations about forming a union started to intensify around the same time that former Wexner Center director Johanna Burton [exited the institution in September 2021](https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/lifestyle/features/2021/09/03/johanna-burton-leave-wexner-center-arts/5720637001/), the members of Wex Workers United said Burton’s departure had little impact on their thinking. If anything, Snyder said, the shakeup reiterated the importance of establishing a union, which could help provide employees a sense of stability amid leadership changes. “The problem of not having a union is you’re subject to the whims of whoever your direct boss is at the time,” Snyder said.
> 
> Though grievances helped drive some of the initial conversations around the Wex union — “In any workplace, you’re going to talk to your co-workers about your concerns, or thoughts you have about how the job can improve,” Snyder said — employees said they quickly embraced organizing as a means of escaping this negative downward spiral. “I’ve worked at places where that happens, where it ends in misery, and we decided to do something about it,” Reber said. “We found we actually like the place where we work. &mldr; And we want to help the institution be what it says it is.”
> 
> In announcing its intent to unionize, Wex Workers United expressed hope that university leadership would opt to voluntarily recognize the union. Asked if the university would take this step, a spokesperson provided an emailed statement credited to Wexner Center Co-Interim Executive Directors Megan Cavanaugh and Kelly Stevelt, which said that Wex Workers United had not filed a petition for voluntary recognition, but rather had announced an intent to file a Petition for Election Representation with the State Employment Relations Board (SERB).
> 
> Moving forward, Wex Workers United, with guidance from AFSCME Ohio Council 8, will indeed file for an election with SERB, which will serve as an intermediary through the process, said AFSCME organizer Corissa Spence. “They’re going to be the ones who facilitate the election, handle the vote count, certify the results — things like that,” Spence said.
> 
> The Wex currently employs 70 full-time staffers, along with roughly 150 students, part-time staff, security officers and volunteers. The four members of Wex Workers United interviewed by _Alive_ said ongoing conversations suggest “a great majority support” for a union among staff. If the vote is successful, Wex employees would have representation with AFSCME, and the new union could then begin the process of negotiating a contract with the university for better wages, benefits and working conditions.

Talked about how box store stuff (jeldwen, pella) is garbage, Rosati has so much frame it cuts down on glass/visibility/etc. His username if my memory is right had ""buffalo"" something in it. It's probably a 6 year old thread now.

THAT SAID, one of the tops on his list for Ohio was Polaris. I found some companies that installed these. Got their mid line windows.

"Forget the curveball Ricky, give him The Heater! With baseball back in full swing it was time to test my mettle with another spicy pizza. Brenz Pizza Co's ""The Heater"" is their ""Buffalo Chicken with an attitude!"" EXTRA HOT sauce, special cheese blend, marinated chicken, bacon, sweet onions, and jalepenos.

No idea what is added to make it their ""Extra Hot sauce,"" but when Fibonnacci's has put you through the wringer multiple times, an ""extra hot"" pizza sauce definitely gets an eyebrow raise. One slice held aloft, I said a quiet prayer to the Columbus Cracker Crust Pizza gods, asking them to forgive my non-traditional pie sins. As I took the first bite, I got a distinct hit of vinegar from the buffalo and the pickled jalapeños. What followed was more of the same, with minimal heat, some vinegar bite, and a low-level spicy plateau.

It was enough to shake the sinuses loose a bit, but after nearly dying from spicy pizzas past, this one felt like a breath of fresh air. That said, we're placing Brenz Pizza Co's The Heater at #111 on our list. It's a solid intro to those looking to get into the spicy pizza game.

"No, you don't. Dog behavior is exceedingly complicated and very few people understand their dog's motivations. If your loose dog is charging at my leashed dog, your dog is neither friendly, nor ""well trained"". They aren't even doing dog communication well.

Most friendly, confident, well adjusted dogs will recognize a reactive dog and avoid eye contact, avoid any interaction. Charging  in when not invited is EXTREMELY rude, and an already reactive dog will probably react further. As well they should, your loose dog committed a gross social faux pas and needs to stop that.

And then there are the truly unbalanced dogs. I had one of those.  Otherwise friendly dogs could recognize he was not right in the head. His own mother attacked him.  Dogs will try to correct behaviors in other dogs, or in his case recognize there is something seriously wrong and just try to put my dog out of his misery.

"I think this is the perfect place for this post. In a state where reproductive rights are being narrowed, if not eliminated, on a regular basis, and politicians are legislating based not on public opinion but personal/religious belief and personal gain, I thinks it's great for people to know where options are available. There have been cases around the country of people wishing to buy ""Plan B"" and pharmacists refusing to sell it based on personal or religious ideology. It's helpful to know that someone can get this if they desire it without refusal or ""slut shaming."" Finally, I find it hypocritical that those who are always touting small government and personal freedom want to dictate what people do with their bodies when in private or in concert with their partner.

"I read through 90% of the comments and can see most everyone's side. OP I give you credit for being very civil and willing to explore options in order to prevent the least amount of harm to a pet. As a dog person I'm going to freely admit to assholery/protective mom mechanism here. If (and it's happened) someone's aggressive dog comes running at my senior dog, fully expect my fist/foot to come into contact with your dog until they retreat. My dog WILL NOT SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES of your poor choices/lack of discipline or training. To be clear, my intent is not to cause harm or mame an animal however if that's what needs to happen to save/protect me or my dogs life than so be it. Strong deterrence should be utilized first IF POSSIBLE. My dog is my child and most good parents wouldn't stand by and watch a dog bully their child or cause harm. If you got a problem with me defending my innocent child who was leashed than you can fully plan on me making contact with you too. Bring on the downvotes. It won't change this dog moms mind. 

 My concern with pepper spray is getting some into my own dogs eyes/respiratory tract therefore this is not an option I would pursue. However if it works for you that's fantastic. I if we're not comfortable making contact with a human or dog then I think I would carry something  like a collapsible tactical walking cane that is easily extended when needed. For the record, if I saw at a dog park what you have described you can bet your ass I'd defend your furbaby as well. Dogs are amazing and as humans we don't deserve them, the least we can do is protect them from harm",t2_13xlwn,Halo9proportional,0,1648205602.0,0,t1_i21t00t,i21t00t,True,timewarpmega,t3_tn42zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tn42zo/can_i_mace_dogs_at_goodale_park_advice/,Can I mace dogs at Goodale Park?

"Ever since Dublin park got bought by the Connor group it got bad quick. I got out when they tried to raise rent from 1050-1400 over the course of 2 years. The unit hadn't been updated in probably 20+ years. They started requiring you to get internet and cable through them, so that was $100. The sewer/water and amenities fees were another $150 or so. When they took over they didn't tell anyone with rent on direct deposit that they'd have to set it up again, and tried to charge something like 20% of the complex late fees because of it. The office staff are constantly being rotated between different complexes

The kicker is when I moved out they took more than 30 days to send me my deposit so I sued them for 2x the amount and we settled for 1.5x the amount out of court

My street was sort of in the back and quiet so everyone took their kids to play on the street there, but everyone was friendly. LOTS of families and kids.
