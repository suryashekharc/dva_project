"I would add Soniat Realty to the Meh List. Lived at one of their properties in mid city right on canal. They never raised the rent the whole 3 years I was there. They responded to my maintenance requests through their online portal. My water bill was covered through them, so I never paid for water (or it was baked into my rent), rent was reasonable (1,200 square feet for $1,025).

My only issue with Soniat was that the unit I moved into wasn‚Äôt even cleaned at all. Trash was left from previous tenant, they said the place would be cleaned before moving in. Depending on your property manager, they might be completely unresponsive. I never met my property manager the whole time I was a tenant. I never talked to him over the phone and he only communicated through text message. When it came time to do a final walkthrough when I moved out, he promised that he would be by to do one and check out everything with me before I left. He just ghosted me. I sent him pictures and walkthrough video I did on my phone and essentially told him how I was going to be blowing up their Facebook and google review page with it. He replied back that he went by my place and did a walkthrough and I would be getting back my whole deposit (which I did receive).

"I teach at UNO and 100% it's the administration. From elementary to higher ed, the administration is NEVER on the side of the educator. I go through a lot of this myself and I am so sorry you are feeling this way. It's not worth your mental health and the system is so broken, especially in a state like Louisiana. UNO has admitted students who otherwise would not have gone to college and I have students who can barely read and write. But the administration will take their student loan money! It's a disgusting system that people sweep under the rug. Again, so sorry you are dealing with this. Big hugs. Put your mental health first!

"If you want to roll the dice a bit, there's an absolutely amazing vintage clothing store in Cambridge (easily accessible by the MBTA Red Line subway, or by cab) its called The Garment District, and when I lived in Boston several years ago I got so much nice stuff there for pennies on the dollar. My best find was a 1960s era forest green double breasted Brooks Brothers suit for $35. Also once found a 1940s Dior gown that only needed one button replaced. It was like $150 for the gown. Regardless of where you get your dress, if you're gonna have any free time on your trip, I can't recommend it enough. (I also highly recommend the shop Ritual Arts in Boston near the corner of Commonwealth Blvd & Harvard Ave. Beautiful jewelry, awesome mineral samples, and best of all: Lovebomb, a big fluffy fluff cat who is adorably chill and I love him so much)

I feel like suicidal ideation is just a normal part of teaching in New Orleans charter schools.  I was so abused by the admin that I wanted to kill myself everyday when I got home from work.

"Yeah, I think they should outlaw homework because that‚Äôs where kids fall behind, because their parents don‚Äôt help them. They should have a period for that where they could get it done and get the help tutoring they need. A lot of times, the parents are too busy or don‚Äôt know how to do the homework themselves and it negatively affects the child. When the child gets so far behind, they get embarrassed and start rebelling and acting out and eventually just stop showing up. 

They could blame the admin all they want, but it‚Äôs the parents. What can an admin or teacher do, if the child won‚Äôt listen or their parents come to kick your butt for over stepping? 

When I was in high school, we all had the same admin and teachers, I made straight A‚Äôs, my boyfriend was truant and in and out of jail. He and the other ‚Äútroubled‚Äù kids would come at the beginning of the year and then eventually fade out because it was easier to not show up than to catch up. Nobody wants to come to a place where they are failing, especially if the parents don‚Äôt care/aren‚Äôt aware. Nowadays he‚Äôs figured out excels at a lot of things and he shows up to them without fail. 

I think if they make the playing field more even by making the kids able to pass without parents help, they‚Äôd have a better chance at succeeding, have more pride and and be more likely to finish.",t2_1ussnxot,_Controle,0,1648260145.0,0,t1_i2588dp,i2588dp,False,Particular-Summer804,t3_tnsw3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tnsw3n/orleans_parish_schools_rant/,Orleans Parish Schools Rant,/r/NewOrleans/comments/tnsw3n/orleans_parish_schools_rant/i2588dp/,3,r/NewOrleans,0,3

At camp the atmosphere was somewhere between boot camp and a technical school. A day would consist of farming/gardening, marches/workouts, classes in various subjects and you could choose skills based classes for yourself. It was also your life, you had to wash your clothes, iron linens, shave, look good, et cetera.

"I can clarify that I do blame the parents in some aspects, but even the ones truly to blame usually have years upon years of fighting for upwards mobility. It just tears you down. If I hadn‚Äôt been born with my attitude, I 100% would be fucked up high off my ass 24/7 and not able to hold a job. My non-abusive family members tell me all the time they have no idea how I was able to build a life for myself. So, yeah, I also had a shit life. That‚Äôs why I have this opinion. Some people come out of it angry for those who can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm just fucking sad and understand what I had to do and the help I had to get in order to make it work. And I barely make it work because I sacrifice a ton. These parents deserve to have kids, work, and have time for themselves TOO and that‚Äôs not happening. 

But anyway‚Ä¶we know poverty causes mental health problems, and yelling at the parents to just stop being mentally I‚Äôll does nothing. In general, the point I am really trying to make is that poor parents have less physical time with their kids because we have so little social safety nets. And we need to solve that problem first. It is nuanced, and there are grey area, but talking about shit parenting does nothing until we address the socioeconomic pitfalls of society that cause the mental health, the abuse, the lack of time at home. We can‚Äôt expect parents to take care of kids if we arent allowing them a life in which they can‚Äôt take care of myself. Again, I can‚Äôt take care of myself on my own. 

As a teacher, I ESPECIALLY think we absolutely should expect society to raise a kid. Why live in a society otherwise? Humans weren‚Äôt meant to live like this. It DOES take a village, and that‚Äôs okay.

"THIS! I kept reading comments and no one else was mentioning that these parents have also been failed by the system. It becomes a perpetual motion machine. Sure, IDEALLY, the parents would be involved and create a support structure for their children to grow and thrive‚Ä¶ but the system has been broken for so long that that is a near-impossible expectation in the current system.

Blame the systemic racism and inequities that have allowed such and educational system to persist. Blame the founders of this system.

">Attorneys are double and triple booked all the time

I'm not sure where you work that you believe this to be the case. My office would never permit an attorney to allow this to happen. First, we would notify the court of the potential conflict well in advance of the trial. Second, when both of the conflicted cases appear that they will in fact go, we would immediately notify both courts and seek a short continuance from the judge seemingly most amenable to it. If no continuance is granted, we would find alternate coverage. 

The courts are HOT to move their dockets right now due to COVID. That's understandable and a good thing, actually. The comments by the judge in which she claims that this reflected a lack of respect by the attorney may be due to his demeanor towards her in court generally rather this one occasion. I can assure you there are a lot of problematic attorneys in town. Impossible to say without having watched him practice in front of her.

"It's not the kids it's their guardian/parent(s) or rather lack their of.  

The kids could have no presents at home and their auntie, cousin or shit the street is watching them.  This could be due to a lot of factors, kids having kids, drugs, and disappearing sperm donors.  I think a good reason is a lack of jobs paying enough so that parents can work one job and be at home with their kids.

That being said, I was talking to a friend and one of the local schools has a good hospitility mentorship and I, having dealt with the lack of contractors, plumbers, etc, was wondering why local schools don't apprentice these kids at 15 on up.  

Imagine gettting out of high school with 2 years of work and hvac certifications, or three years down on the five it takes to be certified electrician/plumber.  I know some of these kids will be far gone by 15 but shit we gotta try something.

Of course my idea of expanding iuds to kids whose parents are on birth control and give the parents extra money as well as offering up  2k to any male who has 2 kids and will get a vasectomy is usually met with sideways looks.

"I disagree, and I say this as someone who was a carjacking/mugging victim about 20 years ago and regrettably got spooked and decided not to participate in the trial as a witness. 

I had every intention of cooperating fully with the case until my family got in my ear (out of concern for my safety) and told me that the perp‚Äôs families would be in the courtroom and might decide to go after me for testifying. I was very young and very spooked at the time, and the thought of their families possibly retaliating against me was enough to change my mind about being put on the stand. The prosecutor tried hard to talk me into it anyway, but I still said no. They never subpoenaed me, but honestly I wish they had because I would not have lied on the stand and I really just needed to be forced to go through with it. Ultimately I guess they didn‚Äôt bother pushing me further because they had other victim/witnesses who were cooperating (the case involved a one-night crime spree by a group of juveniles who hit multiple victims in back-to-back crimes in a matter of hours).

To this day I deeply regret not being a witness at trial because, even though there were other witnesses who did get on the stand, my testimony was unique in that they actually tried to get me to go with them to crime scene #2, which is attempted kidnapping and they likely would have (and should have) gotten a longer sentence for that.",t2_ad43y,CommonPurpose,0,1648231781.0,0,t1_i23fik3,i23fik3,False,CommonPurpose,t3_tndrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tndrpn/teen_suspect_in_fatal_carjacking_had_at_least_7/,Teen suspect in fatal carjacking had at least 7 prior arrests on 25 charges ‚Äì ‚Äúa walking crime wave‚Äù,/r/NewOrleans/comments/tndrpn/teen_suspect_in_fatal_carjacking_had_at_least_7/i23fik3/,4,r/NewOrleans,0,4

"Update 03/25:

  
Unfortunately, Mike's body was discovered in the Mississippi River this past weekend. I would like to thank those who contributed to the search efforts, those who offered kind words, and those who held him in your thoughts. He was one of a kind, truly giving, loving, and full of light. He never spoke a judgemental word and was always there for whoever needed help, in any capacity that he could provide service. His deepest concerns were to make sure everyone was okay, having a good time, and feeling good about themselves. 

  
None of us had any indication that something like this could happen. He was exuberant and positive and looking towards a better future. I feel fortunate that we had such an open friendship that we regularly shared our appreciation, respect, admiration, and love for one another. Too often these thoughts and feelings go unsaid amongst people, especially men, and yet these are the types of affirmations that we all need to hear from time to time. To show we are cared for and about, to show that we mean something, to know that we are not alone. 

  
Life is a difficult journey and the difficulties are often well hidden. Our world is fractured by aggression and animosity, judgments and condescension, assumptions and ill-placed opinions. It is much easier at the end of the day to be kind, loving, and fearless than it is to be the opposite. The weightlessness that comes with sharing your positive feelings and thoughts with others is incomparable to living the opposite. 

  
All that said, I hope that we all find a way to live more as Michael did. Sending an out-of-the-blue text to say ""Hey, thinking about you and hope you have a great day!"", calling someone you haven't talked to in a while, sharing a compliment with a stranger, helping to ease someone's struggle.

Absolutely; but you have to figure out a way to prioritize violent crimes while also holding folks accountable for these.  If I lose a bike out on my porch, that's way better than say, getting beat with a baseball bat while riding my bike and then losing it.  Like we *cannot* tolerate the latter, while the former maybe we need to be okay with when there's higher volumes of the latter.

Further, we, as a whole, *no matter what neighborhood we live in* cannot tolerate violence.  Even if it's between drug dealers in the shadiest part of NO East, we *cannot* shrug our shoulders and we need folks who care about any violence, not just violence to people in neighborhoods....

"A defense attorney was held in contempt of court and booked into the New Orleans jail Thursday after he failed to appear in court earlier in the week for a scheduled murder trial.  
  
The trial, which was slated to kick off Monday, was ultimately continued after other defense attorneys asked for more time to prepare and a witness who was in surgery was unavailable to testify.  
  
Orleans Parish District Criminal Court Judge Kimya Holmes asked Orleans Parish Sheriff‚Äôs Office deputies to arrest Stavros Panagoulopoulos after he failed to appear in court for the scheduled trial of his client, Christopher Patterson. Patterson, along with co-defendant Gerald Barnes, is charged with second-degree murder in the April 2018 shooting death of 23-year-old Alfred Johnson.  
  
Panagoulopoulos left Holmes‚Äô courtroom Monday represent another defendant in a separate murder trial in Jefferson Parish ‚Äî the trial of Leonidas Lowry, charged with second-degree murder in the 2016 slaying of Ethan Allen in Gretna. Voir dire, or jury selection, had begun in that trial and Panagoulopoulos' needed to attend, said defense Anthony Angelette, who also represents Lowry.  
  
But after learning Panagoulopoulos was in another trial, a court transcript shows that Holmes replied, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my problem,‚Äù before demanding that the trial move forward.  
  
She asked deputies to ‚Äúgo find Mr. Panagoulopoulos,‚Äù adding that, ‚Äúif he has to come here in handcuffs, I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù Holmes then suggested Panagoulopoulos‚Äô absence was a racial slight.  
  
‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm saying is this,‚Äù Holmes told the court. ‚ÄúIf I was a white man or a white female, I‚Äôm pretty sure the treatment I would be getting from the defense attorneys would be different.‚Äù  
  
Following his contempt of court hearing Thursday, Orleans Parish Sheriff‚Äôs Office records show Panagoulopoulos was booked into jail on a 24-hour hold. He was also fined $100.  
  
In a ruling filed Thursday, Holmes wrote that court staff texted Panagoulopoulos to ask him to return to court, but he declined, saying that ""he was required to attend another matter."" Court staff also texted Panagoulopoulos to inform him that an attachment had been issued for his arrest, according to the ruling.  
  
Attorney Barry Ranshi, who represented Panagoulopoulos at Thursday‚Äôs hearing, declined to comment.   
  
Holmes did not return calls and emails for comment Thursday afternoon. In her ruling, Holmes wrote that Panagoulopoulos ""exhibited insolence, unprofessionalism and a willful disregard for the order of this court.""  
  
Monday‚Äôs court transcript indicates that Holmes was concerned about advancing Barnes' and Patterson‚Äôs trial, which had been set and moved several times since their arrests nearly four years ago.  
  
‚ÄúI was elected to move this docket. I believe this man deserves his day in court,‚Äù Holmes said, referring to Barnes, and addressing her comments to Barnes‚Äô attorneys, public defenders Brian Woods and James Miller. ‚ÄúI believe the victim‚Äôs family deserves their day in court.‚Äù  
  
Woods and Miller, however, asked for a continuance after a plea deal with prosecutors fell apart shortly before the trial. Assistant District Attorney Samantha Stagias joined their request.  
  
‚ÄúWe were all under the impression we were going to go forward with that plea today,‚Äù she said.  
  
The trial was continued and reset for April after Homes learned that a witness, a police officer, was in surgery and would be unavailable to come to court to testify all week.  
  
In her ruling Thursday, Holmes wrote that Panagoulopoulos' client, Patterson, was ""prevented from having his jury trial due to the behavior of Mr. Panagoulopoulos, who unilaterally and without the court's permission chose to leave.""",t2_bb2w3,avocator,0,1648220051.0,0,t1_i22lfb7,i22lfb7,True,avocator,t3_tnno5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tnno5l/judge_kimya_holmes_puts_attorney_in_contempt_and/,Judge Kimya Holmes puts attorney in contempt and has him arrested,/r/NewOrleans/comments/tnno5l/judge_kimya_holmes_puts_attorney_in_contempt_and/i22lfb7/,29,r/NewOrleans,0,29

"> an armed robbery and gun charge in December 2020

Someone owes the citizens an explanation of this one.

Like I can see that if it's property crimes/non-violent stuff, while maybe not great to have it fall through the cracks, it's way less detrimental... but like what the fuck this kid doing out after (allegedly) using a gun in a robbery? Like the violent shit only going to escalate (and it did).  Someone gotta make it make sense and not just  duck behind the one with the family member (which, unfortunately, does make sense, but is a half-truth as to why this kid out on the streets).

As an aside, someone also needs to fill us in on motive for all this shit... where I'm beginning to lean more and more towards ""It's something to do"" more than any other motive... but I'm pretty sure Cantrell nor any other politician actually wants to acknowledge and prioritize trying to fix this busted ass system we got in place for the least financially privileged of us (except offer them some shitty tourism jobs, probably) because you can't cut a ribbon on it during your term, so why would you?",t2_gnqmj,GreenVisorOfJustice,0,1648218223.0,0,t1_i22gxdo,i22gxdo,False,CommonPurpose,t3_tndrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tndrpn/teen_suspect_in_fatal_carjacking_had_at_least_7/,Teen suspect in fatal carjacking had at least 7 prior arrests on 25 charges ‚Äì ‚Äúa walking crime wave‚Äù,/r/NewOrleans/comments/tndrpn/teen_suspect_in_fatal_carjacking_had_at_least_7/i22gxdo/,45,r/NewOrleans,0,45

"**[Peter principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)** 
 
 >The Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to ""a level of respective incompetence"": employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was explained in the 1969 book The Peter Principle (William Morrow and Company) by Peter and Raymond Hull. (Hull wrote the text, based on Peter's research.

How do you positively identify the driver? Most of these cars have temp tags. That makes identifying the owner more difficult. I‚Äôm not aware of a law that would allow you to tow a car in that situation.

"Our landlord passed away recently, owing a large water bill. SWB cut the water off soon after (unrelated to his death, just random coincidence). As we are still living here til our lease runs out, naturally would still like to have water, but SWB has been giving us the big time run around‚Ä¶ first went down there to open a ne2 account in my name with a copy of our lease that states water is included and a copy of his obituary. The lady I dealt with clearly thought I was trying to scam my way out of paying bill, as I was informed that because I lived there and used water the $6000+ (no joke!) bill was my responsibility - never mind I‚Äôve lived there for 2 years and the bulk of the bill was from before we moved in and never mind lease stipulations. Was told to come back with a copy of the death certificate.

Can‚Äôt get a copy of death certificate unless you‚Äôre a family member, but doesn‚Äôt really matter when coroner says it won‚Äôt be available for several months (death was at end of November, families still waiting‚Ä¶). Went back with contact info for the funeral home that did the cremation‚Ä¶ but this time I was informed I was wrong - the water wasn‚Äôt off and never had been and there was no big bill! Huh? This lady said she‚Äôd send someone out to see what was going on‚Ä¶this was the Friday before Mardi Gras, no big surprise nothing came of that.

Next I me with our neighborhood Liason from the Mayor‚Äôs office. She called SWB and her, yes the water is off and yes there is a big bill and if we want water someone from the family needs to go to the SWB office with two forms of ID and pay 25% of the bill. Gee, did I mention the landlord‚Äôs family lives in Indiana?

So hey, here we sit 4 month later, still with no water, aside from the multiple gallons we purchase daily at the store. Real fun when your occupation involves carpentry and dyes (the kinds that turn things different colors). Thanks a whole fucking lot for nothing, SWB. Btw, I love being treated like crap when I‚Äôve done nothing wrong!

"No one is making excuses, just stating facts. The only thing a New Orleans police officer could do in this situation, which is what we are speaking about, is turn on the lights and siren but once the person takes off that‚Äôs pretty much it. Yes they can request permission to chase, but once they give the reason for the request it will be swiftly denied. 
This policy was changed pre-consent decree if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Also, the consent decree is a joke in so many aspects and it‚Äôs a financial burden on smaller municipalities. A better result could have been achieved if the city would have put together or hired a council consisting of professionals and citizens to come up with best practices consistent with the crime and economic situation of the area and put together a list of items to complete. Then in full transparency with the citizens of the city the department should have those goals listed and checked in on every quarter to ensure those changes have taken place. But instead the monitors are paid a salary, and then paid for travel, and paid for lodging (which they seem to take advantage of mostly when the festivals are cranked up in the city) and the city has an annual bill that they apparently can‚Äôt afford‚Ä¶which takes from other resources. 
‚ÄúLaziness‚Äù. I‚Äôm more than sure that some officers are lazy as I‚Äôm sure there are lazy people in whatever profession you are in. But that is an unfair blanket statement to cast on entire agency. 
And yes it is razor thin. Because a vehicle may merely be stolen, or doing donuts, or whatever the case may be, but if they don‚Äôt have immediate knowledge that the individual driving has just committed a felony or is about to go commit another which would place the public in immediate danger the chase will not be approved. I do believe that may be demoralizing to some officers. The other side of this is that these stolen cars are almost always used to commit other crimes, such as robberies and murders, but you can‚Äôt prove that at the time so there isn‚Äôt much you can do about it.

"NEW ORLEANS ‚Äî Of the four teenaged defendants who appeared in juvenile court Wednesday after being booked in the fatal carjacking of 73-year-old Linda Frickey, who was dragged to her death Monday afternoon in front of horrified witnesses, 17-year-old John Honore stood out.

Not only because Honore's three co-defendants were 15-year-old females, but because of the number of times he has been in that court over the past several years.

WWL-TV obtained Honore's criminal history showing at least seven prior arrests on more than 25 charges dating back his first arrest for criminal damage to property at age 12.

The charges include armed robbery, possession of a firearm, auto theft, flight from an officer and ‚Äì in one case alone ‚Äì18 burglaries related to car break-ins.

Now that Honore is facing a second-degree murder charge, Rafael Goyeneche of the Metropolitan Crime Commission questions how he was allowed to pile up so many arrests in such a short period of time without more serious consequences.

‚ÄúWhat you've uncovered does not surprise me,‚Äù Goyeneche said when shown the rap sheet. ‚ÄúI would term this offender, based on the documents that you've presented to me, a walking crime wave.‚Äù

While the juvenile court system has recently moved in the direction of seeking out alternatives to incarceration, one of Honore's cases ‚Äìthe violent home invasion of a relative in May 2020 ‚Äì led to his transfer to adult court to face an aggravated burglary charge. 
In that case, according to a police report of the incident, a woman was holding her young child when five people ‚Äì allegedly including Honore ‚Äì broke into her home and beat her while she was curled up on the floor in a ‚Äúfetal position.‚Äù

Honore‚Äôs transfer to adult court was made in 2020 at the request of then District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro. Court records show the case fell apart and was dismissed by current DA Jason Williams in March 2021.

In a videotaped statement, Matt Derbes, the DA's Office chief of trials, explained why prosecutors decided to drop the case.

‚ÄúThe victim was his family member,‚Äù Derbes said in the video. ‚ÄúShe stated she did not want to cooperate in his prosecution and requested that our office drop the case since the defendant was a relative.‚Äù

But while that home invasion case was still pending, the records show that Honore was arrested at least five times while he was supposed to be on home incarceration awaiting trial in adult court. Those cases include the 18 car burglaries in October 2020, an armed robbery and gun charge in December 2020, and possession of a stolen car in October 2021.

‚ÄúWhen the police chief gets up and passionately speaks about the fact that they're arresting the same people over and over again,‚Äù Goyeneche said, ‚Äúthis is the type of case that resonates with that.‚Äù

The outcome of Honore's juvenile cases are not available because of that court's privacy laws to protect young offenders. However, if Honore is brought to adult court on the murder charge in Frickey's  death, he faces life in prison if convicted.   
Shortly after the juveniles were arrested, Williams issued this statement: ‚ÄúAny and all persons that the evidence shows participated in the murder of this elder will be prosecuted to the absolute fullest extent of the law.‚Äù 

When asked if that statement means prosecuting the juveniles as adults, the DA‚Äôs office responded Thursday that it will wait for the full police report of the fatal carjacking before making that determination.",t2_ad43y,CommonPurpose,0,1648181823.0,0,t1_i20y2zs,i20y2zs,True,CommonPurpose,t3_tndrpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/tndrpn/teen_suspect_in_fatal_carjacking_had_at_least_7/,Teen suspect in fatal carjacking had at least 7 prior arrests on 25 charges ‚Äì ‚Äúa walking crime wave‚Äù,/r/NewOrleans/comments/tndrpn/teen_suspect_in_fatal_carjacking_had_at_least_7/i20y2zs/,124,r/NewOrleans,0,124
