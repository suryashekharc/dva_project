Those early experiences both inform and bolster his commitment to continue to support small farms and the descendants of former family farms.

I love that there is a variety of local business - there was here but the last few years have cut them down pretty hard.

"I recently relocated to Bemidi.

1. Housing is way more affordable compared to renting our building right now. It also depends if you want to be in town our out a little ways. But, even 10 miles out and it will feel like your in the country. Personally,  I like it. 

2. If you want to be around people hit up down down (locally owned business) for shopping and food. I've never had an issue with crowds and parking. There is always something to do year round. Bemidji does a great job having activities for all ages. The mall is small, but i have never had a problem finding what I want. Sometimes it's quicker than shipping.

3. 3 slowest thing in Bemidji: cell service, FedEx/UPS/mail, and the drive through at McDonald's (we have 2 and there is always a line). 

4. What some references on agents, let me know. I have recently worked with a few. 

5. Internet.  Without it, I would be in trouble for remote working and when I am on-call (remember cell service is spotty in areas). Paul Bunyan is the way to go. They cover from Park Rapids to I-Falls. And Grand Rapids to 30 miles west of town I do believe. They have great customer service. And for gamers (I am not one but live with one) never a speed issue. 

6. What to know: Sanford has a monopoly on employment- but they always have jobs available.  Being union, they pay better than other locations. There are certain areas of town I wouldn't live in if you have a family.  

7. Places to eat - there are many and none have really disappointed so far - have some least favorites, but there is a nice variety.  It really depends on what you like and want.

8. This is a huge outdoor community.  It surprised me the lack of sporting stores for hiking/backpackers.

"I live in Georgia for the time being. I also graduated from BSU. Grew up in Mid-Western MN and went to Bemidji often. For pizza, I would suggest Dave's Pizza. Thats going to be my top suggestion overall. You can't get better pizza. I'm biased about Dave's, but I still think it's the best pizza I've had anywhere.  The closest you're going to get in Bemidji to fine dining is Tuto Bene which is actually pretty good. Minnesota Nice is the best breakfast place. Bemidji Brewery to get a drink. Big River Scoop for ice cream. Bar 209 for a good burger. There are a few resorts in the area to stay, but the one I would suggest is closed at the time you're going.

Cool things to see in northern MN around Bemidji in March? I guess go ice/spear fishing. Paul Bunyan and Babe downtown Bemidji. Itasca State Park/Mississippi Headwaters (Hour drive southwest from Bemidji). Maybe catch a BSU hockey game. Nature: Bemidji State Park or Lost 40 Scientific and Natural Area. There are some cross-country ski trails in the area. Turtle River Chophouse is also pretty good (15-minute drive north on 71 towards Tensrike/Blackduck).  If there's snow. Buena Vista Ski area to ski. small businesses are downtown (Yellow Umbrella for clothes) and, super random only because my mom and grandma like it for candles, is ""That's Just Dandy."" North on Hwy 9 (right turn after the airport, small farm place).

As far as internet coverage, I guess I didn't have many issues with it in 2012-17. I'm pretty sure it has decent coverage in town. As far as I know, Paul Bunyan Communications has a big holding on the area and has ""Gigazone"" for internet. (Whatever that is). It should cover modern internet requirements in my opinion. My grandparents live 15 minutes north of town and don't have any internet issues.

I've had 3 break-ins but 2 of those were long before '07. No assaults but I don't hang out in places where that sort of things happens. I don't drink nor do bars.

"The crime rate is really high, but it’s because of property crime, not violent crime. And of that property crime it’s like 95% petty theft. The violent crime is also slightly above average, but that’s because burglary is considered a violent crime, even when nobody is home. Also Bemidji proper is only 15k people, but when you include everyone who lives outside city limits, but still consider Bemidji home, and the university students, that number jumps to 30-40k.  Which more actually reflects how busy Bemidji actually is. So the base population they’re using to calculate crime rate is already stacked against Bemidji. 

In reality Bemidji isn’t really dangerous. I’ve never heard of anyone getting mugged or anything like that. I know one person who’s home got broken into, but that’s the only thing above “petty” that’s happened to someone I actually know.",t2_14tlf30f,beavertwp,0,1637010180.0,0,t1_hkrn9w5,hkrn9w5,True,alex_kast,t3_quok1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/bemidji/comments/quok1o/a_question_about_safety_and_crime_rates/,A question about safety and crime rates,/r/bemidji/comments/quok1o/a_question_about_safety_and_crime_rates/hkrn9w5/,9,r/bemidji,0,9

"The breeding survey actually bottomed out this spring, so we’re actually in one of the “down” years. However, the grouse that did manage to breed seem to have had an exceptional hatch this year, so the population right now seems pretty decent. 

The drought seemed to have been beneficial for grouse. The theory is that two of the biggest causes of mortality in grouse chicks are one;  cool wet weather causing hypothermia in newly hatched birds. And two; biting insects can cause infections, and overly stress the chicks in critical growing periods.

"I've been to a lot of amazing events in my time from Rainbow Family gatherings to Wrestlemaina to the Grateful Dead at Redrocks. I've met famous and powerful people, I've been to places few people will ever go, but what happened in that park was beyond any of this in so many ways. The aura was electrifying. While the energy may have been enormous at these other big events with their huge crowds, none of them had the type or kind of energy that Bemidji Pride #1 had. 

What I felt at this event was overwhelming joy like I've never felt.....I can only describe it as pure love. There was so much of it, the park was bathed in it, everywhere from everyone. It was the most enJOYable event I've ever attended and it was the people that made it so. 

The feeling from everyone, the glow, the smiles, the eyes, it was beyond alive. As if all evil, all negativity had been banished from the park. Nothing could ruin their day. When I was taking pictures and looking all these faces it was impossible not to notice this. As a photographer I try to remain unattached from the scene and capture it unbiased. I failed, I got demolished and sucked right in. There was no guilt, there was no shame, only pride, only radiant happy faces everywhere I pointed my camera. You've seen the pictures, you've seen the faces, everyone is glowing. It was a shot straight into my soul, it warmed my heart. 

When I read it was the first Pride, I knew it was going to be special, but I had no idea what I was about to witness. I had difficulty taking pictures at times because of the tears welling up in my eyes just seeing all these happy faces and experiencing this aura of pure joy. I have never been overwhelmed with happiness like that, horror, yes, but never happiness. It was highly emotional and quite unfamiliar. 

I averaged a picture every 25 seconds for 3 hours and I felt more energized when I was finished than when I started, like vibrating from head to toe. I should have been exhausted but I felt just the opposite, like I was walking on a cloud and couldn't even feel my feet touching the ground. The absolute courage I saw in those faces. I know what I was looking at, I was in the presence of greatness and that's an overwhelming thing to be aware of. 

I probably sound like a lunatic right now but I don't know how else to describe what I experienced in that park. It sure wasn't what I expected and it was a heck of a lot more emotional than the Paul Bunyan Trail. I have to list this as one of the most amazing experiences of my life. This affected me so powerfully I have tears streaming down my face as I write this. I can't say I ever felt that way about Wrestlemaina. I'm still wondering how an event this size could contain that much love and affect me so powerfully? 

I'm sorry a lot of you missed it, I'll be there again next year. I hope it's as magical and I hope you are there to witness this and support these wonderful people. I wholeheartedly offer my thanks to all the organizers, sponsors and especially these brave kids for blessing me with this experience. Bemidji, you can hold you head high and be proud of your accomplishment. The Gods were smiling on that Park.

"I am no expert. Lots of pictures and the internet are my saviors. Frequently I have to depend on my fans for answers. I get an education too, I like that. I used to work Fisheries, Botany is not my field. Anything I can learn about what I'm taking pictures of is a blessing.....and I find some freaky weird stuff sometime. 

Walk the trails and the woods. Take pictures and figure out what you found. That's how I do it. It's like Buddhist enlightenment, you'll remember it, always. And the walk will do you good. 

I was out back again today and found two trees covered with Chicken of the Woods. Some very small that I will document daily as they grow. It happens fairly quickly. I found several others ripe for the picking. One was 18"" in dia. 

Look on fallen oaks that have been down 5 or more years. With the 2012 derecho there are lots of oaks that old on the ground and they are prime breeding ground for Chicken of the Woods.

Make sure with your parallel park you get close enough to the curb. You’ll get dinged if you’re too far away.

"Definitely Table for 7!! They do farm to table so don't be too surprised if something is sold out as the quantity they have directly correlates to what is in season and available. I've only ever had incredible food there though!

Tara is okay. So far I haven't been impressed and won't go out of my way to even recommend it. 

Red Stu is pretty good! I thought it was a bit pricey for being just a breakfast place but the portions are big and everything tastes very fresh and well done!

Minnesota Nice Cafe has been hit or miss for me. I love the chicory coffee though! I usually still recommend going here as when they get things right it's super good! I got over hard eggs last time when I had asked for sunny side up...just odd.

People seem to forget about Raphael's cafe! I love eating there, it's so cozy and the food is exactly what you expect plus a cookie and grapes! Super cheap too! Probably my favorite lunch spot.

Wasabi if you want sushi but I'd recommend not ordering the main dishes. Way overpriced and just not good. I'll get sushi here but go across the street to New China for a meal. Haven't tried the ramen since they moved in but Slurp Ramen used to be good. New China never changes, it's awesome!

Big River Scoop has fun ice cream flavors that they change up frequently. The matcha ice cream, carrot mango sorbet, and exhausted parent ice cream are some of my favorites! I think they have pizza and pretzels but I've only ever gotten ice cream here.

Lucky Dogs for some great hot dog combinations! Really, you can't make a hot dog wrong...can you? 

Bemidji Brewing is pretty fun! Definitely amazing beer and the food is worth a try. I mostly just go here for a few drinks and to chat with people though so I can't say much about the food.

Brigit's, 209, and the Cove/Garden Grill were around in 2005 but all have changed quite a bit. I can't stand going to the Cove anymore...I just miss what it was too much to care about anything that might be considered an improvement. Feels like just any other city bar now instead of a fun 'pirates cove'. I wouldn't have mentioned it if you didn't have the possiblity of having been there before.

*Edit to add:

Tutto Bene! I rarely go here because I always think of it as the supreme fancy place in town. Best pasta I've ever had though and I love their cheesecake!

"So many good places in Bemidji! I’m current student at BSU, so I feel like I’ve got the feel on things. 
Some places that I think are a must go are Lucky dogs (a hot dog place where they make weird combinations. I recommend the Maverick and Fuzzy Dice), Turtle River Chophouse (out of my price range but a fancy steak place), Tara (the local Thai place downtown), Bar 209   (The best sports bar of sorts in bemidji. It’s a little classier than a typical sports bar but same idea. I really like their mac and cheese), and Brigid’s (a good place for a casual drink). 
Be sure to also check out Big River Scoop which is across the street from Paul and Babe. Best ice cream in town! I’d give Cantabria Coffee downtown for some quality coffee as well as Red Stu or Minnesota Nice for breakfast. 

Best of luck on finding a good place! Glad to see alumni returning to campus! There’s a new Hag-Sauer building that is really pretty and of course the state park is fun. I like the bogwalk quite a bit.

"I live in Bemidji. I actually love it. There are community activities to get involved in, we have summer concerts by the lake, bemidji state park is close, most of Lake Bemidji has trails to bike around (although you’ll be on the road for a little bit if you bike around the lake- it’s 17 miles). There are lots of groomed Nordic ski trails, and Sunday ski school if you’re new to XC skiing. There is a frisbee golf course at city park in the summer and a ski and snowshoe trail in the winter that has lit up at night. There are a few good hiking trails (spearhead Audubon society has one that’s around 5 miles long). There are two small farmers markets. One with lots of veggies Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday with only a couple stands and one on Saturday that has more stands (but less good veggies). Thrift stores are abundant. I’m not sure what the rental market looks like but since there is a college I would assume that it might take some effort to find what you want. There is no really bad part of town, but it could depend on who you get for neighbors- and crime is often drug related,  I’m not sure if it’s reported differently but there is a big variance if you live a couple miles out of town compared to in town. 

For schools, I have 1 going into highschool who has been at a charter since 6th grade. There are lots of charter school options and the public schools are decent. Most of the schools have a high percentage of low income households which means they get more funding for title 1, which is extra help for kids in reading and math. I enjoy living here but I also feel like showing up and participating in community activities helps a bunch. And politics are purple you’ll find a group for whatever section you lean towards. 

And you already mentioned winter, it’s a struggle for a lot of people who move here, but I embrace it and it has become a part of the year I always look forward to.

"Paul Bunyan Trail from the outlet bridge on Lake Bemidji south along that waterfront to the convention center. If you want to see waterfowl head over to the Erskin Settling Ponds. Lots of rare waterfowl over there right now.

The migration is over and most of the birds are nesting at the moment. 

You would be better off walking the trails in Bemidji State Park and looking for Lady's Slippers and pitcher plants. The yellow Lady's Slippers just ended.

"Rules and legal terms are on the website, MRT is minimum registration threshold, my break even on the hunt. If less than 125 register then I refund to all those who no longer want to do a hunt, all those who still want to do a treasure hunt will be able to do a treasure hunt with a modified cache - 1 ounce of silver per registration, the max registrations is set to 500 incase there are. A bunch of people who want to do the treasure hunt, if that were to actually happen (right now there are two, so highly unlikely), but if it did actually happen I would be adding more smaller caches to the hunt. Go to my website, watch our YouTube videos, you will see me, Jake, taking about the business and why I created it. I have done 8-10 small hunts already, I am yet to take a profit, although the goal is to actually make a small profit it is not and has never been the purpose of getting rich. I created this company to give people something fun and an adventure to do with their loved ones. To forget about the stress and bs in the world, and get back to what’s important, their loved ones. You can take this for what it’s worth, but it’s the truth. An ounce of silver right now is 32 bucks to buy after paying the minting premium. Of the 50 per registration, I get 44 and change, after the advertisements and the treasure chests, the gas, time, I figured one ounce per registration is pretty close to break even. That’s assuming the the MRT is not met. If it is then I will take some profits, but if 500 register, I would do something like the one big cache then  maybe 5 smaller caches thrown in throughout the hunt. Any other questions please ask.

"I believe that it is a fish trap deployed by the DNR to collect samples on the lake. Don't mess with it, or provides important research data to keep the lakes healthy.

The long net acts as a barrier that causes the fish to swim down the length of it into the big box thing on the end. They then get stuck inside because they are stupid and usually can't figure out how they got in there. 

If you go puttering around the lake you might see others at different depths and shore types. 

If you see the DNR people don't bug them while they are working, talk to them when they are pulling their boat out at the dock. Usually they are more than happy to explain what they are doing. Nice folks.

"Well, I have entered about 300,000 pictures into my database in the past 4yrs. How many would you like me to post? I'm an MIS and Network Admin, I know the dangers of Facebook. I'm happy right here. 

All of these pictures are current, taken within a week of being posted. This is an actual timeline of Nature in Bemidji as it happens. Currently Winter has just begun and there is little alive out there to take pictures of so the quantity is limited. In the Spring and early Summer it gets a bit crazy out there and posting 10pics a day is easy. I take anywhere from 100-5000 a day depending on the weather and where I'm shooting. 

Thank you for thinking about me but I'm good. Enjoy the show. If you have any request I will try to oblige.

"Setup right a Rebel is a good camera. I'm a fan of Canons. They are tough and dependable. The blind is actually a fish house I built a few years ago and has been the bird blind ever since. I guess I'll have to build another fish house.

"The detail is the cheat. When shooting from the blind I just wait for them, everything is ready. I just point the camera and hit the shutter release on the remote. The camera does the rest. At 5ft I can't run more than about 2000mm on the zoom as it won't focus any closer. I didn't make the camera and it's a modern miracle. My previous camera was a Canon SX50HS with 50x zoom. This one is a Nikon P1000 with 125x zoom (24mm-3000mm) at 16mp. It's the workhorse, not me. It can be run full auto or manual. It's an instamatic with a mega lens attached. I've fallen in love with the superzooms. No lenses to buy or change. All built in and very fast. That's how I get all these crazy pics. It is a huge camera and very heavy. They have a newer model, Nikon P950, with less zoom but smaller lighter format. The Canon SX60HS is the new Canon model. If you are serious about bird or nature pics, I highly recommend you try one out. It changed the way I did photography. 

And blinds are for sissies. Mine is heated, insulated, has electric, wireless internet, comfy chairs, a cat, two dogs and I'm thinking of installing a TV. When it gets really cold I sit out there getting toasted for 4hrs at go and I'm not suffering. It's easy, high quality bird photography. It bores me. I'd rather be in the field.

"Thank you. This is a welcome surprise. The Canon camera had a wide field of general focus. It had a hard time auto-focusing on a target. There was no manual override for the focus, it was a bit frustrating. This Nikon has an adjustable auto-focus area that can be reduced to a small dot and a manual focus ring that can be used instead of the auto-focus. The Canon got the focus wrong 60% of the time. It was quite frustrating and always seemed to happen when something rare showed up. This Nikon is much faster on the auto-focus and far more accurate, so far 80% on target handheld. On the tripod I expect it will be much higher. The Canon did focus down to 5ft at full zoom. The Nikon needs about 100ft to focus at full zoom. The Nikon does have 125x compared the the Canons 50x zoom.

Biggest problem I had in the blind is the lens is so wide it doesn't fit through the window and so long I had to back the tripod up and there is no room for me to sit behind the camera. I have to sit next to it. Also need to rig a counterweight on the tripod handle for the lens. It's a chore just holding the lens up for long periods. Nikon should have put another tripod mount at the front of the lens hood to improve balance and ease tripod use when using the telephoto. 

A Picatinny 20mm rail mount next to the hot shoe for a red dot sight would be quite helpful for rapid target acquisition at great distance. It has a few flaws that could be fixed. It does have an input jack for a mic which is very handy. 

Currently designing a permanent mount for the wall of the blind so I can lose the tripod and regain my leg room. I think we are going to have an interesting year. Now it's a matter of how cold it gets for how long.

It's a little bit of a drive, but the Lost 40 is probably the most unique hiking we have around. It'll take less time to walk it than it takes to drive there, but it's 40 acres that never got logged, so it's all old growth.

Oh, and from snooping on your other thread, definitely tune in to KAXE/KBXE when in the neighborhood.

Sad to see about the racial tensions. I do suspect that has to do a lot with our racist in cheif.

"They are towns of relatively similar size, relatively close to each other. Lots of folks go back and forth between the two towns, and the demographics feel about the same, with probably more natives and POC in Bemidji all around. I guess what I am saying is they have way more in common than different. That being said, GR is an iron range town, and Btown isn't, so there's a whole lot more mining influence and everything that entails in modern america (traditionally powerful unions, big industry money, decaying infrastructure, collapsing middle class, etc). Bemidji(where I live) on the other hand is much more of a regional center than GR, so we have a lot more people that go in and out of our town on a day to day basis. More franchises, more government agencies, even the occasional dumpsterfireinchief campaign stop. Both towns have a strong arts scene, lots of outdoors oriented people, classic small town vibes.

Bemidji seems to be growing fast, faster than grand rapids from what i can tell. As to which one is run better? I have no idea how GR goes, but Bemidji seems to be moving forward in a mostly positive way. The culture at large is a challenge right now, especially for a place that has a very large native population. Racial tension and the culture war is at the highest I have ever seen here, but I don't know how much of that is specific to us, or just the larger story of the US playing out on our small stage.

As to what makes one better than the other? meh. Grand Rapids is probably a little quieter all around, but Bemidji has more happening. Poverty is very high in both places, but self reliance is still a strong ethic up here. I would say they are more sister cities than anything, and don't feel strongly that one is better than the other.",t2_all0i,Baldweasel,0,1601928952.0,0,t1_g7tp1rr,g7tp1rr,True,ineedcoffeealready,t3_j5mg7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/bemidji/comments/j5mg7c/bemidji_vs_grand_rapids/,Bemidji vs Grand Rapids,/r/bemidji/comments/j5mg7c/bemidji_vs_grand_rapids/g7tp1rr/,3,r/bemidji,0,3

"If you can find a mature Black Walnut tree anywhere within 100 miles of your location the nuts should be acclimated to your area. Don't bother bringing some up from Iowa and planting them here. It won't work. They are quite sensitive to this. Plant them in the permanent location for the tree as they have a taproot that doesn't like to be disturbed. This far North Black Walnut grows very slowly. I've seen 40yr old trees that are 5"" in dia. The wood from these trees is very dense and sells for a premium. The nuts are an acquired taste. I love them. Many think they taste like soap. Black Walnuts are to die for in chocolate chip cookies. In case you are wondering, I have an Uncle with about 600 acres planted in Black Walnut, the oldest of which is about 50ys. It's a tree I watch for. I do know where there are a couple of very old trees near Bagley. If you know of others in the area I'd like to know. Always good to increase the gene pool. 

Warning: Do NOT plant Black Walnut anywhere near a garden or other delicate shrubbery. Black Walnuts produce an allochem called juglone. It will stunt or prevent growth of other plants. 

Warning: Do NOT plant anywhere near a structure or windows.

"My camera is an odd one. A Nikon P1000 superzoom. I was shooting a Canon SX50HS with built in 50x zoom that I picked up used. I shot just under 250,000 pictures with it before it died. I as shooting under the nick 95DegNorth. I switched nicks with the new camera so I could see the difference. I really like the superzooms and the speed at which I can shoot. I was 'getting the shot' far more often. I was back to using a very old camera for awhile until the stimulus check showed up. Now I'm back in business. 

The P1000 is a beast of a camera, huge, but the lens is amazing. 28mm-3000mm equv. which is a 125x telescope. It will reach out and touch someone. It also has very nice closeup modes. Everything is built in and it has auto or manual modes. If birding I mount a red dot hunting sight on it to make it easier to find my targets. 

No lenses, no distortion. I know how to use Photoshop but don't. I crop pictures and that's about it. What I saw is what you get. I do shoot in burst mode most of the time so 5 shots from one press of the button. This is most helpful while birding. They move quickly and you want that moment when the head is turned just right and the sun is shining in the eye. With birds it's mostly, take lots and lots of pics and find the good ones. Bugs hold still and so do plants. Much easier. Mass quantity is my secret. I'm out walking the Paul Bunyan Trail everyday with the dogs hauling a huge camera and taking pictures of everything. If you see us, stop and say hi. I'll make you famous. 

Things are slowing down in the flower and bug department. I'll see what shows up at the bird feeders this winter. I was hoping this would ease a few minds in these trying times. I was really hoping you all would get out and go exploring and see things. It's as truly amazing out there as I have shown you. Thank you for your feedback.

Then it gets  spooky in Red lake. You see 0. For about 30-40 miles.

"Thank you for all the info! I'd preferably like to get a house but I don't think that'd be very possible as I'd have about no money down for the mortgage. I like the idea of having a house over an apartment, and also less moving (because I'd want a house some day). That and like, I rather put money towards a house than trying to save for a house while also paying rent somewhere. But yeah, like I said, I don't know how doable that actually is without having a down payment. And wow okay I didn't realize energy bills could fluctuate so much! I figured I'd be on the higher end to begin with because I've been used to having AC run basically nonstop during summers.   


I'll definitely try looking into apartments though! So far I was just looking to see what the housing market was like on Zillow and it seemed pretty reasonable (at least, for what I'm looking for) which is another reason it seems like a pretty good spot for me. I had no clue Minnesota had a rebate system, that's definitely something I'll check out thank you!",t2_bcqn5,wolfpackalpha,0,1591933740.0,0,t1_ftrq49b,ftrq49b,False,wolfpackalpha,t3_h79uc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bemidji/comments/h79uc2/looking_into_possibly_moving_to_bemidji_trying_to/,"Looking into possibly moving to Bemidji, trying to put together a cost of living sheet",/r/bemidji/comments/h79uc2/looking_into_possibly_moving_to_bemidji_trying_to/ftrq49b/,1,r/bemidji,0,1
"Are you looking at renting an apartment or a house? You might have to pay for a garage. Depending on where you live, you might have to pay someone to plow (maybe $25 a plow). Electric and gas can vary depending on what you are using for heat and can fluctuate due to the winters here and summer too depending on what you consider AC weather. I lived in town and paid just for electric with free heat and never had an electric bill over $75 BUT I also know people who had electric bills over $200 because their heat was electric so keep that in mind. I never paid for water so I have no idea on that. Never paid for garbage either so I don't know but you can take your garbage to the dump here so theoretically you can pay $0 up front.

Internet would likely be Midco, Paul Bunyan Communication or Centurylink. Food can be a bit more expensive depending on your taste and needs plus being further north can sometimes limit what fresh fruits and vegetables are available.  I would include eating out because once winter hits you are sort of limited on options to get out of the house so dining out or heading to the bar are ways to beat back cabin fever. 

For housing, I would look at craigslist and simply google Bemidji apartments to see the options. Since this is a college town and there is a lack of affordable housing, rentals can be fairly expensive for what you get.  I would check out the requirements for Minnesota's renter's rebate. You can actually get a rebate for being a renter here but you need to make under a certain amount. I'm not too familiar with it but it is something to consider. 

Good luck and I hope I helped a tiny bit.",t2_116cot,Sunghana,0,1591932428.0,0,t1_ftro4h1,ftro4h1,True,wolfpackalpha,t3_h79uc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bemidji/comments/h79uc2/looking_into_possibly_moving_to_bemidji_trying_to/,"Looking into possibly moving to Bemidji, trying to put together a cost of living sheet",/r/bemidji/comments/h79uc2/looking_into_possibly_moving_to_bemidji_trying_to/ftro4h1/,2,r/bemidji,0,2

"Birds...lots of birds....Hitchcock was right. It okay. BSU has made great strides into the 21st Century. It needed a few kicks in the ass but it got done. I work with several people there when my skills are needed. I was a bit of a problem child when I attended. Now, smooth sailing. The sailing is actually very good too. I often moor my boat on Bemidji. The fishing is excellent. If you like water and woods, this is Heaven. Outdoor paradise. Lots of trails, most paved. The Paul Bunyan Trail runs for hundreds of miles with other trials intersecting. If you like bike riding, you'll really like this. I walk 3-5mi of the trail daily taking all these pictures. 

The town is a bit conservative but even that has changed considerably in the past 30yrs, thank gawd. Some of us are working hard at that. It's still a farming and logging community for the most part. Lots of Churches. Lots of old people. Some bars are a bit rough. There are several very happening college bars. Lots of good restaurants. Well, there were till covid. Not sure what will remain after we are allowed to breathe. 

Not sure about the dating scene. My better half would not be pleased. I hear the 209 Bar is a good pickup joint. All the college bars are for the younger set. I never liked drinking so I don't do bars.

The public library is very nice. It has access to inter-library loan for books. The college library is even nicer. We have ultra-fast internet here with Paul Bunyan Net. Everything is fiber optic even out into the boonies. 1gb speeds. 

Homes and land are very affordable. I purchased my lake home 20yrs ago and it has tripled in value. I've done a bit of work. If you can, find lake property. The ROI is amazing. They aren't making anymore and it's nice to be able to just walk out the door, hop in the boat and go fishing. 

Enjoying living here depends on your personality type. Are you a self starter, have hobbies, like the outdoors, this is a wonderful place. If you need to be entertained, shows, bars every night, crowds, parties, maybe not so much. Personally, I'm a country bumpkin. I hate cities with a passion. Tried it, didn't like it. Too much noise. I love it here. It really is a nice place to settle down. I was here in the 60's and have been all over the Country. I still love the land of sky blue waters. This is home.

Note for anyone interested in photography. This picture was taken during what we call 'Golden Hour'. The hour after sunrise and the hour before sunset. The light travels through more atmosphere which cuts out more of the blue light making everything appear more reddish or golden. It also lengthens the shadows and adds contrast to the photo.

"Expect birds, lots of birds. Welcome to lumberjack land. Well, it's absolutely beautiful here. Lakes and forests. If you like the outdoors you just found Heaven. If not, good luck with the mosquitoes. There aren't any in the Winter and that's 9mos out of the year so they are not so bad. 

The fishing and sailing are fantastic. We have well over 10,000 lakes and some of the lakes are so big you can't see across them. We have paved trails cross country to other towns, hundreds of miles of them. Biking is amazing as is hiking. Lots of parks and recreation areas. This is an outdoor paradise. 

The people are friendly, it's a nice small town atmosphere in a big town. It's a bit conservative but some of us are changing that. 

If you are buying a home, try to find a lake home if you can afford it. The ROI is amazing. Mine has tripled in value in 20yrs. 

How exactly do you want to get involved with the community? I do volunteer work for our Univ and the sailing club. I have very rare and specialized skill sets that I offer for free. Find your niche is the best advice I can give.

I'm the Bemidji Birder, you may have noticed all the pictures. I'm a bit of an odd duck and an innovator in this town. A bit of a wild child. If you are into birds PM me when you get to town.

"Interesting!  Well, welcome to the area!

Life is going to be a much different pace here than New York.  Expect less amenities.

You mention you are from a ""medium size city"", and I guess I'm not sure what that means.  Bemidji is the biggest city in a 100 mile radius, but that still is only a population of 15,400 people.  Families often head to Fargo or the Twin Cities to go school clothes shopping, for example.

I'm a little too old to really speak to the young person night life, but there are a number of bars downtown and in the surrounding area.  Some have a more adult atmosphere, some are college kid hangouts, and some are full of rednecks.  I don't think there are any ""night club"" type places operating anymore.

You would benefit yourself if you learn to love the outdoors and nature.  Hiking, biking, skiing, boating, fishing, hunting, etc are a big part of life here.  There are 2 state parks in the immediate area, along with the Chippewa National Forest.  Duluth and the whole ""north shore"" area is a great weekend getaway spot.

The major sporting events in the area are Lumberjack (high school) football and Beaver (college) hockey.  We have a good number of golf courses in the area.

The restaurant scene is improving every year, but will not hold a candle to what you are likely used to in the New York/New York City area.

There is an active Catholic church here, but I am not a part of it.

Community involvement is definitely possible.  There are a number of charities and city business/community organizations that you could become a member of, depending on your job and your personality.",t2_eoary,sj79,0,1590164815.0,0,t1_frgmyj6,frgmyj6,False,[deleted],t3_gocf1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/bemidji/comments/gocf1a/moving_here_soon/,Moving here soon,/r/bemidji/comments/gocf1a/moving_here_soon/frgmyj6/,2,r/bemidji,0,2

"Thank you. I've been shooting pictures since I was 5. I bought a Baby Brownie Bee camera for a dime at a yard sale. I was hooked. I was developing my own B&W by the time I was 8 and learning cropping burning and dodging. Old school. It has lost a bit of the art. It was expensive to take pictures back then so you made sure you had the shot...or at least tried. Now it's free. I use rechargeable batteries and have half a dozen of them or in the blind I have a battery replacer. It's all digital, downloaded for free. I shoot to beat hell. I've taken over 250,000 pictures in the past 4yrs. I did NOT take 250,000 good pictures. You have seen some of the best of those 250,000. It normally takes 100 pictures to get 1 good enough to publish. Because birds don't hang around I try to up that to 30:1 but even with my experience and weird equipment that is hard to maintain. Some are not up to my expectations. This new camera has been learning experience.

"The loss of the Orbit Inn and the Edge Water Hotel were both defining moments in Bemidji's history. They were local meeting spots for the towns elite. There were many heated and emotional meetings in those buildings. Some changed the course of this Town.

Colorful characters you need to know about would have to include Old man Trotman. He was a German Jew that amassed a fortune and owned a good chunk of downtown Bemidji. He was a miser's miser. There are stories that a fortune still lies hidden somewhere in one of the buildings he once owned. And there is the Steam Tunnel Ghost at BSU but that's just a rumor. I've only seen him in the elevator at the Student Union. I was pretty lit so I'm not sure if it was really a ghost or not.

Favorite place to eat. My boat. Because that means I'm out sailing and it doesn't get much better than that. 

Favorite local spot on land, Diamond Point Park. Offshore, ??? yes. 

Favorite nature spots. I'm the Bemidji Birder, anywhere the birds are, I'm game. I cover a lot of ground, pretty much all of it. I hang out at a lot of weird places you would never imagine stopping. Places like the Erskine Settling Ponds. Yea, that sounds like a hot place to take a date. It is full of birds. Ever been to the East end of Res Hwy 27 between Upper and Lower Red Lakes? I have. Make sure you have 4-wheel drive. Bring water and good shoes in case you have to walk out. How about the North shore of 3rd River bay on Lake Winnibigosh? You'll need a boat but there are pelican rookeries along the shore in the Spring time. I spend an hour a day walking the Paul Bunyan Trail every day. I just saw a quill pig. I wanted to pet him but he wasn't too keen on the idea. 

My favorite thing about Bemidji? The people. They are pretty good for a small rural community. We have our rotten apples but everyone does. For the most part, this town cares.",t2_6dladnb4,185degWest,0,1588628406.0,0,t1_fphv70o,fphv70o,True,nananananana_FARTMAN,t3_fv6yc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bemidji/comments/fv6yc0/hey_rbemidji_show_me_who_you_are/,"Hey r/Bemidji, show me who you are.",/r/bemidji/comments/fv6yc0/hey_rbemidji_show_me_who_you_are/fphv70o/,2,r/bemidji,0,2

"I know this is the Bemidji sub, but I grew up in Grand Rapids, so that's where my point of reference for this type of thing is.

At one point Pokegama Lake had a lake monster named Pokey.  It got spotted a number of times in the early 00's in the vicinity of the 169 Bridge over the Wendigo Arm.  The bar there, it was called Bridgeside, but it's a Zorbaz now, has a deck that overlooks the lake, so people would see it from there pretty regularly.  The first time I remember hearing about it was that there was an occurance where some people at the bar though that there was a capsized canoe out on the lake, so they rushed out in their boats to help only to find that it had gone by the time they got there.

Rumors about the true origin of Pokey were all over the place, ranging from it just being the drunk people at the bar seeing things/making up stories, to it being a big lake sturgeon or musky, or even something non-local that had just made it way up the river somehow. I even remember there being rumors that a certain eccentric, relatively wealthy gentleman who lived (maybe still lives, so I won't mention their name) on the lake had a small submarine that he would joyride around in and that's what people were seeing.

I remember there being a few articles in the paper about it, but [this](https://www.grandrapidsmn.com/opinion/pokegama-lake-is-rich-in-legend-lore/article_d91dcbee-12a8-577f-9f09-954dc26595a5.html) is the only one I could find in just a few minutes of Googling.

Tioga Pit is another hot bed of urban legends.  It's an old pit mine that's now flooded, so it's exceptionally deep for its size (over 200 feet).  Anyway, there are all kinds of rumors for stuff that's at the bottom of the pit, ranging from just old mining equipment, to like entire buildings, so even supposedly an old train.  It's also supposedly the dumping ground of choice for any and all evidence of elicit activities.  Murder your spouse?  Dump the weapon into Tioga Pit.  Kid goes missing?  They're probably at the bottom of Tioga Pit.  The most notable item supposedly at the bottom of Tioga Pit were Dorothy's Ruby Slippers.  Judy Garland, the actress who played Dorothy in the 1939 Wizard of Oz film, is actually from Grand Rapids, so the house she was born in is still there and is now a museum featuring a bunch of Wizard of Oz memorabilia.  One of the items they had was one of the pairs of ruby slippers that appeared in the movie (she used 4 pairs over the course of the filming, but this pair was the one they used in the close-up shots).  They were stolen from the museum in 2005, and were missing for years.  They were insured for a million dollars, so rumor was that the foundation that operates the museum actually stole them themselves as an insurance scam and then sunk them into Tioga Pit in some sort of water-tight container to be reclaimed later.  So supposedly, somewhere at the bottom of Tioga Pit was this container that had a pair of Ruby Slippers in it worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $3,000,000 just waiting to be claimed by someone.

The legend of the slippers came to a close late last year, though.  They were recovered and authenticated when someone tried to sell them back to the museum.  The consensus seems to be that it was some sort of mob operation.

"Other people seemed to have answered all of your questions BUT as I was skimming, I didn't see anyone mention the tunnel system. Bemidji is COLD. SUPER COLD. AND LONG. My birthday is in early May, and there have been years where the lake is still frozen over on my b-day. Buy layers: a good fall jacket, a winter jacket, a pair of long underwear or other insulating layers, mittens and hats, and good quality snow boots. If you can afford it, get good quality polyester or wool insulating layers or a wool sweater. 
That being said, the tunnel system at BSU will be your best friend. Depending on the dorm you're in (I'm guessing Oak hall or Tamarack) you'll have to go outside a bit, but most of the walk can be underground. Get used to the tunnel when you first move in.

"Sorry, just joined Reddit not too long ago. I’m originally from Illinois and found BSU on a site for cheapest out of state colleges. I absolutely love it. It’s great for views, camping, kayaking, fishing, hiking, and literally anything outdoors. People are super friendly on campus (they’ve got this thing called Minnesota Nice, and it’s true for the most part), you’ll have to learn some of the lingo (hotdish, pop, duck duck grey duck) but I’ve loved BSU the past three years I’ve been here (going to be a senior)

As for how liberal, Bemidji the city is majority red, however, BSU school/campus is majority blue. You’ll obviously run into people who are more conservative, but you’ll have no issue finding your friend group and where you fit in. 

Winters are cold (-60 degrees F this past school year), however, Bemidji luckily has fantastic heated tunnels so you don’t really have to go outside if it’s horrible out. If you are living in Oak Hall or Tamarack, you will have to make a little 100 yard dash in the cold, but we’ve all survived that thus far.

All in all, Bemidji is truly one of a kind. Looking back I would never have picked another college to attend. It’s cheap (especially if you become an RA), small enough so you see your friends on the way to class, but not too small to where you know every single person, and has a lot of great options for majors.

2) Definitely.  A good place to hang out and meet like-minded people would be somewhere like Bemidji Brewing, and I'm sure that's not the only place in town.

">What are some fun activities to do here? I like hiking, playing my ukulele, exploring, photography, kayaking, anything that adds adventure to my life :)

In the warm months; fishing, canoeing, hiking, campfires, golf, and parties.  Bemidji is in the heart of Minnesota summer vacation country, surrounded by beautiful lakes and forest.  Lots of hiking trails in the area.  If you or your friends have a car, I'd recommend driving Winnie Dam road in late September/October when the leaves start to change.  Really pretty colors.

In the winter months; hockey, curling, ice fishing, sledding, house parties, casinos, and drinking.

>How progressive are the people there? My personality and the way I express myself is definitely not conservative at all. I’d describe my personality and clothes as hippieish. Would I be able to connect with like minded people?

In general the area is about 50/50 liberal/conservative and usually votes blue.  The city of Bemidji is far more liberal than rest of Beltrami county.  Conservation and environmentalism is important to both the conservatives an liberals in the area.  Plenty of hippies and hipsters at the university, but also a lot of rednecks. Most people in Northern Minnesota are friendly and pretty laid back compared to the east-coast or the rest of the Midwest, or even the rest of the state.  You shouldn't have any problem finding friends. 

>How cold does it get up there? I’m from Florida but I love the snow and cold weather never bothered me. But I am curious.

Not going to sugar coat, Winter is fucking brutal.  Multiple days below 0F is not uncommon.  Buy a real nice heavy winter coat (carhart, columbia, or similar), winter gloves and boots, and keep your ears covered.  If you go out partying in the winter, never go alone and if you drop someone off, wait until they get indoors.  Duluth is at the same latitude as Bemdji and this girl lost her digits there a few years back because her friends dropped her off and she couldn't get in the house. https://www.insideedition.com/woman-who-lost-her-fingers-and-toes-frostbite-issues-dire-warning-college-students-48413

That said, there is plenty to do in the winter.  Bemidji plays NCAA Division 1 hockey and they have a very nice area to watch games in.  Ice fishing is popular, and you might be interested in snow shoeing or cross country skiing.  There is also a downhill ski park.

"Hello from a BSU Alum! I loved my time at BSU and I am sure you will too. I'll do my best to answer your questions:
1) You are set for outdoor recreation. Lake Bemidji State Park is a 10 minute drive from campus. North Country trail is fantastic and about 30 minutes south of town. Chippewa National forest is nearby too. You can rent kayaks or canoes from the school and go paddle Lake Bemidji or load them up and paddle the river or some small lake or whatever and it's pretty affordable. The local music scene is decent too but you're probably a little young for the bars yet. Might be able to catch a daytime show at Bridgits every once in a while.

2) You won't have a problem finding people who believe *anything* in Bemidji. It was my experience that i met people on all ends of the political spectrum in Bemidji, which I attribute to the it being both a college town *and* a small town. I met like-minded people, and also people who really made me think twice about some of my beliefs. Compared to Minneapolis (very progressive) where I live now, I think there actually might have been a little more diversity of thought in Bemidji. You will of course meet bigots but they're easy to write off.

"I moved to Bemidji last year, so I just went though this relatively recently.  First things first, rental prices are probably going to be crazy low compared to whatever you're used to.  Bemidji is a very low-income town, which keeps housing prices low.  Most of the house rentals in town are going to be in very old houses, and often times they'll be houses that are split into duplexes, which often times isn't mentioned in listings (looking at you Vision Properties Management).  

The eastern shore of Lake Bemidji is the ""rich"" part of town so, if you have kids, the Elementary School over there (Lincoln) is generally considered the best one.  South side of town near the arena is much more affordable and also goes to that school, I think.

Parking sucks downtown, so if you end up moving there, you'll need to get passes for any vehicles you have. Different lots cost different amounts. The cheapest is like $95 a year, iirc.  I was able to find a great two bedroom apartment downtown for about $600 a month. 

The houses on the north side of town are mostly older and tend to get rented out to college kids.  If you're not above having roommates, you can probably find a room in one of them for $400 or less a month. A lot of these places will just bundle utilities into the rent, too which is nice.

"There are apartment complexes that are geared towards renting to people who qualify for housing assistance. People don't live there out of choice, and most would move in a heart beat if they had other options. In my opinion those places look deceptively decent just driving by. There are also landlords that primarily rent to college students. When you narrow down your search to some likely options, you might want to ask here about a specific neighborhood.

We will meet from 7:45 to 8:00 a.m. at the Jacob V. Brower Visitor Center in Itasca State Park to organize the count and assign count areas. We will then be out for all the day light, or what there is of it. We will meet back there for lunch at noon (bring your own sack lunch and drink as most everything is closed up for the winter) and again later in the day, from about 3:30 on depending on sunlight and cloudiness, for compilation of our sightings. Participants should bring skis or snowshoes for the afternoon count period as that is when the count is otherwise quite slow and when it is a good time to check remote areas of the park or surrounding countryside.

**Bring: Binoculars, Bird ID book, Clipboard, Pen/Pencil, Warm clothes and boots, Camera, Water/Snacks.**

If you don't have a car we might be able to pair you up with someone that does or give you a route to walk. No preregistration necessary, JUST SHOW UP. We need all the boots on the ground we can get. We meet at noon so if you only want to participate half a day that is fine.

They're not *completely* useless. Most of them are. Still, don't bully somebody for trying to help.

Also, remember that these spambots will continue until yours stops. Do the right thing, for the community. Yes I'm holding Reddit for hostage here.

Oh, and while i doo agree with you precious feedback loop -creating comment, andi do think some of the useless advide should be removed and should just show the correction, I still don't support flaming somebody over trying to help, shittily or not.
