"AMC (I wrote a comment with links [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tnb85n/any_hobby_groupsactivities_coming_back_now_that/i22g7w8/)) is the best IMO if you like hiking and meeting folks for climbing/drinks/random events. It's a 20's and 30's crowd too so if that's your age range you'll fit right in. They do organize some events not geared specifically towards young folks too, and they don't discriminate so don't worry if you're outside that age range lol.

[NEMBA](https://nemba.org/) is another great group if you're into mountain biking. It's definitely geared towards 30's/40's aged dudes but you'll find young folks and ladies joining in too. [The Greater Boston \(GB\) Chapter](https://www.nemba.org/chapters/gbnemba) organizes group rides all summer long at places like the Fells, the Western Greenway, etc. You do need an MTB so it's a bit of a ""are you already into expensive hobbies and riding your bike down mountains and jumping over rocks and trees"" kind of thing. I'm really interested in finding a gravel/road riding group too - NEMBA is the _New England Mountain Biking Association_ so they're totally focused on at least forest roads, single track and crazy techy stuff vs more mellow road/gravel riding.

Also, /r/BostonSocialClub is a good sub to subscribe to and follow for random events and meetups. You could post there too if you're willing to organize stuff. I've posted a few times about climbing at BKB and made some friends that way. 🙃",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648218276.0,0,t1_i22h1zt,i22h1zt,True,boston-yeti,t3_tnb85n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tnb85n/any_hobby_groupsactivities_coming_back_now_that/,Any hobby groups/activities coming back now that COVID numbers are getting better?,/r/Somerville/comments/tnb85n/any_hobby_groupsactivities_coming_back_now_that/i22h1zt/,2,r/Somerville,0,2
"Here's their website: https://ym.amcboston.org/

You can search AMC's website for their activities too: https://activities.outdoors.org/search/?aud=15&grp=2

I also joined their _SOS_ (**Spontaneous Outings and Socials**) Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/amc-sos

The SOS link is the best IMO - you'll get emails whenever someone organizes a trip. For example they're going to Blue Hills tomorrow at 9am - you can find that email, click on it, join and meet a bunch of cool folks. I've done their Lynn Woods hike last year and it was pretty fun, lots of new people. And when I went to another event on the Esplanade I met some of the same folks there so it was an easy way intro (""HEY didn't I hike with you the other weekend?).

Most folks who join are joining with the hope/intention of making hiking friends too, so it's a great group for meeting new folks. Can be super helpful for carpooling too for the folks without a car.

Yes definitely! Adults should avoid riding bikes/scooters on sidewalks wherever possible so definitely take the bike lane where there is one.

"You'll definitely get a pre-k or k slot, you just might not get it at your local school. (Theoretically a spot isn't guaranteed but they're quite proud of the fact that they've never had to turn someone away yet.) Something like 80% of the pre-k classrooms are at Capuano school, with generally only 1-2 classrooms at each of the other schools. Depending on what side of town you live on, this can be somewhat annoying or kind of awesome. Capuano is a GREAT school, but the dropoff commute can be rough if you're over in west Somerville.

In terms of rec stuff, there is more than I can really wrap my head around, but my kids love the swim classes at Kennedy and the soccer program. The competition for the sports slots is high enough that it's wise to sign up the day signups open.

Look into ECIP and afterschool lotteries early as well if you want those.

No one is refuting the basic concept of supply and demand. The issue is that the ""lets focus on building market rate houses"" idea ignores the reality of the market—a point I've already labored over. The capitalist free market isn't altruistic. It is a machination designed to extract value.

To be clear I'm not saying not to build or not to build taller (within reason) buildings. I'm saying that a lot of that needs to be affordable—which may make it less appealing to developers, but makes the city's housing more equitable. 

At the end of the day we all have our ideas on how to solve housing problems. I'm confident I don't have all the answers.

">Converse, you'd likely also be unable to provide an example of a place that had high density, high demand, and was able to maintain affordable housing by dropping regulation and letting the powers of the market work their magic.

Kowloon walled city. Extremely high density but literally no regulation besides those imposed by the reality of not getting hit by planes head to the nearby airport. Prices were far, far below anywhere even remotely as dense. 

Obviously I don't think everywhere should follow that as a model, but strictly in terms of pricing to zoning limits, it follows the theory. Conversely, park City, UT is pretty sparsely populated yet incredibly expensive due to zoning limitations.

"You said at one point something was basic economics. That's what this is. High demand means prices go up. As local economies continue to converge on large regional cities demand will only increase around those places. Absent some external force (ex. specialized local economy collapses) the market is essentially rigged to only drive prices up.

We are clearly talking theory here, so I find the fallback to demanding an example a bit disappointing. I obviously can't give you an example of what you've stipulated and if I could you'd likely still be unconvinced. 

Converse, you'd likely also be unable to provide an example of a place that had high density, high demand, and was able to maintain affordable housing by dropping regulation and letting the powers of the market work their magic.

"Hi! I currently have a kiddo who is a Community Peer in the ECIP program at Capuano in East Somerville, and I’m decently well versed in the offerings in Somerville.  I’m happy to answer whatever questions you have if I can.

When is your kiddo’s birthday? A lot of the lottery registration is happening now for pre-K programs.  

SMILE is the program for those who will turn 4 by Aug 31.  This is the program most folks do.  The school day runs from 8:45-1:45 with limited after school program spots available.  There are limited seats (usually 1 class of 18 kids) at many of the neighborhood schools, anyone who doesn’t get a spot there via the lottery will get placed at Capuano, which is the Early Childhood Center— the school that only has pre-K and K.  While spots aren’t technically guaranteed, as far as I know, there’s never not been enough spots for all the kids who need them.

ECIP is the Early Childhood Integrated Program.  This is a 2 year looped program where half the kids are special needs and half are “typically developing peers.”  Peers are eligible for a lottery as long as they will be 3 by March 15, 2022.  So, if your kiddo is on the older end of the academic year, this program allows families to potentially access 2 years of preschool through the city.  Typically, spots in ECIP fill and there’s a waiting list, though last fall’s enrollment was down drastically, so everyone who applied to the program got a spot, and there are still spots available! I’m not sure what will happen next year though.  ECIP is only at Capuano; there are no ECIP classes in neighborhood schools.",t2_b5oajuh8,mmouse9799,0,1648163028.0,0,t1_i1ztjpz,i1ztjpz,True,tormontorcam,t3_tmqy2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tmqy2c/city_programs_for_young_children_in_somerville/,City Programs for Young Children in Somerville,/r/Somerville/comments/tmqy2c/city_programs_for_young_children_in_somerville/i1ztjpz/,7,r/Somerville,0,7

"MA Law has no default answer. It's essential up to the two parties to work something out. In theory, you could just walk away on Sept 1st without notifying your landlord. They would likely ask you well before this for their own planning purposes. This isn't true for month to month tenancies though - in that case you **are** expected to give 30 days notice on either side (landlord or tenant).

_Typically_ most folks will ask 30 days or more before their lease ends. Because their landlord might jack the rent, or not be interested in renewing for some reason like selling or flipping the property. So you need time to look for a new apartment too. Landlords will usually ask a few months ahead of time too in order to plan on either fixing the place, listing it, selling it or whatever they want to do.",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648139478.0,0,t1_i1y64w6,i1y64w6,False,cokdok,t3_tm4fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/,Landlord asking us to re-sign for Sept 1 lease already?,/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/i1y64w6/,1,r/Somerville,0,1

"The lease might not say this. Even if it does, I'm not aware of any laws preventing a landlord from asking whenever they feel like it.

Maybe the landlord wants to sell the place and cash out in this crazy market (my landlord wants to do this - fun times). If so, that could be why they're asking now. I already asked my landlord what his thoughts were on lease renewals after he decided to have a real estate agent come by and look at the place last week. 🙃",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648139179.0,0,t1_i1y5cdh,i1y5cdh,False,cokdok,t3_tm4fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/,Landlord asking us to re-sign for Sept 1 lease already?,/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/i1y5cdh/,1,r/Somerville,0,1
"90 days is typically the most a landlord will ask for, since it gives both parties a good range of flexibility. You get a good amount of time to decide and potentially look for a new place. They get 2 or 3 months of listing the apartment before the lease is up. I have the same clause in my lease personally (90 day notice).

This is quite early, but not too crazy. Some folks get asked in December what their plans are. That's typical around college neighborhoods that rely on students renting in the Spring for the Fall semester.

I would also add that there is no real legal protection for renewing a lease. The OP doesn't particularly have a ""right"" to ask for more time. They _can_ ask for more time, but once the discussion of lease renewal comes up it's a negotiation. Either party can walk away. If the OP asks for more time, they're gambling that the landlord will negotiate with them. They might not - the landlord can list the apartment on Craigslist if they want to and start showing the place with (typically) 24 hours notice.

The OP should basically spend this week thinking about their plans. If they're hesitant, maybe it's worth gambling and asking for more time to decide or asking questions. But if they think they're going to stay here another year, and the rent is acceptable, then I'd just renew and avoid any risk of being forced to move. Housing stability and maintaining the same rent is quite valuable in this absurd housing market. They should take a look at Zillow/Hotpads/Craigslist and see what similar apartments rent for. Consider if you're willing to fork over for a brokers fee or not, and how much you're willing to search for a new apartment. Do you have first/last/security deposit saved up already? You'll need that with how insane this market is. And possibly a brokers fee too if you can't find a non-real estate agent listed unit. OH and who knows what your new landlord will be like. Will they jack the rent +$500 next year? Who knows.

Basically, there's a lot of risk with pushing back. I'd consider my options and likely just renew unless there was a serious reason I might want to move soon.",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,0,1648138962.0,0,t1_i1y4rve,i1y4rve,False,cokdok,t3_tm4fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/,Landlord asking us to re-sign for Sept 1 lease already?,/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/i1y4rve/,5,r/Somerville,0,5

"> We are currently in a Sept 1 2021-Aug 31 2022 lease and just received a letter from our landlord asking us to decide on whether we would be resigning for the ‘22-‘23 year, with the decision deadline being the first week of April. We have friends with June 1 dates that haven’t even been contacted by their landlord yet. He is offering to keep the rent the same, which is great and somewhat unexpected, but we are not sure if we are ready to commit and re-sign when we are still nearly 6 months from the start of the next lease term.

Yeah I don't think it will either, but it's possible the OP's landlord has a different read on this market. OR isn't super greedy and just wants stability. Doesn't really matter either way I suppose, the OP is probably in the best position you can be in right now: no rent increase and a stable 12 month lease on the table.

> The other reason may be that they know that with a new tenant they'll need to make improvements to the apartment that OP is currently ignoring (broken dishwasher, peeling paint, etc.)

Actually that seems more likely. They figure OP is already at the max for rent they can get without investing time/money into the place, so they're looking to lock in the existing rental income for a while. Maybe they bother to do some work next year if they feel like it. I've also seen the housing renovation market be kind of insane - my parents waited weeks for a new stove last year for example.

"It's pretty typical that landlords start asking existing tenants in the spring whether they want to renew or not. They're mostly greedy old boomers who purchased their property for $50k in 1976 but they still see dollar signs like the rest of us and can't fathom losing out on $2000+/month in rental income. They generally want what we tenants want too: stability. Constant income coming in with good tenants who pay on time and do no or minimal damage to the unit is perfect.

Since your landlord is _not_ increasing the rent, I would recommend you sign ASAP. You can browse this sub, /r/boston, /r/CambridgeMA and /r/bostonhousing for at least a dozen cases of recent posts where the OP has been hit with a giant rent increase. This is unlikely for smaller landlords (those posts were almost all luxury buildings or corporate landlords) but still possible. You haven't mentioned what type of building you live in and every landlord is unique, so YMMV. Still, you seem to be in a good position compared to most.

You could ask for more time to decide, but honestly, why do you need time? Lock in some housing stability at the same rate now while you can. Should you need to move, you can ask about subleasing. Or perhaps ask _now_ if the landlord is open to a sublease on the unlikely chance you need to move. This should allow you and your roommate(s) or SO or what not to have a bit more flexibility if needed while still having much needed housing stability for the next 18 months.

I'd also leave you with an anecdote of how fortunate you are that your landlord is renewing. My first landlord decided to try selling their property (a 2 family) so they didn't renew my lease. I found a new landlord in Sept 2020 and resigned last year, but guess what he just told me for this year? Yup, he's trying to sell this property and doesn't seem open to a standard 12 month lease. So at least your landlord wants to keep you and isn't so greedy to try and cash out in this crazy housing market we're in. 🙃",t2_azwnj,Master_Dogs,1,1648125785.0,0,t1_i1x9edq,i1x9edq,True,cokdok,t3_tm4fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/,Landlord asking us to re-sign for Sept 1 lease already?,/r/Somerville/comments/tm4fuh/landlord_asking_us_to_resign_for_sept_1_lease/i1x9edq/,2,r/Somerville,0,2

Landlord might be reading the market differently than his greedy peers. There's no way these constant 40%+ rent increase posts can be sustainable in the long run. The landlord might think things will go south and wants to lock in an existing tenant at the same rate for an easy renewal and fairly easy renting for everyone involved. Landlord confirms s/he has another 12 months of rent, and the OP doesn't get hit with a rent increase or booted because the landlord decided to sell the property.

There's really no benefit to not locking this in now. Maybe there's risk if a marketing crash happens - but those are extremely unlikely. We'd need a new pandemic to return to what the crazy 2020 rental market looked like. If the OP decides they want to move next year, subleases are pretty easy to find and most landlords do not mind if you vet them. Worse case the OP finds themselves staying in the area a bit longer than they want, or perhaps moving out a month or two early and paying for 2 places for that time.

I think that Cross St is in a similar multi-year improvement cycle, but at the moment I can’t find details, other than the list of “Improvement Projects” links on the [Construction](https://www.somervillema.gov/detours) page.

Anyway, TLDR the city is working block-by-block to improve the street infrastructure, pretty much across the whole city. A lot of the water system, for example, is \~150 years old now, and way overdue for an overhaul. A lot of the street surfaces aren’t in great shape, but it doesn’t make sense to repave them when they’re about to get dug up again, so the general strategy is to get the underground improvements finished, then rework the surface. Sounds like Cross St is one of the current focus areas.",t2_6j334vbi,chdevers,0,1648086420.0,0,t1_i1vm4k0,i1vm4k0,True,Not_Just_A_Guy,t3_tkvkbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tkvkbq/what_construction_is_going_on_near_cross_street/,"What Construction is going on Near Cross Street, East Somerville ?",/r/Somerville/comments/tkvkbq/what_construction_is_going_on_near_cross_street/i1vm4k0/,2,r/Somerville,0,2

"Here’s what’s likely happening:

The building owner is getting a fine almost every time. They are ok with that because that fine is still cheaper than properly disposing of the trash, even if it’s messed up, they have likely just done the calculation is is saving hundreds a year.

So here’s what you can do, because just posting here won’t do anything since your neighbors aren’t likely on Reddit:

You’ll have to escalate this beyond just fees. Contact your city council person about this, will take two seconds to look it up online. Ask them for advice on what to do. Then go door to door and talk to your neighbors. Show them the pics you post here. Talk to them about how this is illegal, gross. Give them your city council person’s number and email, ask them to email or call them. Also give them your email and ask them to CC you on it as well so the council person knows your organizing this.

"One US senator, one US congressperson, the mayor of Somerville, eight Somerville city councilors, three state representatives, and one state senator all attended the [CAAS press conference this past Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tfytg2/dont_let_the_glx_become_the_gentrification_line/). They were there to listen to three tenants complain about threats of being displaced from their homes. They were not there to talk or to be typical self-aggrandizing politicians, although Markey couldn't resist the urge to leap in front of the microphone at the end which was kinda amusing.

But this is the internet. And online, there is this huge fleet of braindead jackasses who claim things that aren't real, like the idea that those who attended the CAAS Press Conference or support their mission are all Maoists or all communists or should get on a plane to North Korea or have rage issues and are about to shoot up a Whole Foods.

Some of the users posting below are sad reminders of the millions in the US who are against representative democracy and believe that an organized public speaking to their representatives is not American. These are the vile ones. They think the American Way is not representatives listening to their constituents. It makes them so upset that they must misrepresent reality online over and over again. Representative government makes people like them so upset that they broke into the US Capitol last year to smear shit on the walls and twirl a noose around.

Tenants have rights, you braindead harassing, language-abusing, history-abusing trolls who are against reality and against representative democracy. They really do.

"Migraines for one.  There are a number of clinics out there where some doctor has realized doctoring is hard, and instead they can line up a patient every 5 minutes asking some cursory questions and then sign off on a card for $1-200.  It's transparently corrupt, and ludicrously easy if you cough out the cash, and makes you wonder if this gravy train is related to how recreational is so slow to take off.

For it to be worth it you have to make the money back the 20% tax.  I think you're looking at around $200 a year to maintain a card, so you have to spend $1k to make it worthwhile.  Which for most of us is a *lot* of weed, even at the absurd prices.  But for some heavy stoners it's just a month or so.  For reference, my partner and I vape some flower every evening, and spend about $2-300 a year between us, so totally not worth getting a card except I have to go to Arlington right now to get some.

AFAIK in Oregon they had medical, voted for recreational, and so the next day every dispensary just opened their doors to everyone of age.

"That is an interesting observation!  All the non-squares you list seem like super well known very specific place names.  

Here's my random speculation based on no insider knowledge or anything: for brevity, they'll leave off the ""Square"" is possible, but will include it if they think there's any possibility of confusion, or if the square isn't well known. Applying my bullshit speculation on a case-by-case basis:

* ""Sullivan"", being a common Irish surname, is a fairly common Boston toponym, so maybe it's there to differentiate. The Google footprint of ""Sullivan Boston"" seems occupied by Sullivan's South Boston on Castle Island, while ""Sullivan Charleston Boston"" goes to Sullivan's Pub.

* ""Jackson"" is another super common place name, there's Jackson Commons and even more than one Jackson Square.

* ""Union"", in addition to being a not uncommon name for a square, is also the name of an Oyster House, a church, a brunch restaurant, etc...  Far too common a word.

* ""Gilman"" is the name of a street in Boston and a street in Somerville. Also, might be case of it not being a well known square, especially since the area is often subsumed into the better known ""Winter Hill"" neighborhood label.

* ""Magoun"" doesn't have a whole lot to confuse it with.  Might just not be well known.  Seems like leaving off ""Square"" would have been perfectly safe.

* ""Ball"" is just a really short name, the only single-syllable name station name I can think of besides ""State"".  Also, ball being a relatively common everyday name?  Maybe also not well known as a square in Greater Boston?",t2_p8ns7km,innergamedude,0,1648037166.0,0,t1_i1s9bhl,i1s9bhl,False,innergamedude,t3_tk1gaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tk1gaz/mbta_map_is_updated/,MBTA map is updated!,/r/Somerville/comments/tk1gaz/mbta_map_is_updated/i1s9bhl/,1,r/Somerville,0,1

"Last time I heard (mainly through reading articles), what was causing delay was the amount of time it took to do the electrical work in the traction power substations. I don't know exactly why that was, but I can remember John Dalton being quoted on something about the means & methods assumptions not being correct. Your guess is as good as mine but I thought that maybe indoor COVID restrictions maybe affected the construction schedule in that regard. I think, though, that now that the Union spur is open, test trains might get started on the Medford branch soon. I think the testing phase takes about three months, so it's possible that we're still on schedule for the ""SPRING/SUMMER 2022"" signs that have been posted on some of the maps.

"GLX was certainly expensive but the comment a few back above really undersells the amount of infrastructure that went into it. It's not simply some new ties, rail, and concrete. If you're ever out in the Inner Belt, you can take a walk around and look at the amount of viaducts, retaining walls, and bridges (more on bridges in a sec) that went into it. That stuff isn't cheap. Add in elevators at every station and you're looking a several million for each, sometimes approaching 8-digits. Then there's all of the signal infrastructure for normal operation of the trains, overhead catenary for the support, the traction power substations (I know of at least two), and an entire vehicle maintenance facility, which also serves as a facility to operators (break room, lockers, offices, etc.). Let's not forget the fact that the program also replaced the Washington Street bridge, the School St bridge, the Medford St bridge, the Ball Square bridge along Broadway, and the Harvard St bridge in Medford. There's likely other stuff I'm leaving out that goes into the stations like comms., emergency/life safety stuff, lighting, etc.

Transit construction is overpriced in the US compared to other places in the world. There's no arguing that. As riders, we'll really only ever see a limited amount of the infrastructure that supports operations.

"As I previously said, I don’t want more unnecessary restrictions that will lead to a major halt in development. I don’t think rent control for example has any impact on housing development.

What I really disagree with is your notion that poor minority residents will be priced out regardless. That is not inevitable! If we implement targeted rent controls and continue to build more dense housing to satiate the young professional desire to move here, the low income community here will be able to stay. Does that require us limiting the profit someone can make on a housing investment by raising rents to match the insane demand? Yes. I’m interested in a solution that keeps the people who’ve been here for years housed. Landlords in this case will make less profit than they could make otherwise, yes. They’ll still make a profit however. Their investment will be a good one, it just won’t be the goldmine it currently is on the backs of people who have the least in our community and many of whom have been here the longest.

You may disagree with that direction and think it punishes those who invested in the housing stock here, but frankly I don’t care.

"It’s simply a fact that rent has gone up disproportionately to wages. 56% of those earning $30,000-$45,000 spend more than half their income on rent. 17% of those earning $45,000-$75,000 spend more than half their income on rent.

If you’d like to go ahead and call that absolutely gigantic percentage of people idiots for spending so much, then I guess go ahead. But when 50%+ of a group of people are making economic decisions like that, there’s usually more going on than everyone being a dumbass. People have little choice but to spend inordinate amounts on rent these days.

I really don’t think it’s so unreasonable that renters like myself are calling for more affordable housing to be built and/or rent prices to be stabilized. If you’re against rent control, then you better be for building more housing. Most landlords are against both because they want to maintain a monopoly on a valuable resource. There’s simply not enough homes anyone can afford anymore for the people who work in and around the city.

People haven’t had their wages increase to match costs, we haven’t built more homes to match demand, and yes therefore people are now calling for rent control because in lieu of those 2 changes, it seems reasonable that rent prices shouldn’t skyrocket on top of that.

I seriously urge you to read more about the issue and talk to actual renters like myself. I work a decent job as recent college grad, I save money and limit my expenses. Still, I don’t see myself ever being able to buy a home anywhere near Somerville or the surrounding area because so much of my income goes to paying my rent. It’s a cycle that is effecting most people my age (besides the very elite who work in tech/finance/consulting which make up a small percentage of us) and will ultimately hurt places like Somerville.",t2_ckyz1,damienrapp98,0,1647881634.0,0,t1_i1jtp8e,i1jtp8e,False,darkhelmut1,t3_tj9amd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tj9amd/looking_good/,looking good,/r/Somerville/comments/tj9amd/looking_good/i1jtp8e/,5,r/Somerville,0,5

"> You're clearly misrepresenting OP who seems to be advocating for building more housing more equitably.

Thank you for noticing.

This [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/537479a) from a few years back discusses four broad benign forces under capitalism that could decrease inequality. Some of the four are more applicable to inequality related to building housing than others. Because history shows that inequality has always been cyclical, either some combination of those benign forces must be put into place or dramatic malign forces that decrease inequality (such as ""epidemics, civil conflict, state breakdown and war"") will occur. Historical data on wages and incomes stretching back to the 1200s seems to show that without application of the benign forces, the malign forces are inevitable.

That's why building more housing in a manner that increases inequality is so short sighted compared to building more housing in a manner that decreases inequality.

"The neoliberal ""supply and demand"" solution to solving housing for all people just doesn't hold water. Saying, it's ""just supply and demand"" as if they have some simple push/pull relationship is just not in line with reality. It assumes the unlikely scenario that supply can greatly \_exceed\_ demand (the only way prices drop). Developers don't keep building once the profit margin gets to thin, but neolibs somehow believe that developers are going to build to the point they are  losing money in a free market?

"Global capital flows freely, yes, but flows from A to B can be direct and strong or tortuous and weak.

REITs are a direct and strong method of funding evil. A tenant's rent benefits powerful REIT investors who create misery far away from where the tenants live. That's like rent causing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to warfare.  A tenant's rent benefiting an individual homeowner who pays a bank for a mortgage with funds that later do something somewhere after a step or two to finance those same people is not comparable. That's like my rent being Caesar's last breath and warfare a thousand years later breathes in a few atoms. This is particularly true if the bank involved is a credit union with a strong local focus. You are the one being disingenuous and ridiculous by equating strong-and-direct flows with tortuous-and-weak flows.

Inequality in the United States is quite possibly higher than in any other society at any time in the past, anywhere in the world. My analogy to colonization nearly two days ago was in the sense of policies for control by one people over other people with the aim of economic dominance.

Who are the colonizers? The relatively few individuals who have amassed previously unimaginable fortunes from the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate sectors of our economy are the colonizers.

They have legally corrupted our government at all levels through lobbying. Unlike medical and engineering professions, the training for these fields contains no ethical standards, no honor societies of note, no education for the greater societal good. Economic domination is their purpose, and it's been achieved through deregulation, over-representation in local governments, reducing the power of government, and increasing the power of corporations. This is particularly true in the case of real estate investment trusts which concentrate power for entire neighborhoods into the hands of a tiny number of corporate executives who don't live in those neighborhoods.

Who owns my neighborhood? Thousands of different people, similar to what's worked in New England since the 1600s. In my neighborhood, the owners still very often live here. Economic domination of renter-residents by their homeowner-neighbors can and does happen, but it is not at a large scale. It's at the scale of individual families and thousands of dollars.

Who owns Assembly? Most of it is owned by an REIT, a form of ownership and power which didn't even exist anywhere in the US before 1960. In Assembly, the residents are the commodity. Their dehumanization and economic domination is not only the business plan, but the REIT executives have a **fiduciary obligation to investors to exploit the residents as a resource** as much as they possibly can.",t2_jxlwt,mshelikoff,0,1647666618.0,0,t1_i18ykjr,i18ykjr,False,mshelikoff,t3_tfytg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tfytg2/dont_let_the_glx_become_the_gentrification_line/,"""Don't let the GLX become the Gentrification Line!""

"Eh, not quite. I think the mythology of homeownership you're buying into has driven a lot of the terrible housing policies that make Somerville unaffordable. A soulless $4000-5000/mo glass box in Assembly can easily pull 100-200 people with the $$ to displace a 2BR or 3BR triple decker in Somerville or a SFH in West Rox... building that housing takes them off the market and thus relieves a little bit of pressure. Building 10 Assemblies would relieve A LOT of pressure!

Your argument against building rental housing bc ""follow the money"" is even more ridiculous than your original colonialism argument. Your landlord uses your rent to pay his mortgage at a bank... and that bank is certainly both financed by and facilitates the same flows of global capital you are railing against. So I think your confidence that your rent is not indirectly financing wars in Yemen... is misplaced by your own reasoning!  Homeownership just cuts out the landlord middleman. And I could make all kinds of arguments about how the mythology of American homeownership is creating massive urban sprawl, decimating the environment, making us ever-more car and fossil fuel dependent, but I won't bc that's just a step removed from the kind of ""Assembly=colonialism"" way of arguing I am pushing back against.

You're taking the mundane argument of ""what should Somerville's housing policy be?"" into some grandiose argument about Putin and Saudi warlords and global investment patterns. It's totally fine to disagree and argue about Somerville housing policy, but trying to push a preferred argument on the mundane question by throwing out words like ""weapons purchases"" ""hideous oppression"" ""forced migrations and wars"" is a very disingenuous and deceitful way of arguing about the mundane question.",t2_cfbmuqph,Reasonable_Move9518,0,1647652732.0,0,t1_i1891ez,i1891ez,False,mshelikoff,t3_tfytg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/tfytg2/dont_let_the_glx_become_the_gentrification_line/,"""Don't let the GLX become the Gentrification Line!""

"Ah yes... Inman is walking distance to Central and I failed to remember this fact. Inman is maybe 2-3 min closer to the Union stop now, but I stand corrected.

I think I always think Inman is a transit desert bc when I first moved here, back when Somerville was Slummerville and a hole-in-the-wall 3BR was <$700/person,  I lived in Brookline and agreed to meet a friend of a friend at their place ""in Inman but on the Union side"". It was a 25 minute slog at night through pouring rain (which I was NOT dressed for!), past empty autobody shops and truck parking lots and falling down triple deckers and heavily tattooed grad students and/or baristas on fixed-gear bikes.

But this is wrong... Inman itself is quite close to Central and the ""Inman on the Union side"" 3BRs are now probably more like $1400/person, and the grad students are gone... and after Monday... will be an easy 5 min walk from the T station they promised us way back when!",t2_cfbmuqph,Reasonable_Move9518,1,1647650888.0,0,t1_i185785,i185785,False,Stanwellz,t3_thdn3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/thdn3o/service_to_the_green_line_station_at_union_square/,"Service to the Green Line station at Union Square starts Monday, March 21st.

Today, I pay a sizeable chunk of my income for rent to an individual homeowner who lives near me. I'm not best buddies with my landlord, but I am confident the profits from my housing are not used for weapons purchases, hideous oppression, tyrant support, death and destruction.

"Your issue is that you undermine your own arguments throwing around words like ""neoliberalism"" and ""colonialism"". 1) you don't like Assembly, and think it is too expensive, doesn't have enough homeowners, too corporate etc. 2) you wish the area had been developed differently (maybe some type of owner's co-op, or townhomes/triple deckers instead of larger buildings, or something else). These are reasonable positions to take, and have reasonable lessons for future developments in Somerville/Greater Boston and beyond. I don't agree with your viewpoint, but we can at least have a discussion framing things in these terms and maybe find common ground, a compromise, a partial solution.

Suppose I agree with you on 1) and 2). Is Assembly SO HORRIBLE that it can be equated with neo-liberalism? Such a comparison makes zero sense... Assembly is a (in your eyes) poorly-developed neighborhood, neoliberalism in the classic sense is a foreign policy. The neighborhood is SO BAD that the damage done is comparable to the hundreds of thousands of lives and mass destruction of the Iraq War. It's so awful that's it's ""an act of colonization"", which you specifically link to the centuries of mass exploitation and genocide  in the Congo.

**I'm sorry, but such comparisons are absolutely ridiculous.** Comparing the imperfect development of Assembly to the horrors of European colonialism is frankly insulting to the victims of European colonialism. It's pure virtue signaling and hyperbole.... you're trying to say ""if you're not with me, you're on the same side as the neoliberals and the colonialists""! This is not how one wins an argument, or advances an issue. It cuts off all avenues for consensus, common ground, and compromise.

And it's ultimately counterproductive... many leftists are using some strident language to manufacture consensus around legitimately complex and nuanced issues.

If Somerville had no choices for the Assembly area other than either an empty field or ownership by a real estate investment trust then they made the right choice.

I believe other choices were possible that would have spread wealth to a greater number of people in a new neighborhood with a huge number of homeowners, and that T station still would have been built, and shops, restaurants, and office spaces still would have come. But that's just a belief. Maybe the rest of the US and the rest of the world have been devastated by neo-liberal greed to such a huge extent that a new neighborhood with many homeowners wasn't possible for a city like Somerville at the time the decisions were made. I'm not an expert about the choices available to municipalities at that time.

"Perhaps, for those of us without an irrational fear of roundabouts, what it needs is a double roundabout, since the entrances are so spread.  However, that proposal would cause locals to have kittens.

I think the center could be moved to near the college/Powderhouse end, and the far entrances migrated inwards, and then it could be a very conventional, not weirdly oversized, largely-round, roundabout.

Perhaps that's the plan for if/when there's budget to build physical changes beyond paint and posts.

Six weeks later, when that same cat needed another unexpected surgery, they were kind enough to let me do a payment plan.

When my cat passed, they took the time to send flowers expressing their condolences. I can't say they do that for everyone, because I had built up a relationship with them via my chronically sick cat. That being said, it says a lot about how they care about their clients.

"TL;DR: I am salty about veterinarian pay, also finding the best vet for you & your pet is legit hard.

I'd be interested to see some sort of price comparison of area vets.One of my family members is a vet and part of their schooling was pointing out why you need to charge people for services. Vets also have a higher suicide rate than gen pop. The vet who took care of my family's childhood pets died of a drug overdose in his forties.

Which is not to say that there aren't vets out there ripping people off. Of course there are. But my two cents is this is the exception and not the rule. People don't become vets to make money. (Also not implying that this is what you were saying.) That being said, the relationship with the individual vet is what's most important, and that's based on all sorts of factors.

"I was thinking of Mystic Ave, which that part before Hancock St is MassDOT since it's technically State Route 38. But you're right, Mystic Valley Parkway (Route 16) is actually a DCR parkway. And Harvard St is a City of Medford Street. So yay, 3 different departments probably claim ownership or pass the buck at that intersection. :)))

(You can look up the road where Mystic Valley Parkway meets Main St in Medford for how much the State gives a shit about intersections. They've got flashing traffic lights because the State refuses to do jack shit and Medford is powerless plus broke. The best solution? Do nothing, let the lights flash and block a few turns while the State sits on their ass and doesn't do anything)

EDIT: The Medford Bike Committee has a fantastic page [here](http://www.medfordbikes.org/reporting-road-hazards.html) on who owns what road in Medford. Interestingly they have Route 16 marked as MassDOT, but I'm 90% sure you're correct and that is actually a DCR parkway. EDIT2: actually, I bet the existence of i93 right next to that roadway forces MassDOT to claim ownership since there's a highway off ramp right next to this intersection. And highway exits/off ramps up and down Mystic Ave. You can see they have the park of Mystic Valley Parkway before i93 marked as DCR but once it gets close to i93 it's MassDOT according to the Medford Bike Committee.

"There's also the Union Sq development called [Discover Union Sq](https://www.discoverusq.com/) that will bring around 1,000 new housing units to the area. If other projects get built of small to mid sized buildings we could be seeing quite a few new housing units on the market. Difficult to say how much impact that will have, but more housing units typically helps.

Plus it'll vary from person to person. Smaller landlords might not jack the rent if you're a good tenant and they fear the unknown that a new tenant can bring. Plus a lot of landlords have owned their property for decades, so it doesn't matter as much to them. Corporate landlords will definitely use this as a way to jack the rent, since they just see dollar signs. Then there's in between options like a landlord who owns a half dozen units; who knows, they may be greedy, they might be reasonable.

I'd assume overall the average rent _will_ go up due to the overall lack of housing in the region and country as a whole, and new transit lines when built on their own like GLX typically do bring a lot of demand to the neighborhood. We should be pushing the State to invest in other transit lines, like Commuter Rail, so that this one area doesn't get hit by a huge influx in demand.

"There's no way the city will ever go back to that old 1970's era circle of death contraption that was there before. MassDOT might be a few decades behind Somerville but fortunately all new designs are much less car centric and much more focused on providing better pedestrian/cyclist crossings.

">Do you honestly believe it is that simple? The idea that supply can ever meet demand in a city like this seems unrealistic. Even when prices were stabilizing demand continued unabated.

It needs to be a regional solution. I agree, Somerville on it's own cannot solve the problem. Regionally though allowing much more housing focused around public transit will be a huge part of the solution. Somerville had about 100k residents in 1930. Population has increased 3x since then while housing supply here in Somerville dropped 20%. I don't know of anywhere in the Boston area where housing supply kept up with population growth. If the supply isn't matching the demand growth, steadily increasing prices should be expected.

>I'd argue that it's developers, banks, and now private equity firms in power. They are the ones controlling the housing market and housing prices, not homeowners.

I agree with some of this. Current zoning laws heavily favor developers because of the cost to make even minor changes. It's unfortunate, and definitely part of the problem. Banks only care about writing and selling mortgages. They provide the money both to big developers and new home buyers. I'd say they're in the mix, but kind of a chaotic neutral if you will. Private equity only owns like 2% of rentals nationally. Even in markets they focus on it's maybe 10-20%. They're only here because it's profitable. Allow more housing, stabilize prices, and private equity will be less interested.

>Lastly, I just say that any theory were the premise is ""give people their +1M condos so that people making $40-50k have a place to live"" is definitely a form of trickledown magic thinking—which was the idea that taking care of the top benefits the bottom.

Trickle down economics was literally about giving money to rich people. I'm proposing allowing the construction and taxation of market rate units so that the wealthy can blow their money on new units and get out of the way of new homeowners. The South is allowing a TON of new construction, and the result is that housing hasn't increased in cost quite as dramatically as it has in urban areas.

"The sad thing is if we had built all the expansions that were proposed in the 40's we'd be in a much better spot now. GLX gets this crap because it's the only expansion we've bothered to fund, and only because the City of Somerville sued the State of MA to force it to hold up its end of the Big Dig deal.

Electrify all the Commuter Rail lines, and force all those shitty burbs to add a thousand housing units around each station. BAM. Suddenly you have 50k+ housing units with T access to Boston and the surrounding metro. Require all housing developments to keep 20% or so of new units as affordable units. Now we have thousands of new affordable housing units. The State won't bother to do this unless the Gov is some crazy transit nerd and pushes for it though.

And while we're at it fix all the other stupid things about our transit system. Connect North & South shore lines via a North South Rail Link. Connect the Blue & Red lines.

Before the modern neoliberal era, this was common. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_City_housing_cooperatives . Those cooperative towers exist in the real world. Many still provide homes in the real world. Today.

But are they still being built today?  No. Anti-cooperative, pro-hypercapitalist fundamentalism spread along with its nonsensical shortsightedness about what ""is actually cheaper"" with no consideration of long-term impacts and secondary impacts.

Read what this guy writes. Because a 30 story tower cannot be constructed by an individual middle class homeowner, the only option is to turn to multinational real estate investment trusts. What a valid point that would be...if only one homeowner lived in the tower.

The answer will almost certainly be yes, so even ownership of towers by cooperative middle-class housing is still possible. The fundamentalists haven't completely destroyed the middle yet.

"I have to interject after stumbling into this argument with something I noticed when it comes to density. Somerville is [actually one of the densest cities in the US](https://slate.com/business/2013/06/somerville-density-without-tall-buildings.html) (sorry about the semi-old article, too late at night and I'm too tired to find and cite a more recent source). 

Apparently triple decker's can really house a lot of people per sq mile. I do find it paradoxical, but it doesn't change that the data shows mass triple-deckers can provide equal or even more density than high-rises. Somerville is the prime example - and Somerville used to be even denser.  

So along with pointing out triple deckers can actually house as much per mile as ""big buildings"", OP is also broaching at another concept recently recognize ""Missing Middle Housing"". Overall, Missing Middle Housing is about how zoning regulations has left us with either mass urban sprawl of single family housing or high-rise towers, which is tangential to the topic. But it does cover something relevant - how multi-family family housing acted as a vehicle for social mobility as lots of individuals invest and build housing. 

But large lots and the rise of the 5-over-1 construction favors single large corporations as only an organization with lots of capital can build on such scales. 

Now, you did said Alloy was built as a condo so it is still individual homeowners. Maybe that does address the alternative of diving blocks into small plots and letting homeowners build multi-family housing. I don't know, but I think the massively downvoted OP does seem to have a point back by actual urban designers. OP is not presenting it very well with starting premise sounding too similar to NIMBYs who wants no construction except single family housing. But the last comments in the chain actually does sounds like advocacy and design towards urbanism. 

It's too late for Assembly, but small divisions of land per block and allowing housing to not be single family housing does have evidence and history of proving large quantities of housing while more able to be much accessible to people. But these days, building the housing that allowed Somerville to be one of the densest cities in the US is literally illegal.

I believe other choices were possible that would have spread wealth to a greater number of people in a new neighborhood with a huge number of homeowners, and that T station still would have been built, and shops, restaurants, and office spaces still would have come.
