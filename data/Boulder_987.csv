"I agree, download \*everything\* that you can now. Access will get shut down over time, and it's a huge hassle of red tape to get it later.

While much of this will depend on your situation, here are my other suggestions:

Know that her bank accounts will be frozen until the estate is established. This can be a real problem for you if cash is tight, as there will be expenses. If your partner has the power to do so, move some money now.

Do what you can to help sort financial details: what accounts exist, where are they, who are the vendors that need to get paid, is there a safety deposit box and who can get access, is there a will and where is it. What can you learn about online accounts and passwords? This assumes your partner will be handling the estate. 

The executor will need multiple copies of the death certificate, at least a good handful and more if the estate is complex. They're cheaper and easier to get up front. 

It may be too late, as she probably has to give permission, but a very inexpensive way to go is to donate her body for research. My experience is with medical colleges, out of state, so I can't speak to what's available in Colorado or what the rules are here. The cremains were returned to us months later.

Funeral homes are required to publish prices. The more services you ask for, the higher the price. Cheapest would be simple cremation, no viewing. Full on service with embalming, casket, and a burial plot will escalate the price dramatically. You should be able to find much of this info online. Whatever you do, knowing who you're going to use and what their phone number is when the time comes makes that day much easier.

If she's in home hospice or in a facility, they will help deal with the immediate declaration and forms. If it's an unattended death, you need to call the local police dispatch, they will then reach out to the coroner's office to declare death.  

The funeral home will probably be the one to contact social security. Note that social security will freeze the bank account and claw back any payments that cover the period after her death. This may also screw up any automated bank payments (I'd set up auto payments for my mom for just about everything, and wasn't able to catch it all in time, so got stuck arguing about late or cancelled payment fees.)

If she's in a hospital, nursing home, or in hospice, ask what resources they have available. They may at least be able to share lists of information. It never hurts to ask.

I'm not saying this is an ethically good thing to do, but I was quite surprised to learn that we (her children or her estate) were not liable to pay off her credit card balance. So any charges you can make on her behalf while she is still alive...

"I don't have a lot of information about Boulder-specific options, but can offer some general advice, having been in your position three weeks ago.

The cheapest option is direct cremation, with no wake or funeral. The price range in my area was $850 at the cheapest and $2900 at the most expensive. It is generally cheaper if you approach a crematorium rather than a funeral home. The cheaper options sometimes work only on weekdays and can take a while to return cremains. I ended up shelling out for a funeral home because they worked on the weekend and my mom wanted dad's cremains back with her ASAP. Be mindful that you will get the cremains in a plastic or cardboard box, unless you supply an urn and they transfer the ashes into that. I really recommend purchasing your own urn if you can afford it, one that's suitable and reflects the person, because seeing the remains of someone you care about in a flimsy box... does not feel good.

Another thing I recommend is finding a place that is in close proximity to the hospital/home/hospice and confirming that they've worked with the hospital/home/hospice.

If burial is important to you and your partner, keep in mind it will be at least twice as expensive, and the cost rapidly increases with types of casket, embalming, etc. Likewise, doing a wake or a funeral will also make the cost go up considerably. Expect to pay for more than one death certificate. Those will be important for shutting down financials.

Also, a weird thing that might not happen, but I'm gonna bring up since it blindsided me: if your partner has access or is running his mom's medical accounts in the same facility where she is going to pass, download all available material ASAP. My dad died at Stanford in the late evening, and they'd locked the account by morning.

"Do you honestly think this is some kind of ""gotcha"" analogy?

A movie theater is a place where movies are shown. That's why people typically sit in the dark inside movie theatres. A coffee shop is a place where coffee is sold. That's why people typically drink coffee inside coffee shops. Hope that helps buddy.

"Haha. Yea helping the old lady down the street get out in the snow, calling in two garages open in the middle of the night and an open car door, let another neighbor know they left their garage open. Letting other neighbors know that someone's entire garage was emptied of bikes... yea I'm a horrible neighbor. My thing is people on this sub generally only accept a post if its one of the following. Then lash out at anyone else. Its a mob on here.

Accepted posts:
Some type of generic virtuous or a seemingly virtuous post. Say o lets help the homeless. Or damn lets do something about high rent.

A pic of the flatirons or sunset.

A question about some random food place.

An update on some local event.


Its really interesting how many people complain about rent and fail to see how ticketing people like this would hurt someone less well off. Yea I'm pissed that some lazy ass neighbor took the low road and decided getting someone a ticket will resolve their tiny inconvienience. Perhaps they did assume someone was living in it. Which is actually funny if you spent 15 seconds looking at it you would know. Talking to 2 neighbors would pretty much garentee the owner would be found. So then you add in the dogpile effect where everyone just assumes people are assclowns. 

Maybe i could be nicer but the same applies to people's response. We get what we give. So people give me flak i will give it back. Read the Denver reddit. Wyatts towing takes peoples car in their paid for spots. Its pretty much the same issue. However its unanimous that everyone on the Denver reddit hates that company. The difference here is just saddening. Boulder claims to be a progressive accepting community but is it really? Perhaps if i said hey guys I'm late on rent and now i can't pay because this fine. Talk about how being broke is the reason i haven't updated the registration. People would flock to praise and offer help and condemn the neighbor. But no if its just genuine not knowing holy shit every calls you a demon. See what I'm saying here? Also notice how i didn't call you anything. Its because you actually provide input that although critical, you are at least civil. 

I know for a fact i wouldn't call on a neighbor.

"Coffee shops have been a bastion for intellectual pursuit (i.e studying, writing) since the enlightenment. Unlike movie theaters playing movies, coffee shops don’t exist to play music. What they exist to do is serve coffee, and whatever else the owner intends for it.  

Traditionally, that’s been a place where you can chat or focus on something, neither of which can happen comfortably in most coffee shops nowadays. Because loud music means people leave. And people leaving means tables are available. When tables are available, people who go to the coffee shop to chat/work/study/write see that tables are available, buy the coffee, and try to chat/work.

"We had a terrible experience there. The vet was not calm and made the situation significantly more stressful than it had to be. When they took our cat in from the get go they told us our kitty was “too far gone even if we start treatment now.” They were also incredibly inconsistent with the information they were giving us on what our cat needed for treatment. We ended up giving them over $1k to treat our kitty but ended up taking our cat out early from their treatment plan because we were very uncomfortable from their inconsistency. We took kitty to her normal vet for a blood panel after we took her out and she was completely healthy. 

Also the emergency vet that was treating our cat was very rude and disrespectful towards the nurses and vet techs that were helping us and said things such as  “they don’t know what they are talking about so I don’t know why you would talk to them” which I find to be off putting for someone to talk about their staff like that. 

We might have just had a bad vet because our primary vet did tell us they have a lot of different vets going in and out of that practice. So it might be hit or miss depending on the day you go.

"I would ask that you walk on the right instead. As both a runner and a cyclist, I’ve had trouble with people walking on the left. One problem is that they can’t see who’s coming behind them (which can be two abreast, or somebody passing someone else at the same time). So they don’t realize I need more space to safely get around them and I have to stop dead to avoid a collision. Also it makes going past you much more stressful if I’m running and cyclists are passing me at high speed as I swing wide around you (this is much easier if we’re going the same way as I can just slow down a bit and assess when to pass with no time limit, or if we’re going opposite ways and you’re on the right because then the people passing me can see you and it’s their responsibility to safely pass). Or I’m the one going the same direction as them but on the right, just as someone swings wide to pass them the other way.

Boulder fire crews are responding to a structure fire on Kalmia Avenue Friday morning.

Boulder Fire-Rescue spokeswoman Dionne Waugh said dispatchers received a smoke call at 4:53 a.m. Friday, and crews responded to find flames already visible.

Waugh said the fire involved at least one apartment building in the 2800 block of Kalmia Avenue, and that 24 families have been displaced.

There have been no reported injuries.

Boulder Fire-Rescue in a tweet asked people to avoid the area, but Waugh said firefighters have extinguished the fire except for a few hot spots.

Waugh said the exact cause of the fire is not known at this time, but investigators believe it started in the upper part of the building, allowing it to spread through the attic above the sprinkler system.",t2_4qkpx,aydengryphon,0,1648221149.0,0,t1_i22o5oj,i22o5oj,False,fontanese,t3_tnljvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tnljvh/fire_burns_another_apt_complex/,Fire burns another apt. complex,/r/boulder/comments/tnljvh/fire_burns_another_apt_complex/i22o5oj/,5,r/boulder,0,5

"It really depends on the emergency- basic things like a laceration, vomiting/diarrhea etc that might be handled at your regular vet during the day,. Boulder emergency pet clinic is a great option. If it's something likely to require more intensive care and possibly a specialist, Boulder Road or CASE are specialty hospitals and thus have more extensive diagnostic and treatment facilities. 

When in doubt you can always call your regular vet (you have one, right?'if you don't, I recommend you schedule an exam now so that they can legally give you advice over the phone when it's an emergency) and see what they recommend.

Be forewarned, all vets are woefully understaffed right now so CALL AHEAD. I've seen basically all the 24/7 ERS around here CLOSED due to staffing issues at times in the last year. Even CSUs HOSPITAL was closed for a while. 

Be prepared for LONG waits- you're going to get triaged. You might wait six + hours. That means there are more urgent cases being seen before yours so that's a silver lining. 

It's going to seem expensive to you. You have accident insurance or savings right? Keeping a hospital staffed and open 24/7 when all the same equipment as a human hospital but without human insurance paying for it all is expensive. Expect to pay 3-4x more than what you would pay at your regular GP DVM for the same service at the ER. Understand that the doctor who is ""short"" with you may have been working for the last 18 hours with a skeleton crew, managing critically ill patients from the operating room while in the middle of surgery, all the while probably being paid less than a human nurse and with a massive amount of student loan debt and probably yelled at by.clients about how the care they're providing should cost less. None of them are trying to be dicks- they're just stupid busy and exhausted trying to keep up and they're there because they care. Nobody is price gouging. If anything 99% of veterinarians are guilty of not charging appropriately for their services.

If your pet is sick, don't wait to see if it gets better on its own. That's when things go critical and are $$$$ to try to fix when they might have been easy things to fix 24 hours earlier.

Anyways - to;dr is make sure you have a current (Exam in the last year even if not due for vaccines) relationship with a GP you like so you can ask them for advice and get accident insurance so that you don't worry about taking your pet to the best facility when it's needed and recommended.

Be nice to your veterinary staff because they're more burned out than you know.",t2_13ufik4e,DrRockstar99,0,1648214549.0,0,t1_i228kf8,i228kf8,True,ElevatedGrape,t3_tmovn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tmovn4/can_someone_please_recommend_a_walk_inemergency/,Can someone please recommend a walk in/emergency veterinary clinic?

"Hello! Unfortunately I got talked into working for them up until a few weeks ago. Stand for the Silent IS a legit charity. The people who approached you work for a marketing firm that sends people out to essentially solicit (they don’t like to call it that, but let’s be honest, that’s exactly what it is) people for money to keep the education and counseling free for the schools. 

I left the marketing firm working for them in my area because the entire thing felt shady. The marketing firms working for them are funded solely by the donations, from the bottom up. Commission starts at THIRTY percent of the donations. And that’s just what it starts at entry level. SFTS has a strict code of ethics, one of which being honesty and not lying to pull donations, however the marketing firm I worked for absolutely encouraged lying and shady practices. 

For example, the companies largest day of profit for SFTS while I worked there company wide was over $180,000. $54,000 is what comes out of that to pay employees at the BASE commission (not factoring in anyone who isn’t in the entry level position). It’s costs SFTS $2,500 to get into a school, so that’s about 21 schools that could’ve been funded. 

You’re taught psychological strategies to essentially mind fuck people into donating every penny you can get from them. Problem is the more you learn about it, the more you see the marketing firm doing exactly that to you. When asking questions they run you around and always bring it back to you - what you could be doing better, why your mindset is the problem etc. By the time the convo is over you’re left feeling like you’re fucking up, and don’t even realize you never got any answers until hours later. 

While Kirk the founder may only be paying himself 45k/year as one user mentioned (I haven’t fact checked that personally) the higher ups in these marketing companies are making six figures solely from this donation money.

"Depending on how much light your yard gets xeriscaping—low water gardening—is the best option. If you get lots of sun you can put in lots of little gardens packed with beautiful plants that only need a little water from a drip feed. It costs more up front but will save you a lot of money in the long run. Make sure to study up on xeriscaping and don’t just trust “drought resistant” plants from hardware stores.

If you want to grow grass you need to kill all the weeds with glyphosate (for some weeds this will only work in the spring when they’re just starting to grow), wait a few weeks for the glyphosate to break down, aerate the lawn, install sprinklers, spread compost, spread grass seed, spread more compost, and then water it every day for three months. Use an excessive amount of seed or birds will eat so much that you will have empty patches all over the place. Make sure to use a seed mix for our dry climate, most of the seed at hardware stores is bluegrass or fescue for places that it rains. Unfortunately grass seed for our climate is expensive. You can buy low water grass seed at McGuckin hardware. Mix clover seed into your grass seed, clover puts nitrogen into the soil so the grass grows better. And NEVER use weed and feed. It kills all the clover and beneficial underground bugs, which means you need to use more and more ever year. It can also kill your trees.

You can also try growing vegetables in raised beds with a drip feed. Tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers all do well here. Don’t plant any summer crops before mother’s day because a cold snap, and there usually is one, will kill them.",t2_ile9ot0g,Colorado-Sunshine,0,1648162172.0,0,t1_i1zrkie,i1zrkie,True,Fontanapink,t3_tn1xgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tn1xgh/hey_yall_moved_recently_to_boulder_into_this/,"Hey y'all.

"There are two things that you will need in quantity to make that yard more lush. I don't know which is of higher priority, but given how dry it is and with poor soil, you will not be surprised that you will need organic material, and water.

If you are composting at home, you're going to need a ton of compost and a lot of time. If your compost has only browns, you will also need greens (or vice versa). Composting is an art and science, and the inputs to your compost need to be voluminous and deliberate if they are going to have any impact at scale on that yard. 


If making compost for weeks and months is on a longer planning horizon than gardening this year: a good place to get organic material with which to build soil is Pioneer - don't get their planters mix, which is organic mixed with soil. I would just get organics alone, and let them infiltrate your natural soil. Don't waste your time going to Home Depot or mcguckin to buy bags of boutique dirt, since you need yards and yards of material (pioneer has a materials calculator). Rent a truck if you need to.

Next up, I would look at how you are going to irrigate that space. Mulch or other organic material will hold water from precipitation, but in between periods of rain, and even to starta garden in a box, you will need to water until plants are established.

None of this will be free or straightforward, and so I would think about amending and watering a section of that yard. Transforming the whole thing is a several hundred dollar (or more) endeavor, and water around here is not cheap.

Another poster is suggested tilling. I am an increasing fan of no-till to maintain structure of the soil (important), although the soil structure in such a hard pan backyard probably isn't worth preserving. That said, once you dig down past the first level of super depleted soil, there's probably not going to be some gold mine that you unearth.

Perhaps the staff was having a bad day, but they were cold and bordering on rude. I was instructed to not touch their scale in the lobby after weighing my dog upon checkin. After almost an hour waiting, my dog was brought into an exam room and left unattended and howling and everyone in the waiting room could hear. It was a terrible experience and I'll never go back.

I was shocked they wanted over $2k for a small .5"" laceration that would have taken maybe 3-5 stitches. In hindsight, it required no stitches to heal properly, only basic first aid.",t2_32fbc,jocamero,0,1648155024.0,0,t1_i1z9z9y,i1z9z9y,False,ElevatedGrape,t3_tmovn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tmovn4/can_someone_please_recommend_a_walk_inemergency/,Can someone please recommend a walk in/emergency veterinary clinic?

"The TLDR being, 

We are coming out of a lull in case

Cases are going up in Colorado

It is not currently dominated by BA.2, a new Omicron variant. 

The Faucinator and others believe the uptick will be closer to a surge as opposed to wave. 

&#x200B;

Throwing my opinion in there but it has been hard to figure out what I am comfortable and or uncomfortable with these days. I think I am at my peak I don't think about the pandemic mode since 2020. But what I am concerned about is that we have reached this new normal and we all have decided its no longer appropriate to have any masking or whatever. I now know people otherwise vaccinated and boosted incredibly active (Ultra marathoners) people now who got covid in the last 3 months who have had their activity levels significantly curtailed by a 'mild' case. 

I feel like we have jumped on the ""its over"" mentality without quite understanding what that fully means. We are never closing down again or going back to online classes I don't think and don't believe we should do that. But should we still be masking? I don't know. I still am.

(I picked up a half or full game each night I tried to play.)  From there, got dragged into a second team that was ""lower key"" (not really, worse skill but still competitive people).

">1) I don’t know that your dog is trained if I see it off lease. And at this point the over whelming majority of dogs I’ve seen off lease are *not* trained so playing the numbers I’m going to assume this dog coming up on a trail is capable of give me anything from a friendly wag of the trail - or biting unprovoked (yes the ladder has low probability but it’s still non 0).
  
  
100%!   
I'm not advocating for unleashed dogs. Quite the contrary. Most people do not have the time or energy to train a dog, and should I the very least be socialized and leashed trained.   
  
But a trained dog, you walking around a path or trail (most spots in cities have leash laws), would never encounter the dog. The dog, trained one, would never approach you or your dog for any reason.  
   
>2) Your dog is never 100% going to listen. It’s 99.99% at best. Those odds are good enough that with a bit of luck it will never be an issue. But take Boulder where we have 1000’s of dogs and suddenly it’s a probably game for when an accident is going to happen. You can’t tell me you’ve trained your dog to respond to you for *every* possible situation in a human environment. You’ve gone over *every* permutation of stimuli that Boulder can offer a dog to ensure in all of those situations your dog will respond. 
  
I disagree. But to a point.  
  
A properly trained one, not a police dog meant to attack, but one with positive training, and geared towards the dogs natural tendencies, 100% will. I am on dog number 3 (1 right now, had 2 through my 20s), and each has been diligently trained, and thoroughly tested in...and here is the key, the environment that my dogs and I mostly go to. In this case a trail/hiking/nature dog.   
  
But I can walk around boulder, around any one here, around any trail, bear, moose, cow, hell even emus, cars, trucks, construction equipment, etc. I can take her to the gym, go to bars, go to the zoo, go watch a dog show with front row seats...and yes, my dog will only ever listen to me, and never stray unless I give her the freedom command. I have tested this extensively, and in every permutation that I could come up with. Especially the wild animal part because of how much time I spend in the backcountry.  
  
I could see some abnormal behavior in situations we have never encountered together, like airplanes, or such. But I'm pretty confident even then her, habits at this point, would play more.  
  
And even after all that, she is still leashed in all public settings with people, merely for the stigma.    
  

>I wish more folks were like you and took the time to properly train there animals. That said, I’ve heard enough of the horror stories on other side of that 99.99% that even the best trained animal sometimes will not respond how you think they will and an injury will occur. It’s a numbers game - and better training just stacks the deck in your favor
  
Dogs are amazing, animal in general, and I think everyone should get the one that helps them the most in this hard life. It's a free friend. But it takes soooo mich more than people realize to train dogs properly, and most don't know you are never done. To this day, 4 years in, I still do lengthy stay and call command training with my dog. Soon to be another pup! Most people get to the point the dog starts responding well, and then say ""good enough"", and build confidence in that. And that's best case scenario.

"Fist of all - no one blamed you. Calm down and read my whole  post. To blame a leashed dog for attacking your dog because it was on a leash is not something any professional would mention as the catalyst of this situation. And yes, you could have gotten your dog away from them quicker… sorry not sorry.. that’s how leashes work… if there’s a dog running at you from 30 yards away, maybe you could have turned and gone a different way… not that you should have to do that, their dog was obviously uncontrolled and shouldn’t be out with whomever was walking them. Their dog is likely aggressive on or off leash and is obviously not controlled if it’s pulling it’s owner 30 yards aggressively toward you. They should have kept it off public property until they sought out professional training for both the dog and themselves. 

However- there are 10,000 people like you in the area that seem to think it’s always the other dogs fault and it couldn’t possibly have anything to do with your own animal. As someone who’s owned dogs my entire life (40 years), and have spent hundreds of hours bringing several animals to professional training. Every reactive situation is unique to the scenario, the dog, and the owner. I have raised several dogs. Had you read my other post on this thread, you would have seen that one of the dogs I raised (whom I loved and adored until we lost him to cancer at 11) was reactive towards other dogs after having been attacked by off leash dogs. I have broken up more dog fights then I’d wish anyone would have to. It’s horrific, sad, anxiety filled adrenaline rushed bullshit. No one wants that to happen. Your pup may be in the .001% of dogs that have a perfect recall 100% of the time, but if not, they should be leashed. Period. If not for your dogs safety, do it for common decency for other people. It’s public space that even (leash trained) dog aggressive dogs should be able to go to without the fear of there being an ugly situation. Even aggressive dogs should have the right a good walk without being subjected to other peoples animals running up on them... Also- There are dog parks everywhere.

"First off I completely agree that dogs should not be a hobby activity! Being a dog owner you are bringing home a new member of the family and that comes with responsibility I think most folks are not ready for.

Regardless of the owners readiness to take on responsibility that dogs life is better than sitting in an animal shelter with a count down clock on when it will be put down… folks just need part 2 of the equation to better their dogs life and that’s training 

> Genuine question so please answer 

Let’s not confuse intelligence with natural ability. 
- Intelligence is being able to respond to a situation using previous experience and reason to conclude the proper outcome
- Natural ability is a result from genetics and physical training that allows you to perform a physical task

A dog’s nose is orders of magnitudes more sensitive than a humans. That’s natural ability.

Being able to map a response pattern between smell-a-thing and alert owner is intelligence.

A 2 year old (or any human) doesn’t have the ability to smell gun power nearly as well as a dog but in the above example the intelligence factor is detect something with smell - tell owner. Simple pattern forming.

Can do the same pattern forming response with a 2 year old: this is round block - round block goes in round hole. Or “this is blue and this is red” - all just pattern mapping.

Dogs have no ability to understand *why* a pattern is formed. It’s simple dopamine reinforcement to reward an input.

> Dog’s don’t run from their owners because they’re unintelligent, they run because they don’t respect that their owner is in charge of them 

Yes if your dog understands that you are the alpha of the pack then it will obey you. Issue is that pecking order of alpha is can, at any time be put under question. If there is ever a situation where *you* don’t respond correctly your dog might, in that moment, not “respect you” and do something unpredictable.

You also can’t guarantee that your dog will respond correctly in every single situation based on what’s going on. You had to train your dog to smell gun power- did you train your pup what to do when their are squires on a hiking trail? B/c I’m guessing if you *didn’t* your in for a treat. 

Each situation needs training to build a pattern in the dogs mind. And in areas like trail heads, breweries, public parks the unpredictability of humans means you can’t train for all permutations and cannot guarantee a response. 

> Just because you have seen extreme ends doesn’t make you all knowing
- never said I was all knowing
- I just stated that owners who don’t put leases on in public places are dumb asses as by that simple action of leashing your can reduce the probability of an dog related accident occurring to 0. That seems like a good idea to me

> you look like a prick
- not nice

"I agree with you here that there are a lot of lazy owners (and owners who confuse training with tricks).

And for the 2% (making that number up) of folks who are diligent and go through the training their dogs are exceptionally well behaved.

Regardless of your training:

1) I don’t know that your dog is trained if I see it off lease. And at this point the over whelming majority of dogs I’ve seen off lease are *not* trained so playing the numbers I’m going to assume this dog coming up on a trail is capable of give me anything from a friendly wag of the trail - or biting unprovoked (yes the ladder has low probability but it’s still non 0).

2) Your dog is never 100% going to listen. It’s 99.99% at best. Those odds are good enough that with a bit of luck it will never be an issue. But take Boulder where we have 1000’s of dogs and suddenly it’s a probably game for when an accident is going to happen. You can’t tell me you’ve trained your dog to respond to you for *every* possible situation in a human environment. You’ve gone over *every* permutation of stimuli that Boulder can offer a dog to ensure in all of those situations your dog will respond. 

I wish more folks were like you and took the time to properly train there animals. That said, I’ve heard enough of the horror stories on other side of that 99.99% that even the best trained animal sometimes will not respond how you think they will and an injury will occur.

"Completely earnest recommendation - muzzle train her, and have her wear one on public trails where you're leash walking her! It's a pity that there's such a stigma around muzzles, because for a lot of insecure dogs they're actually such a good solution. There are tons of kinds of very gentle and permissive ones that aren't the kind people think of that keep the dog from opening its mouth (I'd maybe look into a basic basket one), where she can still sniff to her heart's content and get treats through it and won't even care that it's there any more then her collar or lead. Muzzle training resources are pretty easy to find online, and buying one is a lot cheaper than a trainer for an otherwise well-behaved dog who just needs that extra safety about snapping.

"My dog, that has since passed away, was reactive towards other dogs he didn’t know. He had been randomly attacked by other dogs in the past and wanted nothing to do with them for fear of being attacked again.

"You need to *control* your dog. I know I’m gonna get downvoted into oblivion for this, but… I had a dog for thirteen years. Yes we used leashes when I deemed it necessary. However when he was age 1-2 I worked at a doggy daycare where he was with me all day every day. He was *extremely* obedient. He did not chase anything besides tennis balls, ever, his entire life. No birds, no squirrels, no raccoons. He did not approach strangers unless invited by them to do so, and even then he would look to me for approval first. Same with strange dogs. The only time he was ever bitten by another dog was when that dog ran up to him from across a park, while he was within my arm’s reach (calmly walking at my side), and said dog nearly yanked their owner off their feet with the leash (dragging them physically across the park to do this). The attack was clearly a case of leash anxiety - “that dog is free and I’m not, he’s a threat to me.” The attacking dog was obviously the poorly trained/socialized/handled one in the situation. Unless I was throwing tennis balls for him or specifically encouraged him to go “run free,” my dog stayed within three feet of me when we were outside together, and that only happened when we were very much on our own.

What you need is to control your dog. For 99% of dog owners that means leashing. If you can *actually* train your fucking dog to act like it’s on a leash when it’s not (a lot of people who think they can, can’t), then you’re fine. Mind you, most dog owners in Boulder fall into the “can’t” category, so I totally agree that your average Boulder dog owner does need to use a leash.

"Generalizing that ALL dogs have the intelligence of a 2 year old human at best is pretty moronic. For instance, how many 2 year olds can alert you to the smell of gun powder on someone or something? Genuine question so please answer as my dog was trained to do just that and can do it pretty damn well. Dogs don’t run from their owners because they’re unintelligent, they run because they don’t respect that their owner is in charge of them. Just because you have seen extreme ends of the spectrum doesn’t make you all knowing and acting like it does makes you look like a prick. You have no clue what you’re talking about and you’re just ranting to rant. 

Spin it this way, my dog walks fine on or off a leash right on my side, however plenty of dogs ON A LEASH jerk their owner and snap at him solely because he is a bigger dog and the other dog isn’t trained well. How is that justifiable, if your dog is aggressive in any aspect, even leash reactive, it shouldn’t be in public until you train it to not be aggressive.

"So here’s an honest question. My dog and I just moved here last summer, and I’ve been trying to figure out proper etiquette here. My dog was 9 or 10 when I adopted her and had been abused/possibly used as a puppy mill dog before she came to me. She was so frightened when I brought her home that she would just stand there completely rigid and shake. I spent two weeks (of me at home with her) at the beginning just getting her used to me and able to walk on a leash at all. Potty breaks took 2 hours because I had to carefully coax her outside. She was terrified of doorways and would just freeze for a long time at them, and then of the porch deck, any sudden noise or movement on my part would make her skitter away in fear and set us back. She’s made a lot of progress since then and is a sweet and affectionate but still shy dog. She’s never shown any aggression at all towards humans, but to strange dogs who get in her face she’s snapped before. Never chasing after them, but baring her teeth and giving a snap of the jaws if they don’t back off. (She was also attacked in our neighborhood on a walk by a dog who broke out of its yard so that didn’t help things.) Now she does get along with other small adult dogs, she’s had several doggy friends since I’ve had her but her relationship with them is really peaceful apathy. They don’t bother her and she doesn’t bother them. 

I do my best to keep her away from other dogs she doesn’t know, and in my last state we could very easily walk trails and not be bothered. There were a lot of leash mandatory areas we could use too, and I would try to stick to them when I moved to a more dog friendly city in that state. We’d rarely come across unleashed dogs (usually who were off leash illegally), and as long at the leashed dog passing us ignores her (or even if the owner just makes sure the dog is far enough not to come in contact with us even if it’s straining and whining to get to her against its harness) she ignores it. She may stop and sniff the air after they’ve gone past but that is it. She doesn’t bark or pull or show interest in other dogs other than keeping one eye on them to know that they aren’t coming into her space. It’s really like she doesn’t have interest in other dogs but feels the need to defend herself if she feels threatened. 

But now in Boulder, I struggle to figure out where I can take her. She doesn’t walk fast and is scared of bicycles so I try to avoid the paved trails where we could be in a cyclists way. She’s old and doesn’t really need rugged trails to get her energy out (she gets pooped after just a half mile or so on an easy trail) so I try to stick to flatter trails, which means we’re not going deep into the mountains for a isolated trail. But then what’s left seems to all be leash optional trails with the voice and sight tag. Now I never walk my dog off leash, but I’m not sure what our etiquette should be on these trails. I feel like no matter what I do, I’m doing it wrong and I feel self conscious every time someone comes around the corner with another dog. I’m afraid their off leash dog is just going to run right up to her and get in her face trying to be friendly and she’s going to react to that sudden violation of her space with her teeth. As a result we don’t go on trails together often but that doesn’t seem fair to her either. When we do go, I try to stop in open areas when I see another dog coming and wait to see what it’s owner will do and communicate our needs (she’s sweet but shy, she’d rather not meet your dog), but I’ve definitely gotten side eye for that too. 

In our case “just train your dog better” is easier said than done. I’m proud of the massive amount progress she has made (I have actually put in a lot of time with her), but now it’s feeling insufficient and I don’t really have the spare cash at the moment for a special trainer (grad student), whereas when I did have the cash in the past this wasn’t an issue as we just followed our local rules and was able to avoid potential for conflict. I wouldn’t know who to go to either even if I could afford it, and the typical training articles don’t always work on her (she sits and comes well, but I’ve never been able to get her to lie down for example, and I’ve tried a bunch of things to get her interested in toys/play but with no success.) I think it’s because they are all geared toward more malleable puppies rather than jaded old dog ladies but I really don’t know. 

I guess I’m looking for advice. Am I wrong to take her on trails at all? But if that’s the case we’ll only be able to walk around the block in our neighborhood. Or does anyone have recommendations of quiet trails near town where we wouldn’t be in the way? Or leash required trails where we won’t be dodging cyclist traffic? Or maybe training tips for this particular situation? 

I really do try to be as responsible as possible, I just don’t know how to handle this new situation.

"I was in Nederland with my ~45lb dog outside the rock shop a few years back, and was admiring a pair of huge, gorgeous Akita a man was walking across the street. Literally as I was appreciatively staring, the larger male one's leather flat collar snapped and it bolted full-speed across the road and tackled my dog. My pup was screeching the most unholy noise imaginable, the owner followed but was clearly sort of in shock and was being sluggish to react. It's horrible, but I wasn't going to try and intervene - I knew a dog that large could easily seriously main or kill me if it redirected while in that excited a state, and that my dog would probably stand a better chance if I just dropped the leash to keep it out of his way and hoped for the best. 

Traffic had stopped, several people had rushed over to try and do something. The owner made it over finally and grabbed the akita around the middle, and a couple other people helped him wrestle it off and tie the leash he still had on it. He was horrified, and kept trying to apologize and explain that the collar broke even though he was still trying to contain the struggling dog. I told him I saw, I *saw,* but please just go - I was extremely frightened that it would get free again. 

We were incredibly, incredibly lucky - my dog had peed himself in fear and was shaking so hard he couldn't move, but otherwise had managed to get away with only very minor puncture wounds around his ears. His expansive neck fluff protected where the akita had been trying to bite him. Everyone who'd stopped to help was shocked I wasn't interested in pressing charges or trying to track the guy down, but I *watched* the collar snap - it's bizarre, but it can happen. I do hope he thought twice about bringing that dog out in public again, but I don't have any reason to think he knew it was an irresponsible choice not to have it muzzled or in sturdier gear at the time. I'll never leave my bear spray off my keyring again though, tell you that.",t2_4qkpx,aydengryphon,0,1648005145.0,0,t1_i1r14k9,i1r14k9,False,Cosmicmix,t3_tkftl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tkftl7/you_need_to_leash_your_dog/,You.

Any every time the owner says “He’s never do that before! He always listen when I call! I trust him and he always comes!”

Dumbasses. Everyone of them. Your dog has the mental intelligence of a 2 year old *at best* and can run faster than an Olympic athlete. No one in their right mind would *not* be holding the hand of a toddler while walking down the street - especially if that toddler has rocket shoes on.

Favorite story was when when my significant other came home 3 hours late from work. Emergency surgery. Dog owners came into the clinic: dad was holding the dog in his arms - mom was holding the dogs eye in plastic cup. Someone else’s dog attacked theirs while the families were passing on the sidewalk for an evening stroke - the attacking dog wasn’t on a leash. $5000 medical bill. Lost the eye.

If you trust your dog off lease in public it’s probably because you’ve been *lucky* - that’s it. Don’t believe me?

"I find this to be a tough debate because it’s definitely people abusing the rules and ruining it for those of us that have well trained dogs. I’m of the opinion that dogs are meant to run freely but in the correct setting. 

If you dog is not well-trained, that setting is solely the off leash dog parks. 

We spent a lot of time, effort, and money to train our dog properly. She comes immediately when called, never approaches other dogs or people unless given permission, and actually returns to my side when she sees another dog walking nearby. She will ‘point’ at wildlife but will not chase unless given a command to do so. Because of this and the fact that she’s a high energy dog, we rarely walk her on leash (she does always have an e-collar on). We do leash her in busy areas but mainly stick to less popular trails. I will also leash her immediately if someone asks me to but fortunately that doesn’t happen often.",t2_wukf3,lifeisspeeding,1,1648001477.0,0,t1_i1qtng9,i1qtng9,True,Cosmicmix,t3_tkftl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tkftl7/you_need_to_leash_your_dog/,You.

"I have a friend who never leashes her dog and takes him everywhere. I have to beg her to leash the dog when we're headed for a busy road. The dog is friendly, and *usually* comes when he's called but not all the time. Basically every time we go anywhere I'm cringing half the time because the dog is just running all over the place. Obviously I have talked with her about many many times and she just doesn't care. Her dog actually won't run in a busy road or anything like that, so it's not for his health that I worry. It's mainly the others with dogs who are not friendly and don't want another dog running up to them. But my friend's attitude is ""they should have socialized their dog,"" ""get a life."" LOL.

My 2 cents is that Boulder is very dog-friendly city but people need to learn to train their dogs properly or not have them at all. Almost ALL dogs can be trained, even the stupid ones. But it takes a lot of time and consistency. IF you get a dog you need to take off work for at least a week or two and be with that dog 24/7, your life should kinda revolve around getting the dog trained.

"That's true if you live in the City of Boulder, not greater Boulder County which also funds Open Space, plus already have your dog registered in the City's program, and have also attended the training course.

&#x200B;

You can pretend all you want that the program is not a fee grab but the fact remains that they do not test dogs obedience.

&#x200B;

As stated, it is a program to train the owners, not the dogs. And it costs quite a bit especially if you have a new dog.
