There's an album with the spots I frequent. There's also a couple waterfalls but I don't really remember how to get to them since someone else always took me. 

I'd advise talking to some of the other boaters for directions though, locals are pretty friendly and there's always people on Keowee. 

Some of the islands you'll see are suitable to pull up to or anchor off of, but I don't know which ones really. Check the SC DNR website for rules and regs about that though. I know camping isn't allowed on the islands but unless it's changed you can pull up to them and hang out all day.

Whether or not you're mad at a mod, there's nothing good that can come out of doxxing someone. You can shit on their ability to mod or whatever, but attacking them personally just isn't right. I know /u/jiandersonzer0 IRL as well and I know about some of the job-related things that were referenced in his and other user's comments. He's a good guy.

Now, with all of that being said...I don't agree with much of the modding myself either. I am of the opinion that as long as someone isn't being offensive, they should be able to voice their opinion as they see fit.

"Atheist here.   There are active humanist/atheist groups in the Upstate.   You should be ready for a generally religious crowd though.  First question I was asked when I moved to northern Greenville from Spartanburg was ""Have you chosen a church yet?""   Apparently said neighbor shared his shock privately, as a neighbor down the street told me she was thrilled to no longer be the biggest heathen on the block as a Pagan.  You'll get a lot of bless your heart type stuffs.  But generally no big deal.  Expect religious indoctrination to some degree in public schools.  If you run for political office as an atheist though ... that's when it gets nasty.  Asheville, NC is about as liberal as it gets socially in the Deep South.  It may as well be San Francisco Southeast.  And their open atheist city councilman had all kinds of threats and security details for being an atheist.

Regarding your politics GOD DAMMIT not another person who wants to keep the government out my bedroom (yay!) but help itself to ever bigger portions of my wallet (BOOOO!) and regulatory cost and burden on my business (BOOOOO!) to say nothing of the unlubricated sodomy I've gotten from ObamaCare sending my premiums and deductibles SKYROCKETING (more than 3x/5x respectively).   I should offer the caveat that I'm libertarian, and no fan of the GOP either.  I use to be behind the curtain of the SC GOP at the highest level through my last non-self-employed job ... and I carry with me now the burden of knowing just how our government works on both sides of the aisle in this state and nationally.   And no matter how screwed up you THINK it is ... I guarantee it's worse than you think.  Ugh.   Hopefully you'll understand my bitterness on this issue.

Speaking more generally about the state politics ... the Upstate is a stronghold for conservative politics.  The Democrats clean up the very poor, very rural, and very uneducated backwaters of the midlands of SC.  That's Jim Clyburn's district.  It's also where the term ""Sandlapper"" originates from, and home of the ""Corridor of Shame"" along I-95 where there's just desperate poverty and poor education.  The Democrats clean up on the few voters there and it doesn't matter because the far more populated areas of Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Aiken, West Columbia, Anderson-Greenville-Spartanburg-Gaffney (Upstate), and Rock Hill come in big time conservative and in huge numbers.   Here's the 2012 Presidential results by county showing what I'm on about:    https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/South_carolina_presidential_election_results_2012.svg/325px-South_carolina_presidential_election_results_2012.svg.png  

So there ya go.  It shouldn't be a problem, but not without caveats.  If you are looking for your South Park Safe Space where your views don't go unchallenged or countered ... then you shouldn't come here.   If you are tolerable of those in dissent with you, it shouldn't be an issue.  If you intend to run for public office though as an atheist ... don't do it here.  Seriously.  That's genuinely dangerous in most of the country, but even more so here.

"The Nantahala is pretty tame, but a good fun group outing.  The French Broad can be fun, but some sections have a lot of flat water to paddle with only a few sporadic Rapids to liven up the boredom.  The Chattooga can definitely be fun, but it can be a bit too popular, sometimes it can get crowded.  The Ocoee Is a little farther away, but it's about as advanced as you can get, there are numerous class III and IV rapids.   Hear the Green river can be fun, but I have never paddled it.

There is a kayak route on the Saluda river between Powdersville and Pelzer, but it is not very challenging.  There are a few ""rapids"", but they are minor enough that I call them crossing a contour line on the map.  On the other end of the spectrum, if there is a lot of rain the falls on the Reedy River in downtown Greenville become ""runnable"", granted they are considered a class V and I would not recommend that unless you are quite experienced (plus, I am not entirely sure of the legal status there).",t2_45mtq,meadhawg,0,1436919390.0,0,t1_ct3l4qe,ct3l4qe,True,ls48,t3_3d7x2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/UpstateSC/comments/3d7x2v/me_and_some_friends_are_looking_for_a_great_place/,Me and some friends are looking for a great place to go white water rafting around the area.

"As long as you're renting you can find many places very near downtown.  Don't rent anything located in the Dunean area, but the Overbrook area (near the intersection of Laurens and E. North St.) is really perfect for someone looking for your living situation.  Anything directly downtown costs a fortune but lots of houses for rent in the Overbrook area.  

I lived there for a bit, not anymore, but it's nice and quiet with lots of useful places nearby.  Also check out Bennett St, it has a little more of a downtown 'feel' but still with decent prices.

*There are 2 factions: Enlightened (green) and Resistance (blue)

*There are landmarks everywhere that can be captured and linked and fielded.

*When you find a portal on a landmark you hack it and it gives you items which you use to capture the portal or destroy enemy portals

"Anderson's nightlife is definitely starting to improve a good deal.  The biggest problem in my opinion is the lack of parking.  There are actually quite a few decent bars downtown.  For instance:

The Growler Haus is a pretty laid back bar serving craft beers.  12 different craft beers on tap which are constantly changed, go to their [webiste](www.growlerhaus.com) to see what they have currently.  Usually not too many people there, so a good place to hang out and talk with friends. No food though. Although they have a limited selection of beer, the majority of what they have is stuff that cannot usually be found in Anderson.

Summa Joe's is a restaurant featuring locally sourced seasonal ingredients and menu.  Has a good beer and wine selection.  Excellent food, but kind of a small place so it can get crowded.

Tavern Under the Bridge is your basic meat market bar.  Generally available beers and liquors.  Skews to a mid 20's agegroup who generally think they are cooler than they actualy are, but usually has a pretty good party atmosphere.

Mcgee's Irish Pub is hit and miss.  They always have Guinness, of course, but the owner can't always decide if he wants it to be a bar or a restaurant, so the food and crowd quality can vary.

The Fox has a pretty decent selection of beer, but the food is not that great.  It's decorated as a nice English Pub, but then there is a karaoke setup and digital projectors in the back.  It's kind of a mixed bag.

The Mellow Mushroom has a terrific selection of beer and great food, but can get pretty crowded on the weekends and is really more of a restaurant than a place to hang with friends, although I have seen people sit there for quite some time. 

Halfway to Havana is a cigar bar, but they are expensive and the owners are elitist pricks.  If you are not part of their clique they can be pretty unwelcoming at best, and often downright rude.  

Johnny Angels is a yuppie bar.  They have pretty generic food and alcohol selections but a good crowd, skews to the mid 30's desperate divorcee range.  Think of any upscale bar/restaurant you have seen in the movies.

Doolittle's is primarily a restaurant, but has a decent selection at the bar.  Sometimes skews a little older, but usually some interesting people to talk to.  Normally not too busy.

Uptown lounge has been there forever.  They are one of the few places that allows smoking inside, and you clothes will smell like it when you wake up the next morning because I don't know that there actually is any ventilation.  More of a working man's bar, the alcohol selection is pretty generic, but cheap, and they have pool, darts, and interactive trivia.

The Den is more of a latenight place.  It caters to the service industry after they leave their own jobs.  Pretty generic selection, but also pretty cheap.  Not bad to hang out in.

My personal favorite is the Growler Haus.  It is normally calm, they have good beer that is normally not available in the area, have a great cross section of patrons, attractive and friendly barstaff, and are a socially conscious and responsible business.  They give a lot back to the community and are helping to form a non-profit group called ""Pints for the People"" in cooperation with many of the other businesses and community leaders in the downtown area.",t2_45mtq,meadhawg,0,1357930428.0,0,t1_c7v64z1,c7v64z1,True,[deleted],t3_16ddvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UpstateSC/comments/16ddvs/anderson_night_life/,Anderson Night life?,/r/UpstateSC/comments/16ddvs/anderson_night_life/c7v64z1/,6,r/UpstateSC,0,6

"I don't usually post links, as you can see from my 56 link karma. Of course, don't feel bad about downvoting if you'd rather not see my cat-less karma-whore attempt on your front page. My life and perspective has change quite a bit in the past year, and reddit may have influenced a good bit of it, so I just felt the need to celebrate in some small way.

Today, I was hilariously surprised to find out that 20 states require you to pay taxes on your illegal drugs. If you don't, you can be charged with an extra fine and jail time. $3.50 per gram of weed, $200 per gram of controlled substances, and $40 per dose of a controlled substance that is not sold by weight. The penalty for not paying is ""200% of tax and up to $10k or 5 years prison or both."" 

The full bill for our state can be found [here](http://www.scstatehouse.gov/query.php?search=DOC&searchtext=leaf%25&category=LEGISLATION&session=0&conid=6821161&result_pos=30&keyval=1101237&numrows=10), and an abridged version can be found [here](http://norml.org/legal/item/south-carolina-tax-stamps?category_id=837).

"I'd recommend you stay wherever you're at or increase your budget.  Even with a roommate you're looking at (cut the bills in half assuming your roommate would pay the other half) $50 in power, $50 for cable/internet, $15 to 20 in water, apartments would include trash.  You'll probably need a phone too, so whatever you pay for that.  But just the three absolutely necessary bills to live you're available left for rent is $235.  The absolute cheapest I've seen in rent is $550 for a two bedroom (which didn't allow animals).  So you've got $10 left for if your power spikes one month.  Also have you thought about food, gas, entertainment, etc?  Now if you can pick up a second job waiting tables or something, it's a little more reasonable.
