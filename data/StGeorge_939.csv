The aforementioned asian store in st george has been closed for some time now so that's not an option. 

I've been here for almost 2 yrs bc of school and I've enjoyed the outdoors when I had the chance to do so. I feel relatively isolated from the general community because I live near school and only goto the gym,  costco, and occasionally to eat out and drink at 1 of only 3 bars in town. (Night life is non existent here. Last call is at fucking 1145 for fuck's sake). I haven't personally experienced any racism here as an asian, people are friendly. But I do get stares from time to time. But I feel like it's less so now as st george is getting more and more diverse. Couple times I've heard of people being rude to my friends were from people unhappy about newcomers in general, not neceassarily because of race, but who knows. AND it is trump country through and through (ralleys, parade, flags during elections) so I'm sure that'll be a change from WA.

We have couple mediocre sushi spots, a decent ramen shop, okay Indian restaurant, couple almost decent pho/thai restaurants, and apparently every white persons fav asian restaurant around here: sakura. The rumor is that someone is trying to open a korean bbq spot too in few months.

"That's all well and good, but for me, I'd rather cross the street and avoid most people than deal with an awkward smile or hand wave or whatever.  That could change from day to day depending on how anxious I'm feeling in the moment, though. There's a spectrum of what people do or do not want to deal with and how they deal with it. Just because you personally can give a little wave, doesn't mean others are ok with that. Everyone is going through their own stuff, they navigate the world through their own individual experiences, and what you may think is a slight is just some other person's way of dealing with life. Some people are legitimately scared of other people. Maybe they've had some sort of trauma and now they are hyper vigilant with making sure they are physically safe, whether or not you think they should be because of how YOU think you appear to be.

"I'm one of those people that will cross the street to avoid walking by someone.

Also, when I'm in a busier city and I can't avoid people walking on the street, I won't cross, but I will keep my eye on my surroundings and people who pass by or are walking behind me.

Also, as a woman (because women have been socially trained to be hyper aware of their surroundings and do things to preserve their safety while out in public that men wouldn't even think to do, because that's the world we live in), you never know who has nefarious intentions-- even if they dress nicely.

"I (34m) have lived in many cities & countries, but was raised in St. George and return often. Happy to answer any questions here - or feel free to message me.

St George area ...

\-Ideal spot for hiking and many outdoor sports

\-Snow Canyon State Park is underrated - truly picturesque, and practically right in the middle of town

\-Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, and other natural showstoppers are close-by

\-Desert wildlife spotting, birding, botany can be diverse and rewarding

\-Decent regional airport

\-Las Vegas with its shows, entertainments, international airport, shopping, etc. is just under two hours drive

\-The winters are mild, the summer is very hot indeed, and the rest of the year is temperate, dry, and sunny

\-Cultural activities are limited. There's a lot of amateur theatre - some good, some bad. Occasionally there will be a notable concert or stand-up comedian who pass through Tuacahn (a local amphitheater). There is a burgeoning film community, being led by FMASU and the Desertscape Film Festival, but for regular movie-going there are just two mediocre movie theatres - they are serviceable, not more.

\-Nearby Cedar City has a Tony Award-winning stage theatre and they're better than you'd expect for a small Utah location

\-Most restaurants are franchises and far from unique. A few quality places have started to change this. Namely: Onyx Cafe, Red Fort, and I can list off a few more, if requested

\-Dixie University has a dubious reputation for with political machinations

\-Much of the demographic is right-wing and Mormon Christianity is the predominate religion. Personally, I think it is pretty friendly place overall and it is growing rapidly. I won't dispute anyone's claims of discrimination, but in my own circles there have plenty of foreigners, church-goes, ""ex-Mormons,"" etc., and everyone gets along. There's a Native American reservation next door and a substantial Hispanic-expat community

\-A vehicle is mandatory; public transport is poor, and if someone saw you walking downtown, they would assume you're in trouble and need a ride

\-Low crime rate

\-There are two city pools and a couple community recreation centers. There are plenty of gyms, bike trails, parks, tennis courts, etc..

I don’t drink and my husband has had I think maybe 3 drinks in the last year? So while I’m not personally worried about the presence of alcohol I can see that the community reaction to it demonstrates a larger issue? Atypical world view? Not sure what to call it tbh.

The COVID response is disappointing as well. I’m about a month away from finishing my masters in public health so I definitely understand what it should have been.

Bar scene is pretty controversial. They opened a brewery and cocktail bar next to the pub and hotel bar, and now the city counsel members are afraid of a ""bar district"" and say melodramatic things like ""Is that where we are headed"" as if walkable entertainment will kill their daughters.

If you're not used to State owned liquor stores they're pretty hard to get used to. You can't get wine or strong beers in any grocery store, it's illegal. 

It's Trump country, with a weirdly high number of Qultists. The libraries get a lot of methheads, like most public spaces do, who believe all sorts of crazy Q conspiracies.

The Covid response here was pretty pitiful, lots of people very publicly talking about how they're proud of not helping others.

If you look at the growth of Washington County in the last decade, you will see the issue that is being had. Housing is an issue here, as in many places, but the demand is definitely outweighing the supply currently. Traffic sucks at the normal times of day, and there are intersections that you will always be stopped at. Chain stores have taken over and it seems like all the local shops are closing.

Anyway based on your other comments I’ve read of what you’re looking for weather and outdoor wise, it seems to fit the bill. Hiking everywhere, relatively easy access if you ever want a mountain adventure, close to Vegas if you want a weekend away, etc. A lot of people in a small area with limited places to build with hills and cliffs everywhere, and infrastructure seems to be a challenge for sure but some effort does seem to be made, even if it’s not matching the pace of the growth.

"There is definitely a strong Mormon culture here, and another commenter was right that it’s about 60-70%, but really it doesn’t ever effect my daily life and if you’re uninterested in the church and make it clear they’ll back off. They’re nice people and very professional in business. It’s absolutely beautiful here: lots of nice housing, hiking, parks, and the schools are decent (if you have kids). Dixie State University is here and a lot of retirement communities so theres a wide variety of different folks. Not to mention that there are fantastic medical professionals in the area, many with cutting edge tech. The nightlife is okay but there’s only a few bars (I recommend the station 2) but there’s plenty of clubs and organizations to join. If you come here you’ll grow to love pickle ball! Which is like a marriage between ping pong and tennis. It’s also a very safe area, although I come from the Bay Area of California so my idea of dangerous/safe might be different from yours. Keep in mind St George is in the Mojave desert, so expect the summers to be very hot.

"I've purchased there as a new resident in town - once. My experience was just OK but I am not interested in going back - I'll shop anywhere but there just because it has a very weird vibe. My purchase was around April last year. Went in, a very very nice sales young lady helped us and so politely answered our questions and just let us be while we looked around. I always have to think my purchases real well so I came back two weeks later ready to buy and I asked for the lovely sales girl only to find she had quit the day before. Apparently, it was due to customers being difficult to dealt with paired with the low inventory and slow shipping, at least that is what her collegue shared with us. I about walked out except I really liked the piece of furniture. They helped us order it, created an ""account"" and then told us once it arrived we had to pick up at their Hurricane wearhouse - kinda of a pain really but didn't want it shipped to my address. Had no problem accepting a cash payment. But I have noticed that if you purchase ANYTHING at any furniture store around here, they want you to create an ""account"" and provide all your data, even if you do not need it delivered - bizarre if you ask me. Sometimes I'd rather buy at a thrift store just to avoid the hassle of creating an ""account"". So, no, we were not asked to leave through the back door nor provide drivers license.

Sand hollow allows trucks up on their OHV trails as long as you’ve got a flag I believe. That sand gets way too many trucks stuck though. I usually play it safe up there. I’ve got 33” M/T as well. They do really well but the weight of the truck will work against you up hill. Get some good recovery gear if you don’t already have it. 

I’m more of a trail and rock crawling guy myself though so I mostly only go to the lake if I intend to swim.

I live near the city center, and 10-15 min in any direction will get me to a trail. Plus you are right next to AZ and CO. You’ll be a real explorer in not time!

I moved down here from NYC last spring and got me a Jeep Gladiator and way too many overlanding accessories for it. 

Put 12k miles on the truck since I bought it in July and have already earned me some good cowboy stripes and a couple Jeep badges of honor.

"Once the tech comes out to install it, they shouldn't have a problem using your modem (I used to work for them doing installs and tech support back when they were called Baja). If you want to be 100% sure you don't have an issue, just call and order it over the phone. That way you can give them a heads up that you'll be using your own modem. 

The only other advice would be to remember that the modems I linked to are just that, modems. You'll still also need a wireless router. If you hired me to install it and had a decent budget I would put in a Ubiquiti system, but those cost a few hundred $$$ (I think they're worth it but that's a whole different discussion). As far as consumer grade stuff goes, I would recommend something like this: [https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=28XBP4NN91X3B&keywords=Eero+6+router&qid=1645147794&sprefix=eero+6+router%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28XBP4NN91X3B&keywords=Eero+6+router&qid=1645147794&sprefix=eero+6+router%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-1) and you can add additional mesh units for extended coverage as you need them. They're WiFi 6 compatible and support WPA3 security. 

The sub-$100 wireless routers available are usually garbage and have incredibly weak security (most Netgear routers can be hacked in less than a second regardless of how strong your password is because of a WPS vulnerability), and we use WiFi so much in todays world that it's worth spending a little bit of money to do it right. There's nothing worse than a connection that randomly slows down, has bad coverage, and isn't secure.

"Yeah I had to fight them tooth and nail when I upgraded to the 1Gb plan and I didn't want to use their modem. They finally allowed customer owned modems and I switched ASAP. Now I'm on the 1.5 Gb plan and still using my own modem, so if someone tells you differently just ask to speak to someone else. 

With cable internet, modems are rated by their download and upload streams. So higher speeds typically require more down/up streams. The SB6183 is capable of 16x4 (16 downstreams, 4 upstreams) ([https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-Surfboard-SB6183-RB-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B01ERK1JLM/ref=sr\_1\_26?keywords=sb6190&qid=1645137795&s=electronics&sr=1-26](https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-Surfboard-SB6183-RB-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B01ERK1JLM/ref=sr_1_26?keywords=sb6190&qid=1645137795&s=electronics&sr=1-26)) and the SB6190 is a 32x8 (32 down, 8 up) ([https://www.amazon.com/ARRlS-Surfboard-Approved-Spectrum-Xfinity/dp/B088HHT41L/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=sb6190&qid=1645137795&s=electronics&sr=1-3](https://www.amazon.com/ARRlS-Surfboard-Approved-Spectrum-Xfinity/dp/B088HHT41L/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=sb6190&qid=1645137795&s=electronics&sr=1-3))

So if you're on a lower tier plan (100 Mbps) the SB6183 would be fine. You just need to double check with TDS as to what the stream requirements are for the plan you're on. If this is all just sounding like technical jargon, just order the SB6190 and you're guaranteed it will work. 

&#x200B;

When it comes to signing up, there should be an option for ""customer owned modem"". If you don't see it, just call them and order over the phone. Keep in mind that using your own modem only works if you're not bundling your internet with phone. If you're using their phone service you're going to HAVE to use their modem. Keep in mind that if you need phone and want to use your own modem, just go elsewhere for the phone service (aka don't bundle with TDS).

"For most areas TDS will be the fastest option (by a long ways). Infowest has been here since dial up days and is an awesome local company, but sadly their DSL/wireless speeds just don't compare to TDS. Centurylink's DSL is abysmally slow in most areas (I'm talking 10 Mbps), but they're putting fiber into some of the new developments (Desert Canyon by the airport for example) and retrofitting it into some of the older neighborhoods (they're installing it into The Knolls and some areas in Washington Fields as we speak). Go Fiber is another option but their service area is super limited. For your specific area I would just double check that Centurylink's fiber isn't available, and go with TDS. 

One little bit of advice if you go with TDS (I guess this applies to all ISP's though) is to buy your own modem. If you do a bundle deal and use them for VoIP, you'll have to use their modem, but if you're just getting internet from them you can get a great refurbished Surfboard modem from Amazon for \~$30.",t2_ciw7u,agrowland,0,1645128394.0,0,t1_hxcoq3d,hxcoq3d,True,Any-Lavishness3540,t3_surrcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stgeorge/comments/surrcg/who_is_the_best_internet_provider_in_st_george/,Who is the best internet provider in St. George?

A local black organizer was stalked by a cop for months after organizing protests. Despite complaints to the chief of police, they did nothing to put a stop to it.

"My mom is POC/Filipino and I don't recall her safety ever being compromised, there may have been minor instances of racial profiling but nothing that's threatened her. Her anxiety is through the roof though with the asian-hate news. 

I've lived here my whole life and as a half-asian I personally haven't experienced any threats to my safety, as I'm mostly white-passing, although I did still experience some stereotyping / bullying in highschool. There weren't many asians in my graduating class, but things may have changed since I've been in school.

"It seems pretty equivalent to my travel in Canada.  The further I get into a Canadian province, I am less likely to find a U.S. flag.  Beyond Waterton, possibly Banff I will likely not be able to find a U.S. flag.  

There may be certain places you can find it, but probably not worth your time to search.  If you can secure an address you will be near, you can deliver to it and pick it up on a specified day.  I have delivered to a hotel(not my residence) multiple times via Amazon or another service that provides a decent timeline.  

If you aren't a guest at a hotel you might be able to send it to a local post office where you can access it.  The pandemic has changed the accuracy in time in which some products are delivered though, so be aware of that.

I have loved time in Canada and hope I can visit again within the next year.  I hope you enjoy your time here and that you can see everything you want and have a great experience.

"If I could predict the market I'd be a billionaire, but there are a few things going for St. George that indicate it's in a good spot relative to other markets. 

1) Retirees will continue to flock here as homes in Salt Lake and other markets continue to rise to ridiculous prices.

2) Our proximity to California means we catch a lot of the demand as it moves east.

3) Families move here from Las Vegas.

4) The economy here is growing, with manufacturing coming to the east side of the county, more international traffic to the parks, vacation homes and short-term rentals going up near Hurricane, and the expansion of DSU into a polytech school.

The real question is finding a home, because there is zero inventory.

"> St. George is a lousy rental market. There are few choices and even fewer good choices. To me that makes renting less attractive if you think you will be here for any length of time.

I agree with you here.  However let's remember that city planning policy is what is driving this.

"A couple things to consider:

* St. George is a lousy rental market. There are few choices and even fewer good choices. To me that makes renting less attractive if you think you will be here for any length of time.
* The area is still growing and there is a shortage of housing overall. In the 2007 crash prices went down but it was driven by speculative purchases and bad loans. This time around more of the purchases have been cash deals and more are owner occupied (I don't have a source handy but that's what I've read). That suggests that prices are unlikely to drop much even if there is a correction. More likely prices will just level out.

I don't have any special insight into the market, though, so *caveat emptor*.",t2_1trp,russross,0,1644162964.0,0,t1_hvtnbsh,hvtnbsh,True,gucchella,t3_slnnor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stgeorge/comments/slnnor/to_buy_or_to_rent/,To buy or to rent?,/r/stgeorge/comments/slnnor/to_buy_or_to_rent/hvtnbsh/,3,r/stgeorge,0,3

"My wife and I are in the same boat! I would say there is never a better time than now to get in on home ownership, because there is no way to predict the market. To give you both sides of advice though, 

As someone else said: time in the market beats timing the market. Even if the market crashed right after you bought, it’ll go up again eventually and if you don’t sell you won’t be at a “loss”, long term ownership is a positive investment. 

Dave Ramsey says: Renting is buying one thing, time. Time to watch for an affordable option and reasonable circumstances. (But Dave also says that market is going to plateau)

"We moved to the area about 18 months ago (August 2020) and looked in all the areas mentioned. When we came to look we were 99% sure we wanted to be in Santa Clara or St. George proper. Budget wasn’t a concern, infact we didn’t know the price for most of the homes we looked at, which was intentional as we didn’t want that to sway our view. After looking at dozens of homes, we found an amazing brand new neighborhood in Hurricane out near Sand Hollow. Gorgeous views, nice and quiet, and our neighbors are amazing. We are absolutely not conservative, I wouldn’t say we’re liberal either, I’d just call us open minded and our neighbors are all largely the same way. It’s been nice. Our neighbors are mostly retired transplants (which worried us at first because we’re not near that age group at all) but we do have a handful of families that have lived in the area most their lives. 

Our son is from another country and I have to say we’ve had more race related incidents in St George and Santa Clara than we have in Hurricane. I’d like to chalk it up to it being the older generation you get way more of in St George and Santa Clara but we’ve seen it from all generations. That was one of our concerns when moving to the area, unfortunate but true. You do get a lot of Trump love in all of Southern Utah but certainly in Hurricane, in fact I bet a week doesn’t pass by that I still see a ‘Trump 2020’ flag still flying on someone’s truck. Again, we’re open minded and as such let them have their opinions and beliefs. 

As mentioned, the food scene in Hurricane (and really all of Southern Utah) is embarrassingly sad. I think there’s a huge opportunity for someone to do a good casual non-chain restaurant in Hurricane. There’s tons of tourists coming through all the time either from the non-stop events at Sand Hollow or those going to and from Zions and other parks and locals all seem to be wanting more.

I did/do find it a bit comical when talking to locals that have been here their whole life and talking about going in to St George. They all act like it’s a full day activity because it’s sooo far. It takes us no more than 20 mins, sometimes much less, to get to down town St George. At first I was confused how everyone didn’t want to go “all the way” in to St George. Coming from an area that had stores on every block and it still took at least 20 minutes to go anywhere, I found it entertaining. (I still get a chuckle any time someone talks about some place being “far”. )",t2_4iiif5cq,deleted_once,0,1642783152.0,0,t1_htm7xzt,htm7xzt,True,Historical-Walk-6327,t3_s6s6m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stgeorge/comments/s6s6m8/honest_local_thoughts_on_hurricane/,Honest local thoughts on Hurricane?,/r/stgeorge/comments/s6s6m8/honest_local_thoughts_on_hurricane/htm7xzt/,2,r/stgeorge,0,2
"Yeah those events for us were really necessary. We had just moved to St. George from Northern Utah and didn't know anyone, and leaving the church just totally left us not knowing anyone in the area and we didn't know how to make friends since we relied on the church before that. It was bizarre, but after about a year of going to the events on and off we just don't need it anymore. And now 4 years later we're essentially done with it.

"I live in Hurricane so I'll try to answer. 

>Just wondering, is Hurricane a good place for a family? Are the any restaurant opportunities or bars for my son to work in? Any good private schools? What is the culture of the town?

Yeah, I think it's probably great for a family. Low crime, lots of other families, good schools (or so I hear, I have no children). There are some restaurants in Hurricane, but not a lot. But St George isn't that far by car so he could commute. St George also has what few bars are in the area, unless you count the weird (usually empty) Eagles bar out here. Utah in general has weird alcohol laws and views, so if you're a drinker maybe look into that. Also our alcohol is weaker.

The culture is predominantly white and conservative although I can see it changing over time slowly. But liberals, leftist he'll even center people are probably the minority. We had lots of folks with lots of Trump flags making fools of themselves. 

>charging stations are sufficient for getting around southern Utah. 

I've seen one charging plug in all of Hurricane and it's a tiny thing in my apartment complex. If there are others I haven't noticed them. Walmart in Washington has some, and so do other businesses in STG. Springdale also has some, but that's up in front of Zion. I have no idea if that's enough for your needs, sorry. But short answer is that it's almost non existent out here. 

If you have any other questions feel free to ask. Despite everything I do love it out here.

La Verkin is basically the other half of Hurricane and its local government declared a ""UN Free Zone"" about 20 years ago (you can easily find old news articles about it).",t2_1trp,russross,0,1642525297.0,0,t1_ht74jno,ht74jno,True,Historical-Walk-6327,t3_s6s6m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stgeorge/comments/s6s6m8/honest_local_thoughts_on_hurricane/,Honest local thoughts on Hurricane?,/r/stgeorge/comments/s6s6m8/honest_local_thoughts_on_hurricane/ht74jno/,6,r/stgeorge,0,6

We have friends who don’t mind it though and like being around other students at the on campus apartments. Also we started looking for a place here in April 2020 but had to cancel that because of covid-19 so anything after April is probably a good bet. We moved that June though.

"Thanks. The important part of that is the unincorporated part, I believe. From the article:
>	The vast majority of vacation rentals within Washington County are located inside the cities, and only an estimated 60-plus exist in the unincorporated parts of the county the commission oversees. Of those short-term rentals, approximately half are licensed.

>	Licensed vacation rentals, even those now out of compliance as of Tuesday, are grandfather in under the amended code passed by the commission.

"Feel like I have to chime in here. I was in L.A. for 2 years prior to moving here. Lived here a year now. 36, work from home. Single. Music, magic, film, performing arts, etc. 

L.A. was of course easier to meet people. In the end for me, it turns out sort of the same though. I wind up with 2-3 friends top. This can be achieved here. 

Dating wise, of course St. George is more challenging than other areas, but I have not found it to be totally prohibitive or anything. Do consider this however, and this is just my experience: 

\- 30's somethings -  most people are mormons (not saying that's bad thing, but if you're not a Mormon - they're simply not going to be kicking it with you

\- the ones who aren't mormon often still are married, partnered, and/or have kids. nothing necessarily wrong with that either.

So now, your 30s something dating pool is: non mormon, non partnered single people. I can tell you, it's a small pool, compared to wherever you're from. But I simply don't agree that you can't find somebody here. I've done fine. Again, just my experience. 

And it is challenging to make friends as well, because of the same reasons listed above. But that doesn't mean that you can't make some. Just that it will be challenging. 

One day I'll write my whole take on St. George. For now, I've lived here a year and I don't have any plans to move.

"No.

St. George is the *worst* place I've ever lived to meet people.

The whole city is pretty much closed by 10 with a few exceptions. Absolutely zero nightlife; the only bar that serves liquor closes at 12. 

There's lots to do outdoors but those aren't great ways to meet people. No one wants to stop and chat with a random person while out for a hike. You can find hiking groups on Facebook or MeetMe, sure, but you can do that anywhere.

Dating apps are dead, and there's not a ton of options for actual dates because the only culture here is LDS history. *Hey girl you want to go have a wild night out at the Brigham Young house?*

There's no live music venues - your favorite band will never come here, or even that small indie band you like for that matter. The best you're gonna get is coffee shops, free concerts at the park, or artsy productions at Tuacahn.

If you’re not mormon, outdoorsy, retired or have a family of your own, it’s not the best place. Even if you like the outdoors, for like 5 months a year you can’t really do anything because you will bake.
For a city that size, traffic is pretty bad (especially near downtown and on any road that connects to it), it has a lot of great chain restaurants (but nearly no local ones), rent is expensive considering the average salary, and crime is very low (although definitely growing). Class sizes in schools are the biggest in the nation, DSU is a pretty good university for the price. Local government is a good ole boys club and religion plays a major factor in local politics.
I recommend it if you’re really big on the outdoors, you’re lds and have kids, or if you’re retired.
