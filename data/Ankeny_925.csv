"You need to back up to the understanding that ""wifi"" is not internet. Wifi isn't the service, just a radio broadcast of the wired service you're getting. You were provided a combo modem/router that interprets the source signal to usable internet (modem) and then creates a network for you to connect to (router). Wifi is internet service like a cordless phone is phone service. The cordless phone signal from the handset to the base is independent of the actual phone service.

So to troubleshoot the actual issue, you need to connect a computer to the modem/router with an ethernet cable and confirm your speeds and general reliability. If it's fine, then the issue isn't your internet service, it's the device's ability to broadcast wifi or maybe it's a range issue since that hasn't been clarified. Rather than try to work with Mediacom with their crappy equipment as long as the service itself is fine, you just need to add or replace the equipment. Either just stack a new router between the modem/router combo and you, and disable the combo's wifi network in favor of the new router (this is called double NAT which is fine for general users). Or you can completely replace the combo that you're probably renting for $10+/mo with an Arris Surfboard standalone modem for $100 that pays for itself within a year and then a separate router or even a new mesh wifi system if your issue is range.",t2_8ip6m,ranhalt,0,1638063362.0,0,t1_hmchi8k,hmchi8k,True,5507637,t3_r3pzqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ankeny/comments/r3pzqg/wifi/,Wifi,/r/ankeny/comments/r3pzqg/wifi/hmchi8k/,11,r/ankeny,0,11

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

And the point was more that the groceries were left in the grass in the rain. And even then, groceries have been delivered outside of the delivery time specified, whether it is sooner or later. And some people may be working from home. Some people may not be able to grab their groceries from certain places due to a decreased physical ability. Some people may want to give a cash tip in person after it has been delivered as they asked.

I guess I don't get why door dashers, who are providing a service to the people they are delivering to, wouldn't follow the directions the customer gives in order to avoid complaints that could get them blocked from deliveries from some companies, unless those companies aren't providing those specific instructions. 

Sorry that you are frustrated with that, but I also work in one of the grocery stores where I sometimes have to answer the calls of complaints when things aren't delivered correctly, and that's freaking annoying as well because other than blocking a problematic dasher, they don't really have to deal with the problems they didn't care enough to prevent.",t2_5v6s1671,Hate_usernames2,0,1623855807.0,0,t1_h1z48ag,h1z48ag,False,Hate_usernames2,t3_n85gfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ankeny/comments/n85gfe/i_appreciate_the_collaboration_between_several_of/,"I appreciate the collaboration between several of our grocery stores and Doordashers, but sometimes it's ridiculous when something like this happens...",/r/ankeny/comments/n85gfe/i_appreciate_the_collaboration_between_several_of/h1z48ag/,1,r/ankeny,0,1

I have an Arris SB6190 that I'm still able to get my new speeds on even though Mediacom said you'd need a DOCSIS 3.1 modem for it. So I bought a SB8200 and ended up not needing. I'd be willing to sell it for under retail. Never configured for my service, but I took it out of the box and probably don't have the box anymore. But it's never been powered on, has the modem and power adapter, which is all you need. I can throw in a coax and a couple Cat 6a network cables too. Retail is 150, I could part with it for 100. I can provide proof that I've got it and it powers on and prove that I know enough about this that I'm legit, but can't promise any take backs. Let me know and I'll give you my contact info.

"I opened two of them at the beginning of January all by myself.   It was just a matter of drafting the forms, signing them, and filing them with the appropriate fee.

With respect to expenses, consider QuickBooks or the like - there are a number of the on the web.  There's a small monthly fee but I think it can be deducted as a business expense.  Do be careful with your expenses - if you draw out cash, note it as a draw.  Keep receipts.  Best practice is to pay business bills directly from the business account, and to keep all of your personal stuff completely separate from business stuff.  You can pay yourself by making draws from the business account.  Writing yourself a check is a great way to record that.

If you're a sole owner, you might be able to do pass-through on your taxes, which means it's included on your personal return via Schedule C.  If you google ""Small Business Expenses"", there's a lot of really good info out there.  Contrary to what some new business owners believe, not everything is a deductible expense - that is likely where your friends got themselves into trouble.

"If you have a family or are starting one, I recommend the north side as everything you need is right at your fingertips. Same can be said for south side, but with the fast roads and longer walks it’s harder to let kids out of your sight in my experience. If you are a little younger and thinking more apartment/first house, south side is a little newer and will have a more modern feel to most of it. Houses on the north side are likely going to be a little bigger for a cheaper price, since they are a little older. I’ve noticed more yard space and parks north too, but I may be biased.

"Older, sure. Nice? Depends. But most basic apartments like on W 1st St near Christian Academy probably stay with someone or get passed down privately. I never see “apartments available”. Then again, you’re probably talking no amenities like laundry in the complex at all. Nearby laundromat. Maybe a shared building on site, coin op. But you probably have to make calls to hunt down availability.

Keep in mind that Ankeny didn't really have an apartment scene until the 1990s that took off into what you see now after 2010. There aren't many apartments as old as you're probably thinking.

"I’m a student and I’ve heard from a bunch of my other friends (which are in different states) about what their schools are doing, which is online school. What they planning on doing is online school for the entire first semester and then they’ll go on from there. If things look up, ideally students will get to go back to the school but if not, then they’ll continue doing online courses. As for measures, I think that schools should make everybody wear masks (maybe provide masks too? I think about this but then there is the cost). Hand sanitizer should be placed in classrooms too maybe. I’ve seen this in stores, and I use these “stations” frequently. For social distancing, I’ve no clue as to how schools will do this since the hallways aren’t even that wide; kids will crowd the halls just to get to lunch or their classes.

I do believe that parents will play a big role in this. They should totally educate their kids about the virus, especially the younger ones in elementary. The more we inform ourselves, the more effective we are in combating COVID-19. I hope my comment was understandable and I apologise if this seems disorganised.

"I understand that the battle between Mediacom and Centurylink is really a battle of the 2 evils. I can only speak to my experience. I have been with Mediacom since moving to my house in 2015, and the other apts in the Ankeny for years before. That said in the 5 years at this house I have had to have them out 3 times for issues at the pedestal or with the drop wire from the pedestal to the house. Other than the physical issues, I have had gigabit service for the last 3 years (I pay $145/mo, could get it for less but I have this fear of calling in to CS and someone screwing up my account LOL so I leave it be. my buddy across the street pays less for gigabit BUT has had MANY issues with Mediacom) and depending on the time of day I average anywhere between 600-950 Mbps (55-90 Megabytes) down and 50-100 Mbps (4.5-9.5 Megabytes) up, (there is a difference between Mb and MB lol, some are not aware of this still...)

Other than the 3 times I have called in for line issues my time with Mediacom has been uneventful over the years in contrast to my buddy across the street. My buddy across the street has been a fight to get his gigabit to actually get close to the full gig speed, Even though he is ahead of me in the loop and therefore should be getting same or better than I. He averages 300 Mbps or less, that is until the last time  when they finally resolved that issue, the only issue he has left is personal equip bottle necking his internal network infra in the house. 

Also I am not sure if it makes a difference but in my entire time with Mediacom I have ONLY subbed to their internet service, never once did I sub to their TV or Phone (they are scams as far as im concerned lol)",t2_g0plc,CamaroKris,0,1583843666.0,0,t1_fk3qqha,fk3qqha,True,pepdiz,t3_f67sas,https://www.reddit.com/r/ankeny/comments/f67sas/actual_decent_internet_service_providers/,Actual decent internet service providers?,/r/ankeny/comments/f67sas/actual_decent_internet_service_providers/fk3qqha/,1,r/ankeny,0,1

"I think I’m repeating what others have said but going to add my two cents anyway. The event itself was a great idea but the execution could have been better IMO. That could have been due to the unexpected turnout of humans. 
Good music / food and drinks available / nice venue, but my god we waited in a line for 20 minutes just to grab two 12oz cans of beer for $7 a pop, and by the time we were through that line we decided it wasn’t worth waiting that long for pizza. So we left after a couple of laps around and after listening to some music while finishing off our beer. Went somewhere else to eat. 
Maybe have the PD, volunteers, or even paid workers involved in traffic control and parking assistance because there was some parking and Pedestrian crossing confusion on the north side. 
More pizza.... if the lines weren’t that crazy we would have eaten there as was our plan. and for the love of god $7 for a goose island IPA is highway robbery. We were planning to grab a couple brewskies each and hangout but not for $28 plus food.

"I'm right there with you (on both counts). Sounds like we're getting an Irish Pub at the District, so I'm hoping they go for a laid back pub feel over ""just another loud bar but with an Irish theme"".

They divided it up with the bar on one end, tables in the middle, and then cozy booths that were designed to let in the ambiance and music just a bit, but still allow you to have a conversation or read. They eventually added a beer garden too, so there was a perfect area for everyone.

Ankeny is a nice place with low cost of living but there isn't that much going on there.

Ankeny is pretty conservative politically, but in my experience not in the hateful way you see in some places. The people I know in Ankeny tend conservative because they live in a bubble where conservative policies don't screw any of their friends over in any direct way and they do not witness the issues with them first hand. The churches I have been to in Ankeny have more of a motivational speaker vibe than the fire and brimstone attitude you might see elsewhere. 

Ankeny is an exurb, and the people there like to act like they live in the country and romanticize farm culture. If you go into any of the knick-knack shops uptown everything is either about sports or farms themed.

If you do not have a preference between the University of Iowa and Iowa State University you might want to choose one to be a fan of because people will definitely ask you. The rivalry is pretty intense, as there are no big league professional sports teams nearby but sports are a big part of the culture.",t2_7o8t1,theLoneliestAardvark,0,1525455611.0,0,t1_dyg6rv3,dyg6rv3,True,Hypersion1980,t3_8gvawd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ankeny/comments/8gvawd/moving_to_ankeny_iowa_from_santa_rosa_california/,"Moving to Ankeny, Iowa from Santa Rosa, California",/r/ankeny/comments/8gvawd/moving_to_ankeny_iowa_from_santa_rosa_california/dyg6rv3/,5,r/ankeny,0,5

"Welcome to the Midwest! I lived briefly in Santa Rosa once upon a time. 

You’ll be happy with Ankeny as far as crime/safety is concerned. It’s a fairly conservative town compared to other metro areas, but it’s trending Left as it is trending younger. 

There are some great new homes in the Prairie Trail area that sound like they’d be well in your price range. 

There are two good public school systems in ankeny: Centennial and Ankeny. I think Centennial is supposed to be slightly better, but people will argue that, I’m sure.  

It’s as nice a suburb town as I’ve ever been around and I’ve spent a lot of time in suburbs of major cities.

"Ankeny isn’t super dog friendly, but there are a few things I can think of off the top of my head. Firetrucker Brewery allows dogs on the patio and will bring water dishes and treats. Brown Dog Bakery does a “yappy hour” once per month, on Thursdays I think. They have beer and snacks for the humans and dog treats for the pups. I don’t have any dog walking suggestions, but Wags is an excellent place if you need doggie daycare or boarding. I love them. They also sponsor some events at the dog park during warmer months.

> Don&#039;t get me wrong, voting in the General Election is still very important, and if Bernie wins the Primary Election, you&#039;ll need to vote for him again on November 8th for the General Election, but in this particular instance, the Primary Election is even more important! If Bernie does not win the Democratic Primary Election, you can&#039;t vote for him in the General Election!

> Bernie already polls well against GOP candidates - even better than Hillary - but Hillary has the deck stacked in her favor, and the only way for a candidate like Bernie to win the primary is massive voter turnout.

> Bernie can win the General Election, but he needs to win the Primary first! Let&#039;s flood the ballots with our votes and elect Bernie Sanders as the 45th president of the United States of America!

"As it turns out, Bill wasn't such a bad guy after all. Their marriage was over long before he was president. However, while distracted by the Lewinsky scandal, Bill Clinton was manipulated into signing bank reform legislation which allowed banks to gamble with depositors' money. He also missed his chance to get Bin Laden. Had Hillary Clinton just been honest with the American people the financial crisis and 9-11 could have been avoided.
