"My son goes to Harmony, he was in an LISD middle school and the environment was just so toxic. If your kid plays sports or is in band, then they might be ok. Academics are hit or miss. Some good teachers, some bad teachers. 

At harmony kids seem a little bit kinder, they really focus on STEM, we have had way more teacher contact and are more aware of what's going on. When we happen to stop by the school things are a little chaotic, as with any middle school, but way better than the 1000+ LISD middle school.

"* If you're up for driving to the Domain area, we really enjoy [Sandbox VR](https://sandboxvr.com/austin/) for a date night.  We're wanting to try [Virtropolis VR](https://www.virtropolisvr.com/) in Round Rock, and there are several traditional escape rooms around the area as well.
* If you're into board games or RPGs, you might like [Vigilante Bar](https://vigilantebar.com/), which is actually in Austin.  You can get in on a D&D game at [Titan Moon Comics](https://www.titanmooncomics.com/blogs/titan-moon-comics-events/events/) in Cedar Park or journey to Austin to the larger [Dragon's Lair](https://www.dlair.net/austin/events/).
* The [Blue Starlite Drive In](https://www.bluestarlitedrivein.com/) is a fun date night.  We prefer the Round Rock location because the parking and access is more convenient than some of the others.
* We second [Pinballz](https://www.pinballzarcade.com/).  (Someone else mentioned [Bishop Cidercade Austin](https://www.cidercadeaustin.com/).  Haven't been there but definitely want to go!)
* Leander has a cute little area around Willis Street that features [The Thirsty Chicken](https://thethirstychicken.com/), a [Leander Beer Market](https://www.facebook.com/Leander-Beer-Market-331242267039178/), and [Maggie Mae's](http://maggiemaesaustin.com/).
* There are several food trucks around that are really good.  If you can find Casita Ruby on Nameless Road in Leander, you are in for a treat because the food is *amazing*.  I also really like [Aleidas](https://aleidas.com/), which is on old 183.  There's a beer garden, [The Good Lot](https://thegoodlotcp.com/beergarden/), which features four food trucks, near the Cedar Park Bark Park on New Hope.  Fun place for families and is a great place to meet friends.
* There are also several live theatres around this area.  [This site](https://www.austin-theater.com/) lists touring shows and bigger venues, while [this list](https://www.austintexas.org/austin-insider-blog/post/austin-theater-guide/) features smaller companies and venues.

"Drive just a bit to downtown Round Rock. Do the same for the square in Georgetown. Both have some great restaurants.

The weather is getting nice, go see the dinosaur tracks in Leander (it is a 10 min drive).

Go hang out at the Field House, or the Good Lot for just food trucks.

We have a number of breweries in the area, a few in Cedar Park.

Parks. There are parks everywhere here, most free, some paid. Hiking, swimming, lounging, whatever relaxes you.

The wife loves the occasional movie at Alamo Drafthouse.

If you are in the mood for a little drive (about 2 hours, but it is beautiful) you can hit up the wineries in Fredricksburg. Too far? Go to Dripping Springs for their wineries and/or breweries.

Also watch for events in Austin ""proper"". There is usually something going down; festivals, events, Eeyore's Birthday Party (next month, you have to go at least once).

"I just remembered [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CedarPark/comments/mk8vun/any_thoughts_on_the_upcoming_may_1_elections/) from the previous election that has more reasons why these candidates are terrible.

Some choice quotes:

* Collin Klein was a recent guest on The David Knight Show (longtime InfoWars host and conspiracy theorist, but recently fired by Alex Jones).
* Dorian's kick off speech video insinuates there was voter fraud in Williamson county in the last election.
* Dorian went around taking photos of houses with Biden signs and posted them on Facebook, along with another guy. That’s who he is.
* None of them showed up for the candidate forum to answer questions (I assume it will be the same this go around)
* Dorian supported Tim Kelly last year in the “leeches” scandal, and Claudia can be seen in a “Wednesday Wisdom with Conservative Women” video talking about how teachers and nurses “virtue signal” and aren’t heroes during the pandemic. 
* Well, Collin Klein is now engaging in arguments with people on NextDoor...

I'll reiterate, as awful as they are, both Tim Kelly and Dorian Chavez were previously voted onto city council in years with very low turn out.  They are hoping for low turn out because they know the fake culture war will motivate their base but not normal people.

"Tim Kelly is dumber than a box of rocks.  True story, [once in a council meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/CedarPark/comments/mwfjlb/cedar_park_councilor_tim_kelly_thinks_he_is/) where city staff was talking about street lighting color options, typically referred to as ""temperature"", he went off on why we were increasing the temperature of the lights thought he was owning libs but ended up with a massive self own instead. He was also [formally censured while on council for trolling/attacking citizens online](https://www.kxan.com/news/local/williamson-county/cedar-park-council-to-discuss-councilmans-online-comments-toward-teachers-in-special-meeting/) including calling teachers ""leeches"" (his misspelling).

The Chavez's, Dorian and Claudia, are both InfoWars/QAnon right wingers (including participating on InfoWars podcasts).  Fun fact, our current Governor Gregg Abbott is not far enough right for them so they are supporting further right candidates.  Dorian also was supportive of InfoWars outsiders bringing guns to our council meetings. They also are also waging a book banning culture war in LISD despite not having children attending schools here.

Colin Klein allegedly attended the Jan 6th insurrection. When asked about it on social media if he supported in insurrection he didn't deny it. Also a QAnon guy too.

"That makes me miss the California way of dealing with speed limits around schools, which is basically just ""go slow when children are present"", rather than Texas' ""good luck reading the signs with the tiny text we had to use to fit all the exact hours during which you must go slow"" approach, which would explicitly not require drivers to slow down during early dismissals.

"Hello,

It's definitely a suburban neighborhood! I feel very safe in Cedar Park. There are a lot of young families with children. I would imagine it may be a little boring for someone in their twenties, but you could always drive to the more livelier parts of Austin. If you're worried about being close to people your age or meeting friends, you may want to live closer to the city and make the commute to Cedar Park, but it will likely be a lot pricier the closer you are to the city.   


If you want to be closer to the city, The Domain area is midway between downtown and Cedar Park with lots of restaurants and shopping, but not sure how much rent is in that area.",t2_j7yhepvs,meereenee,0,1644543833.0,0,t1_hwg5dto,hwg5dto,True,[deleted],t3_spl5ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/CedarPark/comments/spl5ep/cedar_park_advice/,Cedar Park Advice,/r/CedarPark/comments/spl5ep/cedar_park_advice/hwg5dto/,4,r/CedarPark,0,4
Cedar Park is an excellent area in the burbs of Austin.  You're just outside of the city of Austin but close enough to commute in without much of a hassle.

"I was doing a little research on this as I bought a home in the neighborhood adjacent in anticipation. A portion of the land along the back of the tract that is slated to become this development was sold to the developers in January of 2019. That deed contained a restriction that stipulated the Grantee could not construct any improvements on the property until February 1, 2022. This tract is also situated such that a portion will likely be acquired for the New Hope extension between Sam Bass (CR175) and Ronald Reagan Blvd to avoid taking residential land to the north. The CAD map shows the likely path, but I don't see any recorded documents conveying the right of way from the Indigo developers or the  owners of the tract caddy-corner which will also be acquired from. The proposed Indigo Ridge Blvd from Whitestone to this new section of New Hope will bisect this tract. A new document filed January 25, 2022 shows a modification to the Promissory Note related to this tract. It modifies the maturity date to October 31, 2022. I am unsure if this also modifies the date at which construction can begin. I suspect the first stages of work on the Indigo Ridge development will begin as the New Hope extension begins as utility infrastructure and internal roads will will integrate with the New Hope project. And, I further speculate that this work cannot begin until the City secures the ROW for the New Hope Extension, at which time we will see a recorded with the County Clerk.

"I don't disagree.  But not every tract is suitable for high density residential and I would argue this is one of the unsuitable tracts.  Watching the old Oct meeting, the developer's representative even talks about how the site is restricting them from meeting all the zoning requirements.  So even if this gets approved they won't be able to build what is required by zoning and it will start off sub-standard.  My guess is this piece of land is cheaper due to it's location, weird shape and current zoning so they figure it is more cost effective to put effort into getting the zoning changed rather than build on land tracts that are currently designated high or med density residential.

You could do pretty much anything short of an 18 wheeler back then school busses included with a chauffer's license.  I drove so much I developed kind of a 6th sense about being in traffic.  I had sit and watched a couple of things happen that I knew would happen.  Nothing bad but might have been had I proceeded.  I kind of blew it off over the years even questioning my memory and circumstances.  But it had happened twice.  I wasn't a believer but I was aware.

Then last year.  A load started breaking loose on a rig I was beside.  Could have knocked me off the road but I was already in action before it got started.  Watched it all from a safe distance behind and a little to the right.

"My wife and I had dinner with a friend at Lucy’s Fried Chicken restaurant in Cedar Park on Friday evening.  I had been curious about the restaurant because I am a BIG FAN of fried chicken.  Fried chicken is probably my top three favorite meal.  
The restaurant itself is very nice, open space, picnic style bench tables and regular dining tables. The ambiance is nice; posters of Texas based musical acts and assorted Texana items decorate the restaurant.  
The food!  I had “The Basket”, a four piece order of fried chicken. Something to consider when ordering, sides are only with specific dishes.  My wife had the chicken and waffles, substituting the piece chicken with tenders.  Our friend had the staple item of many covered dish potluck dinners; chicken spaghetti.  As an appetizer we ordered the fried deviled eggs. 
The fried deviled eggs were good, not quite a Scotch Egg, but it came with a dipping sauce that was similar to a comeback sauce. 
The chicken basket I had was good, large pieces of crispy fried chicken that was juicy, I wanted a little more spice, but that’s why they have different hot sauces available on the table. 
The chicken and waffles were very good.  The waffles came with a honey butter that was delicious. The tenders were just as crispy and juicy as the piece chicken. 
The chicken spaghetti was loaded with chunks of pulled fried chicken and cheddar cheese and came garnished with a fried chicken wing.  Our friend enjoyed the spaghetti very much. 
I plan on returning to Lucy’s in the future, there are many other dishes served; fried fish, oysters, and the bar has a wide selection of spirits.",t2_56uzawak,James_Tx1967,0,1642996543.0,0,t1_htz5kpy,htz5kpy,True,James_Tx1967,t3_sbcn6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CedarPark/comments/sbcn6x/lucys_fried_chicken/,Lucy’s Fried Chicken!,/r/CedarPark/comments/sbcn6x/lucys_fried_chicken/htz5kpy/,10,r/CedarPark,0,10

"Yep.

A friend worked at J&Js BBQ on Whitestone. It was minimum wage, and I commented, ""do they pool the tips?"" Nope, the owner kept 100% of the tips for herself. Fawk!

I skip uber eats (too many orders charged for but never delivered).

Door Dash - Brooklin Heights Pizza night for College game. My wife is the 'Bama fan. I tipped the driver $20.  We order out once a month, and I feel sorry for drivers who get stiffed $6.   $20 is reasonable to save my sorry ass from picking up the pizza. We only do that once a month (Pizza, wings, and tip were $68.  I can only afford that one a month, but it makes up for PB&J nights).   Great pizza, great game, the wife was pissed. Georgia earned that one!

I do tip the jar when pickup food. 20% is part of staff wages, so don't be a cheapskate and say ""the mgt should pay them."" Eat out less, tip well.   

My kids worked in local places during high school days.  Most of the businesses since closed but had more insight ten years ago.

So Pickleball at the Rec Center is Monday-Saturday from 8am-12pm.  Bring your own racket and its open play. They have 6 courts and when you show up you just place your paddle on a stack where everyone is placing their paddles.  Every stack has 4 players and when a court opens up you grab your paddle and you play with those players.  After 11 points you go back and put your racket back down at the end of the line to play again. If you are new we are all friendly and will show you the ropes and where to go and explain the rules if you need it.  Their is a wide variety of skill levels and we can usually pair you off with newer players.,t2_8c70q,BladezLight,0,1641968085.0,0,t1_hsbfepd,hsbfepd,False,AEqualsNotA,t3_s1ktwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CedarPark/comments/s1ktwf/pickleball/,Pickleball?,/r/CedarPark/comments/s1ktwf/pickleball/hsbfepd/,2,r/CedarPark,0,2
"It will always slow down during the fall to winter because that's when most families don't want to think about moving during the holidays and seasons. Good for buyers not seller.

Things will spring back like they always do in the spring and summer.

Best city, Lake Travis is amazing for social distancing , food is amazing and people are the nicest. Still remember it brand new to us, driving through neighborhoods and families walking and waving at every turn. They didn't care who we were or what we were doing. Just plain friendly. Maybe not all TX but Austin's attitude and feel is spreading.

"Yes, Active Transportation Advocates Cedar Park has been working toward better infrastructure for biking, walking, running and rolling for over a year.  It was a great year!

I've been meaning to finalize and post the 2022 goals, which starts with telling the Council we like the bond package. There is trails funding in both Transportation and Parks sections (linked below) - a lot more than the prior bond package had. Email Council@cedarparktexas.gov

[https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/16916/637703475918800000](https://www.cedarparktexas.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/16916/637703475918800000)

One of the connections listed in the bond package is to connect from the 183A trail somewhere around Brushy Creek over to the new Bell District. Probably the best route is along the Cap Metro rail line - a group in Austin has been successful getting trail segments in the Cap Metro right of way. 

Have a look at our connection opportunities page, let me know if there are more we should add:  [https://www.wyld.net/atacp/connection-opportunities/](https://www.wyld.net/atacp/connection-opportunities/)

We're seeing a lot of success by getting involved in the process early - we talked to council candidates plus city boards and the bond task force.  

The PACE (Parks, Arts and Community Enrichment) board has been receptive to the proposed Cedar Park Wildflower Trail, though just the part which is already designated as park/trail. Additional segments should be addressed in the upcoming Master Plan rewrite - we need people to volunteer to be on that task force when it happens.

"So just to help out a bit with your paychecks your looking at qualifying $895-$1075 in rent depending on if they do 3x rent or 2.5x rent. 3 times is more common in my experience but the 2.5 places exist! 

Is the $66k liquid? If it’s in a savings account and consistent for 90-180 days you can use that as a proof of income instead of your job. With that your qualify between $1830-2200. Usually to qualify with savings they’ll take rentX2.5-3Xnumber of months in the lease (ie $1000 in rent needs $36k in savings for a 12 month lease with a 3x the rent requirement).

"I use four different sites so I can look at seven different weather forecasts. Links at the bottom of the post.

Devine Lake Park is actually pretty terrible for kite flying. I'll go there for the kite festival they hold each year, but wind is always bad. The space is small, it's ringed by trees which break up the wind, both reducing the speed and causing turbulence which makes kiting difficult.  It is rather far north for me, as I'm down close to Lakeline Mall.

I take the roughly 30 minute drive east to Old Settlers Park. Although they keep making kiting harder by ringing fields with fences and boxing in fields with trees, there some good spots. [I usually fly at the point marked on this map](https://centraltexaskitefliers.com/). Since our wind is typically from the south, that spot gives a roughly half mile run that isn't broken up. (A better spot used to be just north of those, before they put the tennis courts and more trees in.)  Our winds also like to blow from the northeast sometimes, and that's when the cricket grounds are a better choice, but I always yield to cricket players.

-----

The sites I use are:

National Weather Service: Start with [this](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lon=-97.69890126118506&lat=30.49454999904532) to adjust the spot, then scroll down to the hourly forecast so you get [this](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=30.4945&lon=-97.6989&unit=0&lg=english&FcstType=graphical). That's the good forecast based on combining the NAM, NEMS, and NMMB models, plus their own secret sauce. While it is accurate it tends to be slightly high on wind numbers.

Windy.com: [Their wind forecast and regional map](https://www.windy.com/30.541/-97.627/wind?30.468,-97.627,11) shows 5 different forecast models (NAM, Meteoblue, Icon, GFS, and ECMWF) each with a wind range of average and gusts. The difference between the various forecasts is useful, when they all agree on the forecast four days out it is likely to be exact, the more they disagree the less the forecast can be trusted.

Windfinder.com: [Good detailed forecasts](https://www.windfinder.com/weatherforecast/old_settlers_park) as they have an actual weather station at the park. It tends to be the most accurate for wind levels.

WillyWeather's [UV Index](https://uv.willyweather.com/tx/travis-county/austin.html) gives a good idea of UV protection I'll need.  3-6 means sunscreen for me applied during peak hours; over 6 means UV gloves, UV head wrap, UVA/B sunglasses, and good hat; over 9 means all of it plus sunscreen reapplied every 90 minutes; over 11 means re-apply at least every hour.",t2_fj9rl,rabid_briefcase,0,1639685290.0,0,t1_hotn30j,hotn30j,False,krazyhorsegurl33,t3_rhfyrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CedarPark/comments/rhfyrm/is_it_always_this_windy_here/,Is it always this windy here?,/r/CedarPark/comments/rhfyrm/is_it_always_this_windy_here/hotn30j/,4,r/CedarPark,0,4

"Alright I completely agree. I just had one question about this though. Whenever Greg and his lawyer called adult friend finder and asked them if any of the usernames the ranger found were real accounts I was confused. 1. They asked if they were accounts open at that present time (I think), obviously he would have long deleted them.

The other thing is when they showed the presumably false usernames/emails they weren't the ones that the ranger found. They were all spelled differently. It was weird. They were like regkelley3 as apposed to GregKelley3, all were missing a G except for the last one at that one was also different it was like a different number. 

Was this deliberate to mislead the viewer. At first I thought maybe the G was blurred out for privacy reasons like they did to the @______ part.

If you need a loan, open an account with UFCU and/or RBFCU beforehand and see if you can pre-qualify for the car loan. These are the highest recommended credit unions in the area and usually have the best rates But if you have time, check out rates from all the credit unions. A pre-approved loan saves time at closing and the chance of dirty finance tricks. With some banks/credit unions, the pre-approved loan transferred to the dealer electronically with a few emails or codes; no more getting a physical check and it being valid for only one specific car with a specific price and all that jazz.

"It's exciting to have such a positive reception!

Right now is a great opportunity to influence how Cedar Park is built out over the next 5-7 years. There is a Bond Task Force putting together a package of projects - expected to total well over $100M.

They are expected to finalize the package within 2 weeks, and you can tell them what's important to you - whether it's a pedestrian crossing across Cypress Creek, or finishing the 183A trail to connect us to Austin, or more sidewalks in your neighborhood - or just a general ""better trails for walking and biking"". 

We've been talking to the task force for weeks, but it's critical to have as many voices as possible asking for better active transportation in Cedar Park.

**Please take 5 minutes right now and email** [**BondTaskForce@cedarparktexas.gov**](mailto:BondTaskForce@cedarparktexas.gov) 

If you're feeling motivated, it would be great to also directly contact the Council, as they will do the actual approval of the package: [council@cedarparktexas.gov](mailto:council@cedarparktexas.gov)

"Absolutely!

There has been an ongoing sidewalk gap project - email [engineering@cedarparktexas.gov](mailto:engineering@cedarparktexas.gov) and ask to be put on the list.

I really appreciate that Cedar Park has been trying do these gap closures for something like 10 years. Usability has been.... variable. We really want them to use safe, highly user friendly designs for all new construction or reconstruction. User friendly for all ages and abilities, not just for the road warrior bikers in spandex.

"Dealers often sub it out.

They use 3M window tint (which held up great)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These guys are also good (dealer subcontracted with them).

I suspect dealer spec'd ""cheapest material"" (more profit), but the tint was fine after five years (Nissan - traded it).

[http://www.thebestwindowtintshop.com/wp/](http://www.thebestwindowtintshop.com/wp/)

I had my old '84 FJ60 LandCruiser for over 30 years, 3M window tint.   I should have never sold it. Hence why I recommend 3M window tint.

I like the second row back being dark as possible, drivers and passenger tints being lighter ""Texas Legal.""

Shades of Texas. They did ours in 2009 and it still looks perfect on a car which isn't garaged. We did get the midgrade 3M film.
