"Buddy, i hate to tell you. 

But this is a fairly insensitive post, you need to not make judgements on people before you understand their culture and religion as well as they do. 

This is clearly coming from a place of subconscious prejudice, otherwise you wouldnt have made this post at all. I hope at least, or you just are racist

I really reccomend you delete this post and educate yourself by watching videos on the buddhist religion, and the taiwanese culture. And make sure to watch more than one video, and wikipedia articles can be helpful too.  

But definitely dont do what you did here

"Summerside:

* Brothers 2 - family/pub style, good fish and chips, nothing you couldn't get in AB but alright.

* Arigato - probably the best sushi on the Island. My wife is from Vancouver and says it stacks up against West coast stuff, the people who run it formerly ran a restaurant there. Again, probably nothing you couldn't get in Calgary, but it's good.

* South Central - Good sandwiches/lunch

* Sissy's Kitchen in the mall - sleeper place, super good Vietnamese food and really really sweet people who run it.

* Evermoore - 'gastropub' kind of place, good food, don't go for the beer.

* Island Stone (Kensington) - another gastropub, good food and a nice atmosphere

* CKB Cafe (Kensington) - new and really good coffee and brunch, definitely worth a trip.

Charlottetown: 

* Churchill Arms - really good pub style curry, good atmosphere.

* Himalayan - North Indian food, super good, great folks who run it.

* Slaymaker & Nichols - small plate/bite style food, had some good experience but haven't been for over a year so not sure what the scoop is now.

* Cedar's - Lebanese food, go and get the chicken schwarma, some baklava and Lebanese coffee.

* El Sabor - authentic Mexican food, only available on Saturdays at the Ch'town farmers market

* Spicy Chef - some good items, I think run by the Himalayan folks.

* Point Prim Chowder House - worth a trip if you want something with a nice view, may not be open when you're here.

"There are two groups on the Island now divided by gender. There is GEBIS which is the Monks and there is GWBS which are the Nuns. The Nuns are just outside Brudenell and the Monks are in little Sands. It's basically a religious boarding school. If you wanted to join them you apply and then give up your worldly possessions and start studying The Five Great Treatises. Which are the holly books of Tibetan Buddhism. If I remember correctly from their open house they basically need to memorize these texts and it can take over 7 years to finish their studies. Now as far as the language issue I think the problem is that we are viewing them as ""immigrants"" who are looking to start a life here which isn't really the case. They come here to study Buddhism and live an isolated life with no intention of integration into society at large. Now there are some valid criticisms (land use, the age of some of the students, families of members moving to the area and driving up house prices) and they are definitely a little culty but at the end of the day they are Buddhists trying to live an isolated life of peace and really aren't harming anyone.

"Please tell me why our politicians and decision makers are still fear mongering covid when hospitalizations and deaths are plummeting because 84% of people are vaccinated? I bet you can’t cuz you don’t understand epidemiology beyond what your spoon fed. New variants aren’t caused by people not getting the vaccine??? Viruses are always evolving in order to combat the immune system of its host. Not only that but these variations aren’t even created in North America where a large majority are vaccinated and have been vaccinated for a while now. We’ve known since day one masks and lockdowns don’t stop the spread of covid. China follows a “0 covid policy” which continually infringes on the rights of their people for the sake of controlling covid. And to what success? None. They still have to lie and conceal there true numbers. So why are our leadings looking to china as a shining example? Because it’s a kickass way to consolidate power and pump money into spaces we don’t need it to go. You look at things 2 dimensional. But with any kind of critical thinking you’d see the pandemic and it’s mandates for what they rlly are. Scientifically baseless procedures which have caused more harm and damage to our people and economy then if we just let covid go wild. So if you wanna “follow the fucking science” be my guess but do not attempt to bring people down with you. Hell the chief medical advisor for the United States didn’t even believe in masks before the pandemic💀 and when we was asked about his change of heart all he gave was some half asses excuse along the lines of “I didn’t wanna inform our people about the benefits of n95 masks so our medical system wouldn’t be short stocked” and he only gives quick and short answers to why he never condemned cloth masks until the media started pointing out their ineffectiveness. The fact we’re pushing for a fourth covid dose while less the 10% of the worlds poor have even had there first dose is absurd. if as you say covid Variants are caused by people not being vaccinated soon enough then it’s crazy that our government doesn’t send vaccines to these poorer countries cuz in return we’d lower the risk for new, reinfectious  variants which would further improve our situation.

"This is incorrect.

Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) detect antigens, not antibodies. In the case of the COVID RATs, the antigens are specific proteins on the surface of the virus. An antigen test reveals if a person is currently infected with the virus. Once the infection has gone, the antigen disappears, and you’ll test negative on a RAT.

Antibody tests are not usually used to diagnose current infection as it takes the body some time to produce antibodies. Antibodies (immunoglobins) are Y-shaped proteins produced by the immune system in response to exposure to antigens.

PCR tests detect the presence of genetic material from the virus. The test could also detect fragments of the virus even after you are no longer infected. That’s why public health tells you that you don’t need a PCR test for up to 90 days post COVID infection.

I have no fucking idea why PEIPH is recommending avoiding RAT tests for up to 90 days post infection. Afaik, once the infection runs its course, you should test negative. Still hunting for that info. My (purely speculative) guess is that the risk of reinfection within 3 months appears lower than the risk of people misunderstanding public health protocols, so they went with the simple “no testing at all” protocol? Maybe they’re trying to save RATs bc reinfection risk within 90 days is low? Idk.

(Edit: This study out of Alaska explored the idea of using a negative RAT as an indicator for when isolation should end after infection. So the 90 day thing for RATs makes no sense.

">Apparently I’m misinformed about my life, and I’m pretty sure my phone number started with 416.

First things first, there is zero need to get defensive. Secondly, I never said you were ""misinformed about your life"" 
 but I'm going to further breakdown why I disagree on each of your points (hint: a lot of it comes down to *choice* and *options*).

>If I lived in a more vibrant neighborhood with more restaurant choices, like closer to downtown, then meals would have probably gotten cheaper. 

Well as someone who has lived in the following neighbourhoods:

1. Jane/Finch
2. Chinatown
3. Baldwin Village
4. Woodbines Gardens
5. Etobcoke by the airport

I don't know what you are talking about here. Half of those are not even close to downtown, and on that note, I actually find that eating out is cheaper the further from downtown you go; at least until you hit the suburbs. 

Like I'm sorry, I'm not saying you don't find it expensive, but I do think that the reason you do is because you either have a warped interpretation of what ""expensive"" means in terms of going out to eat, or you were somehow picking exlusively overpriced restaurants. I work in an office for a Toronto based company where there are many of our staff that are GTA transplants, and one thing they all agree with me on is that eating out is on average anywhere from 10-20% more expensive. So this is either you making terrible dine-out choices, or you're being Adishonest. A literal quick Google search of GTa restaurant menu prices will prove this.

>Plus more walking instead of transit/parking/delivery fees would have been great.

Again I only had a car for about a year of my near 10 of living in the city. I literally got rid of it because it was almost always quicker and cheaper to take transit, and when transit couldn't fit my needs, zipcar and uber filled the gap easily, and I was still paying less per year than I would owning a car even here on the island. Short of having kids (eventhen, many families pull it off just fine) or a job that requires a car (delivery driving, on-site sales/service, etc.) having a car in Toronto is in no way, shape, or form a requirement and is nothing short of a status symbol, convenience *choice*, or required due to a mobility issue. Did you need a car, or did you want one? 

>For parking, what really blew up my budget was the cost to park at the building I lived in. As far as I could tell this is common in the 416. Its not common in Charlottetown. Those couple hundred per month add up.

See above. Owning a car here is essential. Having one in Toronto is predominatly not. 

>So Toronto cost at least $3k more per year to have a car which if I stayed in TO long enough might have been given up, but that wasn’t the case.

So again, a choice. You *chose* to have your car because of ""time"" or some shit, which I'm sorry makes no sense to me. All this comment tells me is that you lived in Toronto for like a year and without learning a single fucking thing about life there, decided it was too expensive because you came in expecting things to be a direct correlation with life on the island. You need to make adjustments when you move dude, regardless of where you move to, but especially when it's from somewhere small to somewhere big. 

This is clearly a case of someone who expected to move to the big city and have everything just work out without any effort on their part to learn how to adjust to their new environment. Your experience is 100% on you. Toronto has many issues, some of which I have personally been very vocal about, but none of the points you've mentioned are any of them.

God speed.

EDIT - so you mentioned this in your first sentence:

>I’m pretty sure my phone number started with 416.

But if you lived in Tooronto in recent history, which your reply indicates is the case, this is so incredibly unlikely.  They haven't even been close to recyling abandoned 647 area codes  since introducing 437, let alone 416.

"Boardwalk is good as others have said. Can be windy, though.

Confederation Trail is great if you're in Charlottetown. I don't know what the trail is like far outside of town for strollers, but within the city limits it's cleared and decently sheltered (except for the more open parts by the Experimental Farms).

Out by the airport there are paved walkways along the road that are good - I mean I guess you could still call them sidewalks, but they're set out farther from the road than a sidewalk so they're safer than a regular sidewalk, and are paved instead of concrete pavers.

Same for Stratford, it has some good walking spots along the road as you get away from the bridge and go down into Keppoch.

Would not recommend a lot of the nature trails -- especially out in Bonshaw -- unless you like to baby stroller parkour.

I can try and find an actual scientific study on that if you’d like once I’m off of classes for the day. But good point to add that it is primarily speculation at the moment and I will amend my comment.

Edit: To follow up, PCR tests, not RATs, should not be taken following a previous infection as it can result in a false positive. I was mistaken in my original comment as such does not apply to the OP’s case. The RAT after having a positive should not create a false positive.

Couldn’t find a link to an article that isn’t blocked by an academic paywall but here is a clip from a doctor on Good Morning America from about a month ago. I’ll try more later to find where this claim comes from.

Most suggestions from other times of the year are probably applicable, except for some obviously seasonal ones. 

There is a lot to experience, so it would depend on your interests and location! Have you been to PEI before? What do you like to do? Where will you be located?

Charlottetown has a lot of great restaurants, and the food diversity has really expanded the last 5-10 years. There are a lot of really good microbreweries (Moth Lane, Lone Oak, Village Green, Upstreet, Copper Bottom, Bogside; to name a few) and a cidery (Red Island Cider). 

There are usually live shows to be found although restrictions are still being felt here. It is nice to sightsee by car. Route 20 is a really beautiful drive with lots of beaches and bays/rivers to see. The dirt roads are usually terribly muddy this time of year so some beaches and ""off the trail"" spots can be difficult to access.

Bonshaw and Strathgartney provincial park have really nice trails for some outdoor options.

"Welcome to the area!

Blue Goose has the best dinner rolls on the island ($3.00 for 6; come in the morning and ask for them fresh from the back). Their pies are delicious too.

Blue Goose and Harvey’s are good corner stores for snacks and the occasional groceries but they are more expensive than a typical grocery store (Harvey’s selection is better).

Blue Goose is also a restaurant; they’re open for breakfast and lunch daily; suppertime hours aren’t always consistent lately because of COVID absences. They’re swamped on the weekends.

Red Rooster is open Friday, Saturday Sunday for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

South Shore Pharmacy has walk in clinics during the week and is closed on Sunday. 

The Crapaud library is located behind the fire station (pull in the parking lot and drive down the driveway to the left). They’re open Wednesday mornings, Thursday afternoons and Saturday mornings. It’s a little space and you can request items online from any library in PEI and they will be sent there.

The Crapaud post office is open Mon-Fri 8am-noon.

The South Shore Actiplex offers family skates on the weekends. There’s a gym inside with fitness classes and some weight equipment, you can find more info on the website or by calling.

Victoria-by-the-Sea has seasonal restaurants that open up in the summer (I think one is open for takeout now?). There is a wee little beach and boardwalk there as well as paddleboarding and kayak rentals in the summer.

Closest Tim’s is Borden or Cornwall. Closest gas station is Borden or New Haven. 

And, like everywhere on the Island, the quickest way to make friends is 1. Remember people’s names and 2. Don’t compare this area to where you’re from. It’s tiny and quirky and the people who live here love it! (And if they don’t, only the locals are allowed to bash it.

"Cottages in Cavendish is probably your best option for the golf side of things. Glasgow Hills, Andersons Creek, Green Gables, Eagles Glen are some of the best courses on the island and all are withith 5-10mins of each other and cottages. 

Fairway cottages, Shinning waters Inn, the gables likely all have stay and play packages. 

For nightlife there isnt a whole lot to offer in Cavendish. Rustico has a few nice spots and is only 5-10mins away, but book ahead as they can get packed in the evenings with tourists. 

Charlottetown is about a 25min drive away but itll cost a decent penny to get a cab round trip. 

Brudenell and Dunderave are amazing courses. More expensive green fees but definitely worth it. Theres a Rodd Resort you could stay at but theyre down east, as we say here, and definitely more rural area, although not too far from Montague and Georgetown that have some good restaurants etc. 

Crowbush is a Rodd Resort as well. Right on the north shore near Morrell. Aside from the course there aint much going on out that way.

"When produce is in season, I've had very good experience with the Charlottetown farmers market, both visiting the booths on Saturday and picking up orders.

This winter, the quality in the pickup orders has been a little more hit and miss, I'm not sure exactly why whether it's poor storage or lack of continuous greenhouse growing. Maybe it was just bad luck. 

I've only been on the island for a year and half. (Import from Ontario), so I haven't nearly explored all the options, and will be very interested in what other's experiences are. 

Lately I've been getting a little more creative with what I can buy at the mainstream grocery stores that's vegetarian and as locally sourced as possible, and I'm starting to hit my groove.

"Apparently I’m misinformed about my life, and I’m pretty sure my phone number started with 416.

If I lived in a more vibrant neighborhood with more restaurant choices, like closer to downtown, then meals would have probably gotten cheaper. Plus more walking instead of transit/parking/delivery fees would have been great.

For parking, what really blew up my budget was the cost to park at the building I lived in. As far as I could tell this is common in the 416. Its not common in Charlottetown. Those couple hundred per month add up.

So Toronto cost at least $3k more per year to have a car which if I stayed in TO long enough might have been given up, but that wasn’t the case.

Now we’ll take that $3k add in say $500 extra per month for real estate and boom, $10k (after taxes) is spent.",t2_5i9wx,vincepower,0,1647748575.0,0,t1_i1d5v5t,i1d5v5t,False,ISLANDEMS,t3_thbxgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/thbxgw/island_ems_wages/,Island EMS Wages,/r/PEI/comments/thbxgw/island_ems_wages/i1d5v5t/,1,r/PEI,0,1

"I'd suggest you find rental/temporary housing (if possible) to live in short term, while you explore Charlottetown and Summerside to see what they have to offer. Depending on when you're arriving, there may be cottages available at a discount, but by mid June, you may be out of luck! There are some just outside Charlottetown AND Summerside.  
I've lived in or near Charlottetown for most of my life and have enjoyed it. I also  worked in Summerside for a bit and loved it, but I also enjoyed getting back to town at the end of the day.  


Having a car is nice!  You can drive west and get off the main drag to drive the coastal routes west of Summerside, and east of Charlottetown.  Also, drives to the North Shore and South Shore, are nice.  


I'd also recommend contacting the Tourist Bureau here. They have great recommendations for all sorts of activities.  You can call them at 800-565-7421 - they're open year round, in some areas.

"> Let’s go with parking

While parking in Toronto is on **average** twice as expensive as it is in Charlottetown, you're glossing over one of your previous points that definitely makes this something not overly worth bringing up in this context, ie. transit overall is less expensive. **NOT** owning a car in Toronto is not nearly as prohibitive as it is here on the island, and when you consider things like Car2Go and Zipcar exist, and Uber and Lyft are very affordable options, I don't think this is a fair comparison. There are less than 1/3 the number of cars in Toronto as there are people, and when you consider a non-insignificant number of households own more than one car, the majority of people in Toronto are not driving. 

>car insurance

Same as above when it comes to car insurance, and even then, depending on your area code, the car insurance in Toronto is not that much more there than it is here. I drove for my first two years in Toronto and the only reason I gave it up wasn't because it was so much more expensive there than it was here on the island, it was because driving in Toronto is insane, and public transit was often even quicker so it wasn't worth it from a time/sanity perspective. When I moved back to the island and got a car again (because again, it's so much more essential here) my insurance was only $400 less a year than it was in Toronto.

>and the average restaurant meal (not fast food)

Now you've really lost me on this one. I am an avid foodie,  very well versed in the restaurant scenes in both Toronto and PEI, and honestly this is your most outrageous comment yet. I could go to Baldwin Village and get an incredible 3-course prix fixe for $35 at literally any one of the restaurants there on a normal day (Omai excluded). Here, that's a fucking deal that the city needs to subsidize restaurants for to pull off, and only then as a special seasonal event, and even then it's $45. I could get Chinese food for a fraction of the cost, and it was leaps better than anything here (with the exception of egg rolls which all have bean sprouts instead of cabbage in Toronto for some reason); one of my go-to's, New Ho King, had a late night special where I could get fucked up with a giant helping of chicken fried rice and a side for $7 and it was incredible every single time. Sure, if you wanna eat at somewhere like The Fifth Terrace, one of the O&B spots, or Scaramouche then sure, you have an argument here, but they are 100% the exception to the rule. 
>The gap is smaller than ever, but it exists.

I'm starting to wonder where in ""Toronto"" you lived to have this experience. To me it feels like you were more or less a 905er who city-tripped on the weekends, or your days off, and that's your exposure. I'm not trying to throw shade here, but your reply just seriously comes off as misinformed, cause even when I was making peanuts to the dollar as a barista and restaurant manager for my first couple years in the big smoke, I had a better quality of life by a large margin in Toronto than I do here, and that definitely includes stretching my dollar, and finding ways to do so healthfully.",t2_dmeyxdwz,FleshBamrocket,0,1647743747.0,0,t1_i1cx1l4,i1cx1l4,False,ISLANDEMS,t3_thbxgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/thbxgw/island_ems_wages/,Island EMS Wages,/r/PEI/comments/thbxgw/island_ems_wages/i1cx1l4/,2,r/PEI,0,2

There is no need to plow all the way down to the gravel, there should be a buffer layer of snow on gravel driveways, or this happens.

Your moving them back while still in snow is a very good idea. Once the snow melts and the gravel sinks into the lawn, it's much much harder to remove them.

Raking is pretty much your only option, and it's painfully slow.

Lol a lot of folks seem to think that but what makes you or I less of one. We can blame one person or look at the whole system. It's a pretty flawed system across the board and this pandemic highlights it. Cuts to health care in any way is bad for all of us but some would disagree. Some people have money and don't need it. Thanks to a recent change in public opinion (or maybe just the fact that a cirtain public figure has made it some how seem acceptable to act this way) many think that anything as liberal and communist as government funded healthcare should be gone. In reality it is a private company taking all the money and not distributing it properly. Some owners of these private companies live in a mansions and that's fine but not when their employees are hurting. Anyone who has worked in a private company funded by the goverment knows this happens. It sucks and it's stupid and its all about the politics and money. Only way to stop in is to change somthing. No idea what but somthing should be done across the board for islanders and our wages.

"I grew up in Summerside but have been in Charlottetown for about 11 years now. It should be noted that Summerside is MUCH smaller than Charlottetown.

Charlottetown is much larger, it took me 30 minutes to walk to work and I lived close by in comparison to the size of the city.

As others have said, Summerside also has far less shopping options. Top of my head, you've only got 3 grocery stores and they're all uptown, all on Granville St. There's a Wal Mart for most of your shopping needs, and multiple smaller stores, but the ""mall"" is very small.

"I grew up in Summerside but live in Charlottetown now and have for about 4 years now, plus close to 4 years total of travelling to work/college in Charlottetown while living in summerside. Having lived in both locations I would not move back to Summerside without good reason- I love that place, but I’ll explain why below.

While it does seem that Summerside ticks most of the boxes, it has some downfalls. It does have that slower pace of life feel, it’s charming, and it has an older population. It has the benefit of cheaper housing and if you don’t care about night life or really anything else outside of dining then you’re not missing out on much - although dining is not near as exciting in Summerside as it is in Charlottetown. It’s gotten better over the years but if you want endless food variety you’re better off in Charlottetown. If you don’t plan on getting a car you may have a rough time with getting around. Uptown Summerside has a lot of shopping and fast food, while downtown has more of the restaurants so it makes it tough to choose a place to really settle in where you get a bit of everything if you want to walk everywhere (I’ve always had a car so I could be wrong). Summerside does not have public transit and Charlottetowns transit is just fair I’ve heard, but I don’t have first hand experience with it. Chances are if you’re coming from a city with an established and busy public transit system you’ll be disappointed. But there was another commenter that has some better tips on that than me haha. If you’re not looking to get a car then Charlottetown is probably a better fit in my opinion. It’ll also be easier to meet people in Charlottetown if that’s important to you. This is the case in most of the island, but Summerside residents especially already have their circle of friends and people tend to keep to them. There’s been a lot of immigration in recent years though that might have changed that a bit but I’m confident it’s still similar. 

I can’t comment on the golf but I am someone who also spends a lot of nights at home rather than going out and I don’t live in town for the nightlife - it’s the restaurants hands down. Summerside has no DoorDash or SkipTheDishes (last time I checked anyways, not sure if it’ll get either anytime soon). The food options in Charlottetown are enough to keep me here. Downtown is thriving with restaurants of all varieties and cafes. Both Summerside and Charlottetown are in close proximity to many beaches and trails for hiking but you’ll probably need a car or a drive to get to them.

On a side note, some gems in Summerside are Michaels Pizzeria & also the Water St Bakery. Those two places are the only things I miss in Summerside. I also hear great things about Samuels coffee house but somehow I’ve never actually been there myself. 

Sorry for going all over the place and mostly talking about food lol. It’s late and I don’t have the brain to spend any more time revising this comment.

TL;DR: the food options are light years better in Charlottetown. Better public transit and easier to live in without a car. Summerside is charming, slower paced and cozy. Has a few gems.

"Yeah it goes up to over 27 within 5 years.  For 2 years of school, that's actually not that bad tbh... especially with OT opportunity and ability to get a job straight outta school.  The top end should be much higher, a few more steps would help here, and maybe start at 25.

The debt argument doesnt fly for me personally.  Lots of ppl are saddled with much more debt than a pcp incurs, and spend years trying to get a job in their field to start at a similar wage.  Many university grads have 50 to 80k in debt depending on their degrees, and tread water trying to enter their field for many years if ever. 

The argument that does fly is the seriousness of the job and the toll it takes on workers mentally.  They need to have enough staff to cover leave and help prevent burnout.

Words matter. You very well know this, seen you around here plenty enough to know this. He unequivocally did _not_ murder two people. 

Two people died due to his negligence, that is true.

It's OK to be upset, unquestionably. Horrendous thing. But harsh sentences in situations like this do nothing to help, and in fact merely make things worse for society. Put this guy away for 10 years and you're basically guaranteeing _we_ will be paying for him to exist for the rest of his life.

This way, he will still be able to continue to make a living, while thinking long and hard about what led to this situation. It's not likely to happen again.

Further, we all get awareness about the situation. There is a very real likelihood that something like this will be avoided in the future because of peoples awareness of this tragedy.

">I understand it’s a business but it seems like they are vindictive towards any concessions for tenants.

For me, that’s exactly the rub. From a business perspective there is no benefit to restrict half your tenants from the buildings amenities simply beyond “fuck you for being poor”. I’m sure some people could argue that it could be a cost-saving measure because it reduces maintenance of those areas (which one of the people in that conversation stated), but here are my problems with that:

1.	When subsidization of the units is included, it can be argued they receive the same amount for that unit as they would any other, it’s simply the tenant who pays less, so why the fuck not give them the same privileges?

2.	If you’ve ever lived in an apartment building or condo that has a gym or any of the other facilities that is more than 10 years old, you know the majority of these REITs or property management companies don’t keep up with the repairs and maintenance of those spaces worth a fuck, with the exception of the party rooms because they are typically the least used common area, and are usually visible once you enter the building, so they maintain that for appearances sake for any potential renters.",t2_dmeyxdwz,FleshBamrocket,0,1647465218.0,0,t1_i0xoj0g,i0xoj0g,False,FleshBamrocket,t3_tfqbxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/tfqbxq/just_learned_something_interesting_about/,Just learned something “interesting” about affordable units on the island,/r/PEI/comments/tfqbxq/just_learned_something_interesting_about/i0xoj0g/,7,r/PEI,0,7

"In any instance of fishing, make sure you are familiar with any laws around fishing. Freshwater requires a license, and a lot of saltwater species have gear use limitations, size limits and limits on how many, if any, you can keep. Some areas are also restricted in when you may fish them or closed to fishing completely. 
Fines can get fairly high for non-compliance, and claiming you were not aware will not get you out of any DFO tickets and in some cases the seizure of your fishing gear and even boat or transportation method may occur. So it’s definitely worth knowing what you are doing is completely legal before doing it. 

Not trying to be a buzz kill, just making sure you are aware. 
For example, in my area they recently imposed a bag limit and size limit on mackerel, which never had any size or bag limits before.

"Here’s a story about them failing clients! I had to unfortunately take an ambulance from my apartment last year cause I busted my hand open real bad while doing the dishes (ended up fucking up my middle extensor tendon). Anyway, few months go by and I get a call from them informing me I’ve yet to pay my bill for the ambulance. Here’s the catch, though: I never received a bill, and didn’t even know I had to pay (just got back from a decade in Toronto where it’s free). Turns out they didn’t put down my apartment number when taking down my details. Give them my full address and they tell me they’ll send the bill.

Fast forward about three weeks and I do indeed get the bill, but get this, two hours later I get a call from a collections agency stating that my file was sent to them by Island EMS. So Medavie fucks up my address, then once getting the correct address they mail the bill out, but then send me to collections before I even receive the fucking. Well I explain this to the collections people and they say they can’t reverse it, I just simply need to pay it. So I do. I then contact Island EMS and tell them it’s been paid and inform them that I’m rightfully pissed at how they handled this. Told me they would inform the credit agencies it’s been paid.

IMHO unions are only interested in their largest contingent. There simply aren’t enough paramedics to make it worth Cupe’s while. They’re more concerned about keeping the large user base happy.

"Your absolutely right. It's preposterous that a private company could offer services better and cheaper for profit through government contract, rather than as an extension of the existing health bureaucracy.  

They say Government bureaucracy gets bloated with wasted money to justify privatization.   But just look at the executives, and the assuredly high compensation our tax dollars are paying for instead of higher wages and added benefits for hard working emergency service workers.  Robert Ghiz, Bernard Lord, Ed Martin and more.  

https://medaviehs.com/about/our-leadership/

In a government run operation, these executive positions wouldn't even exist.   They only currently exist in part due to political cronyism.  

The argument is that it is shared costs between the provinces to contract out to a private entity saves money.   It does, surely, but when you account for duplication in administration, expected profits, executive salaries, it really ends up being a matter of priorities.  

Do we pay a private company to make profit off the backs of hardworking employees and play ball so that maybe one day as former premier I can make money for doing nothing with a fancy title?  

 Or do we take ownership of ems and provide good paying jobs directly with tax dollars that help support stronger families and communities?",t2_f9v6fsxa,santaslittlehelper8,0,1647397522.0,0,t1_i0u2jv7,i0u2jv7,True,clown_ass_mf,t3_teq4u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/teq4u0/lmao_i_wonder_why_hint_private_forprofit/,"LMAO I wonder why.

"> MLA’s get *paid* minimum wage.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

"Well the average family physician earns $250/260k a year before expenses and taxes. So I’m sure you can do the math. I’d love to see provincial MLA’s get payed minimum wage. That would be fun, than maybe they would understand what it means to pay people. To give you an idea Mr King makes $155 191 per year, after tax that washes out to $99 500. A family physician working let’s say 60 hours a week would earn $250 000 per year, after taxes wash out without taking in to account expenses they are left with $148 000 so a doctor who actually takes care of people who selflessly puts themselves at risk in a Pandemic, who has 12+ years of education and a mountain of debt, earn $50k more than the premier.
