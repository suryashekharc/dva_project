Also. I mean I dunno how old you are, but this is a hockey town. When the sabres are good it’s a madhouse. Yea yea if the bills win a Super Bowl the parade will be followed by fire trucks. But if the shares win a cup? That’s it boys. You’re moving to Rochester. Buffalo will be gone. 

And this sabres team. These young kids. This is a wagon. They’ll be pushing for a wildcard next year, and assuming the pegulas don’t fuck it up again, we’re pushing for a cup every year after next for at least 5.

"You would be surprised about this working in today's society at the big places.  

First, many of them, like McDonalds and Best Buy and Lowe's ( all hiring ), will have a computer typically to fill out for applications.  So it may not be a paper application, but bringing that paper helps you remember those details (education, references, groups, experience, school, etc).

Second, many of those big places are franchises or part of a franchise group so they do things differently than the corporate.  Burger King, Tim Hortons, Wendy's, Aaron's, TJ Maxx, Dicks Sporting Goods ( all hiring ) are like that.  With them doing things differently, they will often have a paper application as well.  

Third, and most importantly, walking into a place, presenting yourself well / nice and looking the manager in the eye and asking for an application goes a very very long way.  Even if the manager tells you to go home and fill it out online, now the manager has a face and name and your digital application goes right to the top of the stack.

"I respectfully disagree. Unaged wood chips, which is what I'm assuming the OP is looking for, will draw more nitrogen away from an annual plant to affect fertilizer requirements and growth because they come in contact with more surface area compared to the lighter, air gap filled mulch bed. Annuals depend heavily on the surface soil for at least a month, and wood chip competition will stunt the annual vegetables. Wood also attracts more unwanted pests vs. straw.

Straw and aged shredded leaves are far superior mulches, as they break down substantially faster, and are cheaper. 

I switched to straw 10 years ago from undyed wood mulch, and the results I've had have been much improved.

Now, when you're talking perennial plants or shrubs, wood it the way to go because the root systems are established and much deeper, so the surface soil fertility is more of a bad thing when it comes to we'd germination.",t2_12zaur,rage675,0,1648237258.0,0,t1_i23t2ss,i23t2ss,False,cab00dle,t3_tnnoh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tnnoh1/free_wood_chips_in_the_buffalo_area/,Free wood chips in the Buffalo area?,/r/Buffalo/comments/tnnoh1/free_wood_chips_in_the_buffalo_area/i23t2ss/,1,r/Buffalo,0,1

">  Without a means to track sales back to the original purchaser, how can law enforcement identify and charge the original straw purchaser? They can't

They absolutely can. Using the same methods they've been using for years in the supposed ""war on drugs"". When a criminal is caught in possession of a firearm they can't own(due to their records) they advise them during interrogation that 

""With the evidence we've gathered, we know we have you on possession of an illegal firearm during the commission of a crime- the punishment for that alone will put you in prison for the next x years. We can drop this crime from the list of charges in exchange for the name of the seller and your cooperation with getting them off the streets"" and allow any negotiation to start from there. 

If the criminal provides the information, and is willing to go along with functioning as the informant in a sting(while wearing a wire) then they have the criminal perform another buy from the straw purchaser, when the seller hands over the firearm(without completing the necessary background check\\application) you throw the damn book at him. 

There's no reason this can not be done. Hell, if they're worried about the safety of the informant, they can just arrest the seller at a later time to keep the informant's identity a secret until trial. 

>As for ghost guns, tracking firearm components would help solve that issue as well.

You can't really track individual components, as most components don't have serial numbers, and you can't put different serial numbers on each component as doing so would inevitably create a ""Ship of Theseus"" paradox due to components wearing out and needing replacement\\repair over time or discarded components from different firearms being combined into a functional firearm that's essentially untrackable. 

>As for the argument that creating a registry could lead to government forfeiture. I can see that argument. Were a database in existence when the Safe Act was passed, NY could have sent letters to addresses demanding forfeiture. I guess, as a gun owner, I'm willing to take that risk and subsequent fight in order to address the biggest source of illegal guns in our nation.

Thank you for at least admitting that you understand the government can\\would try to use such a registry to enforce compliance with ordinances. If a registry ever exists, it would be used...I know it, you know it, and deep down everyone knows it, but most people in the ""gun control"" crowd won't admit it because it's the biggest step down the path towards the eventual disarmament of law-abiding citizens. That's why I won't support it(and many others don't). 

Look at what happened after Hurricane Katrina. You had individuals acting under the power of governmental authority in an emergency disarming the populous at gunpoint. That is the very situation the founders wanted to prevent, and we've already seen it happen in our lifetime once.",t2_3m3z6,omegadeity,0,1648222933.0,0,t1_i22soo1,i22soo1,False,threat_cake1,t3_tmgcmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tmgcmg/buff_state_cancels_classes_tells_staff_to_leave/,"Buff State cancels classes, tells staff to leave due to threat",/r/Buffalo/comments/tmgcmg/buff_state_cancels_classes_tells_staff_to_leave/i22soo1/,0,r/Buffalo,0,0

We've been operating on a system of punishment for years and it's pretty clear it's not working.  How could it?  Without a means to track sales back to the original purchaser, how can law enforcement identify and charge the original straw purchaser? They can't.  So what we are left with is a system where the straw purchaser continues to sell guns to felons without penalty.  That's a broken system. If we are to get serious about gun violence and stopping illegal guns from getting in the hands of criminals, preventing those sales is where our efforts need to be focused.  As for ghost guns, tracking firearm components would help solve that issue as well.  

As for the argument that creating a registry could lead to government forfeiture.  I can see that argument.  Were a database in existence when the Safe Act was passed, NY could have sent letters to addresses demanding forfeiture.  I guess, as a gun owner, I'm willing to take that risk and subsequent fight in order to address the biggest source of illegal guns in our nation.",t2_1ny7rnt,CalmerThanYouAre_716,0,1648220933.0,0,t1_i22nme9,i22nme9,False,threat_cake1,t3_tmgcmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tmgcmg/buff_state_cancels_classes_tells_staff_to_leave/,"Buff State cancels classes, tells staff to leave due to threat",/r/Buffalo/comments/tmgcmg/buff_state_cancels_classes_tells_staff_to_leave/i22nme9/,2,r/Buffalo,0,2

">and track ALL sales.

No. I can never and will never support a universal firearms registry. 

You could not possibly ""track all sales"" without such a registry, as you'd have to have a list of who is in possession of each and every firearm in the country at a given time in order to update ownership when a sale happens. 

There are already plenty of laws on the books to prevent and punish offenders who perform strawman buys\\sales. Enforce those laws, and if the punishment on those laws is not severe enough, by all means increase the punishment on those breaking those laws to severely punish the offenders and provide deterrent to those considering breaking them. 

The police are free to perform as many undercover stings as they want to get the bad firearm dealers off the streets. Revoke their FFL's permanently, throw their asses in federal prison, and throw away the fucking key, but the answer to existing laws that are not being actively enforced is not to continue to add new laws in the hopes that they will suddenly fix the perceived problem.

Additionally- there is literally no way to create such a registry- even if the firearms industry completely shut down overnight in every corner of the planet and companies stopped producing weapons, and the government suddenly mandated that every citizen register their weapons- we still wouldn't be able to-

There are a lot of 3D printed guns out there, and the schematics for printing them can quickly be found and downloaded online. Additionally, there are guides out there on how to assemble a firearm by buying each and every piece individually and assembling the firearm yourself...essentially creating a ""ghost"" gun with no serial number to track.

But the call to create a ""national registry of firearms"" is a non-starter for many gun rights advocates- because even if it were technically possible to create such a registry. Because once a registry exists, it can be used to enforce compliance with governmental demands for disarmament. 

Additionally, such a list can be used by insurance companies to raise the cost of homeowners insurance on firearm owners in certain areas to the point where the people in most needs of firearms for protection can't afford to legally own them.",t2_3m3z6,omegadeity,0,1648219403.0,0,t1_i22jt9q,i22jt9q,False,threat_cake1,t3_tmgcmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tmgcmg/buff_state_cancels_classes_tells_staff_to_leave/,"Buff State cancels classes, tells staff to leave due to threat",/r/Buffalo/comments/tmgcmg/buff_state_cancels_classes_tells_staff_to_leave/i22jt9q/,1,r/Buffalo,0,1

"The median household income in Buffalo-Niagara was $60,000 in 2019. Most people aren’t as poor as you think.

That means half the population can comfortably afford $1,600 rent.

Also, most don’t make minimum wage, it’s not hard to find work in the $15-$20 range.

Also, we’re only talking about a few thousand apartments being built in the $1,600-$2,000 range over the past half decade. It’s a drop in the bucket overall. Just as many subsidized apartments have been built. 201 Ellicott, Jefferson Street Apartments, Mt Aaron, etc

"I worked in the industry for 2 decades, in a variety of establishments and every FOH position. 

I think we need to change the system. The shitty wage inequalities driven by prejudice that we see between groups in other industries are present in tipping.

"That’s definitely part of it. The higher rent gets, the more profitable they get meaning developers are more likely to build units.

There’s also still generous tax credit from NYS to restore old historic buildings. Developers seem to be more willing to take a chance on an iffy area compared to being risk adverse like they were half a decade ago. Maybe population growth is finally giving them and banks the confidence to expand development outside the popular neighborhoods.

There’s also several successful affordable housing projects completed on the Eastside that no doubt is helping to pave the way forward.

I think the scary part is that we need to be building 2,000 new units every year just to keep up with population growth and attrition. We’re at best only building half of that.

Really exciting stuff to see.

Broadway Fillmore has actually doubled in population from 2010 to 2020 thanks to an influx of Bangladeshi escaping the high costs of NYC. Lots of new ethnic markets and eateries popping up.

"I'll second Valu for minor work. I brought my 2012 Altima there for oil changes, tire rotations, breaks, etc and the price was always reasonable and I thought they did a good job.

"I just went to D'Avolios website and saw via their takeout online ordering that they use Toast POS. So I can explain the retail tipping because I work IT with a restaurant that has a similar situation, bar/restaurant and retail store, and uses Toast POS.

The Toast POS system has an all or nothing customer facing tip screen option. If you want it turned on in the bar/restaurant, it will be turned on in the retail store too. Or it can be turned off everywhere which obviously isn't what you want for the bar/restaurant.

My place is not a fan of this and have complained to Toast about it. There should be an option to enable/disable it on the individual devices or based on the revenue center. They ended up putting up signs in the retail area saying tips aren't expected

TLDR: The POS system needs to update their software so places can choose where they want the tip to screen to come up or not",t2_6vb0n,cuterocky,0,1648144973.0,0,t1_i1ykdg4,i1ykdg4,False,marthtater,t3_tm20x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tm20x7/following_up_on_uhockey38276_s_post_this_specific/,"Following up on /u/hockey38276 's post, this specific restaurant has been ""suggesting"" inflated tips for over 4 years....

No.  You shouldn't and freaking can't compel someone to speak to police by taking away their pensions.  And, no, you shouldn't take away welfare or other public assistance to compel them to speak to police.

You progressive jackasses talk about how the right wants to create an authoritarian state and take away all of your freedoms but are too stupid to realize that this **always** comes from the left.  The only way a government gets too much power is when people like you want to leverage government to force people to do things and revoke rights.

"Hi all, I saw /u/hockey38276 's post this morning, and realized I had a similar situation a few years ago.... So I took a scroll through my camera roll, and found I actually saved a picture of the receipt (I had posted it to snapchat at the time). 

This was 4 years ago, so I don't remember all the details such as whether my check was split or not, though Hockey's was not.

Also this is only a sample size of 2, so **I'm NOT out here advocating for an all out witch hunt or Duffs boycott**. I just think it's a little crazy that after 4+ years, management still hasn't fixed whatever the issue is.

Rather, it's gone from the 20% line suggesting a 25% tip in my case, to the 20% line suggesting about a 32% tip in Hockey's case.

Once again, maybe it's a weird bug. I lived in Cleveland the last few years and only just moved back to Buffalo, so I haven't been back to this (or any) Duffs since 2017. I will try to follow up soon though, just to see if this was one-off or not.

Finally, regardless of this, please tip your wait staff well! The internet is great at reminding us there are a lot of Karens in the world, and while you might be the perfect customer, some people really make customer service jobs a pain.

Thanks for your time, guys!


Edit: just wanted to share a method I use to calculate about a 20% tip in my head. If this doesn't jive with you there's plenty of other methods online too. What I like to do is double the dollar amount, then move the decimal one to the left (AKA divide by 10).
So, for my pictured check, that'd be $34 *2, to get $68. Then you just move the decimal, and it's $6.80--that's your tip! That's a bit below 20% because you ignore the cents, so I like to round up or tack on a couple bucks more for good service.",t2_y2fxr,marthtater,0,1648128563.0,0,t1_i1xf37r,i1xf37r,True,marthtater,t3_tm20x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tm20x7/following_up_on_uhockey38276_s_post_this_specific/,"Following up on /u/hockey38276 's post, this specific restaurant has been ""suggesting"" inflated tips for over 4 years....

"I waited tables for many years. And I can tell you everything that the comment you replied to is 100% true for a good server. 

There are days where you'll make $10ish an hour, but most of the time you'd be walking out with closer to $25-$30 per hour, sometimes more. And I wasn't working at the fanciest of places. 

It's all about being ""good enough"" (or knowing how to play the system) to get the good shifts. 

Not a single server I know would want to remove the tip system. Not a single one. 

I'm all for paying the servers a flat rate and removing the tipping system entirely, but I can almost gaurentee that most restaurants cannot afford to pay their servers $20-$30 per hour. Even if some restraints could, you know full well that ownership isn't passing that on to their employees. And if they did, cooks (rightlyfully so) would want that much or more as well.

"This is a popular rant, but the ugly truth is:  Most service employees would rather keep the tipping system.  They make more through tips than they would through increased wages.

- With the tipping system in place, servers on average earn $19-25 an hour- and many earn even more.  [source](https://whytippingworks.com/)

- When they are tipped in cash, most servers do not report the income on their taxes, which means their income is higher than reported.

- A NYC study conducted by the NYC Hospitality Alliance found that the median hourly income (including tips) of servers exceeded that of line cooks by 112 percent.

"I'm sure, if it's a POS system error, that Duff's could, at some point, call their POS vendor and just ask them to reprogram the system to remove the whole ""Suggested Tip"" part of the receipt.

I don't attribute it to malice on Duff's part unless there is real proof of this, IMO. Usually, people are just lazy and don't care about the details that others pore over so much here.

"I bought my elderly  neighbor a Thanksgiving dinner from Cracker Barrel. The place was packed when I went to pick it up. I parked to have food brought out to car and after waiting over half an hour I went inside..  it was total chaos.. there were so many people inside.

I've never eaten there before but based on how many people were there I assume it's decent food. I didn't open the container but it looked like their was a substantial amount of food.

Don’t go to the Casino: it’s just a sad sad place.

"None of these accusations of corruption pass the smell test for me. They just don't.

In a market as small as Buffalo, and as long as Brown has been in office, it would be difficult to find a contractor who had never at one point in time donated to Brown. Of course some of them will get contracts with the city.

I don't see Brown lining his pockets, having special favors done for him, hiring multiple family members for city jobs, seeking revenge on rivals, etc. That's what previous mayors did.

I see occasional sloppy rule following, lazy oversight, irresponsible corner-cutting, poor or inept staff decisions, and mismanagement of grant money. These are management issues, not corruption issues. Many are within the mayor's control, but many are not.

Overall he has done what most mayors have not - he doesn't make things worse.

I had adopted a cat with the same condition as yours, and the vets here took such amazing care of my Stanley, up until the end. He ended up having CHF and ultimately passed from pleural effusion. Dr. Caurana tried EVERYTHING in her power to save him throughout that 4 day nightmare.  She called me the day after i was told by a newer person there that he was a goner...She called me the first thing the next morning to discuss treatments and procedures that could potentially save him. She really went so above & beyond with her care. They treat your animals like their own pets.

"I had grand jury duty about 10 years ago.  I actually really enjoyed it, but...

* It was May (nice weather).
* I didn't particularly like my job at the time.
* I lived right off Elmwood, so I had almost door-to-door bus service.
* I'm a dork.

A grand jury is what decides whether or not a case goes to trial.  It's sort of the opposite of the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" thing you see in movies.  If you think there's a reasonable chance that a crime might have been committed, then you vote in favor of sending it to trial.  You're not the group deciding whether or not the accused person is guilty-- just whether or not it's worth looking into by having a trial.  I don't know the stats, but I believe it's pretty rare to decide against indictment.  This is where that ""You can indict a ham sandwich"" thing comes from, if you've ever heard that.

You won't be focusing on one case.  Grand juries hear a quick pitch from the prosecution, about several different cases per day.  You might have 10 on a really busy day.  Or maybe like two or three, if it's a quiet day.  You do that for whatever pre-defined period of time and frequency, and then you're done.  Mine was two days per week for about a month.  In a regular jury case, you stay as long as the trial takes, whether it's zero days (settling before going to court) or a bazillion days.

The thing about New York State is that every felony requires indictment by a grand jury automatically.  And lots of things can be felonies, for example certain kinds of drunk-driving, like if the person is super-drunk (i.e., DW-really-I) or if it's a repeat offense.  So a lot of the cases are pretty simple and boring.  When I had grand jury duty, there were just a handful of cases that I thought were genuinely interesting.  Maybe even one or two that you might vaguely remember from the news (though probably not... they weren't *that* interesting or noteworthy).  But strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to say anything about them, ever.  Those records are not open to the public.

You might get a long lunch break.  I remember some being like two hours long, because that was just the way the officials' and lawyers' schedules worked out that day.  I did the free City Hall tour on one of those breaks.  At the time, at least, it was every day at noon in the building lobby, but I don't know if they're still doing that or what.  Speaking of lunch, if any of the hotdog guys are outside of the building, they can be a quick, easy, and cheap sources of lunch.  You know, the guys with the grill carts who sell you a dog and pop for like five bucks, or whatever the deal is now.",t2_hd3ywkz2,Semi-Pros-and-Cons,0,1648079304.0,0,t1_i1v64cs,i1v64cs,True,michellelmybell,t3_tkw4gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tkw4gx/jury_duty/,Jury Duty,/r/Buffalo/comments/tkw4gx/jury_duty/i1v64cs/,3,r/Buffalo,0,3
