"Every beach you could possibly go to in the states is going to have a pack of dipshits not far away. I don’t care how expensive the area is, the dipshits just get richer. For that matter, we have 70 million people here who think a guy who pays $125,000 to sleep with a porn star and cheat on his wife and was great friends with a Jeff Epstein good Christian, they think a guy who owns no oil wells controls the price of gas, they talk about things like “family values” while watching shows like the bachelor, and they modify trucks to look like they are carrying a load of bricks but they would scoff at actually doing any physical work. so in all of the United States of America, you are just never far away from a bunch of dipshits.

The Boardwalk is pretty safe during the day to sundown. They have free entertainment and sometimes kid oriented events.

"\*\*\* **South Myrtle.** DinoLand Cafe has animated dinosaurs. Nearby, if he has a lot of energy Radical Ropes has children's level ropes course.  Burroughs & Chapin Museum (free) usually have a kids gallery and sometimes kids events. Also, FunPlex opened up last summer - it's a smaller amusement park for kids. Affordable souvenirs, tshirts and flip-flops at the $5 & $5.99 Or Less Stores.

\*\*\* **Fishing** & crabbing from a pier. Fishing and crabbing now requires a license. You can get temporary licenses at places like Walmart to fish from the beach shore. Great deal if you are driving and bringing your own poles and gear. Two poles allowed per license.   Myrtle has new rule, that fishers have to stay away from swimmers.  However, fishing from Piers does not require a license but there's a fee to fish and rent poles from the piers. Myrtle Beach State Park has poles and gear to rent and bait. General admission is like $8 adults/$4.50 kids. This park also has nature trails and a small ocean life & nature museum.

**\*\*\* Broadway at the Beach** \- WonderWorks, Ripley's Aquarium, has small rides park with nicel laser light ferris wheel, fireworks Tuesdays and Fridays. Lots of parking here so it's easy to get in and out. They also have a Dave & Buster's. Nearby, across highway, is the Myrtle Waves Water Park (go early to get loungers & chairs) is a blast.

\*\*\* **Sky Wheel** at the **Boardwalk.** Time your arrival for sundown. You will beat the night crowds. The Boardwalk has free entertainment at times.  Google for event calendar. The Gay Dolphin is a must see--multi-story souvenir shop, packed with junk.

\*\*\* **Market Commons has -** 810 Bowling, has bowling, billiards and game stations, like foosball, etc. Also, inside 810 is famous Crazy Mason milkshake bar.  Savannah's Playground is free and nearby.  Cinema 14 there is nice movie theater. They also have kids events at times. Google their calendar.

\*\*\* **Huntington Beach State Park** is about 30 minutes south of Myrtle - has viewing areas for sea birds and alligators, including Alligator Alley trail. f

\*\*\* **Barefoot Landing** \- has TIGERS preservation station - it's a short but free baby wild cats show. Was twice per day, now one show per day around 5pm or 6pm. Alligator Adventure is next to Barefoot--very popular.  Also, has amusements and rides for kids and another ropes' course at Lulu's.

\*\*\* **Pirates Voyage Dinner Show** \- heard people with kids love this. Kind of pricey. Check discount coupon books and if you are staying at big hotel they may have deals. Also, read kids love the Pirate Adventure Park. 

\*\*\* Off the beaten path, **Waccamaw River Tours** wildlife tour, runs down the Waccamaw River, 1.5 hours. Also, the **Waccatee Zoo** is nearby, which is pretty interesting - some  ongoing controversy over how they treat exotic animals like monkeys. However, they have a great collection of native animals, mammals, repitles and birds, and very scenic property for walking. Take the deck path to the river--beautiful.

There's lots to do for family and kids in Myrtle Beach.  Also, try to pick hotel/resort that has multiple pools, lazy river, a few have kiddie pools with fountains and such.",t2_puecgb,CAZelda,0,1648226356.0,0,t1_i231k7y,i231k7y,True,Far_Path9132,t3_tlg7sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/tlg7sb/things_to_do/,Things to do,/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/tlg7sb/things_to_do/i231k7y/,2,r/MyrtleBeach,0,2

"I can’t believe no one has suggested anything for you yet. I’ve only lived here for 2yrs in May, but I have a 7yr old so.. Let me help ya out. Lol. So there are a couple smaller amusement parks with fun rides and stuff on the Boardwalk right in the middle of Myrtle Beach. Then there is one slightly larger and a bit more on the southern end called Family Kingdom. Also the Boardwalk has Ripleys Believe it or Not and that’s fun. Then there are plenty of quick fun kinda things like a haunted house.. arcades and all that. Now up on the other side of 17 is Broadway at the Beach and they have tons of fun stuff including yet another amusement park, Ripleys Aquarium and just so much fun stuff I can’t list it all. You can Google Broadway at the Beach and go right to there website with a complete listing of everything. The zip-line places are super fun too and our age of kiddos love them! If I think of more specific things I’ll add in. 
  Places to avoid… you’ll see it immediately. It’s just like anywhere else really. Yucky looking streets or stores. Creepers walking the streets. As a whole it’s really not too bad.

"College student born and raised in myrtle here. If you're 21, happy hour at the marshwalk in murrells inlet is fun, going to broadway is fun too as you mentioned because there's something for everyone there from bars, restaurants, distilleries, and shops , to clubs, fun rides and the aquarium, and I'm pretty sure you can pay to ride in a speedboat on the lake in the middle still. The boardwalk downtown during the day has the arcade and ripleys and different touristy stuff that can be fun. Would not recommend going there at night. If you go to the beach I'd personally recommend anywhere from Surfside to Pawleys Island, or Cherry Grove on the north end (just personal preference, the heart of myrtle can get crowded/isn't as peaceful). If you're looking for something outdoors and you have artsy people in your group, Brookgreen Gardens and the Zoo in the gardens could be fun for a morning/afternoon (even if you're not artsy its a cool place to take pics). If you wanna shop, there are 2 Tanger Outlets, one on Hwy 17, one on 501, and the coastal grand mall too. Ik gas is expensive but if you wanna explore more of the area, day trips to Charleston are fun but that can get pricey depending on what you do.

"People make poor decisions at all ages and walks of life. It could be a scam or it could be legit. I don't fault you for calling out the risk here.

That said I think you over emphasis the assistance police can provide, and people's willingness to use the police. Most of the time they won't even offer you so much as a quick ride nor to use their phone. Not saying cops are bad though, it's just their rules and regulations may honestly tie their hands in the matter. If someone took cash your not getting it back, and sometimes all folks mean is that the other person was the primary provider so they don't have anything to use. 

Also, there are a lot of folks who travel with not enough money and don't have backups like active/valid credit or debit cards. If the dude has her credit card, yeah that is a good move to call the cops and get it back. But on the flipside, your SO takes you on vacation and most things are covered, maybe she doesn't have a credit card or didn't bring it due not wanting to spend on it. She didn't stop at the ATM before because she didn't expect drama. You have a debit card you don't usually use or forgot the pin on. Boom - 3 fairly normal/easy decisions that leave you in a perfect storm when they get together.

"I appreciate the feed back and response. I am actually 3 years sober and my mental health is under control and In a good place. I use to teach golf and play on the local mini tours. But stopped to focus on me. But with that I have created connections over the years with local pros and courses and companies. So that’s going to help get this up and running. My ultimate goal with it, would be too have it open to anyone even people with family members who struggle. Plan is to have it open to people from Myrtle beach down to Pawleys. Have bi weekly golf (1 round) and then monthly tournaments. Maybe different set ups( teams of two, scrambles, different games. Obviously keep it simple to start. But with the total idea of making it like a year long thing with different divisions and maybe even a point system kinda like the fed ex cup. Obviously it’s going to be a lot of work, but I know it could work if enough people are interested. I am just trying to put feelers out there too see what kind of interest there is. But my first goal is just too get sign ups and then put together a day at a nice course and get everyone together, then go from there. Honestly I don’t have any expectations and I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t end up happening, but I am going to give it a go. If any of that makes sense. If your interested and or know people that might be, any help getting the idea out there would be great. I have access to get on all the good courses.

Then back to dead until valentines and things have a hint of picking up as spring breakers come to myrtle.  The restaurant industry in Myrtle beach... doesn't hire when people are in school.  Most restaurants can get by with a skeleton crew during the off season.,t2_e85p7js9,Maraudertoosee,0,1647847150.0,0,t1_i1i5nj1,i1i5nj1,True,TwoAnonymousLemons,t3_tiic9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/tiic9q/unable_to_find_employment/,Unable to find employment?,/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/tiic9q/unable_to_find_employment/i1i5nj1/,1,r/MyrtleBeach,0,1

"I'm just gonna lay it down for you.  There is PLENTY of work for this guy.  He just refuses to work for what they are paying (especially if he is from somewhere else where he probably made almost twice as much).  I'm proud of younger people taking a stand and demanding a living wage.  But as a middle-aged guy who has grown up here and recently left his career over a moral stand against my old boss, I had zero problem going back to my teenage mode.  And, back in the day, if you wanted to pay your bills down here you knew it was going to be service industry and only slightly above minimum wage.  Most people had two low paying jobs or just lived very modestly.  In order to keep my standard of living from when I had a ""real profession"", I now have three jobs with mediocre pay.  Young people would call me a sucker.  But I would rather take a vacation and always have money in my pocket than take a stand.  My three low-paying jobs are taking me to Hawaii this summer.  I just don't wanna be that guy waiting to retire to enjoy his money and time. Because being healthy in your 60's or 70's is not promised to you.

"They've done it every year.  I used to work at the airport as well, and when they arrive, they know very little about where they are staying.  Some can barely speak any English.  It was evident when their bag was delayed, because they could only tell us where they were scheduled to work.

They are students, about college age, that come from overseas to earn money, have the experience, and fill the seasonal jobs here.  Locals can't really fill them as the ones that can, do already.  And the ones that don't work seasonal don't want to at all; they want full time.  And some of these places aren't available for year round full time employment.  If we think the college or even high school, because our tourist season begins before the local students get out for the summer and ends well after the students go back in the fall, that's not viable either for the season.  

But the other thing is businesses get a break for hiring them.  Whether it's a grant, or a tax write-off, IDK but they do get something.  And housing them as well.  Oh people will say it's an expense as if it's a burden to do it, but they still do as if Uncle Sam is forcing them to house people against their will.  And since that's impossible, there has to be some financial benefit to housing the J1 students as well.

The last time I was at Food Lion @ 61st Ave North was about 2 months ago, but they even have a sign posted on their windows soliciting for people to house the J1s, and it talks about the benefits you can get from doing so.  All in Food Lion branding as well.  

I can recall over 10 years ago, a couple of Russian girls worked at the Subway on Mr Joe White Ave.  A few of us from work would go there weekly, or even every other day.  When they first came, they were green.  Barely understood English.  Barely knew how to make a sandwich.  They improved greatly.  Then they told us they were leaving to go to Texas and work there as well.  About 2 weeks later they returned, they didn't care for Texas.  But my actual point is they work everywhere.  Not just the touristy parts (although I suppose that Subway location gets a lot of business thanks to Myrtle Waves).  We're talking lifeguards as well.  Or even a job at Paula Deen's in Broadway, which is actually funny to hear an Eastern European person try to say ""Y'all.""  Even when Freestyle was still open, locals got laid off while foreign workers stayed on because of the contracts involving their employment; they couldn't be fired, it was easier to lay off the locals.

But yeah, last April they didn't come due to Covid.  And all throughout the summer all you saw were help wanted signs, and all you heard were how places were short handed, or worse when some of these places said the locals were lazy and didn't want to work.  Even if some of us didn't want to work, we weren't going to work for them (I'm referring to Bouy's in NMB).",t2_iz2k8keg,Throwaway_inSC_79,0,1647832216.0,0,t1_i1hjl7e,i1hjl7e,False,TwoAnonymousLemons,t3_tiic9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/tiic9q/unable_to_find_employment/,Unable to find employment?,/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/tiic9q/unable_to_find_employment/i1hjl7e/,5,r/MyrtleBeach,0,5

"So many places in the area, many corporate ones as well, got the payment protection plan loans last year.

To prevent paying all that back, they have to hire.  Or rather, show that they are actively looking for employees.  That can mean putting a posting on Indeed.  Having a sign out front.  Even having a sign that says they are short staffed.

Now, thats not every place.  But how many places were hurting last summer, and no longer made those same complaints once fall hit?  Do they need help in the summer?  Sure, but they dont hire locals typically, they get J1 visa students.  And those didn't come last year, so suddenly locals were the problem for not wanting to work.

Now, maybe the same thing will happen this year.  Those students tend to come from Russia and Ukraine, and thats going to be a bit difficult.

"I recommend going to Top Golf if you have never played before. Its a fancy driving range. You rent a bay and the clubs are included. There is no judgement and the attendants will bring you food and drinks/beer/cocktails (extra cost). It is fun,.

If you go to a golf course they will likely pair you up with 3 other players. If they are good,  they might get frustrated pretty quickly for having to wait for you on every hole.

If you do decide to go to a course. They will have a driving range and a putting green that you can practice on.

"My opinion would be to run on the beach. Safer than the streets. Just what I’ve observed myself, I would definitely go that route. Unfortunately the mid to south part of Myrtle has a good bit of nastiness out there… like any tourist city does. As the wife of a LEO my advice is regardless of your location always stay alert. If you run with headphones in, keep one ear open to the world around you so you can hear what might be coming. Open your maps app and look at the streets prior to leaving so you have a route mapped out. Your friends should know your general running area you’ve picked and a general time of when you’ll return, just to air on the side of caution. There is safety in numbers. If you’re running alone, giving your friends that info will serve as a backup if heaven forbid anything happen. But these are all pretty common sense type of things. I don’t see the need for you to worry excessively about danger.

The ocean was a little chilly this last time for my husband and I but our 3 young kids loved it! The weather is always great! We sat by the pool and on the beach every day with drinks and watched the kids swim. I would say low 80’s during the day and 70s in the evening. We go mini golfing in the evenings and some stuff the kids like to do outside and we always take light jackets and sweatshirts. We love that week…it’s honestly the perfect weather.,t2_7ihogtrz,Ok_Art_7733,0,1647371560.0,0,t1_i0sbklt,i0sbklt,False,greasyhotdog69,t3_te32hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/te32hf/question_regarding_may_weather_and_bike_week/,"Question regarding may weather, and bike week",/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/te32hf/question_regarding_may_weather_and_bike_week/i0sbklt/,1,r/MyrtleBeach,0,1

"We go every year at the end of May and always are there for one bike week or the other. We stay in North Myrtle so it’s not as crowded with bikes. 

It’s honestly not bad. Bikers get a bad rep which is ironic because most bikers would do anything they could to help someone out. They won’t swarm you and run you off the road for shits and giggles lol. Just be cautious of them and check twice before changing lanes or turning. 

Last year we were there over Black Bike Week. We sat on our balcony at night and watched them go by with their led lights on and their music up.

"Fellow Locals, please correct me if I am wrong.  I have not left the beach, nor returned to the beach, on any Saturday during the tourist season in many years.  So things may have changed during the last ten years or so.  

But some of the most miserable hours I have spent in my life involved being in a Saturday afternoon gridlock on one of the few roads in and out of the Grand Strand, while the sun warmed up my car like a tin can over a backyard grill.  Why Saturday you ask?  Because the vast majority of hotels, motels and other places that cater to out of towners (real estate rental offices, etc.) spending a week at the beach insist that everybody check out by 10 or 11 am on Saturday mornings, but they won't let anybody check-in before 4:00 on Saturdays.  May 22 is a Sunday, so going towards the beach should not be too bad.  But you plan to leave on a Saturday.  The same Saturday that one of the biker groups is also leaving.  I am not at all pointing a negative finger at either biker group. Instead, I am just saying that a large group of bikers will be sharing those two-lane roads leading away from the beach.  

If you can, leave super early in the day, or leave late afternoon, just to avoid heavy, slow traffic.  The rest of your visit should be a little more interesting than the other average weeks.  Every year at least 1 to 3 cars collide with one or two bikers on the same bike.  The accident usually throws both bikers in a long arc, killing them on impact.  While you are here during that week, keep your eyes and ears alert for a biker riding in your blind spot.  Before pulling out into traffic, check and double-check over both shoulders to make sure you won't be the next person to send one or two innocent bikers sailing in an arc to their death.  Seriously, they will be grouped in the usual, popular places, so be very aware.",t2_13blhj,Pawleysgirls,0,1647300131.0,0,t1_i0oj74i,i0oj74i,True,greasyhotdog69,t3_te32hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/te32hf/question_regarding_may_weather_and_bike_week/,"Question regarding may weather, and bike week",/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/te32hf/question_regarding_may_weather_and_bike_week/i0oj74i/,1,r/MyrtleBeach,0,1

"Black bike week is in reference to Atlantic Beach where many events are hosted out off. Atlantic Beach is a historically black beach community 

- During the 1960s and 1970s in the thick of segregation, many of the Black motorcyclists – having been turned away from Harley Davidson Week – turned to Atlantic Beach because it was the only beach in the entire southern United States where Black families were welcomed and not banned. https://bikeweek.com/myrtle-beach-bike-week/black-bike-week-history/

It's not a bad time at all, Lots of cool bikes to see, some hand built, some really tricked out. You can be as involved or not as you want to be. Just have to be super cautious driving, which is a normal thing in a tourist community during start of the busy season.

I think now white week is more Harley style bikes and black bike week is more of the Japanese style bikes. It's a good mix of both on both weeks. Last year I saw the Swarovski crystal bike, so cool! Lots of full time residents head over to some of the big events to check out all the bikes. It's fun. 

The weather could be spring like or full on summer at that point.

"I feel for you OP, and I’m glad you have appointments to resolve this dilemma.  My sister is American but has lived in Europe for the last 20+ years.  She and her SO come here for Christmas every year and stay for a month.  This past Christmas the country she lives in changed the requirements for the type of test needed while they were visiting,  when it was administered, and the number of hours she was given to get the results back before boarding a plane.  Since she doest know the area very well I told her I would find them the right clinic.  

Literally, it took me hours and hours and hours to find a clinic for them.   They had to have a specific test, administered 48 hours or less before boarding, with the results printed on their form.   The biggest trouble I had was the results for that type of test were not guaranteed to be back in their hands in less than 48 hours before leaving for the airport.  The next biggest problem was that neither person had a state issued ID.  Of course, both of them had current passports.  My sister let her license expire years ago and her SO has never learned to drive since they live in a big city with excellent public transportation.  Although CVS and Walmart advertised “results in 24 hours“  the timer begins when the lab actually picks up the samples and ends when the test is performed.  There can be a significant lag time between the test given and the results conveyed to the people who took the test.  It was a really frustrating and scary time when we really thought they might not be able to go back  home anytime soon.  Finally I found a private clinic that typically caters to ex-military, but they welcomed these two with open arms.  They did the test approx. 40 hours before boarding.  Two hours later my sister and her SO rode away with the form filled out completely.  The next morning they boarded a plane for Atlanta and passed the proof of Covid test easily.  

But why is there such difficulty jumping through so many hoops? Surely other non Americans have had to go through this heart wrenching ordeal?? These two had me, a long term local, doing all the calling and searching the internet.  What about people who have to find a place by themselves?  This issue could be resolved by the airport and airlines supplying this info, since fhey are the entity requiring such info.  I will add the name of the clinic as soon as I find it’s name and address.  Good luck to anybody else out there who has to find the right clinic, at the right time, who will issue a specific form, etc.",t2_13blhj,Pawleysgirls,0,1647186431.0,0,t1_i0i3l0b,i0i3l0b,True,AtTheEndOfMyTrope,t3_tct5ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/tct5ia/help_my_family_is_trapped_im_myrtle_beach/,Help!

"Yes they do land at MYR, but thats not why it gets called ""international.""  That would be like saying Porter could start flying to FLO and suddenly that would get renamed to Florence International Airport.

That wouldn't happen, because FLO is a ""regional airport"" and doesn't have the facilities to handle an international flight.  And thats not runway length, because Porter doesn't require a long runway and yet is an international carrier.

MYR has the capabilities to process an international flight, and had that ""international"" in its name for longer than it had international flights.  Having passengers come from other countries doesn't give it that name either, as that would mean nobody flying YYZ to ATL can continue to FLO or EWN.  They can, and do.  They cleared customs at an ""international airport.""

But yes I do agree that there should be screening at any airport, not just international, for that reason that when you fly out, you have to have your passport at your originating airport.  If the flights are on the same itinerary, you cannot fly MYR>ATL>YYZ and expect to pick up your passport from a family member in ATL.  I've seen it happen, and yes they've been denied boarding.  And with the same reason, you have to have that negative covid test, which are getting increasingly more difficult to find as we just don't care anymore in this state.

But this was also an issue when flights started back up in 2020, but we didn't have readily available testing.

Sounds to me like a lack of communication on the bureaucratic side. - there should have been a cessation of requiring results before boarding an airline if the on-site testing lab was closed down by the State. - it really makes zero sense if this was a federal funded on site testing facility. - Now it presents an opportunity for a local business to make money by being recommended as the place to head to for travelers that need them pronto - I do hope you are able to accomplish what you need and you can then return home safely.,t2_57dbqadq,TheOriginalSpartak,0,1647168024.0,0,t1_i0h8xc4,i0h8xc4,True,AtTheEndOfMyTrope,t3_tct5ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/tct5ia/help_my_family_is_trapped_im_myrtle_beach/,Help!

"One final RANT-- South Carolina is a Conservative controlled low income tax State. There is just not enough money to build the infrastructure needed to handle the growing traffic. The larger cities like Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville do fine and get their infrastructure. But speaking for Horry County, we need to place a moratorium on building homes until the roads are built in the areas where there is going to be 1000 new homes built, for example. That number is thrown out by me, but certainly not unrealistic. I was just up on State Road 57, near North Myrtle Beach. There were at least 5 new housing developments in progress, cleared and lots marked off, or signs trumpeting a new development. All on a few mile stretch of a twisting, narrow, already overcrowded road. This was between Hwy 90 and Hwy 9 in the Wampee section of the County. Google map it!!

"Being a native here, yes, you need to be on guard. Remember-- tourists do not know the roads, do not know the exact locations for venues they are trying to find, and are distracted by the passengers in the vehicle. They are prone to suddenly slamming on the brakes, swerving across lanes to get to where they are going when they finally locate it. Driving in the left lane and the center lane is usually safer. NEVER TAILGATE no matter how P.O.ed you are. 

Just use common sense, and try not to get frustrated or angry. You can always turn around and go back to something you missed. Be chill!!!

Burkys, great classic affordable burger.

"Jet Skiing you're gonna have a lot of options, because the Intercoastal Waterway is right there so people ski in there a lot, or of course the ocean.

"I used to serve on a city committee that gave recommendations to city council about pedestrian-related issues.

"I know there is/was a plan for something over by CCU along 544 for pedestrian crossing.  Some ""karens"" don't like it in the area it's being planned due to being an eyesore, and want it moved down the road a bit.  Um, the idea is to put it where people are crossing.  If you move whatever crossing measures that are being proposed somewhere else, what will happen is nobody will use it and people will still cross where they've been.

I do like the idea of pedestrian bridges.  But one thing is drivers.  They need to follow standard traffic laws.  We have traffic circles in some areas.  As you are entering, you yield to traffic already in the circle.  Yet how many times do you just see somebody zip right through that yield sign as if they have the right of way?  Sorry, but traffic already present in the circle has the right of way.  I see this near the Walmart in Market Common.  People coming off of Farrow Parkway just drive like there are no other cars on the road.

Going to another area of the county, the intersection of Carolina Forest Blvd and River Oaks Drive.  They redid that intersection.  And if you're making a right from River Oaks to CFB, you have your own dedicated lane.  There is always a right green arrow, because it will turn red when somebody is using the cross walk from that little island they have right there.  If you are coming from the Food Lion/gas station side, and crossing over River Oaks, it's only 1 lane to cross, and you will be in the left most lane heading down CFB.  And yet people just ignore other cars and cross over the solid white line.  Last I learned, the solid line meant you don't cross, you don't pass, you stay in your lane.  

Lets stay with CFB, but go to the other end at 501.  I won't even touch on the horrible part by Kroger.  But if you're on the other side of 501, it's W Perry Road.  If you're there crossing over 501 to CFB, both lanes go across.  There are directional arrow sign hanging.  The right lane can go across or make a right turn, and the left lane can go across or make a left turn.  But both can go across.  So I'll be in the right lane because I'm not trying to deal with the Kroger intersection, and yet people in the left lane going across don't want to deal with that either and cut across to the right lane.  While I'm still right there.  

Go up a little further, at Postal Way.  And maybe you're at CFB going to make a left into Publix area.  There is a solid white stop bar along the road.  Typical.  But if you pull up to it, you might get hit by a sedan or any normal car deciding to make a wide left turn from Postal Way.  Those drivers will look at you as if you are too close to the intersection.  And we can argue if we are, if it should be pushed back.  But honestly, when they do that, it's because it's designed to slow the drivers that are making a left turn down a bit.  And even with that, I've seen one bad accident there from 2 cars making a left from Postal Way to CFB.  Both lanes can go left.  Yet the van in the left most lane decided they controlled the road and to get in the right lane while they were in the turn still, ignoring the car that was in the right lane also making a left turn.   We can say they didn't see the car making the turn, which is obvious.  But if they stayed in their lane, paid attention that both lanes can make a left turn, then maybe the accident could have been prevented.",t2_iz2k8keg,Throwaway_inSC_79,0,1646830616.0,0,t1_hzyt7px,hzyt7px,True,SupremoZanne,t3_t9w48b,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/t9w48b/i_know_of_two_people_who_died_from_an_automobile/,"I know of two people who died from an automobile hitting them in Myrtle Beach between the years 2010 and 2014.

"I lived at cape landing for  about 3 years and moved out recently. They have a huge roach problem. I didn't even cook food the last year I was there because of it. It just felt gross.  I have heard from some residents in the newer buildings that the roaches are present but far less common.

Other issues I faced was my ceiling leaking which they took a month and a half to fix at which point I couldn't use my kitchen if I wanted to.

I have also had a bird come through my dryer vent and now my new dryer has a permanent smell to it.. I complained and they refused to do anything for me after 2 months of them ignoring me. They fixed the vent after a few weeks on my unit but ignored the fact that lots of other units had broken or non existent ones.

Related to the holes in the building I have had squirrels and birds living in the ceiling which also took them another month to resolve.

During the beginning of Covid they were almost impossible to get in touch with because they never pick up the phones, selectively respond to emails and didn't let anyone in the building.

They constantly switch management companies which causes a lot of confusion between the office staff and residents. My guess is the owner wants the property to be looked at more favorably but doesn't actually want to spend any money to fix the huge issues.

My advice.. STAY FAR FAR AWAY unless you don't mind dealing with shit management to save some money.

"Sending a hug from afar.

For friends, I would try Meetup. There are all kinds of interest groups on there. Just show up, do the thing, and be kind and helpful. You'll eventually make some friends.

For education, go to the local community college career center. They will be able to assess your strengths and point you in the right direction to get a job that will suit you. Now there are so many online courses and non-traditional paths to success. The most important thing is a job that supports your mental health. For instance, it sounds like a busy high-stress restaurant job is not something that would be good for you. 

I would also look into some self-care stuff like meditation or breath work. It sounds like you carry a lot of stress in your body and feel like you might explode. There are tools to help improve your mental health. Exercise, meditation, yoga, breath work can all help.

I’m not sure what hospital you are going to be working for, but when my husband & I moved last year ours hooked us up with a lovely realtor whom we adore.

"Walmart overnight shift starts at a higher rate. Plus, they have a program called live better u! And it’s free to get college degrees. Options are limited but if you wanted to go for every degree or certification on there you can at no cost! Call up to your Walmart that is closest to you and ask to speak to whoever is in personelle. Most work 8-2ish. Walmart starts out at 13/hr and o/n shift gets 14.50. Every year you can get a raise. As long as you go and do your job, you’ll be okay. Management can be a tough cookie sometimes but Walmart offers health plan, mental health help also! I think minimum is 6 months of employment and a certain amount of hours each week! Definitely look into this. It’s a decent paying job considering it’s nothing but a tourist town here. But for a job to offer help, meds, therapy and college for free is pretty good. But def call personelle at your local store. Just ask them questions or see if they can email you something regarding everything. But I understand where you’re coming from, as I struggle myself. I have for years but I’m able to say now I’m med free and don’t do therapy. It will get better! I’d say waccamaw mental health too but they have a interview process and this hoop and that one and it was discouraging for me in all reality. But find a hobby, take care of yourself.  Get a skincare routine. Something simple but something to take care and pride in YOU! you are worth every second on this earth. You were out here for a reason and you just haven’t found it yet.

If you want to get a higher education, have you thought about working somewhere (either ft or pt) that does tuition reimbursement? walmart does it and pays 100% now, as long as you work there at least 1 day a week and it has quite a couple of degree options to choose from plus trade schools and shit like that. But from what I've heard, the walmarts around here aren't the greatest and/or the position you choose def matters. Ik there's other workplaces that do it, but Walmart is the only one i know of off hand.

and another thing (if you're able to, ofc) i can suggest to get a pet. my mental health has deteriorated a lot to the point where i've been considering s\*icide, so i said fuck it and got a pet to take care of (a leopard gecko specifically). Maybe even something small like a fish or a hamster, something where you don't have to do big things to take care of it (like taking a dog on walks everyday, etc) every single day beyond feeding it ofc. I can even suggest a nice little pet store in north myrtle for you to go to that has generally cheaper animals that are better taken care of than at petco and shit.

As for friends...it ain't you.  Friends are hard to make down here unless you have a certain kind of personality.  Most people here are family oriented and tend to stick to people they grew up with.  I'm an older, straight, cis male guy, so I'm probably not much fun (don't have much in common with you) and therefore most of the gay people I know are *also* older guys.

"I am a real estate agent in the area and I would suggest renting first, even if its a 3 month rental(shocker).  There are so many different types of areas and if you are not familiar with MB at all then I would not lock into a neighborhood until you know what it is like to live here. If possible, come down for a week or two and that will give you better insight as to what you might like. If you didn't have kids I would say hey just do it, but I think with 2 kids you need to have a feel for what you are buying into.

This is just my opinion based on what I see day to day. A lot of people do move here without ever visiting and love it but now that MB has literally doubled (including traffic, houses, and school population), I suggest doing your own due diligence.

I would also say when it comes to buying, please interview your real estate agent and do not just click the box on zillow that says ""I want an agent to call me"". Call a few local brokerages and ask some questions. After all, you are trusting this person to handle one of the biggest purchases in your life you are allowed to interview them.",t2_6aenyjyx,drea900,0,1646269485.0,0,t1_hz4gyz1,hz4gyz1,True,twogreenturtles,t3_t5ah91,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/t5ah91/family_looking_to_move/,Family looking to move,/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/t5ah91/family_looking_to_move/hz4gyz1/,7,r/MyrtleBeach,0,7

Socastee and Carolina Forest are set further inland but are still heavily trafficked by tourists in the summer.

Our family has a summer house on Pawley's Island (it's below Murrells Inlet) and it's quieter. Still has tourists, but it's an older crowd.

"As far as dogs on the beach, each area has their own rules regarding dogs.  For [Surfside Beach](https://www.visitsurfsidebeach.com/beach.html)

>Animals: Dogs or other domestic pets are not permitted on the public beach during the period between May 15 and September 15.

There is an article from [2020 on WBTW](https://www.wbtw.com/news/grand-strand/surfside-beach-will-allow-dogs-on-the-beach-in-the-summer/) that says:

>Similar to this rule in Myrtle Beach, dogs still won’t be allowed on Surfside Beach between 10 a.m and 5 p.m. Before, dogs were only allowed on Surfside Beach between Sept. 15 and May 15. 

That does seem to be contrary to Surfside's own website, but perhaps that was only for the 2020 year, as the article does mention the pandemic.

[Myrtlebeach.com](https://www.myrtlebeach.com/myrtle-beach-area/beach-laws/) does seem to have more information regarding pets on the beach

* **Myrtle Beach** – Dogs on Beach

>Dogs in public must be on a leash at all times. Dogs are permitted on the beach anytime from Labor Day through April 30. No dogs are allowed on the beach from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. May 1- Labor Day. Dogs must be on a leash 7 feet or shorter at all times. Owners are responsible for picking up and   
disposing of pet waste.

* **Horry County** – Dogs and Horses on Beach

>Animals are not allowed on the beach from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. May 1 – Labor Day.   
Any animal on the beach must be on a hand-held leash not to exceed seven feet in length and under the control of the person having custody of the animal. Horses are allowed on the beach from Nov. 1 through Feb. 28 in the designated equestrian zone south of Myrtle Beach and north of Surfside Beach. Owners are responsible for picking up and disposing of their animals’ waste.

* **North Myrtle Beach** – Dogs on Beach

>Dogs must remain on a leash no longer than 7 feet at all times. Pet owners are   
responsible for picking up and properly disposing of pet waste. 

* **Surfside Beach** 

>Dogs are not allowed on the beach at any time May 15-Sept. 15. Riding horses on the beach is prohibited.

* **Georgetown County** 

>Horses are not allowed on the beach March 15-Sept. 15. Riding horses on Pawleys Island or Huntington Beach State Park is prohibited year round. Dogs are allowed on public beaches if accompanied by the owner or keeper and under the physical control by means of a leash or similar restraining device, or under the control of a responsible person to whom the dog is obedient on command. On Pawleys Island beach, dogs must be on a leash May-October. At Huntington Beach State Park, dogs must be on a leash at all times. In areas designated for the protection of endangered species, dogs and cats must be on a leash at all times.

"Like others have said, those numbers do get skewed due to a population increase in the summer months.  Double or triple the normal number of people.

And we're a tourist destination.  That brings its own inherent issues like any tourist destination.  But Carolina Forest is not the same as the City of Myrtle Beach.
Which is a point to bring up.  You will see in the news of the city's parking decal program.  Thats for residents of the city.  Carolina Forest, despite being zip code 29579 and having Myrtle Beach written as the address, is not city limits, so anybody living there, the Farm included, is not a resident of Myrtle Beach, but rather of unincorporated Horry County.

But to go back on track, CF is not exactly a quick hop skip and jump from Ocean Blvd, where most of your touristy crime would take place, if any.  Because its not like its crime ridden.  Always be aware of your surroundings.  Complacency is what gets people into trouble.  Complacency that you can leave your purse and laptop in your unlocked car.  Im not saying you shouldn't be allowed to, as yes people should mind their own business and not try to get in people's cars.

"Can't speak for The Farm specifically, buy Carolina Forest is pretty safe.  There's always incidents of people going into cars.  But in those cases, it's always somebody left something of value inside the car, and left it unlocked as well.  Most people have some sort of camera system like Ring or Blink along with some motion sensor lights.

Traffic, it depends on the time of day, honestly.  At any point out of Carolina Forest, you have to get on 501 or International Drive.  Or, since you would be in the Farm, River Oaks down to 501 and just keep going to 17 or cut over to 31 down there.  Since there are these bottleneck areas, it can get relatively congested.

"Simply Southern is quite awesome. I haven’t been there in a few years though. (I don’t live local)

I went to Captain George’s last week and was disappointed. However, I’m not a seafood eater, but I’d seen such a favorable review on their non seafood stuff that I had to try it. The food was fine, but none of the thing I had were leaving me thinking “wow this is the best version of this thing I’ve ever had!” which came into okay later when I got the bill. 

It was $115 for two people. And we only had soft drinks, no alcohol. To top it off, my gf is a vegetarian! She probably ate $5 worth of food! 

Part of it was my own fault, i didn’t ask how much it was before hand and truth be known, it wouldn’t have stopped us from eating there.

"My husband, my 2 toddlers and I moved from NYC to The Farm in December 2021, so we’re still new to the area.

Only things we’ve been warned about but I believe it’s a SC thing are black bears. If you leave open containers of food out, you’re basically inviting wildlife into your backyard. Another issue that someone else mentioned in the comment thread is to make sure you lock your car doors as there are random people that will come and check but that’s something we’ve always done I don’t understand why people wouldn’t already do so. 

The community is creating more events that will be on the Farm Activity Committee calendar. Lots of family fun activities for all ages.

"Although I did just notice that you did say WiFi.  I'm with HTC for home internet as well, but for WiFi I use my own personal router, not theirs.

I know you mentioned that your service is fine when you are home.  That may be because you are actually connected to your home's WiFi network.  But you mentioned when you drive around you're WiFi connection is terrible.  That may be because if you are near your home, it's still trying to connect just a bit.  I can get a connection to my home network down the street.  Just enough that the WiFi symbol is still showing up on my phone, but not enough to get a connection.  That's because I'm down the street.

If I turn off WiFi, or just keep driving, it looses that signal, as it absolutely should (WiFi is not designed like that), and since I am then connected to the cellular network, I'm able to do everything.

Try that first.  Turn off WiFi on your phone when you get in the car and see if that improves.  It could be that your phone is trying to access all the personal wifi networks that are around when you kinda need to be stationary for that.

Or, you're 100% confusing WiFi for Cellular and don't know the difference.  I did some chat troubleshooting support for an internet company.

"The police in Myrtle Beach are petty. Simple Possession of Marijuana, according to MBPD policies, is a mandatory arrest. Not a ticket or summons, an arrest. Public intoxication is something they also hammer. (Look at MB p2c online to see what people get charged with)

If you’re going to drink under 21, stay in your hotel room (or on the balcony and stay QUIET)

Also, sleeping on the beach after hours, (aka being homeless) is something they’ll also arrest people for. 

Spring break is a busy time down here, and those are just some examples of how low the barrier is to go to jail here, so be smart, be quiet when doing “illegal” things. (Underage drinking). You won’t be the only ones under 21 drinking obviously, but still. As others said, if you’re gonna break the law, only break one at a time.
