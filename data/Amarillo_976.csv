"> Bill *paid* automatically here

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

"People don't just have sex for procreation. Many humans and animals have sex for pleasure and bonding. I do so as safely as possible. Having sex doesn't have to equate to having a child. And to further your stupid analogy, you're not welcoming a child in when you have sex unless you're trying to get pregnant. Birth control fails, rape happens, other circumstances other than having consensual sex result in pregnancy. It's not freedom from responsibility, that's absolutely daft. It's the freedom to choose what is right for her. It's moronic to explain this to an adult that hopefully pays taxes. Again, and again, and a fucking gain, banning abortions doesn't stop them from happening. Colorado has seen a 520% rise in Texas women receiving abortions and other reproductive healthcare. You really want to decrease the number of abortions, make birth control as cheap an accessible as possible.",t2_3xae19mg,TheUnhappyKumquat,0,1647993465.0,0,t1_i1qbyx2,i1qbyx2,False,seastars96,t3_tka4k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/amarillo/comments/tka4k4/hey_prolifers_you_guys_ready/,"Hey Pro-lifers, you guys ready?",/r/amarillo/comments/tka4k4/hey_prolifers_you_guys_ready/i1qbyx2/,1,r/amarillo,0,1

"Plainly and simply, your comparison is an odd one, and seemingly a strawman one at best. Extract a fetus at 2-5 months and see how self reliant it is, as opposed to a child born in the 3rd trimester. I think humans have some sort of romantic notion of child birth and it just isn't so. Children are born every day. Animals reproduce, plants reproduce. There's nothing special about carbon based life forms reproducing. It's not a moral thing, it's a medical procedure, that a woman should be able to elect to have if that's what she wants. And again, restrictive laws won't prevent them from happening. I'd strongly suggest enriching the lives children that are alive and astutely aware of their surroundings, with education, better, more reliable adoptions programs, and social economic programs to help families with children in poverty. Regardless, it seems that we just won't see eye to eye on this topic. Which I will always find it absurd that people would care to restrict and potentially endanger the bodies and health of adult and teen women, but want to argue about the moral ambiguity of what goes on inside said woman is their business.

"So to start the Housing market in Amarillo is weird. Since the Population pool is bumping around the 250k mark and the amount of property available on the market reflects that which is to say it's not big, which allows the housing market to easily follow the current real estate trends. I think one of the issues is the uptick of out of town property investor's that buy rental property sight unseen which keeps the market here fairly hot.

Neighborhoods here are very polarizing as neighborhood housing quality changes from block to block. But typically NE Amarillo is lower income housing SW Amarillo has middle to upper income. The Area around Amarillo College has the elite million dollar homes (and some of the best Christmas lights). SE Amarillo is a mix of middle to low income. Bushland is middle and upper income.

Crime is artificialy inflated in Amarillo, most of what we have is non violent crimes which keeps the crime rate fairly high, breaking and entering, car theft (people still leave cars running in the parking lot of the gas station to get things) violent crime gets inflated here as it's always a big news story as it's not the normal around here.


And our location is a prime transient city location so we do end up having quite a few homeless especially around the Downtown areas near the service centers for them. It's a thing you either get used to it and understand it or you don't 🤷‍♂️


Amarillo does have an elite class the typicaly revolves around the Cattle and Farming industry and real estate dealers and financial consulting for them along with businesses that service them.

The art and music scene is fairly decent for a town this size. Supringly we pull quite a few big shows every year, as a pass thru city, if our facilities can accommodate a Broadway show or such they usually stop here for 2 or 3 days worth of shows  as they pass thru on their way to Albuquerque, OKC or Dallas.

Which brings us to location, we are the middle of nowhere basically. But you can weekend in Albuquerque/Santa Fe, Dallas, OKC,Tulsa, Colorado Springs, Ruidoso all places within 4-6 hours drive. 

We have Palo Duro Canyon, and Caprock Canyon and multiple Parks in New Mexico and Oklahoma that are great for weekend camping. Lake Meridith is a Federal park just north of town and the Alibates Quarry .

School districts are decent and basically you have your choice depending if your in Amarillo or Canyon. 
Homeschooling is pretty strong in the Amarillo area but most of your group resources are heavily Christian based but there are some strong secular homeschool groups in Facebook.
Amarillo college is a fantastic resource for local,. They are very involved in the community. They actually have programs for high school graduates to attend for free for 2 semesters to figure out what degree program they want to try.
West Texas A&M is a full fledged college and has extension into Amarillo with the main campus in Canyon.
Texas Tech has a vet school here also (minus the Raider rash 🤣)


Canyon fwiw is a completely different discussion thread.

Internet access is good to poor depending on location. We have Suddenlink cable with some places having gigabit cable internet, Vexus and At&t have fiber internet if they service you neighborhood. All have their plusses and minuses. (Suddenlink has poor customer service, but if your tech knowledgeable and self reliant they are passable)

As for TV options I know we have multiple broadcast channels available  but I stream everything so can't help there.

Seasons - we have all 4 seasons winter is brown summer is green fall and spring are a mixed bag of strong storms. So we have many more good days of weather than not so when we have ""bad"" weather it tries to make up for it with heavy heavy rainfall with flash floods (take this into consideration when buying a house we have hills so avoid anywhere that is the bottom of a slope)  and hail storms on the regular. Our winter storms also come out of Colorado so we do get snow often enough, but winters are dry. Tornados tend to stay north or south of the city. We are very dry over winter so wildfires are a very real threat outside of the city, but the A&M forest service is amazing in their abilities to respond to fires.

Entertainment- we have affiliated (Dbacks) Double A baseball (the stadium is a political hot topic for some) the Sod Poodles which sells out on the regular for weekend games. There is a development league Hockey team, also Indoor Soccer and I think Indoor Football team.

We have the Downtown convention center which seems to host a thing every weekend. From craft shows to Yellow City Comic Con, to Make a Wish Car Show (best vintage car show I've ever seen) also Crime Stoppers Car Show, The Farm and Ranch show and Working Ranch Rodeo (sold out every year) and more. 
Also Tri State Fair grounds has our yearly 10 day Fair and Rodeo along with the Color rodeo (which includes a longhorn drive thru downtown) 

Amarillo Zoo is small but cheap to visit.
Botanical gardens are nice and inexpensive also.
Several disc golf courses in the city parks.
Wonderland is a cute but fun amusement park.
Various Splash pads and play structures around the city at parks.
A brand new million dollar swimming complex at Thompson Park (that's a political hot button but it's there)
Amarillo college has an Art Museum.
West Texas A&M has a history museum that should be visited.

And we have independent restaurants coming out of our ears it's seriously  silly (I mean silly silly I have a top 20 and not one chain restaurant) The hype around new restaurants opening is stupid also. (We don't have Jack in the box and Fuddruckers went under this year)

As for groceries Albertsons is here as United supermarkets (each location is slightly different) and also as Market Street (the mega store) and Amigo's the ethnic leaning version. Walmart is available and I guess fits some budgets better.
There are two independent groceries Fiesta Foods (tiny good prices fresh tortillas) and Market 33 (good wine selection) 
Also there are many ethnic Asian  groceries available the biggest being Tri's on the North side is about the size of a typical Albertsons/United a stuffed full of import food. Many more places on the West Boulevard.
Pinkey's and M&R liqour stores are our versions of Specs

"Awesome! Great info thanks so much. I try to stay out of politics because that’s such a mess these days but I’d have to say I hold a lot of conservative values. God, guns, country 😂 and all that. Haha. The fact that Amarillo is positioned in such a prime location for travel definitely is one of the selling points for me. I take a motorcycle trip every year and moving there puts me like an hour or so from the Colorado border. Pretty enticing. Weather and people are two of my main concerns to be honest. Weather in the sense of I’ve heard horror stories about the wind there haha. I’ve been in many a sandstorm over seas and I hope it’s not THAT bad. Haha. I know it will get pretty hot but Texas is pretty hot all over 🤷🏼‍♂️ the people thing I worry about more than that. We’ve been pretty reclused here south of Austin because I have a real hard time being around a lot of people. Just a condition I live with now and there’s nothing you can do here without a crowd. It’s all but ruined our lives because most of the time we feel stuck home and that stinks when you have two kids who want to go out and do things. Basically I’m worried about the amount of people moving up that way, even though I’m sure it’s not the scale moving here. 
We’d kill for a few acres of privacy, to be able to put in a pool and have peaceful bbq’s, be able to make friends, etc etc etc. stuff we can’t really do here. We aren’t the, park the truck and walk around the city on a Sunday kind of people, we have more rural roots.

"Amarillo is not a big city by any means, which means that there aren’t as many entertainment options. I think you said in other posts that that doesn’t bother you. Mind you, Amarillo has some great things to do, just not a as many options. 

One of the best features of Amarillo is how easy it is to leave lol. You’re within a 6 hour drive of lots of really cool places. 

The weather here can be kind of rough. Lots of very windy days. Very little rain. No humidity. It’s very dry, and there aren’t many trees. It can be very hot and very cold. It’s not bad, but it’s not ideal. 

It seems like some things in town are cheaper than you can get them anywhere else in the country. Other things seem to be more expensive. Overall cost of living is on the low side (really low compared to Austin). 

It’s a very conservative city. The vast majority of people are incredibly nice, but you certainly run across people who will espouse their political opinions freely.

The private school options are very lacking. The vast majority of families send their kids to Amarillo ISD schools. Full disclosure, I work for AISD. The schools are fine. 

Public transportation isn’t really a thing here, and it’s not a walking or bike friendly city. You pretty much have to drive everywhere.

"My dad moved out to bishop hills 10ish years ago. Previously he lived in canyon. They love it, and yes there is very little crime due to its distance from town and layout (one way in, one way out). It’s not a bad drive to get into town either, and based on your other comments, I can see y’all being happy there. 

I grew up in SW Amarillo, lived in Austin for a while, and moved back to Amarillo. I lived in wolflin initially upon returning; it’s got so many beautiful and unique homes, but even on one of the nicer streets there was so much crime. Lots of car break-ins, a home invasion a couple doors down, I came home one night to a homeless man asleep on my porch and my garage was detached so I had to call my then-boyfriend to help me get into my home safely. Quickly moved back to sw and haven’t had any problems. Or like others have said: bushland, between Amarillo and canyon, even Timberlake/Timbercreek area.

I’m not totally sure what school district BH is, but if it’s bushland, it’s a great school district. 

I haven’t noticed a lot of people moving in from out of state like I did when I was in Austin, but the city is still growing rapidly. Traffic is so much worse than it used to be bc the infrastructure wasn’t designed for it (though it is so so so much better than Austin’s gridlocked streets and highways). The bigger issue with traffic is that people aren’t used to driving in it, get very frustrated, and drive stupidly. I have so many more complaints about the quality of everyone’s driving than I did in Austin! 😂

"Uh To each there own.  The town is in fact run by Walmart that’s why your  options for Groceries are as limited as they are. You can either shop Walmart/Sam Club or United SuperMarket. No Safeway no Frys no Albertsons none of it. Yes I realize that a lot of them are owned by the same conglomerate. Clearly you’ve most likely have never lived anywhere else where you can choose between 4 or 5 different grocery chains. 

The TV market is very limited OTA broadcast options are way less here than what you would have in a bigger market. 

I don’t have a problem with either gas station I mentioned but there is a difference. If you been to a QT recently with there new store layouts you will understand. 

As for Amazon, consider yourself lucky. Tell me your secret bc in the past year it has always taken my stuff 3-4 days or more to get delivered. I must be spoiled since before I could get my stuff same day or next day also Amazon doesn’t offer Amazon pantry here. Hopefully that changes with the warehouse.

"I moved here about a year ago from AZ and am moving back shortly. I think if I had to do it all over again I probably would’ve gone to Lubbock. House prices are similar but I hear it’s more of a city instead of a drive-thru town. 

This town is run by Walmart. So grocery stores are very limited. Shopping in general is pretty limited. Toot n totem and Pak a Sak are the main gas stations here in town so there’s no QT or circle K. As others have said Amazon is supposedly finishing up a warehouse but from what I’ve read it’s way in the east side. Most of your housing is on the west side. Hopefully prime will actually be worth it once they get here. I have prime and have yet gotten anything delivered in 2 days like I’m supposed to. The TV Market is the worst. You really need to have cable or all the streaming services.  This town isn’t for everyone by any means. 

Edit: Almost forgot the water here is horrible. I have a lab mix and the tap gave her the runs. After 300 bucks at the vet I switched her to bottled water and she got better real quick. 

If you’re looking for a quiet sleepy town and are a fan of the Walmart then this is the place for you. 

If you want to at least have options then I would look more to Lubbock. 

I read you’re a disabled marine. So the big plus for Amarillo would be the VA Hospital here is by far the best I’ve ever been to. No waiting 4+ months for an appointment with your primary care.

Unknown comics near the mall deals in miniatures as well but I never see anyone there playing (I don't go to game shops that often maybe every few weeks).

If you're in an industry where your income depends on the charity of others you really don't have the ability to demand a particular level of charity.

How am I supposed to tip for a service I have not yet received?  The tip is for the extra level of service not just the mundane.  This determines that I can only tip afterward.

My expereince so far with rideshare has not led to believe that a tip beyond a couple bucks is necessary.  My experience with delivery services has convinced me to use only the establishments delivery service or go pick it up myself.  I've yet to receive a correct order, been given service that warrants a tip, and thus far experienced a ""that's not my job"" attitude.

"Specifically, there was a clash between the preppie kids and the punk rockers in the parking lot of Western plaza, a shopping mall that used to occupy the land where Burling Coat Factory and all those stores, hotels, and offices are now.

Whelp, I do my best not to get into heated exchanges on Reddit. You don't seem heated so I will do my best to respond. 

The original post was about a bunch of teens (kids) who don't have the common decency to throw their trash. I responded to the original poster (op) stating it was wrong an how it would be great if we had a recycling center. 

You responded to my post asking how a redneck was suppose to use it. 

I assumed because you commented on my post and not the OP you were referring to the recycling center service (the service I mentioned). 

...hope we're caught up.

I agreed traffic an driving in this town is awful. people either do 10 under or 10 over the speed limit. Not sure how it will ever improve. 

As for your comment about something growing on you an wanting to try it. We're you referring to hunting? If so, I say go for it. There are plenty of people who wouldn't mind introducing it to you.

"I worked at Pure Water in Canyon for awhile and it’s the same thing.

Most of your day, when you first start out, is going to be filling up cups with tea. But people have some crazy orders with all the flavors and what not. You’ll need to remember where the tea is in the line-up of teas and how to quickly pour it to avoid it getting too foamy. It is a drive thru after all, and texans don’t like waiting for tea. I’m sure after you manage that, they will move you to filling up gallons of water for people. After that, brewing tea. Brewing tea is simple, I’m sure they just use the same brewing machines at each location.

You will be required to do a lot of heavy lifting at the store. Carrying out 5 gallons of water and throwing them in the back of trucks can be a great workout. You will get wet. You will get tea spilled on you. You will have to clean up pools of sticky tea. I know some of the bigger stores in Amarillo also have other things to buy, so you’ll need to learn basic cashier practices too, but it’s super easy.

"My experience was similar. I only get 300mb on a good day, but frankly that's always the case with internet. I was paying for 300mb with Suddenlink but only getting 100mb tops. I also had issues with them burying the line. They said they were going to bury it in a week, they didn't come. I called, they sent a guy who somehow installed a second line that went nowhere. I called again in a few weeks to ask WTF and they finally sent someone to remove the extra and bury the original.  

 I also do get periodic dips in speed during peek hours or high latency that disconnect me from online games, so I'm not as happy as some people in this thread.

     But ... I didn't ask what what was goin to go IN to their 2-story anchor store after they moved out; so... this is refreshing news!  Hopefully, it will also prompt more smaller businesses to come in to the several other smaller available vacant spots that are scattered along the hallways of WGM.",t2_8j8hw4g3,KrisJBeaty,0,1645821449.0,0,t1_hyfe805,hyfe805,True,jmbrinson,t3_t1dfg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/amarillo/comments/t1dfg2/old_sears_buildingdillards_update/,Old Sears building/Dillards update,/r/amarillo/comments/t1dfg2/old_sears_buildingdillards_update/hyfe805/,2,r/amarillo,0,2

"I don’t know what makes you think no one goes to the ball park. Season tickets are sold out and most nights you can only purchase lawn seats. The ball park owners pay the city around $450k per month and have a 30 year contract if I remember correctly. They paid this even during the shutdown. 

They city council has attracted Buc-ees, Amazon, and the cheese production factory. For an employment of around 1000 people. Jobs that weren’t here before. 

I have one kid that graduated from a private school here, one from Tascosa, and one from Amarillo High, and nieces and nephews that graduated from Tascosa. They all went on to a four year university and are productive members of society. 

I have lived here for a long bunch of years. Amarillo has met the needs of myself and my family at every stage of their lives. Sure, it’s not NYC or Dallas, but it still has its advantages over those huge metroplexes.

"I have celiac- so these places will all have options! 575 for gourmet-type local pizza, drunken oyster for an upscale dinner, Brent’s cafe has a blend of Texas and New Mexican diner type food- and literally everything can be made gluten free! Torchy’s is good- the gluten free menu has a lot less choices but I love the Baja shrimp tacos and the guacamole! We like cask and cork for a nicer dinner- especially if the weather is nice to sit on their rooftop patio. Downtown the barfield or crush are great.

"DO NOT MOVE HERE!!! There is multiple reasons not to move here, such as an idiotic City council that spends taxpayer money, on a ballpark nobody ever goes to, while not working on roads and not wanting to spend any money on basic maintenance. Second reason. The city culture is a dumpster fire. This would be the result of having not one. But two prisons, so you get the absolute bottom of the barrel people, who move to Amarillo to visit their drug buddies in prison. Third reason. BORING. ABSOLUTELY BORING! If you're not a meth or heroin addict, you can enjoy activities such as, going to a bar and getting shot, or shopping... That's it that's all there is to do in Amarillo. Third reason. The schools in Amarillo are no more than over age daycare centers. I talked to a girl who went to Tascosa high School, and she didn't know who Richard Nixon was. Now I know what some people are going to say 'oh that's just a bad teacher' but if a school board is dumb enough to hire the son of a bitch. Then they're to blame as well.

"**[FirstBank Southwest Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FirstBank_Southwest_Tower)** 
 
 >FirstBank Southwest Tower is a 374-foot, 31-story building located in Amarillo, Texas, United States. Formerly known as SPS Tower, Bank One Center, Chase Tower, and Amarillo Tower, it is the tallest building in Amarillo and the West Texas region.
