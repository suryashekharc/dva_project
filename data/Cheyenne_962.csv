If you can, try and live near the greenway, a 40+mile long bike/walking path that winds around the city and all of its parks.

Flash floods happen, so try not to live at the bottom of hills, but the drainage systems are pretty good in town. 

The further north you go, the higher the wind damage to property. The further south, the higher hail damage. (Based over last 20 years). There are parking garages downtown to hide nice cars in during hail if you have no other options. Try to live within 30 minutes of Dell Range, and you should be fine.

Lions park has many lovely attractions. The ampehetire, event center, pool, botanical gardens and children's village are all there. Not to mention its right next to rodeo land.

Do Not Live on Dell range, Pershing, 19th, 21th or 18th if you want to park more than one vehicle near your house. Parking is also limited along 1st to like 8th Avenue.

"I moved here a little over two years ago with my wife (early 30s) and we have enjoyed our time here quite a bit. Cheyenne itself is definitely growing and Fort Collins is an amazing college town with tons to do just 45 minutes down i25. Denver is only 1.5 hours down i25 (on a good day), so city activities are well within reach. 

We love the outdoors and that was a big reason why she ranked Cheynne #1. Rocky Mountain NP is only 2 hours away, so easy enough for day trips. Snowy Range is closer and far less busy. 

Cheyenne itself is clean and most people I come in contact with are genuine and kind. Obviously YMMV, but after living in NYC it was closer to home (Vermont) for us. Events downtown quite often. Art, music, and shows are abundant and continually growing.

There is plenty of camping, hiking, Mt biking in the area.

"I would amend that persons comment to say that you should keep provisions in your car if you're traveling. There's a lot of empty space between towns here and that's where you risk getting stranded in your car. If you're just commuting around town, you won't be stranded for that long without help. The weather forecasts are good enough that you'll have plenty of warning before a major storm hits.

That being said, it's obviously much colder here than Oklahoma so make sure you have good winter coats and boots. I would also recommend snow tires on your car during winter. 

I don't know much about the artsy scene, but if you like outdoorsy stuff, Wyoming is great! Hiking, camping, fishing, hunting, skiing, you name it we got it.

"The ""bad"" part of town is on the south side, but honestly the ""bad neighborhoods"" aren't really that bad. Lower income mostly, but crime is pretty low no matter where you go. The schools on the south side aren't quite as good, but they're not terrible. New construction is mostly on the north side, so if you're looking to buy a newer house, that's where you'll want to look. The only thing I would recommend avoiding is a commute that requires you to drive on the interstates to get to work. The roads in town usually get plowed decently but the wind often creates white-out conditions on the highways that requires WYDOT to close them pretty regularly. You'll be better off staying in town or close to town.

Ironically, the complaint up here is that the things to do up here are too focused on families with children and and insufficiently accommodating to young adults who don't have children yet.

In my experience with toddlers, there is limited tolerance for the trek between CYS and FoCo too frequently. If I were visiting for several days, I would absolutely make the trip at least once.

"Going out on a limb here, but I believe that Cheyenne's lack is, in part, due to our culture's reactive nature.  Participating in group activities beyond basic norms is proactive, which requires several traits to be exhibited (ex: effort, imagination, pride, confidence) in a forward-looking pattern.  

Reactive behaviors are easier commitments and require little effort.  These low-effort actions are sometimes good, they allow us to feel casual.  Sometimes they are not, for example, interjecting an opinion just to be argumentative or garner attention.  

I'm with you.  It would be great to see people participating and event organizers honing their themed presentations to encourage it.

There's good news though - Cheyenne does actually have a splashpad in its downtown district and it looks like you can fit like 10 whole kids into the cage that surrounds it! And just [look at those empty streets & sidewalks](https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/upload/crm/cheyenne/splash-pad-afc3b4555056b36_afc3b5ad-5056-b365-ab71a1db8f6458c1.jpg) in the background, so much room to look at all the closed shops that are closed in the middle of the day.

But seriously let's be honest: Fort Collins fills up with Wyoming plates every night and each weekend. If you had stuff to do up there, you all wouldn't be coming down here en-mass as you do, plain and simple.

And if someone said ""there's more to do in Denver than Fort Collins"", I'd agree with them because it's true and my identity isn't wrapped up in my geographic location.

"Thank you! I'm going to have her look into the community college. It might be a better first step, especially after a huge out-of-state move. She actually thought she was applying for the local CC when she applied to the U here, so it's more at the pace she wants to go anyway. Covid really messed with her, academically. She went from having almost straight A's to having low C's, with some B's, so she isn't too keen on racing back to school. 

My husband and I are still fairly young (38) and our kids are mostly grown. We're lucky they are so on board with us up and deciding to move, mostly just because we want to. I have loved the Estes Park area of Colorado since I was a teenager and one visit out there this past summer was enough to make my husband want to move immediately. He's a huge outdoors guy, likes to hunt, and would like to get more serious about rock climbing. We're already used to cold and snow, so that won't be a shock (other than the wind). We aren't moving until employment and housing has been secured, but we honestly don't expect the employment to take long. I'm an admin assistant at a mental health clinic, so I'd probably hold off on moving until I start actively searching, but he would be employed ahead of the game.

"U of Wyoming is an excellent school about a 45 minutes drive from Cheyenne and Colorado State is about a half hour drive away in Fort Collins Colorado, but we also have a great, very reasonably priced community college, Laramie County Community College, in Cheyenne that is affordable and offers its courses around the assumption that  a student will transfer to one of those two schools to complete their education, so they all work in conjunction with each other.

I have lived in Cheyenne for 25 years, I moved here from Alaska and I have seen the town evolve so much in that time! I went from a teenager who HATED it here, to an adult who feels fortunate to raise my kids in a pretty safe town.  Cheyenne is great because we are close enough to all the fun that Colorado has to offer to the South, and then an outdoor paradise, almost completely unused by the crowds, to the north.

My oldest just graduated high school and my youngest is in 10th this year. She will be starting her junior year there. She's your regular kid- does well in school, but isn't chasing academic rigor, so as long as it's a decent school, that's what we are looking for. She wants merit scholarships when she graduates, but she really only worries about her GPA and isn't super involved in anything beyond that academics wise. 

My oldest plans on moving with us as well. She's enrolled to start in the local U in January, but based on the move, she would hold off (and get her wish to have a full year off after high school, haha) and apply to a school out there once she could apply for in-state tuition.

Finding a rental that allowed animals was the hardest part for us. We just ended up buying a place because a mortgage and rent were about the same and my house is a lot nicer/bigger than a lot of the rentals out there. I moved from Colorado and am a lot happier here overall because of the lack of people. I got a place on the western edge of the city and love how I can walk 15 minutes to downtown. I feel safer biking here than I ever did in Fort Collins which is supposed to be one of the most bike friendly places in the US. My only complaints are the wind and lack of grocery stores (unless you live on the north side of town).

"Hello! OK so I can't help you on the employment side, because I have no knowledge in that area, but I will say it can be hard to find a rental place that allows dogs with a reasonable rent.  I don't know if you are on facebook, but there is a group called Cheyenne Community Connections.  I have noticed that they post LOTS of ""new to Cheyenne"" post with lots of job and rental info, so that may be a good place to get started.

The high schools here are good, but unfortunately Wyoming keeps slashing the budget for education, so that is a factor in what they are offering compared to where ever you are coming from.  My sons both went to South High, one graduated and one is on his senior year and I have been pleased with their education so no complaints there!

Ok local politics....So yes Wyoming is a red state, but the majority of us are progressive.  The problem is, if you go off of local media sites, you would get the impression that we are all extreme conservatives because they seem to shout the loudest on all of the community forums, but please know that most of Wyoming is reasonable.  I am a Democrat and most of my family and friends are as well, so while you may get barked at by some rabid conservative online, the majority of people here are decent and stick to their own business.

"Best advice would be not to talk about politics (which is what most of us do anyways, liberal or conservative). If it weren't for the internet we'd all probably get along a lot better. We're in the middle of a Trump-centric dialogue with the whole Liz Cheney thing right now, so it's best not to even get into it. You will be in the political minority compared with MN. If you can set aside politics and focus on everyday life, life is pretty damn peachy here.

Employment in construction/WYDOT is definitely available. Check out [https://ai.wyo.gov/for-job-seekers](https://ai.wyo.gov/for-job-seekers). A lot of it is seasonal, however. CDL is a big plus.

As far as rentals go, you might be pretty hard up finding a decent place for a decent price in Cheyenne. On the other hand, if you come from a metropolitan area you'll find the cost of living quite low. Do your research ahead of time and make sure you know how far it is to town if the price seems low compared to other listings. There are three public high schools and honestly, there isn't that big of a difference in quality. There is a bus system but it's only halfway developed so be prepared to provide your kids transportation (it is not a very bike-friendly town).

"R and B Breakfast or the Luxury Diner are pretty good for breakfast. There are some.newer places like the Omlet House, but I haven't tried those. 
The state Archives have a great museum with some really cool items. It's on Central Avenue and 22nd. The Old West Museum off of Carey is also neat to see. The Botanic Garden in Lions Park, also off Carey, have some cool young kid friendly things. The Terry Bison Ranch south of town on i25 has a train (the train is a bit schetchy, but is safe) ride around to see the bison and some other animals. 
Most of the Covid restrictions have been lifted, especially for vaccinated folks. Some places may still ask for masks, but nearly everything is open back to normal hours.
Blacktooth Brewing is a new spot that's pretty good, often they have a wing truck parked outside that's amazing (Double Dubs). Accomplice Brewing is also really good and has a good menu. 2 Doors Down is a great burger joint. All of those places are downtown.

"Cheyenne is very convenient.

The snow basically clears itself here with the clear skies and dry air, it's miraculous to me coming from the Great Lakes area; as a result they do not generally salt or sand most roads, as far as I can tell.
Snow removal culture is weird here; people will clear their windows out, but the rest of the snow on cars and truckbeds just stays where it fell until it melts or falls off. Depending on the neighbourhood, your neighbours will shovel their part of a sidewalk... eventually... maybe.

"You'll dig the fishing. I don't have experience bird hunting but know that you've got a lot of options in the area, especially if you're willing to drive a couple hours. We mostly use sand on the roads in these parts but some private orgs and other municipalities around the state use salt.

As for pizza, you probably won't be too impressed with our options; this town has far too many chains for my liking. But some people like Mondello's. It's sicilian style.

"Honest opinion from someone who used to live in Wyoming. There are some very pretty parts of Wyoming.... Just not in the southeastern corner.  Weather in Cheyenne is drastic in the winter.  If you like wind, you are in for a great time because the wind in Wyoming only stops 3 times a year, and that is just to change direction. To say Wyoming is right-leaning makes you think they are reasonable with all political spectrums. This would be an incorrect assumption.  If you like dirty trucks and gun racks, this might be the place for you. If you like cowboy hats and oil fields, they have this in abundance. The food here is passable with a few good restaurants, but if you want fine dining, you will need to travel about an hour south to Colorado.  The housing market in Cheyenne is touted to be less expensive, however, it is very comparable to northern Colorado.  Cheyenne is an Air Force town, so it is a melting pot of people from all over the united states...they have a kick ass time in the summer from the Cheyenne Frontier Days. This brings in a few concerts in the summer, so if you are into country music, this is a bonus for you.  The night life is bars.... Not much clubbing going on, it's more like barstool hopping with a bunch of old cowboys. The people of Cheyenne are very welcoming, but you may have trouble being accepted short term. Shopping in Cheyenne is Walmart, samsclub, or small business owners. Better shopping 1 to 2 hours south in Fort Collins or Denver (and everything in between).  If you are tired of massive amounts of people, this is rural America.  I have family in Wyoming, and I have to prepare myself for going back in time a decade or so when I visit my mother.  Sometimes I have to go back in time to my childhood for their level of technology in Wyoming.... And I am in my 40s... I Dont mean to turn you off of Cheyenne, but I do suggest you visit there in the late spring for a week or so to see if it offers you what you want.... I hope this helps.",t2_53ehb,Mhodi,0,1619443725.0,0,t1_gvxe2mf,gvxe2mf,True,lilgurl0107,t3_mvj3hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheyenne/comments/mvj3hm/advice/,Advice,/r/Cheyenne/comments/mvj3hm/advice/gvxe2mf/,1,r/Cheyenne,0,1

"I lived in Utah which is absolutely beautiful. I lived in the Salt Lake Valley. Housing is very expensive. My rent went up every year and I couldn‚Äôt afford a decent house. This is due to the large family size there. However, UT has mountains, hiking, deserts, and 5 national parks. 
Ft Collins CO and Laramie WY are college towns, so more going on there. Jackson WY is beautiful, but expensive too. Other than 2 national parks, not much else there. 
Towns are further apart in WY. You get used to measuring distance by the amount of time it takes to drive somewhere. Rocky Mountain National Park is about 1 1/2 hrs from here. It‚Äôs better than saying 100 miles away. 
Come for a visit and check it out. You could consider Cheyenne a temporary home until you find something more to your tastes. 
I70 through CO is stunning, but expensive. Most of the young people I know that live there all share apartments to cut costs. Usually they don‚Äôt know each other before. That‚Äôs normal down there. Grand Junction CO is cheaper, but very conservative. Moab UT is something you want to check out, but it‚Äôs mostly a vacation town, so employment may be seasonable. I haven‚Äôt been to Cody WY yet, but definitely want to visit. 
Something else to think about for Cheyenne. Services are cheaper. I‚Äôm female and I haven‚Äôt paid more than 35 for a haircut. Your income may be limited in a city like this.

"I‚Äôm originally from Mississippi and I moved to the west 5 years ago, and then Cheyenne 2 years ago. So I think I can can give you a southerner‚Äôs perspective. 
Pros: 
1) no humidity. It‚Äôs the greatest thing ever. Because of this, nights are usually 20 degrees or more cooler at night. I open the window at night, and it cools the entire house. Close in the morning and I only need a small window unit in my office in the daytime. 2) low crime.  3) Less traffic. There‚Äôs only 66k people here.  4) Dark sky at night. You just have to leave the lights of the city.  5) clean air because of the winds.  6) less trash 

Cons: 1) housing is more expensive than in the south. 2) SO conservative! This is definitely a republican state. 3) anti-maskers everywhere. Probably because of item 2.  3) not a foodie town. Higher altitudes makes food a bit bland, but there are very few decent restaurants here.  4) not a lot of night life unless you just like to go to bars. 

However, Loveland and Ft Collins is not far from here. Plenty of decent restaurants there. 

The other commenter said the winds are irritating. Having grew up with almost no wind, the winds are a welcome change to me. 35 mph sustained winds with 75 mph gusts are not unusual. If you work outside, it is something to consider. 

I‚Äôm a bit older than you. However, if I knew then what I know now, I would have left the south so much earlier. I think you are doing a fantastic thing by considering a move to the west. It‚Äôs one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made.",t2_4mnjjtyh,M3l0dyP0nd,0,1619033468.0,0,t1_gvcyn6c,gvcyn6c,True,lilgurl0107,t3_mvj3hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheyenne/comments/mvj3hm/advice/,Advice,/r/Cheyenne/comments/mvj3hm/advice/gvcyn6c/,6,r/Cheyenne,0,6

"Have lived in Cheyenne all my life.  First, the wind, it gets really annoying.  You will have to try (good luck) to adapt.

Second, it‚Äôs a great city to be able to use as a gateway to various other destinations, or adventures.  Hiking is plentiful.  You will be 30 minutes from hiking.  You might also explore snowshoeing, or cross country skiing during the winter months.

"Cheyenne honestly has great dentists. The vast majority will do a great job for you, with only a couple of exceptions. 

Prices do vary, and I honestly don‚Äôt know who is the cheapest in town, but I‚Äôd steer clear of the bottom of the barrel prices. 

A few recommendations in no particular order:

Aaron Luddington at Dry Creek Dental. Aaron is a friend of mine and very honest and trustworthy. Also a good clinician. 

Ben Escobedo at Mark Rinne‚Äôs office. Also a friend of mine and good dentist. 

Randy Davis has a good reputation at Davis Dental, but I don‚Äôt know him personally. 

Dr. Brian Cochran is a good dentist and nice guy. 

I own East Pershing Dental, and I would be happy to see you as well. Our prices are around the average of what you‚Äôll find (at least that‚Äôs our goal). 

My brother owns Brookside dental, and I would obviously recommend his office, but it‚Äôs not on the cheaper end by any means, so maybe not the best fit for you. 

But really, there‚Äôs a lot of good dentists in town. I am not going to say anything negative on here about a colleague of mine, but there‚Äôs a few to avoid, so sticking to my list you won‚Äôt go wrong. There is a bunch of great dentists that I didn‚Äôt list, if you want to know about someone specifically just ask, and if it‚Äôs negative maybe I‚Äôll send you a PM.",t2_dftia,OralOperator,0,1618458401.0,0,t1_gukh8v4,gukh8v4,True,ThankYouLuv,t3_mr0z7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheyenne/comments/mr0z7h/recommend_an_affordable_dentist_in_cheyenne/,Recommend an affordable dentist in Cheyenne,/r/Cheyenne/comments/mr0z7h/recommend_an_affordable_dentist_in_cheyenne/gukh8v4/,6,r/Cheyenne,0,6

People leave their doors unlocked in my neighbourhood, and I don't think hardly anything has been stolen or vandalized here in recent memory.

Maybe my standards are just lower, but the last two places I lived were big cities in Southern Ontario, and I really don't get the frustration here.

As for stoplights, I can't really compare it, Cheyenne was the first place I was able to drive legally, and I find driving in Cheyenne as a new driver pretty low-stress. Nothing's even really far enough that the stop lights should frustrate you, and the timing on them is usually pretty good.
