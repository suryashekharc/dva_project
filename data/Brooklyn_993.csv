"Ok - so after some hesitation, posting here to show my situation. Maybe you'll hate me, maybe you're inspired, maybe it will just serve as a testimony to how different a New York experience might be. 

I'm an immigrant in US, around 40yo with a wife and now 3 kids. Guess you can qualify me as tech-bro, but in marketing. Grew up in low income household where my parents couldn't afford to give me the pocket calculator needed and all kids had for maths in school. Had to borrow mine from the teacher every day for two years but graduated with the best grades in that school. Grinded 55-60h/week for 15 years at three different tech startups as pretty early employee, two that failed and I got fired despite good performance  - and the third one finally giving a decent payday in terms of valuable stock options. For that money together with my wife's savings, we bought a 1 bedroom in a good Brooklyn area with cash and now paying 1100 in coop fee between the two of us. Before that - we lived in rodent infested overpriced rentals for many years - so I really feel for any newly grad entry level or hard working blue collar worker just trying to make ends meet. 

I'm still employed as mid-manager making pretty good money so since I share my monthly fee with my wife and not have mortgage - guess my percentage is 4.8% after tax or 2.6% pretax - voilà!",t2_56g85qfk,ms-ff,0,1648248234.0,0,t1_i24j2ol,i24j2ol,True,jae_young,t3_tmmcmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/tmmcmg/how_much_of_your_monthly_income_goes_to_your_rent/,How much of your monthly income goes to your rent?,/r/Brooklyn/comments/tmmcmg/how_much_of_your_monthly_income_goes_to_your_rent/i24j2ol/,1,r/Brooklyn,0,1

"I grew up in Canarsie, I’ve lived here my entire life. I didn’t say in my comment that ENY was safe. I said I don’t see the danger crossing over Flatlands, which as u know, essentially separates ENY from Spring Creek. 

If u visited the lovely new park, u would see that there are newly built mixed use and residential buildings all around the mall. It’s fairly safe in that area compared to, say linden and wortman, or near ur Pink houses.  Years ago, they expanded the mall beyond what was originally just gateway drive. It has family restaurants, tons of grocery and retail stores…they even opened a Dave and busters where babies r us used to be. 

I told OP that Spring Creek (formerly known as Starrett City) would be a better alternative since it’s close to where they asked and safe for the many seniors who live in their income-based housing. Also where most of their needs are in a walkable distance including grocery, post office, health providers and more. They wouldn’t even need to cross Flatlands to get to, just Pennsylvania. And if not, there are buses that can get folks to where they need to go, one that’ll take them directly to the Mall or Rockaway Parkway train station. 

If u felt unsafe as someone who grew up in the Bronx, that’s ur experience. Which is why I suggested OP take a look around the area if possible to see for themselves. Ur experience is extremely limited to taking the train here a couple of times to visit a park and a store. Mine is living here for 30 years.

OP, feel free to check it out to form ur own opinion like me and this other person did.",t2_iafyv1tg,N9neNine,0,1648219700.0,0,t1_i22kjha,i22kjha,False,Present-Drive752,t3_tkl8oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/tkl8oa/gateway_center_mall_neighborhood_for_seniors/,Gateway Center Mall Neighborhood for Seniors,/r/Brooklyn/comments/tkl8oa/gateway_center_mall_neighborhood_for_seniors/i22kjha/,1,r/Brooklyn,0,1

If you’re an especially skilled/competitive contributor who can keep a good vibe going, can get others involved, and stays positive, folks will want you around regardless of the level play. Because of this I’ve been able to jump into everything from pick-up volleyball to basketball, ultimate frisbee to cricket, and then would later join the respective league teams too.

It is true. But Five Below is taking over the space where Sally’s and part of where Modells used to be. The main Modells building is expected to be a Bob’s Furniture. 

There’s two smaller stores that are still available for lease. One is expected to be a Skechers as they put out a bid a few weeks ago. It could be where the old eyeglasses store used to be or be where Babies R Us was.

I’m disappointed that no market/grocer is interested in any of the available spaces. Best Buy used to be a Waldbaum’s and it was great.

"First off, tolls are only 12% of the MTA's budget. Second, if people are out of their cars, then they're on buses and trains paying more in fares than they did in tolls, so it would actually result in *more* funding for transit. Not to mention the fact that more riders means more advocates for more funding. And I'm not saying your mother should bike to work in December (though many people that age do, so she's either in terrible shape or you're underselling her abilities) but it should be quick and easy for her to take the bus like basically every other old person in this city already does. If few people drove the buses would be far better. 

And I am arguing for better, safer infrastructure. Car free streets, transitways, continous sidewalks, fully segregated bike lanes, pedestrian plazas, chicanes, are all safer infrastructure. It all just happens to he car hostile because driving in an urban area is about the worst thing you can do. And sure, some people have to drive for their jobs, but that number is very, very low. So unless you're driving a commercial vehicle, which I wouldn't even count as a car for these purposes, you're just a lazy, entitled clown who's actively harming his community. 

And if you've been driving since before I was born, then I feel terrible for your poor mother.

"Further commentary on the subject:
I will say one beneficial side effect of the pandemic is that delivery radii of all restaurants suddenly became much more generous. Virtually none of these park slope or ditmas (or even further) restaurants would have ever delivered to me before but ever since the shutdown in 2020 I have so many more choices.
Maybe someone out there thinks this is actually bad because it leads to the delivery people being overworked and under more pressure, or maybe decreases quality of life (more emissions or more crazy e-bike antics).

"It really depends on where you live. If you’re thinking about where to move, take a look at the subway maps while you’re looking and the nearest grocery stores and things like that. If you see that your most important things are within walking distance, then you probably don’t need a car. And anything you happen to be doing that’s a little farther, you could just take an Uber or Lyft. Cause it wouldn’t be worth it to have a car unless you’re consistently in areas where things are harder to get to. Generally, the deeper into Brooklyn you go and the closer to Queens you get, you’ll need a car. And when I say deeper, basically look at the bridges and think about fan shape from there.

"So as someone who lived in Brooklyn for 7 years and owned car because he HAD to have a car and always had a car. I can tell you that there are severe cons and pros to take into consideration.

So take a good look at your situation.

Can you financially take care of the car and can you afford the insurance and tickets you might accrue?

Is there anywhere you need to get to that doesn't have public transportation?

How close are the things you need to get to like grocery stores or any store that you regularly need to visit and stock up from?

Can you deal with the lack of parking or do you have a parking space?  Can you afford a parking space elsewhere?  How far away?

If you don't need to travel far to get everything you need to live your life, no.  You do not need a car.

If you have places that require you to travel far distances and you want to make your own schedule and not have to pay a taxi or car service, then yes.

"It depends what part of Brooklyn you’re in. If you’re in an area that’s not within walking distance of a subway, (sheepshead bay, marine park, dyker heights, etc) then you might want a car.

When i lived in dyker heights, but worked in upper East side manhattan, driving was easier than public transportation but parking in both places was a nightmare. Driving to visit family near marine park where there are no subways and running local errands was easier though. It really depends on your situation.

"Everybody’s right about the “it depends where in Brooklyn” thing, but Brooklyn is definitely the second-best borough for non-car-owners. If I lived in Flatlands or something I would own a car, no doubt about it—there’s no subway service there at all. Past the end of the line.

I still think Brooklyn and Manhattan are the two “you don’t need a car to live in NYC” boroughs, though. Big chunks of the Bronx too, obviously, as the subway ridership will testify, but whole swaths of especially the east Bronx are places where it’s useful to have a car. 

Queens is the real sorta half-and-half borough: literally, in the sense that half of the borough (maybe more like 2/3 actually?) just doesn’t have any subway service, and it’s the most post-war, car-friendly of the four non-SI boroughs.

I work in Red Hook (no train access), which is like 5 miles from my home, so 15 minutes in the car vs. 1+ hour by train/bus. And finally, my husband's family lives on the South Shore of Staten Island and there is really no other way to visit them than by car. We also drive to visit my family 2-3 times a year. So in the case of travel the car is necessary, but in all other instances it's really just for convenience. It's a small hybrid so parking and gas are not too burdensome.

"Cold and rain are nowhere near the impediments everyone (including me) thinks they are to bikes/scooting before you try it. Cold is not a barrier at all, you just put on more layers as it gets colder. You've probably been outside for half an hour in cold before. It's not hard to dress for. 

Rain is a little trickier but not much. The first thing to remember is it really doesn't rain that much here. People vastly overestimate the actual number of days is raining. How often do you actually need to bring an umbrella when leaving the house? Not never, sure, but not *that* often. and on those days you can either simply take the train or do my preferred method of wearing a raincoat or poncho, pull over ski pants, and waterproof shoes. (Vessi or boots.) I think all New Yorkers should own this gear anyway.

The short answer is yes absolutely (to the closing question of your post) I have a car here in Brooklyn only because it’s paid off and because parking is easy to find on the street where I live.

"Personal experience growing up in Bk, having a car is convenient, but not necessary. Granted, I live close to a lot of subway stops, but if I lived farther south or East, then a car would be a lot more necessary. If you need to regularly go to LI, upstate, NJ, or any other suburban area, you basically need a car. Transit in those areas is not as good, especially if you’re spending some time there.
