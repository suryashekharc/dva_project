"Things are less spread out in the city. Miami is urbanized from Kendall to Fort Lauderdale and it keeps going north honestly. Atlanta's more normal in that it has a large urban center and some pockets of cities around it (e.g. Buckhead, Decatur, Sandy Springs, etc.) so it's easier to walk around. The beltline is great, there's no Miami equivalent. MARTA can be useful too depending on your commute.

People are nicer, not like the Midwest or anything but it's better. People don't care how much money you make, I remember kids bragging about how much money their parents made in high school in Miami. That's not the vibe in ATL. Going out to bars or clubs isn't a whole ordeal like it is in Miami.

ATLs gay community seems bigger than Miami's, lots of gay bars, restaurants, residential buildings, [crosswalks](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/atlanta-rainbow-crosswalks). Gay everything on Piedmont between 10th and 14th St.

There's lots more, but I'll leave you with this last one that might be a plus or con, depending on your perspective: Miami leans a lot more into flashy consumerism/big brands with shopping malls and places like Brickell City Center or Lincoln Road. In Atlanta you have one main mall and it's 10-15 mins from midtown. You have smaller, local shops at places like Little Five Points, Krog Street Market, and even the more upscale Ponce City Market.

"Big traveling fair with the typical carnival rides, foods, shows and farm animals. Very local, mostly Hispanic crowds (with all that it entails). Fun for kids but once you get past a certain age it will all just make you sick. From the greasy food to the badly maintained rides, it’s all a health hazard. For me it’s sort of a once every 5-10 year thing where the nostalgia/boredom hits me so I decide to go back but then when I’m there I remember why I stopped going. 

Still, I won’t be completely negative. If you’ve never been or you’re new to Miami you should go at least once for the *experience*. If you have kids they’ll enjoy it and even as an adult you can make an evening out of it just by seeing the shows and the animals and having some greasy carnival food for dinner.

We're all vaccinated and got covid as well, so the fear isn't there on our side. But I do have family members that elected not to go because of that risk and I can understand as they would definitely had a bad time.

All that being said, the fair is awesome and super fun. Hasn't skipped a beat since when I had gone when I was a kid and teenager. As a parent explored the community fair expo and animal grazing more, which was pretty interesting and fun.

"Thank you for the detailed comment!! Really helpful! So it’s better to go early to get on rides because once it’s night time, the lines for them are really long?",t2_k2q26t7v,Roccstarr95,0,1648220012.0,0,t1_i22lbr9,i22lbr9,False,Roccstarr95,t3_tn9tmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/tn9tmu/youth_fair/,Youth Fair?,/r/Miami/comments/tn9tmu/youth_fair/i22lbr9/,1,r/Miami,0,1
I went last night! Was crowded! The food had all the usual fair items plus some new ones like the deep fried flan and gator Mac and cheese. They added beer and wine booths. The lines for rides got very long after 7pm. They have a lot of fun rides and the ride safety is standard for a traveling carnival venue. We arrived at 1pm and rode almost everything and saw an ice show before leaving at 10. Best advice: 1. buy the refillable cup if you are getting there in daylight because it’s hot and you will need to hydrate. 2. Bring an umbrella for shade. 3. If you are going to watch the ice show do it while it’s hot since it’s a nice air conditioned place. 4. Circus is a people-circus not animal-circus and is fun but better at night. 5. Buy your ticket online in advance and purchase the unlimited ride pass. It pays for itself after 5 rides. The $20 fast pass is not necessary. Some advice: When entering go straight forward through the games portion. This will drop you off near “kiddie land 2” but also the back end of the adult rides. Then travel left and you will do the main ride route in reverse but ahead of most of the crowd. You will get shorter lines on a lot of rides on the back end of the park. Remember all rides are in duplicate or triplicate. There are 2 crazy mouse rides. Two tilt a whirls. 3 Ferris wheels. 2 giant swing rides. The rides near the front have the longest lines.,t2_c4o7q,Slow_Snail,0,1648219868.0,0,t1_i22kypo,i22kypo,True,Roccstarr95,t3_tn9tmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/tn9tmu/youth_fair/,Youth Fair?,/r/Miami/comments/tn9tmu/youth_fair/i22kypo/,1,r/Miami,0,1

"This is the most subtly racist article I have ever read. It is basically suggesting that only Black people are behaving poorly and they are therefore targeted specifically by the city because of that. That’s some underhanded racism of low expectations.

That said, Miami Beach is wildly incompetent to control the crowds of people. Ft Lauderdale used to have the same problems back in the 80s and when they tried to go hard on enforcement and make it difficult to party, things got more out of hand and the beach area went downhill.

"Idk man I’m here for extended stay (3 months) for work, from DC, and I spent 4 years living in Baltimore. Miami is where I’ve felt safest of all three of these cities. There is far less indiscriminate violence, random violent mentally ill homeless people accosting strangers, I’ve been made to feel unsafe literally zero times in the last six weeks vs. a weekly basis in DC and almost every other day in Baltimore. I can go to gas stations here without being yelled at or have random vulgarities/slurs thrown at me (I’m white btw). I’m staying in Brickell and little Havana mostly but I’ve been all around this city and I feel better walking around here at night than I do at many places in DC and most places in Baltimore.

There’s some parts of downtown and overtown that aren’t great here but nothing compared to walking about Union station/Columbia Heights/Petworth/Navy Yard in DC or anywhere north of Little Italy in Baltimore - none of which are actually explicitly bad areas (like N. Baltimore, or Capitol Heights or SE DC).

"Yes, I’m aware of how the post office organizes unincorporated areas. That still doesn’t make that area part of Hialeah. As a matter of fact the 33015 zip code where the shooting took place doesn’t even overlap with the municipalities of Miami Lakes or Hialeah. It’s all unincorporated areas. Even when you type in the zip code on Google Maps it labels it as Miami Gardens. I’m aware this is all pedantic BS but let’s not play stupid tampoco. Why even call it the Hialeah shooting? Why not The Memorial Day Weekend Shooting or The Shooting at El Mula’s or something else. Why the need to bring Hialeah into it at all? That’s the point I’m trying to make. There are many names you can call that area that are way more appropriate and accurate than Hialeah. Plus I bet no one living in that area goes around telling people they live in Hialeah.

"We do the same for other statistics like voting.
You wouldn’t say that Miami Beach votes one way based on what people from Hialeah votes.

In this case the residents of Miami Beach are complaining that people who are not from there are committing the crimes. They are not tourists from other states, the same way they are not tourists from other countries. But they are also not Miami Beach residents (or maybe they are, but my entire point is that with that kind of reporting it’s impossible to know)

It’s a very simple concept to understand.
If you base your reasoning on your feelings on how many years you’ve been here and the fact that you think you are local, it’s completely irrelevant to how crime statistics are. Understand that we are talking about crime statistics not your suggestive perception of what a local person is.

Same with the shooting at the Hip Hop concert during memorial day weekend last year, or as Wikipedia likes to call it [The 2021 Hialeah shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Hialeah_shooting) despite the shooting not taking place in Hialeah (that part of town doesn't even border Hialeah) and many of the people involved being from the actual neighboring city of Miami Gardens. 

I mean, I understand what the media is trying to do but can they please stop trying to shift the blame to ""Hialeah"" i.e. Cubans. We've got enough criminals and crazy people already for you to try and blame more shit on us.

"A few of these comments are full of shit. 

In the last few years, a bunch of the cheaper hotels/motels got tore down and giant expensive hotels/ condos have gone up. So a lot of the college kids stay right on the beach are the ones with money. So although its a more white demo, the beach is still packed with kids drinking, being dumb and sometimes getting into fights.

Key difference between Miami and Ft. Lauderdale beach is the layout. In Ft. Lauderdale beach its really just one small strip on the beach with bars and restaurants, To go to other spots, you either go a mile or 2 north, or a mile or 2 west, to the strip on Las olas or Down Town Ft. Lauderdale. The same shit happens in Ft. Lauderdale, its just more spread out.

South beach on the other hand has multiple long streets of bars/clubs/ restaurants right next to each other where everyone can just wonder around all night. And even tho a ton of police are down there, you can still duck off and do dirt, or they miss it cuz they're all standing together in one spot talking and not paying attention.",t2_7lwna,Gen2Teg,0,1648143779.0,0,t1_i1yhb5f,i1yhb5f,False,HerpToxic,t3_tlyok9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/tlyok9/miami_beach_bans_alcohol_sales_after_6_pm_for/,"Miami Beach bans alcohol sales after 6 PM for Thursday, Friday and Saturday and Beach parking garages will be closed after 11 PM",/r/Miami/comments/tlyok9/miami_beach_bans_alcohol_sales_after_6_pm_for/i1yhb5f/,2,r/Miami,0,2

"It wont. A majority of spring breakers aren’t dropping $18 a drink in south beach. Their buying liquor and beer from the store and drinking that. This won’t change anything there. 

I work at a hotel here. Our restaurant and bar aren’t actually seeing a boom in business. But the amount of college kids in and out of the hotel with bottle of liquor, and even trying to bring them to the pool area, is massive. 

Some of the wealthier kids will go drop dollars at wynwood but they aren’t the ones that are the problem. The problem people will stay in Miami beach.

Edit: Just read the article. This only bans alcohol sale for off premises consumption. Like liquor stores, which can sell everything before 6 anyways.

"I went with my husband and daughter pre pandemic, we did the boat tour to Boca Chita Key. The park is something like 90% water, the only place drivable is the visitors center. The boat tour was a few hours, you see wildlife like dolphins and birds while on the 7 mile ride, you dock at Boca Chita Key and a park ranger leads a tour of the lighthouse there. There is a small beach area for swimming, but i remember the current being strong so keep that in mind. There are also a few trails on that Key, if you decide to explore them bugspray is a must, there's mosquitoes. I remember there being a place to drop kayaks/canoes but back then they didn't have an active vendor onsite, so you had to have your own. 
Maybe give the visitors center a call and see what they offer nowadays, but you really need to either have your own boat or take one of their tours to see any of the park.
Also, if I remember correctly, the tickets we got for the boat tour also give you free parking and entry to nearby black point park. We went there in the afternoon after the boat tour and had a late lunch at a restaurant by the marina.",t2_9ud6awik,adaptablepalate,0,1648127285.0,0,t1_i1xce28,i1xce28,True,pierretong,t3_tk3esy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/tk3esy/biscayne_national_park_ecoadventure_recommendation/,Biscayne National Park - Eco-Adventure Recommendation?,/r/Miami/comments/tk3esy/biscayne_national_park_ecoadventure_recommendation/i1xce28/,1,r/Miami,0,1

"I grew up here, moved away for a few years in my late 20s (I recommend this to any Miami lifer) and then moved back with a good job. I lived with my parents for about 9 months until I had saved up enough to get an FHA loan and put a downpayment on a 1100 square foot townhouse in Kendall. This was in 2016. Cards on the table, at that time I felt swindled paying $205k for it— the previous owners bought it at the nadir of the recession for something around $110k. The process to get my loan was long and drawn out, and the sellers put up with it because, well, it's either a three month ordeal with me or a three month ordeal with someone else. That's just what selling a house was. Today, I can't imagine a seller wanting to put up with that if there is someone dangling 12 days to closing in front of them. It sucks, but a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, and it will take a real mensch now to really consider a financed offer.

"I live in a condo in West Kendall currently. I'm very lucky bc my stepmother owns it, we've been here for 1.5 years and when we moved in, $1300 was just $50ish under market rate (it's a 2/2). Right after we moved in, the vacant ones in my complex upped to $1550 - i bet it's almost $2k/month now. Fortunately my stepmother has agreed not to raise our rent for the time being. And i know I'm lucky for that, i am. But all the rent we pay means nothing toward actually ever getting a house. And remember I'm in a 2/2? So many people in here have crammed three generations into these apartments. I only know one other couple in here in their 30s who don't live with parents or even grandparents. That's nuts. 

I hate it. My neighbors are giant assholes, they blast music so loud it shakes my walls (they are in their 60s, these aren't kids). I hate that i cant go to the doctor without a translator being called (literally, the medical assistant didn't speak English, the doctor did). I don't mind doing things in Spanish, but i shouldn't have to go to the doctor in Spanish, that's beyond my capability and could be dangerous. 

We have the most expensive car insurance in the nation (when I called, they told me my specific zip code is top 10). It just...we pay Miami prices and have Miami problems, but West Kendall has none of the benefits of actually living in Miami. 

We are going to end up having to leave, it's just a question of when. Because along with all the other issues and highly expensive bullshit, we all make Mississippi wages. I had a teaching certificate. I let it drop and i wait tables. Before the teacher's raise i was making more than teachers working less hours. Now that they've gotten their raise, they may make a couple grand more than me, probably not if we compared actual take home pay per hour and not pre tax wages.

If you like West Kendall, I'm very happy for you that you found a place here and at least don't have to rent!!! I don't wanna drag you down with my misery or anything. But you also proved the other commenters point - you just got here a year ago. We are lifelong South Florida residents that have always made Florida wages.

"Hi all, my husband & I (early 30’s) will be in Miami for the first time ever for only Friday & Saturday, & are in need of some recs.

"One of the reasons that S. FL real estate sales and rentals are so expensive is that there are many foreigners with lots of money who want to put that money somewhere safe.  Lots of rich people want to live here, or just own property here, sort of like in NYC, Vancouver, etc, and they drive prices up.

For someone whose money originates in rubles, or any other number of currencies not as stable as the dollar, owning property down here is a way to ensure their money does not lose value.  It's not just Russians at all, it's Chinese, Brazilians, Mexicans, Venezuelans, just rich folks who want to be sure their money doesn't devalue with what they know is a vulnerable economy in their country.

Those people also like to live here.

But we, regular folks who live and work here, can't compete with them.  

If those unoccupied units became available, the number of units available would rise, and simply thinking in terms of supply and demand, would probably have an impact on rental prices.  

Alternately, if they paid substantially higher property taxes, that would help with infrastructure issues as well as possibly making it easier to subsidize housing for lower income residents. [Some cities have enacted tax regulations for empty luxury apartments and as far as I can tell, Miami-Dade hasn't, but it should.]

"I've lived in South Florida for 20 years, SoBe for 15. Been everywhere, seen everything, done everything.

Consider this a lucky break, in that you'd be a fool to put down serious money in buying a house in this bubble market in this specific place with all the environmental disasters that are intensifying every year.
The next major hurricane will leave nothing but shambles and it's gonna be lord of the flies, worse than NOLA.

Curlturally, this place is also deader than dead. Grift is everywhere, you either have lazy and stupid people in control or old Florida money that oozes corruption. After the condo collapse in Surfside, they couldn't even pass some sane condominium inspection/reform laws. This place is a ticking time bomb.
