"I’d second that - my fiancée and I just moved to Cohasset from Cambridge last year. We knew we’d be taking a hit when it came to things like diversity, range of amenities like restaurants, and would be further from the city.

"Charm - yes I’d say so. There’s a nice lake with a big public beach (I think you do need to buy a pass to use it but it’s not too expensive). Lots of trees and quiet side streets. A few historic buildings here and there. A great local ice cream place (Crescent Ridge) that will still, I believe, deliver milk and other groceries to your door. Of course, there are also more boring parts - especially on the outskirts of town you’ll see more 90’s-2000’s housing developments, some small strip malls, etc.

Amenities - not sure what you mean by this exactly. There aren’t a ton of stores and restaurants in town, though there are a few of each in the town center and in Sharon Heights (south side of town). If you want to live near a bigger shopping center, Route 1 in Walpole is just over the border, and so is Cobb’s Corner in Canton. And, as I mentioned in my first comment, Sharon does have a commuter rail station that takes you into Boston via the Providence/Stoughton line.

"I grew up in Sharon and I think it checks a lot of the boxes you're looking for. Somewhat diverse (though it tends to be only certain minority groups represented - historically it's been very Jewish, and now there's a growing South Asian population). Very good schools. Lots of families with kids. Very liberal-leaning (though not as progressive as places like Cambridge). Easy access to Boston via the Commuter Rail, though it definitely doesn't feel as connected to Boston as Newton since that's on the Green Line. I really have no idea about housing prices since I've never looked to buy a home, but from what I've heard, it's a bit more affordable than the Metro West suburbs like Wellesley and Lexington.

As a kid, I complained about it all the time of course. It felt like there was nothing going on in town. But in retrospect, it really was a pretty good place to grow up. I do wish there was a stronger sense of community for families without kids/with adult children - my parents didn't find many social opportunities once me and my brother were done with high school - but you can always move out at that point (many people do).",t2_9ifmo,bazoid,0,1647275093.0,0,t1_i0mt5ft,i0mt5ft,True,Brosquad2,t3_tdmm24,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthShore/comments/tdmm24/good_towns_to_live_in_for_families/,Good towns to live in for families?,/r/SouthShore/comments/tdmm24/good_towns_to_live_in_for_families/i0mt5ft/,3,r/SouthShore,0,3
"Any of the towns mentioned are probably in the top 10% of public schools nationwide if not higher. Several of them in the top 20 in Mass. Most of them would be happy to have a mixed race family move in so they can casually mention that they're friends with a minority. This is all limousine liberal country you're talking about. And I say that without an ounce of derision. I'm grateful to live here. 

Wealthy, liberal suburbs inundate the boston metro area. If you're coming from someplace more moderate to conservative you'll be pleasantly surprised. Almost everyone here is pretty cool, comparatively. I would say factor in commute if you have one.

EDIT: I watched the whole video and it's pretty good.  As the guy says, this mall was dead even before Covid.  It never had nearly enough people.  They went in an entertainment direction with several different Dave & Busters-type venues (Formula 1 racing etc) -- I'm sure they pitched it as a Next-Generation Mall! -- but it never took off.

Even the Target there looks like it does OK business but it has a certain grimness because of the black hole of a mall through its indoors entrance.

"I got this one - I spent my 20s drinking and fucking up my teeth and ignored my dental health entirely. I had a ton to get done.  

Beyond Dental Health in Cohasset is the best dentist I’ve ever been to and I’ve been to a lot. I was terrified to go the first time but Dr Freeman was so kind and understanding and made me feel comfortable immediately. They set me up with a care plan and began tackling issues in priority order. I have a care plan and know exactly how much I need to budget to get my mouth in order.

I’ve been to Anderson in Hingham too they offer great care but weren’t as helpful on the administrative side of things from my experience.

Beyond Dental has been up front about every cent I was signing up for and makes it very clear what my insurance will cover and what I’m on the hook for long before providing service. It’s been very refreshing.

Of business for McGuire and Baird.

Met a girl who’s young heart he took,

Got married and together they’d go

To swim the river Cochato.

Years later, one day he went numb

Couldn’t feel a thing with his thumb.

The doctors all said

In a year he’d be dead!

"Sorry, I have to respectfully disagree. I can't argue about Hingham being white bread, but it is definitely not old money anymore. Many people are quite recently wealthy and many more are pretending to be but are really just in debt up to their eyeballs.

None of the towns you named have what OP is looking for. None are liberal or particularly LGBTQ+ friendly, all have drug problems and are crawling with Trumpies. Rockland probably has the worst school system on the south shore. Weymouth has a beach and that's about it. Nobody who has their heart set on Hingham would be happy in any of those places.

In all seriousness, if you're not wealthy your biggest hurdle would be finding an affordable place to buy. Depending on the neighborhood, even a tiny rickety little teardown on a postage stamp lot will cost over $500,000, and the nice houses often cost $1 million and up (again depending on the neighborhood.)

The social aspect of not being wealthy isn't as bad as people think, but I don't have children so I can't speak to any bullying that may occur in schools. I think it really depends on who you make friends with. It's like anywhere, be a good neighbor and you get what you give. Of course there are going to be a few jerks in any town.

Do you have children already or are these potential children you're worried about? Hull has most of what you're looking for except for the good schools, everyone I know from Hull says they are terrible. Hull is more affordable than Hingham, but home values seem to be rising and if the kids aren't born yet, it might be worth buying there and figuring out the school problem later.",t2_becev,Dicentra22,0,1644092902.0,0,t1_hvqjesd,hvqjesd,True,Conscious_Stretch686,t3_slectq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthShore/comments/slectq/where_to_move/,Where to move?,/r/SouthShore/comments/slectq/where_to_move/hvqjesd/,9,r/SouthShore,0,9

"If you need to build a new route to Maine and Canada from Pennsylvania that would involve hundreds of miles of new pipe. You say that they blow up all the time but you can't even find a single time that it killed someone since the 1980s. People work in them in a lot of cases and an explosion bad enough to travel the 100 yards to 3A would definately kill everyone inside. But I can't find any deaths from them, so I logically conclude that they aren't that dangerous unless I can find more information about why they are. If it's not even dangerous to the people inside why would it need to be put in a rural area?

The thing in Andover that blew up WAS NOT a compressor station. The compressor being located in Hingham vs Weymouth vs Bumfuck central mass would have no effect on what happened there. Also if you don't realize how digging hundreds of miles underground is 10x as expensive as digging dozens of miles underground you are just retarded. Please show me a compressor station who has killed someone since the 80s I would like to know this information.

"I said ones that caused deaths the whole time because that's what we are talking about. People get injured in my office by falling down the stairs. But there is nothing particularly dangerous about stairs. I actually did know that there was industrial zoned land in Hingham but having no vacant industrial land is the same thing so idk what you're harping on about. Run the pipeline around 495? I realize that there are more than 1 way you can draw a line on a map from Pennsylvania to Maine but some ways involve creating hundreds of miles of new pipeline and would be WAY to expensive to be built. So blocking it in Weymouth = it doesn't get built. And we use more oil and coal as energy than we would otherwise. You seem like you belong on the short bus honestly. It really isn't that complicated to understand that something may have some risk (compressor station) but actually be safer than the alternatives.

There you go again changing the goal posts. First it’s no compressor explosions in 40 years. Wrong. Then you’re crying about how you meant deaths. Then you say there’s no industrial zoned areas in hingham so putting it there would be illegal. Wrong. Now it’s vacant industrial zoned land in hingham. Now you’re saying to get gas from PA to ME the pipeline and compressor *needed* to be put in north Weymouth. Wrong. Run that pipeline outside of 495. If needed build two compressor stations on that route because you’re in low populated areas.

"He didn't say it was safe he was just commenting on how the location was chosen. I have restated multiple times I have no idea how safe it is and I am looking for things to read comparing natural gas to other fuels for their safety. All fossil fuels kill people, a very small percentage by explosions, almost all of it is from climate change and pollution. These aren't as sexy as the rare explosion that kills 1 person so it doesn't get on the news but their lives are just as important.  I have never lived in Weymouth but have family there and my boss actually lived in that neighborhood, my commute actually went right over the bridge in 3A so I am very familiar with the area. Calling it economically depressed is honestly just funny to me because it is clearly middle income. Maybe you have spent too much time on Newbury street or Duxbury so by comparison Weymouth looks ""depressed"" to you but by every metric it is clearly middle of the road. Also talking about the industrial land in Hingham, to my knowledge known of it is vacant. The quote from my friend was basically that it was the only vacant industrial zoned land within range to make the pipeline possible.

"you can't just fire a cop for a crime because.. due process. also.. rules. and.. union contract. rules say the trial is done by other cops. they say he is fine and can go back to work because.. blah. process is over. everything was done ""by the rules."" no other process will take place because this one is over. the rules are flawed to begin with on purpose. they are also corrupted. corruption is not a crime, simply bad work done by the cops. and that's how cop crimes get whitewashed and those who are a danger to the public continue to 'serve' and endanger the public. try to mess with it, and they sue in court. the judge is usually a friend of the lawyer/prosecutor/cop's boss/etc. and financially relies on the cops to bring in fresh meat (prisoners) which maintains the judge's court budget. if a judge doesn't send people to jail, the judge won't get the budget to pay the court employees. that's why judges have a lot of power - because of favors to cops.

but you should not confront people over a handicap spot. there is a lack of parking. sure cops abuse the parking policies, but they are a priority vehicle too. if they had to look for parking, it'd be impossible for them to work. you should instead call the cops boss and report the license plate. then you will be put on a targeted list for having your car followed and pulled over and citations issued in retaliation.",t2_b5djnzpy,sdaasdfsdfff,0,1623909706.0,0,t1_h225f2v,h225f2v,True,Pigment_pusher,t3_lu12a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthShore/comments/lu12a2/officer_ryan_ross_in_massachusetts_gets/,Officer Ryan Ross in Massachusetts gets confronted after blocking a handicap spot.

Adding my personal anecdote; I'm half Irish ancestry on my father's side. Until him, his lineage in America only married other people of full Irish descent, for well over a hundred years. My husband has more Irish ancestry that than, since his maternal grandparents were from Ireland, and it's all Irish last names on his father's side too, though I haven't been able to find who on that side immigrated. It's been difficult to get genealogical records for Irish ancestors. Even when they're online, there are so many people with the same name!

Incidentally, my former brother-in-law is Irish (a Kerryman), and found it very strange that we USians attach such significance to green for Ireland, party it up on St. Patrick's Day, and often have a boiled dinner, corned beef and cabbage with soda bread around that time.

"Researchers at the University of Ottawa would like to conduct 90-minute telephone interviews with anyone who has used mifepristone (also known as the abortion pill, medication abortion, or medical abortion) to end a pregnancy. 
 
You are eligible if you:  
Used mifepristone to have an abortion on or after January 1, 2015  
Were living in Massachusetts at the time 
Are sufficiently fluent in English to answer interview questions 
Have access to a telephone, Skype, or Zoom 
 
During the interview, we will ask you series of questions about your background, your reproductive health history, and the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy. We will also ask you to tell us about your experience obtaining an abortion with pills and we will ask you to tell us about ways in which you think that services could be improved. 
 
All participants will receive a $40 gift certificate to www.amazon.com. Participation is both voluntary and confidential. Spots for this study are filled on a first come, first served basis. 
 
Please note that the abortion pill is not the same thing as emergency contraception, also known as Plan B or ""the morning after pill."" 
 
If you would like more information about the study or research team, or if you are interested in participating, please contact us at ws-stu02@uottawa.ca.

"The Republican primary ballot was not compelling. Basically the only race was for US Senate, between a crazy person and a no-name, and it didn't matter, because neither one was going to win against Markey or Kennedy in a presidential election year in MA with Trump on the ballot.

So conservative unenrolled voters pulled a Democratic primary ballot and voted for the conservative option.

And some Republicans took advantage of the shorter voter registration window to unenroll, pull a Democratic primary ballot, and vote for the conservative option.

That's on top of the South Shore being pretty conservative.

There were other people around, and after I told them exactly where to look, they said they could see it.  

It looked *amazing* in 10x50 binoculars. Just like the pictures.  If you can buy or borrow some binoculars, I highly recommend it.  (Walmart has some [10x50's for $32](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simmons-ProSport-10x50mm-Porro-Prism-Binoculars-Black/22949592).)

"I agree, cyclists riding two abreast who don’t move over are stupid and inconsiderate. In a perfect world, they should be ticketed and fined. But as we all know, most people operating motorized vehicles while being assholes get away with stupid crap all the time too.  

As to your question “Why bike on the road?”  There are loads of reasons. Lots of people don’t have trail bikes. People on road bikes are often going too fast  for sight seers/Sunday drivers on the paved trails.  Etc.  

But at the end of the day, we don’t have to justify bike on the road.  Why [because it’s the law, and we have every damn right to be here](https://www.massbike.org/laws)Per the Mass General Laws Section 85, Chapter 11 :  “You may ride your bicycle on any public road, street, or bikeway in the Commonwealth, except limited access or express state highways where signs specifically prohibiting bikes have been posted....”

“......You may ride two abreast, but must facilitate passing traffic. This means riding single file when faster traffic wants to pass, or staying in the right-most lane on a multi-lane road.....”

We pay taxes to maintain the roads and the parks too.  And for some of us and the types of bikes we ride, the trails you refer to aren’t appropriate.

But what gets lost in that argument is bikes are not cars. The overarching goal of driving a car is to not be a hindrance to traffic. 

A group of bikers side by side are a hindrance, especially more so on a winding road. 

Also again. This isn't a city street, or a neighborhood street. It's a street through a park, that has countless miles of paved trails that connect in every area of the park. 

No one has been able to come up with an acceptable reason to be on that road. Outside of the two entrances.

"I grew up square in the middle of the Bridgewater triangle. Never saw anything spooky personally, and frankly don’t believe any of it, but here are three things friends claimed:

1. a pond in Stonehill College — friend was smoking weed and walking the grounds, heard a massive bang coming from the direction of the pond. Saw a thick fog over it, and he swears the silhouette of a man trying to drag himself out of the pond. He freaked and ran a few steps in the opposite direction, and when he turned back, only the fog remained. No explanation for the bang. 

2. There are ruins of an old mill right off the street in The northwest corner of Easton. A different friend of mine swears he saw floating lights in the woods that contain the ruins. Years later the town put up a little historical sign about the site — apparently there were rumours at the time when it was operational that the owner was a “purported wizard” who used “satanic imps to run the mill at night”. 

3. I went to LSIS for 4th and 5th grades. It’s a beautiful, super old building right in the centre of town. Lots of nooks and crannies and “hidden” hallways and rooms to explore. I remember lots of kids saying they heard laughter or voices when we would sneak around during recess or whatever.

"Thank you for everyone’s responses so far.

This is for my spouse who has been dealing with this for years.  Now he has been trying to quit on and off for the past few months with no luck.  Maybe the best he has done was 2 months sober (maybe 3) but then went back bingeing.

Right now, he’s been sober for the past week but he is having an extremely hard time dealing with it.  

I did call a few rehab places today but when I approached him, he said he just wants to do an outpatient, even though this is a good time to go to an in house facility.  This place is able to have him work remotely at this facility (which I am not sure if it is a good idea if he still works during this time?).  Of course, I was upset when he rejected the idea.

What makes it more difficult is that the withdrawal symptoms are effecting not only me, but also the entire family environment. 

I know you can’t force any addict to do what is right and I know you can’t control anyone in this situation.

We would like to know if there is a market for this type of technology and if trainers are interested in seeing this technology become real. Many different aspects of our lives have been affected with augmented reality such as the use of the google lense.

There’s a butterfly sanctuary in Bourne (along the canal, not over the bridge) that is super neat to check out.

"Downtown Plymouth could be cool, depending on what they're looking for.

You could bike down the rail trail to Nelson Park ([https://www.seeplymouth.com/beaches-and-parks/nelson-memorial-park](https://www.seeplymouth.com/beaches-and-parks/nelson-memorial-park)), which has beach access, food trucks, ice cream, a splash pad, and a playground. From there you can walk into downtown Plymouth (about a half mile). For kids, there are several ice cream places, a full arcade, and some museum/history type stuff.

There's a pirate cruise that leaves right across from the arcade. They take you out and you apparently shoot water guns at guys dressed as pirates. Supposed to be great for kids under 10: [https://www.plymouthcruises.com/cruises/pirate-cruise/](https://www.plymouthcruises.com/cruises/pirate-cruise/)

If they want to see animals or get a little more history, you could go to Plymouth Plantation, which is about 2 miles from there. And on the way home, you can go to the Kingston Mall off exit 8 for several indoor kids things (there's a SkyZone for bounce jumping, a Billy Bees kids obstacle course, a toy store that rents motorized animals to drive around the mall on, a bowling alley and arcade, etc).

"My kids are just a little older than that. The South Shore is a blast every day in the summer. Off the top of my head, trying not to repeat already terrific recommendations:

Beaches, obviously, especially Nantasket Beach in Hull.

Take a harbor ferry from Hingham Shipyard ([MBTA](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/Boat-F1/line) or [Boston Harbor Cruises](http://www.bostonharborislands.org/ferry-schedule/) ), either just riding around, or get off at an island or few. Most just have hiking paths, but George's Island has amenities, [kids' activities most days (so do some other islands)](https://www.bostonharborislands.org/calendar/), and of course Fort Warren.

Miles Standish forest is fantastic for biking.

So, so many summer festivals and cool things. Check out the calendars at [Macaroni Kid South Shore](https://ssboston.macaronikid.com/), and [Mommy Poppins](https://mommypoppins.com/boston).

Animals and nature: [Natural Science Center](http://southshorenaturalsciencecenter.org/) in Norwell, [Mass Audobon Wildlife Sanctuary](https://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/wildlife-sanctuaries/daniel-webster) at the Daniel Webster estate (more just hiking there, but there's sometimes programming for guided hokes to spy critters).

To keep them active on a crappy day: jump around in bouncy castles on steroids at [Kidzone](https://norwellkidzone.com/) in Norwell (or Trampolines in Dedham, but that's not technically the South Shore).

Plimoth Plantation, duh. Kids don't have to get bogged down in history; it's fun to walk around the trails and village, and through the houses and gardens.

Choose from so many cool places on a [Free Fun Friday](http://highlandstreet.org/programs/free-fun-fridays-2019) (or do them another day when it's not free, but less crowded).

"Water Wizz in Wareham is great for that age! Not nate-y but definitely fun in the summer.

Also--do they fish? There are lots of great ponds and ocean piers to fish on in the South shore or upper cape. You would need a fishing license (you can get it online, and I believe it's pretty cheap) and I think kids don't need a license. 

A day at Nantasket and the boardwalk there is always fun too. And you can often find lots of ocean creatures at the beach or the bay!

And my last idea--one birthday I had as a kid, we rented kayaks and spent the day kayaking. We did it in Falmouth (upper cape) but I'm sure there are loads of places you can rent kayaks from on the south shore too!

I was trying to have a discussion about how to better the company I work for. But you don’t seem interested in doing that. I can tell you that Gap Inc. is taking a lot of steps to being a more sustainable company, but will that matter? You said you had a problem with companies lying to you. Well, everyone lies.

"Okay, good point. But, can I ask what you are doing to ensure the company is held responsible? That amends are made? 

If boycotting is your only response, the only people you are hurting are the low level employees who work in the stores. That profit doesn’t just go into the pockets of the top executives, it also goes into ensuring the continued employment of the many people employed in the stores. If enough people boycott the stores, stores in less profitable regions will close in order to protect the profit margins of the company as a whole. Who does that hurt? The store employees, possibly the district manager. 

Is there a way to effect change at the corporate mindset without endangering the jobs of those simply trying to support themselves? This is a genuine question.

I hope any customers who come into our store are able to sense the positive dynamic between the employees. I think that if we are having fun the customers’ experience will be better.
