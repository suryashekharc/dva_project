Seem to be a lot of haters here. I would start by going downtown Main Street. Last couple years Visalia Main Street has been popping. But I would also take a drive down on Mooney Boulevard. When you get established you can frequent the Tulare Outlets. Also Kaweah Lake and Three Rivers is great for fishing camping Etc. Visalia is a great place.

"This last year was the first time in over a decade we had traditional Tule Fog. The atmospheric conditions rarely exist any more due to either lack of moisture (hello drought) or wind (stirs the inversion layers). Climate change has ironically made things far less dangerous. That said, it is NOT just morning fog, and it is difficult to describe how the lack of visibility changes things. 

This is an insightful article from someone who moved to the Central Valley: [https://www.latimes.com/projects/return-tule-fog-california-central-valley/](https://www.latimes.com/projects/return-tule-fog-california-central-valley/)

I recall going to a family Christmas party in Strathmore back in the late '80's - just North of Porterville - an old orange growers ranch. When you don't visit a place in the country but maybe every other year, you might have to get out of the car and look at street signs in the dark and fog! My sister and I were both back from school, so we had a mutual support laugh about it, but there are no style points for being brave in dense fog.

SO - yes, the fog can be indescribably dense, no I don't like my wife commuting to Hanford in it, NO it is not common any longer and Visalia has a very good quality of life that I definitely prefer to Porterville. 

Incidental to all this, at the beginning of pandemic I had to turn up a different kind of VPN with more tolerance for latency due to the really crappy home cable internet connections for staff living in Porterville. They have some bough-five-times-since-Falcon connectivity there, seems to be Spectrum now. Blech. Frontier is the telco provider, double yuck! 

Comcast residential can be a nightmare to deal with, but the performance and cost in Visalia is darn good (Xfinity). The old Visalia neighborhoods with above-ground power/phone lines (you'll see the poles) are getting AT&T fiber at an astounding rate, 1 mile per day according to the AT&T tech I chatted with in our neighborhood. My cousin has their service a few blocks from us, symmetrical 1 Gbit is $80-ish a month (!!!). Unfortunately getting past the AT&T GPON terminal to run your own router and such is excessively difficult, so I run my own equipment on Xfinity.

of one crappy town and everyone knew which areas to attempt to avoid.  Over here on the other hand, you have a brief warning that you are on your way into a bad neighborhood by catching the decline in aesthetics of the nearby stores.  With all that said,  I wasted your time since I still have no answer to your question. It's really quite scary that a handful of streets in Visalia can produce so much crime and hurt.

Also, if nobody has told you yet, it gets tragically foggy here in the winter so if she works early sometimes you can barely see ten feet in front of your car and that's not an exaggeration.  It can be dangerous.

Visalia is better to live in hands down, no question, and it's not even close.  But that drive gets old quick.

"We were going to move from the house we were in to that same lennar new construction. I‚Äôm sure you saw in the disclosures about the homeless shelter and the low income housing. It‚Äôs going in right on the other side of the wall from those. The houses are pretty but we worried we wouldn‚Äôt be able to sell later for the amount we were buying the house for. We had signed and put our deposit down, then a few months later the shelter and apartment project was announced. We asked (and so did most other buyers) about making the neighborhood  gated but lennar said no.  

Another issue for us was that they kept delaying. The house we were supposed to buy was  supposed to be finished nov 12, then they said end of nov. Then Jan, then feb.  I drove by the other day and it‚Äôs not to done yet. 

We had sold our house and the buyers were letting us lease it back until the new construction was done, but they finally said no more extensions so we had to move out. There was nothing to rent short term. 
I know that‚Äôs not their fault but it was a problem for us. 


The car being lit on fire and the shooting at the park happened after we signed. Then they announced the shelter and apartments, and we were asked to sign new disclosures or if we wanted out they‚Äôd refund our deposit, so we started looking for another house. 

I would say don‚Äôt buy over there if u can avoid it, new construction or not. 
There‚Äôs San Joaquin homes on riggin and Akers, or southern highlands on visalia parkway and demaree if you want new construction. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, those houses are gorgeous- I was bummed at the location, and the park problems increasing. Riverway park is across a busy street from the houses. But the riverbed is along the outside of the housing tract and there‚Äôs a significant homeless problem here now. They‚Äôll be around those houses too So I would anticipate some problems. 

And visalia is nice enough. I just didn‚Äôt think it was a wise investment to buy over there.

"I have lived in Visalia full time since 2009 and have never been a victim of crime. It's a safe and convenient town to live in.

I think people like it here for the most part and the most thing you'll hear complaints about is that there isn't anything to do.

It‚Äôs super getto I only go to Huston to get Scotty donuts other than that never really walk there.

"There are actually a few precedents around the country for light rail lines considerably longer than the distance from Visalia to Hanford! Granted, most of them are within pretty continuously built-up areas, but I'd cite the River Line in New Jersey as an exception‚Äîits route from Trenton to Camden is over thirty miles, with several large gaps between stops.

Additionally, interurban-style service‚Äîoperating like light rail in city centers and like regional rail in more rural areas‚Äîused to be common across the US and died out largely due to the automobile lobby, as seen with the Pacific Electric in Los Angeles! This sort of service is still decently common in Europe to this day; I'd cite the Sheffield Supertram and the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn as good examples.

As for the case of Visalia and Hanford specifically, one big advantage of making that connection is because of the planned HSR station, which is much closer to Hanford than to Visalia. It makes total sense to connect the light rail system to the station, making the light rail an excellent solution for the last-mile problem. And if you're going all the way out to the station, might as well go to Hanford too; it's right there!

I'd say you're spot-on about the issues surrounding going east to the park, though.",t2_5zur73x2,thetransitgirl,0,1645063074.0,0,t1_hx96jzn,hx96jzn,False,sikhlakersfan,t3_lea4de,https://www.reddit.com/r/visalia/comments/lea4de/what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_visalia_light_rail/,What do you guys think of the Visalia light rail map I made,/r/visalia/comments/lea4de/what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_visalia_light_rail/hx96jzn/,2,r/visalia,0,2

"Thank you for the response! I submitted FOIAs to the Tulare County Sheriff's office, Mariposa Police Department, Tulare Police Department, Kingsburg Police Department, and the Visalia Police Department. Each department's response was that they had no files or evidence related to the homicide of Patrick Fyffe. Each department noted in their response that my request could most likely be completed by the Tulare County Sheriff's office. However it looks like at some point in the 50s or 60s these files were lost as well as all evidence involved.

You make a compelling argument.  I read every word of it.  I have lived in Tulare County for 40 or so years of my 45.  There was a horrible flood in 1955 or there about.  My grand mother told me there was 6 feet deep water on main street in Visalia.  The areas that Mr. Fyffe's car thief was spotted in are extremely rural  mountain communities.  The jacket found in Lodge Pole is not in police evidence?  It would have been Park Rangers at Lodge Pole and Dorst's Creek.  Lodge Pole is a trail head to the John Muir Trail of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  People rent pack mules in lodge pole and hike 30 miles up Mt. Whitney.  It is back country and that is where the trail went cold on the suspect.  Kingsburg is the closest city to Traver.  Kingsburg startles Fresno and Tulare county.  I don't think you mentioned Kingsburg.  Maybe try searching records there?  Great read very interesting.

Take a class or two at COS. You don‚Äôt have to do anything too curricular either. Maybe some classes like cooking or dancing.

If you skate or rollerblade, Provident skate park. Very upbeat and mostly chill crowd.

If all else fails, go on Facebook and the meetup app. They have groups you can get together with and do extracurricular activities like hiking, running, or even trivia nights sometimes.

"I would call the hotels in the area and see if they have a monthly rate.   This will avoid you signing any leases so you stay ""mobile"" so you may move out at anytime once you do find work.  I would estimate at a decent hotel it might be about $1300 to $1600 if they give you a monthly rate.  Do some searches on Priceline and Hotwire then call them directly and negotiate.  This is your best bet at staying at a decent hotel/motel for a reasonable price.  Going rates here are from $80 to $120 per night (per Hotwire and Priceline).

If you will not have a car, find something near groceries or be willing to pay a little more for Instacart/DoorDash/GrubHub to have things delivered to you.

Visalia has the best downtown in the valley. The sky will be clear soon so park on top of the parking structure on Acequia and look over the hills and downtown before walking to a restaurant on or just off Main. There's a lot of clothing and jewelry shops as well as a record shop on Main. Some have already suggested the Hotel restaurant but there's also good Mexican BBQ and Mediterranean downtown too. Then you could get hot chocolate at Starbucks and sit in the cold together looking at the lights.

"Actually thanks to the City of Fresno Nunes' district is a more blue-purple than you'd think. While all the city's except Fresno have turned more red Fresno grows the fastest and usually with Bay Area Refugees who haven't learned their lesson about bad politics yet. So a democrat does stand a chance at winning as long as at least 2 other towns vote blue with Fresno or at least an equal populations worth. 

It's actually a weird situation because many groups think Fresno should go with the more blue Stanislaus-Fresno district so it could have more representation without drowning Republican votes while some democrats would prefer the gamble of possibly taking Nunes' seat. 

There's also the racial question as removing Fresno from that district decreases the Latino population (and thus representation) but keeping it dilutes the African American population (representation) in the Tulare-Kings-Kern area due to CA redistricting rules.",t2_d4wx2un9,Sequoiadendron_1901,0,1638958306.0,0,t1_hnp9xgz,hnp9xgz,False,BlankVerse,t3_rb6wlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/visalia/comments/rb6wlq/devin_nunes_retirement_could_mean_an_opening_for/,Devin Nunes‚Äô retirement could mean an opening for California Democrats.

"If you are streaming several devices day in and day out independently, 1 TB for 5 people is nothing.  My household is 3 people and we on average about 700Gb monthly on Comcast.  I also work from home so that take up quiet a bit when you are remoting in to several instances everyday.

My suggestion is that it may be cheaper to just pay for an additional 500Gb. Prepaying it is cheaper than the overage cost.  I would also analyze why you are using so much.

"Ya see, you didn't listen at all.

Irrational psychopathic behaviour is what YOU feel is the answer to the question.  Before even considering the situation logically and with empathy your IMMEDIATE reaction is to dismiss the behavior.

Ill give an example using Trump supporters on Jan 6.  I don't think insurrectionists were (all) sociopaths, irrational sure, but I recognize (through empathy) that they feel helpless and angry, that their voices arent heard and they had no other choice but violence because they believe a big lie.  That they trust their friends and peers over objective, measurable evidence, which is why they believe the big lie.  It does not mean I support their decision, but understanding motive goes a long way when determining whether you support something or not.  Meanwhile, we are literally watching republicans dismantle democracy, gerrymander and suppress votes in a tangible, factual, well documented and easily proven way and its resulting in the despair of the other side who will feel powerless as Republicans easily win 2022, 2024 and beyond.
