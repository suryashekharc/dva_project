"Student board, student run. All undergrads. ED  handles administrative stuff. They have no voting rights. Pays $39k now I believe? Plus benefits. School holidays off plus two weeks vacation. Summer is obscenely flexible. 

It's a decent wage for Lethbridge, especially considering the flexibility. Plus it allows for side/contract work. Plus the ED has the ability to run side projects with board approval (conversion therapy ban, COVID helping hands group, anti fracking campaign). This food box program is exciting. These projects connect the community to the campus and create opportunities for grads to extend their work.",t2_3x19214y,piratesmashy,0,1648279413.0,0,t1_i2628yt,i2628yt,False,Afraid-Ice-2062,t3_tof0xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tof0xk/new_ed_at_lpirg/,New ED at LPIRG,/r/Lethbridge/comments/tof0xk/new_ed_at_lpirg/i2628yt/,1,r/Lethbridge,0,1

"There's been seven EDs I believe. Three were hired after they finished school. Three were community members. And now a grad student. Two of the community members were UofL grads. 

While the outgoing ED has a voice in the hiring, the board makes its selection based on their goals. I'm very excited to see what the new ED does. I'm hoping it includes adding grad students to LPIRG. There's funding available to levy paying students and this could be a boon to grad research.

"Various whistleblowers have leaked this info out several times. For example:

*""Michael Bates represents both Phillips and a woman who accused a retired LPS inspector of sexual assault. Both of his clients received anonymous whistleblower letters in June regarding discussions within the service.*

*""In one of the disclosures, there is a suggestion of a potential plan of retaliation against a named member of the professional media as well as a sitting member of the legislative assembly of Alberta for what can be inferred as \[them\] having sought public accountability of the Lethbridge police service,"" Bates said at a Lethbridge Police Commission meeting on Wednesday night.""*

Another later story:

*""Three officers also recently pled guilty to misconduct and two others planned to retire for their roles in circulating inappropriate* ***memes***""

Highlight is mine. There have been multiple leaks that the ""memes"" included Shannon Phillips and journalist Megan Grant, with violent and sexual imagery. It's all vague reporting because the police are extremely opaque in this and reporting on it (as Megan Grant did) opens you to retaliation, harassment, and surveillance - like when they posted their surveillance photos of Shannon to right wing Facebook groups

**17** women recently came forward to allege sexual harassment, bullying, assault, and blackmail in the department, so it isn't like this doesn't have legs. We'll never know because the investigations are all kept tightly under wraps, but somehow every time info leaks out it's the scariest possible shit. We're a pretty small department so when you see almost 20 women come forward with this stuff, and you see that they had **6** civilian staff on stress leave **at one time** from the harassment...

*""Jane found herself being harassed, too. Once, she had a sergeant ponder aloud to her whether he could get suspended with pay should he grab her breasts.*

*There was also the time another officer commented on her underwear. Or when an officer told her he always wanted to ""go there.""""*

&#x200B;

Another woman staffer:

*""Her biggest issue at LPS was a staff sergeant who she alleges, over the years, accused her of having a mental illness and blackmailed her with a failing performance review he had written...*

*On several occasions, Alice says she refused to share personal information after he'd dug into her Facebook page. That's when he accused her of having a mental illness.""*

This department is a garbage fire wrapped in shit and with the constant avalanche of allegations if even a fraction of it is true it would be enough to get any ordinary citizen indicted.

It's interesting to me that you looked at the one article, didn't immediately find anything on the one thing I said and brushed over the surveillance of Shannon, including 8 different unauthorized database searches and surreptitious photos taken of her and other community members she interacted with **that were posted online to Facebook groups to target her**.

"No, they formed communities and worked together. That old “all against all” line was a thought experiment by Roseau about what could explain the modern proclivity towards violence to enforce political goals.

"When it comes to the drivers test  here is the 3 tips I give.

 A) where there is  almost always 2 answers that are completely incorrect. So then you can choose between 2.

To turn right from a two-way road onto another two-way road, what should you do?

a swing wide to the left before turning

b Stay in your turning lane

c Turn into the left lane

d Do all of the above.

So C is wrong as you're turning right, because of that D is wrong.

Left with A and B, so think would you swing the car wide to turn right? No so then you would just choose C

&#x200B;

B) All are right so choose the most correct, this is where it may get tricky as the answers can be similar. For example 

You must signal when you are  
a pulling out from a curb

b changing lanes

c turning

d all of the above

&#x200B;

C) act out the question  when it comes to a physical action ( think back to A and action they are asking.

"Hahaha in the london road area I had my truck broken into and all my work tools stolen, and then a year later my truck was stolen which had all my now 1 year old replacement tools. Then  a year after that had someone come in through our back door. They very politely left when they saw us though.

In Sunridge a coworker has had people break into his truck so many times they wrecked the lock on the passenger side. Each time they couldn't get the lock to open so just smashed the passenger window but over repeated attempts with a flat blade it screwed it. He recently had someone drill out his sheds door lock. They managed to steal... about $20 in soil testing chemicals. 

Near the hospital my buddy has had his truck broken into a few times but the last time they decided to try to steal the truck itself by hotwiring it. All they managed to do was destroy the lock/ignition and wiring. Requiring a $1k fix.

My other buddy lived in Hardyville for a decade, dirtbike say outside the entire time no problems. Later loved to London road, also left it unchained in his backyard for 3 years. No problems.

In West highlands my brother had his Volkswagen remote lock hacked by gang members down from Calgary. Apparently a regular occurrence according to the cops. When taking the car up though they hit the ditch near Diamond City going 150km/hr. They torched the car to hide the evidence. It made the news at the time.

"I'll never understand the shortsightedness of people.  

Investments in addictions and mental health pay off in many ways...but because that money isn't going to corporate handouts or text cuts for the rich, it's going to the wrong people.  

Something as simple as easy access to primary healthcare saves tens of thousands a year.  Catch an infection early enough that it's a 7 day course of antibiotics (that costs under $20) instead of requiring an ER visit ($400 at minimum), surgical debridement ($2500+) and inpatient treatment ($5000+).  All in all a visit from me, with meds, usually runs the province about $100.  Infection leading to amputation of a minor digit, $22,500 (or more, depending on physical therapy and rehab time).

"I am biased towards places that have people that are consistently happier and healthier. Japan has a ton of excellent examples, in fact in my experience their public transit is better even than Europe's. Europe is just more culturally similar to us, so they make a better starting point for discussion.

EVs are better than ICE vehicles, no argument there, but they do little for the safety aspect, and they have the added negative of being heavier, so our already unsustainable car infrastructure wears out faster. Batteries are also a significant cost that can be largely avoided using light rail or overhead lines on transit. I think EVs have a place, but just replacing cars with slightly better cars is a half measure at best.

"Well there is a program announced last week that would allow a person to stay as a refuge for 3 years and not have to apply for PR or citizenship.

1) identify if there is a willingness to host

2a) identify individuals that would be willing to come

"So we had workplace order issues when Dylan’s first opened (plus when they first opened they had this weird rice thing instead of regular fries and people were confused by the lack of fries). I personally wouldn’t care if my burger wasn’t exactly the way I wanted it as long as it wasn’t burnt but many work people complained about the sides and the unsolicited medium rare burgers so we didn’t order from them after the first two failures. 

At a new job now and we tried Dylan’s once and same issue with the medium rare. I mean they need to check the temperature and cook of their food. People who want a well done burger will simply never eat a medium rare burger. 

I find it is often hard to order workplace food from the non chains because these kinds of issues.

"TL;DR: As an American I know there are 'rules' in regards to the flying and conduct of the US flag- but none of these patriot zealots in the US give two shits about it until it suits them. 

Hello Gentleperson (yes I'm one of those 'hippies' lol). American here who has moved to Canada. To the best of my knowledge as I've been told America has a code of conduct regarding the flag! It states that by right you are to fly the flag of the US above any other flag as long as you are on US soil, \*however\* the code also says some other interesting things.

It's not to be printed on anything disposable, it is to be not to be printed on or used as clothing, it is not to be left in the rain, nor is it allowed to become tattered or discolors. Should it touch the ground it is to be respectfully burnt. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/8#:\~:text=The%20flag%20should%20never%20be%20carried%20flat%20or%20horizontally%2C%20but,always%20allowed%20to%20fall%20free.

I bring this all up because a lot of this sort of stuff are done by people who are those I refer to as 'hyper patriots', whom- as someone else suggested, are suffering from some related mental illness. Possibly, and normally, delusion and/or paranoia brought on by some traumatic event in their life. Often times it's the first and it's been indoctrinated into them since birth and as such see themselves and their actions as perfectly rational. However those of us who are open and aware of other going-on's in the world know that it is far from what they think it is.

Right now the US has people \*praising\* Putin and Russian and says the US should be more like Russia (that's a discussion for another day and when I've had more coffee, maybe some vodka) are the same people that tell those like me who want to see genuine change for their home country (and even here where I'm just a PR) for the betterment of the average person to move to Canada, Norway, where ever, there if we 'don't like it here' (one of many inconsistencies and glaring cognitive dissidents with them).",t2_b45t5,Werepup,0,1647694242.0,0,t1_i19wqls,i19wqls,False,Upper-Anxiety-4274,t3_th76ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/th76ht/does_this_make_anyone_else_extremely_frustrated/,Does this make anyone else extremely frustrated?

"Ah ok, I apologize for wording that wrong. But let's not downplay the effect this has on people. We're not talking about having to give up a vacation to Mexico. My husband works at a company that requires proof of vaccination. They haven't dropped the requirement now that the government is relaxing the rules. Workers rights are legally protected as they relate to things like gender, nationality etc. But now employers are allowed to require employees to disclose personal health information. And I can understand if it's truly necessary for the job (ex: healthcare worker) but this is just a food processing plant. 

Don't get me wrong; we happily got the jab as we felt it was the best choice. But looking for a new job would have been rough, financially. For us, it wasn't really a choice, even though it wasn't legally required. 

I think people are worried about their rights not being protected. If employers can choose to hire/fire based on vaccine status, how about another medical condition?

"I’m recovering from disordered eating patterns from middle/high school, compounded by 60lbs of weight gain in 6 months from medication. After my gain, the docs adjusted my meds and my weight was constant for a few months, I tried the FBBC 6-week challenge.
I really liked the 25 minute workouts and coach accountability. I liked that the workouts had a recorded option so I could do them on my own time.

What I didn’t like was the fatphobic, diet culture that I felt they adhered to. Tracking food was mandatory, which can cause obsession in people with previous disorder eating patterns. Can force restriction, which often causes binges. Additionally, at the end of the program, I talked about my long term weight goals, and they told me that my fat percent goal should actually be almost 5% lower than I wanted and would not compromise on what they considered the “ideal fat amount” for MY body.

I did lose weight on their program, but I gained it all back and more after because my body was so messed up from the restriction they pretend is nutrition. Based on the recent scientific research, no restriction diets can offer sustainable wellness results for both physical and mental well-being, so current best recommendations are to increase physical activity and to make small, sustainable diet changes over time (adding more veggies, drinking more water, swapping whole wheat/grain for white/bleached wheat, lower sugar options, leaner meats, etc.).

Ultimately, I cannot recommend a gym that refuses to work with a clients goals and imposes their own goals instead, especially when they require all clients, regardless of goals or past history with disorder eating, to adhere to a strict calorie-based regime. Some people want to pursue health in a way that doesn’t fuel into diet-culture and disordered eating, and if you’re one of these people who want healthy relationships with food and nutrition, then this gym is not likely to be a good fit for you.",t2_4q0dpfbh,sammark99,0,1647666332.0,0,t1_i18y5hj,i18y5hj,True,[deleted],t3_tf7850,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tf7850/fit_body_boot_camp/,Fit Body Boot Camp,/r/Lethbridge/comments/tf7850/fit_body_boot_camp/i18y5hj/,2,r/Lethbridge,0,2

"I think it’s worth clarifying that people can be privileged in one or many areas, which impacts their opportunities and treatment by society. A downtrodden, able-bodied, white male has more privilege than a downtrodden, disabled, black female because the white male would face barriers from living in poverty, but not racism, sexism, or ableism. A poor white male could still get hired at many places that would reject a poor black female with equal credentials and abilities.
Privilege in one area just means they aren’t discriminated against in the *one* way, but can face struggles in others. And being privileged doesn’t mean one has had it easy either, just that they have faced hardships that would have likely been harder if they had belonged to a marginalized group or had more intersectional marginalized identities.",t2_4q0dpfbh,sammark99,0,1647663668.0,0,t1_i18twvy,i18twvy,False,Upper-Anxiety-4274,t3_th76ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/th76ht/does_this_make_anyone_else_extremely_frustrated/,Does this make anyone else extremely frustrated?

"As far as the big banks go, they are almost all the same so if you find a branch that has friendly service, go there. 

I banked with RBC for almost a decade, and I moved out here in September and had horrible in-branch experiences so I moved my accounts to BMO. 

If you ask 20 different people which bank is the best and worst, you’ll have horror stories from each of the main banks and praise for each of them as well. I chose BMO because I like the way the accounts are set up (and they have specialized indigenous banking offers). 

I’d recommend a credit union if you plan on living in Alberta for a long time. The only reason I didn’t move to a credit union was because I move quite often so I like to be with a bank that I know will be in every city I go to.

They have a very large selection of whiskeys, great staff who are actually knowledgeable and enjoy it. Usually i tell them a tasting note or experience im looking for and they can nail it down for me but i have been there several times so the one staff member who is a bit of a younger guy but super knowledgeable knows what im looking for. 

Last time i was there, it was still under construction but they have an isle or area of an isle dedicated to bourbon(and white whiskey), scotch (by region), japanese, canadian and irish. 

Wine cavern is nice but they have a small selection of nothing special, Andrew Hilton is even smaller and pricier and with prices as they are, best place i find is still Wine and Beyond.

"I've greatly appreciated my relationship with 1st Choice Savings and Credit Union. They really provide personal service. If you need cheques printed it's done immediately on site. Exchanging for foreign currency is easy.

The app was recently revamped. It's functional, allows for biometric sign in, and I've had no issues with it. There's a secondary app that has discounts and what not at businesses for members. 

When we opened an account for the kid she took a lot of time to discuss banking, savings, etc with him. I appreciated that.

Trudeau has won 3 out of 3 consecutive elections. Canada chose him, and not just once as a fluke. And they hate that. 

Being compassionate and prioritizing the well-being of their community over their own convenience feels like a very Canadian thing to me. And they hate that too. 

So why are they using this flag to represent their cause when it more literally represents a country that is in direct conflict with their self-centred and deliberately ignorant worldview? 

Also, a lot of the people on FB that I saw making Pro-Convoy posts are the same people Ive seen expressing support for separating from Canada. So... they hate this country so much they want to leave it and take the whole province with them...but they still want to wave around our flag?

"This is just it.

Plus, many people have courses that are only offered in the Spring semester. So imagine not being able to graduate on time, and start a potential job that is lined up, through no fault of your own. THEN, waiting an entire \*year\* to finish where you left off?

They're really digging themselves a hole. I'm frankly shocked that a resolution hasn't been reached yet. I estimated that if it wasn't resolved last week - they'd be better off offering crucial courses (needed to graduate, start practicum like yourself) in the summer - and just give everyone credit or refund for this semester. The reason is, there's no way to pack in the relevant coursework on time now. You're going to be losing some of the value of the course you paid full price for - and have a hellish April. That's the best case scenario, and that seems really inadequate to me.

I say call the semester, arrange for the crucial classes to be completed in the summer, resolve this strike issue, and call it a day. The delivery of some courses over the summer may fuck with some people, and I do understand that. People have summer worked lined up, they have leases running out in May. But at least it offers the fairest solution, IMO.

Cramming courses past April \*really\* fucks with people because then it is messing with leases, summer job line ups for the entire student body, and it will make everyone miserable.

Just my two cents anyways. I really feel for you guys right now. I haven't been involved at the U for many years now, but I'm sure glad I graduated when I did.

"I typed it all out and then had to delete it! That's OK though, it's good for civility.

I was going to say that people are abstract creatures. We place a lot of value on forms of expression. So I understand that. But to take the interpretation of a symbol to the point of being offended by it, or worse yet - wanting it banned in some cases - that's delving in to the realm of zealous actions based on perceived moral purity.

For example - most people object the Nazi flag. For very understandable reasons. But the author of Bill C-313 thinks it is \*literally\* threatening. To me, that is no different than zealous religious leaders during the crusades banning heathen religious symbols out of a view that they are literally offending God.

At the end of the day, these are just scribbles. They're literally nothing - they're pieces of cloth with stuff imprinted on them. That's it. Every other aspect about them is subjective. Since every person may interpret something differently - what is the point of being offended over it? If we simply yield to the offense that overly sensitive people put on displays of things, what does that make us? Where exactly do we draw that line?

"I guess I would just say that the crossing of a road is not the same as using the multi-use path, even if they are contiguous. The fine for drivers related to crosswalks is ""failure to yield to a pedestrian."" You are only a pedestrian if you are walking. Possibly you are not legally reponsible to walk across, but when drivers are not legally required to yield, I would suggest yielding yourself. Especially when you are soft, squishy, and slow, and they are hard, heavy, and fast.

"So, usual caveat that I'm not a lawyer or a bylaw expert or whatever, but I'm 90% sure that isn't true. Bikes are treated as vehicles in some ways, but in the case of Mayor Magrath bikes are explicitly forbidden from using the road, because Mayor Magrath doesn't have a sidewalk, it has a parallel ""multi-use pathway"". So we aren't allowed to act as vehicles.

I think the confusion comes from bikes not being allowed on normal sidewalks (that's the law in Calgary and Edmonton, and I think Lethbridge as well, although I'm not 100% sure), so generally a bike shouldn't use a crosswalk because they shouldn't have been on the sidewalk in the first place.

"WOW.

I completely agree that what the city did was not the best decision. I also am fully committed to education of everyone in the province.

Maybe instead of coming across as an asshole when someone asks a question regarding your post, you should think about the wording used in your title. You posted a link regarding school bussing services being dropped by the city and said it hasn't aged well. Let's be frank, it was already a nasty vomitous pile of filth before it even came out the door - so aging it really doesn't change much about it. Our city has been hot garbage getting hotter for a long time now.

My question was - what specific event or incident that has made you repost a link from 3 years ago? And, for those who aren't directly impacted/unaware of the situation, what made you bring it up? I don't think that the vitriol with which you replied was warranted.

"Yeah you've got some good points. Historical beliefs can overrun the moral foundations of the religion. The Bible doesn't say the earth is only 6000 years old, and the Book of Mormon doesn't say the Lamanites were the only people surviving in the Americas before colonization. Some people still focus on those interpretations while setting aside the clear and repeated messages to love your neighbour, give to the poor, judge not, be humble, repent, and follow Christ. Those virtues are challenging, and in our weakness we substitute traditional compliance for true religious devotion. It's not justified at all. 

When I was young I read in the Book of Mormon words that I had heard members of my family say, and had to wrestle with the conclusion that they had been wrong.

>Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just—  
But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God. ([Mosiah 4:17-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.17?lang=eng&clang=eng#p17))

I would avoid anything close to the downtown core for both the south and north side. Best way to put it is to draw a big square from Mayor Magrath to both 9th Ave n and 9 Ave s then from there to scenic drive. Having lived in London road it's definitely not the greatest then again I was also really close to downtown. I would say Legacy Ridge is probably your best bet. It's a newer area but is close to the Alexander Wilderness park which would feature those nice trees. There is also a school out there. It's also decently close to the new park that was recently built out in Blackwood. The Westside is also relatively nice but also still fairly new and definitely still developing.,t2_in9urc1n,gofyourself99,0,1647452426.0,0,t1_i0ws2xv,i0ws2xv,True,lookhowfunnymynameis,t3_tex644,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tex644/neighbourhoods/,Neighbourhoods?,/r/Lethbridge/comments/tex644/neighbourhoods/i0ws2xv/,2,r/Lethbridge,0,2

"I'm new to Alberta but I've gotten the impression there's a problem with racial prejudice and lack of social support programs, and that some of that is among the church members. This disappoints me greatly as a fellow member, having always been taught to ""Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you."" [(Jacob 2:17)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng) If we are true followers of Christ, there will be no persecution or inequality. Honestly, I have done too little to help those in need and can't righteously point a finger at others. The Book of Mormon actually states that all children of God are equal.

>For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile. [2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng&clang=eng#p33)

If conservatives actually represent the christian values of charity, honesty, and purity,  they can be a great strength to society instead of creating more conflict.

I'm confused about your last sentence though; the descendants of Lehi in the Book of Mormon are part of the scattered 12 tribes of Israel because Lehi descended from Joseph ([1 Nephi 5:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5?lang=eng&id=14#p14); [Alma 10:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&id=3#p3)). No one rejected Christ in the account of His visit to the Americas ([3 Nephi 10:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10?lang=eng); [11:15-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng); [4 Nephi 1:1-2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1?lang=eng)). As for ""why their skin is not white"", I'll leave the reader to interpret [2 Nephi 5:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.21?lang=eng&clang=eng#p21).

"May can be hit or miss but typically a track suit or sweatsuit will be plenty. Worth having shorts & t-shirts. Mid teens to low twenties. Occassional light snow. We don't plant gardens until the third week of May to avoid frost by the days are fine. 

June-Aug temps range from 22-35° typically. It's a dry heat which is nice. Because it's prairies not ocean it stays warm quite late into the evening. But that also means if it's hot it ain't cooling down. 

September is a crap shoot not unlike May but sometimes (2019 specifically, I'm still bitter) there'll be a 12""+ dump of snow.

My understanding is that normal practice would be that a lawyer would be appointed for the child and I think it is very telling that the journalist has no mention of what that lawyer has said or has been saying. 

While it is certainly not true that kids should have final say, what this kid has to say is important. It’s hard to imagine this article as being anything other that completely devastating for the child who is definitely old enough to read it.

It’s also interesting that the mom hasn’t appealed anything. She keeps going back to the same judge she claims is biased against her with new applications. Why is she doing that? She’s had three lawyers. Why doesn’t someone just appeal?

"Lethbridge has pretty terrible urban planning - new subdivisions lack trees, and are far from most services, so you're right that you'll need the older parts of town. I'd recommend looking at the Fleetwood or Victoria Park subdivisions on the south side - they avoid some of the property crime you'll get in London Road due to proximity to downtown, and are close to Fleetwood Bawden School. The trees are beautiful too - they have the ""kissing canopy"" effect on a lot of the roads.

The north side is generally considered less safe, but I'm not sure if there's anything to back that up. Westminster and the Winston Churchill area are both fairly nice and will be cheaper than the south side.

Getting into newer (but still old) subdivisions, you could look at Lakeview and Redwood. They're a bit pricier and a bit more suburban, but not bad. Personally I'd avoid the west side entirely unless you work there, I've lived on both and not needing to commute across the coulees every day is a game changer. If you do have your heart set on the west side, Varsity Village is nice (although crime is more of a problem than most people think) and Indian Battle Heights is also pretty nice, it has a good park system but loses the easy access to Nicholas Sheran Lake.",t2_eakj6c2b,Vast-Salamander-123,0,1647371953.0,0,t1_i0sckh8,i0sckh8,True,lookhowfunnymynameis,t3_tex644,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tex644/neighbourhoods/,Neighbourhoods?,/r/Lethbridge/comments/tex644/neighbourhoods/i0sckh8/,10,r/Lethbridge,0,10

"Mature trees and landscaping you’ll probably be looking at the older parts of town like London Road or near Henderson Lake like Lakeview. I’m fairly partial to the west side as I’ve lived here for the whole time I’ve been here, and the older parts would be Varsity or Indian Battle Heights but the west side as a whole is much newer than the majority of the east (or, north or south sides as there isn’t technically an east)

"Can you fix your first link? It doesn't work and doesn't open the paper.

In terms of your second link about super immunity, the data and stats may indeed show that vaccination and infection show more robust immune responses than either alone, but that doesn't take into account that, vaccinated or not, many people are still dying from the disease and don't have the luxury of risking infection. 

It is unlikely that this virus will ever disappear completely. However, I'm sure many people a few hundred years ago said the same thing about the Black Plague. Plague killed 100s of millions of people and destroyed entire cities and areas. Some people in [Eyam, a town in Derbyshire](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/03/02/bubonic-plague-coronavirus-quarantine-eyam-england/) probably objected to the 14 month total lockdown that was put in place to protect the villages and cities to the north, but it worked. Bigger centres like Manchester and Sheffield were spared the brunt of the outbreak.

In fact, [outbreaks still occur](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/seriously-dont-worry-about-the-plague) with health advisories and travel restrictions, even though only a few cases are detected every year (~7 in the US!). Thankfully, we have treatment for it (antibiotics), so it's not really a huge deal (although, to the people who catch it, it certainly is). 

What's my point?

New Zealand is like a reverse Eyam. They're locking down to *prevent* the disease getting there, and if they deal with it harshly enough and keep it isolated whenever it does show up, eventually in the rest of the world the virus will fade far enough into the background that they won't need to care about having super immunity because either a) there will be few enough cases per year globally that it won't spread there, b) there will be effective anti-viral treatments to prevent severe disease in anyone who does get it, or c) both. 

And guess what? If that scenario does come to pass, which I think it will if NZ keeps it up and holds their resolve, then it will save countless lives in their country that people like you would sacrifice just so other people can have their ""freedoms"".",t2_19m4z6od,TheWhompingPillow,0,1647269897.0,0,t1_i0mgevz,i0mgevz,False,DonaldRudolpho,t3_tdmd0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tdmd0m/loss_of_third_nichols_to_positive_covid19_test/,Loss of third Nichols to positive COVID-19 test ‘gut punch’ for Gushue rink,/r/Lethbridge/comments/tdmd0m/loss_of_third_nichols_to_positive_covid19_test/i0mgevz/,1,r/Lethbridge,0,1

"I did say that Aus and NZ were going to be hardest hit by COVID because they were under COVID-zero policies - China will be as well. [Studies in the last 6 months have shown](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00676-9/fulltext) that natural immunity is capable of reducing the risk of reinfection, if you have had the virus previously AND taken the vaccine, [that is being dubbed ""super immunity](https://news.ohsu.edu/2022/01/25/new-study-suggests-two-paths-toward-super-immunity-to-covid-19)"" so if you are NOT in the risk group for COVID, getting COVID is better in the long run in regards to protecting you against reinfection from other variants.

Because Aus and NZ were under COVID-zero policies, nobody there had a chance to get immunity through natural means, this leads to high case rates once the policy is abolished...higher rates than what countries not employing the policy had.

What we are seeing right now in NZ where 20,000 people per day on average are getting the virus and just over 200,000 of their citizens being listed as active in just under 3 weeks alone.

"Same reasoning as to the idea that because I am a white person it is my fault indigenous people are struggling.  

It doesn’t make sense.  

You are not responsible for anyone but yourself.  Unfortunately, stereotypes exist.

To clarify: I am not blaming.  I said no one is responsible for other peoples actions.  The first statement was an example of the stupidity of stereotypes.  We all have a responsibility to treat each other with respect and dignity, but you can’t blame Joe down the street for Cindy’s choices.",t2_2gvdjip8,tmwatz,0,1647211545.0,0,t1_i0jqoln,i0jqoln,True,[deleted],t3_tctpgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/tctpgi/where_does_this_idea_that_as_a_blood_tribe_member/,Where does this idea that as a Blood Tribe member I'm somehow responsible for the actions of the addicts here in town?,/r/Lethbridge/comments/tctpgi/where_does_this_idea_that_as_a_blood_tribe_member/i0jqoln/,0,r/Lethbridge,0,0

"They say that it's your responsibility because Aboriginal People's are still not seen as equals. They're always ""someone else's problem"" and viewed as lesser than. The city will not take responsibility for their homeless, addicted, and criminals no matter what though, but try to put the responsibility on everyone else. It's the politics game, always someone else's problem, never their own, so they never have to do anything.
