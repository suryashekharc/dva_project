"I've been to a really mediocre local restaurant that has rave reviews.

People in reviews were calling it a life altering experience and best meal of their life.

and it was mediocre and overpriced.

Most favorable comment from our group was, ""It's a hotel restaurant, what do you expect?""

People have different tastes but it's also an Emperor's New Clothes kind of thing because if you are making reservations and getting dressed up for a special night out you want it to be great and if it's not you maybe fake it.

I haven't been to Mateo's, but I expect it's mostly that.

Personally, I might give them a pass on the food but not on the service.

I leave accurate reviews for restaurants various places and I'm always amused by the responses from other people including:

""I'm friends with the owner. I've never had a bad meal there.""

"Yeah I agree. Had a ER doc in our house last weekend for the first kids party post lockdown.  She's seen Covid at its worst - killing otherwise healthy young people.

We were all part of a cohort that caught covid early in the school year from the kids - it swept through their grade like wildfire.  Interestingly it did not really spread throughout the grades through siblings.  It seems to just peter out after a while based on this one incident.

"Do:

* Find good, local barbecue.
* Eat some breakfast biscuits.
* Get to the farmers' market early.
* Check out the amazing baseball here. We have the Durham Bulls, and the ACC is generally top of the bunch nationally for baseball.
* Enjoy the local hiking and greenways. Duke Forest, the Eno, and American Tobacco Trail all spring to mind. None of them are going by points of national renown, but they're all lovely ways to get outside.
* Wave and say hello to people you meet.
* Take in the next couple of months of absolute beauty of trees and flowers.
* Get some local coffee. Counter Culture is nationally renowned and widely available here. We also have a ton of great coffee shops.
* Enjoy the restaurants downtown. There are a ton of great options. Others have covered them.
* Try the taco trucks located everywhere. Folks who aren't from here don't necessarily associate Durham with latino immigrants, but we have a vibrant community.
* Check out the rest of North Carolina. I guarantee our state park staffs are friendlier than any you met up north, which makes going to those places a real joy. We have amazing, wide, clean, quiet beaches, and the mountains are, in my opinion, the height of Appalachian beauty. 

Don't:

* Call cooking hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, steak, etc. on a grill ""barbecuing."" Call cooking those things grilling out or similar. People care because barbecue is an important cultural touchstone here, and using the word for other things dilutes that cultural heritage.
* Be outside after about 11:30 p.m. on July 4th or New Year's if you can help it.
* Tailgate.

"No, I have an issue with dogs because  it’s happened often enough that it’s what I expect will likely happen when I go somewhere and there is a dog around. 

You may want to review probability rules. There is not really a 100 percent chance of many things happening. If a drunk does want to talk to me, I have no problem telling them to fuck off. If someone’s dog runs up to me and puts its nose on me and I have to react, they act like I’m unreasonable for not wanting a dog to touch me.  I’m not sure if you know this, but in fact not everyone goes to a bar to interact! Some of us go to a bar (even a “busy” bar) to drink and mind our business. 

I dont give a shit what the dogs intentions are. Just like I wouldn’t touch someone’s dog without asking, owners should not let their dogs do it to people without their permission. 

You really dont seem to understand introverts much, and you seem to think that presence in a public place creates an obligation to strangers. If I’m at a bar the only person I need to interact with, unless I CHOOSE otherwise, is the person serving drinks.  But you basically seem to say single people should just stay in their cave at home if they dont want to be free game to have to talk to everyone - “the public” isn’t the right place? Jesus Christ. Stay out of the public if you dont agree that people can bother you and dogs can put their nose in your crotch because it’s just being friendly.

Pure intentions does not create an obligation on my part. I thought by 2022 we had realized about bodily autonomy but you sound like a typical member of the smile police.  If people would recognize not everyone loves Foofy Woofy and would keep their dog from touching people without their consent, I wouldn’t fee the way I do about places allowing dogs in, but instead they just act like their dogs “pure intentions” mean I have to allow a slobbery beast to run up on me or I’m an asshole, just like you’re doing now.

You have a right to be left alone pretty much anywhere you go, short of an event whose actual purpose is to mix and mingle with others, like a networking mixer or a speed dating event.

"> Cable companies keep promising DOCSIS 4.0 will bring 10Gbit symmetrical service and all sorts of other hopium/pie-in-the-sky shit, but it probably won't happen any time soon.

I think one of the biggest disadvantages cable companies have is that they have to re-use current stuff to move forward. The companies with fiber have a lot more leeway.

If AT&T/Frontier/Google want to upgrade service, they have the whole frequency of the fiber available. They can run XGS-PON on a different frequency than their old GPON service and not require any upgrades in customer's premises. Any customer signing up now or upgrading their service gets a new install with the newer equipment that supports XGS-PON.

Spectrum has a bigger uphill battle. They are doing upgrades to high and mid split situations, which would allow more upload channels, but they have to get people off old cable boxes and old cable modems before that can all ~~happen~~ finish.

"Short answer: AT&T.

Long answer: There's a few factors.

1. Is your place a new build that has Spectrum's fiber service? If so, AT&T may be cheaper, but Spectrum fiber is very, very reliable. They have the same plans as coax for their lower tier plans, but their gigabit plan (IF YOU ARE ON FIBER, NOT COAX) is 1000/500. But it costs more than AT&T, for sure.
2. Do you like to have control over your equipment? If you love managing your own router and firewall, you won't like AT&T -- they require you to use their router/firewall, which has a passthrough, but will still hit NAT tables on the device (It's pretty much a DMZ).
3. How much do you care about price/performance? In a lot of areas with AT&T Fiber/Google Fiber/Frontier Fiber, Spectrum will offer their Ultra plan (400/20 -- but with overprovisioning is like 480/24) for $30/mo. Unless you need upload, it's hard to pass over that deal for some of AT&T's deals. I think AT&T is $50/mo for 500/500 and $80 for 1000/1000.

Over the last few years, I've had Google Fiber for a year, Spectrum Fiber for a year, and Spectrum coax for like 6 years. All have been reliable in my case, but maybe I've just been lucky.

EDIT: Spectrum's home Fiber service ain't too bad. These are two speed tests I just ran back-to-back:

It could be that the vaccination rate of students is lower than the threshold that DPS wants before ""safely"" dropping the mandate. Having a bunch of kids out is disruptive and costly. It could also be that

"You do not have an issue with dogs. You have an issue with rude/ignorant owners who don’t try to train/control their dog which this post is not about. If you take your dog out in public it’s  assumed it stays by you the entire time. 

There seems to be a loss in translation here. I’m talking about a bars. Not a “quiet” sit down place like mcabes. If you expect to go to any bar and not interact with others, that’s your problem, not theirs. If a dog is too touchy it’s because the owner is allowing it. I agree no one should be “touching” you, but if you’re trying to avoid interaction, maybe the public isn’t the right place for that? I understand that you are presenting your view, but just as the other commenter did, you’ve added nothing to my comment but describe personal experiences that you dislike. This whole thread is about where dogs can go, not a expose of “the reasons dogs make us uncomfortable”

Just another view on it, when you go to a bar there is a 100% chance another inebriated patron will talk to you. Not exactly with the best of intensions. When a dog comes up to you, it just looking for attention, there’s no sub text, they just want to say hello and move on not have you buy them their 5th shot. Dogs intensions are pure, how they are received by a person is up to that person.

Don't - walk or jog alone on a street you are not familiar with.

Do - go to the Saltbox for fresh seafood, Time Out or the Chicken Hut for soul food, and Nanasteak. We also have great vegan/vegetarian spots.

Do - check out live jazz at the rooftop of The Durham hotel.

"Someone asked a similar question on the NC subreddit, so I'm going to echo what I wrote there as Dos. I'm sure I can some up with some Don'ts as well.  There are the perspectives of a Durham native who grew up downtown. 

**DO:**

* Get to know your neighbors. Stop and chat, get their phone numbers for emergencies, talk to neighbors before you call the cops about something. Be friendly and wave when you’re out walking or driving in your neighborhood. 
* Send your kids to public school (if you have them). Preferably your neighborhood school. Join the PTA. 
* Vote in our local elections, like city council and school board. 
* Support the arts (Third Friday events, the Nasher, music at Pinhook or Motorco, the Fruit, the Scrap Exchange, take a class at the Durham Arts Council). Hopefully they bring the Friday evening concert series at Central Park back, attending stuff like that is great for building community.
* Support our green spaces through the Ellerbee Creek Watershed Association or the Eno River Association. Hike and swim at the Eno.
* Shop at the farmer’s market or the co-op, and local businesses in general. Prioritize Black owned businesses, as someone else mentioned, is always a good look.
* Get involved in your neighborhood association if you've got one.

**Don't:**

* Buy a house with mature trees and then cut them all down. If you're worried about branches falling on your house, have an arborist come evaluate. Yes, many of the mature oaks are reaching the end of their lifespan. This does not mean they definitely need to come down right now. If you're going to take down trees, replace them with new ones. 
* Speed, especially down residential streets. Even if they are in town. Slow tf down.
* Talk shit about our city. A good natured, ""aw, shucks, wish we had X thing here"" is fine. A whiny, ""OMG, ALL the X here sucks! X is SOOOOO much better back where I came from"" is not fine.  The only reasonable reaction to this is ""Okay, cool, go back there then.""",t2_29po14we,nattybeaux,0,1648149518.0,0,t1_i1yvyp3,i1yvyp3,True,Budduhjay,t3_tmg0yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/tmg0yy/what_would_be_your_dos_and_donts_for_the_new/,What would be your do’s and don’ts for the new Durham Residents?,/r/bullcity/comments/tmg0yy/what_would_be_your_dos_and_donts_for_the_new/i1yvyp3/,48,r/bullcity,0,48

"EDIT: My comment ended up being long, but the gist of it is that you are right that owners need to do better, but it doesn’t mean that a few bad apples ruin the bunch. 

If we look at the 4.5M bites ([link to 2021 article instead of your **1994**)](https://maho-prentice.com/blog/2021/11/dog-bite-statistics-by-breed-2021/), that is 5% of the dog population (which likely has many repeat offenders / multiple injuries in one scenario), and 1% of those needed medical attention. Your source is also from 1994, when a lot more people had dogs as home protectors and did not train their dogs as well. 

There definitely are people who think their dog is well behaved, but they are not. I will give you that, and dog parents need to learn to do better. However, let’s go back to the origination of fear of dog and your comparison of driving. 

Comparing driving is like saying someone who has a fear of other cars on the road won’t go driving because there is a risk of an accident (fear of dogs). But others feel confident in their driving, even if they aren’t (poorly managed dog owners). Just because someone has a fear of driving doesn’t mean they will stop, they will just be more cognizant of their surroundings (A bar with dogs).

For someone who has a fear of dogs, at a place that has established it as dog friendly and openly encourages dogs, does not mean they will avoid going to a place allowing dogs - just the same as people with a fear of driving - they understand how to handle the situation and are cognizant of their surroundings. Just as those people with fear of an accident avoid traveling during peak rush hour, or drive on an LA freeway. 

This DOES NOT mean everyone should bring their dogs out, I 100% agree that many dog owners need to do better and know better. I encourage many people to do professional training when they complain about their dog issues and have a document I offer to share of all Force-Free trainers in the area. 

All in all - it also doesn’t mean businesses should change based on an audience of 33% of the population having a mild to severe fear of dogs. We all have our issues and adapt to them, and it does suck when someone wants to go somewhere and there is a deterrent. 

Tying in to the OP topic of dog friendly places, we explore locality. [Durham is a very dog friendly city,](https://bestofthebull.com/dog-friendly-durham-nc/) and a lot of their culture and events are planned to include them. 

Both of our arguments are valid. It all boils back down to the original owner of the event or establishment, and if they’re deemed dog friendly, it’s up to an individual with Cynophobia if they would like to go there. 

[Just like most people would think that this woman is a bad parent and shouldn’t bring her child out,](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/tlydld/mother_refused_to_stop_her_child_bad_habit_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), business owners should simply step in when a dog is misbehaving in the least bit and give a simple warning or ask them to leave if they wish to be a dog friendly establishment… Also ban extending leashes.",t2_96uj9,Itsdawsontime,1,1648143141.0,0,t1_i1yfo23,i1yfo23,False,KaleidoscopeNo108,t3_tlojr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/tlojr6/with_bull_mccabes_changing_its_dog_policy/,With Bull McCabe's changing its dog policy...,/r/bullcity/comments/tlojr6/with_bull_mccabes_changing_its_dog_policy/i1yfo23/,1,r/bullcity,0,1

"Learned these when I moved here about a year and a half ago:

*Do:*

**take advantage of the great universities in the area**. most of them offer classes you can sign up for without being directly admitted to the university.

**learn the walkable areas and cherish them**. sidewalks leave a lot to be desired here. downtown durham, especially around duke and american tobacco campus are great areas to walk around.

**eat at the food trucks.** I've had some glorious and unique food from those trucks. give them a chance.

**tour some bookstores.** I love durham bookstores and they're in some pretty cool areas to check out anyways. some of my favs are golden fig and the regulator. You can also usually get books cheaper there than walmart or target, which have poor selections anyway. Call ahead to see if they have used copies of what you're looking for.

**check an apartment out in person or at the** ***very least*** **on street view before signing that lease**. you could easily move to a sketchy part of town by accident.

**lock your car.** On that same note, don't leave cash or valuables where people can see them in your car. Out of all the cities and states I've lived in, my beater of a car was broken into twice in 6 months for the first time while here. This is not the place to leave your car unlocked and running while you make a quick trip into the gas station.

**Watch for deer or other animals crossing the road.** This may be a city but we are also surrounded by nature.

&#x200B;

*Don't:*

**Litter.** I'm so disappointed in the number of people I see flinging trash out of their cars on the road.

**Go grocery shopping between 5-6pm during the week.** It will take you longer to check out because of the line than to actually shop.

"When I first moved to Durham, I didn't have a car and had to use the bus and my bike to get around. I hate that I have to go all the way downtown to get anywhere. Basically, to get across town I have to take two busses and neither bus schedule ever lined up where I needed to go. Sundays schedules were even worse. It would take me two hours to get anywhere and two hours back. There need to be more stops, routes that go beyond just low-income housing areas, busses that run on the outskirts of town and overlap with other bus routes, more handicap access, and stops at more popular places. It is ridiculous that there is no bus stop near the social security office and the only way to get there is to walk on a road that has no sidewalks. 

The nearest bus stop near me is a 30-minute walk. They got rid of the ones that were closer. There are also no bike paths or trails near me, so basically the bus just isn't a very viable option for getting around.

"I avoid Xtreme park adventures for paintball due to safety issues they i witnessed years ago. (refs lifting masks, kids playing nerf walking through paintball protected areas with safety glasses etc.). Might be better now? Only thing I heard recently is they mixed the .50 cal low impact rental players with the .68 cal walkons which is terribly unfair for the .50 players. Maybe they didn't have enough players to have separate groups? They seem to be more airsoft focused than other fields I've seen in the area if you're going for that. 

Paintball central in Greensboro is more well run from what I've seen (as far as paintball standards) and has low impact options and enough players on a regular basis to walk onto. I've never seen major safety issues there, and I like the layouts for play much better. I don't remember seeing much airsoft there though.

My point is - If it is a debilitating amount a person isn’t likely to visit places like this in general.  

Moderate phobias absolutely, but as someone with  mild-Claustrophobia in packed spaces or stuffy insides I plan accordingly, take a moment to step away and calm myself, or leave as soon as I feel uncomfortable. 

It’s not always the extreme phobias. A lot of people with Cynophobia are fine with animals in their general space. Nearly 60% of families in the US have dogs and there is no way to avoid exposure.

"Are we even talking about what is in the main post anymore? “All the dogs **we** don’t like” who is we? I’m referencing that the fact this whole post is about where the well behaved dogs that are now longer allowed at Bull McCabe can go. Dogs have emotions, needs, wants. How is this any different than you and I? Just because they lack the tools to express those feelings doesn’t mean they should be ignored and neglected. It sounds like you put value into people when they have something to offer unlike a child/dog. The only difference is that the child can grow up and “contribute” one day.

It also feels like you’re saying the dog owners don’t know any better. Which is a weird way to agree with my pervious post on the “it’s not the dog, it’s the owner” part. Am I saying take your dog to the bar at 10pm on a Friday night? No because any sensible dog owner would know a place like that would be packed. Im saying to the people who have dogs who are ok with them being out in the public are allowed in a barcade any day of the week, any time of night, as long as they know what they’re getting into. Again, watch the dog whisperer once and a while. They’re not just instructionals how-tos to train your dog, they’re a deep dive into situational dog psychology, more so human psychology.

"Last month my partner and I just moved to Durham from Richmond, VA.  We found two good options around $1600. A 2bd/2ba near downtown with a fenced yard, and a 3 bd/1ba in Old West Durham w/ yard but no fence. If you can swing it comfortably, a budget up to 1800 will be plenty accommodating, but you don't have to spend that much.

Here are a couple of  options available right now. (But you probably won't want to start looking until w/in 30 days of your move out. Most places are not looking to lease 2 months in advance, but if you find a place you love you might be able to work with them.)

"Dogs are social creatures by nature, they are capable of being bored just like you and I. You say the person who takes their dog out doesn’t care about them. Yet they care enough to have them by their side? Going out provides mental stimulation, going on the same walk every day? Not very stimulating. They need to be able to take them to new places and give them new experiences. Just like you would with a child by your comparison, taking your dog into public is a way to teach them how to behave in public. There is no such thing as a bad dog, only misguided owners. Don’t let your personal bad experiences ruin future good experiences. Just because you’ve had experiences in your life that make you go “dog bad” doesn’t mean every single one fits this description. When someone gets into a car accident do you blame the car or the person who drove it there? I do hope your mother in law gets better but blind hatred is not the way. Make yourself a happier person by setting down the hate. 

This is going to fall on deaf ears but if you have Disney+, I recommend watching the Dog Whisperer tv series(or really any of Cesar Milan’s dog shows). In this series Cesar Milan goes across the states helping people with “broken” dogs who generally are going to be put down or re-homed. 95% of the cases the problem lies with the owner. Even if you hate dogs, don’t watch it as a “dog training” show, watch it as a psychology show instead.",t2_5ixkt,Valenaxxte,1,1648127660.0,0,t1_i1xd618,i1xd618,False,KaleidoscopeNo108,t3_tlojr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/tlojr6/with_bull_mccabes_changing_its_dog_policy/,With Bull McCabe's changing its dog policy...,/r/bullcity/comments/tlojr6/with_bull_mccabes_changing_its_dog_policy/i1xd618/,0,r/bullcity,0,0
