"Thanks for the continued discussion. I’m not sure how most of this relates to why we are here in the first place - do I believe an investment in SLV is prudent?  Given you allude to Silver as junk I assume you do not. That’s fine - i respect your right to have a view. I invested in Bitcoin last Sept - I’ve made 4x - I plan on being out this year - Q3 or Q4 after making 10-15x - how - that’s a different conversation.  But many have called Bitcoin “junk”.   Junk implies a lack of value. My Dad taught me 40 plus years ago “something is worth as much as someone else is willing to pay” - one man’s junk is another man’s fortune.

There is also a timing perspective to investing. Tesla was one if not best performing asset of 2020 if one held it for the full year. However one could easily find a 60 day consecutive period where an investor lost if they bought and sold during this period. I’m not a permanent Silver guy - I’m also not a guy who respects those calling for a market to crash and after 15 years of waiting it does and they claim - see I was right!! Nonsense - you were on the wrong side of the trade for 15 years and lost out on significant returns. I missed buying Bitcoin 8 years ago - I was wrong. However I recognize that while I couldn’t be more bullish on it from May 2020- Q3-Q4 2021 I’m incredibly bearish for it in 2022. Why - a story for a different time but that’s how I invest. I study I create a thesis and I invest accordingly. 

Given my thesis I bought Silver (via SLV) in Q4 2020 at roughly $25 with the thesis we would see north of $30 and possibly new all time highs - I also liked it as I thought my downside was limited to 10 percent. Something happened about a month ago and Silver spiked - in retrospect I should have exited and re-bought back in - I didn’t - I held as I decided a short term spike didn’t change my view.
Over the last couple weeks as long term interest rates spiked I also held - actually believing in my rest of year thesis I bought more.  I’m buying options as it is a short term trade and a means for me to accelerate returns if I’m correct.

Now back to our conversation.  Yes - when I refer to the Feds monthly purchases I refer to them buying debt instruments - Google it - This creates “money” - USD.

When I refer to govt stimulus - you have what was approved just after Covid, the $900B in December and the $1.9 Trillion approved last week. That’s money any way you slice it. The mechanics of it to me just confuses the issue - that “money” gets created and flows. In economics I was taught supply and demand - yes there is elasticity but generally as the supply of something goes up it’s value goes down. Yes as population rises there is a
need for more stuff - however our US population is not rising by trillions and trillions of people annually.

Trying to equate this additional “money”’to circulated dollar bills is not the point. In the coming few years we will likely be moving to a digital $ anyway (China already testing their own). Think of all the digital payments today - say Venmo - buying power is being transferred from one to another without any form of actual cash - no different when the Fed or Govt does it. The obligation of money far exceeds circulation - vastly. If everyone who has “purchasing power” demanded cash at the same time there is a humongous shortfall.  Our entire financial system would collapse - think of 2008 when there was a run on the banks - similar phenomenon. To me not at all the point. 

In general I trust science and fact.  I also recognize “facts” have become blurred. Social media feeds on it - the more I Google the more the algos send info my way potentially shaping my thinking and losing sight of fact. I have learned to trust what I see and what I personally experience. Bottom line is I don’t need a CPI number nor do I need to get caught up in a debate on its merits. My experience dictates my dollar today buys me far less than what it did a short time ago and I believe it will continue to erode.  I believe hard assets in USD terms will become increasingly valuable however not all by the same rate at the same time. The trick to investing is selecting the right ones at the right time. I have equities and real estate as my primary and for a near term trade Bitcoin and Silver. That’s why I’m on this forum.

"Thanks for the answer. To be clear, I fully understand the concept of asset inflation as opposed to the (to my mind and to others) outmoded CPI basket of goods. I also understand when expanding fiat currency chases a supply of goods that is increasing at a slower rate, hard assets will appreciate and that is where safety is. I've owned junk and other silver (and previously 1oz. gold rounds) for several decades. And most of my investing is in investment real estate, another good hard asset. 

Yet, I think you and I are talking at cross purposes - unless I misread you, your tone sounds vaguely antagonistic. I am not arguing that there is no inflation - nowhere did I say that. I am specifically trying to understand the nitty gritty mechanics of the concept printing money by the Fed, Treasury, Congress, US Mint or whomever & whatever is doing it that you and many others have referred to. 

Now, you did say something in that direction in your answer, but it sounds like you're more admonishing me than being instructive. Without saying it directly, you are challenging my quote from the Fed website that there is $2.05T in Federal Reserve notes in circulation. For an key point of factual reference, the Federal Reserve notes mentioned on their website, are the familiar $5, 10, 20, 50, & 100 dollar bills in your pocket. You don't really label each of the numbers you present (""the $900B"" (what?) ""...approved at the end of the year."" (stimulus checks? purchase of bonds/bills/notes?)). I suppose you're talking about the debt instruments because you reference Fed purchases. OK let's start there. The US debt securities or instruments are called Treasury Bonds (T Bonds), Treasury Bills (T Bills) or Treasury Notes. They are NOT Federal Reserve notes, they are interest bearing debt obligations, money owed by the US Treasury to the purchaser of the security.

If we are on target for, and continue through, to purchase $1.4T US debt securities in 2021, and if you meant we purchased $900B in 2020, then, yes, that blows clear through the $2.05 figure of ""Federal Reserve notes in circulation"" because it talking about different things, apples and oranges. But, is that ""money"" in circulation if the Fed is buying a debt security? ***Just where is this money coming from, that is my question. Is it actual printed US greenbacks?*** 

I've read in the past that the mechanism includes the Treasury issuing debt securities that are then exchanged with (sold to, or deposited in) the Social Security Trust Fund (raiding it in essence) for actual cash paid in by through the payroll deductions of workers. This would explain the phantom creation of money (""printing"")  in this way: Congress + President authorize payments (for stimulus checks, government expenditures, all the other garbage thrown in those bills); Treasury issues debt instruments (securities); sells them to the Trust Fund, foreign gov'ts., pension plans, insurance cos., etc.; receives cash in exchange for the securities; and then distributes the cash as directed by the aforementioned bills & authorizations enacted by Congress and signed by the President. The result is all of that cash taken from the SSTN and leaving it with a pile of IOUs, hence the frequently discussed problem of the bankrupt Trust Fund, is now re-cycled back into circulation to pay for all the stuff Congress authorized. 

That's what I meant by trying to understand what printing money ACTUALLY means. I've always understood it to be a metaphor as explained above. Do you know if I've got that correctly or not? That's what I was asking. Or is there some other mechanism by which the government can simply order the printing of money? 

To fill in the gaps for those that don't see how this could be the metaphorical equivalent of printing money, I'll explain that inflation, rising tax rates, increased social security deductions, and growing population all increase the required pool of dollars in the economy by increasing the amount of money flowing through the government and the SSTN, giving the perfect smoke and mirrors cover to play the game I've outlined above. With an ever-increasing amount of money slushing around in the Trust Fund, and investors willing to buy the securities (for US Dollars or for foreign currencies readily convertible to the US Dollars) the government can keep issuing more and more debt. The ""money in circulation"" does not need to be in the form of actual paper. It can simply be a bond (paper or electronic ""street"" entry).",t2_10gjbw,StiffHappens,0,1615696100.0,0,t1_gqvbjgt,gqvbjgt,False,Comfortable-Luck-362,t3_m45wxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLV/comments/m45wxd/selling_slv_stock_at_a_3_pt_loss_what_do_you_think/,Selling $SLV stock at a 3 pt loss.

"In the spirit of taking your questions as genuine I would encourage you to do real DD. For me circulation in the manner you apply it isn’t relevant. I’m not inclined to educate you on all the work I’ve done - you do your own and create a thesis - If different than mine I respect that - I wish you luck.

I will say this: 2020 infusion - I look at Fed monthly purchases, value of various Covid stimulus programs plus the $900 billion approved at the end of the year

2021 - see continued Fed monthly purchases (so far on target for $1.4 Trillion) plus $1.9 trillion stimulus just approved (truth is this is on top of $900 billion referred to above that really would show effect in 2021). Let’s see if this is all or if there will be more - it’s only March.

You want to argue there is no inflation - fine - I look at what my $ buys me in food, gas, etc. What about asset prices (stocks, real estate, etc) - to me that’s inflation. The govt can measure it any way they want - I look at my life and what my $1 buys me today versus the past - a heck of a lot less than it used to.  I believe it has and will continue to be exacerbated by the creation of new dollars at an alarming rate.

As a result and for other reasons I touted I like silver. Certainly I could be wrong. That’s the beauty of research and investing. I certainly wouldn’t give anyone advice other than do your own DD and only enter a trade if you believe in it and know why you are entering - never cause someone else is.

"Can someone please explain the relationship of these two claims?

/StudDiamond says below: Last year the Fed printed over 30 percent of every dollar every produced. This year we are adding upwards of another $4 Trillion.

[FederalReserve.gov](https://FederalReserve.gov) reports on its website today:  As of February 10, 2021, there was $2.05 trillion worth of Federal Reserve notes in circulation.

Now, current US population estimates (annual increase) \[[https://www.macrotrends.net\]](https://www.macrotrends.net])

2021: 332,915,073 (0.58%)

2020: 331,002,651 (0.59%)

2019: 329,064,917 (0.60%)

Therefore, $2.05T in circulation means approx. $6,158. per person. Of course wealth is not measured by dollars in your bank account alone, but by material possessions, stocks, bonds, houses, cars, etc. But the theory that government printing of money will create mega-inflation is difficult to understand. I'm not sure what 'printing money' means, as in, whence comes the authority to create the Benjamins in what numbers? To keep the amount of $ in circulation per person at par requires creating about $1.2B in currency per year (0.58% growth.)

"For what it’s worth, my thesis for silver - hedge vs inflation. Yes interest rates rising hurt us badly - the hope is with all the Fed spending and stimulus, rates continue to rise and the Fed has to come in with yield control. Also with the US far ahead of Europe in vaccinations so opening is ahead, USD strengthens. Just me - I think this is all temporary. Bitcoin will fly - it’s just started but that’s a different subject with a 4 yr cycle... Gold and silver should have their day - It will just take longer than I thought. Last year the Fed printed over 30 percent of every dollar every produced.  This year we are adding upwards of another $4 Trillion. How can’t the USD not erode in value versus stable assets?  To me it’s not a question of will it but when will it.  Add in silver need in clean energy and I remain hopeful for second half of year.  Now I’m open to being wrong and it could take longer but I haven’t sold and even bought more lowering my average cost - I own 30,000 Jan 2022 calls at $30 strike - if I have to move out another year I will but certainly nothing yet.

I’m not sure this is about a short squeeze on SLV at all. The squeeze to be had if at all will be in the physical. Consequently any pressure on physical delivery will result in higher prices. We can see some of that already with the gold silver ratio coming down as silver over performs relative to gold. The action by the participants in this group and others world wide has seen some upward pressure on the silver price. I imagine if everyone holds onto physical and buys PSLV or equivalent instead of SLV additional upward pressure on the spot price of silver will continue. Of course when you see some of the crazy dumping that goes on periodically one knows that there is manipulation. To get rid of this it seems to me that people need to take delivery or buy instruments that are backed by physical silver.

Mammoth crime that continues before our eyes. The Banksters are fleecing the public and no one says a word. The Regulators know and are fully aware - but the regulators don’t Regulate. Instead they turn a blind eye while all the checks and balances in our system fail us. I think what is most upsetting is that our Government who is supposed to protect us stands silently by. Worse they have secretly prevented the small guys from knowing they were being cheated by the Banksters.

At this point JPM is about to get away with the biggest crime humanity has ever witnessed. Since 2008 following the takeover of Bear Stearns they have systematically crushed the price of silver screwing the unsuspecting public. At the same time they acquired a Billion ounces of Silver at criminally manipulated prices.

"Not a short term squeeze, but 3-6 months out the shorts can not cover.  The only controlling factor is the supply of 1000 oz. bars ($27,000).  When they run out the price of silver will go up, up and up.  I believe $50, then $100, and at the bubble top close to $150. Yes, maybe I am crazy.

What am I going to to do? Okay.  Here is the current exact scenario.  Monday morning  (pricing remaining at more or less current levels) I am going to buy 1-100 oz. bar and also a good spread of SLV options.     My current thinking is Sept $25's, Jan $30's, and some way out $50's.

Can I afford it?  Yes, sort of.

Can I not afford it?  No, I do not think so.

Good luck to me and you!!

Be patient.  I am not an advisor, but by Jesus this is what I am going to do.

As a footnote, support your etf, option, and stock purchases (miners) with a small purchase of physical silver.

Who was it out there asked me to respond?  Well, I will tell you this: my answer is probably worth a little more than what you paid for it.

"I'm bullish on Silver,keep buying SLV OR PSLV( **Sprott Physical Silver Trust),slowly not in a** hurry, fundamentals will take it higher. There is a dislocation between the physical silver price and the silver coins. The price of the latter is much higher than the former.They will try to stop it increasing margins for futures contracts.

The dislocation is already present in silver. Paper silver futures and options will be in trouble but CME regulators will try to stop the silver rally. Of all the comments I have researched, price targets for silver are low,because they are talking about the nominal price,not the inflation adjusted one. They are not taking in account the QE without limits of Central Banks of major economies,nor their fiscal deficits and balloned debts. Which have caused fiat currencies .

It is time for a change in the monetary system,the dollar is a fiat currency and the Bretton Woods accord is dead. But major changes panic monetary authorities, and they prefer maintaning the status quo.

"Thank you. Finally someone who speaks my language. When I heard the Reddit/GME crew were planning to get into SLV, I decided to make a Reddit account (which I named BuyPhysicalSilver) so I could help educate about how bloody important the precious metal is and how buying physical silver can break the banksters illegal cap on its price and then literally change the monetary world for the better. Little did I know just how short sighted so many people are. I've been accused of being a bot, a hedge fund spy and all sorts of things.

Exactly as the guy in the video said.........these hedge funds and banksters couldn't care less about people buying up some worthless GME stocks. What does scare the living crap out of them is the public waking up to their manipulation of silver and gold (money) and loads of people buying physical metals. Silver is the Achilles heel of the entire corrupt monetary system. Without their manipulative cap on the price of silver, it should be trading at around $200 an ounce RIGHT NOW. The extraction ratio of gold to silver is 1 to 7.......meaning for every ounce of gold mined, 7 ounces of silver are mined. Yet the price is around 1 to 70!!! This proves just how undervalued silver is. The only way the silver to gold price ratio is so out of whack is because of the price suppression. For the love of god, wise up to this strategic metal (silver). Do some research and think about getting rid of some of your worthless fiat paper currency and trade it for real money (physical silver). We are heading for insane levels of inflation and the death of the dollar. In this environment, it is crucial to have something real and tangible to transfer your wealth into the next monetary paradigm.",t2_a1y1donp,BuyPhysicalSilver,0,1612301155.0,0,t1_gls853p,gls853p,True,Hefty_Ad4379,t3_lathqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLV/comments/lathqp/stop_thinking_small_a_message_to_wsb_et_al_re/,Stop Thinking Small!

"Absolutely agree with you.  Allowing the Fed, a private bank, to control our money has robbed people of a fair interest on their savings for years and transferred those trillions to the top. Without QE this stock market wouldn't be at all time highs.  Since Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971 the dollar has lost 80% of its value.  There is only 3% of the dollars purchasing power left as compared to its inception by the Fed in1913.  The central bankers are trying to set up a global neofeudal technocracy.  They are at war with us.  Silver and gold HONEST MONEY, are their enemy.  A rising gold and silver price indicate a failing dollar.  If we take control of the physical silver a 1.4 trillion dollar space at $26/oz. the paper (comex) will separate from the physical price.  This is happening as we speak.  We can collectively make the current system of monetary surpression moot.  If we don't act many will suffer and die.  This is not hyperbole.

" **Silver is one of the critical raw materials that will support a low-carbon future**.  Earlier this month, The Silver Institute released a study entitled “Silver’s Growing Role in the Automotive Industry,” which contained some revealing data underscoring the opportunity for the white metal.  For instance, global vehicle production is slated to increase from a pandemic-suppressed 74 million units in 2020 to about 100 million units in 2025.  But as the following chart illustrates, **the share of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles is projected to shrink from 90% to around 70% during that time, while hybrid and battery-electric vehicles fill the gap through 2025, rising toward 30 million units sold on a combined annual basis.**",t2_9es0ra67,James_Gatz_IX,0,1612257793.0,0,t1_glpnjui,glpnjui,True,[deleted],t3_laplbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLV/comments/laplbq/upvote_slv_listen_i_am_back_with_due_dilligence/,"UPVOTE $SLV.

"I've been a professional for 15+ years bud.  Completely on my own.  Not a shill.  You're missing the picture.  People have tried to corner the market in silver several times in the past.  Look up Hunt Brothers.  It's actually doable.  Everyone is trashing the trade cause it's taking dollars away from the GME trade. I get that.  I just don't understand why you wouldn't wanna pivot into something that actually has inherent value and a super limited supply.  People have been talking about a possible  Comex default for YEARS.  That's when they don't have enough silver to meet demand.  There's no telling where the price could go.  This is why other institutions have jumped on board with idea.  There's never been anybody powerful enough to pull this off but that didn't keep people from trying.  Right now, these forums have that power.  I know a lot about silver.  Bought 5000oz in the futures market last year at the end of march when the markets were in chaos.  Melted it down, turned around and flipped it on ebay.  Only have 500oz left.  Never dreamed there could be an opportunity like this.  It's unfortunate the trade is being trashed.  I'm pretty sure the high in gamestop was made on wednesday.

"They have the power to bring down silver by issuing more paper shorts. I would look it up I don’t feel comfortable explaining it cause I’m worried I might get some things wrong. 

The question I have is: Is the price of SLV going up because people are buying an SLV or is it because people are ordering physical silver. If people are ordering physical silver then we’re Gucci. If not then I’m a little nervous. I know SLV claims that they go out and purchase physical silver...butttt I don’t buy it there’s so many sketchy things going on there. My worry is that the price of silver it’s going to stay the same and the price of our silver ETS is going to skyrocket. This is because these firms have stored up so much physical silver that they can cash in the metal for shares and do a mass selloff or issue out more paper shorts to bring down the price and cover their shorts. It’s a great way for them to make money too because by cashing in their physical silver they’re actually making a decent amount of money off of the difference between the ETF and the metal.",t2_5nbv8zvt,kkx50,0,1612186946.0,0,t1_glli140,glli140,True,zerohero1984,t3_l9zf1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLV/comments/l9zf1l/buying_more_slv/,BUYING MORE $SLV!,/r/SLV/comments/l9zf1l/buying_more_slv/glli140/,0,r/SLV,0,0

"Hey there, I'm interesting in buying SLV options too. However, I'm not clear on the last point on pretty much every training video and tips I've read...

Let's use your contract that you have. I know you're getting 100 shares for each contract you buy. In your case, lets say you bought one contract for $100. You would pay the seller that $100 premium, then hope for the SLV to finish above $30.50 before the contract expires. 

Lets say at the time of expiration SLV is at $35/share and you exercise the option to buy. Do you just get those 100 shares? Do you not pay any extra to exercise the option? Like you don't have to pay market price? The guy selling the put just gets screwed in this case?

"I can't wait to see those crooked bankster shorts fry.  They are short SLV ---- but what they really are is short mountains of paper silver.  They have a short position of HALF A YEARS mine production (approx 400 million oz) concentrated among 8 large collusive banks.  They are already down $13 Billiion on these trades!

They are making  a last ditch effort HEAD FAKE by apparently LEASING physical Silver from the biggest crook of all -  JPM in a desperate attempt to hold the price down (pretending there is plenty of physical silver by delivering it to SLV).  But their DEBACLE grows dangerously perilous and since our REGULATORS are in bed with them this seems the only way to break the back of this SHAMEFUL practice. Our Government has turned it's back on small guys....

This nonsense has been going on for nearly 40 years and it's about time some fairness and payback to the small guys that have been repeatedly fleeced by these crooks in a RINSE WASH REPEAT cycle of manipulating the price of silver down by flooding the markets with FAKE paper short SUPPLY and then covering their shorts at an obscene profit.  

If we individuals buy lots of SLV and physical silver and SLV options the demand for silver will likely overwhelm the paper shorts.  And remember the margin requirements allow banksters to leverage about 10:1!!! A 10% move down wipes out positions completely and triggers margin calls.

"Hey guy!
no pumping going on here. just got back into town from snowboarding trip.
I stick with physical silver and gold. I personally like American Silver Eagles and 90% silver. Back when the pandemic started i was one of two coin shops opened in the area. Everyone who came into the store stuck with ASE, Canadian maples and any other government issues coins. 
They also went for 90% which was a cheaper way to get fractional silver.
But my point to this post was that i’ve been in the industry for over 20+ years and i have never seen these kind of demands for silver and gold.
If you are looking to invest i would def stick with physical. I haven’t dabble in SLV. So i wouldn’t be much help to answer that question.

"I think everyone is starting to notice that retail precious metal dealers are running out of inventory or saying they can’t sell until silver market opens Sunday night for pricing. Last night the dealer I usually buy from online had monster boxes of maples and eagles. This morning..none, zip, ZERO. How much has public media even discussed the recent movement in the silver market..none, zip, ZERO. Just think when this becomes the lead story on the network news. Momentum starts slowly then all at once. What part of the curve do you want to jump in at? Have you ever heard of silver going to zero in history? It’s been around a long time and what I do know it hasn’t gone up in value like it should have been for many years so it’s got a long, long way to run. It also can be attacked in many, many ways it is not just a single stock that controls its market like GameStop, AMC, etc. that the brokerages can block you from buying. They can’t shut silver down but you have brokerages like Robinhood slowing our movement, by limiting share purchases.

"People have to buy physical silver and take it off the market. This is the very BEST and SAFEST way to break the paper manipulation and help the price of silver get to where it should be. Based on the 1980 high price of $50, simply adjusted for inflation, silver should be priced at around $200 an ounce.......TODAY. But the COMEX uses paper contracts for silver that doesn't even exist, to keep the price down. 

Silver is real money and is the Achilles heel of corrupt fiat debt based monetary system.
The manipulation has been a blessing for those who have been stacking at suppressed prices over the years. Take this soon to end opportunity and get physical silver at these insanely cheap prices before they lose control of the price suppression and the price explodes. Not to mention the demand for silver will vastly increase as the world moves towards electric and solar energy. 

Remember, for every ounce of gold miners extract out of the ground, they extract about 7 ounces of silver. That's a real world gold to silver extraction ratio of 1 to 7..........yet the price is at around 1 to 70. That shows just how insanely undervalued silver is relative to gold.

"On Friday there was big volume of 1 year leaps on SLV going out to January. Staggered at strikes 25, 26, 30, 35, 39 and 40.

CALlING ALL BALLERS... The trade to do and has to be done in size is to go out and buy out of the money Call Options at staggered levels across varying maturities When the dealers sell these options to them they hedge themselves buly buying a delta weighted by the amount of the option. The Delta on January 2022 40 strike vallis around 21%, so they would have to buy 21 shares of SLV for each Call Option sold. As the price of SLVgoes up, the Delta on the options increases, so if SLV went to 32, the Delta would go to let's say 35, so they would have to buy 14 more shares putting increased pressure on the shares to rise. As the price approaches the strike price of the call option, the Delta would increase to just over 50% ending up in a self fulfilling prophecy...

this comment may be true, but the scope of manipulation is measured in Billion $ fines.  JPM was fined $1.26B just five months ago...  it's almost like JPM has been suppressing precious metals to keep buying cheap...  A surge in silver prices may help JPM (and  crush whomever is shorting).

"It will all change with Basel iii in june. This is the program that is supposed to make all paper underwriters have to have physical to back up the paper. Considering SLV alone hold 500mm ounces, Comex short account for 250mm ounces. This doesn’t even take into consideration the March “slated for delivery” on the comex. Last I checked it was around 500mm ounces. Annual Silver production is less than 900mm world worldwide.
