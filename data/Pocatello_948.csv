Last week a family and their chaplain could not reach the bedside of their dying father.  
  
Why? Politicians.  
  
Extremists gathered in front of St. Luke’s Medical Center in Boise to wave signs, block traffic, and swap conspiracy theories. The catalyst was a malnourished infant. The baby had been taken into state custody as an extraordinary effort to save the baby’s life.  
  
Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, alongside far right activist Ammon Bundy, was one of the politicians who saw the baby as a chance to raise her profile. That’s just what she did.  
  
In truth, I think we’ve gotten used to outrageous behavior for the sake of political gamesmanship. It gets easy to tune out that kind of behavior. It gets easy to respond to outrage with a shrug and to tell ourselves that it isn’t serious.  
  
McGeachin helped whip up a crowd outside of St. Luke’s to the point that hospital security stopped everyone from coming and everyone from going out—for well over an hour. In the meantime, a distraught family was left outside with an agitated mob while their family member was robbed of seeing the people he loved for one last time.  
  
I think of this family. I think of the craven treatment of a baby’s misfortune.  
  
What it means is that we need to be outraged by what is outrageous again. No, I am not talking about losing all sense of decency and attacking people. Rep. Priscilla Giddings (running to replace McGeachin) republished a link that shared the addresses of law enforcement officers with the angry mob that McGeachin and Bundy were prodding. That’s despicable. I am definitely not talking about simply raging.  
  
I mean that we need to work to make sure every Idahoan knows that Janice McGeachin was the highest ranking elected state official to speak at a white nationalist rally. We need to make sure every Idahoan knows that McGeachin is absolutely unapologetic for speaking at a place that cheered racists and anti-semites. She didn’t care that at the same time she spoke, the racist who organized the event led the crowd in a round of applause for Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.  
  
That is outrageous and outrage is the right response.  
  
It’s chilling to me that McGeachin was ever elevated to the role of lieutenant governor. I have called on her to resign. I want her to resign because she has betrayed our trust and her words and actions endanger us all.  
  
It’s troubling to me that more of Idaho’s leaders haven’t called on McGeachin to resign. Do you recall last August when Gov. Brad Little traveled out of state so McGeachin used his absence to try to mobilize the Idaho National Guard? At the time, Gov. Little called the move “an affront to the Idaho Constitution.” House Speaker Scott Bedke (also running to replace McGeachin) called it “an abuse of her political office.”  
  
Neither of them called for her resignation, despite having just decried outrageous, illegal behavior from the person who is a heartbeat away from being governor.  
  
It is without hyperbole that I urge us all to understand that these positions come with immense power. We must trust the people we elect because we are trusting them to make life and death decisions.  
  
There is no telling what McGeachin will do between now and the end of her term. I encourage every Idahoan to call on her to resign. Write her a letter. Write a letter to the editor. Wave signs–in places where you aren’t disrupting the lives of innocent people.   
  
I am promising every Idahoan that I will treat the office of lieutenant governor with the solemnity and respect the position requires. Let her outrageous behavior be the catalyst it takes for you to vote for me.   
  
I promise to lead with honor, humility, compassion, and a deep respect for the law.",t2_d3dg1,OriginalimPoster,0,1648058460.0,0,t1_i1tp9s7,i1tp9s7,True,Cookie_Cutter_Cook,t3_tkelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pocatello/comments/tkelaw/outrageous_terri_pickens_manweiler_for_idaho_lt/,Outrageous | Terri Pickens Manweiler for Idaho Lt.

"Hey there, native Pocatellen here, I think you'll find a lot of resources (not as many as I'd wish), there are a few programs that I'm sure would help you as a single mother. Most places in town are safe to live, there are a couple of sketchy neighborhoods but for the most part it is a decent community. Sometimes you'll get lucky and have good neighbors who will watch out for each other, but I'd be lying if I said that is the rule. 

What do you like to do for work? There are a lot of places hurting for workers right, they haven't restaffed since covid, and a lot of places are running skeleton crews because of people getting sick (it sounds like 50/50 flu or covid). I'm sure you wouldn't have too hard of a time finding some work.

I would call our health and welfare office and ask them about resources for going back to school, working and living as a single mother.

"We moved here in July of last year, my wife accepted a teaching position at ISU. 

Not sure where you'd be locating from, but I think it's super safe here. We got a house in the University neighborhood, and my wife walks to work everyday solo, never had a single issue. We also walk to restaurants, breweries, and the grocery store. There are obviously some less than desirable areas, but if you do your research you'll find out which neighborhoods could work for you. I will say the cost of living here is pretty darn good.

All I know is I moved here from Tennessee and I am doing everything I can to move back.... I know you didn’t ask for negative information but the people here are freaking rude! Every fast food restaurant I go to they mess up my food and are rude to me. I get flipped off quite a bit and I literally don’t know what I did to get flipped off for. Probably because I have a Tennessee license plate idk The kids on school buses are disrespectful and yell mean things out the bus Windows. I sat at a red light for not even a min waiting on the car in front of me and I get honked at. The landlords here don’t follow the laws. Every apartment requires a 700 credit score which is ridiculous! Considering all of them look like shit. there are way too many people here and one Walmart. The jobs pay shit unless you work at the hospital as a nurse or something with a degree. And even still you can make way more somewhere else. I never understand why people move here... not to mention the police here think they can do whatever they want and use excessive force on woman and search them with out warning instead of having a female officer do it like they are supposed to. Let me tell you this I have never been in trouble with the law my whole life and because my old landlord broke the law and I was yelling at him in the middle of daylight I got in trouble for disturbance of peace. I got arrested two weeks after on a warrant they had out for me! How ridiculous is that? yeah I don’t recommend this town to anyone especially if you come from southern hospitality. I will give you some advice if you do move here which it looks like you are stay away from a man named Brandon terry! He is a realtor and he breaks laws and is a liar and a Creep to younger women!

"Not sure about a realtor, but I just moved into the [Northgate Apartments](https://www.thenorthgateapartments.com/) in the new Northgate area in Poky and have enjoyed it thus far.  Their floorplans' rent span your range.

If you want to feel like you're outside town, then you'll want to look at a bench, south toward the Mink Creek area, or northwest to Philbin and Rio Vista Roads.  The East bench feels very suburban sprawl-y, Philbin/Rio Vista feel like the doorstep to country living, and the West bench manages to be a sort of a mix of the two.  South is forming into a sort of McMansion and McRanch area.

As far as good areas in Poky, I wouldn't want to live between Arthur and 5th streets, and I wouldn't walk down N Harrison after dark.  Otherwise, Poky is not a bad town to live in.

I've not used a moving service, but wish I had.

The northern areas are serviced by [TruFiber](https://www.mytrufiber.com/), which has been a good ISP in my experience.  They're  some sort of a subsidiary of [Optix](http://optixmedia.net/site/).  Good speeds, but I got some enraging ~10s disconnects daily while gaming before moving.  I never let them know about it, but they had good customer service whenever I contacted them, and was likely local to that house because Northgate has Optix and I have yet to have any connection issues.  Before TruFiber came in, we used [Sparklight](https://www.sparklight.com/).  It was good and reliable, but they started using data caps and associated extra fees.  Still much, much better than the other option we had of CenturyLink; horrible customer service, horribly inconsistent internet service, horrible experience.

Winters are very hit-or-miss, but Pocatello does the best job I have ever seen of keeping the streets clear.  Someone else in the thread mentioned snow tires and, while I think they're great and generally recommend them, I would not consider them necessary.  My parents swear by and have gotten by with all-season tires through Poky's winters for longer than I have been alive.

My favorite local restaurants are, in no particular order: Chapala, El Herradero (Truck), Jumbo's Cafe, Goody's, Fifth Street Bagelry, Puerto Vallarta, Las Penitas, Sumisu, Thai Zap, Thai Paradise, Thai Kitchen, Villano's, Cafe Tuscano, Sandpiper's, and Jaker's.  (Jaker's is a chain, but it is local.  That said, the Idaho Falls location has *much* better service and atmosphere, which is important with how expensive it is.)

As far as flights, generally the answer is flying in and out of SLC.  There are one or two daily flights between Pocatello and SLC, though; I'd compare the cost of renting in SLC and driving up vs flying into Poky and renting here.  Probably not worth the cost, but it may be worth it to avoid Utahn drivers.  You may also consider looking at a smaller airline like [Allegiant](https://www.allegiantair.com/).  They have limited locations, but they fly out of Idaho Falls, which is only about 40 minutes away from Pocatello.  Flying Allegiant was always cheaper when my family would visit Arizona vs. driving down ourselves.",t2_641l1,Mode_,0,1638937549.0,0,t1_hnoj3el,hnoj3el,True,OriginalimPoster,t3_rb9461,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pocatello/comments/rb9461/moving_to_pocatello_have_some_questions/,"Moving to Pocatello, have some questions.",/r/Pocatello/comments/rb9461/moving_to_pocatello_have_some_questions/hnoj3el/,2,r/Pocatello,0,2

"Hey there, I just moved to Pocatello about a month ago as well.  
I can't speak much for leasing as we bought our place, but I worked with Chris Robinson to buy my current place. I can't speak for how he would be for finding rentals, but we are happy with him for buying our home.  He's been awesome and kept in touch after we moved in to make sure we got squared away with stuff.  We're still unfortunately waiting for internet to get installed, but he's been barking up our ISPs tree to get us connected (our neighborhood has a deal with Direct Communications to get us connected out here).  


\> We are planning on going towards the Northern or North East part of town, are these good areas to live? Seems like they are kind of around the outsides of the town which is what we want.  
The Northern part of Pokey definitely seems to be nicer than the southern part of town, but that's kind of subjective. The only ""crappy"" areas I'd label seem to be in ""downtown"" near the university. It's older, but I wouldn't say I feel unsafe there or would be afraid to leave my car parked there over night.  I'm personally out on the eastern end of town, but driven a fair amount around the north eastern parts. There's some newer apartments going in near Chubbuck and Olympus that looked pretty nice. There's a bunch of new construction going on near there with some new shopping planned for the future as well as I understand.  

&#x200B;

\> What is a moving service we can use in the area if you have had a good experience with one?  
When we moved here, we loaded a UHaul truck mostly ourselves from where we came from. When we got here it was mostly the same story but I hired some help to get the heavy things for us into our place.  UHaul offered some help through their own service and it was like $80/hr for two guys. Specifically we used ""Moving Professionals of Idaho"". They were good enough, didn't have any complaints.

  
\> How are the internet providers and who is the best? Work from home and gamers so we would want a good connection.  
As far as I know, there's two big players for internet here. CenturyLink and TrueFiber/Direct Communications (I believe the former is more aimed for residential and the latter for commercial). My parents live on the eastern benches and had CenturyLink and converted over to TrueFiber and they've been happy with them. Their service is rated for a gig. I can't speak for latencies yet as I don't have internet yet at my place, but I'd imagine with fiber it'll be plenty fast and non-latent.  


\> What are winter conditions like? I've done some of my own research over the past months and it doesn't seem to get too heavy of snowfall in this area. Winter tires needed?  


Pocatello as I understand it is a bit odd compared to the rest of south eastern Idaho. We don't get nearly as cold as Idaho Falls and don't get as much snow. My folks have been here two winters now and a sibling of mine has been here around 5. I've never noticed an obscene amount of snow. Seems like it usually melts off in a day or two in the valley. I don't think you'd need winter tires.  


\> What are your favorite non-chain restaurants?  


I'm still on the hunt for this myself as I love food. Pocatello unfortunately isn't a hotspot for cultural diversity, so if you like ethnic food it may be a bit lacking.  There seems to be a few Thai and Indian places.  I tried Thai Kitchen (on Hiline and Alameda) and Saffron (on Yellowstone kind of near Alameda) last week and was pretty happy with both.  I tried out ""The Works"" today for lunch and it was a bit pricey but a good sandwich.  Tons of great Mexican, I personally like Puerto Vallarta and El Caporal.    


\> We are flying there in January to view some properties, is it better to fly into Salt Lake City and rent a car to go up or fly into one of the neighboring towns? Seems like its cheaper to fly from where I live to Salt Lake city by good chunk.  


I'd definitely think renting in SLC would be the easiest way to go. The Pokey airport is pretty small. You may also check Idaho Falls but I'm not sure it'd be much cheaper. Guess you'd have to ultimately crunch the numbers to see what works for you as far as flights and rentals go, but I can tell you in a rented sedan (you'd probably get a Chevy Cruze or Nissan Altima or something) you'd probably burn about half a tank of gas one way driving here. It's about a 2.5 hour drive from the SLC airport to Pokey.",t2_12jfkb,Korzag,0,1638913374.0,0,t1_hnn5gn4,hnn5gn4,True,OriginalimPoster,t3_rb9461,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pocatello/comments/rb9461/moving_to_pocatello_have_some_questions/,"Moving to Pocatello, have some questions.",/r/Pocatello/comments/rb9461/moving_to_pocatello_have_some_questions/hnn5gn4/,2,r/Pocatello,0,2
"Not sure on a realtor for renting.

Aside from some of the trailer parks in town, there really aren't any ""bad"" areas in town, compared to a larger city.  There isn't a street in town I wouldn't walk down alone at night, which can't be said about any of the bigger cities I've lived in.  I prefer the east benches, but that's what I'm used to.  The city is growing towards the north so keep that in mind.  What was secluded farmland a few short years ago is now getting developed into subdivisions.

Not sure on moving service.

I've been plenty happy with Sparklight for internet (formerly Cable One).  I think I pay something like $65 /mo for 300 mbps.  I work on a computer at home all day and game casually in the evenings a few times a week, with not even a slight hiccup in our internet.

Winters are hit or miss.  Last winter I think I shoveled my driveway once.  5 years ago, we had feet of snow in our yard and I shoveled at least weekly, if not more, on average.  If you're living in the benches, you may very well want snow tires.  The snow line tends to fall somewhere between the valley and the benches, so while you might have rain in the valley you could get 6"" of snow 2 min out of town in the benches.  They are better at plowing than in the past, but sometimes it takes a couple days to get residential streets plowed.  I've always thought snow tires were well worth the investment.  A set of snow tires is often as much as or less than your insurance deductible if you were to get in a wreck.

Lots of pretty solid local food options.  Nothing amazing, but lots of good options.  All depends on what you like and what you're used to.  For a few quick ideas:  sandwiches = Goodies, The Works; Mexican = El Herradero, Chapalas; breakfast/brunch = Abracadabra's, Butterburrs; BBQ = Shawn's Smoke and Fire, Blackhawk (food truck); Japenese = Sumisu, Fuji; brew/pub = Brick 243, Jim Dandy's, Sandtrap, Portneuf Valley Brewing, Off the Rails; Italian = Vilano's, Buddy's; fancier = The Yellowstone Restaurant, Cafe Tuscano, Sandpiper.  Honorable mention for dessert = Scoops N Sliders.

I prefer to fly into Salt Lake, myself.  For example, a friend just flew in to Pocatello.  They had a 7 hour layover in Salt Lake... it's a 2-2.5 hr drive, so they wasted an extra 5 hours of their trip sitting in the airport unnecessarily for the ""convenience"" of flying into Pocatello.  Sometimes Idaho Falls isn't bad, but we mostly use Salt Lake.",t2_13j74j,TurboMP,0,1638912831.0,0,t1_hnn45ec,hnn45ec,True,OriginalimPoster,t3_rb9461,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pocatello/comments/rb9461/moving_to_pocatello_have_some_questions/,"Moving to Pocatello, have some questions.",/r/Pocatello/comments/rb9461/moving_to_pocatello_have_some_questions/hnn45ec/,10,r/Pocatello,0,10
"It’s usually cheaper to fly into SLC but sometimes there are really good deals into Pocatello or Idaho Falls.  I would not recommend Boise to fly into as the drive isn’t as nice.  North and North East (Chubbuck and Highland or Northgate) areas are really nice areas.  Both areas have access to good high speed internet.  I would recommend snow tires, you don’t always need them, but when you do, you really do need them.  Winter conditions vary from year to year.  We’ve been in a drought, so cold but not a lot of snow, but in a good snow year we get a lot.  The city is ready for it and does a pretty good job on the main roads.  The smaller streets can be a mess.  Restaurants, Dumbos for breakfast is a must,  Buddy’s is awesome, and I like mama Inez for takeout.

We have more turnover in the summer, but we also have more applications.  We never put out signs. We never advertise in any way. We know enough people that someone qualified calls at least twice a week to see if anything is about to be vacant. As a transplant this is probably depressing to hear. 

If you are looking to buy a house in the future you go to the top of our list. Assuming you use my partner as an agent. That accounts for the majority of our turn over. We really haven’t been jacking up rent at market pace so our tenants are unlikely to randomly find something better and leave.

"It really varies from neighborhood to neighborhood.  For example, up on Satterfield Drive there are literally bus loads of people lining the length of the street.  Seriously, people will bus large groups up there.

Beyond that, it's a crapshoot and would vary from street to street.  The trunk or treat stuff has been really popular, especially last year with COVID, and it wasn't uncommon for many thousands of people to turn out at those events with hours-long lines just to get in.

My best advice is to buy candy you like, because there's a good chance you'll be the one eating most of it.

"Thanks. And wow that’s what successful planning can do with four square miles. I worked for the city of Chubbuck police Dept back when Home Depot was looking for a spot for their new store. Then Mayor Cotant was very progressive about bringing them in. What followed was Walmart, Lowe’s, pine ridge mall and everything you see now. There’s plenty of room in Pocatello, but obviously Chubbuck  had been managed so much better. I think Annexing is why Pocatello wants some of what we’ve built. I say elect a better Mayor and progressive city councilors. Make good deal’s with potential and make sure to give them what you’ve promised. We just got the Garcia’s restaurant in Chubbuck, so my point is made and I hope it’s taken in the spirit of just my opinion on the facts that I was there for,  not thinking I don’t know what I’m talking about -I do. Want progress? Elect progressive people to start with. Want to grow and generate income for the city and allow businesses to get a good start to open up with.

"The school lines for middle and high school were recently re-drawn and they are much more balanced than the past.  I have kids ages 10-15 so that is what I know best but I have dealt with elementary schools for 20 years at work.  

century- good academics, clubs, some sports, not super conveniently located

Highland- football, Ok academics, my kids find it snobby

Poky- technical/trade classes.  outdoor sports fields are limited.  Kids are accepting

&#x200B;

middle schools- not a huge difference honestly.

Elem- 

I'm not impressed with Washington or Tyhee. I don't know if it is administration, funding or populations but the teachers just seem tired.  Top choices- Ellis, Gate City.  But really none are horrible.  My kids are at greenacres.  It is fine.

You will find housing costs have risen a lot the last few years but not as bad as Boise.  Decent family sized houses start at 250.  At 350 you are getting a newer build in a decent neighborhood  with 4 bedrooms.  At 450 you are getting 4000 sq ft in a nice neighborhood.  We actually just bought a 4200 sq ft house with a nice garage, detached shop and big shop for 420ish in a vary popular neighborhood.  This coming summer we will list a 4/3 2007 build by the hospital for 350-370.  We will also be listing a 1950s build 4/2 at the end of the year for 260ish.

Things that make it tougher:  If you want land (more than 1/2 acre), if you need a 3+ car garage, if you NEED a certain neighborhood, if you can't look past ugly paint.

"As far as I'm concerned, ""average home price"" is completely meaningless.  That doesn't take into account types of home, etc.  Are we talking single-wides, multi-family dwellings, single family homes, McMansions??

A more accurate comparison would be to look at cost per square foot of comparable property types.  For example, national average cost of a single-family home is $114 /sf, but the average cost for a Pocatello home right now is more like $138 /sf.  That still doesn't give you the whole picture, but it's a lot more representative than comparing something as broad average home price.

Consider also that the average household income is over $61,000 nationally, but average household income in Pocatello is more like $45,000.

The Pocatello area is absolutely overvalued right now.  We are not seeing even remotely sustainable home values at the moment.  They will inevitably drop.

There's like a parking lot with a nature sign off the road, it's like, 500 feet before that. There's like a little gravel road that goes back just out of sight of the road to a nice swimming spot. It even has a rope swing. The water is pretty deep, and the current is slow, but if you can't swim I don't recommend it because it is too deep for even someone very tall to touch the bottom.

"I will try to answer these the best I can, but I will warn you that most if it is my opinion based on things I have experienced/had friends experience.

With the masks, things are pretty lax. In smaller stores/c-stores, most people don't care, but the bigger stores are still quite stingy. No one will likely say anything, but you might get some nasty looks. I'd say just have a mask with you just in case.

Five star is, as far as I know, still terrible. I refuse to do any business with them alongside almost everyone I know in town. 

So I actually just recently met the owner of the Pocatello heights apartments. He is a somewhat nice person, but he is charging waaaaay to much for those places. They started out as Government-owned housing for low income families, but he has since turned them into pretentious holes for people that have more money than sense. 

Breweries are becoming more popular for sure. Jim Dandy is one I haven't personally been to, but people I know always seem to have a good time there. Wanderlust is my favorite by far. The new owners are some of the best people that I have met, and I cannot compliment them enough. They have rotating IPA taps and wine selections. Plenty of others are popping up around town. 

Any outdoor activities are very abundant around here. The hiking scene is growing, and trails are beginning to open up for the summer. While I have no problems with hiking/mountain biking, I lean more towards dirt biking. These trails are shared by everyone, and it can be somewhat dangerous on the trails that are obviously motorcycle-friendly. My dad got hurt on his dirt bike last year because of a mountain biker that did not move out of the way. Although dirt bikes are supposed to yield to everyone, which we respect, it is difficult to know when someone is going to be around a corner. My piece if advice for this is keep an ear out for dirt bikes/4 wheelers and realize it is much easier to take two steps off the trail than it is for riders to move a machine. There are, however, plenty of trails that are closed to motorized vehicles that have just as much scenery as anything. I recommend checking out upper/lower city creek. They are right on the edge of town, and take you to views that are quite beautiful. Another good one is west fork mink creek. It is deeper in the mountains, about a 30 minute drive south of town, and it is hiking/mountain biking only. Anything else, such as valve house, garden creek, corral creek, scout mountain, elk meadows, or trail creek are all motorized trails. They are the places you'll want to keep more of a keen ear on.

"Hey there! I've lived in Poky all of my life, but I haven't had too much Boise experience to compare it to. I can tell you that last year the trails started to get pretty busy compared to before the pandemic. They are still pretty active now, and probably will be for the rest of the year. Now that the bars are opening back up, it will probably lessen the crowd on the trails a bit.

It only takes 10-15 minutes to get to a trail if you live on the edges of town, and even on the edges they have a lot of outdoor activity areas. You could spend weeks trying to find all of the outdoor stuff to do around here. If you ran into a crowded trail, you could just drive around and more than likely find a low key trail for the day. 

I hope this helps!",t2_9apjk,Waynker87,0,1620510774.0,0,t1_gxfjlvx,gxfjlvx,True,Soundvibrations,t3_n7yz9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pocatello/comments/n7yz9s/boise_vs_pocatello/,Boise vs Pocatello,/r/Pocatello/comments/n7yz9s/boise_vs_pocatello/gxfjlvx/,9,r/Pocatello,0,9

/u/Doctor_24601 this is the right advice. My degrees are in the humanities, and they taught me how to think critically, how to read and process dense information, and middle class/professional norms that I didn’t get from my low-income upbringing. People shit on general education requirements, but they help you become well-rounded and flexible to accomplish a variety of kinds of tasks as they come up, rather than only being good at one kind of thing.

"As frustrated as I am with the district administration this is a really important vote!

Idaho as of 2018 was the state that spent the least amount on education per student, spending nearly half what most of our neighbor states are which leads to lower paying jobs.  You pay peanuts you get monkey's (I believe we are up now to 47th but the numbers are not out yet).  [https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics#idaho](https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics#idaho)

The levy is a ""mostly"" static price that has been going down in cost as more home get built.  Here is the districts 2 page document about it: [https://www.sd25.us/docs/district/spotlight/supplementalevy/pcsd25%20supplemental%20levy\_fnl\_02022021.pdf?id=8119](https://www.sd25.us/docs/district/spotlight/supplementalevy/pcsd25%20supplemental%20levy_fnl_02022021.pdf?id=8119)

""We just voted on a levy twice in the last two years!"" yup, there are 2 of them a 10 year and a 2 year levy.  2 years ago it was the supplemental, last year was the renewal of the 10 year one and this year is the supplemental again.  the supplemental goes more towards running the day to day of the district, extra staffing needs, extra teacher pay, extra-curricular student programs ext.

Levies were originally were intended to be short term affairs' to cover costs above and beyond the ""norm"" like building a new school or cover damage from some sort of extreme event.  However as we criminally underfund education in Idaho hundreds of districts around the state are now relying on their levies to cover basic operational costs like ours does.

"This town started out as a railroad town with a majority Mormon population. There's also a strong agricultural/trade background, which means a lot of poor whites and a lot of alcoholism, drug addiction (meth and heroin mostly) and domestic violence that lies just under the surface of what seems like a sleepy, religious town. To be honest, most of that won't really affect your day-to-day if you're going to school and minding your business, but you will inevitably have to deal with your fair share of characters that you wish you hadn't if you want to go anywhere or do anything. 

On the topic of things to do...don't really count on having a lot to choose from. If you like beer, we have had an influx of microbreweries take off in the last couple years and Jim Dandy has been winning awards after only 2 1/2 years of operation, but PVB is trash and Off the Rails and Star Route are still trying to figure out what they're doing--time will tell if they're serious. There's a handful of good restaurants, but if you want anything a bit nicer your only choices are The Yellowstone and The Sandpiper. 

Really, the only great thing about this town is the outdoor recreation. Pocatello/SE Idaho really is one of the most unique areas with tons of quick access to great hiking/mountain biking trails, fishing, hunting, skiing and pretty much anything you can think of to do outside.

"Hey, I'm also a grad student at ISU. I'm in the OT program. I am enjoying my experience here. I was accepted off the waitlist and it was difficult to find housing more last minute in the summer.   


I live at Hawthorne Garden Apartments and really enjoy it here. It is a pretty quiet community which has been great for online school/studying.  The apartments are spacious with lots of storage, tall ceilings, laminate flooring common areas/bathrooms, pool, small fitness center (open 24hrs), and a lot of parking. Management are great and any maintenance requests have been taken care of quickly. It's a quick drive to get to anywhere around town as it is close to both the freeway, and some highways. Regardless it is anywhere from a 5-10min commute to/from school.

Pocatello is what you make it.  Shopping at commerce are limited because it's located sandwiched so close to Boise and Idaho Falls so there is a ton of retail leakage.  For outdoorsy stuff, though, it can't be matched.  You are pretty much no more than 15-30 minutes away from any kind of outdoor activity.

Politically, it's really polarized with a lot of old, excessively conservative people that hold all of the money like Ebenezer Scrooge and they are always at war with the younger, progressive crowd that blames them for all of the towns problems.

"Hello! Depends on where you're moving from, but after living near Seattle and Toledo I found rent and overall cost of living to be extremely cheap and manageable. However, some cons to this college town are that many rental places are tiny, outdated, and overall rundown imo. I feel that most areas and town are safe, but you certainly get what you pay for rent wise. 

I would search Idaho DOL for job listing. I think opinion would vary based off of interest and career background, but as far as small rural towns go I feel there is good job availability. Perhaps just not as wide of a selection as I am used to coming from a bigger city. 

Also, I just wanted to add as a current grad student of ISU, I love the university, professors, and campus. Classes can be challenging over Zoom but I have still had a great and positive experience so far.

"That would be unfortunate.  The guy I dealt with (thought he was maybe the owner?) seemed like a really nice guy.  For the sake of giving him the benefit of the doubt, I'll reserve judgement until I see it myself, though.

This may not be the popular opinion with the PC crowd, and I absolutely don't condone racism, but at the same time I can acknowledge that I have opinions some may not agree with, and I know many people that also have opinions I don't agree with.  I find several beliefs of the LDS church to be as reprehensible as racism, but that doesn't mean I need to exclude them from my life or not support them as fellow members of my community.

In general I'd much rather patronize a small local business with an owner who has a few outdated views I don't understand or agree with, than to spend money at some morally bankrupt conglomerate like Wal-Mart.",t2_13j74j,TurboMP,0,1609142172.0,0,t1_gh9s04g,gh9s04g,False,Mormonejosonpendejo,t3_jkh62d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pocatello/comments/jkh62d/constructionroofing/,Construction/Roofing,/r/Pocatello/comments/jkh62d/constructionroofing/gh9s04g/,1,r/Pocatello,0,1

We own rentals and my GF is a realtor.  We often place tenants moving in to town in a rental and let them settle and start shopping for a house.

"I could have written your comment myself.  To add to it (this will get long):

**City Creek** is a fantastic trail system.  This is definitely not the best time of year to go, where we're in the awkward muddy season where it's too cold and wet for the trail to be dry, but too warm for the ground to freeze.

We took some out-of-town family to the **Museum of Clean**.  It's definitely quirky and we honestly went more for shits and giggles, but we all ended up really enjoying ourselves.  It's a great one to take kids as well.   The Potato Museum in Blackfoot (about 25 min North of town) also falls into the same category of quirky yet oddly enjoyable.

A fantastic 10 minute walk on campus is up to the top of **Red Hill**.  You will be hard pressed to find a better place in town to catch a good sunset.  Absolutely breathtaking.  Park [here](https://goo.gl/maps/PYpmZi9TBRHjDe8H7) then follow the little gravel road through the small gate, then take the dirt trail that heads north up the E side of the hill.  You're shooting for the columns up on top.

Also, check out the **Ross Park** area, specifically the [Shade Side Trail](https://goo.gl/maps/QisivmNLgLaEBWb79).  One of the most unique things about Pocatello is a lava flow that runs through town, and you can really get a good taste of it there.  It's a neat place.  You can also wrap around and go check out [the area by the zoo](https://g.page/zooidaho?share), which is on the opposite side of the lava flow.

I'd say one of the biggest assets in the area is the **trail network**, both urban and in the mountains.  Bannock County is 1,100 square miles and much of it is mountainous area filled with countless recreation opportunities.  Take a look at the ""Pocatello Trails"" Facebook group for a very active bunch of trail users, from hikers, mountain bikers, equestrians, and motorized trail users.  Good bunch of people and they'd be happy to address any questions specific to local trail use.

If you want to go for a pretty 1ish hour drive, I like to go [up Buckskin, around into Inkom, and up to Pebble Creek Ski Area](https://goo.gl/maps/Gzi2U968Anchr3H4A).  The view up there is great and the sunsets are awesome.  On your way back down into town stop in and grab a drink and a treat at [The Place](https://goo.gl/maps/bva4qoJXAkqrFVoQ6), in Inkom.

I also like to just park downtown and wander around the **Main Street** area in ""Historic Downtown"" (we all just call it ""old town"").  There are a couple big parking lots that you can use, then just get out and explore on foot.  There are a few places to eat ([Villanos Italian](https://goo.gl/maps/dKVbrwoCCVthCtc76) is really good) and a bunch of little bars and stuff down in that area, including a [whiskey bar](https://g.page/pocatellosonlywhiskeybar?share) that shares a building with another bar and a higher end restaurant.  Main Street is kinda cool at night because there's a group who has been restoring a bunch of the old neon signs, so there are a few cool things to see at night.  It's not a very vibrant downtown area, but it's really been improving.  While you're down there, pop into [Station Square](https://g.page/stationsquarepocatello?share).  It's a really cool old building that's been restored very well inside.  There's a Hawaiian food joint and a place that serves drinks, among other things.  On your way to downtown, be sure to come down Clark/Center St so you go through the underpass that goes under the tracks.  Nothing exciting, but it's a landmark in town.  On that note, pay a LOT of attention to one way streets.  There are some confusing areas in town with a healthy network of one way streets.  I can't go a week without seeing an out-of-towner turning the wrong way onto a one way street.

If I were you, I'd look up the **[Portneuf Greenway Trails](http://portneufgreenway.org/trails/)**, make a list of them, and just start trying them all out.  I grew up in Pocatello yet nothing has opened my eyes to the beauty of this small town more than getting out and exploring on foot.  The Greenway Trails are truly fantastic.  You can walk, jog, bike, etc.  For one of the trails I've enjoyed the most lately, which is right by Red Hill (mentioned above), you can park [here](https://goo.gl/maps/GU2XTzrn4pgUz5Lc6) then take the paved trail that runs north along the east fence of the Humane Society.  It will tie into the campus sidewalk system [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rsi13zqMAwUPSLf46) so you can actually tie into it from the NW end as well, it's just that parking is less easy to explain.

I could go on and on.  It's not the most exciting little town, but there really is a lot of cool stuff to see if you put in a little effort and, most importantly, just get out and explore on foot.  So long as you don't go banging on doors at night in a trailer park, there really isn't a part of town I wouldn't feel comfortable exploring on foot alone, even at night.  Compared to any of the bigger cities I've lived in, it's a relatively safe place and people tend to look out for each other pretty well.

Good luck!

Edit:  I almost forgot... the **[Portneuf Wellness Complex](https://goo.gl/maps/gzcywdFP7oxogkyg9)** is absolutely worth checking out.

"CC Exteriors put a new roof on my house pretty recently and I was very happy with them.  They did a great job.

I  will say that the cleanliness left a little to be desired, specifically  with the roofing nails leftover in my lawn, but it wasn't a big deal to  me.  Just go down to Harbor Freight and pick up one of their $12  magnetic floor sweepers.  It was a total lifesaver and I'd honestly do  that with *any* roofing company  because no one will care about your stuff as much as you, and having a  neighborhood kid step on a nail in my lawn was a big concern.

Personally,  given how smoothly the rest of the process went and how much less  expensive they were than some of their competition, spending an hour  combing my lawn with a magnetic rake was a petty tradeoff and I'd  totally do it all over again.  Cody (the owner) was awesome to work  with.

As a notable mention...  Andrew (I think?) with Big Bear Roofing came out and gave us a quote and  he seemed like a great guy.  I don't know what the rest of his crew is  like, but I wouldn't hesitate to give them a shot either, I just can't  speak to any personal experience with them other than having him out for  a quote.

GP Roofing has done a  bunch of my neighbors' houses and while they seem to run a little more  professional, cleaner setup, their crews have been some of the more  obnoxious roofers we've had in the neighborhood (some were even cat  calling my wife when she was out in the yard one day) and they seem to  take a lot longer than any of the other companies in our neighborhood.   Where CC Exteriors took a couple days to do my roof from setup to break down,  my neighbor's roof that is very similar size and pitch and GP Roofing  had equipment (a dumpster and porta potty, if I recall correctly) in our  neighborhood for a few weeks.  I've been so unimpressed with GP  Roofing working on several neighbor houses that we didn't even consider  them for a quote, even though on the surface they may appear to be a  step up in quality from some of the others.",t2_13j74j,TurboMP,0,1604027603.0,0,t1_gakdaws,gakdaws,True,Mormonejosonpendejo,t3_jkh62d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pocatello/comments/jkh62d/constructionroofing/,Construction/Roofing,/r/Pocatello/comments/jkh62d/constructionroofing/gakdaws/,2,r/Pocatello,0,2

"I can't say I've had any bad experiences with Sparklight.  I had Comcast for 10 years before moving to Pocatello, and the service has been comparable.  (I actually worked for Comcast in college.)  I don't recall what tier I'm paying for, but full price I pay around $60 /mo and I just did a speed test that came in at 140 mbps down and 21 mbps up (with a 9 ms ping).

I'm a web developer and spend a good chunk of my days transferring files to and from the web (while usually simultaneously streaming HD YouTube videos), and I spend a couple evenings a week gaming at 4K on the xbox.  No issues at all.  Never had a single issue gaming, and my internet for work and browsing is blazing fast.  We have 3 people in the house that are almost constantly using the internet at some point or another during the day, often for streaming.

My parents have had Sparklight / Cable One for 20+ years with no issues.

I've never personally had any luck with CenturyLink.  They have often been the ISP at past jobs I've had and they've always been relatively unreliable compared to their competition.

I can't speak to TV service as the extend of the shows I watch are based on YouTube.  Not a sports guy, but I know a few people that like Sling TV for that kind of thing.
