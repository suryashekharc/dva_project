"I live near this intersection and frequently ride this road. To be honest, there are no good options. I do use the wide sidewalk on the north side of College, east of Woodland, particularly because that's the only way to jump onto the Gary Haller Trail. However, on my way back home, that wide sidewalk ends at Woodland, and then I either get to ride the narrow (and very broken/overgrown) sidewalk or jump over to the road. There are sections of that sidewalk that have been missing for a couple years, and some steel cables laying across them. When traffic is light I think it's perfectly reasonable to just ride College and expect drivers to change lanes. I avoid riding College when traffic is heavy, but understand I would be entitled to do so if I wanted....it's just not worth the risk for me.

I ride the Haller trail because I don't want to get run over by inattentive drivers (or road rage a-holes), but that trail is full of dogs, kids, and runners, which makes it challenging to ride at more than a walking pace on a nice weekend day.

The roads that do have bike lanes are also stressful because the bike lanes end frequently where there are turn lanes, which means you have cars and bikes swapping lanes. That's a great place to get clipped.

Like someone else mentioned, there's no good way to get from this area down to Garmin without going through a couple roads and intersections that I would rather not face in morning traffic.

"My top preference has always been for D'Bronx at 103rd & Metcalf.  I also like Buffalo State in downtown OP (they have a killer Wed night meal deal with pizza + salad + bread sticks for $28).

Around where that Pizza Shoppe was at 127th & Pflumm, my preference was Minsky's over Pizza Shoppe, and if I don't feel like driving, that Minsky's at College & Pflumm is super consistent and fast, so easy to do any time.  I think Minsky's also has a Thursday night eat-in special on pizza that we did a couple of times.  

I tried carry-out from Stonewall at 103rd & Pflumm a couple of times, but seems like their pizza doesn't travel well, and I don't get pizza in person much - although I do like their pizza.  Another option I don't go to very often is Pizza Man right by Stonewall at 103rd & Pflumm - good if you like Chicago very think crust and/or Chicago beef steak sandwiches.

Barley's Brewhaus at 119th & Quivira (I haven't been there in a while) was doing a pretty good deep-dish Chicago-style pizza.  It's a little expensive but pretty good. I don't know that any place around JoCo has a very good Chicago deep dish pizza.  There was something around 79th & Quivira, if I remember correctly, but not sure if they're still open.

Papa Keno's is now open over by 147th & Metcalf - good if you liked the original downtown OP (now Buffalo State) Papa Keno's.  (Buffalo State pizza is almost identical to Papa Keno's since Buffalo store was just a split off from the original Papa Keno's owners).",t2_5otyw,cyberphlash,0,1645117243.0,0,t1_hxbuqhs,hxbuqhs,False,ryanmetcalf,t3_suq7ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Olathe/comments/suq7ac/noooooooo_decadesold_johnson_county_pizza_place/,‚ÄòNoooooooo!!!!!‚Äô Decades-old Johnson County pizza place closes after losing its lease,/r/Olathe/comments/suq7ac/noooooooo_decadesold_johnson_county_pizza_place/hxbuqhs/,2,r/Olathe,0,2

"I think the easy answer is that some people choose to live closer to Lawrence and work in JoCo or (relatively near) parts of the KC metro for the same reason you'd prefer to live in Manhattan again.  Would you be happier in Desoto or Eudora where you could more easily go do stuff in Lawerence again?  Or just live in eastern Lawrence? Or close to downtown KC?

I moved to JoCO 20 years ago and was kind of in your situation.  My wife and I just started going out a lot and doing more nature-focused activities (JoCo's got a lot of great parks/trails).  But as singles, as you point out, there's not much nightlife in the suburbs, so if that's a big component of your life, maybe the suburbs aren't for you.

If you're younger and planning on having kids, you might find that as you have kids, you transition from this focus on nightlife or singles activities into more mommy-group activities with other people who have kids, or to event-based activities as you start toting your kids around to every soccer field in the county nights and weekends.

"I'd say COVID had a lot to do with it. The disconnect, inability to engage others, etc. There is the distrust of the stranger magnified now.

For all those things you seek in terms of entertainment you have to go into the metro. Plaza, Westport, Crossroads, 18th and Vine, Downtown KC, MO, etc.

We are suburbia. Our downtown is a few stores, I think there is a watering hole, I've never been to. And, the only live music nearby that I know off was at Llywelyns which is not in Olathe.  Pre- COVID, people went to karaoke bars, etc.

Personally, I like the peace and quiet. I walk or ride my bike to the parks. Blackbob Park is cool, but COVID.

"There's a practice right across from Burns and McDonnell on the east side of Ward Parkway (or there was around 2009) and I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy.

It was a big deal to me, I didn't enjoy living on yogurt and mashed potatoes for a month!!

">The Johnson County Planning Commission‚Äôs anti-solar vote demonstrates the dangerous strength of anti-renewable local politicians, including Kansas state Sen. Mike Thompson, Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O‚ÄôHara, Planning Commissioner Kelley Rast (appointed by O‚ÄôHara), and Conservative Republicans of Southern Johnson County Chair Greg Cromer. These closely-linked politicians strongly oppose renewable energy for purely ideological reasons, and they promote continued operation of 50-year-old coal-fired plants at Lawrence and La Cygne, Kansas ‚Äî plants their owner, Evergy, would like to shut down. Thompson and his allies appear to be aiming to prevent solar farm construction not only in Johnson County but throughout Kansas.

>The anti-renewable politicians have addressed the Johnson County Planning Commission and residents with extreme misinformation and distortions about solar, while acknowledging no environmental impacts from coal-fired plants. They have convinced many people that solar farms would seriously impact them and the environment though an outrageous misinformation campaign. The planning commission‚Äôs independent consultant, who drafted the solar zoning regulations, debunked several key claims by solar opponents. He concluded that after mitigation measures are enacted, such as visual screening, neighbors won‚Äôt know a solar farm is nearby.

"Op, I don‚Äôt know you, but I‚Äôm a teacher. I support your son having a suspension. It could give him time to prepare to petition the vandalism off of his record.

He can write apology letters to the admin, provide reimbursement for the damaged property, and explain why it is critical for the charge to come off (accident can‚Äôt be vandalism, remorse, planning for future).

"Most DnD 3.5/PF 1e on roll20 now is done by paid Gm's I refuse to pay. 

Some even asking upward of 100 dolor's a session.

The other half on roll20 want to play some hybrid of dnd 3.5/PF 1e mixed with 5e and not taken the time to properly do so and hence some unplayable for most. 

I am not a good enough type/speller/grammar for text based games.

I have tried some west marches for dnd 3.5 and pf 1e those are hit and miss tbh.

I have also tried online discord communities to find local games. Such as Pathfinder 1e discord server the main one not 3pp.

But due to covid even with shots many are very weary to play f2f on those even if you live close.

I have no problem wearing a mask if local group wishes me too. 

And if  group wishes we can play in public spots I have already checked with restaurants  before few years back before covid (Example when 31rst century was closing down) to play there at that time with that group.

Restaurants don't care as long as you keep noise down, order food and drink and tip good.

(Btw reason I am not in that group anymore is group  disbanded on a disagreement with the GM at the time)

"We are conducting this study to better understand how adolescents set goals for physical activity and understanding mood, environment, and other factors throughout the day. This will entail your teen doing a few main tasks, for approximately 30 days total study participation:  
  
Attending three lab visits\*\* with your teen at our lab at the University of Kansas (or virtually ‚Äì see below). One lab visit will occur at the start of the study, one approximately 7 days after that, and another one in 20 days for approximately 30 days of your teen‚Äôs participation total. We will first get your consent and your teen‚Äôs assent to participate if they are eligible. At the first lab visit, which should last about an hour, we will give them a device to wear on their wrist that will measure their physical activity as well as a GPS tracker to wear on their belt. They will wear these devices for the entire study. After the first 7 days of the study, your teen will complete the second lab visit, which is only 20 minutes long, where your teen will be oriented to the TAGS text messages and surveys.  
  
For the next 20 days following the second lab visit, your teen will receive surveys everyday which will ask them questions about their day and their exercise. Each survey will take approximately 2-5 minutes to complete. They will also receive text messages to set exercise goals daily.  
  
After 20 days of answering surveys and texts, you and your teen will complete the last lab visit, which should take no longer than an hour, to return the devices that we gave them and complete some surveys. Your teen can earn up to $50 on a gift card for completing the study. If they complete the study, the gift card will be given to them at the last lab visit.  
  
\*\*There is also an option to do virtual lab visits over Zoom upon request or due to COVID-19. If you choose this option, you and your teen will complete a consent and assent process over the phone or Zoom. If you both agree to participate, we will mail you study devices and will conduct all lab visits over Zoom. You and your teen will complete the same tasks at the lab visits and during the 30-day study. After the third lab visit, you will mail us back the study devices in prepaid packages to our office\*\*",t2_3uwv9aw6,PediatricHealthLab,0,1635385188.0,0,t1_hibs26j,hibs26j,False,PediatricHealthLab,t3_qgzlui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Olathe/comments/qgzlui/research_opportunity_for_teenagers_in_olathe/,Research Opportunity for Teenagers in Olathe,/r/Olathe/comments/qgzlui/research_opportunity_for_teenagers_in_olathe/hibs26j/,1,r/Olathe,0,1

You are anti semitic, classism, and  have racial undertones in your responses.  It is sad and disturbing that you and several high ranking officials who claim to be of the left side of politics have this in common.

"Back to the ad hominem attacks you go. 

I summarized as bite sized facts that you can put into education agendas for the 1776 PAC is what you're wanting. Good or bad you don't want to deny it, correct?

> every American has control over their own destiny

Your belief is not a fact. Your belief, this story you've told yourself, is not and should not be taught as facts in school. It should not be taught as part of any education agenda which seems to be part of your goal. My point is that there is more to society, life, and the choices afforded people and not everyone has the same opportunities to forge ahead in life contra to your view. 

You clearly are not versed in CRT. You are unwillingly to actually engage with the arguments and ideas that it actually makes outside of the Straw Men arguments pushed by misinformation campaigns.

I hope this encounter spurs you to adventure beyond the ghetto of information you are living in. Broaden your understanding of others thoughts and ideas and engage in a more civilized and thoughtful manner. Hold a mirror up and challenge your own beliefs.

Clearly you didn't read the articles or digest them and are still caught up in some non-existent narrative about what CRT is, buying into the misinformation.

Your ""cancel culture"" narrative though seems to be tied up with statues coming down and buildings renamed. If you're referring to all the post-civil war lost cause monuments - good riddance. We should not be glorify traitors to the United States of America. The names of the traitors can and should be taught in school for the awful things they stood for and did. We do not build statues to the bad ideas and glorify those who fought for them. Instead we learn about them in history, discuss the effects, and learn not to repeat them, but we do not honor them.

When indeed CRT is integrated into the education system nation wide. Again I will say it is not adopted or formally taught in the Olathe Schools but is taught informally by some teachers in the Olathe Schools. 
 
There is also a direct relationship between CRT and the cancel culture, whether you want to believe it or not.  Look at all the historical statues being removed, buildings being renamed, etc.

I'm glad you have me figured out but I only asked you once and you never answered instead pivoting to the product of the ""dumbing of America"" comment.

&#x200B;

>If I need to state why I believe CRT is bad for the United States I can some it up ""cancel coulture"". \[sic\] The erasing of history whether it is bad or good is not correct.

So Critical Race Theory is, according to you, cancel culture which is about erasing history and the things that CRT wants to erase are the following:

* Slavery occurred in this country thats a fact, some of the founding fathers of this country were slave owners thats a fact.
* These same founding fathers are who enacted the articles of independence to give us the freedom we have today thats a fact.
* The Star Spangle Banner is about an event that describes a battle that was waged for separation from the United Kingdom.

I don't think I fully follow but are you saying that CRT denies that slavery occurred like WWII Holocaust deniers, I'd definitely be on board if this is what is going on? Maybe you're saying that somehow these facts are being twisted in someway that you don't agree with but you would need to elaborate as I have a hard time believing that there are educators out there denying slavery existed.

* Economic equality is not part of a Republic, the opportunity is though.

This last point is suspect. I don't think an economic theory was ever established within the Constitution. I am quite intrigued that you think that opportunity is though. Do you think that everyone is entitled to the same opportunities for advancement? Is the playing field level for everyone? How does your view on economics fit into your view of opportunity because I would argue that those with more resources have access to more opportunities than those without. How does your view of opportunity fit within the facts that throughout US history certain be have been disenfranchised from exercising those opportunities such as home loan red-lines after WWII.

 I don't know much about the pedagogy of CRT but according to these three professors who pioneered CRT it is a reaction to critical legal studies - law.

"I lived and raised 3 kids in Olathe, for about 16 yrs. It's a great community and I highly recommend it.  Their school district is one of the best in the nation and very active with listening & involving parents. The schools are always kept up, the teachers are the best and they have a very open door policy. My kids all graduated there. I lived right West of the old downtown area, in PERSIMMON HILLS homeowners assn area. Very good association, Nice homes, well made and they have two pools and are just across the highway from the Olathe lake, we used to ride our bikes out there and fish. If you want a newer area, then go EAST of I-35 and that is where most of the action is, but more crowded. We liked where we lived very much, built our home out there and it had a country feel, but you are 30 minutes of less to all the beautiful suburbs, like Shawnee (where I live now), Overland Park, Lenexa, Merriam. Kansas city is very close but we liked being where we lived, very good people live there & keep their homes in tip top shape. All kinds of homes but the sell very fast. East of I-35 are older and newer homes and you would have much more to choose from. Olathe has grown a LOT since we moved into Olathe, in 1982. You will have to drive slightly farther to get into the city but you may have heard, Kansas City is the livable city, because its just to right size to see so many things, KC has it all.  Olathe has some of the best walking trails, biking trails I've seen and we loved that. There is so much to do, you won't be sorry you chose Olathe. Many people live at some of the other towns too since they all go together. You would love Shawnee, but the homes there go like instantly. If you have kids, Olathe has every sports opportunity you could imagine. At first we were concerned Olathe was too far out, but that was 1982. Olathe has grown so much it practically is in all the other suburbs now. They have put in more bridges & roads that you can take many other ways to get into the city faster, if you want. The malls are close, great food and we always thought that it was like a mini vacation, when we left Olathe and discovered all the other little towns that have wonderful adventures also.

"I've lived in Olathe since 1999.  I watched it grow up from a medium-sized town to now a pretty large city (now the fourth-largest city in the state).  I live on the west side of I-35 which has a reputation as being the ""bad"" part of Olathe by people who don't know any better.  Mostly because there's a trailer park about a mile from my house.  That trailer park never bothered me in the slightest, but it's something we get made fun of for here.

So does Olathe have a strong sense of community?  Eh, I dunno.  I've never felt like it does.  It's a bedroom community.  People that live here work somewhere else.  It's not what I'd call a ""walkable"" city.  Though it's reasonably bikeable if you stay off the main roads, and there is the Mill Creek Trail I bike on regularly too, which you can ride all the way to the river.  And also the Indian Creek Trail that you can ride all the way into Overland Park and beyond.  But I'm getting off topic.

Does it value diversity?  I mean, kind of.  There's a decent sized Mexican community here and a couple of pretty legit places to get Mexican food.  But are those people valued by richer white folks?  Not really.  I wouldn't call racism a scourge around here but there is definitely some class division that falls along racial lines.  I've seen more than a few middle class white folks disapprove of hearing someone in earshot speaking Spanish.

What neighborhoods are walkable?  The ones west of I-35 and south of Santa Fe, in other words the ""old"" part of Olathe.  There are some very nicer and some very run down parts of town between there and 151st street.  The area nearest to downtown has some quite nice older houses, and the people that live there seem to mostly care for their upkeep.  Those streets are often quieter with less traffic, and more bikeable (a plus for me).

Outdoor recreation?  Well, there are some parks.  Some of them are nice I suppose.  A couple of public pools.  Nothing to write home about.

What do I like most about living here?  Well, in my case I paid off my house years ago and have been plotting my exit for some time now.  The person I was in 1999 when I bought my house and who I am in 2021 are nowhere near the same person with the same needs and same interests.  I have made this place my home for half my life and have had many good times here.  But my heart lies elsewhere and I see myself moving into the city sometime in the next couple of years.  If you want to raise a family, Olathe is a nice enough place.

There's definitely a divide between Johnson County and ""the rest of the metro"".  JoCo is (not incorrectly) seen as insular, rich, and not particularly culturally diverse.",t2_3601e,Philo_T_Farnsworth,0,1623177989.0,0,t1_h126szq,h126szq,True,patypajarito,t3_nuqbso,https://www.reddit.com/r/Olathe/comments/nuqbso/considering_a_move_to_olathe/,Considering a move to Olathe,/r/Olathe/comments/nuqbso/considering_a_move_to_olathe/h126szq/,5,r/Olathe,0,5

"I grew up and lived at the 151st and I35 area up until about 5 years ago.

"There is generally a sense of pride living in Olathe. The city seems to do a good job giving opportunities to be engaged through festivals, concerts, fourth fridays, Christmas light shows etc. 

I‚Äôm afraid to say it is probably a pretty typical Johnson County Suburb, though. 

I don‚Äôt know that I can say they *value* diversity but there is some diversity. In particular a strong latino presence with multiple Spanish speaking churches, taco shops, and carnecerias

For strong sense of community identity Central Core is a good bet. No cookie cutter homes, and they continue to revitalize the area. Also a group that seems proud to live there. 

I assume by walkability you mean walking to run errands?  I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find any part of the city particularly walkable in that way. Central core you can walk to a coffee shop, bakery, a restaurant, a few boutique shops but no market, for example. It is a walkable suburb in terms of having sidewalks. For fitness there are also lots of trails to ride, walk, or run on. 

I may get completely skewered for this here, but have you considered Lawrence?  I like Olathe, it is safe, the city operates responsibly, and the schools are good but I love Lawrence.
