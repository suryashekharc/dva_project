"The WNC library is far superior for studying in than the Carson City library, in my opinion. The CC library isn't really set up well for independent studying as the room is really just a bunch of computers want it can be hard to buy focus on what others are doing. Not to mention, some of thev dude who go there totally look like the type who would browse porn on public computers. The WNC library has open stress, study rooms, and study pods that you can effectively block out other people with. The only thing is that the students don't follow library protocol (because it's not enforced), so there are times that you can totally overhead conversations or the group study rooms can get a little loud. If I'm there studying for a test vs my house, I'll take my headphones and have instrumental music playing in the background; even still, I've had to be that person before and go to the staff to have them ask people to keep it down.

Yes. Carson City is a bowl. The smoke comes in and sits here. When Paradise burned, it looked like a scene from Silent Hill. I had ash coming in through the windows.

That depends on what you're allergic to.

>Are the internet providers good quality?

I use Charter. It's not bad.

Summers can get very hot. 90s+. Winters are equally brutal - last week our highs were in the 40s. Nights are always cold no matter the season.

Snow is nasty. It hits and turns to ice.

The education system sucks.

The restaurant choices are redundant and lackluster.

We don't have state lotto here, but you will find slot machines in gas stations and laundry mats.

Prostitution and marijuana are legal.

I know this is a year old but doing some research of my own and had a question about this if you don't mind. Do you have a private house rental or is it like a townhome/condo kind of thing?

We wouldn't mind either situation but would really like to have a 3 bdr with a garage and at least an enclosed patio.

"Depends on the student. I'm a parent with a kid that went to CHS and now in Pioneer and who's dealt with the administration in both schools far too often..So here's my input

CHS..more opportunity for different ""optional"" classes and sports. WAY TOO overcrowded, teachers not giving a shit because they aren't held accountable by admin. Gang issues. Forget lunch due to their inability to be organized. (my kid constantly wasted the entire lunch period just standing in line trying to get food). No real discipline against bullying. 

Pioneer...used to be for the problem kids and delinquents but a few years back they started working towards the kids who are also above average and bored with CHS classes.
Less in the way of extra curricular classes but what they have are better like the mountain climbing class. Small classes so students have more ""one on one"" time with teachers. 

My kid does better with Pioneer and her grades jumped because she was able to get help and answers from teachers and the communication between teachers and parents is far better. CHS is basically a cesspool these days where the teachers and admin admit their priority is to keep teachers safe and employed and if there's issues, it's the student's fault no matter what.

Also, CHS's online system is through google but the teachers didn't keep things up to date and oftentimes ""forgot"" to grade or mark assignments. One class was an F until we went in and demanded they look at the teacher's online marks, found the teacher was fucking off and her grade went from an F to a B due to all the assignments marked as not turned in, were found.


I've been working with the City Council for years to get the 2nd High School approved and built (it was supposed to be on the open land to the south of the Hospital on Carson St.) but the funds keep going elsewhere so you have CHS at literally DOUBLE the attendance than the school is designed for.

"I'll get downvoted again by the realtors or contractors that cruise this forum but as someone dealing with housing and real estate right now, I can give you the insights as I work with those realtors and contractors.

We have a market of greed going on as businesses, investment groups, realty agencies and individuals from CA and OR are coming in, buying up houses to fix up and flip and then sell to others coming in from markets that are way more than ours. I'm in a house now that just 3 months ago was valued at 300k, I bought it at 140k. Today i've had cash offers for 450-550k sight unseen and that keeps going up. It's retarded because this house is only really worth about 200-225k in a NORMAL MARKET.

Then you have the realtors around here who see dollar signs and are now specifically advertising to the CA market first and locally 2nd. I've had friends in the industry tell me they post upwards of a week to other friends and insiders before listing it locally. There's a reason why locals are being ""sniped"" by cash offers that are 100-150k OVER what is listed. 2 friends of mine trying to buy houses have even turned to offering cash over the list price and still losing bids because there's already ""agreements"" made under the table.

Sad part is, this is a service industry state. We are lower waged around here and most workers are not getting the raises people think they should. The average cost now for a 3 bdrm apartment is over 2k a month. 

A 3brm house for rent is around 2500 a month IF you can get into one. Almost all get rented the same day they get posted. (so be careful applying and paying for applications on anything that's been listed for more than a few days. Odds are it's already gone and the realtor or website is just collecting money and then telling people they can use that on other listings instead).

This market is going to crash hard and soon because you cannot push housing this far over the average resident's income for this long. It's not sustainable. It's really that simple. People buying houses now are going to be in for a shock in 1-2 years.",t2_gwtu8,Sumner67,0,1626724088.0,0,t1_h5sggbh,h5sggbh,True,[deleted],t3_obiw3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/carsoncity/comments/obiw3r/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/carsoncity/comments/obiw3r/deleted_by_user/h5sggbh/,1,r/carsoncity,0,1

"I had Sprint for 15 years with very few issues. Calls would only drop going through Moundhouse or a certain spot in Washoe Valley. When they got bought by T-Mobile that all changed, and my calls were dropping all the time as well as texts not going through. I kept asking if anything needed to be done since there was such a huge change, but I kept being told that Sprint customers didn't need to do anything after the switch. I moved to Verizon after a few months of spotty service, which was great ~ unless I wanted to make a call from my house. I'm in Indian Hills, and for some reason my call quality really sucked at home, and they would drop all the time, even when Verizon sent me a network extender.

I got tired of having to make phone calls from my driveway, so now we have AT&T. Call quality in Carson is much better, but my data strength at my work in Reno is horrible. Tbh, I work in a hospital that has horrible cell reception with every carrier, so you've gotta pick your battles...

My oldest son kept his line with Sprint/T-Mobile even with the new issues. All of that resolved when they sent him a new SIM card specifically for T-Mobile...

"It hasn't worked. Doesn't mean it won't. Workers have more power now than they have in decades. If now isn't the time to make demands of employers then never will be. Within a civilized society every individual deserves a life of dignity and health. 

Most capitalist societies put that burden on business owners and employers. That burden becomes cost in practical terms and the natural goal of all capitalists is to cut costs; so we arrive at a paradox. The burden of the societal contract is placed upon the people who want it the least and will shirk it any given opportunity. 

At the end of the day an employee is a cost to be cut. Businesses don't care about employees. They can't by their very nature. But they need the work to get done. 

The point I'm getting at is that if at any point an employee has an opportunity to apply leverage over their employer to gain more money or benefits or both, then they absolutely should.  And now is that time. 

Ask your boss for a raise. I bet you'll get it.

"Yeah. Medical imaging is really the best way to find out for sure. Unfortunately, the docs do X-rays first and then MRI or CT.

Reknown in Gardnerville wants $2500, CTH or Great Basin is between 300 and 800, and there‚Äôs a place in Reno that will do an mri for 300-500.  Of course you have to get a referral from a doctor.

"Do it. Moving there was one of the best decisions of my life. I‚Äôve since moved away and honestly I get homesick for it everyday.

As far as CC, there wasn‚Äôt much to do in the city. To me, nightlife was virtually nonexistent. However, it‚Äôs a short drive to Reno, where‚Äôs there‚Äôs much more of everything!

However, if you like the outdoors, it‚Äôs the place for you. The best part of living there was being so close to Tahoe. It was everything.

The weather was amazing. It only rained once the entire time I was there, but then we‚Äôd get these incredible snows that were so beautiful. The heat is brutal in the summer, but you can escape to Tahoe for the perfect weather. For the most part, it stayed the same day to day.

Make sure you have a car that can drive in the snow! You‚Äôll almost definitely have to get chains for your tires, but that‚Äôs no big deal. However, if your car is low to the ground, I can see that being a problem. The snows we‚Äôd get sometimes would cover a small car completely, and there‚Äôs no way you could drive in that. 

It is expensive to live there. I feel fortunate for the apartment I found, however it was around $800 a month, and it wasn‚Äôt in the nicest part of town and it wasn‚Äôt the nicest apartment. Fill up on gas in Carson, not Reno or Tahoe. Dayton sometimes had better gas prices than Carson!

So crime...like I said, I lived in a not so nice part of town. My car was broken into sitting right outside my apartment door, and I lost a lot. The guy was a total creep too and tried to contact me on Facebook to tell me he found my bag and wanted a reward. He was persistent, and it was scary knowing he knew where I lived. The cops were no help. There were other shady individuals around, so I was constantly on the lookout and on my guard being by myself out there. Looking back on it now, I think it made me more resilient, and I don‚Äôt mind it anymore. Just be smart and you‚Äôll be fine.

Be ready for your commute to really anywhere take about 20 minutes at least. CC itself is already kinda spread out, and Reno and Tahoe are still drives to get to them.

I can‚Äôt think of anything else right now, but I think you should just do it.

"It's sort of expensive, I hate to say. Gas trends higher here than the Midwest, but still cheaper than California. Carson City actually has great gas prices compared to Reno/Washoe County due to different tax schemes.   

Grocery Outlet is my favorite grocery store out here; it's like the TJM@xx of groceries. Awesome, high quality food at amazing prices. There are some staples they always have, and then surprise organic, healthy stuff all the time. Also home goods, pet supplies, clothes, gardening, holiday, etc depending on the day. 

The costs of registering (initially & annually) a car are shocking in NV. Due to no state income tax, they make up a bit for it on car registrations. And in some counties you have to pass smog to register. They make it super convenient by being able to register when/where you smog. But for a cheaper used car, it's probably not too bad. 

Good news-used cars out here are not rusty! The lack of humidity is the cure to rust, lol.  I have no idea about used car prices, but sales taxes definitely better in CC than Reno. And there are lots of used car lots. 

Even though Carson City is right next to the Sierra Nevada, they are in the ""rain shadow"" and enjoy really beautiful and mild weather. You get some crazy weather now & again, but it is typically pleasant with ~300 sunny days a year. There are actually some ""snow belts"" from Lake Tahoe as it is just on the other side of the hill from CC. Worthy destination, and it got way too crowded due to Covid. The snow melts pretty fast too being closer to the sun, but the snow sticks around a lot longer up in the hills, so you can always go to the snow.

"You will love it here; moved near CC, solo, almost 5 years ago and it is home to me like nowhere else. If you love outdoor recreation you will never be bored. Be prepared for your breath to be taken away any time you walk out the door or go anywhere, it's stunningly beautiful anywhere you go in NV.

Definitely will need your car; where I live, a town 40 miles away is considered ""down the road"", and ""in the neighborhood"". Things are VERY spread out here, and you will also want your car to explore this amazing part of the planet and beyond.  

It is EXPENSIVE to live anywhere in this area, many people I've met rent rooms for ~300-500/month. Rent for a 1-2 bedroom apartment can range anywhere from 800-1,500./month easily. There is a housing shortage here that just keeps getting worse. Buying a home is a competitive sport in these parts, and you sort of take what you can get (which is often an older manufactured home for ~$300k). This has to be the Capitol of people who live in 5th wheels and off grid too (like on BLM land), due to the limited housing options. 

As we open up, you will likely be able to easily find jobs in the casinos or restaurants.

"Just moved here and was in the same boat as you. Best advice: join the local facebook groups, check craigslist (but be careful for scams) and call every single phone number you can find. Also, lower your standards since you will have to jump at whatever chance you get for rentals. (If you are purchasing, your options are better but surprisingly expensive). Average of 75 people applying per property. Its a daily grind but even the locals are having a hard time finding/keeping housing so attitudes from landlords can vary greatly when you say you are from out of town. Best of luck to you. 

We found our place on craigslist. Everybody told us it was a scam...walmart even refused to let us wire money for a deposit since we had never actually met the landlord. I think craigslist is really just easier for some folks who are not so computer savvy and not on facebook which is common out here.
