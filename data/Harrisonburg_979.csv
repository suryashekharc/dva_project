"EASTON, Md. — A statue that was thought to be the last Confederate monument on a courthouse lawn in Maryland was removed Monday.  


The “Talbot Boys Statue” was removed first and workers then loaded the   
stone base onto a flatbed truck by crane as small crowd watched. Some   
passing motorists who asked what was happening, cheerfully replied,   
“finally!” when they heard the news.

“Hallelujah!” said Sheryl Goodspeed of Easton. “I was very happy.”

The statue that stood on the Talbot County courthouse lawn in Easton for  
 a century was thought to be the last Confederate monument still   
standing on public property in Maryland other than cemeteries and   
battlefields. The 13-foot (3.9-meter) tall, copper sculpture features a   
boy holding a Confederate flag and names the men from the Eastern Shore   
county who joined the Confederacy and died in the war.

After the county council voted to approve its removal in September, the   
Move the Monument Coalition raised more than $80,000 to relocate the   
statue to Cross Keys Battlefield in Harrisonburg, Virginia, according to  
 Ridgely Ochs, a member of the coalition’s leadership team. The historic  
 battlefield is in the care of the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields   
Foundation.

Many memorials to the Confederacy were taken down in the wake of the   
2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis police   
custody. The monuments have long been viewed by many as symbols of white  
 supremacy.

The effort to remove this statue, not the first, grew out of people’s   
desire to do something concrete after Floyd’s death, Ochs said.

We’re all extraordinarily and profoundly happy that it has happened,”

"I used to work on the Skyline drive of Shenandoah National Park. 

As the other commentor said, usually with inclement weather you're allowed to Pay to Enter then park the vehicle and hike wherever. Most commonly, right around entrances, they have large gates they close and lock to keep drivers off the Drive. So you will probably pay, park and hike all within 3-5 minutes. 

I am also going to give you an insider phone number to call; it's a Road Status Line. 

Dial this number >!540 999 3500!< press 8 and within moments a status report is given, usually one of these

A: Park is open to all traffic 

B: Park is open only to critical maintenance

C: Emergency Use Only

<Edit> D: sections are closed. So Front Royal to thorton, or Swift Run to Waynesboro. Usually, they'll indicate pretty clearly where is open or closed. 

It's very easy from Harrisonburg to pop over on Rt33 and wind up on the Mtn at Swift Run Gap entrance. However, at Rt211 Entrance [Thorton Gap, Luray] there is more ample accommodations right upon entering, for example, Mary's Rock hike is super close and Panorama has restrooms, more parking. I concede, this is further and with gas prices as they are, probably not the better option. 

Ultimately, be safe, make a plan, have Emergency preparations, extra food, water, clothing and above all; an outside contact not going with to wait up. Someone who says ""wait, it's 5:30 and OP never called and said 'made it back safely.'

"Here in harrisonburg it doesn't look like much snow, maybe a little in the mountains tho.  We have great hiking everywhere around here.  SNP is a pretty good drive from harrisonburg.... You could head west and get to those mountains a little faster without worrying about closed roads.  

I'd suggest parking at wild oak parking area in stokesville and doing the a hike up lookout mountain, there is a crazy rock out cropping you can access with about a 30 minute hike from the parking area.  Takes 40 min to get to parking area from downtown.

Another good one is fridley gap which is on the massanutten ridge, the hike is a little longer and harder, but again there is an awesome rock formation on the ridge that you can see forever from.  parking area prob 25 min from downtown.

"yard signs are definitely not the norm here.  Online I'd be watching zillow (you can set it up to email you when something new that fits your search comes up) or craigslist to a lesser extent.

Also, depending on what kind of housing you are looking for (house or apartment) I'd also try calling some of the local real estate offices that handle rentals.  Matchbox is a big one, and they have tons of rentals (many are student, but they also handle plenty that are regular housing).  Priority Management is another, although smaller.  

The market is so crazy right now, many rentals are being rented word of mouth.... they never even get to the internet.

"Hotel Madison is very close to downtown. Best restaurants downtown imo are the following: Boboko, Bella Luna, Cuban Burger, Billy Jacks, Jack Browns, Mashita, Magnolias and a little farther away, but walkable is Local Chophouse and Grill (higher priced). For desert, Klines ice cream is walkable too. 

There are a few walkable breweries/cidery as well.  My favorite are Pale Fire and Sage Bird Ciderworks. Both allow food to be brought in so we will normally bring food in and get drinks and hangout and eat dinner at one of those two. 

For breakfast there is Magpie (longish wait sadly) and Heritage bakery(Isabel the owner is great!) which are wonderful . A nice lunch place is Lola’s delicatessen. 

For shopping there are some downtown. If you are a female, there are several women clothing stores (yellow Button and Green Hummingbird). Agora market has a few shops inside it that are fun. Oasis has some great artwork and jewelry from local artists and withSimplicity is a local cosmetic store. 

Saturday morning has a great farmers market downtown that has a wonderful Mexican style chocolatier, several bakeries, local farmers with fresh fruit/veg, and some craft people. In May some of the food trucks/stalls should be back too. 

Outside of downtown there is good food too (La Morena, Xenias, AA Kabob, The Little Grill Collective for breakfast, Brothers Brewery) and Dayton Farmers market is nice too. I can’t speak to wineries as I’m not a wine person, but there are a lot around the city. Bluestone has been a fav among friends, but there are more too. 

If y’all are at all antique mall people about 25 miles south is one of the largest antique malls in the USA too, Factory Antique Mall in Verona.

""you don't get the comcast hate""   It's not about comcast so much as it is about HFC.  Cable modems, or HFC (hybrid fiber/coax) is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE technology.  That's what you aren't understanding.  HFC  is more complex, less reliable, slower, significantly less bandwidth that is shared with far more people than it should be, virtually ALWAYS comes with data caps, and has GARBAGE upload speeds.  In comparison, PON is much simpler, more reliable, faster, significantly MORE bandwidth shared with less people, has NO data caps and amazing upload speeds.

Like I said, this isn't subjective.  Fiber is objectively better.  There is not a single aspect of HFC that is better than fiber.  Not.a.single.aspect.  You made the wrong decision, that's all there is to it.

Challenges include constraints from lack of staff at clinics, labs and vendors, as well as supply chain issues with at-home tests causing an influx of people seeking community testing opportunities, according to Perry.""",t2_8q7e55gr,LavenderEyePillow,0,1642083236.0,0,t1_hshl08d,hshl08d,True,SaidTheMountain,t3_s24ufn,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrisonburg/comments/s24ufn/the_central_shenandoah_valley_health_district_is/,The Central Shenandoah Valley Health District is running low on funding for COVID tests and could run out of money for that program in about a week,/r/harrisonburg/comments/s24ufn/the_central_shenandoah_valley_health_district_is/hshl08d/,2,r/harrisonburg,0,2

Grand Caverns is less than 30 minutes from Harrisonburg.  If its a rainy/cold, go to Grand Caverns. There are some outdoor activities there as well, but the caverns will be the main focus.  
  
Luray Caverns are also really good.  There's also an auto museum there that is pretty interesting.  Luray is about 45 minutes.  I'd say, if you have a sunny/warm day, go to Luray and you can stop by Storybook Trail on the way there/home.  To get to Luray you go across the Massanutten ridge, and at the top there is a road you take for maybe a 1/2 mile, then there is a quarter mile, paved, super easy hiking trail to get to the Storybook Trail overlook.

We have a cat and rabbit, but love animals of all types. We love to cook and host guests. I enjoy composting and i used to grow food out of five gallon buckets when I lived in the mountains. I am looking forward to returning to a lush area and learning about the native plants in the Shenandoah Valley! Keep me posted about your yard plans; there is much bounty to be had in a small plot of land. I am interested in some version of 'secular' church, being a recovering churchgoer in the South for many years. I deeply value a space to make communal connections, so if you feel invested in a space, I would love to hear more about it. When we visited, I took note of the several coops, collectives, and localized food sourcing and community organizations in the area. The parks are also beautiful, and we would be interested in hosting an introductory mixer come summertime for those interested! Thanks for posting; we make the connections we can these days.

"Ooh thanks for sharing. This is so interesting and I hadn't heard about these groups before. It's so tough because I value so much of what religion offers--growing up as a Catholic, the community, ritual, and symbolism of it all was so intriguing and powerful--but that can be hard to imitate in a secular group. Mystical experiences and initiation rites too. Hopefully groups like this will continue to try to figure out how to keep the best and throw out the worst of religious groups! Think the rise of the legalization of psychedelics and all of the upheaval from COVID could add more to the mix/desire for that.

"I do not recommend Smallwood. They require the patient to pay in advance an estimate of the charges in excess of what the insurance will pay.  Then when they receive insurance payment they leave any overpayment as a credit on the patient’s account. But they don’t inform the patient of the credit or issue a refund check. Additionally, Smallwood “finds” cavities that other dentists don’t find so there are lots of opportunities for excess charges.

This happened to our family. My family went to him when our long-time dentist left the insurance network. My young son went to Smallwood for a checkup (after years of no cavities) and Smallwood found 10 cavities. We assumed that our son was not brushing well and so we had the cavities filled and paid hundreds of dollars to cover the estimated excess costs. Then my hubby went for a checkup and Smallwood found 10 cavities in his teeth also. My hubby had not had a cavity for years so he did not believe it and went to a different dentist, who found no cavities! Then I went for some work and when we discussed how much I would have to pay in advance, the clerk suggested that I apply some of the credit on my son’s account to cover it. She said there was over $450 credit! I asked her why that money was not refunded and she said that they don’t do that unless the client asks for it. But they never informed us that there was a credit building and they kept collecting more “estimated excess cost” each time my son went in to get another cavity filled. 

Needless to say, we demanded a refund of the credit and never went back to Smallwood.",t2_x8ye8fl,cweiss7,0,1637827499.0,0,t1_hm0g6cb,hm0g6cb,False,SnooBooks9725,t3_r1853v,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrisonburg/comments/r1853v/dentist_recommendatioms/,Dentist recommendatioms?,/r/harrisonburg/comments/r1853v/dentist_recommendatioms/hm0g6cb/,9,r/harrisonburg,0,9

"First people.. just so you know.. this site is a ragingly homophobic site that's masquerading as some sort of new wave ""feminism"" site. The only thing they talk about on this ""feminist"" site are the dangers of LGBTQ people, pedophilia, and zoophilia, usually in the same sentence. So maybe read this with a grain of salt. 

Secondly the message has been twisted to make it seem crazy or outright evil.  This professor doesn't want to normalize pedophilia and she's not using the term MAP to soften the image of pedophiles. She's using the term MAP because MAP and pedophiles are two different things.  Pedophiles are people who actually  acted on attraction to children. MAPs are wired to be attracted to children but do not act on it. It is a disorder that's not understood well.  In the case where someone has this attraction and actually tries to do the right thing and seek help, society treats them like they're evil. Even though they are absolutely coming out and saying that the behavior itself is wrong and they don't want to act on it.

The internet loves to get a good old rage boner whenever they hear the word pedophile, but we shouldn't ostracize and lump in the people trying to get help BEFORE they've done anything wrong.

I’ve only seen this on Reddit so I’m not sure or maybe on TickTock but I’m fairly certain that what they do is they try to pull over Uber drivers who haven’t gone through the app.  So  people flag them down like a taxi instead of going through the proper channels. Which is bullshit because it’s just two people hooking up and getting a ride but apparently since they don’t know each other there’s some kind of laws in place and they’re actually trying to give the Uber drivers a ticket or a fine—- which is revenue collection —-which is the entire point of being a cop.

"I thanked you for your efforts and upvoted your post. I’m not attacking you. I am glad you’re here. I fear a civil war in this country and I’m glad we have people that want to encourage others to exercise democracy! My BA is in Spanish (and I also speak some French, Italian, and a teeny bit of Nepali thanks to my awesome ex husband who is from Kathmandu), which I chose partly due to love of languages and partly because of my interest in the shitty things the us gov has done to Latin American countries. I’m not using my degree professionally now, I do volunteer when I can at food pantries/etc where my language skills could be helpful to those in our community. 

So please don’t think I’m attacking you. It’s just frustrating as someone that does try to get people to vote to read something directed at Harrisonburg when I know it would turn people off to see “nova’s interests” vs Harrisonburg/Rockingham county. That was all I meant, and I thank you for editing it. Also I am curious where you’re from and how many languages you speak!

"I encourage you to look into our delegates in particular. Tony Wilt is the incumbent and has been since 2010 or thereabouts. Whether you’re R or D leaning, I think Helsley has a lot of good ideas (mainly healthcare and fighting for tax dollars to come back to help with infrastructure etc in our region) and I’d rather see a change with possible progress than just vote for the incumbent because people know his name. He has done essentially nothing for citizens of the valley IMO. And I’m saying this as someone who attended one of his private fundraisers for his first race. Even then, he seemed only interested in money and ensuring those at the event that he would make sure their taxes didn’t go up. I’m not trying to pay more taxes, no one does, but I would gladly for the right reasons and I want the exorbitantly wealthy to pay their fair share.  and I would fkn love to see educators and others in Virginia make a fair wage. I’m cool paying more taxes if it means actual social change towards equity. No I’m not a communist, feel like I have to add that. I wouldn’t expect anyone to fork over all their income when they earned it.

"Thanks for changing your text from “Northern Virginia” to Harrisonburg. I want everyone to vote but when I read this yesterday it asked to keep Northern Virginia in mind. Harrisonburg and particularly the surrounding county are not represented in the interests of Nova. Kinda weird to target Richmond and then implore us to vote. I lean left for sure and almost always vote for Democrats but in local elections I’m open to hearing from anyone. This year in particular I think our area needs to get Wilt out. We have seen no change in the decade plus that he’s been our delegate. Helsley has stated that healthcare and getting state tax dollars to underrepresented areas like ours are priorities. So while I understand the whole “Richmond is making our decisions” thing, why would people in the valley care what Nova wants because the economy and education are not the same. We need true representation and I would like to see tax dollars go to education (increased teacher pay and easier access in a financial sense to higher Ed for students).

"This answer is only necessarily accurate to the one elementary school I know closely, but is probably the case elsewhere as well: the classroom teachers’ lunch breaks are the same duration as their students’ breaks (between 20-30 minutes). Where the article talks about teachers not getting lunch breaks, it is because they are working through lunch in order to keep planning upcoming instruction.  There are times when students aren’t in the classroom and are at “specials” (art, music, etc.), but these times are generally filled with grade-level meetings or other meetings about SOLs or IEPs for individual students. 

Basically, with things as they are now, there is no time during “contracted hours” that teachers have free to plan their lessons (which are required by the state and city to be written out and written in a certain way), so teachers are required to bring work home to work at night or on weekends, etc. This one hour a day doesn’t solve all of those problems but it does help ease the burden of feeling like more is being asked of them than can realistically be expected.",t2_nqiq7,Crystalvalen,0,1632378131.0,0,t1_hdxock4,hdxock4,False,SaidTheMountain,t3_ptioch,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrisonburg/comments/ptioch/harrisonburg_schools_to_shave_an_hour_from_their/,Harrisonburg schools to shave an hour from their days starting Oct. 4; TikTok-inspired vandalism hits school bathrooms,/r/harrisonburg/comments/ptioch/harrisonburg_schools_to_shave_an_hour_from_their/hdxock4/,3,r/harrisonburg,0,3

You down. 64 can get bad fog in the morning going over Afton Mountain and there is a hill after exit 114 that will have the sun blind you if there are no clouds and you are driving during certain time of the year. It’s pretty dangerous so be careful there. Overall I was almost part of 1 and saw 3 other close by crashes on 64 during the 10 months I commuted so be careful!

"I've done it for years.  It's half a dozen of one six of the other.

I81 is fine and a bit faster depending on where you're headed,  but it can be nerve wracking in the rain or bad weather. The traffic is usually good. you can use google to see if there's a wreck before you hit it. IF THERE IS A WRECK don't ignore it, you're looking at  a huge delay just reroute.  Also staties and sheriff  are out there really often so learn to drive no faster than 5 above the speed limit or you'll get a ticket eventually.  It's a pleasant drive and you can zone out and listen to podcasts. You'll also want sunglasses as the glare can be brutal on some days  The time frame you're looking at should be pretty quiet traffic wise so you should be fine 99% of the time.

&#x200B;

33is slower, more active driving involved. You can also run into delays but it's a bit rarer.  The trade off is slower transit to work every day in exchange for not randomly hitting an hour delay from a traffic jam.

But realistically in my experience, glofiber is superior--I have the 300mbps, pay $63 a month and have never had less than 260mbps ever--99% of the time I'm 25-75mbps OVER the 300...when I was with comcast I was paying for 200 and rarely got above 100--every call boosted me for a day or two up to 150, but it never lasted.",t2_8i49ofcx,unlucky-chicken10,0,1628702606.0,0,t1_h8k20mu,h8k20mu,True,TakesInsultToSnails,t3_p2gssi,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrisonburg/comments/p2gssi/glofiber_or_xfinity_internet/,Glofiber or Xfinity internet?,/r/harrisonburg/comments/p2gssi/glofiber_or_xfinity_internet/h8k20mu/,6,r/harrisonburg,0,6
"The Xfinity I had in the area was a lot slower and more expensive than glofiber. As someone new Comcast might be able to offer better rates/speeds but will increase their prices over time. If you are here for short term than it may not be a bad option. 

After having both, definitely prefer glofiber.",t2_7ogbp,arcxiii,0,1628701032.0,0,t1_h8jycae,h8jycae,True,TakesInsultToSnails,t3_p2gssi,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrisonburg/comments/p2gssi/glofiber_or_xfinity_internet/,Glofiber or Xfinity internet?,/r/harrisonburg/comments/p2gssi/glofiber_or_xfinity_internet/h8jycae/,4,r/harrisonburg,0,4
