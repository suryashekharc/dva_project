FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"I lived in North Bay when I completed my BScN. Back then it was a collaborative program between Nip U and Canadore. While I am sure the pandemic has effected the clinical placements, hopefully things will have begun to improve. The school itself is nothing exceptional, but I appreciated the smaller class sizes allowed for good communication with professors. My class started with approximately 100 students, but the group gets divided into different classes through the semesters. 

As mentioned by /u/notalibrarian, nursing textbooks are very, very expensive. The first semester of first year rung up $2000 in textbooks. Half of them you will barely use, so I'd recommend renting, kijiji, or other methods Jack Sparrow might approve of.

NBRHC itself is a very pretty facility. It only opened in 2011 so it is very modern. I used to describe it as a small hospital in a big building. It is large in size, but has mostly resources similar to a smaller hospital. No interventional cardiology, neurology, real traumas flown out, etc.

North Bay itself is a small city, reminded me in many ways of Orillia. Lots of nature nearby. I used to run the campus trails regularly and always enjoyed it. You won't find anything exotic in North Bay, but the general essential stores are nearby. They built up the area near the university a little while back with more stores. 

As for residence, I lived in residence 3 of my 4 years. 2 in townhouses, 1 in one of the apartment complexes. I enjoyed the experience. Being close to classes I would sometimes head home between classes. I am not sure if it still exists, but there used to be a bar on campus.

Some things change if you are at canadore as an exchange program / international student I believe, so your best bet is probably to email student services and they can connect you with someone in the program who deals with that.

"Ok sooooo...

I'm not with the college, they contacted me to write it because of my experience in the field. So know that going in haha

I wrote it with Unity as the intended game engine, though the language in the outline is vague so that the course outline still works if they decide to bring in a professor that has more experience in Unreal, for instance. C# is indeed the scripting language of Unity, which I guess I missed some parts where I referenced the language specifically. Why I went this route over teaching c++ is because...

I went through a game design / dev course myself back in the day. The ""traditional"" course I see (and a lot of schools seem to teach) is both really outdated AND highly theoretical, and teaches classes in stuff like html and writing engines from scratch and all these things that have nothing at all to do with prepping the next generation of game designers / developers to enter the workforce and be a viable candidate. For reference, I believe of my graduating class from the college I went to, I'm the only person that ""made it"". I now run the development division of an interactive studio who make games and interactive apps, and the course is basically designed such that if you did well, someone like me wouldn't skip a beat hiring one of the graduates of this program. Also checked in with some buds at Ubisoft, EA / DICE, and some independent studios to get second options. I felt really strongly that I kinda had the deck stacked against me entering the workforce, and I'm hoping one of the legacies of this program is that graduates have a WAY easier go of entering the workforce than I did. 

Oh also, another feature I'm pretty proud of: I wrote it so that each semester has a kinda prolonged ""game jam"" style class where you take what you are learning and apply it to a game! Then everyone plays and critiques. No other courses I'd seen actually had you like.. making games during the course haha. Crazy important, it's built right into the core of the thing.

Not sure if you're picking up on it, but I am super invested in making sure students get their money's worth and get into the field haha

Computer wise, as long as they stuck with my intent and are teaching Unity, it runs on Mac, and in fact can help in some instances (iPad games require you to build on a MacBook through xcode, for instance). Only requirement would be that it's good enough to run it, if they in fact are using Unity. 

Instructors: I met their first hire, I don't remember his name, he had a doctorate, seemed like a good guy

In terms of learning art: yes! One thing that will make you more hireable, especially at smaller game studios, is being a solid generalist. Course covers modeling, texturing, all the fun art stuff on top of the actual development side

Hopefully this does an ok job conveying the course as I designed it. In a nutshell, the plan is to learn all parts of making a game, and then a lot of energy goes into using that knowledge to actually make them. In theory you should have I think 5 working game prototypes for your portfolio when you graduate so that you can immediately start looking for work

If you have any other questions, by all means lemme know - like I said I wrote this thing to give people the leg up I feel like I didn't get entering the workforce.

"Wow, that's amazing! :) I have a few questions first off as I'm comparing similar programs (online and in-person ones) to choose from:

\- What programming languages does this cover? I looked at some of the course outlines, and it looks like C#. However, some other programs teach C/C++ instead. I'm wondering why C# (correct me if I'm wrong) was chosen?  
\- Is it possible to use a Macbook to do this whole program?   
\- How are the instructors?   
\- Does this program touch on learning how to do some design/art work for the games we would build?  
\- I think it's a relatively new program, however, are there any videos describing the program, or course open house videos?

Like most of Ontario, housing prices spiked during the last few years.  House prices are still much lower than southern Ontario, but double what they were five years ago.  This is happening everywhere, but a lot of locals seem to think it‚Äôs isolated to North Bay.  

The downtown has great local shops and there is a farmers market in the summer.  The general opinion amongst locals is negative, but it‚Äôs actually a nice downtown.  There are some vacant storefronts right now because covid.  

I really like brunch at Average Joes, Good Glaze donut shop downtown, and the Duschesnay Falls trail for things to do.

"I moved to the city last year and personally like the West End. It's a bit of a longer walk now that they put a fence up blocking the waterfront but there's still easy access. I personally like the close proximity to downtown and the idea that it's over run with crime isn't something I've seen. Maybe it's just because I came from downtown Toronto but even then I just don't see it.

Grocery stores are a bit far away, North Bay is a tough place to navigate without a car. When I moved here, it's actually the first time I've owned a car.

North Bay certainly is a bit of an adjustment but if you like the outdoors and a city that's small but not too small, it's nice up here.

Oh and the winter...I'd suggest you visit sometime around now so you know what you're getting yourself into.

Also TW Foods isn't a complete grocery shop, but good for a few things. Lots of other great shops to go into as well, and close to the waterfront.

"I rescued a feral cat once when I was in university but put it up for adoption through the SPCA once it had recovered. They billed me $150 for that which put me through a lot of economic hardship.

In that case I reported it to the animal control officer and told them that if nobody claims it then I would be interested in adopting it.

"Using stats from The Canadian at Washago isn't exactly a fair comparison. The Eastbound stats are completely useless - at that point, the train has traveled all the way from Vancouver, so it's on-time performance has nothing to do with the Bala Sub the Northlander would use. The Westbound stats are applicable from a track perspective, but also difficult to compare. The Canadian is a very different service than the Northlander, and massive inbound delays often affect outbound service. Even at that, only 7.1% of trains are more than 60 minutes late at Washago. I would guess that OTP and not being early at Washago is a minor concern for the Canadian, so a more regional service like the Northlander is likely to have better schedule adherence at local stops.

This isn't to discount the congestion south of Parry Sound, but just to put those charts in some perspective. It would probably make more sense to look at GO's performance on the Richmond Hill line than VIA's.",t2_ajar2,CatenaryLine,0,1639513248.0,0,t1_hojzcjy,hojzcjy,True,NorTracksBlog,t3_rg9386,https://www.reddit.com/r/northbay/comments/rg9386/editorial_smoke_and_mirrors_checking_the_choo/,Editorial : Smoke and mirrors checking the choo choo tracks,/r/northbay/comments/rg9386/editorial_smoke_and_mirrors_checking_the_choo/hojzcjy/,2,r/northbay,0,2

I also think it is gross that these people were ignorant enough to assume that their presence (i.e. large crowd, yelling, cursing, et cetera) would be reassuring to these children.   Not sure how their POV would negate the experiences of those wanting a vaccine.

\-Once you've applied through OCAS, you'll gat a confirmation email from OCAS, and, assuming you're selected, an acceptance letter from Canadore. This email will have your student ID in it, and you'll need it in a bit.

\-Next, log on to the [Self Serve](https://ss.canadorecollege.ca:7009/PROD/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin) website, and to sign in, your user ID is your student number, and your first time password is your date of birth (day,month,year). You should be prompted to change your password, and I highly recommend doing so.

\-Then you'll navigate to ""Student"" at the top of the page, and then to ""Post Secondary Web Registration. Make sure you've also paid your tuition by this point, or it won't let you in.

"Hi there! Lived in North Bay from ages 12-18, residing mostly in the GTA now for university. My experience may be different from other folks who have commented because I‚Äôm younger and and lived with loving parents, but I am East Asian so maybe I can talk a little about my experience with being a POC. 

North Bay is a mostly white community. But, I am friends with a few POC. I can confirm that myself and every single one of my POC friends have experienced racism or some form of micro aggression more than once while living in North Bay. Though, personally, I haven‚Äôt experienced anything that bad that has scarred me. Imo, for a lot of the racism/micro aggressions, I‚Äôve chalked it up to people not being educated and not living around POC or around other cultures (because, again, it is a pretty white city). But, imo again, you‚Äôd experience microaggressions everywhere. 

When it comes to food, bigger cities definitely have more authentic Asian food, but North Bay does have a great sushi place and Indian restaurants, tho obviously not as authentic or diverse as e.g. GTA. My family cooks a lot of our Chinese foods and meals using ingredients bought from the GTA (we make ~monthly trips down to the GTA). But grocery stores in north bay do have Asian ingredients in stock, just no where as plentiful.

Also, I see people in this comment thread mentioning that the area of North Bay matters. I agree. There are some areas with older buildings and other areas that are super nice. There‚Äôs definitely places where you will see drug addicts and homelessness (very unfortunate), but then again, in what city would you not see this. I would say most of North Bay is pretty nice though. I did live in a nicer area, so my experience may be biased towards the positives. 

All that being said, I do love North Bay and am grateful for having grown up there. Especially comparing my life there with living in a bigger city now, I have grown to value the small town vibes, nature, cold snow, and friendliness of folks in smaller cities. Imo, strangers in North Bay are friendlier than strangers in the GTA (especially in customer service, in passing, etc.)",t2_86mu9r68,Parking-Ad-6066,0,1637729758.0,0,t1_hlv4eus,hlv4eus,True,lilmsssunshine,t3_r0ha2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/northbay/comments/r0ha2p/living_in_north_bay/,Living in North Bay,/r/northbay/comments/r0ha2p/living_in_north_bay/hlv4eus/,2,r/northbay,0,2

"Born and raised in North Bay here! Can‚Äôt speak to POC experience, however I agree with the other commenter that North Bay has become increasingly progressive over the years. It‚Äôs a university town so lots of students (including exchange students that bring lots of diversity ro a once very conservative town). The local business sector has really taken off, we have some great little restaurants and a couple of good small shops. The trails are beautiful, the beaches are great and there‚Äôs a good selection of different sporting activities including ultimate frisbee. There is a drug problem - but its everywhere, that‚Äôs not exclusive to North Bay. There are some areas of town to avoid, but there are lots of great areas in town. Our downtown is slowly improving, and we will be getting a new mayor as the current one is no longer running, and I personally feel like that will make an enormous positive change, current mayor is pretty corrupted from what I can gather. We have an OHL team if you enjoy watching hockey, as well as our university team is great hockey to watch. Our mall is decent and we have some great chain stores we didnt used to have including Homesense, Taco Bell, Starbucks, PetSmart and will also be getting a Popeyes. We also have a year round farmers market where you can get fresh produce, baked goods and support small artisans every Saturday all year long! I love it here.

"Been here nearly two years and I have a few complaints, mostly with the drugs and those who do them. Some (very few) people just do not respect your property. It's probably a great town if you don't live near a trashy apt building. The suburbs are nice. The trails are nice. 

A mentally ill guy punched my car mirror clean off because his backpack got caught on it. 

3 people OD'd outside my apt door.

This is a place for nature and outdoor sports. It's not like we don't have sushi restaurants and a movie theatre but something feels missing and I'm not even sure what it is. Comfort? Excitement? Jobs?

I also experienced racism in the first month I was here, for being something like 1/16th native and white.

"So first off, find the times for Lakeshore routes on the website here: 

[https://www.northbay.ca/services-payments/north-bay-transit/transit-routes-schedules-effective-tuesday-september-7-2021/](https://www.northbay.ca/services-payments/north-bay-transit/transit-routes-schedules-effective-tuesday-september-7-2021/)

These routes are fixed, so they run at the scheduled times and you will have to change buses to them at a transfer point (usually the terminal). Sunday times are in bold, so find the one to get to work on time and then plan on getting to the terminal by that time. 

The app will plan trips using the Lakeshore routes, but only in real-time. If you have to be somewhere by a certain time, you'll want to start planning your trip early the first couple of times to get an idea of how long it will take - you can put in your start and finish points and it will show you the time you will arrive. If it says you'll arrive an hour earlier than you need to be there, then try again in 15 minutes and see what it says, again in 15 minutes, and book when it's comfortable. After a time or two, you'll know how early you need to book to get somewhere.

The current fare rules in North Bay don't allow circular trips regardless of type of ride, so you'd have to pay both ways to accompany someone on the bus, and book a separate return trip. I am not sure about people without a phone, they would have to find a way to contact dispatch. If you have the app, you can book on behalf of your kids though, having them call you is possibly easier than having them call dispatch, and then you will be able to see their trip on your phone.

"North Bay is trialing Dynamic Dispatching as transit ridership was low during the pandemic. It doesn't make a lot of sense to have 4 or 5 buses out driving in circles almost empty when demand is low. The company they chose to implement this with is VIA, a well known provider of this software. While you can call dispatch to book a ride, the app is the best way to do it.

This video from England explains the system well enough, they use the same VIA system: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ddExZbKD8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ddExZbKD8)

North Bay's Dynamic Dispatching runs from 7pm-11pm weekdays, 7pm-10pm Saturday and 8am-7pm Sunday, except West Ferris routes which continue as normal. I haven't been in North Bay much during the pandemic, but I tried the Dynamic Dispatching a few months ago when I was in town. It's not a taxi by any means as you may have to wait a while for a bus and the bus might make multiple stops, but the trips were much more direct and there are no transfers outside of West Ferris. The app gives good ETAs and you can wait inside until the bus is getting close and then walk to your stop.

The biggest restriction is that the bus only makes pickup/dropoff ad existing transit stops, so they won't get you closer to home. I would suggest trying the app if you are able to, it's much easier than calling in.",t2_ajar2,CatenaryLine,0,1637466201.0,0,t1_hlgv9qq,hlgv9qq,True,peppy_dee1981,t3_qykuc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/northbay/comments/qykuc2/busses/,Busses,/r/northbay/comments/qykuc2/busses/hlgv9qq/,3,r/northbay,0,3

"Yes, my wife and I are fluent in several languages including French and Spanish. So no, we are not trying to vicariously live through our children (Talk about judgmental assumptions!).   


Regardless, from a neuroplasticity and brain structure point of view, studying multiple languages is ALWAYS a good idea, even if not used as adults. It wires a brain for growth. Forget about future options to study and work around the world.

The only clinic I was aware of that had started seeing ppl in person again (after a screening) was Blue Sky but that's not helpful to OP if they aren't already a patient.",t2_2e0xjj8l,MelindaLain,0,1634682616.0,0,t1_hhahdo8,hhahdo8,False,makemeflyy,t3_qaxanm,https://www.reddit.com/r/northbay/comments/qaxanm/best_walk_in_clinics_and_doctors/,Best walk in clinics and doctors?,/r/northbay/comments/qaxanm/best_walk_in_clinics_and_doctors/hhahdo8/,3,r/northbay,0,3
"Walk in clinics should be screening people to determine if you can be assessed over the phone or if you need to be seen in person. I can‚Äôt speak for whether or not some of the clinics are actually following that directive. I know that in early COVID a lot of walk in clinics simply closed to in person assessments but as numbers stabilize they should be seeing more patients in office. 

I‚Äôd call good doctors (or the walk in clinic on lakeshore) and ask about their protocol.

"Sadly, the waitlist for a family doctor is loooong. And I don't know of any who are accepting new patients. It took me about two years when I moved back... And that was ten years ago.

Best advice I can offer is to call Drs offices and inquire. Regularly. Maybe you'll get lucky and call just as a spot becomes available.
