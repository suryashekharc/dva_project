"I have heard that too... and my understanding is that it's basically because they are government buildings.   
Buildings built before the 70's might have lead paint, or even asbestos.   
If I owned it: I would call my brother or one of my buddies and have him spray a mist of water into the air right where I'm chopping, and chop all of the asbestos out, while we are both wearing masks. (this is how the asbestos abatement companies do it)   
But since it is a public school, they have to use a ""licensed asbestos abatement company"" and the price is through the roof.   And it's a big building, so multiply that ""getting screwed"" by 74 classrooms.
   
This is just one example, but my point is that the government can't cut any corners with those things and therefore they end up paying a lot more than you or I would pay.

It takes less than a half-step further in thought to understand the idea that it's keeping people alive.

Your implication is that you want them to die, whether you meant it or not, and people around you and in your life see you.

When you provide people with safety (and yes, up to and including safe drug use) gives them the opportunity to make better choices.

There are dozens of studies that prove safety and security leads to recovery far greater than punishing and stigmatizing addiction. People don't use for funsies, and they don't start using for funsies.

I was moved out of Lansing schools at the end of elementary school.

It all boils down to opportunities. I had more good opportunities than my childhood friends and they had more bad opportunities. My normal classes were what they learned in AP classes. I had better access to learning resources and better teachers. Also there were a ton more fights and violence at Lansing schools. My whole high school experience had maybe 2 fights and isolated accounts of stereotypical bullying. My childhood friends have a fountain of endless stories of fights and violence.

I can’t leave. I won’t leave. There were drive bys last year targeting a house across the street. In response, I’ve increased my investment in the neighborhood. Detroit is on a come up and has been for a few years because of community investment.

This goal that I share with the larger community is absolutely hampered by that p*ss baby Andy Schor.

But one ~13,000 people voted in the mayoral election. I’m hoping I can do more this year to ramp up community involvement. I can understand wanting to get away from it all, but if you stay in the Lansing area, please join my effort to get more townies involved and increase our shared stake in the stability of Lansing. I plan to raise my kids to adulthood here, and so that’s enough for me to get engaged.

So I hope, if you do stick around, to help make Lansing the city it could be.

"Burner account here, lifetime Lansing area and 20 years Eastside resident, now former as of this week. 


I had been trying my to move my family out of the wonderful Eastside that has been our home since before we bought one here. But when I saw the crime tape around a house and lawn with a CSI van out front and Lansing Police Command watching from the bike co-op across the street 6 doors from my house, I knew it was time to intensify my efforts. The VERY NEXT DAY when the SAME EXACT SCENE happened at the house next door, the last straw broke. At that point my wife and I threw it into Fifth gear, sold the second car, liquidated a minor 401K from a past job, and bounced the FUCK out. I don’t need a fucking Eastside Neighborhood  Association Newsletter to tell me that my neighborhood is dead. the two sets of neighbors across the street who are moving to new homes didn’t need one either. 


Lansing’s Eastside is done folks, and while rolling into Denver yesterday to hear that this 4 person shooting on Magnolia and Michigan occurring just doors from my wife's best friend reinforced that. Lansing isn’t safe, and you’re going to see more and more people like us leave, turn our houses into working professional rentals since property values are bonkers most desirable places to live outside of Lansing, so why would we sell both houses to have a house payment elsewhere? Why would a family even consider buying my houses on the Eastside knowing that Lansing is going to RISE from the 9th most violent city in america to an even higher top ten spot. I’m better off holding and keeping the neighborhood from seeing more families who won’t be coming and just be part of the “problem” by not having my family invested in the community. But at least my kid’s chances of being struck by an random bullet went down by my own personal “white flight”, something I always was bitter about my parents participating in when they left Detroit after the riots. Now with a 3 year old of my own, I can’t say I really blame them anymore. Being an activist in both politics and in business doesn’t count for shit when you're dead or paralyzed, or your family is injured or killed in random violence.


It’s very important to lay the blame where it is due. Andy Schor fired the Ward Sergeants as a part of restructuring for cost and to have HIS police force. Well Lansing, how do you feel about that giant vagina of a human now? The coward who lied to us in our driveways, who ran back behind his jackbooted thugs when the Flint Police talked town their community in the riots two years ago, and who said he “felt attacked” when this business owner and three others (very mild mannered women) asked non-threatening questions at their “Re-imagine the avenue” snow-job press event. Andy Schor has proven to be completely beholden to big money and the developers who are robbing our city blind. It’s telling when my progressive bleeding liberal friend business owners who are saying, “Fuck man, Verg was an asshole but we need him back.” And this progressive agrees. And the proof is that my city turned into a warzone. Thanks Andy. I hope the bullets terrorizing my friends in my neighborhood find you next.",t2_jijmfogc,NoLightOnMe,0,1647614044.0,0,t1_i15ofwk,i15ofwk,True,helenata,t3_tgpjsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/tgpjsr/eastside_party/,Eastside party?,/r/lansing/comments/tgpjsr/eastside_party/i15ofwk/,-13,r/lansing,0,-13

"Introducing James, Lupin, and Sirius!

These precious boys were house cats that were dumped to live outside and fend for themselves. Indoor cats do not have the instincts or training to live outside, and most of them do not adapt to survive. These 3 boys were slowly withering away while seeking shelter in an unused dog house until they ran up to greet one of our fosters!

These boys are in rough shape, but were thankfully taken in just in time. They've since began treatment for fleas, worms, and are receiving three gravy filled meals a day! 😻

They're acclimating perfectly to inside life, but will need extensive medical care including treatment for their worms and fleas, neuter surgery, and vaccines.

If you're able, please consider donating to Happy Feet Pet Rescue for their medical care! These funds go directly to the care of animals, and allow us to take in emergency cases like these 3 cutie pies!

"I hope you can find contentment here in Lansing. It is so not New York city, but it is totally livable. 

Some answers:

1. There is a Meijer grocery store right downtown, a few blocks from capital. 
2. Instacart and such services are available and viable if that is what you prefer.
3. Depends on where you live. I am in a 100 year old house so gas and electricity can get expensive especially in the winter. 
4. Depending on where you live there are usually 2-3 ISP options. You should not have a problem finding the internet speeds you require.

"1. You’ll mostly need somewhere big although there are some cool alternatives emerging 
2. Not sure how far instacart delivers but it’s never been an issue—most stores like Walmart or Meijer (main grocery around here) have many locations all over. 
3. 200-300mo for a three bed house
4. Metronets been great for me. Gig internet for $70mo
5. Not sure on this—but no longer need a permit to park in residential areas etc if that’s what you mean (they changed it a few times). 
6.  There are ok bus lines in some spots but lansing was basically designed around cars unfortunately. 
7. Eastside is the best side if you want to live in lansing proper. Good cost of living around here and some solid fun things to do, particularly in summer. Plus it’s close to everything & busses.

They're not a club, but I bet you could take some coffee in and talk to the lady who runs it for hours (head in through the main door, turn right and go through another door and across a hallway.  You'll see all sorts of art and the lady sitting there is cool and knowledgable)

Even 8-9 years ago, this was the key to finding a house (for me at least). I had to take control and do the research to find properties I liked. My otherwise OK realtor wasn't looking for houses nearly continuously like I was. I bet they were looking once a week or just intermittently. Or at least it sure seemed like they weren't on top of things at the pace they were showing me homes and what types of homes they were showing to me previous to me doing all the searching.

"That's super interesting about escalation clauses possibly being ignored. We've done escalation clauses a few times (combined with an initial offer still a fair amount over asking) and I was worried they might not look as good as a high offer from the start or are being ignored, but our agent assured us she's only seen one situation where an escalation clause was missed/not taken into account. So maybe we'll try a straight high offer next time. 

It seems like a significant majority of the houses in the area that've been on the market for a while are there for a reason beyond just being listed for too much - any halfway-decent house gets snapped up within a week or two regardless of the listing price. But I will continue to keep an eye out. 

We haven't tried offering right out of the gate on a new listing yet, so I think we will give that a try if we're able to get in early (sometimes even getting showings scheduled has been a struggle since so many places book up so early, our agent does send other people from her office if they're available to get us in sooner).  But I feel like this might be our best bet.

"I know someone who went through something very similar. One of the best parts of getting in touch with EVE was that they were able to take some of the mental load off, so it becomes a little less overwhelming. They work out the logistics so that you have a plan, and they connect you with their lawyer. So then all that’s left for you to do is execute the plan. Which is still a lot to handle, but at least there’s a clear step-by-step outline of what you need to do. 

In the meantime, offering emotional support and reminding her why she’s doing this in the first place is helpful. When you’re faced with the huge, and dangerous, hurdle of leaving the abuser, it’s hard not to get sucked back into the relationship because everything else seems like it’s too much to accomplish.

I bought last April, but this is what I did. We saw the house right away, it was a Thursday. We put an offer $15k (5%) over ask, with a commitment to cover up to half that amount if the appraisal came in light. As part of the offer, we respectfully requested a response within the day because we planned to look at several houses that weekend.

They accepted our offer, and the appraisal did come in light, so we saved money from our initial offer, but the seller also got to sell for over the asking, so it was a win-win.",t2_6rpnu,sabatoa,0,1647260052.0,0,t1_i0lwp1p,i0lwp1p,False,wildebeesting,t3_tdmnwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/tdmnwl/home_buying_advice/,Home Buying Advice,/r/lansing/comments/tdmnwl/home_buying_advice/i0lwp1p/,2,r/lansing,0,2

"Lansing Realtor here, and the first thing I will tell you is you're not alone. Many of the buyers I've worked over the last 2 years have had the exact same situation (I've even had buyers write a dozen or more offers before getting something accepted). That being said, it can be done and you will find a house if you keep looking.

It sounds like you're doing the right things, there are a few other tricks I've had success with, but you're hitting all the major points. Waiving inspections and appraisal is risky, especially with how high prices are right now and if there is any chance you will try to sell the house again in the next few years, but it is an effective way to get sellers' attention. It's possible you are being beaten out by cash offers (typically your agent should be able to find out why you lost out from the listing agent) but it's also possible others are just offering higher. Escalation clauses are not a bad route, but when there are a dozen other offers on the table the chances are good others have them too or the sellers are just ignoring them and going with the highest offer. Appraisal guarantees are a good way to go if you have the cash, but also risky because it means you are starting out already under water on the house, so if your financial situation changes, you could be in trouble, but again, if you're planning to live there for five or more years, you should be okay.

My biggest piece of advice is to just keep going. This time of year we should start seeing a huge jump in inventory, meaning more options and hopefully less competition for buyers. Like I said, you are doing the right things, making strong offers, so if you keep it up, you will get a house. My other advice would be to look through houses that have been on the market for a while, most likely they are just asking too much but if they have been listed for a while, they may be ready to come down on price. With those houses, you should have less competition as it is very unlikely to see multiple offers come in at once on a house that has been listed for a couple weeks or more already. The other strategy I've had some success with is getting in to a new listing before any other offers are in the table and writing in a higher purchase price if the sellers respond inside a short timeline (usually no more than 6-8 hours). A lot of sellers are hesitant to accept the first offer they get in this market, even if it's well over asking, because they think they will get more and even higher offers. By offering them more money if they answer quickly, it doesn't give them time to try to drum up a bidding war and puts some of the pressure on them. This has worked for me a couple times because sellers have all the power right now, but this takes some of it back for the buyer and forces the seller to decide whether it is worth losing money to try to get a bit more.

I've heard of other agents waving tax prorations and other small financial considerations to set them apart from other offers, but at the end of the day, sellers are going to go with whatever offer is going to net them the most money. So, big things are going to get more attention than lots of small ones.

Just keep at it, don't give up hope. Make sure you are seeing houses as soon as possible (if your agent isn't always able to do showings on short notice, ask if anyone else in their office is available to help, the worst is when you lose a good house because you couldn't see it quick enough). Keep making strong offers like you are and you will get a new home, just don't give up hope. I know how discouraging this market is for buyers, I feel for my clients every day and wish there was more I could do to help, but it is not impossible to get a house.",t2_7nsuq,Hayhow,0,1647257404.0,0,t1_i0lsnkt,i0lsnkt,True,wildebeesting,t3_tdmnwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/tdmnwl/home_buying_advice/,Home Buying Advice,/r/lansing/comments/tdmnwl/home_buying_advice/i0lsnkt/,18,r/lansing,1,18

"Oh I totally understand why a seller would prefer offers with appraisal guarantees and no inspections! I don’t fault them for it, it makes the process quicker and less likely to fall through. We can do the former, but an inspection is pretty important to us - not even sure if we’d try to negotiate based on findings (maaaybe something huge), but I can’t imagine not knowing what we’re getting into before buying.

That’s a great idea about the quick inspection walk-through, I hadn’t thought of that. It’s been tough even being able to get on the schedule for an initial showing, let alone a second run through, but I’m sure it wouldn’t be impossible and sounds like it could help us strengthen our offer a lot.

"I appreciate the info about what worked for you! That’s wonderful that you were able to get your second offer accepted, especially at asking price. 

That’s helpful to know about the timing of inventory, it really has been a desert out there in terms of the number of listings over the last few months (though the ones we’ve offered on have truly been gems!). We’re expecting a baby in a couple of months so we were hoping to find a place prior to his arrival, though it’s looking like that won’t happen. So I will keep my hopes up that there will be more inventory as the summer gets closer.

It seems like our agent hasn’t really heard back about why we’re losing - she’s passed along comments from sellers’ agents that say we had a great offer but they received offers with terms they couldn’t pass up, no specifics beyond that though. She did ask if we could borrow money from our parents so we could submit all-cash offers, but that isn’t an option for us.

It's not always that the seller is trying to hide something.  Appraisal guarantees and skipping inspection are two big things a buyer can offer to ensure that they will not back out.  As those are usually the last chances for a buyer to do so.

Our inspector was willing to do a quick 45 minute inspection for a reduced rate.  We asked to see the house again, had him meet us, did another run through, and submitted our offer.

He gave us the thumbs up on the more expensive things(roof, attic, foundation, etc) and we were able to ""waive inspection"" in our offer.  We also bid high and did an appraisal guarantee as well.

Good luck to you.

She can’t just up and leave for the shelter because she’s worried about him fighting for custody (anyone who has seen the show maid on Netflix gets it- hard to vanish when the law says you’re not allowed to with a kid)

"Bought \~9-10 months ago, won on the second offer. Offer package was the same for both, offered listing with an escalation clause up to $10-20k over asking and occupancy allowed post-closing, 10% down. Ended up winning on the offer at asking price, first one lost as the offer was $50k over asking (which ended up being a blessing in disguise). Waived appraisal contingency but not financing or inspection. The market is hot, but not west-coast crazy where everything gets waived.

Keep in mind if you've been looking in the last 2-3 months that inventory is usually tighter during the winter holidays and will be hitting peak stride in the next 2-3 months as people with kids don't want to move them during the school year, or move in the snow, or both.

Have you asked your agent what the winning offers are and their feedback? If they can't find out I'd have some questions. Depending on how long it's been since your first few offers you can look up the ""recently sold"" on Zillow and compare the listed and sold prices. Just spot checking a few in that range sold in the last 90 days most seem to be at asking or $10-20k max over asking in Lansing and east of Lansing.",t2_6eaas4lp,AngryWombat2,0,1647228273.0,0,t1_i0kphsq,i0kphsq,True,wildebeesting,t3_tdmnwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/tdmnwl/home_buying_advice/,Home Buying Advice,/r/lansing/comments/tdmnwl/home_buying_advice/i0kphsq/,5,r/lansing,0,5

"I lived in one on Sycamore that was built in 1912. Each half was a mirror of the other with all of the original wood trim and staircases etc. It was definitely built as a duplex.
It had one of those water cisterns in the  back of the basement. The walls of it were partially removed down to the floor level so that you could walk into them and I guess use the space as more storage? I had never heard of them before seeing those but apparently they were quite common in the 19th century. 
At one point while living there I was in a couple counties over visiting my parents. Their neighbor (who is probably in his late 70s/early 80s now) was there and when he found out I lived on Sycamore in Lansing he explained that he had been born in a duplex on that street.

"Quasi-related to OP's question: 

My partner & I are planning on getting bikes just to get around Downtown Lansing/REO town/Old Town in the warmer months. We already live Downtown Lansing, so we're not going far, and we're doing this for pleasure/eco reasons/convenience more than commuting to a job. 

What kind of bike would be recommended for this? Where should we shop for these bikes in the area? Do you think traveling between these three corridors is more safe/less safe/equally as safe for bike riders? I'm thinking the river trail will (hopefully safely) take us to a lot of these areas. 

Any input is helpful!

As for straight bike commuting it totally depends.

And before you know it, we’re friends because we like the same music, or we heard a new band we thought we wouldn’t like, and it turned out they were awesome!  I guess what I’m saying to this MAGA group, why do you feel like you have to have a separate event …. Oh…. No music!!!  What fun is that?

"If you drive just a little out of Lansing to Williamston there's a great laundromat called Grand River Laundry.
Brand new equipment, you can use quarters or they have an app you can download for free called DexterPay. It will  use any credit or debit card or apple /Google pay.
That way you don't ever have to worry about the possibility of loading money on one of those cards and losing it.
One of the cleanest laundry's I've ever been in.
You can check it out @ www.grandriverlaundry.com
Plus theres lots of places to run errands if you need while  your clothes are washing.
All the washers (20lb up to 50lb) run in 25 minutes. Dryers are on average 30-40 min.
If you don't want to do your laundry you can use the drop off service. $1.25/lb and you pick it up all clean folded ready to put away next day.

Source: Am the owner.
Before we remodeled and opened GRL we did our laundry at EVERY laundromat in a 40 Mile radius. 
Some of the places are nicer than others but (I may be biased) I feel that the quality and speed of our service beats all the other spots. Plus we have more convenient payment methods and in general are less expensive than any other laundry in the area that has equipment less than 5 years old.",t2_9nie3,nippletumor,0,1646951993.0,0,t1_i0610hr,i0610hr,True,oilerella,t3_tazbwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/tazbwh/laundromat_recommendations/,laundromat recommendations?,/r/lansing/comments/tazbwh/laundromat_recommendations/i0610hr/,4,r/lansing,0,4

"**[2008 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election)** 
 
 >The 2008 United States presidential election was the 56th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008. The Democratic ticket of Barack Obama, the junior Senator from Illinois, and Joe Biden, the senior Senator from Delaware, defeated the Republican ticket of John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, and Sarah Palin, the Governor of Alaska. Obama became the first African American to be elected to the presidency, as well as being only the third sitting United States Senator elected president, joining Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy.
 
**[2012 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_presidential_election)** 
 
 >The 2012 United States presidential election was the 57th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. Incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama and his running mate, incumbent Vice President Joe Biden, were re-elected to a second term. They defeated the Republican ticket of businessman and former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. As the incumbent president, Obama secured the Democratic nomination without serious opposition.
 
**[2020 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election)** 
 
 >The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020. The Democratic ticket of former vice president Joe Biden and the junior U.S. senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent Republican president Donald Trump and incumbent vice president Mike Pence. The election took place against the backdrop of the global COVID-19 pandemic and related recession. It was the first election since 1992, the first in the 21st century, and the fifth in the past 100 years, in which the incumbent president failed to win a second term.

"> And others saying “Oh I don’t like thing so I won’t go there”?

Because that not all it is. Like always, it when you mention MAGA/Trump on reddit, you get a bunch of name calling. It's not like it remains respectful, even if you don't like Trump. It just turns into mudslinging. 

I understand Trump isn't gonna be popular on a place that is hyperliberal like reddit. But reddit isn't a cross section of real life, or even close. You're just feeding into what we all know happens, an echo chamber. And that *is* bad. 

If you don't like Trump, fine. But a lot of people do. Trump still has a lot of support and CLEARLY popular, didn't you see the election results? 

Seriously, think about it. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election

In the 2008 election Obama got 69,498,516 votes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_presidential_election

In the 2012 election Obama got 65,915,795 votes. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

In the 2020 election Trump got 74,216,154 votes. Trump got more votes than Obama did in either of his two election runs. If Trump was as hated as he seems to be on reddit, he wouldn't have gotten more votes than Obama. People like Trump, just not on reddit.

"It’s doable. You’re going to need to spend some time figuring out what routes work best for you. 

For instance, Saginaw is extremely difficult to bike on due to traffic and debris, but you may be able to use some side streets. Kalamazoo is pothole hell this spring. Sometimes I’ll spend a day off cleaning up the bike lanes I use most frequently. 

Utilize river trail whenever possible. It is somewhat more maintained than the bike lanes. 

If you are biking at night, you MUST at minimum have a front light and flashing back light. The police do occasionally say something. I’ve never been ticketed, but it has been mentioned. Riding at night in Lansing can be a little sketchy. Plan your routes so you are stopping as few times as possible. It is also helpful to keep a notebook of incidents so you can adjust as needed. 

I personally have not been to the co-op, but live very close to it. They’re busy when open and seem to have a welcoming community built around it. If you are looking for a used bike and the co-op doesn’t have anything for you, Dicker and Deal has a metric assload. 

Last note, pick up some basic bike repair skills if you haven’t. It will be a huge money saver if you can do your own brake lines, tires, and tubes as needed. 

Biking in Lansing is a solid 5/10. It’s doable, but it’s not enjoyable most of the time.

Edit to add: Buy a LOUD bike horn or alternative. Personally I use a mini air horn. People really like to walk/run with headphones in and not have the personal awareness to look at their surroundings. You’re going to need more than your voice to get their attention and avoid accidents.

Second edit (I keep forgetting helpful stuff): Lansing isn’t available on auto-routing apps, but I’ve found that Strava is works the best. You can open the app in your browser and force it to open as a desktop page. From there you can see routes other users in Lansing take and make adjustments instead of starting from scratch.

"Year-round bike commuter here. Going west, be most straight-forward yet safe way is to go on either Michigan or Willow.

It might sound counter-intuitive at first, but you are much **safer** riding on the middle of the lane (as a regular car) than on a sidewalk. Drivers won't notice you if you're on a sidewalk and you risk being hit by them when they turn. Actually, in most accidents you are likely being hit from the side than from behind. 

Some a*hole might get mad at you by taking a car lane, but you are more likely getting hit by a distracted driver than by an angry commuter. Be as visible as possible. 

Also, wear a bright yellow vest, helmet, and have decent lights (get your lights from an actual bike shop, not Walmart or similar). If riding during the day, have them blinking.

">  I recommend taking Willow the whole way then connecting to east/west connector near the library. 

While I agree this is decent for getting specifically to the area around the library, I don't really like going down willow myself, especially for where OP is trying to go. I once took willow from Olympic Broil to Creyts, not enjoyable IMO.
