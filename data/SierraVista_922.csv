"Sierra Vista is a treasure trove for Mexican food lovers. La Casita has been around forever, the owners are super nice, and the food is delicious. 143 Street Tacos is SO good, they have a cool atmosphere, and a t shirt vending machine. Guadalajara Street Tacos Y Hot Dogs has a birra pizza that is *chef's kiss*

Pizzeria Mimosa is technically in Hereford, but worth the drive. Super cute, you can see the pizza oven and they have a little gift shop with all sorts of fun stuff, even frozen pizzas and some booze! The ambiance is really nice, sit on the patio if the weather is good, they have a great view. In town for pizza, I second the vote for Vinny's, the pizza and sandwiches are pretty good! 

For Chinese and Thai, check out Bamboo Gardens. The cook is from Bangkok, and the server is the sweetest. It's family owned, and the previous owner just retired and her granddaughter took over. Oh, they also have the best Thai Tea in town, and an amazing milk tea menu. Sometimes it can be a wait, but it's worth it.

For American, the selection is kind of small. Tandem Upscale dining is good, but kind of expensive. Great for date night! I've heard good things about the Landmark Cafe, but I haven't had a chance to personally try it. The outside looks super cute though!

Oh, and I've heard great things about Bobke's For Lunch!",t2_l3zmnq9g,2022bussinbussin,0,1648190518.0,0,t1_i21aqb8,i21aqb8,True,TheBuddhistTraveler,t3_taco9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/sierravista/comments/taco9a/best_restaurant_in_town/,Best Restaurant in town?,/r/sierravista/comments/taco9a/best_restaurant_in_town/i21aqb8/,1,r/sierravista,0,1

"Not my favorite, but places generally aren’t good or bad. Sometimes a place is a good fit, and sometimes it’s not. I grew up in a small town and SV is not a small town. It’s a small city, but resists growth in food, entertainment, etc. in spite of population growth. There isn’t much to do and good food is hard to find. We chose to come here and thought we would love it. Unfortunately, not the case. We even toyed with the idea of retiring here.  If you can try it for a few years, I say see how it fits. Some people really love it. And it’s true that a place is what you make of it. This one is just a lot of work for us to find any joy here. Other places have been effortlessly wonderful.

The two near my apartment only stayed for the night. From what it seems there was on female and 3 males. When I opened the door 3 of them flew away and one hesitantly glided towards the ground away from me. My poor dog is around the size where an owl might get tempted if hungry lol. What I believe to be the female was eyeing him pretty hard. Staying with 30 feet of us at times. Was pretty awesome experience all said and done. The hawks in our area all seem really healthy thanks to the bunnies lol. Also our large raven population. Smart birds.

"I’m non-military but I have lived in a number of places across the US. Here’s my thoughts:

- It’s an amazing place to live if you like being out in the nature. We have great weather about 350 days/year, and you can see as many ultra-prominent peaks from town as there are in the entire state of colorado. The wildlife diversity and abundance is mind-boggling, the trails are largely empty, and the climbing is world class. Amazing areas like Cochise Stronghold, Kartchner Caverns, and the Huachucas are either adjacent to town or a short drive away.

- The quality of the grocery stores in town is shockingly good given the size of the area and it’s remoteness. 

- If you are single and ready to mingle, you might have a hard time as night life is largely based on travel to Bisbee and Tucson. That said, there’s dozens of wineries and distillery’s just north of town. 

- There’s a significant number of talented artists, though many hold shows in neighboring Bisbee.

- Politically, Sierra Vista is purplish, though certainly surrounded by a sea of red (with Bisbee as a bright blue island).

- If you avoid the west end of town, things are generally peaceful and crime free. 

- Housing is outrageous at the moment. My wife and I would like to sell since our home value has nearly doubled in two years, but there’s nothing to buy. Even apartment rent has become expensive.

- The restaurants here are what you’d expect with a large retirement community - lots of inexpensive mediocre food with no shortage of chains. There are some gems, and SV is home to some of the best Korean and German food stateside. Bakers Dozen makes the best glazed donuts I’ve ever had, and the new Ramen shop is delicious. That said, expect to drive to Bisbee or Tucson when you really want a high end meal. Vegetarian food is fairly easy to come by, vegan much more difficult.

- The schools are typical AZ insanity. The lower education in this state, whether charter or not, is a coin flip from terrible to great. 

- There’s tons of communities and classes, from meditation to yoga to hiking and horse back riding. There’s even a community theatre that puts on shows and a community pottery studio. The library is nice, and Ramsey Canyon Preserve brings in incredible musicians for cheap shows.

- The people in SV are generally kind (there’s an over abundance of volunteers at the homeless and animal shelters!) but do tend to keep to themselves. Of course, random interactions can be unpleasant.

- There’s no downtown in SV, and though they’re hoping to change that it’s hard to see it happening anytime soon. It’s basically a sprawled out suburb with 75 miles of desert separating it from the nearest city.

- Good paying jobs can be hard to come by if you’re not with a military contractor. 

Overall, if you like being outside and living a slower pace of life, SV is a great place to be with lots of amenities for a town it’s size. I completely love it here and don’t plan on leaving anytime soon. That said, if you’re looking for big concerts or an active bar/club scene, it would be hard to recommend moving here.",t2_3o2cnevd,CrownOfAragorn,0,1634757487.0,0,t1_hhectrq,hhectrq,True,TheBuddhistTraveler,t3_qbqc5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/sierravista/comments/qbqc5l/best_and_worst_things_about_living_in_sierra_vista/,Best and worst things about living in Sierra Vista?,/r/sierravista/comments/qbqc5l/best_and_worst_things_about_living_in_sierra_vista/hhectrq/,6,r/sierravista,0,6

"Sierra Vista is one of those places where you either love it or hate it. I’ve been here for about 17 years and in my opinion it has grown a bit worse over the years.  

The absolute WORST thing about it here is the traffic, idk why people say it’s not bad here because it really is rough for a rural town.  Take me 15ish minutes to get to work and about 40 to get home.  People clog up both lanes on the major thoroughfares and go 5-15mph slower than posted at all times of the day.  If you have a Facebook account you should follow SVNN (Sierra vista news network) to see how many negligence-related accidents we have daily in this town.  IMO this stems from a lack of law enforcement presence on the roads.

Equally as bad but doesn’t affect me nearly as often is the brand new hospital here is pretty bad. They are a for-profit, private hospital that charges ridiculous rates and does not accept a lot of locally offered health insurance options.  Their senior leaders use religious bias as an excuse to circumvent medical science.  They will back-bill you without batting an eye.

The next worst thing is that we do not have the infrastructure to support the amount of consumers  shopping here. All 4 of the major grocery stores in the town are always packed, and there are always wait times to check out.  Other stores don’t usually have this issue which makes me believe we just don’t have enough grocery stores to support the needs of the community.

The public schools in the area are pretty bad.  Road conditions are also fairly bad in certain areas.

Illegal immigration and human/drug smuggling is a big concern.  My daughters school has gone on lockdown a few times this school year already because of it.

The last thing I’ll talk about on my negative list is that we don’t really have anything for the children to do here.  I moved here when I was 12 and luckily I lived on ft huachuca where there were multiple youth events held all the time, however not everyone can get on post so this shouldn’t be counted as a plus. Now that I have youngins of my own I’ve been struggling to find things to do with them that won’t cause dehydration or heat exhaustion during the summer.

Something awesome about SV is the sheer amount of outdoorsy things to do here. It’s the hummingbird watching capitol of the US, has hiking trails, vast areas for riding your utv/atv/dirt bike/whatever, has a few lakes within an hour’s drive away, and hunting. It also has some excellent restaurants such as the German Cafe (featured in the Arizona Highways magazine), tons of home style Korean (SV Home is my favorite), and 143 Street Taco is amazing.  There are also some really nice breweries close by, the Copper Brothel in Sonoita is freaking awesome. Close enough to Tucson to make day trips worth your while.  Fort Huachuca has a TON of high-paying jobs with the only real stipulation being that you need to get a security clearance, usually paid for by the employer.

Overall it isn’t terrible but there is a lot the city could do to improve.  I’ve been wanting to move away for a while but it has what I need in the meantime.",t2_6za4tun9,grillingnewb,0,1634754590.0,0,t1_hhe5l75,hhe5l75,True,TheBuddhistTraveler,t3_qbqc5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/sierravista/comments/qbqc5l/best_and_worst_things_about_living_in_sierra_vista/,Best and worst things about living in Sierra Vista?,/r/sierravista/comments/qbqc5l/best_and_worst_things_about_living_in_sierra_vista/hhe5l75/,1,r/sierravista,0,1

"To me there are only two types of places to eat. High end, when you 'know' the food is going to be good. Or one of those hole in the wall places, where you're even scared to walk in the door.

"I’m an Army brat, so I’ve lived all over. No offense to people that are from Arizona, because I heard the same thing prior to coming here about how good the food was.
For example, not sure if you’re a fan of Mexican food or not. But I’m a big fan, and majority of the places are mediocre at best. There just seems to be a lot of lack of flavor. Most of the food here is just “doable” but I wouldn’t say it’s good, if that makes sense. You‘ll notice it more with more common chain restaurants. For example, pizza hut. I’m not a huge pizza hut lover in general, but pizza is pizza and it’s pretty good. I’ve gotten it twice since I’ve been here, and both times it was either really over cooked and hard in the middle or something else wrong with it. Panda Express for example just doesn’t taste the same here as other places we’ve been. Olive Garden, another example. We love going there, mostly for their bread sticks. The location here always has them tasting kind of stale and harder.
To not sound too harsh, I’m not saying the food here sucks or tastes bad, it’s just very boring. Usually when you go out to eat you want something that’s really good, and a lot of places here are just very “ehh, it’s okay”.
The best way I can think to explain it. You know how certain areas just have less attractive people overall? Like the example of “oh she’s a 10 here, but she’d be a California 5.” That’s how I feel about here lol. There’s some places that I’m like “for here, it’s great. Overall, it’s ok.”

Note: This isn’t to say there aren’t some good spots out here, as there definitely are some places we enjoy. It seems that most of the people who talk about the good food here come from here, because most people I talk to that have traveled to here agree with me.

Hope I didn’t come off too negative as I think it looks that way. I just hope you have more of a realistic expectation before you think everything is just amazing lol.",t2_6gqg318x,CrossSectional,0,1634731618.0,0,t1_hhcohcn,hhcohcn,False,TheBuddhistTraveler,t3_qbqc5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/sierravista/comments/qbqc5l/best_and_worst_things_about_living_in_sierra_vista/,Best and worst things about living in Sierra Vista?,/r/sierravista/comments/qbqc5l/best_and_worst_things_about_living_in_sierra_vista/hhcohcn/,2,r/sierravista,0,2

"I don't live there, but I spent a few months there for an Army school and really enjoyed it.

So from that perspective, things I really liked:

* [143 Street Tacos](https://143streettacos.com/) and the Landmark Cafe
* It's got its own vibe, but is in striking distance to places with very different vibes (e.g. Tucson, Bisbee)
* Lots of outdoor activities also in striking distance
* People seemed generally friendly
* Wide streets and sidewalks in many of the neighborhoods with some nice public parks

The only thing I found a bit concerning (I wasn't there long, after all--I'm sure there is more) was the somewhat checkered record of environmental contamination and water usage conflicts from the military presence.

Edit: coming from the pacific northwest, it's also substantially more politically conservative than I am used to; not sure how it compares to the surrounding areas, but there is likely a conservative influence from the military retiree community, too.

"We love living here. Moved here last year during the pandemic. Husband is a contractor and his company needed him to start last May. It was hard at first because everything was shut down. Now that everything is open again, we have been to the Farmers Market, Wine Festival, Fourth of July Celebration, Movies in the Park, and are going to go to Art in the Park and Concerts in the Park in the fall. I’ve also heard there’s a fun fall festival in Patagonia in Oct, so we might try that as well. SV is a great little town with a strong community. Most people we’ve met are transplants and have moved here for border patrol, military, or are contractors like us. The one downside we’ve found though is housing. If you’re military, you probably won’t have as much trouble. We initially planned to rent but couldn’t find any rentals available, so we bought our house. Luckily, we were able to find an amazing neighborhood with lots of kids. Our experience in SV may have been very different if we weren’t in the neighborhood we are in.

"Something to keep in mind a swamp cooler functions by adding humidity to the air. So it will not work as well if the ambient humidity is already high.

All that being said it should be able to cool your house better than that.

Things to look for are the swamp cooler pads to calcified to actually provide Cooling?

Is the spider the plastic tubing on the top of the unit that's feeding water to these pads flowing?

Do you need a new pump? It may be clogged from calcium.

Is the belt on the motor head actually attached firmly and spinning when the unit is running?

"On a trip from here into New Mexico, my wife and I discovered birding was fun, and the SV area is far more rewarding as a birding spot.

There's an active geocaching community here, if you're outdoorsy and want to participate.

There are all sorts of ruins you can go see, like Fairbank between Whetstone and Tombstone, Charleston, which is north along the river from Charleston Road, Bruncknow (?) Cabin which is in the same area, and the old Spanish presidio, near Fairbank.

If you like Vietnamese food, there are plenty of options along Fry. We're not enormous fans, but we enjoyed the restaurants nonetheless.

Picnic at the Murray Springs Clovis site, which has some cool geologic and archeological background.

There's also apparently a new batting cage business open in the mall.

Go out to the range and shoot together.

"It honestly matters where you live.

I've lived here most of my life and didn't see any except when I was exploring out in the desert as a teenager. Moved away, came back and got a house near Town and Country and now I see them every year. Realtors call my area ""Scorpion Alley"" because is seems they are just in this area for some reason. Also yes, I've been stung in my sleep here, years ago. The area stung and tingled for a few hours and that was it. Started getting my house perimeter sprayed after that and haven't seen one in the house since.

So they honestly are not something to be afraid of, even if they are in your area and for sure nothing to keep yourself awake at night worrying about.",t2_78mqb,AZTricky,0,1620776249.0,0,t1_gxsjaee,gxsjaee,True,[deleted],t3_mxft8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/sierravista/comments/mxft8v/scorpions/,scorpions?,/r/sierravista/comments/mxft8v/scorpions/gxsjaee/,1,r/sierravista,0,1

"We came here with the military fine years ago.  Didn't expect to stick around after my tour, but we instantly feel in love with the place and decided to make it our ""forever home.""

We lived in Sierra Vista for a few years, but as soon as my retirement was approved, we bought a house in Hereford with some acreage.  We're about halfway between SV and Bisbee, raising chickens, living the country life, and loving it.

I've been trying to convince everyone I know to move here.  But, it's not for everyone.  It's not cosmopolitan by any stretch of the imagination.  And I imagine that growing up here wouldn't be much fun. There doesn't seem to be a lot for kids to do around here.  Mine are all grown up, though. So maybe I just don't have my on the pulse of area youth activities.

We're at a higher elevation than most of the surrounding area and, so are usually about 10 degrees cooler than, say, Tucson.  We get wild thunderstorms most summer afternoons.

I come from Los Angeles and then moved to Phoenix . but when i got stationed here about 2 yrs ago i fell in love with the town.

Its not a huge city like its in Tucson or Phoenix but its a small enough city to have a comfortable life. from what i hear, the locals tell me its a great quiet place that its very friendly.

I feel like if i grew up here from the start i would know everyone since its small enough.

It does have its share of homeless like every other town but DEF not as bad as cali to the point that SV has a ""tent city"".

"Hey! Fellow floridiot here, I've been in Sierra vista for about four years, about to move out of state. I wouldn't personally reccomend sv for a younger crowd and would point you towards Tucson definitely, but if you're looking for a quiet area I'd say sv is your bet. There's a few outlying areas such as hereford, whetstone, Huachuca City which are further removed from everything but the housing is even cheaper because of that. In Sierra vista actual I'd reccomend the north east or south east if you're looking for a nicer area. The center and west of the city is kinda crappy. I don't want to say crack town but it's a bit lower income.

"Lately it seems that once you get north of Hereford Rd, the less likely you are to have issues with illegal traffic. This of course is a generality and not a hard rule, and many properties closer to the border do not usually get traffic but rarely. 

There are plenty of several acre lots in the Southeast Sierra Vista/Hereford area that can accommodate horses.

I haven't had the experience of dating heavily here, but I guess I got lucky with my fiance.

"Yeah I find Tucson to be kinda weird in terms of crime areas... I guess I live in the bad part of town, but what’s weird is going .6 miles right from my place it is kinda crackhead central but if you go left .6 miles it’s pretty posh, nice houses, etc. 

There are some junkies that come around my apt complex (it’s actually a decent complex though so no clue why they gravitate there) but even as a petite 5’1 female I have a pretty tough seeming exterior. I’m a fricken teddy bear and honestly, not much of a fighter but I guess I play it off pretty well. There were some crackheads doing crackhead stuff and being loud at my complex a few nights ago and I just rocked up with my phone and asked if there was a problem and I could call the cops if they need help... they left real quick. I imagine your gf must be very uncomfortable when getting approached taking out the trash, that is scary, but I’m pretty sure tweakers are more scared of her than she is of them, all she needs to say is “police”... they’ll kick rocks. 

You wouldn’t get things like that happening in Sierra Vista, well I guess dependent on where you live, so that is a bonus about SV, but also, like 100% legit, if you’re bored and it’s too gross out to go hiking, your literal only option for fun is to go to super Walmart (which btw is fairly new... imagine what a big deal it was when we got a super Walmart.... it was a very big deal... that’s what SV is like.)

"It honestly depends on how quiet you like your quiet. I grew up in SV and as much as I complained about it while growing up I guess it had its good qualities too, but then I moved to a new state to a city the size of Tucson and got pretty spoiled by the fact that there was so much more to do (plus I’m a foodie so it was nice to have more options besides chains). 

I’m back in Arizona now but I just can’t do Sierra vista anymore so I live in Tucson. Yeah there’s crime here but it’s comparable to other state city I lived in and I don’t find it to be THAT bad... just ignore the junkies I guess.... but I also don’t spook easy from that kind of stuff. I’m aware of my surroundings and play it safe. 

Anyway, I go down to SV often to see my family/ friends... it is nice to get a reprieve from the traffic and noise but going out to eat sucks cause chains (although indochine is on point) and the hiking is alright but we have hiking in Tucson too. I guess it’s just your preference. If you don’t mind small town (and I do mean small town, like not even having a downtown kind of small town) life than SV can be ok I guess.

"Southern Arizona is one of the best places to star gaze. It's the reason why the University of Arizona has such an important astronomy program. In regards to Sierra Vista, you can see the stars extremely well with the blind eye since there's barely any light pollution.

"Yawn.  Trig is high school stuff.  I don't mean to brag, but I consolidate financial statements for a living.  I specialize in consolidation accounting.  I normally use the equity method, but that depends on where the company is based.  Us companies use gaap while companies everywhere else use international standards.  So it all depends.  Your high school math is flawed.  The distance using trig is closer to four feet.  Nice try though.  I am sure my math skills are on another level to your basic engineering math skills.

There are a lot of reasons: For one, in a lot of places there's no sidewalk at all, or they have vertical curbs. It's also dangerous at intersections, because cars aren't watching for bikes flying into the road from there.

"While I've never honked or screamed or did anything childish towards you cyclist folks, I've got to say I get the frustration.

If we're being honest, Ft. Huachuca isn't optimized for cyclists(at all). Not your fault, I know. Thing is, no one is leisurely driving on post at that time or anytime for that matter. People are trying to get to PT or work or wherever, and I'm assuming you're getting the hate because you're slowing them down. 

Imagine you were on a bike path designed with bikes in mind but there were people walking on it and you had to keep slowing down and waiting until you could get around them. Chances are you would get pretty frustrated.

"I would stick with the normal dealerships that are certified by the manufacturers.  The farther away from the main gate you can get, the better.  I honestly would prefer, and this is a personal opinion, to shop for a car in Tucson.  There's more variety there.  It seems Sierra Vista has mostly like GM, Ford, and a Honda Dealership.  So you have some selection there, but you'd have a better one in Tucson.  That's just a personal opinion from an old Soldier who drives a Kia.

Drinking is one of my favorite activities, too, and when I get back there from the holidays, I'll invite you over for a drink!  I live in the Oasis Apartments, off Busby Drive.  The mountains around Sierra Vista are a lot more beautiful than I originally thought when I first moved there.  Lots of scenic views, etc.  If anyone tells you you're going to run into illegals attempting to cross the border, ignore them.  I have never run into any other human beings on the trails other than hikers.  Do, however, bring some rattlesnake anti-venom and a knife or gun or something to protect yourself from wildlife.  I have run into rattlesnakes and havelina pigs quite often up there.  The havelinas can be quite aggressive, FYI.

The town culture is what you'd expect from a military town.  It's populated with contractors and retired and current active duty military, as well as those who support the base and the industry around it.  It's patriotic, and has a very home-town feel to it, if that's what you're into.  There are lots of good escapes around the city, as well.  Bisbee is a pretty neat little town, and is worth exploring for a day, same as Tombstone (a large tourist attraction, but worth at least one visit).  Ft. Huachuca is a training installation, so there's a high turnover rate of personnel entering and leaving the fort.  If you're like me and stationed there, getting a lease longer than six months is worth it.  Usually, renters will give you some sort of incentive for staying longer than six months, like discounted overall rent, or an upgraded apartment for the same price.  I got a three-bedroom split level for the price of the two bedroom because I signed a year lease instead.  Just another FYI I forgot to mention earlier.
The main strip of the city is Fry Boulevard, and it is largely populated with what you expect, car dealerships, bars, tattoo parlors, etc.  Get off the main drag, and you'll find a comic book shop, a bunch of really good Mexican restaurants, and some other really neat mom-and-pop shops.  
There's also the new Wal-Mart that was built a few years ago, a Panda Express, etc.  It's not a bad place to be, really, and the weather is quite pleasant compared to where I came from in Northeast Kansas. :)",t2_7plod,kareed3,0,1418002640.0,0,t1_cmob91n,cmob91n,False,[deleted],t3_2ojn9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/sierravista/comments/2ojn9l/im_moving_to_sierra_vista_on_the_26th_and_need/,I'm moving to Sierra Vista on the 26th and need some help!,/r/sierravista/comments/2ojn9l/im_moving_to_sierra_vista_on_the_26th_and_need/cmob91n/,1,r/sierravista,0,1

"1.) There are several local dealerships to buy vehicles at.  Stay away from the other used car lots, they usually make their money preying on junior enlisted soldiers.  If you don't like the selection in town, go to Tucson.

2.)  Mild weather, right now.  The town is a big military town, so you're in for a lot of places to get a drink, a shitty mall, Best Buy, and lots of mountains to hike in (if that's your thing).  Otherwise, not too much, really...and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  If you have Verizon, you'll enjoy the great service down there.  If you have AT&T, your service will be great depending on where you are in town.  Anyone else...good luck.  Cable and Internet provider is Cox.  There are rumors of a few more, but I've never seen them on my end of town.  
3.)  I don't know how the schools are.  My six-year-old is going to school in KC, so I don't have any first-hand knowledge on that one.  Sorry.  If you have any more questions, you can reply or PM me, or whatever.

Bisbee is live music on the weekends so I go there often. No comedy clubs that I know of. Hiking and mountain biking is awsome. There isn't much to do if u enjoy the night life clubs and lounges. I dont love living here but I dont hate it either. Better paying jobs are on post.  There's a place called Jr's and pauls pub u can go hang out. Ive been there a few times. Saw the exact same drunk people and army guys looking for fight. Summit fitness is a good place to work out. There's an mma spot in town but never checked it out. ,t2_by2kg,MOTOcityRider,0,1408490471.0,0,t1_cjv1fxq,cjv1fxq,True,[deleted],t3_2dudvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sierravista/comments/2dudvk/looking_to_move_to_sv/,Looking to move to SV,/r/sierravista/comments/2dudvk/looking_to_move_to_sv/cjv1fxq/,2,r/sierravista,0,2

"The closest comedy club is Laffs in Tucson, but there are open mic nights around the county that feature stand-up. If you're good, maybe you can do openers for some of the local music shows. We've got at least two decent venues, hopefully more to come. 

If you line up a job before you make the move down here, you'll find it quite an amenable place to live. Let me know if you want any help looking for places to live. There are tons of apt complexes, mobile home parks, rentals, etc. But there are definitely a few that you should avoid at all costs.

I'm a desert girl, so the idea of living in MA horrifies me more deeply than I can describe. We've not had a single snowflake all season, and that's the way uh-huh-uh-huh I like it. :)

There are some really great people here, the local music scene is pretty rad, and there are tons of locally owned businesses (esp in Bisbee) that are one-of-a-kind. Also, the weather is wonderful. We've had the most wonderfully mild winter I can remember. The downside is that the next summer is likely going to be murderously hot, but oh well, that's why we have AC in every building.
