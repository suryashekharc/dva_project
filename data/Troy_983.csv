"A couple of thoughts:

\-I'd like to see a more aggressive adoption of [form-based code](https://formbasedcodes.org/) to increase supply of potential small commercial spaces and hopefully lower the cost.

\-ADU (accessory dwelling unit) development spreads affordable housing throughout the city and doesn't involve big handouts to developers. It's great that there is an allowance for these in the new code, but it really should be more robust to mean anything.

\-It's great to get rid of some parking requirements for small landlords and some businesses and we should move away from our dependence on automobiles, but getting rid of parking requirements without corresponding actions to decrease our reliance on cars is a recipe for disaster. We need more pedestrian and bike-friendly neighborhoods and business climate to flank this problem from the demand side as well as the supply side.

"I was living in the collar factory from July of last year to November.

I've rented two apartments (in houses) in the hill neighborhood between hoosick and People's ave. It's walking distance to RPI and rents are more reasonable (and more square footage) than the downtown area. I really like it. The neighborhood is pretty quiet. It's a lot of students mixed with some community members (I'm not a student). You'll see a lot of units advertised in late spring/ summer as students graduate. One word of caution many buildings in Troy are very old so it depends on the landlord how well they are maintained.

"Prices are definitely rising in central/downtown Troy but I’d recommend south Troy, finding a roommate, or somewhere on the hill off of Congress. Last summer while I was looking to move, there were a lot of town houses for relatively cheap.

For example, I lived with two roommates in a 4 bedroom for 3 years, and the total rent was $1120.

All of these areas are deemed “bad” often, but having lived in South Troy for 3 years, nothing “bad” will happen to you if you don’t go looking for it.

"Your response (and /u/MizBusyBody's and /u/Noqa's) has me thinking this might be an issue of terminology. And I'm not from the capital region originally, so maybe this is a raspberry mozzarella stick thing that I'm not going to get.

But in my mind ""fish fry"" refers, almost exclusively, to the giant fish stick sandwich Ted's serves. The stuff Ale House or Olde English would sell, the ""real filet pieces"", would be fish and chips.

Obviously being a fried seafood dish there is significant similarity. But I expect looking for ""fish fry"" is going to be a never ending loop to Ted's, while looking for ""fish and chips"" is going to yield more diverse and higher quality results.

"I can get the exact count of each  -to the best of my ability -if you're really interested.

In my time in this particular residence, there have been 2 successful stabbings in the Dunkin lot, several police calls for people wielding knives, 2 stabbings occurring at the Corner Store, and at least 2 in Barker Park. So, that's what, a 300' radius? Again, this is from memory so I'll have to go back to my records, but I know I'm very, very close.

At what # does crime become 'common' to you? This crime is so concentrated, that in my mind, it constitutes 'common'. 

Here's what I suggest: Do your own due diligence. Go on Twitter, and do an advanced search for posts by @copwatch12180, and use key words like: Congress, Dunkin, Barker, Knife, stab, gun, etc. I think you'll be pretty shocked. Keep in mind that that's only a fraction of actual occurrences. Similarly, just Google 'Dunkin stabbing Troy'. I know that will yield results, too.



I know nothing of BDSM knife play, but we learn something every day. Thanks.

"There is no reason any one should have to deal with the chance of being stabbed as a reality. 

That being said, dude you oscillate between saying things like you are tired of waking up to another crime scene and knife play is ""pretty common"" to  saying that there has been 4 stabbings in 5 years. That's not common. You also state in the OP while talking about everything that has happened in the past year that there has been 3 stabbings in that lot. Which is more that what you just cited for the past 5 years..

And I'll say right off the bat before you do, I am sure there have been more. But you're citing 4 as the number that would make it common.

"I believe a lot of people reflexively defend the institution of policing because they fear an alternative they and quite frankly, few people have conceptualized and assume that the alternative to armed, armored police is quite literally nothing, resulting in fantastical ideas of lawlessness reigning. Public safety is paramount to a civil society, but it should be fairly clear to anyone willing to consider what policing currently looks like is wholly inadequate. Troy PD eats a quarter of the entire city's budget to maintain policing per citizen levels on par with the city of Los Angeles to effectively serve as armed bureaucrats who operate reflexively, shrug and take reports at crime scenes to file statistics with the FBI, and make arrests if they're warranted. But yet everyone here clearly sees that shootings, stabbings, largely interpersonal violent crime, but violent crime nonetheless continue unabated in the most expensive and rapidly gentrifying part of the city, in the face of Troy PD receiving special budgetary expenditures and increases for equipment and hiring new officers every year, without fail. Having additional officers on this block will just push the individuals elsewhere, probably down here to continually neglected South Troy. Plain clothes officers aren't exactly subtle, which will result in more of the same, not preventing crime, but shifting where it occurs geographically.

I'll say it again-- public safety is paramount for a civil society. There is space in the functioning of society for a ""public safety officer"". But continuing to hold the police responsible for solving problems they did not create and cannot fix (which the ex-chief made clear, repeatedly, over the years) will not result in anything changing, unless you are willing to arrest and incarcerate the entire population. Unless we are willing to reconsider how to tackle these problems from a social and economic perspective, and are willing to wholesale reevaluate what we criminalize as a society, OP will continue to witness violence in our city, and if it's not in the Dunkin' Donuts parking lot, it will be on my block, or your street, our alleys, the parks.

"So when he was catnapped, Gina had let him out because he's a bossy boy and then she fell asleep accidentally. He's a very handsome cat and apparently a man and a woman snatched him up wrapping him in a t-shirt so he couldn't get away. A neighbor on 2nd Street noticed and recognized him. The neighbor tried to follow them but lost them in the crowd at bootleggers. When we got the signs and started putting the word out, a bootlegger regular confirmed that he saw the couple with the cat.

We had a description of them because the woman had a very distinctive hairstyle so everybody was on high alert. The next night some other Troy redditors spotted the same couple and follow them to their place on 4th Street. I tracked on the landlord because they had security cameras. The landlord's property manager was going through the footage with me when a guy who fit the description started chit chatting. After casually mentioning that Gina was beside herself with grief and had filed the police report and was going to press charges if she was able to catch the catnappers, this fellow suggested checking an empty apartment and the back hall. Low and behold Umberto was in the back hall. We got him home. 

Obviously we did not use the cops because it worked out and he was safe and unharmed. The message to not mess with people's pets got through loud and clear. If one tiny piece of fur on that cat had been hurt though....

If you live downtown please say hi to Umberto and Gina. She's super sweet, has had a really fascinating life but kind of needs people to watch her back. That's what we do for our older neighbors. If you see Umberto prancing around without Gina scoot his ass back to the house. She knows she's not supposed to let him out without a leash without supervision but he bosses her around.

"A large problem is this: Hoosick Street and NY Route 7 are the main connection between Southwest Vermont and the rest of the world. That road sees something in the area of 30,000 vehicles/day and half them of them are bound for somewhere beyond Brunswick. It is by far the busiest surface road in the Capital District and among the busiest north of NYC. A road diet with nothing else will just make the problem spill onto surrounding streets and communities more than it already does. Because again, remember: much of this is thru traffic. 

Once upon a time, that corridor *was* supposed to get a freeway. It would have taken out most of the Hoosick Street corridor, but there was supposed to be something.

"The great thing is that we will have TWO non-profit groceries near each other just like suburbs have giant corporate grocery stores across the street from each other. It means OPTIONS. I know several Trojans who have traveled to Utica to check out Bargain Grocery firsthand and were really impressed. They said it's like a Trader Joes/Aldi, with store brands and good prices. 

Capital Roots director said at (Dec?/Nov?) Planning she is not planning on having some normal grocery store things like toilet paper since they are focused more on perishables. For whatever reason, the Cap Roots director was hostile (at the planning meeting) to the idea of any other food providers in the neighborhood--IDK why, we certainly are worthy of have many options just like suburbanites and both stores would serve a rapidly growing downtown population. Both are on bus routes and bike paths, so car free shopping is going to be much easier.  


I did attend the planning meeting and the project actually does comply with City Code so I'm not sure where that misinfo is coming from... It's reactivating an empty building in North Central, a neighborhood that needs more economic investment and services. There is also Senior Affordable Housing being built across the street so that means older people will be close to both grocery stores.

"If the federal  infrastructure bill doesn't get passed as an outside source of funding, I'd still want to invest in infrastructure. Specifically water/sewer. The majority of that infrastructure is from the 19th century. If we could get it replaced, then it would stop the sinkholes that destroy road repairs. Also our biggest risk of flooding is from rain microburst. Stormwater management helps flood risk parts of Troy avoid damage. 

Trash, recycling, street repair vehicles and building some new sheds to protect that investment from the elements is also pragmatic though not that exciting.

The budget is developed by the mayor's office so it's worth reaching out to the executive branch if you think community input at the planning level would be effective. There is opportunity for public comment when it goes to the city council like any policy.

Personally, a property tax cut or freeze would be great and make my life better. But that requires increasing city revenue to keep pace with inflation. Weed sales tax is going to open up a whole new income stream.

"I mean, why doesn’t **any** business charge less than they do for the products they sell? For better or worse, that’s the market: you charge the price you can sell for (or whatever reduced price yields equivalent benefits, e.g. zoning exemptions, tax deductions, etc.).

I would say the answer to this problem might be publicly-owned housing but it seems like that might raise the same “quality of life” objections from “most” that subsidized housing evidently does.",t2_7n9uv,jletourneau,0,1643647493.0,0,t1_hv0g2yb,hv0g2yb,False,rs_joe,t3_sggrbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Troy/comments/sggrbo/apartments_with_a_view_a_view_of_a_salt_pile/,Apartments with a view!

"I appreciate your pedantry. Truly.

Labels have connotations, and subsidized housing doesn't enjoy a positive view from most, whether folks admit it or not. I suppose my point is, what if you just make housing affordable but not explicitly label and market it as such?

As a game, name one subsidized housing complex in Troy that is both truly mixed-income and does not suffer from quality of life issues.
