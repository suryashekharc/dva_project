Hello! I highly recommend the skating rinks at Crimson Ridge or downtown at the library. Finn hill is great for sledding along with Garsons hill. Searchmont (about an hour drive) is great for downhill skiing. We also have Hiawatha that has trails and cross country skiing if you are interested and it’s also great in the summer. The Ermatinger Clergue House is pretty neat to check out too. Pointe des Chenes beach and Gros Cap are nice scenic areas as well. The Spruce Haven Zoo is cool to check out although I’m not sure what’s going on with covid. Also if you are ever in need of a babysitter PM me! I have worked at the YMCA with kids for 5+ years! Which reminds me the John Rhodes and YMCA have gymnastics and swimming lessons if you are interested.

Ottawa has had this technology for over a decade now.  This is great for Sault Ste. Marie.  It's one of those things that once you use it you can never imagine going back without it.  I can remember growing up in Sault Ste. Marie and standing in the cold at a bus stop for an hour and then sit on the bus for 30-60 minutes.  Just to go 5km or so.  I ended up walking everywhere.  This app would make things a lot more efficient for anyone who uses public transportation in Sault Ste. Marie.

"It makes me sad that this man's life was drastically changed because he supported something that he fundamentally believed in. He did not know that this would go the way it did when he made that donation. He, like us, is probably a good upstanding Canadian that intended to support a cause that he thought would make our country better. He does not deserve to be vilified for doing what he thought at the time, was the right thing. Reading the comments here and elsewhere that make the supporters out to be horrible people sickens me. The self-righteousness is disgusting. and I fully expect that I will be called a racist and a nazi for my comments here. That will not, however, change the truth of what I am saying. 

Whether I agree or disagree with the protestors is not at issue here. I am making this statement for the protection of freedom. The protestors have a right to protest, I agree that they disrupted the city and created an uncomfortable situation, but in reality, that's all it was, an uncomfortable situation. 

There are business owners that stayed open during the occupation and served coffee and snacks to the protestors. The Ottawa police are now trying to arrest them for their participation. The argument in the House of Commons was that businesses were disrupted. These people found a way to continue through it all, and are now looking at having to defend themselves in court.

Another Ottawa business, a gelato shop, had both her locations vandalized after her name was published as a donor.  Disagreeing with the protest is ok, but breaking the law to voice your disapproval is not, the same as disagreeing with the government by blocking roads is not ok. In reality, both opinions are guilty of the same crime.

As for me, I will stand by those that supported the protest. They had a right and a duty to their conscience to do what they thought was right. Erring on the side of freedom is safer than allowing our Country to fail because we weren't paying attention to the slow and steady decline of democracy.

"Hopefully I can give some context to this:

We only ever had affordable housing wording in our bylaws because we anticipated the provincial government (think it was the Harris government, but I could be wrong) to have municipalities do just that. Things got messy when that never came to pass and so we as a city had to either waive those affordable housing units or make the developers include them which isn’t standard elsewhere in the province. This would open us up for LPAT challenges.

We’re in the process of updating our official plan which will hopefully rectify this situation in the future.

"This time of year is notoriously bad for home-buying. Inventory is WAY down, and we are seeing a lot of pressure from out of town buyers with extra money from a home sale in a more expensive market willing to overpay locally. There were fewer units sold in Dec. 2021 than in Dec. 2020.

Hopefully in the springtime there will be more inventory and prices will soften, there was a brief moment earlier this year when that was the case. 

I moved here in 2016 and prices were a lot lower, but at the time they were among some of the lowest in the country. It's not entirely surprising that we've seen pricing come up to be more in line with other markets. That doesn't mean $50K over asking is reasonable, it's just something we are dealing with as demand exceeds supply.

Average house price in Sault Ste. Marie last year was $268,797 which is up 29% from 2020 and above the provincial increase of 22% year over year.

Average prices in the Sault are still below Sudbury, Thunder Bay, North Bay just slightly higher than Timmins. All of those markets are seeing similar increases in pricing.

You \*might\* still be able to afford a house in this market on a salary of $50K with a sizeable down payment and low monthly variable expenses, but it's probably not feasible for most.

Average household income in the 2015 Census (now 7 years old) was $76K, Median Household Income was $82K. That's makes home ownership in the Sault still within reach for many and that income data is old. People are making more money now than they were 7 years ago, but inflation is also a big factor!

Anyways, try not to panic. The answer isn't actually more taxes, it's more inventory, because older people are staying in their homes longer and we aren't building a lot of new homes right now due to inflated material costs.

"Only way to fix this is a tax on people own multiple properties. Make it less attractive to be a landlord the more properties you own. The first extra property could have a low tax or no tax so that people can still try and accumulate passive income. Each extra property the tax would increase. If a corporation owns a property start with a high tax, otherwise corporations will just spin off shell companies to own more properties and pay less tax.

If owning too many properties is not profitable then corporations and huge landlords will have to sell extra properties which should start to flood the market with places for sale and drop the prices significantly.

The problem is politicians (of any party) don't normally tax the rich because those are the people donating to their campaigns. Also, you can't introduce a tax that would make a company or person lose money on something that was profitable before, you have to phase it in.",t2_mvz9z,PeaTearGriphon,0,1642514040.0,0,t1_ht6cmuv,ht6cmuv,True,OutrageousMix5145,t3_s6mjf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaultSteMarie/comments/s6mjf5/the_housing_market_is_getting_out_of_control/,The housing market is getting out of control,/r/SaultSteMarie/comments/s6mjf5/the_housing_market_is_getting_out_of_control/ht6cmuv/,6,r/SaultSteMarie,0,6

"Our city has been closing the small schools for  large 'super schools' in the last 10-20 years so there's not really any 'good' or 'bad' schools so much as there used to be. I don't have children so I'm not the best source for that. My sister's kids went to Queen E (public) though, but every elementary and high school (catholic) my sister and I attended have since closed. 

If you're looking for houses with land then you're not going to be getting into any of the 'bad' parts of town. Those areas (Steeltown, Jamestown, Downtown) aren't even *that* bad if you avoid certain streets at night. The further from the steel plant the better. 

Our city has a theft problem due to the opioid crisis and catch-and-release but lock up your stuff and you shouldn't have an issue. As a gas tech you'll likely find a job easily. I'd recommend applying at the steel plant as they're definitely going to need as many skilled peeps as they can get when the modernization is complete. If not the plant then there's Praxair, Enbridge/Union Gas, Tenaris, Arauco, etc.

"Not sure why you got it in your thick head that I said there isn't a problem in town, as I've many times stated there is. I have also stated many times that it is getting worse. *As it is everywhere.* 

You seem to think that just because you haven't heard of something, means it doesn't exist. I don't give a fuck what you have or haven't heard from whomever you know here, our city has recently started to address the issue as the pandemic magnified and compounded it. They had no choice but to.

"Someone asked how IT work and safety was there. Y'all you are clearly in the btter parts of the soo apparently think its sunshine and roses there and telling people it is. 

Its not. 

I work in IT, last time i lived there I wasn't getting so much as a callback for interview for positions applied, until my ex'es mother put in a word for me and suddenly opportunities came in.  I moved to Quebec, don't speak french and have a job that pays better than anything there based on merit , not who i know. 

The opiod crisis is worse than what ive stated here, you pretending it isnt is how come its gotten so bad. The policy there is to arrest away the povery and problem. I go home for a visit every summer and its getting worse and worse every year.

Whats being done about the problem? Last i checked the 10 million dollar plaza wont fix it, arresting poverty wont fix it. You have had the same status quo city council for over a decade running it into the ground.

Hell , last election was neck and neck between the status quo and the soo's new italian poster boy who literally did not know how basic laws were passed. Why would someone so incompetent even be considered? Becuse they rep the community.

"No it isn’t! 🙄 When you move you’ll find 4 distinct areas of the city - West End, East End, Top of the Hill/P Patch and Downtown. Those who live in the East End tend to be pretty snobby about every other area of the city. (I can say that ‘cause although I just got here, I was born here & grew up in the East End)

I live literally 5 houses down from Henrietta. I just moved here Mid-Oct & my neighbours are INCREDIBLE. My dog got out under my fence & I was frantic looking for him. I have chronic pain & need a scooter to get around. As I passed a neighbour calling for my dog, he asked what was wrong & I explained and asked him to keep an eye out. As I came back down towards my home, about 4 other neighbours who’d heard me calling had asked what was wrong & said they’d look out for him. By the time I got back to my driveway? A woman came by & said “Heard you lost your dog?” She asked which way I’d gone to search & then went in the other direction (toward Henrietta 😐). My scooter battery was dying so I stayed near my driveway & got in touch with my sister to come help me. While waiting for her I thought “Maybe that lady was just being polite…I should go check that street…” I got to my corner & in the distance I could see my neighbour walking towards me. As my eyes focused, I could see she had a furry, brown appendage. She’d gone FOUR BLOCKS, but she tracked down my baby for me!! 
When she gave him to me, I cried & then she started to cry. She says she doesn’t have dogs anymore, but all the dogs on the street get to know her cause she keeps treats for them. OH & her husband was the first person I ran into. He told her I lost my dog & she rushed out immediately to help me.
A few nights later we had a power failure at about 10pm that lasted a while. I got a knock on my front door & there was my neighbour - holding candles & an LED Light. She remembered that I’d just moved in and didn’t know if I’d had a chance to find my emergency supplies and wanted to be sure I had some lights.
When we had a big snow a couple weeks ago, I wasn’t prepared. I’d just bought a car & had no snow brush or shovel. I wound up using my cane to clean snow off the car & just rammed outta my drive. I came home about 2 hours later…and the Magical Snowplow Fairy had visited while I was out!! My drive was completely cleared all the way to my front door. I don’t know for sure who did it, but am so grateful they did!
My sister lives about 20 houses away, so also close to Henrietta. Her neighbour shows up with a genetti cake every couple of weeks. 
As to noise? Nope. One night some kids were out riding around having fun so it was noisy for 5 mins. But I’m CLOSE to the plant & rails and hear almost nothing. And my windows need replaced - they aren’t fancy, energy efficient, double paned gadgets, lol. The noise from road by my condo was way worse in S Ontario.
So yeah, that’s the kind of ‘bad’ neighbourhood it is here.

"I just moved up mid-Oct. I wound up buying a house, but was orig looking at apartments to begin. Just to let you know, this building on Cooper -https://www.williamsandmcdaniel.com/apartments/cooper-terrace-apts is a new acquisition of Williams & MacDaniel. As tenants move out, they are updating them. I saw pics of a pre-reno 1 bdrm and a renovated bach. I thought it was a pretty decent update. (Pics aren’t on the website, property mgr sent them to me, so wanted to pass on info) 
I found I was most successful by calling property management agencies as they hold most of the bigger buildings. And nice bldgs don’t need to advertise on Kijiji or classifieds, so getting in touch directly is often best way to find them.

"My original plan was different than my final plan (Just bought a little house & moved up mid-Oct) and I was looking into short term housing. I found it difficult. In fact, I lived in a hotel in S Ontario for 3 months before I got here.
One thing I will say when looking for rentals in general? Call & speak with Large Property Management Agencies. They tend to own the larger, better kept buildings. They also don’t need to advertise, so you won’t see them on SooToday or Kijiji or other places you may be looking. Some were willing to at least write a shorter than average lease. You may get a 6 or 9 month & after that be able to go month-to-month. If you need to leave while still under lease, I’m sure you know then you’d need to find a sublet or pay the rent…
Some companies I called - Williams & MacDaniel, Skyline Living, Property One, Elstrong. 
And there is one absolutely incredible short term building I know of. There are only 6-7 units, so actually finding availability is kinda like winning the lottery, lol.

"I saw this when you first posted it and I have been thinking. I moved here from Waterloo back in 2020. I remember in the 90s that they said Kitchener was nothing more than a dead industrial town. People ridiculed the town and they said it had problems that couldn’t be fixed and that no one should live there. Today in Kitchener most homes are worth over $1 million and there is a lot of $5 million homes in that area. 

Sault Ste. Marie has its problems. People call it a dead and industrial town. However, these problems don’t define the city, you’ve seen some posts on here and some people have had some bad experiences. Some people love this area. 

What I will tell you is that essentially you have the same problem that you will have anywhere. Some people are just stuck in a mindset that says they cannot succeed and they cannot make things happen. Others know that they can make things happen and they can succeed. Both of them are right and they have written their own futures.

This city has a lot of potential but you have to be willing to go after it.

You’re gonna be just fine. The rough areas are Jamestown, Albert and gore, and for some reason the east end thinks it’s better than the West End, But I haven’t been able to figure out why. It’s probably because it’s just close to the steel mill and people don’t like the smell.

I have noticed that there are a couple of families whose name is keep popping up in positions of power and prestige. But I can’t quite put my finger on it yet, or whether this is even a problem ( to me it seems like this city has cliques)

If you like Italian food you’re in luck.

Not sure what else to tell you, I am of the mindset that you can move anywhere and make things work out. You’re taking a chance, you’re doing likely doing this for the right reasons.  I really hope everything works out fine for you.

I'm not really sure what to say about your comment about the movies. I haven't seen that movie. There was, however, a near ebola outbreak in the states several years back, and if you think this is a crackdown, then research that a bit.

A hospital, where there are TONS of immunocompromised people on a regular basis, is precisely the place to get rid of staff who could bring a deadly disease into their workplace.

"I’m giving my opinion, stand up for the town if you’d like, give your opinion too I don’t mind. But if someone asks I’m going to give them my opinion on the town. 

When I first moved up here I was living in residence, within 3 months 15 cars were broken into and had valuables stolen… 15! And I hate to break it to you they weren’t all unlocked, many of them sustained damage, now you’d think this would be an area of concern when 15 people called the soo police to complain… they’re reaction was “sorry we’re dealing with other more serious crime” now you could say that they’re short staffed and that may be true, but still not even one cruiser for the 15 people who needed to have police reports written. 

Another thing; in the past month I’ve called in to report 3 unconscious people on sidewalks, beside buildings etc. the last time I called, the operator literally said “ugh… We were just down there”. I’m not even out of the house THAT much… and I managed to see 3. Idk doesn’t seem normal to me. 

I recall seeing a post earlier this year from one of the local news outlets, city council had early access to the newly corrugated yearly crime statistics reports for the last year; 2020. They were scared to have them released in fear that it would negatively impact tourism… seems like a valid concern, crime is up! 

Now thankfully for the first year in many crime did fall slightly for the year of 2021, I’ll be honest when there is some promising change, but crime rates are a highly dynamic statistic, meaning that the average is what signifies change, not a single value. I truly hope it continues for the downtrend. 

This town is plagued by problems and those who pretend that there is nothing wrong are just as bad as the politicians who withhold funding and refuse to advocate for addiction treatment.

Get offended if you want but this was never a ”normal” sight in the town I was raised in. I’m being honest.

"You've only made 2 posts on reddit, both complaining about the soo. 

I've been living here most of my life, never been broken into. I've known two people who've had their houses broken into in the past 30 years, both of which were drug dealers. I won't say it never happens, but totally random break ins? I've got to think they're extremely rare. It's almost always because they let the wrong type of person into their house.
I lock my doors, but I don't worry about my house being broken into at all.     
The worst thing I had to deal with was people stealing coins from my cupholder on an old truck I had that didn't lock. I just didn't leave any valuables in it and it was fine. My new truck locks, 0 issues since

I spent a few years living in downtown Ottawa, Sandy Hill, which was a nice neighbourhood. The visible drug problem and crime in general there was far, far worse than I see in 90% off the soo.

I travel to every part of the city for my job, and I never feel unsafe, even in the ""bad"" areas. I read some of the people complaining and I have to shake my head and wonder what reality they're living in.

"What age range on your kids? I take my toddler to gymnastics as well as parent and child swims at the John Rhodes. In the non snow months we go to Bellevue Park a lot. In the snow months I tow them around on a sled on Whitefish Island.

There are plenty of martial arts clubs in town. Pinder's Family Martial Arts Centre is particularly good as a traditional martial arts school, especially for kids. Steel City is good for mixed martial arts.

If your kids are teenagers and into board games, card games or tabletop games then there is usually something going on at the Games Nook.

As to break ins, I have lived here a long time and never been broken into... but I keep my doors locked now whereas I wouldn't have 10 years ago. I know people that have been broken into but it is usually crime-of-opportunity wherein something was unlocked or un monitored.

"Hey Everyone! I've just gotten the news that I'll be transferring to Sault Ste Marie from Barrie for work and now I get to plan all the fun stuff with only a bit of time. First thing is we need to secure an apartment but can't actually go see it first so any suggestions in that department would be awesome - I saw in this thread that Skyline Apartments are a good start? The plan is to buy so it would hopefully only be a year tenancy max.

Also, my fiance is an Educational Assistant in an Elementary school here and he's hoping to do the same thing there. Any input on that field and where to start would be super helpful!

We have been to there before and I have lived in Newfoundland so I'm fully prepared for the wild amount of snow but any other must know info would be helpful! We're mid-30s and literally know no one up there so... yeah! Haha

How hard is it to rent a place that allows pets? Are there possibilities of someone taking a down payment on a home and rent it to us for a year to pass the bank required 3-6 months after a career change and we purchase it through the bank after that year? Moving less would be fantastic.

"G Exam Route in Sault Saint Marie (October 4th 2021)

Upon leaving the drive test centre, turn right on to Trunk Road. 
Turn right on to Lake Street. Turn left on to Wellington. 
3 point turn, emergency stop and parallel parking were done in the neighborhood south of Wellington between Lake & Shannon. 

Proceeded straight ahead on to Bennett’s boulevard then took a left turn onto boundary road. Proceeded north towards Trans Canada Highway.

Took a right onto the Trans Canada Highway and proceeded east. Went to the highway and did the turn around proceeded along the Trans Canada Highway to Trunk Road and back to the Drive Test Centre.

\- Quattro (in the quattro hotel but has very good food)  
\- Georgies Shawarma for Lunch if its during the week  
\- East Street Pizza Company for Lunch  
\- North 82 for a more relaxed dinner although still upscale  
\- Fratellis or Giovannis for Dinner  
\- The pub at the watertower or Caseys for something that is a bit more family friendly.

As for a place to stay, I would recommend the Delta. It's right on the water. My parents stay there whenever they come to visit and they love it. Other places you may wanna check out are Robertson Cliffs, Gros Cap, The Pictographs (although that's about an hour north of the city).

"For personal experiences, I can't speak as a parent, but I can speak as a student. I was homeschooled for eighth grade due to a combination of issues, and I loved every second of it. My grades improved and when I got to high school I already knew a solid third of what was being taught. I'd exchange letters with my teacher down in Toronto and could learn at my own pace. My parents used the Independent Learning Centre (though this was way back in the days of Ye Olde Snail Maile) and I got booklets full of lessons and assignments to fill out. I had certain deadlines to meet on each booklet, and then I'd get another letter from my teacher full of feedback on what I did right and wrong. At the end of the year I got a 100% official report card, that I was fully able to use to get into the high school program I wanted. On the other hand I did miss out on the social aspect and didn't really know how to talk to my peers when I got back to them (thought that might've just been Awkward Teenager-itis). The friends I did have in grade seven obviously drifted when I wasn't around, and I don't have any pictures of a Grade Eight Trip to shove in a photo album and forget about for ten years.  


Obviously this is way out of date, it's probably all done online now, which might be an issue if your son doesn't like computers.

"I'm asking about removing him from school altogether. Sending a letter of intent to ADSB that I'm unenrolling him from school. 

He's almost 9, has HF Autism and school has always been a struggle. The last year I taught him at home (not online, because he hates sitting at the computer) due to covid and some vulnerable members of our family. He did really well having the one on one instruction and less formal/rigid style of learning. So far this year it's been a lot of stress, crying, acting out, etc since being back in the classroom. Now he's also complaining that other kids are bullying him.  

I was just wondering about others experiences. Thank you for responding. :)",t2_7jy93,Kidda_Boh,0,1631704737.0,0,t1_hcxr1fw,hcxr1fw,False,[deleted],t3_pn1dd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaultSteMarie/comments/pn1dd2/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/SaultSteMarie/comments/pn1dd2/deleted_by_user/hcxr1fw/,1,r/SaultSteMarie,0,1
"Do you mean homeschooling as in actual correspondence/online courses not administered by the ADSB, or online learning with ADSB? Huge difference. Fair warning, my homeschooling info here may be out of date, I was taken out of ADSB and homeschooled for a year when I was a kid, but I can't imagine the process changing that much. Make sure to do your own research and take your time, this is a big choice.

For the former, you would have to sign a form you can get from the public board essentially saying that they are no longer responsible for the education of your child, it's a liability thing since they're tax-funded. This withdraws your kid from their current school, and then you would be responsible for their education. I highly advise researching and finding an accredited course provider that follows the Ontario curriculum. They provide the materials/lessons, you buy the books, you teach your kid, send it off and they mark it, boom, your kid has an official Ontario Ministry of Education Report Card. You may be able to find something local, but I haven't researched it enough to say for sure.

For online learning with the ADSB, I'm pretty sure that deadline has passed, and you'll need to either try and convince them to make an exception, or wait until January (I think? Not sure about the exact date). Online learning can be great for some kids, not so great for others, it's entirely dependent on the kid's learning style. If you're not sure, you may want to ask your kid's current teacher for their opinion.

Depending on your son's age, you may want to bring him in on this discussion too. Homeschooling, whether with you or the ADSB online, just isn't going to work if the student doesn't want to be there.

"You just kicked the hornets nest but I think it's great that there's a fight for best pizza, just goes to show how much good pizza is in this town.

I still stand by Ricardo's.  They were hit and miss for awhile but the last one I got was back to their old standards.  I guess it depends on what you like.  I love a cheesy pizza and some other places skimp on the cheese, at least for my taste.  Ricardo's makes a great cheesy pizza.

For a budget pizza you can't go wrong with Pino's, just get triple cheese.  I highly recommend putting sausage because it's their own recipe and they put it on raw which seems to make it more delicious.",t2_mvz9z,PeaTearGriphon,0,1630671785.0,0,t1_hbfsbi3,hbfsbi3,True,Tundradic,t3_pgr7td,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaultSteMarie/comments/pgr7td/best_pizza_place_in_town/,Best pizza place in town?,/r/SaultSteMarie/comments/pgr7td/best_pizza_place_in_town/hbfsbi3/,2,r/SaultSteMarie,0,2
