I didn't realize the competition for houses over $400. I was looking at what houses closed this week in Cary/Morrisville (so a biased sample) on Zillow. Everything that closed for $500-$700 sold for 25% over list price. Everything less than that sold for closer to 10% over list price. I really would have expected the opposite!

"Spend a week in Florida and you’ll come back to Raleigh feeling like you’ve been transported to a driving utopia.

Yeah, it’s gotten a little worse lately, but it’s still better than most other cities.

One thing that causes a lot of issues in Raleigh is that we have people from all over the country and world driving here, so they are all **different kinds** of bad drivers. Go to D.C. and you’ll see aggressive driving, but it’s okay because *everyone* drives like that, so it’s predictable.

Contrast that with here, where if you’re coming up to a four-way stop, you don’t know if the person to your right is a middle-aged woman from the Midwest that’s gonna wave you across even though she stopped at the stop sign first, or if it’s a young guy from Boston who is gonna gun it across the intersection before even coming to a full stop.",t2_8agey,vendetta2115,0,1648280440.0,0,t1_i263el9,i263el9,True,Pot8obois,t3_tnydbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/tnydbq/anyone_else_feel_that_driving_has_gotten_really/,Anyone else feel that driving has gotten really dangerous in Wake County?,/r/raleigh/comments/tnydbq/anyone_else_feel_that_driving_has_gotten_really/i263el9/,1,r/raleigh,0,1

"Skip Disney. I haven't been to Disneyworld but I believe there's been a while after COVID crowd with a ton of lines. I've been to Disneyland quite a bit.

"I think a big part of the fewer cars, but higher fatalities was because of the lack of traffic. Pre-COVID, there were maybe 8 miles of my 17 on the interstate where I was actually going 70. At least half of the way, I was going between 5 and 50 mph. Most of the accidents I saw on the side of the road were low speed fender benders that happened in the bumper-to-bumper zones.

After COVID, traffic thinned way out because people were staying home. Consequently, I was driving 70+ the whole way. The accidents I would see on the side of the road were clearly from much higher speed impacts. And I don't recall if this is the exact statistic, but it's something like the odds of an accident fatality double for every 10 mph over 50.",t2_14iygr,ballerinababysitter,0,1648268958.0,0,t1_i25ocdt,i25ocdt,False,Pot8obois,t3_tnydbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/tnydbq/anyone_else_feel_that_driving_has_gotten_really/,Anyone else feel that driving has gotten really dangerous in Wake County?,/r/raleigh/comments/tnydbq/anyone_else_feel_that_driving_has_gotten_really/i25ocdt/,2,r/raleigh,0,2

"Are you from here/live here? Or are you visiting NC/VA temporarily? Honestly, spending that kind of cash? None of the options appeal to me. Spending $400 at Frankie's is absolutely absurd. Please, save your money, and just remove Frankies completely. Also not a fan of Level7 (or really North Hills) in general. So with both of those out of the picture, you have an extra $550; perhaps spend that money on downtown dining/drinks/museums instead?

$2500 over 3 days at Virginia Beach also doesn't seem worth it, but I'm not a fan of Virginia Beach in general.

"this may be true of the boomer generation when you start talking about housing prices relative to income. but it is patently not true of gen x overall. there are a lot of people in this immediate area who have lived here for a very long time, who have worked VERY hard for many years to build good credit and save up money to buy a home, and many of us endured the brutal housing market crash here as well. 

what’s happening right now is not something anyone could have foreseen. and what people like you aren’t realizing is that many of us are stuck right now because of this crazy market. Many people would happily sell their homes, but they can’t afford anything else nearby, and certainly anything smaller or less expensive has already been bought up by an investor or a flipper. 

I expect our taxes will skyrocket now because of the climbing values, which hurts all of us scrubs who aren’t millionaires and who have already endured a doubling of our property taxes in the past 8 years or so. 

this current situation cannot last; it’s very bubble-like. prices may not settle back down to pre-pandemic levels, but the literal inflation of housing prices here will eventually level out and cool off. 

I don’t begrudge anyone the right to own multiple properties.

"This is NOT legal advice: however, when I did something similar, I sent two letters simultaneously. One was certified mail with signature required, the other was express mail with a tracking number. The reason? With certified mail, if they just ignore it and don't answer the door, that means that they'll never sign the receipt and therefore never receive it. But the tracking number for the express mail will show that at least one letter was in fact delivered.


If they dodge the certified letter, you'll have evidence that you tried sending a demand letter, they refused service, and you subsequently sent a second letter that they did receive (can't dodge the second one since no signature is required.)

After that, I filed a small claims case. The website will walk you through it step by step. It was extremely simple.

Then just show up to court with a new copy of your lease, any evidence you have of the apartment condition hen you left (I always film it in a final walk through.) and the certified mail receipt or proof of delivery from the express mail tracking number.

"By the time the pollening comes around the hardwoods are mostly done. But the grass kicks into high gear which is what causes most of the allergy issues during this time. Pine trees get the blame but it’s not them as far as allergies go.

Fall is ragweed and hay.

"As others have said, the scope of the job market and general ""city activities"" in Raleigh is much larger than Asheville, but I do deeply miss Asheville since I grew up there. 

For me personally, I grew up/lived in the heart of West Asheville for nearly 23 years and mainly through the rapid change and population boom. I love the area so much, but the general cost of living and lack of jobs is what made me move to Raleigh. If I could have the same job with the same pay scale in Asheville, I never would have left. The triangle area is just a better area in general for my personal career. As for schools, I did do a bit of teaching between Buncombe and Wake County schools, and the schools here tend to be pretty good in my experience, but that was limited to elementary and middle school.

Also another small note along with a thing some others pointed out, there is a sort of culture difference between Asheville and Raleigh.

This might not be popular but I'll just be honest: the quality of life is better overall in Asheville and it's not even close. Between the nature, the friendlier people, the art/music scene, the amount of traffic, and the amount of things to do (yes tiny Asheville has way more to do), there's a reason why Asheville remains one of the most desirable places in the Southeast.

Raleigh has a lot of great things going for it (like a FAR stronger job market, but that matters less with remote work now). But if you plucked a group of people from across the world and asked which city they would rather live in, most are going to pick the one where people spend hundreds of dollars a night just to experience.

"I think this would be rather easy with GIS source data. But idk if I have the interest to do that, lol. Might be depressing.


Also, from that thread:

>The largest owner, ""VB ONE LLC"" is Vinebrook Homes. They have purchased 514 homes since 2020 with an average price of $149k, a median of $86k, and a sum of $76m.

Bruh. 149k for a house in Cinci. That's way less than I thought it would be but also a lot more than I'd pay to live in Ohio lol

Edit to add: I am more familiar with JoCo's GIS System - and found the data pretty easily. Couple flaws with the linked posts' approach. They only filtered to owners with ""LLC"", I am finding INCs, etc that are excluded. Also, a lot of builders own land they are developing before the homes are sold, so I removed any parcel with a building value of $0. Idk how much faith I have in this data - but there are 21 LLCs in JoCo that own more than 75 parcels totaling $330M in real estate, averaging $160k per parcel (tax value).

I'm trying to download Wake's data but it is just saying ""We are updating the file. This may take some time"" lol. 

Last add unless I can get the Wake County info - obviously tax value lags behind ""going price"" quite a bit. Sometimes it can lag 30-50% of the value, so again, interesting data but not really reliable past knowing just how many parcels some of these LLCs own. 

There's a [""Progress Residential""](https://rentprogress.com/) that has nearly 1000 parcels in JoCo alone - averaging 330k tax value (total of 230M value). I used to live in Flowers, and the subdivision I was in had 10-12 homes out of 50ish owned and rented out by Progress.

">But in this market is it really a 300-400k house?  Or have the increasing prices made the 150-200k houses  double in price?

Same thing. What used to be a $200k house isn't a $200k house anymore because you can't buy one for $200k. There is no absolute value attached to any house.

>they are spending double (on paper) on a house.

Yeah, they're spending double on paper, in reality, and in every other way you care to say it. Sucks for everyone.

>*more disposable income anyway:  that’s actually not true as they are in higher tax brackets.  So they are paying 15-20% more in taxes a year comparatively.

It is true. Disposable income is what you take home after tax. Please explain how a guy with $70k income taxes home more money after tax than a guy with a $500k income. The former takes home maybe $60k and the latter maybe $370k. You're telling me $60k is more than $370k?

We bought this place for a stable roof over our heads, not as an investment.  Heck when we bought this place townhouses were considered a poor investment and about 10% of the units in this neighborhood were sitting on the market.

"Well no, the two crimes are treated differently because one is a violent crime and the other isn't. I'd agree if there was no recourse, but there literally is a legal path to take to get restitution through the court system.

A better analogy would be if you were paying someone to work on your house for you. They wouldn't just be arrested if they didn't follow through on the contract and do the work requested, you'd have to go through the court system to get your money back. 

It's a breach of contract not armed robbery.

"Yall please stop being ignorant asses and telling OP to not look for the dogs owner. Just because you've heard or seen examples of animal abuse with hunting dogs, does not mean its applicable to all hunters. Look at the dogs nails, you see how trimmed and neat they are? You see how healthy looking its coat is? That dog is by no means starved or underweight, he appears to be at a very healthy weight actually. This dog is clearly an old man whose gotten lost and probably has a family searching high and low for him and he is very dearly missed. Yall stop prattling about things you have no business talking about and telling someone to just find the dog a new home without looking for its owner. Thats some shady, cold hearted shit right there. And these dumb ass comments are just another reason why I prefer animals over people, because you have idiots  acting as if they know everything about anything without any factual evidence to back it up aside from he said/she said bs. I am by no means a fan of hunting, but I grew up in the stix and you have no idea how much time, money, and training hunters put into their hunting dogs. They aren't just gonna throw all that away or not take care of the animal. Does that mean every hunting dog everywhere is well taken care of, no, of course not. But that dog in the photo looks healthy as can be. So please OP look for its owner before you dump it off at a shelter. He's an old man so he most likely wont last long if its a full shelter already.

"From what I have heard from a few friends in the mortgage business, it's the same as it's always been, its just way worse now and people are frantic to buy. The ones offering $100k over asking are mostly from California, some from the NYC area. They (or their parents) sold a house that had appreciated tremendously and they bring that cash down here and wave it around to close the deal on the homes they want.

Imagine some retired folks who are sick of their ridiculous taxes in a little town that happens to be a quick ride to where apple or whatever is building its latest HQ. They've watched their taxes climb from $2k a year to $10k-$15k and they're sick of it. The house has clearly been paid off for decades. They're likely to get $1.5 to $2 million for it easily, and that's young tech bro money.

They see what they can get here for a fraction of that, taxes back down to earth, and they lose their MINDS. Hell, they can all fit comfy into one of the megamansions here!

"Before anyone criticizes the person crossing the street, ask yourself; where should he have crossed?

There are very few safe places to cross New Berm. Sometimes miles apart. 

My guess is the drive in this picture didn't have his lights on and the person may have had vision issues and didn't see the car clearly in the rain. 

Another thing to consider is a bus coming in the opposite direction, maybe he was that was the only bus for the next 45 minutes, and he needed to be on it. Perhaps if we had more frequent bus service this wouldn't be an issue.

Watching through the video, I can clearly see the person, yet the driver doesn't appear to slow down until the last minute which tells me he wasn't fully paying attention to everything around him.

"They can afford a 300-400k mortgage when the interest rates are that low. If you include taxes and insurance on a $350k house, that's around $1500/month. That's very doable at, say, a combined salary of $70k. They aren't going to find something comparable to rent for cheaper than that. You might choose to spend less of your salary on housing, but not everyone can or wants to. Some people are willing to sacrifice some things to live in a nicer house. Others are willing to sacrifice on the house to go on vacation. In graduate school I rented an apartment for $700/month (basically the cheapest housing in town). I was on a fellowship for $28k/year and I was doing just fine, eating well, going on vacation, etc. I even maxed out my IRA. Was I financially irresponsible for spending so much of my paycheck on housing? I wouldn't say so.

Doctors are so far removed from the $400k segment that they aren't even touching those houses with a 30 foot stick. Housing costs have gone up for everyone. Housing prices are going up across the board so most people are going to have to spend more of their paychecks whether it's on rent or a mortgage. People making less money are having to spend more of their paychecks on housing, so I don't really see the problem with doctors also spending more of their paychecks on housing. They have more disposable income anyway so it has less of an impact on them.",t2_3dlfa3we,nearlynothing2,0,1648172930.0,0,t1_i20fsde,i20fsde,False,Charming-Practice220,t3_tlrbwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/tlrbwz/single_income_trying_to_purchase_a_home_in_raleigh/,Single Income trying to purchase a home in Raleigh,/r/raleigh/comments/tlrbwz/single_income_trying_to_purchase_a_home_in_raleigh/i20fsde/,1,r/raleigh,0,1

"This makes me sad for you, and I don't blame you a bit for being so beat down by it. I hope you both love your new place in Winston. At least you'll have a decent rate on your mortgage -- if you'd waited that would have been worse too.

I really think this situation would not have accelerated so quickly without covid. People started roaming and seeing they didn't have to be house-poor forever. What we're seeing here is what happened to ""nice"" little towns in California until big tech started moving in and setting up shop. Breakneck increases in housing prices can only come from people who have the cash to outbid like drunken sailors (howdy, new neighbors from CA, NY state, etc.).

"Yeah that sounds more of a “hopeful” recovery rehab.  Versus a nursing home people dump granny at.  At those they will argue with you about how much medicine they can have, they will not feed them properly and the one physician who visits once a week is subpar.
