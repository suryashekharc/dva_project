"So if Bend is ""close enough"" to the beach, that means you're willing to live in an area that's about 3.5 to 4 hours away from the coast. Keep in mind its not a straightforward trek to the ocean.  So if you're willing to live that far from the coast that kind of casts a wider net for possible locations. What about Southern VT, NH, or western NY on the border of MA or rural ME?
Heck, you could even rent a summer cottage in block Island. Or you could explore rural MD, NC, SC...

Not sure what you're looking for in ""ocean life"". Yes the coast line is pretty... and very similar to Maines coast. You've only been in RI for a year. Have you explored Tiverton or Jamestown? You're only 3 hours from NYC, 1.5 hours to Boston  etc. Bend can feel extremely claustrophobic and crowded. 

In the end you're going to do whatever you want, but just consider other possibilities. This isn't the same place u left 10 years ago. I find it hard to believe that u follow this sub and haven't heard anything about the homeless issue here... I would suggest searching this sub for current issues regarding homeless problems in Bend. 

This place isn't unique. Its beautiful, sure. Our winter this year was abysmal, we're in extreme drought, and I feel like we're all prepping for an awful wildfire season.

You say you've ""been everywhere"" and like bend best. But what does that mean? You've driven through states and stayed a few days in select towns. There's still a lot you haven't experienced, I wouldn't put all your eggs in this Bend basket.",t2_ckvx7qi,THRILLHOUSE5000,0,1648290132.0,0,t1_i26ebku,i26ebku,False,msashleydavenport,t3_tnofdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/tnofdl/realtor_for_rental_properties/,Realtor for rental properties?,/r/Bend/comments/tnofdl/realtor_for_rental_properties/i26ebku/,1,r/Bend,0,1

"In that case, I would recommend you and the councilor read the book *San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities*. Because many of the suggestions use the same playbook:

* Blame the growing homeless population on housing costs
* Claim the free market isn't working and propose more regulation
* Use terms like 'equitable' and 'create task force to study the issue'

**Build enough housing** - Sure, but the problem is: now is not the time to build. Lumber is currently up 300% from 2020, copper is up 250%, aluminum 75%, etc. This is common sense. City council doesn't actually build anything, the private sector does.

"Ok, and this is actually an important point.  If you own a food cart lot and someone wants to lease a spot they have to keep their menu at a certain price range.  You see the same thing at events. A truck that normally charges 10-12 for an item may bump it up to 15 because the event manager requires that they do.  I know that the amphitheater *definitely* does this.  
  
You can’t have one vendor at the location coming in and undercutting the others.  I would bet that there is an average menu item price that needs to be maintained.  
  
So what do you do if you have a concept and want to showcase it at a location? You make sure your product meets the criteria.  I haven’t eaten here, but I see quality ingredients on this menu that you aren’t going to get at Donnie G’s or Taco Salsa.  Sweet potatoes, goat cheese, proprietary sauces specifically designed for this menu.  Eggs made to order. Does anywhere in town put sunny side up eggs in their breakfast burritos? I haven’t seen that.  I would hope the ingredients are of better quality than what you’d get at Rigoberto’s.  
  
It’s an interesting concept and I hope that the product is worth the cost.  I have yet to see a successful breakfast truck here in town.  Maybe this will be the one.   
  
It’s not cheap, but I won’t shit on something I haven’t tried.  Even if I don’t dig it, I might not be the target consumer.  Someone took the time to set this up. It’s someone’s baby.

"I just wrapped up an absolutely terrible move with United, they trashed so much of our stuff and were sooo late every step of the process.  Yes they pack, load, and unload if you want to pay for it.  I believe the packing for our house was an additional $1600 on top of the $8800 it cost just for the move.

Part of the problem with movers is it still largely comes down to the individual companies that WORK for United.  They just manage a network of independent companies, so one moving company might be awesome and two others could be shit. But they are all still technically United when you book them.

Anyway, most movers right now are vastly understaffed and all the people who put off moving during Covid are starting up again.

"We have actually shied away from too much UGB debate as YIMBYs. It is a huge, thorny topic where very reasonable people can disagree about aspects of it.

I think as cities grow, it's natural for them to grow up, in - and also out some. Even the city where I lived in Italy - which is way denser than Bend will likely ever be - was growing out *some.*

YIMBYs did support the effort lead by councilor Broadman to bring in some land via that Stevens ...uh, I can't remember if it's road or ranch, because there's two different things, but to the SE. There will be a significant single family unit component there.

I've always kind of figured that growing 'out' already has a pretty big constituency: groups like COBA support it and have a lot of money. They even have a paid person on staff to support these efforts, and additionally their EVP is our state senator, Tim Knopp: [https://coba.org/board-of-directors-staff/](https://coba.org/board-of-directors-staff/) \- that's a lot of clout!

Bend YIMBY hasn't spent a dime on what we do; it's just people talking and writing.  So we try and focus our efforts on those areas where there has historically been more NIMBY opposition and less political backing; infill.

Many of us live in single family units; it would be highly hypocritical of us to oppose their construction.

I hope that clears up our position some.",t2_1wsf,davidw,0,1648236998.0,0,t1_i23sg3b,i23sg3b,False,Melanie_Kebler,t3_tnd6pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/tnd6pq/the_rent_is_still_too_damn_high_update_on_city/,The Rent is Still Too Damn High - Update on City Housing Policy Work in Bend,/r/Bend/comments/tnd6pq/the_rent_is_still_too_damn_high_update_on_city/i23sg3b/,1,r/Bend,0,1

"I can imagine lots of higher density projects that could be successful and I think should absolutely be part of planning loving forward. Households have vastly different needs. From a family of 5 with pets to single people or couples who want less space and to ditch their car. Zoning should include space for both types of needs.

There are certainly some people that oppose single family home growth. An example is supporting an urban growth boundary that doesn’t reflect increases in population. Without land to build on, single family home lot prices are outside of what working residents can afford. Worse than that, there are none. I had to beg family for property to build here. 

In comparison, the market is perfect for high density mixed-commercial property. Property prices are through the roof, land is scarce and there is a housing shortage. Reading your posts sometimes feels like you support things like the UGB to limit options on what new construction can be built. Like that will force higher density housing by artificially restricting land. Which it would.

"Unfortunately that’s not true. The city is purposely set up to accept feedback on new construction including ADUs through neighborhood associations. Which impacts what can be built and what is approved depending on who complains the loudest.

Property developers have buyers preference in mind which encourages NIMBY behavior. There are a limited number of builders and the financial incentive to build multi family properties is not there.

This makes your duplex comment pretty funny. You said there are “plenty of legit reasons” of why that shouldn’t be allowed. Like what? What specifically would that person building a duplex do to affect you or your property?

"I can post a photo of Robal road if you need to see our homeless situation. It’s MASSIVE. Bend’s homeless rate has skyrocket since I moved here in 2019. There are tons of homeless here. They mostly camp on the east side of town (where rentals are). You’re correct that Portland and Salem have worse issues, but homelessness is here to stay in Deschutes county and it will continue to get worse. In many cities in California you see high contrast of rich/poor and it’s happening in all the desired towns in Oregon. Best of luck in your home search, I just want to warn you that Bend also has a serious crime, drugs, and  homelessness issue that will grow because of many issues the town simply does not have the infrastructure or resources to respond to. I’ve lived in Oregon my whole life and my heart is shattered because this place is being overrun by people with money. I’m relocating my family to Ohio next month because of housing shortage and the wildfire smoke will ruin your outdoor plans each summer. If this is the only place in Oregon you want to live, you’re not alone but Oregon as a whole is not the place it was years ago.

"""How dare those politicians have politics!""

But seriously, much as I love libraries in general and DPL in particular, the Deschutes Public Library system super dropped the ball here.  For those unfamiliar, they wanted to build a big new library, so they purchased a plot of land that they knew they could not legally build on, then after purchasing went to the city council to ask them to make a legal exception similar to the ones allowed for schools.

They shouldn't have purchased the land prior to getting permission to build.

West coast cities like San Francisco have abjectly failed to build anything like 'enough' housing. That's the failure. Most everything else flows downhill from that.

Which makes sense. Most people can't or don't buy a Ferrari because of the price. It's no surprise that when housing is really expensive, fewer people can afford it.

It's pretty well-documented that the people in power in places like San Fran and Seattle are not the ""build enough housing"" people like our city councilor.

"Road planning here is terrible. Hundreds of new units get added to a neighborhood with zero regard to traffic impacts on neighboring streets. I get adding housing, but why is the neighborhood impact ignored? People complain about traffic because it is getting bad. Housing gets built, more people move here, but little is done to mitigate the increase in cars. This is one thing contributing to people being so sour on new developments. Number one complaint I hear is that it feels like building housing takes precedence over everything no matter what, and developers take advantage of that. You can’t add thousands of people to one a lane street, do minimal street additions or connectors and expect everything to be fine. Why is this allowed to happen? I don’t even live on the west side but that high rise apartment at the Reed market roundabout and the complex at Spoken Motto will turn those areas into traffic nightmares. I’ve seen the plans, minimal street upgrades. You talk about reinforcing the need to to drive, there’s apartment complexes going up on the edge of town. People will have to drive no matter what.

"I like the approach, but I also think there could be an emphasis on not only building to solve the problem but also considering attempts to lower housing costs in Bend. 

We could tie the number of STR permits to the excess tourist capacity that cannot be served by hotels and the like, with a goal of STR permits being 0. Every time we need more to meet demand, use that demand to bring businesses who will hire and contribute tax dollars to the community. I also disagree that ~1.6% of housing being STRs isn’t a cause for concern

We should look into local taxes on investment properties, second homes, non-occupied homes and the like.

"**The problem:**
Too many people for our current infrastructure and housing.


Our primary industry here is tourism. For our area to pull in more $$, we have to attract *more* people, which just compounds the issue. Remote workers aren't going to contribute much to our local economy. They (we) buy groceries, pay for fuel, drink beer.  


Encouraging new **industry** to come in to the area should be a priority. BASX is a great example of this. They needed feet on the floor but also needed trucks to haul things. They needed raw materials, tools, and supplies. They even needed tradesman to help maintain and expand their facilities. They needed to hire utility workers, cleaners, etc. You get the idea.  


Inviting more people to come here, in order to pay locals more $$, because it's too expensive, because of all the people... it's short sighted.

"A few notes:

>b. It looks like applicants bought a 20-acre portion of certificate 90239 (now cert 95746) from the current user to get their nursery right. This supposedly moves 80 acre-feet in-stream and allows awards applicants 36 mitigation credits (36 acre-feet). However, only 33.5 acre-feet were awarded to the Middle Deschutes zone of impact. This allows applicants to pump 33.5 acre-feet (11 million gallons) for their application asking to pump water just over a mile from Tumalo Creek.

The instream transfer is for 20 acres at a *consumptive use* of 1.8 AF/acre. This amounts to the 36 AF instream. This allows for pumping of up 36 AF of *consumptive use*. This would amount to 64.8 AF of pumping for irrigation based on consumptive use of 1.8 AF/acre. Nursery use is a bit more difficult to define the consumptive use, but as you say, there's a lot that doesn't make sense. If you want to comment, a sensible argument would be that the consumptive use of 83 AF of water on *over 700 acres* would have to be 100 percent consumptive if it provided any actual benefit to the plant. How else could a little over 1 inch of water applied per year provide any benefit to plant growth? The applicant should be made to provide additional information about how water will be applied so that OWRD can accurately evaluate the consumptive use of the water. The whole point of drip irrigation is that it's highly efficient, which means you can't turn around and claim efficiency of 30 percent just to be able to say your use is less consumptive. There's [already precedent](https://apps.wrd.state.or.us/apps/wr/wrinfo/wr_details.aspx?snp_id=204297) for evaluating a nursery use like this at a much higher consumptive use coefficient. Check out the NOMO.

>b. The 33.5 acre-feet of mitigation the applicants will have preliminarily received (barring lots of public protests…) from MP 276 is no where near covering the 83 acre-feet they are asking for. This will could lead to partial approval of the application (11 million gallons) and the rest could be covered in future mitigation projects...

For the permit, all mitigation would need to be provided before permit issuance. They could use existing permanent or temporary mitigation credits to cover the remainder of the mitigation obligation without any new instream transfer being submitted. Creation of mitigation is a separate process from the groundwater application. Not much *there* there, in my opinion.

>e. There was no Well Construction Review completed for any of the 4 wells in the application. The wells are likely to pass construction standards, but a review would at least slow things down.

Not so. The well construction review is the memo that precedes the groundwater review. No *there* there.

>d. Pump tests on two of the proposed wells (DESC 59987 & DESC 59434) do not include a number for water level drawdown during their 1-hour pump tests. This is a little concerning and provides OWRD and the public with no information on how the water levels will respond if the applicant begins to apply water. In your protest:

Practically speaking, this is irrelevant. This is the Deschutes Basin, everyone knows the aquifer is highly transmissive.

>To make a Public Comment or Protest, you’ll have to wait for the Initial Review to be released which will likely come within the next month or two. If you’re impatient, you can mail the Water Rights Division with a “Public Protest for Application G-19069” at 725 Summer St NE Suite A, Salem, OR 97301. The caseworker for this application can be contacted via this link, but mailing a protest is much better.

You can't protest the application until a proposed final order has been issued, so don't bother doing this any time soon. It will take months, at least, before that happens. You'll have to pay a fee to file a protest. You would probably want to get a lawyer to go through that, honestly, it's a serious process and you can't just say whatever you want. Just sending in a letter with the words protest in it when there's no proposed decision to protest against is like doing [this](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*YuloYgF-Jp9KtgBX3ZGguw.gif).

You can submit public comment on the application once an initial review has been completed. This is probably the best course of action because you can say whatever you want and OWRD would have to address the comments in their PFO. That gives you something to protest, if that's what you still want to do.

"You are comparing two very different population sizes and housing options. While both are expensive they aren’t even remotely the same. Between mass transit, neighboring commuter cities, multi family homes, and abundant apartment complexes, it’s expensive but can work. 

Everyone suggests La Pine so let’s run the numbers. Cheapest plot of land is $70k on Zillow right now for 0.93 acre. No utilities or water, so conservatively we can budget $20k for that(but we all know in this market they can charge you way more). So before you even have a dwelling you are nearly $100k deep. New construction will easily run you $300-400k for a 3/2 2 garage in the area. So to live 30-40 minutes outside of bend(that land is a healthy distance off the highway) you have throw down 4-500k to have a home in La Pine on a servers income? 

Long story short, you are describing one area that is supported by a greater surrounding area. Bend isn’t that, nor will it ever be. We are too cut off.

"I doubt in the next 10 years or so things will ever go down to an actual affordable price. Affordable meaning not having to spend an almost a majority of ones take home on rent and having to have roommates. A 855 sqft house that backs up to 97 is now pending at $475,000. Per zillow this same house sold in 2008 for $240,000 when it was brand new. Somehow that house has been making over $16,000/year by doing nothing but existing. A 4Bd/3ba, 2,335 sqft house sold for $299,00 in 2011, and then $394,500 in 2016. Now in 2022 it has a pending offer listed at $799,999. Rents will never be affordable when a house, doing nothing, is making $67,500 a year for 6 years. Imagine being able to make $67,000 a year for half a decade by doing nothing but maintaining yourself. 

As much as 60 Minutes makes me want to gouge my eyes out their segment last week and rental prices did put out the conclusion that it is from a complete lack of available properties due to the '08 housing crisis. Per Redfin on the segment the US is short 4 Million rentals. That's more than the population of 23 states, and very close to Oregon's population. Imagine every resident in Oregon not having somewhere to live and that is where we are at nationwide.

In my experience its rare that an individual would spend so much time and money to sue, apply for permits, and jump through legal hoops just because.  There's usually a bigger goal.

Instead of focusing on all the douche moves he's done how's about putting one chess move ahead and prevent his next potential move.

So I guess I'm just trying to give my honest advice, which is that many people could be happier moving away, instead of living in poverty here.  Waiting until they can't afford to leave just makes things worse, so.. if you can't afford to live here, leave while you still can.

Here are the correct links.

I’m really sorry about the confusion.

"Here's a less encrypted version of the above:

I took a look at the document, links, etc. and there are a few items to note here:  
  
1.       The link you provided to the application is actually the Instream Transfer Application, T-13764. Here is the link to GW application G-19069 which is the one proposing to use \_\_ of water for nursery use at Tumalo.  
  
a.       The applicant is transferring water instream south of La Pine to USE AS MITIGATION for app G-19069. Essentially, in the Deschutes basin, you cannot get a WR App approved without mitigation credits which you can get by transferring another water right instream.  
  
b.       It looks like applicants bought a 20-acre portion of certificate 90239 (now cert 95746) from the current user to get their nursery right. This supposedly moves 80 acre-feet in-stream and allows awards applicants 36 mitigation credits (36 acre-feet). However, only 33.5 acre-feet were awarded to the Middle Deschutes zone of impact. This allows applicants to pump 33.5 acre-feet (11 million gallons) for their application asking to pump water just over a mile from Tumalo Creek.  
  
If you want to challenge the mitigation project (MP-276) contacting Sarah directly would just be a headache for her, but you can file a Public Protest to the Water Rights Division at 725 Summer St. NE, Suite A Salem, OR 97301. Be sure to site MP 276 and consider including the following:  
  
\-          Most of the 20-acre portion of Cert 95746 is forest. You need to prove the right has been used in the last 5 years in order to transfer it and there’s NO WAY the current landowner irrigated forest land. Portions of that water right in forest land are subject to forfeiture and CANNOT be used for mitigation. It looks like the watermaster previously raised this concern and adjustments were made to the application.  
  
\-          The rest of the 20-acre portion of Cert 95746 to be transferred in-stream looks like it is flood irrigated. There’s no way OWRD will be able to verify those portions of land will not be irrigated and the project completed.  
  
   
  
2.       Now onto application G-19069. The application is still under review. A groundwater review was completed a few months ago and pointed out a few irregularities:  
  
a.       The applicants are asking for a rate of 1 cfs (450 gallons per minute) and an annual volume of 83 acre-feet (27 million gallons). They want to apply that to over 747 acres for nursery use. I’m not sure what grows at 0.11 acre-feet per acre (83/747) in the desert.  
  
i.      OWRD can deny this application for that reason alone so feel free to use that in your Public protest  
  
ii.      The GW review says “extra scrutiny should be applied to the mitigation proposal,” hence, why section 1 above is important!  
  
b.       The 33.5 acre-feet of mitigation the applicants will have preliminarily received (barring lots of public protests…) from MP 276 is no where near covering the 83 acre-feet they are asking for. This will could lead to partial approval of the application (11 million gallons) and the rest could be covered in future mitigation projects so:  
  
i.      Keep an eye out for future instream transfers with the applicants name on it so we can continue to apply “extra scrutiny.”  
  
c.       Though the wells are over a mile from Tumalo Creek, the groundwater from one or several of the wells could be hydraulically connected to Tumalo Creek. Though Tumalo is above the Middle Deschutes, the applicants’ MP-276 mitigation credits could still be applied here. If you are concerned about flow in Tumalo Creek and the accounting described above does not sit right with you:  
  
i.      Mention in your protest that mitigation should come from the Tumalo Watershed. Water in the Middle Deschutes does not equal water in Tumalo Creek. (I don’t believe there is legal standard in this, but again massive protest applies pressure)  
  
d.       Pump tests on two of the proposed wells (DESC 59987 & DESC 59434) do not include a number for water level drawdown during their 1-hour pump tests. This is a little concerning and provides OWRD and the public with no information on how the water levels will respond if the applicant begins to apply water. In your protest:  
  
i.      Request the applicant provide 4-hour pump tests and record water level drawdown for each well included in the application.  
  
ii.      Request OWRD include a Water Level Reporting Condition and a Water Level Drawdown condition of the application is approved. This will require applicant to track water levels, and require them to stop/slow pumping if drawdown is severe.  
  
e.       There was no Well Construction Review completed for any of the 4 wells in the application. The wells are likely to pass construction standards, but a review would at least slow things down.  
  
i.      Mention a Well Construction Review in your comments/protest.  
  
To make a Public Comment or Protest, you’ll have to wait for the Initial Review to be released which will likely come within the next month or two. If you’re impatient, you can mail the Water Rights Division with a “Public Protest for Application G-19069” at 725 Summer St NE Suite A, Salem, OR 97301.

Oregon crosses threshold of 7,000 COVID-19 related deaths

https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORDHS/bulletins/310359d

  
Today, Oregon recorded more than 7,000 cumulative deaths, even as the state continues to see declines in hospitalizations and the start of a recovery and resilience-building process after more than two years of battling COVID-19, said Dean Sidelinger, M.D., health officer and state epidemiologist.  
  
“We again are reminded that COVID-19 continues to impact families and communities in Oregon, and we recognize each person represents a tremendous loss to those closest to them,” Sidelinger said.  
  
People in Oregon who have not been vaccinated remain at highest risk of serious illness, hospitalization and death.  
  
OHA encourages all eligible individuals to protect themselves against COVID-19 variants by getting vaccinated and getting a booster. They can find a vaccine provider using the Get Vaccinated Oregon tool here.  
  
**Last week (March 15), Oregon crossed the threshold of 700,000 COVID-19 related cases. Oregon ranks second lowest among states in the number of cases per capita (16,596 per 100,000).

"*Moderator may want to pin this comment*

I took a look at the document, links, etc. and there are a few items to note here:

1.       The link you provided to the application is actually the Instream Transfer Application, T-13764. Here is the link to GW application G-19069 which is the one proposing to use __ of water for nursery use at Tumalo.

a.       The applicant is transferring water instream south of La Pine to USE AS MITIGATION for app G-19069. Essentially, in the Deschutes basin, you cannot get a WR App approved without mitigation credits which you can get by transferring another water right instream.

b.       It looks like applicants bought a 20-acre portion of certificate 90239 (now cert 95746) from the current user to get their nursery right. This supposedly moves 80 acre-feet in-stream and allows awards applicants 36 mitigation credits (36 acre-feet). However, only 33.5 acre-feet were awarded to the Middle Deschutes zone of impact. This allows applicants to pump 33.5 acre-feet (11 million gallons) for their application asking to pump water just over a mile from Tumalo Creek.

If you want to challenge the mitigation project (MP-276) contacting Sarah directly would just be a headache for her, but you can file a Public Protest to the Water Rights Division at 725 Summer St. NE, Suite A Salem, OR 97301. Be sure to site MP 276 and consider including the following:

-          Most of the 20-acre portion of Cert 95746 is forest. You need to prove the right has been used in the last 5 years in order to transfer it and there’s NO WAY the current landowner irrigated forest land. Portions of that water right in forest land are subject to forfeiture and CANNOT be used for mitigation. It looks like the watermaster previously raised this concern and adjustments were made to the application.

-          The rest of the 20-acre portion of Cert 95746 to be transferred in-stream looks like it is flood irrigated. There’s no way OWRD will be able to verify those portions of land will not be irrigated and the project completed.

 

2.       Now onto application G-19069. The application is still under review. A groundwater review was completed a few months ago and pointed out a few irregularities:

a.       The applicants are asking for a rate of 1 cfs (450 gallons per minute) and an annual volume of 83 acre-feet (27 million gallons). They want to apply that to over 747 acres for nursery use. I’m not sure what grows at 0.11 acre-feet per acre (83/747) in the desert.

                                                              i.      OWRD can deny this application for that reason alone so feel free to use that in your Public protest

                                                             ii.      The GW review says “extra scrutiny should be applied to the mitigation proposal,” hence, why section 1 above is important!

b.       The 33.5 acre-feet of mitigation the applicants will have preliminarily received (barring lots of public protests…) from MP 276 is no where near covering the 83 acre-feet they are asking for. This will could lead to partial approval of the application (11 million gallons) and the rest could be covered in future mitigation projects so:

                                                              i.      Keep an eye out for future instream transfers with the applicants name on it so we can continue to apply “extra scrutiny.”

c.       Though the wells are over a mile from Tumalo Creek, the groundwater from one or several of the wells could be hydraulically connected to Tumalo Creek. Though Tumalo is above the Middle Deschutes, the applicants’ MP-276 mitigation credits could still be applied here. If you are concerned about flow in Tumalo Creek and the accounting described above does not sit right with you:

                                                              i.      Mention in your protest that mitigation should come from the Tumalo Watershed. Water in the Middle Deschutes does not equal water in Tumalo Creek. (I don’t believe there is legal standard in this, but again massive protest applies pressure)

d.       Pump tests on two of the proposed wells (DESC 59987 & DESC 59434) do not include a number for water level drawdown during their 1-hour pump tests. This is a little concerning and provides OWRD and the public with no information on how the water levels will respond if the applicant begins to apply water. In your protest:

                                                              i.      Request the applicant provide 4-hour pump tests and record water level drawdown for each well included in the application.

                                                             ii.      Request OWRD include a Water Level Reporting Condition and a Water Level Drawdown condition of the application is approved. This will require applicant to track water levels, and require them to stop/slow pumping if drawdown is severe.

e.       There was no Well Construction Review completed for any of the 4 wells in the application. The wells are likely to pass construction standards, but a review would at least slow things down.

                                                              i.      Mention a Well Construction Review in your comments/protest.

To make a Public Comment or Protest, you’ll have to wait for the Initial Review to be released which will likely come within the next month or two. If you’re impatient, you can mail the Water Rights Division with a “Public Protest for Application G-19069” at 725 Summer St NE Suite A, Salem, OR 97301.

"Hey! Yes, I work in water management in the region, and they publish these notices for a reason - that is, yes, comments are reviewed. However, there typically needs to be a legal reason for an objection for anyone to act on a comment.  Typically (but not always) those reasons have to relate to injury of someone else’s water right. 

That said, I believe OWRD just recently announced a change to how they deal with these “nursery” water rights. In recent years some people have been abusing the rules to get water by claiming “nursery” uses.  It’s a long story. I would have to dig around to find the changes to the rules - they’re pretty much brand new as I understand it. Also, although I work in water management, groundwater law has not been my focus so I’m not going to claim to be a perfect source on all this… I’m hoping this application will be reviewed under the new rules and as such not be approved or at the very least be heavily scrutinized.",t2_8s9nl,Jak947,0,1648079869.0,0,t1_i1v7e8s,i1v7e8s,False,FrizzyNow,t3_tlas4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/tlas4c/james_and_jean_verheyden_are_asking_to_pump_over/,James and Jean Verheyden are asking to pump over 27 million gallons of water out of the ground near Tumalo Creek.,/r/Bend/comments/tlas4c/james_and_jean_verheyden_are_asking_to_pump_over/i1v7e8s/,13,r/Bend,0,13

"So I read the linked transfer application. I am not a water rights or irrigation specialist so much of the application reads a bit dense using specialized jargon unfamiliar to me. It seems to me that the application proposes to transfer water rights to a volume of the Little Deschutes River - rights first granted to farmers in La Pine? in 1897 and now held by the La Pine Cooperative Water Association - to the Verheydens. It seems the Verheydens have purchased these rights from the current rights holder. This volume of water is proposed to be transferred instream from the Little Deschutes to the Deschutes to Lake Billy Chinook. Once transferred this water becomes 36 mitigation credits. Mitigation credits can then be used to extract water from a well in Deschutes, Jefferson, or Crook Counties (see https://www.deschutesriver.org/programs-&-tools/ground-water-mitigation/). Thirty-six mitigation credits becomes 36 acre feet of water per year. One acre foot of water is one acre, one foot deep. 

The Water Resources Department asked for comment, in January I believe, from the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife, Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, Oregon Department of State Lands, Oregon Department of Agriculture, and the Watermaster. The application only mentions that the DEQ said OK. The application does not mention how extracting this quantity of water from a well will directly or indirectly impact adjacent wells. This seems to be something the Water Resources Department would consider as Groundwater & Wells are part of the mission of the department. The Water Resources Department has given preliminary approval. Public comments to the Water Resources Department are permitted until April 21 before final approval/denial.",t2_32tmx,sbsb27,0,1648076576.0,0,t1_i1uzrvm,i1uzrvm,True,FrizzyNow,t3_tlas4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/tlas4c/james_and_jean_verheyden_are_asking_to_pump_over/,James and Jean Verheyden are asking to pump over 27 million gallons of water out of the ground near Tumalo Creek.,/r/Bend/comments/tlas4c/james_and_jean_verheyden_are_asking_to_pump_over/i1uzrvm/,18,r/Bend,0,18

"I disagree with some of the comments here. I feel that calling local freelancers ""predatory"" is uncalled for. We are mechanics of the web, just as there are mechanics for cars. While one can diy just about anything in life, sometimes it's better to work with a professional who has experience in the field. 

Working with someone locally means that you can meet with them face to face and bounce ideas. It also keeps revenue within the community. I feel those are good things. Sure there are bad apples, so do the due diligence. Look for solid contracts, estimates, timelines and call references, just as you would do with any contactor.

DIY platforms do make things simple, and Shopify is arguably the best one. But you may have a product that needs certain customizations or perhaps you want template edits and don't want to spend several hours learning how to code with the liquid templating language. While most can self teach or learn enough from some tutorials, others just don't have the time or technical capacity. Nothing wrong with that.

WooCommerce is a decent product, and highly customizable, though even the people that work there will say it is not as good as Shopify. There are cases when it makes sense, for example you may have an existing WooCommerce site, or you plan to add heavy amounts of content. As long as you have good hosting (don't get cheap shared hosting) and keep things updated, your site is going to be safe. Another reason some people like it is that you own everything since it is open source. You don't own your Shopify store, it is a monthly fee and closed source.

"Just keep in mind that whatever you get through whatever source needs to be maintainable over a span of years. The more successful it ends up being, the more this matters up front. 

Key tips: 

Keep control of your own domain name and registrar account. *Never* give that to a web designer no matter how much you trust them. This login information and what it can do is among your most important business assets, as important as the bank accounts.

When your web designer asks for DNS changes to make the site go live, either do that part yourself or have a different IT support company do it for you or give the designers their own account that you create for them to administer that. 

Also, the #1 thing web designers get wrong when going live is breaking your domain’s email. Make sure you make an offline copy of your working DNS records for email service before letting them change it. These will be the “MX” and “SPF” records. A penalty in the contract if they break your email when making DNS changes might be worthwhile. 

Right up front, before you sign a contract, make sure they offer you a clear migration path to another maintainer, and that you get it in writing in the contract. Better still, have them teach you the export process. 

If a web designer is claiming any trade secrets or secret sauce of any kind in their web design, run away immediately. You want nothing but current standards-based web design on open platforms. The site must pass all the tests at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ before you accept it as completed. 

They - or someone - must also commit to keeping the platform patched and up to date. You must pay someone to do this for you, or learn it yourself.

">our zoning laws are rewritten to allow for more multi-family housing and to offer subsidies to the developers to build affordable housing

Yes! Both these things are important.

Rather than ""next Aspen"", I'd encourage a look at, say, Boulder, Colorado. It's about our size, but their housing policies are atrocious, and it's not a tiny town in a steep valley. They have room to group 'up' and 'in'; even 'out' if they wanted. Instead, they don't even let people have roomates (no more than 3 unrelated people per home).

Here are some other good books on the housing crisis:

[https://dpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S94C1795857](https://dpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S94C1795857) \- very Caliornia centric, but it has a lot of history, and CA is where things got bad first, because of their policies.

[https://www.brookings.edu/book/fixer-upper/](https://www.brookings.edu/book/fixer-upper/) \- she's actually going to be speaking at the upcoming YIMBYtown conference in Portland. 

Also, in all of this, Bend is part of a wider west coast ecosystem, where what happens elsewhere affects us, and we're not going to fix things alone.

"Ugh, looks like they will be connecting the two halves of Bronzewood, and then linking that up that with an extension of Wilson. In my opinion that will create a quite busy east-west traffic cut through of the neighborhood as people access Wilson ave. 

Map of the proposed development for reference:  (pdf download link)

https://cityview.ci.bend.or.us/Portal/Planning/GetFile/164953

I get why it should happen, but in the true spirit of NIMBY I'm annoyed because it will mean a ton more traffic cutting through the neighborhood as people try to avoid the 15th/Reed roundabout, or to avoid bear Creek/15th roundabout area. 

Gardenia, Shadowood, and perhaps Teakwood are going to see a bunch more traffic. 

Currently there is no way to cut east-west from Pettigrew(aka Purcell) to 15th other than Reed or Bear Creek - there's just a huge rectangle in the middle bisected by the airstrip and the community center. Inside this rectangle is delightfully low-traffic, family-friendly, etc. By making the proposed street connections that will change as folks used to driving 45mph try to zip across thru the neighborhood to get onto Wilson. 

The other thing I dislike about connecting Bronzewood is it creates another street crossing for the Larkspur Trail. Not a huge issue in the overall scheme of things, but currently the trail is wonderfully mellow, adding this (busy) street crossing is not a plus in my book. At the very least this crossing deserves a pushbutton and lights for pedestrians/bikes.

&#x200B;

While I'm on a roll, the connection to the Coyner trail needs a re-route. Currently it just looks hardly like a true trail, just another very wide sidewalk, that crosses 5 parking lot entrances and two streets before meeting up with the Larkspur trail! Much better to just shoot it straight east from the Wilson roundabout, along the north property line, and meet up with the Larkspur trail near the upper right corner of the proposed development area.",t2_6983c,jimmythefly,0,1647984824.0,0,t1_i1prdxz,i1prdxz,True,charolastra_charolo,t3_tk4c99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/tk4c99/new_rental_housing_on_the_horizon_on_large/,New rental housing on the horizon on large undeveloped lot in Bend,/r/Bend/comments/tk4c99/new_rental_housing_on_the_horizon_on_large/i1prdxz/,5,r/Bend,0,5
"That’s fair and I think I need to take a step back to make something clear. As I mentioned, I’m clearly not an economist. However, I teach two separate courses at the moment through the lens of addressing the affordable housing crisis. I’ve been paid the past few months to research these topics as I develop lessons that serve to uncover ways to solve the problem at hand. To back up, yes we absolutely need more housing to be built because the population is growing faster than homes can be built. But, we have more than enough housing in Bend to support the individuals who can actually afford apartments for $1800+. We have no where near enough homes available for people making the same or less of the current AMI. The only way this would be resolved is if our zoning laws are rewritten to allow for more multi-family housing and to offer subsidies to the developers to build affordable housing. Currently, there is essentially zero incentive for a developer to even consider building affordable housing because since there is such a minuscule amount of affordable homes, developers know that people will be forced to pay more than they can afford in order to stay here.

"That’s a slippery slope. Every time new housing is built, it sets a new market precedent. This community claims the avg rent will be around 1800 per month.

Now, let’s consider myself for a moment; I’m a teacher making around 55,000 working full-year (through summer). The most I could spend on rent (without being cost burdened - over 30% of my income going to rent) would be around $1,300 per month. Annual raises tend to be between 2-5%. Even if this new development was somehow rent controlled, my wage progression would make me cost burdened after just one year. However, this development doesn’t have to adhere to those laws, which means it could start at $1800 and the following year raise to $2500. There isn’t a single new development in Bend that has below a 95% occupancy.

">Unless it's affordable housing, there's no point.

That's not how supply and demand work, though.

What do you suppose would happen to the price of used cars if we stopped building new ones? Oh, we're actually seeing that right now! The prices have risen dramatically! The way you get housing that's cheaper is either 1) big government subsidies or 2) building new housing so that the old housing is less appealing. I'm ok with more subsidized housing. Actually I'm more than ok, I think we need more of it. But it costs a lot of money that has to come from somewhere, and that's not an easy lift.

The actual, professional economist quoted in the article is saying the same thing, essentially:

"Rental housing is being planned on a 32.75-acre parcel where Wilson Avenue and 15th Street intersect that could be move-in ready over the next couple of years.

Construction could begin in late 2023 after the owners, Evergreen Housing Development Group, move forward with amending the original master plan to remove the commercial development that was previously approved. The Bend City Council adopted the project concept in 2015. The property was listed for sale for $10.9 million and sold in January.

The Wildflower Planned Development will be 574 homes — three-story walk-up apartments, townhomes, cottage-style single-family homes and duplexes — residential community with a small commercial area, said Jim Stephens, Evergreen Housing Development Group executive managing director.

Providing more housing in Bend is important to sustaining the community’s growth, said Damon Runberg, Oregon Employment Department regional economist. A housing shortage means new workers coming from outside the community cannot find a place to live, leaving employers at a loss to fill vacant positions.

“The answer to more affordable housing is to build more housing,” Runberg said. “Apartment complexes, in-fill, condominiums, townhomes, and yes, even more single-family homes need to be part of the solution.

“Building more apartments will help provide more affordable options for many residents who are being priced out of the local real estate market.”

The median sales price of a single family home in Bend in February was $740,000, according to the monthly Beacon Report, produced by the Beacon Appraisal Group in Redmond. The average rental rate in Bend for an 888-square-foot apartment was $1,803, according to Rentcafe.com, an internet rental market tracking website.

The Wildflower Planned Development is one of several so-called in-fill projects on pockets of vacant land scattered throughout the city. Others are small and all contribute to the overall housing mix, said Mike Donaca, SELCO Community Credit Union’s vice president of commercial and business banking.

“I like the growth. I’m excited for it,” Donaca said. “We need workforce housing. We’ll end up pushing folks out of the area to La Pine, Redmond or Madras. Then they’ll end up driving and commuting.

“We’re seeing a lot of stuff coming on line here at SELCO, but most of it is in the Eugene, Springfield and Portland areas. We’re seeing very little in Bend.”

The credit union has about $75 million invested in multi-family projects, compared to about a year ago when there was about $10 million, Donaca said.

Evergreen Housing, a Seattle-based development firm, presented its vision to the Larkspur neighborhood in November. At that time, the vision included plans to reduce the commercial element in the master plan and focus on the smaller area dedicated to commercial use.

At that presentation, the community suggested creating a food car area with seating in the commercial spot, Stephens said. Construction is expected to begin in the spring/summer of 2023, Stephens said.

The property, which abuts the Pinewood Natural Area, will include trails linking the Coyner Trail to the Larkspur Trail.

“We shared what our plans were,” Stephens said. “We’re working on a for-rent community. We think it’s a great way to bring needed housing to a community that needs housing.”

The project will be built in phases and includes onsite parking and a clubhouse.

This will be company’s fourth rental project in Bend, Stephens said. The company acquired and renovated the 204-unit complex called The commons at Pilot Butte and built the 205 unit Outlook at Pilot Butte. About to be completed is the 141-unit project called The Eddy on SW Bradbury Way, which is pre-leasing units.

“This is a long term investment for us,” Stephens said. “These will be market-priced housing.”

Currently plans are in the works for a roundabout to be built at the intersection of SE Wilson Avenue and SE 15th Street. SE Wilson Street will be extended to the east, according to a presentation to the community.",t2_488ev,blahyawnblah,0,1647968841.0,0,t1_i1om6u3,i1om6u3,True,charolastra_charolo,t3_tk4c99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/tk4c99/new_rental_housing_on_the_horizon_on_large/,New rental housing on the horizon on large undeveloped lot in Bend,/r/Bend/comments/tk4c99/new_rental_housing_on_the_horizon_on_large/i1om6u3/,11,r/Bend,0,11
