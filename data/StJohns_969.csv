"It is truly impossible to give good advise when so little information given.  Little drywall holes could be nail holes, a door knob hole, fist through a wall, head through a wall.... what's little!  

I think anything up to fist size you can by a self adhesive drywall tape/mesh that covers the hole, fill in then with compound.  You'll need to add several coats after drying and sanding each coat. 

Head size and up you need to cut from stud to stud and replace with a new piece of drywall.

There are other fixes such as putting a couple of small sticks behind the hole and screwing them in place then screwing drywall to those sticks.

"Bringing you insight from the B and T, Bisexual Trans woman here living in St. John‚Äôs. I think this is a place that seems safe and liberal for LGBTQ+ people on the eyes of cisgender heterosexual folks, but there is a lot of discrimination here. Cishet folks just don‚Äôt have the lens or experience to understand that so they think it‚Äôs safe and everything is okay.

You won‚Äôt be refused service or anything like that, but people can be rude and judgy. George Street is not safe for people who are visibly queer, they are often targeted with verbal harassment and physical assault. We‚Äôve had trans women in our community refused service at bars for ‚Äútricking men‚Äù, aka men finding a trans woman attractive and hitting on her, and then getting mad that he didn‚Äôt know she was trans and complaining to bar staff. Christians Pub is one to avoid.

Last year drag queens were being physically threatened for dancing in the pedestrian mall because they are queer.

There is a lot of bullying for trans kids in schools and administrators are doing absolutely nothing to reduce or stop it. Kids are being attacked in bathrooms and no adults in the school are taking it seriously.

You might see a lawsuit in the news soon for one of these schools or potentially larger, and it would be 100% justified.

"Oh, one of my favorite (and easy) interview techniques is to do a little bit of research on the company (or if it's a chain you can try to see if you can find an article about that particular store), and then tell the interviewer something about themselves, and how it relates to you. For instance ""I read online about the core values of company X, and I thought that they really align with me own beliefs. I've been kind of selective on where I've been applying, as I really want to add value to a company that I feel really speaks to me, and from what I've read I think this would be a great fit."" Or maybe ""I read that your store was the top seller in 2021 in Atlantic Canada. Your team must be top notch. I'd really like to be able to observe the management styles here and get to learn what makes this team so successful.""

If you're not getting interviews, maybe give your resume some tlc. Is it nice/professional looking? Has it been looked over by someone else for spelling and grammar? (I know appearances shouldn't make a difference over content, but it does).
Or are you getting interviews, and that's where it stops? If that's the case there may be things you can do to up your interview game. Dress professionally, do mock interviews with a friend to gain confidence, try to research common interview questions and prepare answers. Think about small talk, and how you present yourself.

An example is when the interviewer asked a few different astronauts if they could see the stars in space and some said yes and others said it was dark.
The interviewer also asked an astronaut to swear on the bible that he went to the moon and the astronaut punched him in the face.

It‚Äôs not ok to let your off-leash dog approach unknown people/dogs! I really wish everyone would keep their dogs leashed on hiking trails! It‚Äôs so stressful and horrible when we meet an off-leash dog roaming on a trail and they run up and jump all over my dog and she goes into fight mode and I have to break it up and drag her away barking and flailing. It sucks and I hate that my dog is like this and I‚Äôm working with her to reduce her reactivity but I can‚Äôt make her better instantly! I wish we could just have our own private spot to walk her, but we don‚Äôt, we have to use the same trails as everybody else (we‚Äôre constantly searching for the least popular trails to take her on!). Please just be mindful that other people and dogs on the trails might be super stressed out by your friendly off-leash dog approaching us. I know there are also many humans (esp young kids) who are equally scared of off-leash dogs approaching them!

"I lived more or less across the road from the airport for a few years, didn't find it bad, you'd hear it sometimes depending on the weather, really depends on how sensitive you are to noise.

That being said, St. John's airport isn't exactly a busy airport, and a lot of the flights are smaller planes.

Most folks will also get used to the bit of noise that is there pretty quickly, I used to have an aunt who lived next to the old rail road tracks... when the train went by, her whole house would shake, she literally didn't notice.

Not that the airport would be anywhere near that bad, but it's just a little bit of noise off in the distance once in a while, it's easy to get used to.

"> No no they didn't think it was round for 1000's of years

Yeah. 250bc is over 2000 years ago, and sailors knew the earth was round long before the middle ages. They noticed ship hulls would vanish out of sight before the masts when watching ships disappear over the horizon. Columbus sailed west to find another trade rout to India because he knew the earth was round, he just didnt know another continent would block his path. 

>By the Middle Ages, there was a widespread belief among the educated that the Earth was a globe. Columbus did face opposition on his voyage, but not from people who thought he‚Äôd drop off the edge of the world. Instead, people believed he‚Äôd predicted too small a globe and would run out of supplies before he made it around to Asia. It was not edges of the world people feared, but the world being too big and round for them to cross with the technology available.

You see, if the Earth is round, then no matter what point you stand on it, everything is downhill from you.

And that's how cars work.  The engines are just there to make noise to warn pedestrians and to force us to buy gas to keep oil companies in business.  Really they just coast downhill from wherever they are, and because the Earth is round everywhere is downhill from where they are.  This also explains why cars can go in reverse.

For forced air simply cover the ducts that you don't want to use.

For hot water, there may be a shut off valve attached to each radiator.  Simply twist the shut off valve.  WARNING: Those shut off valves are probably decades old and corroded.  They will be difficult to turn and may break and leak filthy water, and then you'll be on the phone trying to find an emergency plumber.

It may be easier to just get an electric space heater and use that to heat a single room.

I just started getting manzillian back in the fall.  I too was apprehensive about the tenderness of the skin however it wasn't that bad. Make sure you shave and leave about a quarter inch of hair. Have a warm bath earlier in the day and take an Advil about 30 30 minutes beforehand. It does this thing a little bit but it's well worth it. The Tech that is doing the treatment should know what they are doing. When I have it done she asks me to pull the skin taut and that definitely helps. Hope it all goes well and honestly it's kind of addicting!,t2_yp29o,yyzforfun,0,1645629378.0,0,t1_hy3whl2,hy3whl2,False,fineapple1989,t3_r8s4lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/StJohnsNL/comments/r8s4lw/body_sugaring_for_men_manzillian/,Body Sugaring for Men.

"I'm surprised nobody remotely mentioned Facebook marketplace. I personally can't stand Facebook but from a business side of things it's probably what will get you the most traffic. I would recommend setting up a Facebook and Instagram page under whatever name you want to go by for starters. Once you have all your information in and some of your portfolio posted i would then consider having a giveaway for one of your prints to rapidly increase your following. On top of this as others have mentioned I would check out farmers markets. A great practice for farmers markets is to have a business card handed out with every order that includes your social media handles. Finally I'd consider building a more professional website standalone from Facebook and Instagram. There are a lot of cheap builders out there that can help you achieve this and if you want some custom logo's or graphics done and digital drawing or graphic designs isn't up your alley you might be able to get some done half cheap from someone on fiver. Keep in mind I have never personally used fiver and some people like to discredit the site for poor quality control from user to user. Just be careful, do your own research, read the reviews and im sure you will be fine.

As a disclaimer I personally don't have any real experience growing a business.

"As I wrote in my post, I'm not interested in doing any investigation of Newfoundland English, the data I collect here will only be used to support intra-regional comparisons. If that is something you'd like to look at there is a wealth of studies on that topic. Sandra Clarke is the foremost scholar on Newfoundland English, so that is a great place to start!

This survey is, instead, intended to gauge the lexical variation between the different regions of Canada. I understand what you mean about frosting/icing and stove/range/oven - but you would be surprised at the amount of CANADIANS who use those words interchangeably. This is what I'm looking into. Which words appear in greatest frequencies in each region. I'm not looking at phrases or idioms - which would be a lot harder to investigate through a survey online - nor am I looking at accent - I do not have the time, facilities, or interest in doing acoustic analysis - I am only looking at lexical (vocabulary) variables. Those are good ideas, and if you're interested I refer again to the work of Sandra Clarke.

Anyway, if you want a more in depth discussion of this survey and its' purpose, I suggest you read Charles Boberg's original report: *The North American Regional Vocabulary Survey: renewing the study of lexical variation in North American English* (2005). You said you're studying linguistics, so you should be able to find it, same with the Clarke stuff.

"As well as another said with multiple words being synonymous and often interchanged depending on context, there are a few questions here that are not substitutes. Frosting and icong are two separate toppins used for the same process, a stove is a range+oven combination (thus calling the range a stove is wrong, it is a part of the stove, not *is* a stove) bathroom/restroom/toilet are used often by degree of formality (restroom is polite company, bathroom is neutral, toilet is relaxed). As someone studying linguistics, i feel you could have picked better examples that just wondering if we've kept our english/irish roots.

"Of course they prioritize main roads.

I don't think they prioritize cops or healthcare workers (unless they're friends of the plow driver?).

As an aside, my dad was the manager of a company.  Every year they'd hand out a very large snow clearing contract (they had a large yard).  That contract was heavily bid on by several companies.  In order to curry favor, we never had to pay to get our own driveway cleared.

"Nowhere is particularly unsafe, although some areas have more visible poverty and drug use than others. The area surrounding the Tim Horton‚Äôs on Harvey Road comes to mind (Long‚Äôs Hill, etc), but I personally find the area quite charming, especially with the new businesses popping up. The Nook and Cannery is a favourite of mine. :-) 

A few people mentioned avoiding Rabbittown, which may be good advice depending on what kind of neighbourhoods you are used to living in. I‚Äôve lived here for a few years now and find it okay, there are two grocery stores within a 5 minute walk from the house and it‚Äôs basically directly between downtown and MUN. There should be a bakery opening on the corner soon, and Jack Axes is a new addition to the neighbourhood. It‚Äôs walkable, many people don‚Äôt drive. It‚Äôs mostly populated by students and seniors, with a visible minority of addicts in the mix. Safety shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, the worst that‚Äôs ever happened to me is overhearing the occasional *very* loud argument.

Some parts of the west end of downtown face similar issues, and the suburbs are as safe and as boring as the burbs everywhere else in the world. Kenmount Terrace was mentioned by another user, I really wouldn‚Äôt recommend it myself, simply due to how nauseatingly cookie cutter it is. The houses are nice enough though, and there‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with the area if you‚Äôre okay always having to drive from point a to point b. It ends up coming down to your own preferences. 

I‚Äôd recommend looking into somewhere like Georgestown or the east end of downtown if you can afford it. Very pretty and uniquely St. John‚Äôs while not being ridiculously overpriced. Suburbs work great if you don‚Äôt mind the generic North American city vibe, or are referring to commuter towns such as Torbay/Witless Bay which are absolutely gorgeous.

"Depends on if you have, will have, a vehicle for transportation.  The city and suburbs aren't public transit friendly at all.  Biking and walking aren't great as much of the year the weather is not favorable.

If you drive then there's really no issue where you get a place.  Totally depends on your taste and budget.   

If you don't drive then find a place close to a grocery and other amenities you may need.  

Outlying towns, Paradise, CBS, Torbay, Kilbride, etc aren't really great choices unless you have a vehicle.  The costs of rentals are usually a bit cheaper when you go to those areas. 

Be careful of renting in the downtown core if you are wanting fire/rental insurance.  Many of those older row homes are either not given insurance or are rather expensive to insure.

"‚Äú...there is a higher level of snow/rainfall but the the temperature itself is milder in comparison to both Fort Mac and Rimouski, don‚Äôt know if you would agree with that‚Äù

That‚Äôs basically exactly what I said lol. 

I lived in St. John‚Äôs for 10 years (before moving overseas) and I definitely grew to love the place. I just think people downplay how brutal the winters can be... but mostly because of how long it drags on and how dreary it can be. I‚Äôve lived in Ontario and a few places in Quebec and in Newfoundland. In Ontario and Quebec it‚Äôs definitely cold, really cold. And I know Northern Alberta can be even worse. But winter there is *relatively* sharp and quick. It doesn‚Äôt feel quick in the middle of January lol, but by March things are starting to warm up and there‚Äôs a lot more sun. Some years in St. John‚Äôs it gets cold & dreary at the end of September and It doesn‚Äôt feel like you see the sun again until the start of June. Of course I‚Äôm exaggerating, but one bad winter and you‚Äôll understand. 

Anyway, I‚Äôll get off my soap box. Basically, if you‚Äôre up for an adventure (and not typically affected by seasonal SAD), give it a go.

"Honestly, if you haven't checked out the museum's and touristy things yet, that's not a bad idea. Highly recommended doing a boat tour at least once, in the summertime of course.

The Rooms and the Geocentre are worth checking out, they both have changing exhibits so even if you checked them out before, might be worth a look again!
Seriously, even as a local I feel like I learn something new everytime I go there. 

Obviously those are things  you wouldn't go do all the time, but interesting from time to time.

As for what I do for fun... Not going lie, hiking/walking is up there on my list. I get you're not into that, that's totally fine! Lots of people enjoy outdoor activities here, including swimming, snowshoeing, fat biking, bird watching, skidooing, having a boil up/beach fire, etc. But if you're not into that any outdoor activities, there's still lots of other things to do. Maybe moreso in the summer though, this is when there's more on the go in terms festivals, events, shows, etc.

There's local restaurants/microbreweries, axe throwing, bowling, other organised sports, going to a movie/show, farmers market, etc.
All those things are pretty standard no matter where you live though.

My personal recommendation would be to ge into a hobby. Depending on what you get into, this a good way to meet other people or find out even more things you might be into.

I am into gaming (video and card/board games) myself, and that's what I usually do with my friends too! We usually enjoy the local things more in the summer when we can go out for a few beers on a deck, have a BBQ, have a backyard or beach fire, go berry picking, or go for a drive outside of town.",t2_dehnn,Sokalled89,0,1644516667.0,0,t1_hwebf9c,hwebf9c,True,[deleted],t3_spa8h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/StJohnsNL/comments/spa8h9/i_feel_like_ive_been_on_every_hike_you_can_find/,I feel like I‚Äôve been on every hike you can find in this town.

Congrats to you if you've done them all though, some real lovely hikes in there even if you don't enjoy it as you say.

"Restaurants fill up fast on VD.  They're also limited to 50% capacity.  Start calling around now and try to make a reservation, there may not be any anything available.

In other words, it's probably too late to pick and choose a restaurant.  You're going to have to take what you can get, if there even is anything to get.

There's a few places like Montana's and Swiss Chalet that don't take reservations.  Be prepared to line up for an hour though.

If you do go to a restaurant, it probably won't be romantic.  So make it.  Purchase or make something for your loved one, excuse yourself from the table, and give it to the waitstaff to deliver with your dessert.  Even if it's just a card.

Don't forget to tip.

The weather is calling for -3 and snow, so most outside things are a no-go, unless you like the cold.

Personally I'd go with Netflix and their favorite home made meal.  Just don't forget that it's also your job to do the dishes (or you can do them together). 

Or like someone else suggested, get a hotel room.  No one is travelling, so those are readily available.  Some champagne and strawberries will seal the deal.

"Hard to say about making friends because we knew people before moving here, and I haven't really tried outside our existing friend networks. We moved here (from Edmonton) in August 2020 because my work went to Work-from-Home and my wife's father lives about an hour drive from St. John's and we had not seen him much since the travel was too difficult. 

But I can say genuinely that the people here are quite welcoming and approachable, generally. Last year, we had some heavy snowfalls and we didn't have a snowblower, and two neighbors offered to clear our driveway. One day, we woke up and our driveway was already done, lol.

There are two strip clubs. there are great restaurants like Magnum and Stein's, Merchant Tavern (book ahead), Adelaide Oyster House (book ahead), Gypsy Tea Room. Mallard Cottage also awesome, but they are closed ATM due to Covid, they may open in late Feb.

"I commend you for the level of detail, but I think it's not a good idea to use acid wash. Curious to why you think it is?  Like what's a benefit beyond looking clean/less rust? Remove rust/dirt sure, but you are also removing metal too.   It's a corrosive material you are spraying on things like brakes lines, gas tank, floor pans, etc.  You are actually eating away at any metal you are apply it to right.

"Car wash will not protect or save you from rust. No in this climate where tons and tons of road salt is spread on our roadways every year.  You really need a application of a rust proofing - I recommend corrosion free from Canadian Tire.  It's reapply every 18 months.  If your vehicle is 3 model years or newer and you continue to application regularly they guarantee rust free.

If you want a car wash there is a nice drive thru or self wash at Triple C.  It's at 66 Old Placentia road in Mt Pearl.  

I have keyless entry so I find the doors don't stick since no key hole, I guess that doesn't help if you car doesn't have that already.  However you can get a teflon spray, use the little hose and fill the inside of your key hole.  It works as a lub and keeps water/frost away somewhat.  You can use a good lube to spray the rubber seal around your door too. For that I like Fluid Film.  I find it helps and I will also spray it at the base of the window where the rubber meets glass. Also I then wind down the window and using the little straw and a paper towel to catch overspray I do the rubber that would seal the window when it's up. 

 Depending on the vehicle run the AC.  The cooler air is drier, it helps keep the interior from getting frosty on the glass.  It really makes a difference if you car can have heat and AC.  This can also help preventing freezing doors.

WD-40 is okay, but there's much better lubes/sprays out there.  Keep a bottle of lock deicer in your home mail box, or winter coat pocket.  

You should also have rubber floor mats that catch the melt from you boots.  Deep veined one are good to keep the wet away from your pant hem.  

Keep windshield washer topped up or a bottle in the trunk. Obviously a nice ice scrapper is worth it's weight in gold.  One with a long reach helps for clearing the roof!

If you can park in the sun, especially it helps even in winter!  I am on the side of the street where I don't get the early morning sun in my driveway but neighbor across the street does. There have been sunny morning where a light frost would coat my car and his car was frost free!

I also recommend a good oil change and grease in the late fall before winter.  I synthetic oil is best, but lower viscosity ""winter"" oil is a close second, especially for those really cold mornings.  Make sure your coolants is up to the task of not freezing, that's a major repair bill if your rad or engine freezes up.",t2_2xk5frlj,BrianFromNL,0,1644189860.0,0,t1_hvvhtxa,hvvhtxa,True,dorianneto,t3_sm6wkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/StJohnsNL/comments/sm6wkp/advises_to_keep_the_car_in_good_conditions_during/,Advises to keep the car in good conditions during winter,/r/StJohnsNL/comments/sm6wkp/advises_to_keep_the_car_in_good_conditions_during/hvvhtxa/,7,r/StJohnsNL,0,7

"Yeah, it's a pain that Facebook has taken over the market for so many things. I generally don't like to recommend people view Facebook pages, but when it comes to rentals, it really is the place you've got to go now.

There are a few pages I'd recommend:

-Pet Friendly Housing in Newfoundland & Labrador (specific to pet-friendly housing)

-Newfoundland Tenant & Landlord Support Group (specific to discussions about the rules/regulations of renting in NL, and how to navigate the system)


For electricity, it can vary quite a bit depending on the size of the home/apartment, and the age/how well it's insulated. I live in a newish house (early 2000s) and for the main floor and about 20% of the basement (because the rest is a basement apartment) our monthly heat bill tends to be between $100 in summer, and $300 in winter.

In an older house it's not uncommon to see $600 bills in winter. But it will vary wildly depending on the home, and how you use the heat.

A lot of houses have now started to install mini-split heat pumps which have a significant impact in keeping electrical bills down, however you're unlikely to find this installed in many apartments that are up for rent.",t2_d59p6,Zedoack,0,1643596389.0,0,t1_huxwl1n,huxwl1n,False,[deleted],t3_sgnlsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/StJohnsNL/comments/sgnlsa/pet_friendly_apartments/,Pet friendly apartments,/r/StJohnsNL/comments/sgnlsa/pet_friendly_apartments/huxwl1n/,3,r/StJohnsNL,0,3

"Your best bet for finding an apartment is on Facebook now. Most people seem to have moved away from Kijiji unfortunately. 

There is a Facebook group specifically for pet-friendly apartments in the province, but it can still be tough. Your best bet is to message a lot of listing and just ask if they would allow your pets.

I do think it might be a bit early for an apartment in April/May, but within the next month you should start to see some available for April at least.

Edit: You're also probably going to have a hard time finding something with utilities included. Most heat here is electrical, and it's too easy for tenants to open windows in winter with the heat cranked to 30 causing thousand dollar heat bills.
