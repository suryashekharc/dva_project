The crust was tasteless and completely cardboard flat, the toppings tasted weird and processed.

"One of my sibilants took the course a few years ago. He enjoyed it but had some trouble finding work off just the NSCC program in this area. You may want to research paths to water treatment career because there may be a more effective and less expensive route that doesn’t require the NSCC two year course. 

Regardless, if you are interested in the program, I know first hand that the staff at NSCC in Port Hawk. are all very nice and helpful and if you contact them I’m sure they’ll send you or discuss any questions you have. You may even be able to “test drive” the program which is usually involves you meeting the teachers and students and have a day of class with them just to see if you like it and to get some more direct information from the people currently in the program. 

As far as living on Cape Breton, I do not recommend it. It’s beautiful and relaxing, but expensive and lacking in employment. The area is frustrating to make a successful and comfortable life in. Most people leave for various reasons, but know that it’s not as enjoyable of a place once you have all the bills and little to no work.. A lot of communities are very tight knitted too. Yes they  love visitors and tourists, because they spend money, but as for welcoming new permanent residents, you may find some people and business less receptive than others of you.

"When I purchased in 2012 we hired a “home inspector” which was about $500. We had two gentlemen come and climb all over the house and give us the ok.

I had not but my wife’s father being a “handyman” assured me everything was up to code. 
I was then informed by the broker that I’d need a letter from an red-seal electrician as well as a plumber to acquire insurance. When I asked what the purpose of the home inspection was he said there is none. “ We want letters from electricians and plumbers.” “Home inspections are not necessary”.

"Haha. House inspection is not a trade you dolt. I stated repeatedly that you should hire tradesmen not house inspectors. But yah, I guess on your expert advice I should seek some professional help. Do those professional house inspectors cover that too? Should I hire the RSE house inspector for that?

No? Is it because they aren't actually licensed or qualified to do anything I should maybe look for someone who is?

Is it so hard for you to say that you made a mistake and house inspection is a farce?

You say the inspectors have value when they do their job right. Who decides what that criteria will be?

Seeing is how any idiot can call them selves a house inspector I would argue that they don't have any inherent value other then fleecing unsuspecting home buyers.

But that couldn't possibly be the case.

You're basing your whole argumentation on people who are bad at their job. That problem, sadly, is not exclusive to home inspectors.

"I'm more inclined to suggest orienting the search towards a good home inspector than a good realtor.

I have no suggestions unfortunately. I bought 2 years ago and the more time goes by, the more letdown I feel towards the service I received. I'm discovering all sorts of ""fun nuggets"" that should've been found by the inspector, some that will cost upwards of 10k to fix if I ever find anyone as every tradesman is busy until 2035.

Protip: ""Stars"" review on Google don't mean much in CB. Everyone has around 4-5, and anything deviating from that needs a personal interpretation. (Ex. restaurants doesn't offer big portions but provides quality instead? Oh man you sure don't know how to pick your hill to die on in CB, just throw some more fries and fried chicken!!)

EDIT:

You NEED an home inspection. Don't let realtors fool you. Yeah real estate is red hot even here, but with the weather we have, the average age of a home, the floodings, etc... Might be worth it to rent a house for a year before buying.

We visited several houses before buying. There's so much weird and sketchy stuff going around.

"This is the actual tax rate table for the cbrm:

https://www.cbrm.ns.ca/tax-rate-information.html

There is no ""average"" cost for a well. It depends on the depth of the water. There can be a wild difference between even neighboring properties. The same for treatment. You will either need no treatment, or need treatment.

Septics are expensive, but again, it depends on the soil conditions. 

If you are considering a new build, get estimates on these things. 

There are many things to consider other than tax rates when you are trying to decide on serviced/non-serviced properties. 

My personal decision was building in a non-serviced area. Yes, we needed a well and septic but we have an acerage which was important for us.

Also, as far as ongoing maintenance on these systems, it is virtually nil. Other than pumping the septic every 3 years that's it. If you have treatment on your well that could run $100 a year.

"You’ve got like 4 things going on here in the CBRM:

1)Way below average property values. The total combined value of property here in quite low so in order to collect the same amount of revenue as another municipalities the rate has to be higher. It doesn’t mean you’re bill is higher, just the formula has to be different.

2) Out-sized effect of the CAP program. The CBRM has much more property value shielded from taxation that other Nova Scotia municipalities. Halifax is around 10% while CBRM is in the 20-25% zone. Like point 1, this means the city has to up its tax rate to fill that hole. This brings up some complicated logic about how the CAP works and who is actually benefiting but that’s for another day. If the CAP was removed and the city could leverage the entire market value, it could collect the same revenue at a rate of about 1.65% +/-.

3) The city has a larger percentage of its budget coming in taxes than other forms of revenue compared to other cities. It’s a fairly common political tactic to lower taxes but increase or introduce fee and fines or possibly even privatize services like garbage collection so you get 2 bills that may total higher but the city can lower its taxes and gain the political capital from it. The CBRM is not good at all at collecting non-tax revenue. Higher rates to use the dump and having more and enforcing existing paid parking could bring in revenue in the low to mid-7 figures which they could use to lower tax rates but here we are. FYI, in total, the HRM collects about $1000 PER PERSON more than the CBRM does.

4) CBRM doesn’t really employ the smoke and mirrors tactics other cities use to mask their tax rate. The could be said to be a good thing in the name of transparency. Politically speaking, the city could do themselves a favour by making sure everyone knows that a big chunk of the tax rate is mandated payments by the provinces for things like education.

So, with that you can say that you’re going to get Way More house for your dollar in the CBRM and you don’t have to pay the bank to finance this elevated amount that you would elsewhere. My recommendation would be to have a serious talk with your real actor/bank about what your tax rate will be (because, due to the CAP, you’ll definitely pay more than the person you’ve purchased the house from.

"It is called the Maryann Corbett Trail. In Sydney there is Baille Ard Trail which is very beautiful and popular, and also Greenlink Rotary Park Trail which is even closer to downtown - Part of this trail is an off leash dog walking area.

The Sydney Boardwalk, and walking trails around Wentworth Park are also popular and both downtown.

Cape Breton is really a wilderness paradise. You can find extremely beautiful spots where there are hardly any people. Pick any spot on the map and there is something beautiful there.

1. Beaches. The ones on the west side of the island are the best, like at Inverness, but we are really spoiled. There are like a dozen beautiful beaches within a 60 minute drive from Sydney, Dominion Beach or Mira Gut for example.

2. The Cabot Trail (very scenic highway loop with countless hikes, campgrounds and things like that. Plus hiking and camping in general. I have been doing it for years and every year have new places to explore that I've never been to. Look on hiking websites and avoid the tourist trap ones like Skyline Trail. It is beautiful, but always packed full of people. We also have a great wildlife park I visit a few times per year. They take in rescued/injured wildlife only.

3. Museums. Fortress of Louisbourg, Alexander Graham Bell Museum, Glace Bay Miners Museum, Beaton Institute at CBU (Scottish/Gaelic history of Cape Breton). Also I recommend Goat Island tour in Eskasoni. Extremely beautiful spot and to get Mi'kmaq culture and history.

4. Outdoor sports. Kayaking, Canoeing, paddle boarding, skiing/snowboarding, snowmobiling (you can rent these).

5. Just take advantage of the slow paced lifestyle. There is no traffic and so many things are close. There are waterfalls, countless hiking trails, numerous sandy beaches all that can be accessed in less than 30 minutes of driving from downtown Sydney. Even locals really take this for granted, minus the beaches.

"Most of the 'trails' in Sydney are a pretty long walk from downtown and not accessible from the university, although there is 1 trail around the university.

The school is pretty meh, but it's a university and you'll get a degree. Then can possibly go to a better school after that if you want something higher. The reality is most of the schools that accept high amounts of international students are pretty meh. That is how our system works, it is basically the schools where there aren't enough Canadians to attend, so the vacancy is filled up with international students.

The only area I would recommend living in without a car is walking distance to downtown Sydney and the Welton st plaza where Sobey's (grocery store) is at. Anywhere else, a car would be ideal.

There is no uber, just taxis and a small bus route that covers all the main areas and Sydney to CBU. You can work while at school but I think you are limited to 20 hours per week. It should also be pretty easy to find a job near minimum wage if that's what you are looking for.

Sydney itself is a small town in an area that was economically depressed. The economic collapse is over-with now and things are on the upturn. There is construction and new businesses and restaurants popping up all the time. Population is increasing and unemployment is going down (it used to be double the Nova Scotia average years ago), but there are still many effects of the poor economy still seen, even more so in the smaller surrounding towns like Glace Bay, New Waterford, North Sydney. It's a pretty town with tall trees, ocean boardwalk and some public ponds/parks. Like someone else said, people are friendly and will chat with you in the lineup for the grocery cashier, but it can be hard to make friends that you hang out with. Coworkers or school groups is a good bet and try to insert yourself in any activities that might be going on like a hike or going to trivia night at a bar or something.

Keep in mind too that Nova Scotia and Atlantic Canada are very rural, over 1/3 of the population is rural, probably even higher in Cape Breton, where the rest of Canada is like 10-20%. Until recently Cape Breton was like over 95% Caucasian. There are going to be rednecks and racists, there are anywhere. Younger ones are generally more self aware, but I'd like to think that CB is better than small towns in say rural Alberta or Ontario, but that's not really my place to say.",t2_8gvlmq0l,smoothies-for-me,0,1646513304.0,0,t1_hzht6gg,hzht6gg,True,Selfdefenseguy,t3_t785de,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeBreton/comments/t785de/hello_cappers_questions_from_an_egyptain_thinking/,"Hello cappers, Questions from an Egyptain thinking of spending a year at Cape Breton university",/r/CapeBreton/comments/t785de/hello_cappers_questions_from_an_egyptain_thinking/hzht6gg/,6,r/CapeBreton,1,6

"I’m not in Cape Breton but up there all the time for work and I vacation there whenever possible so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 

Going to school at CBU would be great if you can get out and explore the pretty parts of the island. The Cabot Trail is a treasure that’s easy enough to access with a vehicle. Canadian winters are cold and last about four months in Nova Scotia, about half the school year. It’ll be warm when you arrive and slowly get colder and colder and then all the snow will be gone, it’s still cold, but mildly warmer and when you’re gone it’ll be hot again!

Depending on what sort of visa you can get you can work. If it’s just a straight up student visa you’ll only be able to work at the school (I think, that may be different now). The good news is most schools save as many on campus jobs as they can for foreign students. So you might get a part time job sweeping floors, working cash in the cafeteria, security at events, etc. that said if you have any Manual labour skills you could find cash jobs from anything like cleaning houses to moving company worker or possibly some demolition/ construction jobs. 

Locals are nice but don’t expect them to welcome you with wide open arms. Nova Scotia is a racist place but no one wants to admit it. The good news is if someone makes racist remarks your way there’s some one else nearby that will defend you calling that person an asshole. Still that stuff shouldn’t happen in the first place. For the most part you’ll get people not really caring you’re there at all. All that said the university has programs in place to help make friends and be part of the community by people who will support you whom also hate the racists. 

I don’t know if there’s much Uber in the area but there are taxis. A local could answer that better. 

There are nice trails around the area but honestly the best ones you will need a vehicle to access. One of the best zoos in the province is nearby, the Two Rivers Wild Life Park which is mostly local animals, deer, moose, coyotes, bears, etc. Its great because it’s build in the woods pretty much. Your walking on a trail and hey wow there’s a fence here and there’s elk! If you didn’t grow up seeing these animals it might be a bit more impressive too.

"CBU is generally rated as one of the worst unis in Canada. This doesn't mean it's necessarily bad, because Canadian education across the board is quite solid, but I don't think you're going to be blown away academically. It's also a small university situated sort of in the middle of nowhere. Close communities are Sydney and Glace Bay, and they're both very quiet. I moved to Sydney from a major Canadian city and have mostly been bored out of my mind here. People are friendly in that they'll say hi and that, but they probably won't be jumping to include you, as someone from away, in their activities. I've been here over a year and despite my best efforts I still don't have a solid social group because, well, people are just cold and exclusive here.

There's lots of natural beauty to explore in the region if you have access to a car. You could spend years visiting different parts of Cape Breton and still not have seen it all. I would absolutely recommend visiting for that, if it's worth it for you. But of course it's just one part of the experience.

There is a loop there that can be day hiked or camped on, it's around 16km. I have done it and enjoyed it, nothing too challenging and good coastal views. I'd give it a solid 4/5.

It's sad that this stuff needs repeating but some other trails that recently became popular on social media have been all but destroyed by idiots, and it's disgusting to go there on a busy weekend where people leave toilet paper in bushes, trash and used camping equipment in fire pits, bottles behind, they move stuff around and build fences and structures, etc... basically the exact opposite of Leave No Trace principles.

"If you liked Lunenburg in the winter I think you would like Sydney too! It's so nice to hear of people exploring the province for fun. The drive from Halifax is not super picturesque but once you get across the causeway onto the island it gets better! 

Dr Luke's is the best place for coffee downtown but the Bosyenberry Cafe also has a nice atmosphere. On Paper books is a local indie store. The Middle Ground boutique also has fun local stuff. The Cape Breton Centre for Craft and Design has local art and artisans exhibits along with a gallery shop. The Old Sydney Society might also be open with an exhibit. 

Sydney was founded in 1785 so there are a few stone churches and wooden houses that date from then still standing and you'll be able to see the outside at least and there some plaques and things. 

Depending on when you arrive there might be a show happening at the Highland Arts Threatre or some local music at Governors Pub. There is also a cool cultural space in the north end called Eltuek. They also might have workshops/music etc. Oh and Membertou! A Mi'kmaw community connected to Sydney..Membertou Heritage Park is a really nice museum and cultural space. 

There are some interesting food places that have popped up in the last couple years too downtown. Naru, Jenan's Syrian kitchen, and Lebanese flower are favs. Flavor on the Water has nice views and seafood although a little pricier. 

If you're interested in just seeing culture I would also go to Whitney Pier like someone else suggested. It was once the most multicultural neighborhood east of Montreal and has a national historic designation. 

Wentworth Park and Open Hearth Park are nice for walks have lots of panels with local history like you would see in Lunenburg. 

Hope you have a fun adventure!

"It's a nice house, nothing wrong with it, and it's pretty aggressively priced considering how the market looks like now.

I'm just saying, you can have a house or newish townhouse in Calgary for 350-500k depending on the neighborhood.

Here, there's a pretty wild range of what you get for your money at this pricepoint. If you downsize and net 100-200k from the sale, good, but there are most likely some costly upgrades or repairs to do in the lower-priced homes. There's a huge opportunity cost in moving here to also take in consideration.

I'm just pushing back against the idea that this place is the holy grail of cheap housing. It's not, really. You might be lucky to get something decent for 250k-ish, but these don't pop-up often anymore. And a LOT of houses at that price point and under needs a tremendous amount of work.

It's like there's no middle, either pick something from 1928 at 250k near the city center or pick a newish house in a good location that's most likely too big for a couple looking to downside at 400k.

Of course the  price is going to be bottom low if you  take the average of CBRM, housing in Glace Bay, or New Waterford are a steal.

"I'm what CBers call a 'Come From Away'. I've been here since 2002, and this is what I can tell you: Cape Bretoners are the friendliest people you will ever meet - until you decide to live here. Then you find out that you will never, ever 'belong' or come anywhere close to being accepted. And don't even think about finding a job (unless you were offered one as an inducement to move here OR you are related to your employer.) Your prospective employer will be pestered with 'Why couldn't you have given that job to a local?' Oh, don't get me wrong - CBers will be nice to your face. After all, they might need a favour sometime. Don't  be fooled.
I'm lucky to have made some good friends in my twenty years here, but none of them are CBers except for those who married CFAs. Even they agree on the experience that outsiders aren't welcome unless they can be used as a source of income. 
So my advice to anybody hoping to move here is 'don't!', but if you do, seek out other CFAs to socialise with.

"If you're not from Cape Breton I would really avoid the small towns around Sydney, like Glace Bay, New Waterford, Dominion, North Sydney, Sydney Mines, etc... Generally these towns are just families that have been there forever and never move away. And people don't want to move away, they grow up there with all their aunts, uncles, cousins, etc... and want to stay to be with their family and start their own. It's kind of a cultural thing and result of the economy, no one really moves to them. I suppose a few have recently with the housing bubble but I'm not sure they know what's in store for them lol.

Stick to Sydney, Sydney River, Coxheath, Westmount, Howie Centre and Sydney Forks, or smaller villages or stretches in between the towns where it's more of a semi-rural kind of thing, house surrounded by trees instead of in a neighbourhood.

Contrary to what some think (usually people that moved away years ago when the island was in the height of it's economic collapse) Sydney is actually a really nice town now, there are a ton of great restaurants, a lot of international students, craft coffee shops, cidery, local shops, beer gardens, farmers market, there is a waterfront boardwalk, duck ponds and walking trails all in walking distance of downtown.

Also keep in mind there is no traffic in Cape Breton, so whatever Google Maps tells you is how long it takes to drive somewhere. You can get an acre of land nearby to water within a 30 min drive for roughly the same price as a house in Sydney. I don't know if rural is what you are after, but I live in the Mira area, and there are beaches, hikes/trails, boating, kayaking, fishing, campgrounds, mountain biking, a wildlife park, etc... all practically in our backyard and it's still just under 30 minutes to drive to downtown Sydney and pretty much everything surrounding Sydney offers the same thing.",t2_8gvlmq0l,smoothies-for-me,0,1643474821.0,0,t1_huqjlrr,huqjlrr,True,Raptor0Smitty,t3_sf9uyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapeBreton/comments/sf9uyp/i_want_to_move_back_home_but_halifax_is_too/,I want to move back home but Halifax is too expensive.,/r/CapeBreton/comments/sf9uyp/i_want_to_move_back_home_but_halifax_is_too/huqjlrr/,11,r/CapeBreton,0,11
"The difference is convenience. North Sydney is quite a nice area but still a 15-20 min drive to the perks of Sydney. With that said, you won’t need to go far to get your essentials. I think NS has a Walmart and a basic mall with Canadian Tire. If you can live with driving 20 mins to the Mayflower Mall, Home Depot, chain restaurants and, most likely, work, then I’d pull the trigger in NS. I personally live about 20 mins from the closest village in Cape Breton and my property is dirt cheap. I value having a larger home with a garage, barn, woodland and fields.

"I'm from a small town outside of North Sydney.



Coming from alberta the commute is nothing. It takes me longer to drive from milwoods to the west end than it did for me to drive from north Sydney to Sydney. 



North Sydney has most of what you need. Liquod, cannabis, Wal mart, basic essentials. If you want something fancy like a chain resturant you will likely have to drive to Sydney. There's a lot of amazing local food around you tho, so take advantage. Betties, ebbies, munchies pizza, food trucks like ""stand and stuff your face"". Places I can't wait to visit when I come home for a visit.



Theres a couple pub style bars. Dukes place in Sydney mines is fun in a Friday night. Other than that any sort of club esque experience will need to be over Sydney. 


There's a lot of natural beauty and so many amazing spots to visit just close by. The fairy holes in New Campbellton, tabotvale Bridge, ingonish Beach, Mary Anne falls, so many more  you'll love it.

"We have a bungalow (that’s Cape Breton speak for “cottage”) in Northside East Bay, which is right beside Islandview. We lived there for two years when we first moved up to Cape Breton from Halifax. Congrats, it’s a beautiful spot to live!
The lake is absolutely beautiful for swimming!! We swim there every chance we get. Just keep in mind that the water takes a bit longer to warm up in the summer, because the Bras D’or lake is so large. There are also some jelly fish to watch out for, but they come and go (I would say I saw 6 total all last summer).  That part of the lake has a ton of these beautiful tiny purple and pink starfish. They’re awesome, if you can spot them. 
When we lived there the internet was very slow, however we moved out just before they installed the fibre op cables. It seems a lot faster and more reliable now.
As far as jobs, I’m not too sure about retail, but the Sydney Call Centre seems to be always looking to hire new people. Keep in mind that you are looking at a 25 minute drive, minimum, to get a job in retail or at a call centre.

"My wife works as a nurse. The health care system in Nova Scotia, especially on the island, is already overwhelmed from normal every day stuff. There aren’t enough doctors or nurses to take care of people even when there isn’t a pandemic. The number of people who die isn’t a very good statistic on the load experienced by a healthcare system. And people dying doesn’t matter to anyone until those deaths start to be people you know. Because everyone that dies has family. Everyone was a sibling, parent or child. I would gladly continue all of these restrictions if it meant that those families got to continue whole. 

Your left handed example is not a good comparison because covid can affect anyone. Just because they don’t die doesn’t mean that they aren’t increasing the load on the healthcare system. 

If there was no lockdown, there would be significantly more deaths than just 30,000. And to put that in perspective, Sydney has a population of slightly less than that as of 2016 (~29,900).

The bigger answer to your question is the provincial government - or Halifax. Nova Scotia has huge disaparity between Halifax and everywhere else, Cape Breton isn't alone in that regard.

I will say though in recent years there has been a change, downtown has been revitalized, no longer do we just have a subway and Smooth Hermans, now there are a dozen places to eat, craft coffee shops, farmers market, HAT, etc...

New fire dept, NSCC campus, construction at open hearth (not to mention Tar Ponds cleaned), new schools and healthcare centres in the process of being built in CBRM.

"Perhaps my perspective is different than yours. I am a career services professional and every day I interact with people who have plenty of drive, but no opportunity. Those government handouts are often (unironically) life or death for some people who are more than happy to work as hard as they possibly can to get by.

"It’s not so much about growth rather stability. Growth brings a wealth of opportunities for children, people, cultures, etc. Decline brings forward mental health cases, suicide, crime, and poverty. While I agree it’d be nice not to have to do either (decline or grow), the nature of community is that it’s always changing - in the face of competition with other communities, policy, government, private investment, etc.

So your comment tells me 1 of a few different scenarios: (1) you’re living somewhat isolated from the community and society, worrying about yourself and not having kids or relatives to which you care about, or (2) you’re living in the community and are in a safe/stable job nearing your retirement with a pension to which you have successful slid under the radar from ever challenging or pushing yourself hard, or (3) you might - and I say this respectfully - not be aware of some fundamental concepts about economics, sociology, etc. (like at the 101/102 level) — which is totally fine.

"Sydney is excellent, despite what a lot of your replies are saying. I am from here, lived away during university and then until my mid twenties but moved back 5 years ago and I will never move away again. There is certainly a lot of negativity around, but like anything it is what you make it. People can be miserable anywhere. I like it because it is home and there are a lot of small businesses opening up and bringing back the downtown/north end. New independent book store, restaurants/cafes, farmers market, craft breweries and cideries, etc. 

Saying all that, I would recommend you come visit the different places you are considering, preferably during the summer, and see why fits your life and interests best. I wouldn’t say that the job market and dating scene are overly vibrant in Sydney, but there are lots of great people here.

"I moved away from home a while ago, but I’m sure you know Sydney/Cape Breton has a pretty big drinking scene. I think moving there as an adult will be what you make of it.

Dating scene isn’t impossible, but it’s a little tough I’d say. People can be pretty clicky, but it would work in your favour if you get an in, befriend someone then get on to the group. There are lots of amazing people there.

Jobs can be tough as well. I’d say look at locking that in before you move are at least do a solid scoop to make sure there are jobs in your field.

"Ribs? Yeah they're good but Montana's got more choice, and of arguably better quality, for a lower price. If you really want ribs at that 'upper-end' restaurant price anyway, just go to the Lobster Pound or Black Spoon. These guys know what they are doing. They also have a comprehensive menu, albeit a little more expensive overall.

Hamburgers? Yeah...ordinary. Dry lukewarm bun with a skinny and dry patty. 'Braveheart burger' my ass. If you want a good heart-attack home-made style burger, go to Just In Thymes. You'll get the fattiest patty on the island, and it won't be dry.

Breakfast? Meh. Not bad, but basic and pricy. 7by7 got way more options for brunch.

I had their brisket sandwich at one point, picturing a Texas-like brisket right of the smoker, dripping with melted fat, with a slice so tender you could snap it with just a little tug. The disappointment I got instead was a dry as fuck, rubbery beef sandwich. No Quarter Deli sandwiches beats them so bad it's not even a fight.

Last time I went to the Gov I had a salmon wrap with chicken soup. They clearly microwaved that poor salmon. It was so dry, and some bites were really hot, some others really cold. And how neglecting do you have to be so that your chicken noodle soup barely tastes anything? I'd rather have a cup of Lipton chicken noodle, at least it would be 15cents for the powder, and it would be as salty as I was disappointed by my 20$+  meal. That was my last time I'd ever go there for a proper meal. You want a coffee with that? Yeah here's some specialty drip mop water.

Again, the beer garden and live music is nice...and if you just go there for a good time, you can enjoy some potato skins, wings, a good beer (LMAO they stopped serving Breton Brew. How petty...), and some live music. Although on that front, you can enjoy the outside at Portside, get some good beer and drinks, have some live music, AND get some good food. Apparently at that place it's not mutually exclusive.

If Gordon Ramsey was to ever set a foot in there you'd see some tables flip. Unfortunately, since it's so popular for some reason, it'll just continue to be Sydney's figurehead while offering sub-par quality.

Don't forget to stop to the Gift Shop next door owned by the same person on your way out! Some Cape Breton Coasters, T-Shirts, other 'local' crap made in India or china... Go Cape Breton....!
