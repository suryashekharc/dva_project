Missed Rico's but tbh figured they only focused on pizza so that's probably why.

Bergstorm doesn't do it. I've checked and been there before. They did it once  but that's it. I asked the owner to bring it back lol

Slabtown is grilled.

I don't see one on Oakwood's menu.

Bubba's is grilled

I need to see how J&S's one is like before ordering it, seems like a regular sandwich compared to just like a burger style chicken sandwich.

I'll definitely check these chicken sandwiches! Any more recommendations?

My point still stands on the breakfast chicken sandwiches though! Biscuit chicken sandwiches are like my favorite. After having biscuits from local places, I still prefer fast food biscuits for some reason.

Also those chains don't compare to CFA chicken sandwiches tbh.

Sorry, I'm a huge chicken sandwich lover and prefer it over burgers. Even a Popeyes chicken sandwich is better than the best burger I've had here for me (Bergstorm).",t2_8qx9z,thenerdal,0,1646838769.0,0,t1_hzzab1b,hzzab1b,False,Artistic_Floof,t3_ta7w1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/traversecity/comments/ta7w1z/guess_what_new_chain_restaurant_opened_to_create/,Guess what new chain restaurant opened to create this long line?

With gas prices rising, that seems way less worth than simply waiting in a long line (that goes pretty quick since CFA is pretty good at that.)

"Which is why I have no choice but to watch it rot. The culture is dead, so there's nothing to save, anyway.

""Embrace change"" is a meaningless platitude thrown around by hippies. It's a cope, not a solution. I could find that tagline on a mug at TJ Maxx. ""Embracing change"" isn't going to make the price of basic necessities go down. It's not going to lower taxes. It won't give me my home back. The town is now populated by people I cannot stand. The affluent pieces of shit who fled from downstate, and west coast political migrants who just want to make another Portland.

If you lived here, you'd know that this town can't grow. Well, it can't *afford* to grow. It's the most geographically unique place in the midwest, and that comes with EXTREME logistical problems. Transportation has been the primary infrastructure issue for this town for over a century. The streets can't get any wider. All the streets that could be built, have been. Any East-West travel in the town is impossible without some mongoloid trying to occupy the same point in space-time as you. They tore up the rail. There are no sidewalks. Whether you ride your bike to work like a guy with a DUI, or drive a car, you're getting to where you need to go at about the same time. If it's only going to get worse, then I'm just going to wait for my property value to peak, and dump the fuck out of it just like the other locals who abandoned town for a quick buck.

Maybe one day you'll understand that change is more often bad than it is good, and that small towns should stay small.

"I'm debating it, but I think I'm going to keep the land I have, and move about an hour out of the way.

The population has grown too much, and I absolutely hate being in asses-to-elbows situations, which is the case everywhere, now. Almost all of the original culture of the town is long gone, and has been replaced by ""Foodies"" who think that going to restaurants is a valid substitute for personality. We have homeless camps, now. We have muggings now. We have a particularly fucking insane hard drug issue now. None of that was a thing even 8 years ago. Going downtown is non-viable for any local, and is just there for the urbanites and tourists. Things cost too much, especially real estate. If you are an honest to god local, you aren't enjoying the festivities. You're working your life away in a dead-end service industry job, if you didn't have a rich husband to open up a shop for you on Front. Oh, and the taxes! Enjoy paying $12000 a year on a third of a fucking acre!

Basically, the problem with Traverse City can be summed up as such: ""You never see New Yorkers going to see the Statue of Liberty. It's not for us, it's for them."" I've had to endure ""it's for them"" rhetoric, regarding all facets of the local area, for at least the last 15 years I've lived here, and possibly longer, but it's also possible that I was paying less attention at the time.

They are tough as nails but I would say that multi media is definitely over emphasising this As well as making Russia look a lot weaker than they actually are which in my opinion is very stupid and very dangerous. I would also say the sanctions are the same way where they (russia and east cuz chinas with them hands down despite MSM claims) have more to hold over our head than we have to hold over theirs. I stand with Ukraine and I think Putin is a scumbag and I am very nervous about how all this is going... The US dollar as global reserve currency is about to fail and Putin and the East know it. What’s to stop China from taking Taiwan? Or which to stop Russia from taking any of the other non NATO countries in europe?

Pretty inspiring but looks like putin is Going to have his way in Ukraine if Biden doesn’t step in along with NATO which already said they aren’t gonna defend the airspace pretty much gift wrapping ukraine to putin along with any other non-NATO countries which he has his eyes on. this is really sad. Our leaders are really incompetent not that Trump was much better we need to get the central banks in the federal reserve who prints all of our money abolished And set up a sound money system that is backed by something and there’s not a fractional reserve system where the banks can print money out of thin air causing inflation which is the most regressive tax there is meaning it affects the poor and helps the wealthy. That’s why we advocate for sound money backed my gold or silver so thet cant print more if it and devalue the peoples savings.. Putin knows that the US dollar is failing as global reserve currency and we have printed way too much and that every fiat (money backed by nothing) since the beginning of time has gone to zero..

"The Tasting Room. 3 courses each and 1 dessert for two. 

First course: a pork belly bao for me and a salmon (or tuna?) tostada for partner, plus one mocktail since they don’t have (and I hear were rejected for) a liquor license. 

Bao was okay but inexplicably was deep-fried like a chalupa. Not what I wanted or expected but okay. 

Tostada was… like sushi that’s not bad but really getting questionable, very fishy. Both apps had the same sriracha mayo that I have in my fridge or could make in under a minute (or close enough to).

Second course, we both got French onion soup. It was serviceable, I make better at home. It suffered from the cheese kind of sitting inside the broth and getting goopy but felt actually homemade, not from a bag. The amount of thyme and what tasted like red wine/vermouth was well balanced. 

Third dish, a seafood risotto and a pulled short rib beef over gnocchi. The beef was okay but not very seasoned, gnocchi was good. My partner had to send back the risotto for being cold (mind you we’ve both been in the industry and have sent food back maybe twice each in our lives.) 

Partner asked if they could just reheat it for a couple minutes, they made it new instead. It was still pretty bad. The texture was good but the flavors were just off. We didn’t finish it and didn’t ask for a to-go box. 

Dessert, bananas foster… not what I’d expect but not bad, a pre-caramelized banana with brown sugar and vanilla bean ice cream.

Took a while to write it but it got denied so I shortened it and then that's when he messaged me.

I was originally going to be more harsh on Artisan since I didn't really like the first course since it tasted like ceviche on top of store bought guacamole. Since I tagged them in the original post, I thought I'd be nicer.

But he thought I was getting paid for the meals. I even said I'd provide proof of me actually spending the money.

I'm just a huge Foodie and I rarely go out to eat and want to give my thoughts if a place is worth or not.

"I did three restaurants!!! McGee’s, Stella and Artisan.

I loved McGee’s the most and thought the standout dish was the basic cookie and ice cream dessert haha, it's the least fanciest dish I've had from all three.

I didn't really like Artisan much tbh. Wasn't really worth it. We ordered extra things and spent about $250....

I have a reservation for Cooks house on Tuesday since they extended it but idk if I'll do it anymore since I already spent so much.

I regret doing Artisan and wish I went to Cooks House instead lol but my friend wanted the Toffee dessert from them. I got the fluffy cheesecake and it really wasn't that fluffy lol.

Although Agave is in Traverse, that place isn’t bad. Super cheesy, but the food is decent. La Senorita is good. Qdoba is fast food, but better than Mama Lu’s. 

(Edit, I think part of it was the quality to price ratio as well, it was just my wife and I, and after tip it was something ridiculous like $70+ dollars… for a few tacos and two margaritas.
