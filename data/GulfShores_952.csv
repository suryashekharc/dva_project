"> plus a pier license for fishing off of the pier.

To clarify, you have to have a regular saltwater license, pay to park and pay to walk out on the pier. So another $7 total(?) on top of your saltwater license. Unless you are a resident of Orange Beach and have the parking pass for the state park.

License costs and size regulations:
https://www.outdooralabama.com/fishing/saltwater-recreational-size-creel-limits

And one more thing. Certain species require a reef fish endorsement. It's kind of hard to find that info, as it's not linked in the licensing section. And the problem is that you can catch mangrove snappers along the seawalls and such. So it is not just for fishing from a boat. 

So if you saltwater fishing and want to keep grey (mangrove) snappers, then you must purchase the reef endorsement too.

"Good God, this info was hard to find last spring. I called and spoke to multiple people at the AL DNR and no one really knew. I was told to contact the State Park as well, but I was miffed that the DNR couldn't definitively say. 

But then I stumbled upon this while looking up the park's office number. From [the state park site](https://www.alapark.com/parks/gulf-state-park/fishing):

> You must purchase a saltwater or freshwater license before you begin fishing. You can purchase them online. The three lakes at the Park are classified as freshwater and the Pier is classified as saltwater. You're AL fishing license must reflect these distinctions.
>     
> There is a $5.00 fee to launch a boat from Middle Lake and Lake Shelby ramps.
    

So you must have a freshwater license for the lakes (and I would assume the canals between the lakes as well) in the park. And a saltwater for the beach and pier, plus a pier license for fishing off of the pier.

"This is something you could get 10 different answers from 10 different people but usually...

Inshore is considered fishing the bays, lagoons and rivers that feed into the gulf. 

Shore/Surf Fishing is considered fishing from the beach or a pier on the beach out into the surf 

Offshore is anytime you go out into the gulf and fish the deep reefs.

There is a youtube channel of a local guy [Bama Saltwater](https://www.youtube.com/c/bamasaltwater) who has some great videos on all three and what to use as bait and gear for better success. Search through his videos and give them a look. He will put you on some fish if you take his tips.

"The age restriction policy used to frustrate me so much, I married young and my wife and I could rarely find places that would rent to us, Luckily, I was 25 before we started vacationing with our kids...

All that to say, I feel your pain. Unfortunately, **I think the age restriction policy is set by insurance providers, not necessarily the renters/rental agencies.**

You might be able to call and speak with some of the agencies, or as /u/whitepepper mentioned, individual owners, to get around the policy. But I would not hold my breath, unless you have a young married couple in the party. They might rent to them.

Check VRBO or maybe AirBnB. You could also try something like RVShare (there are other services as well). These are usually owners that will deliver and set up their RV for you to use. But you have to pay for the site and the RV.

There are a couple hotels on the beach that may not have the 25 deal in place as they are big chains.

On 59 there are several too but not on the island so you'd want bikes possibly to get to the beach unless you are fine payin the parking fees.

"Local here -- go to Flora-Bama. It's really fun for a night of drinking and dancing. Also, across the street is Flora-Bama Yacht Club. The food is great and it's more conducive for a sit-down meal during the day. And it's on the bay so you can actually get in the water there. I would say 75% of the time I've been to the Yacht Club, I see dolphins too.

If you have the money to spend RENT A BOAT! Especially if you have a big group with you, going in the bay is a lot of fun if you have some extra money to blow. There are islands you can park on to get out and swim. If you're out on the boat for hours, you'll most likely see dolphins at some point. Plus, it's cool to see the houses on Ono Island. If you do rent a boat, go to Pirates Cove, they have good food and great bushwhackers (the Flora-Bama ones are great, too).

"Just casual observation, but the real money has always seemed to be in OB. I've always looked at OB as the ""snobbish"" and ""elite"" side of the coast, which is happy to suckle at the teat of the tourism cow that is GS... as long as those rednecks stay on their side of the State Park.

And Kennon threw around some blatant disregard:

> ""“The city of Orange Beach adamantly opposes that bridge to the west. Anything Gulf Shores wants to do with their roadways we support them. But they should pay for them. Not the state of Alabama taxpayers.’’""

So, GS taxpayers are not Alabama taxpayers? Interesting. Especially considering:

> ""Gulf Shores, a city with twice the population and half the collections in ad valorem taxes, is growing even faster than Orange Beach.""

You do have to pay for entry at the pier as well as have a current saltwater fishing license or pier fishing license. The pier fishing license is usually the cheaper option but only covers man made piers. The saltwater fishing license covers that and everything else. You need the saltwater license to fish from the beach. I believe the pier fishing license can only be purchased annually where as the saltwater license can be purchased on a shorter trip basis. All annual licenses expire August 31st no matter the date of purchase. If you have more questions you can call Alabama Marine Resources or speak to the staff at the gulf state pier for more clarification.

"I lived in GS for four years and this is precisely what I was looking for the entire time.

It’s hard to find this kind place.
Some of my husband and I’s fav places there come close though so here are some of the spots we found that are/were close...
1) Big Beach Brewing Canal Rd just between orange beach and GS
2)The Hangout is a trap but they really do have great food and drinks and I took my 21 y/o niece and her girls there and they loved it. 
Timing is everything with The Hangout, but forgive them this as they truly host the last great music festival in the states.
Hangout Festival is beyond compare.
3)The Pink Pony Pub right to the left of the Hangout and right on the water.
Fun staff, cheap drinks, and an excellent location.
4) And of course NOTHING competes with the shitshow that is 
The Florabama Lounge/Pub/Bar
They are OG and there is something for everyone.
It’s a bit of a drive, and, like The Hangout TIMING is so important. 
Sometimes it’s dead as hell or filled with old people, and other times like late in the evening it’s just a shit kicking good time and crazy as hell.

"To add to /u/falingodingo's post... That's my happy place, also known as the [Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Bon_Secour/). Take some water, your umbrellas, and chairs and make a day of it. Or better yet spend an afternoon into the evening. There are not very many people, the views are amazing, and the wildlife is surprising. And you will love it. Fishing is also pretty good in this area. Just know that there are no bathrooms on or near the beach, so keep that in mind.

Seriously, go out there at about 2 or 3 pm and stay to watch the sunset. We did that twice last summer and all 15 people we could see, including the children, just turned and watched the sun drop into the ocean. Enchanting.

The Beach House - happy hour specials

"I have been researching this for a few years now, as I still plan on buying a rental property in the area. 

Obligatory IANAL nor a real estate agent. 

Some things that I would add to that list:

1. Confirm the HOA insurance coverage, then potentially add your own:  
     * Homeowners Insurance
     * Wind Insurance
     * Liability Insurance (for the renters)
     * Possibly a separate fire policy

1. I see most property management fees passed on to the renters themselves, just like the cleaning fee is.
 
1. The rental market will depend on the size (BR/BA), location, and styling of the condo. Many of the properties are already used for rental and the seller or agent should be able to get you a breakdown of the rental history. I would always seek this info out, if you are planning on using it as a vacation rental.
 
1. Personal usage. You own it. It's yours. Tell the management company what weeks that you will not be renting it. Or manage it yourself... though that takes some effort.
 
1. Lastly, I would even consider creating an LLC to own the property, sop in the case of an extreme issue (with a guest, HOA, etc.) you personally are not on the hook for liability or other damages. Protect your personal finances buy separating the rental away from you legally.",t2_4x1v7,the_rogue1,0,1618851338.0,0,t1_gv3n0xv,gv3n0xv,True,girlyawkward,t3_mltjgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GulfShores/comments/mltjgv/tell_me_about_condo_ownership/,Tell me about condo ownership!,/r/GulfShores/comments/mltjgv/tell_me_about_condo_ownership/gv3n0xv/,3,r/GulfShores,0,3
"I'm going down the first week of May, so I'll try to remember to give feedback.

From what I know, most businesses have recovered, or at least are open. Rental agencies always hedge their warning about the availability of amenities, because problems pop-up, or some condo associations decide that something needs fixed right now (or they can get it done at that time). So it may be a bit of a crapshoot this summer. (I doubt it though. Unless the HOA has money or leadership problems, I would expect most of the major amenities have already been repaired.)

As for your stay... 6 nights is a bit harder to book during peak season, as most are only rented Saturday to Saturday or Sunday to Sunday for 7 nights. 

For the past several years, I have stayed the Saturday before Memorial Day until the following Saturday. So I have a good idea of what the traffic and crowds are like.

"Right off, your dates are Sunday-Sunday. The majority of rentals in the GS area are Sat.-Sat. 

Just a quick breeze through VRBO shows no places available for 40 people on those dates. Switching to 7/10-7/17 brings up a handful, all of which appear to be on the beach, or just across the street - meaning expensive.

It looks like there are more options if you reduce the total number of people to 30. And you should be able to find more places that would fit 20, though you would have to rent two of them.

Renting out both sides of a duplex may be your best bet. Or looking at a motel. If you really don't care about the beach aspect, look north a bit, in the Foley area. (I assume you'll be playing at one of the sports complexes, so Foley is a definite option.)

[Back Bay Charters](https://www.backbaycharters.net/) this is a private charter boat that does dolphin & sunset cruises, bars, beaches, island adventures, & Family Fun Fishing. It's perfect for any time, but especially during COVID as you are the only family on board. I think he can take up to 8 people (but you should check that). He is out of Zeke's Marina in OB & really a great guide even if you are a local.

"Welcome! Hope you brought some warm clothes for this weekend - BRRR!! 

If you don't mind the cold, Gulf Shores State Park is a great place to explore - walking, biking, kayaking, etc. There is also the Bon Secour Wildlife Preserve, Fort Morgan and of course, the beautiful sandy beaches. If you enjoy fishing, it should be a good weekend to snag some Whiting, Sheepshead or Reds.

"We moved to Foley from central Texas just over 3 years ago, and have never been happier.  There's lots to love here.  We're less than 10 miles to beaches in Gulf Shores. It takes longer to pack the car then it does to drive to the beach.  And after hurricane Sally, I like the buffer.  In addition to our beautiful beaches, we have walking trails, fresh seafood, great restaurants, and lots of entertainment and ways to entertain yourself.  

Summers are hot and humid, but not as hot as central Texas, The climate is more temperate here than there.  Not as cold in the winter either.  It rains a lot.  (It's raining right now). Over 60 inches a year, so plan on mowing the lawn regularly.  But the rain makes the countryside green and lush and pretty.

Traffic during tourist season is the downside, and can get intense.  We've seen traffic backed up on southbound 59 at County Road 8.  We rarely try going to the beaches during tourist season, unless we're entertaining visiting family / friends.  Tourists and Snowbirds are the lifeblood of the area.  It wouldn't be the way it is without them.  We'll go to the beach the other 9 months of the year.

We're retired and can't speak about schools and work, but I can tell you for sure, we love it here.",t2_t9m0r,hangingloose,0,1607818481.0,0,t1_gfm3tor,gfm3tor,True,CanvasLady,t3_kahdbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GulfShores/comments/kahdbn/moving_tonear_gs/,Moving to/near GS,/r/GulfShores/comments/kahdbn/moving_tonear_gs/gfm3tor/,1,r/GulfShores,0,1
"I’d look in to Elberta, Foley, Bon Secour, and Gulf Shores. If you’re in to more country life with larger yards I’d lean towards Elberta which is growing very fast and is a great place to be close to the beach without dealing with tourists daily. Foley is the the most central but can be traffic heavy since major shopping is located there. Bon Secour is West of Foley and has some very cool spots on the river. There are a ton of schools around and if you find a job outside of Gulf Shores City Schools, you might prefer Elberta or Foley as you’ll have a closer commute.

For us, fresh seafood really depends on where we are staying. If around West Beach Blvd, we'll pick up our seafood from [S&S Seafood](https://www.obawebsite.com/local/ss-seafood-market), but I believe it is closed for the season. 

If out in East Beach, or OB, we'll go to [Lartigue's](http://lartigueseafood.com/menu.asp). 

When staying out in Fort Morgan, there is a little shop next to the Dollar General that I have used as well.

And if I am feeling really froggy, I'll drive out to Bon Secour and go to [Billy's Seafood](https://www.billys-seafood.com/) or [Anguila Seafood](https://www.aquilaseafood.net/).

As for local specialties? Well, I have a list of places that I like to eat certain things from, but when I am cooking for myself, I keep it fairly simple.

"I almost always post up right on the beach, behind wherever I am staying. Usually easy to do in the early morning and sometimes even later in the evening. Middle of the day sucks the further into tourist season you get. I will also go out to the Bon Secour National Wildlife refuge when the crowds are too much on the beaches. (That's where Bama Beach Bum fished a lot.)

As for what to look for... sandbars, cuts, runs, troughs/guts, washouts, bait fish, etc. Sometimes depends on what you are targeting as well. I hate Pinterest, but this is one decent representation you can use:
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/488077678335993464/visual-search/

For more pictures, just search for ""surf fishing read the beach"" or similar.

BBB has a couple where he talks specifically about reading the surf, but I think this one is the best he's done so far:

"Depends on what you like to do. All my favorite activities are outdoor like the beach, the state park, etc but there are plenty of options. Off the top of my head:

There is OWA (amusement park meets shopping) and the Tanger outlet mall in Foley which is just north of Gulf Shores. Both are open air but easy to stay under cover when needed. 

The Wharf is similar - shopping with mostly covered walkways located in Orange Beach. I haven’t been there in ages though so not sure what’s there. 

There’s arcades sprinkled around the area too, and a bowling alley In Foley that has those rails over the gutters for the kiddos if there are some older ones in your group. 

On that note if there are kids a little older Urban Air is an indoor bouncy house trampoline place they might enjoy in Spanish Fort, about 40 minutes to the north. 

The museum at the naval air station in Pensacola is amazing and only about an hour away.  It’s a great place to spend a day even with little ones. 

Not for the kids, but there are two axe throwing places (one in Pensacola and one in Fairhope) if the adults get really stir crazy. Lol.

Yeah I understand your concern. There are plenty of places with big enough gaps to set up and still be close enough without obstructing the view of others while also not obstructing your own view. I was mostly just saying that I’ve never heard of any of the employees of Ike’s saying anything like that to anybody,t2_3j2nh8p8,Parallaaxx,0,1563293640.0,0,t1_etx83xx,etx83xx,False,Jessjay_22,t3_cds9t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GulfShores/comments/cds9t6/the_beach_chair_services/,The beach chair services...,/r/GulfShores/comments/cds9t6/the_beach_chair_services/etx83xx/,1,r/GulfShores,0,1
"I understand that people wouldn't want to pay for chairs, then have someone in front of them. I'm paying a pretty penny for my stay & have spent money on nice chairs & an umbrella of my own, so I don't want anyone in front of me either. That's why I don't want to be told that I have to sit behind empty chairs. I want to be away from people anyway, so (at other placed I've stayed) I'm able to find a gap between the groups of chairs & sit closer to the water, while in the gap - getting at least 15+ feet from anyone else. That way, if anyone eventually rents the chairs, I'm still not directly in front of them.

&#x200B;

I guess my concern lies more with the set up and the actual rights of the company. If I were to go down to the beach early & it's completely lined with empty chairs & no gaps, it's not really fair to tell me to sit behind them. As I said, I would try to find a gap. If there aren't any, it would be extremely unfair for someone to tell me I have to move behind empty chairs, just because they want to ""save a seat"" for someone who might eventually rent them.",t2_xl4av,Jessjay_22,0,1563289771.0,0,t1_etx25om,etx25om,False,Jessjay_22,t3_cds9t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GulfShores/comments/cds9t6/the_beach_chair_services/,The beach chair services...,/r/GulfShores/comments/cds9t6/the_beach_chair_services/etx25om/,1,r/GulfShores,0,1
I know multiple people that work for Ike’s and have lived here for 20 years and have never heard of them doing anything like that. However they do have permits from the city that they are allowed to set their chairs up and you are able to rent them. Also you have to realize that their job is to rent those chairs out to people and that would be harder to do if the chairs they are trying to rent have an obstructed view. Why would anyone want to rent a chair if all they’re gonna see is the back of someone’s head?

There are a few good indoor activities in gulf shores. There are a few escape rooms. My favorite escape room is XIT escape room in the pelican place mall right near target. Waterville also has 2 escape rooms as well as an arcade. There is a trampoline park called the factory that is perfect if you have younger kids or teens. There is owa which is a new amusement park in foley right off of county road 20 and beach express. They just opened an indoor video game arena which could be fun but I have not been to it. They also have a few other indoor things to do as well as a theatre they just opened (broadway style theater I guess is what it would be called? It’s not movies but actual people on a stage acting.) and the last thing I would recommend is the beach because even though the forecast says it’s gonna rain the forecast has also said it was supposed to rain almost everyday this week and the most we have gotten has been barely a drizzle.
