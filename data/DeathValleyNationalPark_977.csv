"I also explored Chloride City from Hwy 95 several days after I took the Keane Spring hike. You can also reach Chloride City/Cliff from what is called The Monarch Canyon Road which passes between The Keane Spring and the Monarch Mine on the way to Chloride. 

Access to Monarch Canyon Road traveling eastbound on Daylight Pass Pass Road is the second dirt road on your right. The first dirt road is a service road to a gravel pit and dead ends. Take the second one which is just a short distance past the first. 

While at Chloride I had two motorcyclist tell me that Monarch Canyon Road gets pretty technical approaching Chloride City so you may need a solid 4x4 per their report. I did not personally drive that section due to their advice and thus returned back to Hwy 95 rather than do the loop from Hwy 95 to Daylight Pass Road as I had originally planned because I was only driving my Subaru Crosstrek.

"Happy to help! I've visited all the dune fields in the park (I think), and they do actually each have their own character. Mesquite Flat is the largest field by area. Very pretty, but also the easiest to reach and thus by far the most popular. However, as you've said, once you're 1/2 mile past the parking lot you're leaving 80% of the people behind. Time of day also matters -  if you manage to get up early enough and hit them first thing in the morning you can pretty much have them to yourself :) Easy to do if you're staying at Stovepipe Wells.

Eureka Dunes are the highest and also have some unique plant life. Beautiful, but it's a long drive out! Also, don't expect to be alone there, they've gotten quite popular as far as backcountry destinations go. Panamint Dunes are another option - much less traffic than the Mesquite Dunes or even the Eureka Dunes. However, the access road there can have some large dips so you'll need to check the clearance of your rental car.",t2_6k62wmlu,Dr_DaBo,0,1647221611.0,0,t1_i0kc86m,i0kc86m,False,Vegetable-Purchase,t3_tdh037,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/tdh037/upcoming_dv_trip_hiking_questions/,Upcoming DV trip- hiking questions,/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/tdh037/upcoming_dv_trip_hiking_questions/i0kc86m/,1,r/DeathValleyNP,0,1

The dunes are awesome, but extremely tiring to climb. It was also windy while I was there and I kept getting sand blasted in the face. It‚Äôs a full days adventure, don‚Äôt underestimate the drive and be prepared to climb very high sand mountains.

"Telescope Peak: Will likely have a lot of snow still, so crampons and ice axe are strongly advised. If you're not quite up for Telescope Peak you can try Wildrose Peak from the Charcoal Kilns instead, it's also a fantastic hike.

Darwin Falls: You might not necessarily be alone there, but I wouldn't consider it crowded. I'd definitely add it to the list if you're looking for biodiversity, it's quite pretty!

For other options, check out Salt Creek trail (look for the pupfish!). The main trail can be busy, but there's an obvious dirt trail that you can follow further out along Salt Creek from the end of the boardwalk where virtually no one ever goes. It's a great area to explore if you're interested in wildlife.

With a rental car, Eureka Dunes is probably the most iffy. The roads are not technically difficult, but it's many miles over potentially badly washboarded roads. Note that typical rental car insurance doesn't cover off-pavement driving. Also, they usually don't come with a full spare tire anymore, and the emergency spares are useless on Death Valley dirt roads.",t2_6k62wmlu,Dr_DaBo,0,1647209988.0,0,t1_i0jn1u8,i0jn1u8,True,Vegetable-Purchase,t3_tdh037,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/tdh037/upcoming_dv_trip_hiking_questions/,Upcoming DV trip- hiking questions,/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/tdh037/upcoming_dv_trip_hiking_questions/i0jn1u8/,5,r/DeathValleyNP,0,5

About Star Wars in DEVA. Take your laptop, iPad, or device with the images of the Star Wars scenes and try to put yourselves in the exact same locations and snap photos. Make home movies of the scenes transposed over the vintage shots. This will keep the fun memories alive forever.

No‚Ä¶ Those areas are no camping except for established campgrounds. To disperse camp you have to be at least one mile from a paved road or any ‚Äúday use‚Äù area. The most popular dispersed camping is off of Echo Canyon Road since it‚Äôs right in the center of the action‚Ä¶ so to speak.

"Overall it's doable if you don't mind driving.

For Fall/Titus canyon I assume you mean driving up to the canyon mouth from Scotty's Castle Road. Doing the whole road is iffy in a rental car, and you need at least high clearance.  Agree with others that Ubehebe Crater may not be worth the long drive out there in and of itself. In that area I'd pick Keane Wonder Mine instead (2-mile dirt road out there, but should be OK in a car if you drive carefully). Also agree that Rhyolite is worth checking out if you're in Beatty.

Day 3 you might consider going up Wildrose Canyon Road to the charcoal kilns, and maybe hike up from there to Wildrose Peak - great hike depending on your definition of ""moderate"". That'll take the better part of the day though. From there you can go down Emigrant Canyon road (check if it's open first) and drive to Ridgecrest via Trona. That would bypass Darwin Falls though. 

If you're in Ridgecrest I'd pick the Trona Pinnacles over Fossil Falls for sunset. Great sunset location. They're pretty much on the way if you're driving through Trona, otherwise it's a 45-min drive from Ridgecrest. It's a 5-mile dirt road out there - usually doable in a car but high-clearance might be good.

"Day 1 you can definitely do Zabriskie Point, Mesquite Dunes, and Golden Canyon in a day. You might even be able to do the artists drive/palette (the very best time for this is to get to the palette about 20 minutes before sunset. Bring a headlamp just in case you need it to hike out after dark. You can watch the stars come out over Badwater Basin, it‚Äôs kind of cool to walk around there after sunset. Star watching from both Zabriskie Point and Dante‚Äôs View is really great. 

I highly recommend going to the craters at the beginning of Day 2. You can hike all the way around them, I think it would take an hour or more. Fall Canyon, Mosaic Canyon, and Titus Canyon are all on unpaved roads, which you aren‚Äôt going to want to do in your rental. There is very little if any service, so you don‚Äôt want to blow a tire in your rental out there.  You can drive up Emigrant Canyon Road to Wildrose Canyon Road to the kilns. The last 3 miles up to the kilns is unpaved gravel, but it‚Äôs totally a worthwhile hike up.  The kilns are pretty cool. It‚Äôs crazy to think people lived and worked way out there! 

Since you‚Äôre spending the night in Beatty make sure you take the detour to Rhyolite (a real ghost town) and the Goldwell Outdoor Museum. You will drive by it going to and from Beatty.  There are no real grocery stores in Beatty. There‚Äôs a Denny‚Äôs, a diner called Gema‚Äôs, Death Valley Coffee (go here!! Decent options for breakfast!) and some jerky places. If you Google grocery store Beatty you‚Äôll get the Dollar General. If you require other foods you should consider bringing it with you. Panamint does not have a grocery either. Shoshone has a real grocery store, and that‚Äôs out the south side of the park, which is paved and looks like it goes through a nice mountain pass. I haven‚Äôt been to that part of the park yet, maybe next time!

"Personally, I‚Äôd cut this back simply because the amount of driving and rushing about you will have to do will take away from the fun. But that‚Äôs a personal preference.

"In reality, these animals have been living here for over 100 years since they were abandoned by miners all across this region. They are everywhere and doing very well. Their coats are good, teeth are healthy, they are fat and happy. These are intelligent animals and not anything like Bison as far as defending their territory. If they want nothing to do with you , they simply walk away and many do just that. I don't go to them, they come to me. When I park my bus along the Wildrose Trona Rd. they just show up. They are not pushy, aggressive or rude. They are social animals. I even spoke to a Park Ranger about feeding them and his only advise came in the form of humor when he said, just don't walk away from them with a carrot in your back pocket. I don't feed them inside the National Park. I usually camp on BLM land whenever possible wherever I wander and there is no 'law' I am violating by feeding them. There is no harm to the animals as they forage just fine all year round and have been doing so for, again, over 100 years. Invasive, sure, they were brought there and didn't occur naturally but they coexist very well within the nature of this area and are even beneficial to this region. 3500 years ago (just a second ago in geologic terms) much of this area was still under water, even Death Valley proper, to the tune of up to 900 feet of water and the environment was entirely different. Much of the loss of water in this region was due to another invasive species...man. Today these animals forage, break-up the crusty soil, fertilize the soil and actually help the environment around them in an entirely natural manner. I enjoy them and they enjoy me and there is no harm.

"I typed in my reply ""this past December 2021"".  You have to pay for the shower at the hotel check in, they give you a plastic pass card to get past the locked pool gate. A towel is provided but no soap or shampoo, bring your own. If it's a cold windy day/night you can get chilled after stepping out of the shower because there is no door (it's a walk around entrance for privacy and modesty) and they leave to the two ventilating windows open all year round. One time while there in the winter I actually closed both of the windows in an attempt to preserve some warmth). Sometimes you have to wait your turn for five or ten minutes if it's busy and if it's really busy they actually run out of hot water. If so, go get your money back. Sometimes the floor is quite sandy and dirty from the wind blowing in  sand and from dirty shoes and boots. They do have two sinks with mirrors but only one toilet and one urinal.  One plus is that the large swimming pool is usually a pleasant swim in the no-chlorine naturally warm water from the nearby Travertine Springs. It's not hot but I guess in the high 70 or low 80 degrees.

"I've been all the way to the end of Lake Hill Road five times in several vehicles. I now own a Subaru Crosstrek (have not yet driven the Crosstrek out there yet) and would not hesitate to drive the road again with my Subaru. However I'd take a sturdy shovel just in case because the road crosses multiple small washes-gulleys that can develop firm lips (pun intended) up to a foot or more in height after rainstorms. Usually the bigger trucks and 4x4s tend to flatten these lips out over time.

So it's a matter of luck and timing as to how smooth your ride will be. That's why I recommend taking a shovel because if you do hit a high lip it's a quick and easy dig to continue on. It's a fun drive at night because of the shadows. There are heaps of places to car camp once you're a mile in.

Even at night be sure to notice the two old junk car carcasses on the west side of the road about a quarter mile or so into the drive. They look spooky with your headlights shining on them. Scaling Lake Mountain is easy and awards one with unusual views of The Panamint Dunes, Panamint Butte, Rainbow Canyon's mouth, South Pass, Telescope Peak and Argus Range Mountains. One might be able to see to the west the tip of Cerro Gordo in the Inyo Mountains?

If you're lucky you'll get buzzed by low flying military aircraft on training zooming down from Rainbow Canyon and the South Pass.

It's not well known but the Panamint Valley dry lake bed immediately west of Lake Mountain contains sailing stones and tracks similar to ones at The Racetrack but smaller. Here's a video I took of the phenomenon while hiking a 360 around Lake Mountain in 2017.

"So I actually JUST got home, a 5 hour trip turned into 10 hours because of weather. We caught some really nasty 30+ mph winds in Death Valley and had to pull over for a while due to lack of visibility, then I hit snow on my way home, and thunderstorms, oh and I got plenty of sun, I think I hit all the seasons! Lol. Anyways! So the trip was great! We got there Sunday around 7 am, first stop was the dunes, spent about 30 min walking around there, then from there we went to bad water basin, and visited artists drive and then golden canyon for a quick hike since it‚Äôs all on the same road. We stopped at Furnace creek to visit the ranger station, pay the fee, get a physical map which I highly recommend. Also I highly recommend downloading the offline map of that area on google maps , and downloading the national park service app and downloading the offline data for Death Valley it was a HUGE help finding locations. We camped at mesquite springs we got there around 2 and there was plenty of spots , really nice chill area but it got very windy in the afternoon /night time. Now for the fun part, gas, I suggest getting gas every chance you get, I probably topped off like 7 times because I didn‚Äôt want to risk running low , Death Valley is lots of driving around!! I drove 700 miles this weekend just to Death Valley, exploring and going home. 
So for gas I recommend stovewell pipes , save it as a location the gas is 5.16 from what I remember 87 only , there‚Äôs another gas station in the park but it‚Äôs in the high 7s , which I made sure I avoided at all costs. Wild life didn‚Äôt see any, bring warm clothes, plenty of water !

"I took this route from The Racetrack to Saline Valley in a rented standard pickup truck.

"I do hope you make it out there some day because I'd love to see what images you'll come up. Also the sand has a different texture from the other Death Valley Dune field in that hiking to the highest dune takes about twice if not more energy and effort than the one at Mesquite Sand Dunes. You sink in more and your feet are harder to pull out and the sand slides easier. You'll notice right off the bat especially hiking on the ridge lines. 

Many people find this park Facebook page devoted to current road conditions and warnings most useful: [https://www.facebook.com/DeathValleyRoadConditions/](https://www.facebook.com/DeathValleyRoadConditions/)

"I'm glad you posted this here because I missed it on your Instagram. Fun to watch and I'm guessing that you triggered the sand slide. I love how you compose your images and the fine touches you add to your craft. 

BTW some day you must make it out to the Eureka Dunes which actually emit a low but powerful sound they call the ""Singing Dunes.""

1. Not sure what camera you used but the video seemed a bit grainy and not as clear and crisp as most HD versions now on YouTube. The colors didn't snap like most current YT videos so I'm confused. 
2. Sound tracks were short and matched each scene clip which seemed a bit disjointed for my taste. The music mood matched the scenes well however. 
3. The video was about 30 minutes long which is ok if the viewer can maintain concentration that long but I bet that most viewers wont.  Would have preferred splicing down the driving sequences by at least half. The stop and explore shots don't need to be reduced that much.

"I personally prefer mesquite springs, although it's a little far from most of the attractions. The allure of it to me is it feels more like a campsite than other popular locations (stovepipe wells, etc) that, to me, feel more like parking lot camping. 

For easy/touristy stuff that doesn't require a lot of hiking or driving off main hwy, the main spots for you will probably be Zabriskie Point, Bad water Basin, and Mesquite Sand Dunes. 

If you end up camping up by Mesquite Springs, Uehebe Crater is up there too and definitely worth checking out (imo its worth checking out regardless of where you stay in the park). 

I've only tent camped there, so I don't have any feedback to offer as it relates to other lodging unfortunately.

"Some offhand thoughts -

The playa is underlain by really fine clay and silt which gets buoyant and floats around with very little energy/flow. 

The mudcracks on the playa are really deep, in places they‚Äôre several feet deep and several inches wide. I imagine that, early in the storm, they control the flow and act as little channels. 

Suppose scour in those cracks/channels erodes some sediment so now you have it suspended in the flow/water column. 

The storm is big enough that the playa is totally flooded. As the water stills and infiltrates (slowly) through the clay and the water level drops below the top of the salt, all that suspended sediment is laid down. Now the playa is brown?

Easily tested hypothesis there - can you dig through it and expose the salt again?

They used to be this guy named Steve Hall, he had a website that is now offline panamintcity.com, which is also excluded from the wayback machine on archive.org, that had the most absurdly complete compilation of all kinds of hikes and investigations of previously unknown slot canyons and natural arches in death valley, he has a YouTube page and a video that won an award. The website went offline and as far as I'm aware people have been searching for HTML or simple text of it since then

"Not surprised about Lippincott Pass driving scene but since you had no scenes of The Racetrack or Grandstand I wrongly assumed how you drove to Eureka. You really covered heaps of territory going from Ibex to Eureka. I appreciate your effort to hit the top of the dunes (Mesquite or Ibex?) at sunrise because the light is so magic. I go out of my way to time my hikes to hit the sweet spots of sunrise/sunset but reality is that some shots just have to be taken at noon. I love the winter days light. 

I still struggle with capturing the best pan pace/speed because I don't want to bore the viewer but then if too fast the details are missed. One suggestion on dune and mountain ridge shots is to go from close up near your feet, follow the ridge line as you zoom out into the panorama mode. I love this effect because it pulls you right into the scene. 

For example here's one of the Ibex Dunes 2018, you may enjoy as my amateur attempt with some of these suggestions. I don't even pretend to be a pro videographer (as evidenced by my lack of steady cam skills. LOL)

"I love your video and watched it twice. Here's why: 1. micro and macro shots mix kept my interest 2, fast mode and normal mode kept video pace engaging 3. contrast scenes from snowy roads to warm spring and palm trees reveal Death Valley's diversity. 4. demonstrating how much of a slog it is to scale the Eureka Dune field. (It's like swimming in quick sand.) 5. driving sequences were short and without too much hood blocking views, showed closeup of road shoulder in foreground with focal point being horizon adding a sense of travel (love this effect) 6. shadow walking adds a personal and perspective touch I find engaging without the boredom of selfie-face shots. 7. use of captions rather than dialog allows the scenes to speak for themselves (but I liked your breathless selfie narration at the top of the Eureka Dunes which matched the mist rising from the dunes as the sun heated them up. 8 can't go wrong with mud crack shots - love them. 

The length of your video was about right although I enjoyed it so much I didn't want it to end and if the same quality content continued I could have watched it twice as long. I found the soundtrack a bit distracting and jarring and would have preferred one that was as good at blending as was your scene selection. It's a pain but you might add time stamps in the video description of where the scenes were shot. 

From your video scenes I bet you started at Zabriskie Point, stopped by Mesquite Dunes, headed west on Highway 190 and cut north over South Pass, down into Saline Valley and then through Steel  Pass to Eureka Dunes? Your vehicle seems well suited for this route.

We were up there in the morning, so the snow around Red Pass was hanging onto the hillside but except for some icy patches, the road was clear. I‚Äôd imagine later in the day it could get a little muddy and slippery so be careful coming down from the pass. Even though the entire road has been graded, I‚Äôd say you still need a high-clearance vehicle as ruts, rocks and berms are prominent. It really is amazing how different the road is from when I ran it in November. A lot of loose rock washed down into the slot canyon, my favorite area, and it has been pushed out of the way for the most part. The roadbed is looser than normal though, so pay attention. The small drop area has returned so keep it slow. Honestly, I think the 3 mile 2-way section from the parking lot to the road is the roughest part of the drive!",t2_4dk2rep6,ramillerf1,0,1641689132.0,0,t1_hrulu7l,hrulu7l,True,ramillerf1,t3_rxwh3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/rxwh3k/titus_canyon_has_reopened_today_after_being_shut/,Titus Canyon has reopened today after being shut down since the recent storm.

As for the map, I shrunk down the scale of the park a bit, to about 1:30, I think it was actually closer to 1:17 scale in the screenshot. Also managed to get a bunch of elevation data that allowed me to get much more of the park. I hope to eventually get a few major landmarks and put the map up for download to let people explore Death Valley virtually. Atm I have as far north as Mesquite Springs Campground, and as far south as Baker.

"Can‚Äôt tell you about restaurants, but as long as you get out early for the super popular hikes, Golden Canyon, Natural Bridges, and the like, you should be fine people wise. If you want to avoid crowds, go to places like marble/cottonwood canyon (if you have 4x4 and/or fantastic clearance), or a place like corkscrew peak. Mostly I would just recommend getting up and out by 7am to start hiking.

Also if you want to avoid the people at Zabriski Point for sunset, try going up Hole in the Wall and just pulling out off the side. Plenty of gorgeous views and it‚Äôs easy to have a private area",t2_6imu8,2JMAN89,0,1640787443.0,0,t1_hqetsmm,hqetsmm,True,Skwealer,t3_rr248i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/rr248i/how_busy_will_dv_be_this_new_years_weekend/,How busy will DV be this New Year's weekend?,/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/rr248i/how_busy_will_dv_be_this_new_years_weekend/hqetsmm/,1,r/DeathValleyNP,0,1
"Don't know if this is still useful, but Keane Wonder Mine is one of the most strenuous hikes I've ever done. It's like 1.5 miles but with 1,500 feet elevation gain.

I used to be able to do it all in 2 hours.

"**[Death Valley Germans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_Germans)** 
 
 >The Death Valley Germans (as dubbed by the media) were a family of four tourists from Germany who went missing in Death Valley National Park, on the California‚ÄìNevada border, in the United States, on 23 July 1996. Despite an intense search and rescue operation, no trace of the family was discovered and the search was called off. In 2009, the presumed remains of the adult members of the family were discovered by hikers who were searching for evidence of the fate of the tourists, and conclusive proof of the fate of the male adult was later established.

Does this mean he did not stop *and sleep* in lone pine on Saturday evening? Does anybody have access to his bank accounts to see if he refilled gas/diesel/water here? 

Continuing into the park after passing through lone pine, the most likely places to stop are saline valley road, then father Crowley overlook, then the road that leads to the parking lot for Darwin Falls. What is the likelihood he went north on Saline valley road?

Don't eat at The Ranch at Furnace Creek. The food is awful and way overpriced.

"We were in the park on December 11th and 12th. We arrived after sunset on the 10th and left before sunrise on the 14th, so those were two full days in the park. 

We felt that it was an adequate amount of time to feel like we had ""done the park."" Undoubtedly, you could spend a month there doing a more complete survey of the park's offerings; but in those two days, we did:

-	Badwater Basin
-	Devil‚Äôs Golf Course
-	Artist‚Äôs Drive/Palette 
-	Zabriskie Point
-	Darwin Falls
-	Natural Bridge
-	Golden Canyon
-	Mosaic Canyon
-	Star Wars Canyon
-	The Junior Ranger Program

With another day, we would have done Ubehebe Crater and Racetrack Playa, but the drive there and back did not fit into our time.

The big caveats here were that we stayed in the park at The Inn, and we were going from sunrise to sunset. Be aware that the days are short in December, and there is a decent amount of driving in the park.

"You could have a lot of snow going up to Telescope turning it from a hike to a mountaineering expedition.

The Cottonwood-Marble Canyon loop is one of the few formalized backcountry hikes and is a two or three day voyage.  I day hiked Marble Canyon and thought it was fantastic.  You will need high clearance but not likely 4WD to get to the end of the road in either canyon.

The hikes listed on the NPS website are all good and on there for a reason.

"I was in DVNP around Halloween. I had a similar experience as you. All the hotels within the park were quite expensive ($300+). I stayed in Beatty which is in Nevada but it only took about 35-45 minutes to get to DVNP. Just make sure to pack some food with you for the day so you don't need to drive back. Water is free and plentiful at the visitor center in the park 

I stayed at the Motel 6. I know that it gets a bad reputation but the rooms were actually quite clean and only cost around $60 per night. It's directly next door to Denny's so at least you have an affordable breakfast place right there too.

If you do stay in Beatty, check out the Rhyolite Ghost Town. You can see all of it probably an hour but it's kind of neat. Also, depending on where you are in DV and which route you take back to the motel, you can stop at Ash Meadows Wildlife Refuge.

"Canon Rebel t6i mounted with a t ring to a Skywatcher 8"" f/4 Newtonian on a EQM 35 equatorial mount. 1 minute long exposure at 800 ISO iirc. Wasn't able to align the telescope perfectly, so I was astounded when I was able to look at Andromeda through the lens and even more so when I mounted the camera. Would have stayed longer had the wind not made it so biting cold. And the anxiety of being next to a massive crater in the dark didn't help either lol. Mount is also probably under powered for the weight. I wanted to capture some night time landscape shots but I somehow managed to forget my camera tripod. 

Not too upset though, Death Valley left such an impression on me I'm already making plans to go back. Ironically the night sky left me a bit underwhelmed. I visited Amboy Crater closer to Los Angeles in the summer and felt that, aside from light domes on either side, the sky was as dark or darker there. However I don't know if it's because my eyes were playing tricks on me, or if I simply didn't want long enough for it to get truly dark. I'll admit seeing the Milky Way at 6 30 in the afternoon was a surprise.

Ostensibly Ubehebe and most of northern Death Valley are Bortle 1 sites, as dark as you can get without being in the middle of the ocean. Amboy by comparison was a Bortle 3 site. We did leave at around 9 so it's entirely possible the skies could have gotten even darker.

"Take good paper maps. Bring several.  We gave one of ours away to a lost family trying to find their way out of the park.

Do not expect cell service or data service while in the park.  You may get some spotty service, especially in Furnace Creek or Stovepipe Wells, but depending on your carrier you may be in roam mode.  Consider having cell and data service an anomaly and plan on not having any.  You may get slow wifi at your hotel or campground. Do not expect your phones gps mapping app to work reliably, even if you download map data.  During our trip both our phones downloaded maps and gps apps became unreliable for some reason.  But we did not care, we had paper maps and I had road conditions saved. Take extra chargers and battery packs for phones.

If going off road check road conditions at the DeathValley National park website, they have an extensive listing of road conditions and what type vehicle is recommended to navigate them.

Bring food and water into the park if you can. Restaurant and grocery options in the park are extremely limited and expensive.  We brought enough food for lunches and snacks and a little breakfast and paid the extortionate restaurant prices for dinners.

"Nov-Feb is the best time to camp in DV imo, so go for it!

Flash flooding in the mojave desert is really uncommon outside of monsoon season (late summer-ish) so you shouldn't have to worry about that.

This time of year a bigger weather concern are sudden snowstorms in the high elevation parts of the park. Nearly all the places people commonly camp usually remain snow free all year, but some parts of the park are only accessed via backcountry roads with intermittent high elevation passes that \*do\* commonly see snow, so sometimes even small snowstorms can have a major impact on accessibility to different parts of the park (albeit usually only for a few days, max).

It does rain in the winter out there (i think winter is actually the 'wettest' season), but the rains are a very different style than the drenching summer storms. They tend to be very light and prolonged or on/off, as opposed to the heavy and intense afternoon downpours that are common in the summer.",t2_5k662942,iamvegenaut,0,1638042691.0,0,t1_hmb6vms,hmb6vms,True,banshee1313,t3_r3kyg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/r3kyg2/death_valley_late_january_i_am_thinking_of/,"Death Valley late January?

Its not a difficult drive at all.  Paved the entire way.  You likely won't run into many other vehicles, as the north end of the park is fairly empty even during the day.

> Is the Fall Canyon trailhead typically accessible by sedan from Scottys Castle Rd

Its doable for sure, but a bit rough in places.  Take it slow, and keep in mind that it feels much longer than it is, as you're climbing.

> Would like to get a good distance out in Badwater Basin by first light before sunrise to where things are a bit more undisturbed. Would 2 miles be plenty?

2 miles is overkill.  Most people don't even go a mile out there.  Also, if you don't walk straight out, and instead head on an angle, you'll get away from the trampled area even faster.

Most of the more touristy attractions are located around Furnace Creek so it may be a better place to base yourself out of if you don't mind that its basically the major hub of DV and overrun with people. It may though make sense being that you only have 2 days. Panamint Springs is only about 45 minutes away if you want more solitude at the end of your day.

Yes. Would I recommend it? Not really. It is a beautiful spot to spend the night, though! Perhaps Wildrose campground could be an alternative?

"Hi,

Check with your carrier the coverage map for the area -don't you guess that there's not going to be serviced, actually look into it and find out. If there is any coverage whatsoever consider a cell booster (there are omnidirectional and directional).

This does not mean that a personal locator beacon is not also an outstanding idea, not just because of this trip, but because it's an outstanding idea among any other outstanding idea.

If you're going from hole-in-the-wall to mahogany I'm assuming you're going through Baker, definitely gas up there because the gas prices in furnace Creek or Shoshone will make you cry.

My best recommendation if you go to Texas springs park in one of the parking spots and walk around and see who's going to be leaving.

"Also be prepared for high winds and combined with a rare rainstorm you could get cold without proper gear. Remember the days are growing shorter so depart early as possible so you won't have to hurry back as the sunlight ends. I suggest slowing down when you hit the bristlecone pine forest and explore the area off-trail because these trees are fantastic and amazing. 

If you have time on the return after you round Bennett Peak head straight north to the summit of Rogers Peak where all the microwave towers are for a different view and then stroll down the maintenance road back to Mahogany Flats. The views of a sunset may be well worth this route and the sun could keep you warm if the air is cold. 

One other fun note. Enjoy being frightened by the loud wing flapping noise produced by the sage grouse (pine hens) who you won't see until you're upon them and then all take flight instantly and then fly to a close by location to land again. It seems like this happens to me every time I've hiked up to Telescope.

"We ran into a guy about halfway to the Racetrack who had driven out his old rust bucket Mitsubishi Lancer from Michigan.  I told him we'd look for him at the Playa and come back for him if we didn't see him, but he finally made it (after about 3.5 hours lol) and we invited him to camp near us. The following day he left 3 hours earlier than we did so we could make sure he made it back to the pavement safely, so it's doable, but I'd hate to encourage you that it will be okay or wise to attempt without some support or a plan B. 

If you upgraded your rental to even a midsized SUV you'd be fine of you tale it slow. Just make sure the spare tire is inflated properly and that the jack and lugnut wrench are present and you'll be fine to get out and back as long as the weather is fair. Take way more water than you think you need as well and maybe some powerbars or something just in case you have to stay overnight waiting for assistance.

"My 22yo son and I both feel it has a certain energy to it. I am not a ""crystals and secret energy"" guy in any way, shape, or form, but something about the Grandstand makes me feel like there is a power there (now I sound like a whacko lol). Next time you are there, tap on the rock formations of the Grandstand -they make reverberating sounds at differen pitches and tones. Now I'm sure that a petrologist/geologist could explain to me why they do this due to their mineral composition and fissures in their outer layers, but there is just something very special about that place. 

We often talk about what it would have been like to stumble across it as an indigenous person, and I would love to know what lore if any it held for them in their local ideologies.  

If nothing else, it is so unique in its terrain its just a thrill to take in.

"Thank you! No the road from Ubehebe Crater to Racetrack Playa is passable in a 2wd low-clearance vehicle, although it will be a long, 27 mile bumpy ride down a washboard road and takes an average of about 3.5 hours from what I hear from the few people I've met out there (we do it in about 45 minutes).

Those ruts are 40"" deep silt beds on the backside of Eureka Dunes heading up into the box canyon at the start of Steele Pass (shown in night time photo over my hood), which requires a modified high clearance 4x4 to pass.

"""To escape Death Valley‚Äôs famous summer heat, consider our higher elevation campgrounds for more pleasant overnight options: Mesquite Spring, Wildrose, Thorndike, Mahogany Flat.""

This is from the parks website. Thorndike and Mahogany Flat both suggest 4WD and high clearance. 

All these are first come first serve, and if you're coming in later in the day, it might be slim pickings.

Death valley is amazing, but i honestly would not suggest going in July. It won't get cooler than 100¬∞, even at night, and one flat tire or overheated car could cost you your life.  And once the sun comes up, it's 125¬∞ driving out of the park.  Obviously many people visit death valley in the summer, but i like to err on the side of caution. 

If you do decide to go ... may i suggest Dante's View for sunrise? Absolutely gorgeous.

"I listened to most of it today and also whipped out my copy of Digonnet - some of what she said sounded like it was verbatim from that book.  However, he also calls out the 70' and 40' drops as you descend Willow Canyon...so from her description, you could pretty much exactly figure out where she lay (at the 70' drop).  It's easy to say after-the-fact that it wasn't a good idea, for sure.

I wasn't there so I don't want to second guess her/their decision - but it definitely makes you think what your thought process might be when things really go sideways.  I haven't been out in the desert in 18+ months, so I've been in easymode with cell service.  But I *have* been in some places where I knew it was all up to me, and in a way I thought the challenge was sort of exhilarating.  Only once was I really in any kind of bad danger (took a bad route going up Ubehebe Peak in Death Valley without really knowing WTF I was doing), and I gotta say I didn't care for the feeling.

I've always heard if you're lost or in trouble, stay put so they (in this case, SAR) can find you.  This apparently reinforces that.

Not sure if they were aired down - it wasn't mentioned. One of the lessons here is that if you're not traveling with a caravan, a satellite communications device is required equipment for this type of area (she says in the interview that they had often talked about buying one but never did).

Condolences. I have no expertise, and hindsight is 20/20.

It's easy to say to the hypothetical to ""stay with the vehicle"". But they very well may have done just that, for say the first two days or something. The note wouldn't need to say they had more water but drank some -- it would describe the situation at the moment they left the vehicle location. If the note didn't have a date and time, that would be surprising.

Walking to re-trace their vehicle path may seem doable. But I think one could make better time even on an uphill hiking trail (that hikers like them would be used to) than a rocky dirt road, which is to say that it would be easy to over-estimate the miles one would be able to cover. ETA: the bad path you know, would still almost always be WAY superior to any unknown path.

Did the two flats happen at the same time? Likely if caused by a sharp rock that the front tire hit that the back tire hit a moment later. Otherwise after swapping the first flat for the spare, surely they'da turned around. I've never tried this but I think I'd want to drive with the spare, and one flat rear passenger side tire. Dunno if the lighter passenger would be best in the front passenger seat or the rear driver-side seat.

A topo map definitely woulda helped. There's a misconception that if you see a ridge, just ascend to its spine to see the terrain and maybe even get a cell signal. That will almost never work because the ""top of the ridge"" isn't a high point -- it just looks that way from below.",t2_teik0az,ShiftyRider,0,1620748661.0,0,t1_gxqqkd8,gxqqkd8,False,andrewforyang,t3_mmxfdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/mmxfdo/sar_underway_for_missing_persons_in_death_valley/,"SAR underway for Missing Persons in Death Valley - Be On The Lookout for Alexander Lofgren andEmily Henkel from Tucson, AZ",/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/mmxfdo/sar_underway_for_missing_persons_in_death_valley/gxqqkd8/,1,r/DeathValleyNP,0,1

"Yep. Tuttle Creek is BLM and probably cheaper than the forest service camps if that is a concern. It's on the valley floor, so hotter and more exposed. Lone Pine Camp is on Whitney portal road at the base of the mountains but way further downhill from Whitney Portal campground, which is way up there in elevation and a longer drive. Another option is dispersed camping in the Alabama Hills, which is free but no water, trash, or toilets, but could be good if you're just looking to crash for the night. I don't know how long you plan on sticking around the area or if you're planning on hiking etc., but I would recommend hiking up into the mountains out to one of the passes (although Whitney Zone requires a day use permit).

"Currently the temperature is 95 at Furnace Creek. This week there will be two highs of 106. May temps average at 100 degrees with a low of 73, that low is generally at night time, though it also depends on where you are in the park, but temps have reached highs of 122 in May as well. I've been at Badwater when it is 113 degrees at 12am and then drove up to Dantes View which overlooks Badwater and the temperature is 60 degrees.

Death Valley is massive, the biggest National Park in the states outside of Alaska. There is plenty to see and do there and the best part of summer is the warm to hot nights under the stars. Hiking can be very dangerous during the summer months and that includes in May. You need to make sure you bring plenty of water, on you and in your car, also make sure you are protected from the sun. There will be no reception in the park except for a few areas. If you break down stay with your car. Higher elevated areas have cooler temps, you should look on their website to see what they advise. Depending on the temp during the days you may go you might be able to hike in the mountains where the temp may be alot cooler. For the most part you should be planning your hikes very early in the morning.

 You can still see plenty by driving around. If the weather is too intense for hiking, you can always pull over and get out of your car and wonder around a scenic area briefly. Make sure you know the symptoms of heat stroke though. If its too hot, find a cool place you'd like to return too during sunset and just kick it there throughout the night so you can see some of the best nightsky views in America.",t2_fxgnu3e,tallestmanonline,0,1619222371.0,0,t1_gvmlj8q,gvmlj8q,True,wilshirelabrea,t3_mx7xaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/mx7xaj/for_first_time_visitors_is_midmay_too_hot_for/,"For first time visitors, is mid-May too hot for daytime hiking?",/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/mx7xaj/for_first_time_visitors_is_midmay_too_hot_for/gvmlj8q/,15,r/DeathValleyNP,0,15

Sonora pass is technically the fastest northern route, but might not be worth it if youre not up for the grueling drive. Tioga pass is the most direct from the Bay Area but not the fastest bc of speed limits in Yosemite.

There isn‚Äôt a ton of room on top. I‚Äôve seen tiny campers & tent trailers, but even that‚Äôs a tight fit. It‚Äôs a relatively flat hike, with a little elevation gain toward Telescope Pk. We would hike it as a training hike for Whitney and/or Grand Cyn - it‚Äôs similar in distance, so good for conditioning the feet for long walks/hikes. When you first start there is a little exposure as you traverse the side of the hill on the east. Then it bears west a bit, and much of the rest is on the broad top. You can go up the road, around the antennas, and down the other side to meet up with the trail, but it‚Äôs very rocky on the south side of the antennas, and may be more of an injury/tripping hazard.
