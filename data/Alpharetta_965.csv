I applied for a variance one time and everything was all good and they told me they’d recommend accepting it at the hearing. The night before the hearing I got a cell phone call from the guy whom I had been working with telling me he no longer worked there and that his boss Kathy had come into his office telling him to rewrite the proposal as rejected before the hearing. They were going to blindside me at the hearing and catch me unprepared to make arguments bc I thought it was going to be approved. He wouldn’t tell me why she told him to do this but it seemed shady as hell and I’ve never found out who in our little city pulled that string.,t2_5wde14wc,PracticalDogHair,0,1648231751.0,0,t1_i23ffva,i23ffva,False,boglehead1,t3_tnnsg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/alpharetta/comments/tnnsg2/getting_a_zoning_variance_for_a_patio/,Getting a zoning variance for a patio?,/r/alpharetta/comments/tnnsg2/getting_a_zoning_variance_for_a_patio/i23ffva/,3,r/alpharetta,0,3

We used to tell people that ‘Roswell/Alpharetta is like Fairfield county but with wider roads and nicer people’. It’s wild to me how much this area has further progressed _since then_. 

We do still experience things like our children’s Christian classmates proselytizing to them in public school, but aside from that, we appreciate the diversity of our friends and neighbors immensely. We just moved to a new neighborhood and a neighbor commented how happy they are to welcome folks of open and diverse thinking because ‘it hasn’t always been this way’. I think you’ll be ok!

"Like other posters have stated, there won’t be as much culture shock as you might fear because Alpharetta is an extremely transplant-heavy suburban community, where most of the residents are from other states (including the Northeast, the Midwest, California, and other parts of the South) and other countries (including Latin America and Asia).

Though, there will still be a noticeable difference in the politics of a state like Georgia... A state in Georgia which, even with the Democrats winning the state in the 2020 Presidential Election and the two 2021 U.S. Senate runoff elections, still has a state government controlled and dominated by deeply conservative Republicans at least for the time being.

 The local politics in an affluent and increasingly diverse suburban community like Alpharetta will be more moderate and center-right, while the politics at the state level may often range from center-right, to decidedly right-of-center, to far-right/hard-right... That’s particularly during statewide election years like the current one where many members of the state’s Republican majority will be racing to see who can get the farthest to the right the fastest.

Beyond that, the Alpharetta, Johns Creek and South Forsyth County areas are home to an explosively fast-growing Asian population (largely South Asian and Korean) that seems to be slated to turn Forsyth County (where the population was virtually 100% white as recently as the 1980’s) to a ‘majority-minority’ county where racial and ethnic minorities will make up a majority of the population within the next 10-15 years or so.

 Because of Alpharetta’s status as a fast-growing major tech hub for much of the Southeastern U.S., the diversity of the area is growing at an astonishing rate and appears to be accelerating.

 The schools in North Fulton and Forsyth counties (particularly in the Northview, Chattahoochee, Alpharetta, Johns Creek, Milton, Cambridge, Lambert, South Forsyth, Denmark and Roswell school clusters) also are extremely-to-exceptionally highly-rated and often serve as a top recruiting ground for the biggest and best colleges and universities in the Southeastern U.S.   

If a child performs well academically in the public schools here, they will attract the attention of some notable post-secondary institutions in the Southern and Eastern U.S... Though, be warned that the academic competition to earn admission and scholarships to universities can be tough in the schools in this area.

But more than any culture shock that you might potentially experience might be some ‘weather shock’ in adjusting to a significantly wetter climate that features much more moisture and humidity in the summer, significantly colder temperatures in the winter, and significantly more rain throughout the year in most years.

Much of Southern California may receive anywhere between 2 and 20 inches of precipitation on average each year.   But Atlanta receives about 50 inches of precipitation on average each year, with yearly precipitation totals of 60-80 inches not being uncommon in some years.   Also be prepared for winter season temperatures that can drop as low as into the 20s and teens on some days between November and March.

You might also notice a much more sports-oriented culture (especially at the high school and college levels) after moving to Georgia.   Sports (especially college football, and especially SEC/Southeastern Conference college football, along with some ACC/Atlantic Coast Conference college football, etc.) are really big here.

Life doesn’t revolve wholly and completely around high school football in the Atlanta suburbs like it does in small cities and towns throughout the rural South.  But high school football Friday nights are still a really big thing in the Atlanta suburbs along with college football Saturdays.   Other sports like basketball, soccer, baseball and lacrosse also may get a noticeable amount of attention.

If you want to make quickly make friends across a broad cross-section of the community, including at some of the highest levels of the community, become active in your local high school’s football booster club.

 Becoming active in the local chapter of your favorite college/university and its football team may also be a good way to help one quickly make friends during normal times, along with living in an active swim-tennis community where much of the neighborhood’s social activity will revolve around the community swimming pool during warm weather months, with other organized neighborhood activities during cooler weather months.",t2_ftpfj0yw,Born-2-Roll,0,1647667961.0,0,t1_i190goz,i190goz,True,babs6425,t3_th3n8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/alpharetta/comments/th3n8n/best_advice_for_a_california_family_moving_to_the/,Best advice for a California family moving to the Alpharetta area?,/r/alpharetta/comments/th3n8n/best_advice_for_a_california_family_moving_to_the/i190goz/,6,r/alpharetta,0,6

"> As for decriminalization, what you're describing just turns prisons into extremely expensive (and staggeringly ineffective) homeless shelters, detox clinics and mental health wards. That's the core point being made by the super-scary ""defund the police"" proposal: instead of spending X building another prison or buying the SF Po another humvee to pick up and incarcerate public poopers, spend that same money on mental health facilities, public bathrooms and subsidized housing, and see which one is more effective in the long run.

Have you been to San Francisco? There are public bathrooms within feet of these piles of poop. Mental health facilities might help, but not if they are run poorly. It seems like the problem is that people have rampant, untreated drug addictions and that's driving all this.

I certainly don't want jails full of poopers, but if it comes down to an option of ""we'll try things for 10 years while the poop spreads"" and ""poopers in jail."" I favor the latter.

We'll certainly see what's more effective in the long run and it's been decades of seeing CA get worse and worse. Again, this isn't just foisted on CA as FL doesn't have the same problems.

One example of something I think is bad is how public indecency is decriminalized as well as petty theft. In Georgia, if you poop on the sidewalk, you get arrested.

- establishing a city composting program,
- starting more community gardens,

- bringing more produce vendors into our farmers markets,
- advocating that city landscaping include native and/or edible plants,

"Closest I've ever found is LaBella's in Marietta on Sandy Plains Road.  Vintage Pizzeria in Crabapple has a good slice too - their sauce is pretty dead on, but it's not quite that NYC slice that LaBella has.  Vintage is from NJ, so maybe closer to what you're looking for.  

Mellow Mushroom is our week night go to.  Peace Love & Pizza is similar.  If I were ranking area pizzas, Dominos and Papa Johns being a 1 and NYC pizza being a 10, I'd put those two firmly at 7s.  Vintage is probably a 7-8, and LaBella is a 9.  Campania is brick oven pizza - excellent within its own right, but artisanal and not what you're looking for.  Closer to Italian pizza than NY pizza.

"As someone else mentioned, Glassdoor is a good place to start, but here's an anecdote.

One of my kids graduated with a CS degree in 2017 and has been working in ATL or Sandy Springs as a software engineer since then. (Remote since covid started.)

Right after graduation he started at a Fortune 50 company with a high 5-figure salary. By late 2019 he had moved to a smaller company and was making in the low 100's.

He's now 5 years out of college and recently accepted a job at a startup in Sandy Springs for $150k plus equity.

All positions have been W-2 with competitive benefits.

I've been in IT for almost 30 years now. I think it's reasonable to expect that with current demand you should be pretty easily able to find a job in the $80k+ range and expect to increase that by at least 50% after 2-3 years if you work hard to learn and show your worth.

"Just wanted to say that we just wrapped up a week of touring the various northern suburbs and LOVED Alpharetta (Avalon / downtown) and also the parts of Milton that were close to downtown Milton and weren’t too remote.

Cumming felt a bit “simple” - VERY kid-oriented, not much to do aside from Vickery / Halcyon, super far from Atlanta proper and even a bit removed from Avalon. 

We felt that while the Cumming subdivisions zoned into South Forsyth High were quite diverse (we saw lots of desi families looking at the same homes), the areas around Vickery and zoned into West Forsyth were very “Pleasantville” (lots of SAHMs, all socializing revolves around kid activities). 

My realtor goes “i can’t say more, but these are the types of people who vacation at all inclusive resorts.”  

I’m like “well, the Amanpulo is quite lovely and I’m drooling over the architecture of the Fogo Island Inn and both are all inclusive technically” and he’s like “umm try Atlantis Bahamas.” At that point, we knew Cumming was NOT for us!  And it wasn’t even an issue of socioeconomics, just personal preference and who you are as people.

"Yeah, ""As Is"" stipulates that the buyer is committed to not asking for any repairs after inspections during Due Diligence. But, if the buyer is still in Due Diligence, then yeah they can walk away for any reason and get their Earnest Money back. 

If a buyer waives DD and finds some major issues, then they would need to decide to either terminate the deal and lose their earnest money, or move forward anyway. It's definitely a gamble, but it can pay off. I've also had buyers waive Appraisal Contingency with the same idea that they might just walk away and lose their earnest money if it appraises too low. Of course, in those cases, I'd try to keep their earnest money as low as possible too.

One reason we left for Alpharetta is that it has more character, with an awesome downtown area. And lots of sidewalks.

We want to do a new kitchen and have a HELOC through a local credit union, but now I'm wondering if my value has gone up enough why not just refinance the first mortgage again so I don't have to deal with the variable rate of the HELOC (and maybe even get more cash than the HELOC credit line)

Am I stupid for potentially eating yet another set of closing costs? Any good mortgage companies I should talk to about a cash-out refinance? (My current mortgage guy didn't do cash outs, and I didn't want to do it at that time but now the rocket ship has gone up a lot more)

Fortunately, if you were on the other side, it was still an amazing time to sell your home. I ran into situations with 81 offers on a home and another with 155 offers on a home. Absolutely nuts.

As you can see, available inventory is at an all-time low. In fact, the inventory at the start of the year was the lowest level recorded since 1999. Prices are still shooting up, although it feels recently like it's starting to plateau just a bit on that front. Will be interesting to see how February shakes out.

The market needs houses to sell, and it needs a lot of them. Hopefully we'll start to find a little shift in the balance at some point. Here's to a strong 2022, and maybe we'll back of the ""unprecedented"" aspects...

"Forsyth County's reputation is still trying to recover from a vocal, violent history of racism and bigotry against African Americans.  The area is much more diverse than when I moved here 20 years ago.  In fact, I saw a statement by a FOCO school administrator a few months ago that said our school system will be minority white next school year.  My oldest daughter graduated a few years ago from South Forsyth and she was one of the few in her friend group who was white.  They were mostly Pakistani, Indian, Chinese American and Korean American.  We have a very, very large population of South Asians with their holidays regularly being celebrated (you know, fireworks complaints on NextDoor).  

I'm not really sure what your realtor means by ""Stepford"" as compared to Alpharetta.  Having lived in both and having friends in both, I'd say Forsyth is much less cliquey, competitive and more welcoming than Alpharetta/Roswell.  But, now that I think of it, I do know 2 families who were ""blue collar"" workers that moved because they thought it was too ""hoity toity"".  I didn't (don't see it myself) and chalked it up to blaming their terrible personality for other's lack of welcome.  But maybe there's more to it that I just don't see.

From what you've described of you and your husband, you sound like you'd fit right in. We have one neighbor who is English, one neighbor who is Irish, another neighbor who has lived in Shanhai (adopted their daughter there) and Scotland. My daughter's coach's wife when she was younger regularly had purple or pink hair (way before that became a ""thing"" after the pandemic started).  We're in a neighborhood very close to Windermere.  I will say that the further north you go in the county the more rural it becomes with less diversity.  But, that's changing as well as the Atlanta sprawl just keeps moving north up 400.  I heard someone say the other day ""Dawsonville is the new Cumming"".  Meaning the town north of us on 400 is now looking similar to what Cumming did for years because there's been so much growth.  My biggest complaint about Forsyth County is the clear cutting and the lack of infrastructure to support the approved growth.  Traffic is terrible.  But, my guess, that's prob said about most places people live.

We have some friends who live in Windermere, they don't golf, she's a teacher, just very normal down-to-earth people and they love the amenities.  

Wherever you decide on, try to stay out of Fulton County if you can for tax reasons, imo.  (Some areas of Alpharetta are in Forysyth and Cherokee county as well as Fulton.)

Don't get me wrong.  Forsyth is a predominantly Republican county in the South with rural and suburban vibes and all that brings with it.

Much luck to you in finding your next home in this crazy market!  Things are going on the market and under contract the next day.

"South Forsyth culturally is an interesting mix. In the time I moved here (also from South Florida) South Forsyth moved from its more rural southern roots to more of an upscale suburban community for fairly high income families. It’s not uncommon to see a family SUV, a Ferrari, and a lifted 4x4 pickup truck with Trump flags/stickers at any given traffic light. 

I think the Stepford thing comes in part from the mix of high income families here with tendencies to form social cliques that are dominated/dictated by the matriarchs of the households.

"We’re looking at Cumming (S Forsyth, mainly) and moving in from out of state (Miami).  

We love the inventory in S Forsyth but can you tell us a bit about the, umm, demographics?  Our realtor told us it could be a bit “Stepford” but hesitates to tell us more because of legal stuff (which I get, as I’m a recovering lawyer). 

My husband and I both have careers (his is fintech, mine is legal / professional services), have lived in cities as diverse as Hong Kong, Brooklyn, and CDMX (currently living in Wynwood, Miami) and I am half Asian.  The major December holiday that we celebrate is Art Basel. I’m a distance runner and am drooling over Big Creek Greenway access. 

I also love those “I Love Cumming” shirts and have basically earmarked a ton of them as birthday gifts lol.

"Hate to say it, but based on my observations at the Lake Club over the 5 or so years I’ve lived here, Windward community people are generally:

A) old, retired, and overbearing “get off my lawn” types

B) cliquey groups of young families who have no interest in being social with anyone outside of the clique

C) introverted families that are anti-social and keep to themselves 

This may vary by the neighborhood you buy a house in. None of my neighbors talk to anyone in my sub-neighborhood. Outside of the nice retired lady who lives by herself next door that we occasionally help out, I can count the times I’ve talked to our neighbors on one hand. I couldn’t even tell you their names. You would be hard pressed to think anyone lives here.

"I’ve seen a few posts on other sites saying the mayor of Alpharetta, Jim Gilvin, walked by this guy and immediately went into city hall and told a police officer to arrest Jeff as he was pan handling. There were comments on the City of Alpharetta FB page concerning this accusation that were taken down. Does anyone have any update ? 

Call me crazy, but if indeed the Mayor is making false accusations leading to someone’s arrest, that’s probably not a great thing for Alpharetta and is also not super legal. I mean I’m no lawyer, but I watched Matlock with my memaw. 

Anyone in town in the last year probably saw the very large stop the steal and pro trump rallies that took place literally on the steps of, and directly in front of city hall. I heard of no one arrested or hassled and they were a fairly large loud group.  To my knowledge no one at these events was asked to move along, and there was no interaction with the protesters and police.

For context the BLM rallies that took place along Highway 9 last year were very chill, and the APD was very respectful and interacted in a friendly manner with the participant at those events. I believe they even distributed water to the mostly high school and college age participants. So if Gilvin did make false claims, it’s just really foolish and peculiar thing to do imo, as there are cameras all over that area. So even if this guy wasn’t filming, he would be able to prove he wasn’t asking for money.

"For a bit of back story  on me.

We moved to Alpharetta in the late 80s, I remember the when the library was behind AlphaSoda near Eagle Gymnasium/Old city hall - neither of which exist today. I remember biking to Philips Variety and buying my first baseball glove, I remember when they put the pool in at Wills Park - so like I've seen Alpharetta grow and flourish which makes me really happy.

Now that I have a family of my own, and the road our house was on was not the greatest for small kids (right on Providence Rd - not great for a toddler that likes to run) we bought a house in neighbor in Roswell and have been there for a year.

The city occasionally runs a street sweeper in the neighborhood - never seen that in Alpharetta, even at my parents who are in a neighborhood. 

The Roswell Park systems feels more geared to younger families, as opposed to just team sports. 

This has changed a bit, but the Roswell Libraries always seemed better staffed and had more stuff then the Alpharetta Libraries  (I haven't been in the City Center Library all that much - but it is gorgeous).

Of course, the recycling center/transfer station, and I don't know why we can't share. It seems as a political entity, the other cities in the area try to avoid doing business with Alpharetta.

I have seen several times over the years City of Roswell does a rain barrel clinic.

"Well...there are a TON of options and most of them are, to us, 8 or more out of 10. Totally worth your time. Everything here I would go again and again.

So...IMHO/YMMV...would like others to weigh in!

This list is by no means complete...we've yet to find a place we'd say...yeah no. 

So the bar at Citizen Soul is very mellow. Bartenders are super nice. 

Next door you have Holmes...which has a bar you can chill at but it's tiny. Their drinks are typically very creative and I love their food. Everyone was nice. They tend to be ridiculously busy. I recommend sitting inside for food but outside is comfortable. 

Lapeer has some great bartenders as well. Very nice. High class. Very chill. Quiet.

Mercantile Social has youthful scene sometimes with loud music.   

Smokejack is great if you just want the traditional local place vibe. Great service, great food. Community star. 

Truck and Tap is great for a fun vibe as well.  

The bartender at Made that we met is really chatty and really nice. Great drinks, small bar.

Coalition has some great drinks. Bartenders are nice and friendly. I got kind of the...you want to go in and be a regular...vibe from them. 

Pure has a nice scene. It's got a very warm feel and great food on top of all that. Margaritaville without Margaritaville if that makes sense....

Salt has a nice bar scene. I think if I was just starting in the area I might start with Salt. Great service, nice people, normal drink fare. Just comfortable and familiar. Everyone seemed like regulars without seeming overly chummy. Not sure that makes sense. Personally, the one thing I ding Salt on is that their food isn't salty. It's weird. Maybe you'll like it more than we did. We still go for drinks though. It's nice bar scene. 

Firebirds down the way and across from Avalon...if you can get there for happy hour you won't be disappointed as parking is easy and their prices are right. Everyone was nice. I have to say that we've probably spent the most time there because it's easy for people to find, get in and out of, and to not drop half your paycheck. Nothing to write home about. 

Avalon: Branch and Barrel, Marlowe's, Barley Garden. We enjoyed those. A buddy of mine said that Marlowe's might be a meat market. I don't have personal experience so I can't say. Branch is great for people watching and Barley is just kind of a cool friendly vibe. 

The issue with Avalon is parking so...if you get a slot...enjoy the evening. 

All are in or near downtown Alpharetta and I'd be thrilled to have a drink at any of them.

Those are just the ones I've been to...there's probably another 8 to 10 more. There are several others that I hear are great among those. 

My recommendation is to check them out and see what vibe fits you best.

"hi, former student of KR here. I was lucky enough to be friends with the few progressive kids there. I was in KR from 3rd to 8th grade, and im now a sophomore at a different private school just down the road from them. from my time there, i felt that the student population was pretty conservative, but the school never really pushed a lot. I will say, I was different from the other kids there. I am a queer atheist, and was very open about not believing at the school. My parents are not religious, and I was initially sent there because the original headmaster had a education over religion mindset. around 6th grade, a new headmaster came in and had the exact opposite mindset. i believe he’s still there. My christian education teachers were very respectful to me about me not believing, and one was always willing to have a conversation with me about it. The students were iffy on my beliefs. I was never harassed, but I would catch someone giving me a weird look when i talked about it. To my knowledge, the school has never made a statement regarding LGBTQ+ stuff, but according to my friends who are still there, the high school christian ed classes are still using words like “traditional marriage” and stuff like that. the school does not have a sex ed class, and when the school asked students to make a powerpoint on things the school should teach or teach better, sex ed was pretty much ignored. my friend did a whole powerpoint on sex ed, but at the end of the day, she was told that “abstinence is the only prevention”.",t2_2nfsuste,DarkRecon0620,0,1643840895.0,0,t1_hvc78l6,hvc78l6,True,MunchkinsOG,t3_siadtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/alpharetta/comments/siadtz/how_how_conservative_is_kings_ridge_school_are/,How how conservative is King’s Ridge school?

"As Mr. Drinkard already pointed out, Avalon and DT Alpharetta will be a reality - hopefully sooner vs later. DT Roswell \*is\* accessible, albeit not as easily. The Beltline (and Silver Comet Trail, by further extension), IMHO, will happen one day. Path 400 ([https://path400greenway.org/](https://path400greenway.org/)) will be a critical component in this regard. Sandy Springs seems to be getting more on board with bike/ped-friendly initiatives, and coupled with Roswell's/Alpharetta's continued vested interest in same, I believe we'll see these imagined linkages become reality. Of course, the river is a big (and costly) factor, but where there's a will, there's always a way. And though not directly in the line, Milton is also aware of the value bike-ped projects will play in making it a continually viable place to live/work/visit/play. I believe we'll see projects that help better and more safely connect Milton to Roswell and to Alpharetta (and beyond).

">terrified of cops

...well, yeah.  duh.  they carry guns which also have comically high injury rates compared to other self defense alternatives and they're kind of dicks in general from my experience.  I would absolutely advise my loved ones to minimize contact with them.  was this supposed to be some sort of gotcha?

as for the dogs, i get that you're passionate about helping animals.  and despite what you think, i like animals too.  i don't want to see them suffer.  unfortunately, the pitbull was not bred for thousands of years to herd sheep and i think if we came to the field of animal welfare with a little more pragmatism in the matter humane societies and shelters and atlanta subreddits wouldn't be absolutely FLOODED with ""sweet"" dogs that coincidentally cause the most deaths and severe injuries.

all dogs that don't attack someone are loved and trusted members of their human families that would never hurt anything.  But the small % of pibbles that do have an oopsie daisy do it in spectacular fashion that a golden-doodle or Pomeranian just isn't physically capable of matching.  and it's not like there aren't stories about labs and retrievers doing heroic things.  even cats help out once in a while, so maybe this is probably a less useful metric of breed 'goodness' than you give it credit for.

It seems like if you wanted to find one there might be a parallel that could be drawn between pit bull attacks and gun crime.  not a great one, but i think we would both agree most pitbulls are good, although if you've got one in the house the chances of being maimed are higher (at least, insurance companies think so) than if you had another breed.  similarly, most guns are used in legal nonoffensive ways, but if you've got one in the house, the chances of being maimed are higher than if you had a tazer or baton.  Both help your chances in a home invasion.  The pibble is probably a better preventative measure here because of the obvious threat of aggression (which i assume you disagree with?)

anyway, i just think maybe there should be some restrictions on who can own these breeds.  it would cut down on their abuse and their % usage of our limited and valuable animal care resources.  Statistically it would save some kiddo & other pet lives, but there are so many other good reasons to cull their numbers (through limiting demand) that I think the point is moot before we get there.

"Thank you everyone for your help and advice.  Most of the comments have been very insightful.  As for the negativity, I am going to say that I would never put taxes and low cost of living before the well being of my child.  That’s why I’m on Reditt asking for what city would be the best for her.  I wouldn’t move anywhere she wasn’t comfortable with.  There are plenty of cities in red states that are gay havens, with Atlanta being a major one.  These cities do not enforce their states prejudiced policies against certain groups.  So asking if this city would be good for my daughter and us is not an ironic question.  

I also don’t understand why some people think we Northerners are moving south to change the local politics to what we have up here.  I’m not planning on moving to a new city in order to vote for higher taxes, crime and corruption.  That’s what we’re trying to avoid, lol!  We’d be moving in order to take part in the comforts of a new city, not to change it to the misery we left. 

As for the policies I’d vote for if I were to move to Atlanta, then I’m definitely going to vote the same way I do here: for respect, rights, and inclusiveness for people from all backgrounds, genders, and orientations.  If you see that as a “northern” policy that you’re not comfortable with, then the problem is with you.  Voting for the same rights for every and any individual is not a northern, blue state or democratic policy.

"Got two trans stepchildren in North Fulton. We’ve had many problems with the schools regarding disability accommodations and lunatic teachers - but not a single problem with the kids being trans. 

I remember the eldest turning up to his new middle school, and a kid came up and asked him if he was trans, he said ‘yes’ and was invited to join their ‘gay / straight alliance’ which he did. 

That was a few years ago now. They are still all the best of friends.

Youngsters don’t even seem to think it’s an issue so I wouldn’t worry.

Neither of our two, both trans boys, have been forced to use a female restroom that I know of - if they ever were I’m pretty sure it would soon be the cis-women complaining about why these two big dudes are in their restroom.

Seriously, they look like lumberjacks. 

I’ve known adults, behind their backs, to deadname and dead-gender them, but I just correct the person and move on. I don’t recall anyone under 40 doing it though.

"Check out Suwanee. The trans, nonbinary, and LGBTQ kids in our neighborhood and in my kids’ schools blend and mesh pretty well.  There is diversity here generally but not as much as the almost-northern state we moved from. Still room for improvement there, but it‘s not a bastion of straight, rich, whiteness.  

Georgia is backwards af in certain regards but the more progressive Atlanta area (and the entirety of Georgia to a lesser degree) is ripe for change IMHO.  My family moved here in mid 2020, and since then, we flipped the state blue, our sec state went toe to toe with Trump over election results, the Braves won the World Series, and Georgia beat Alabama for the National Championship for the first time since 1980. I’m fairly certain that all of those things occurred specifically because we moved here. We just make a difference wherever we go /s. I could honestly give a shit about sports, but those are pretty big deals LOL. It’s an exciting time to be in the Atlanta area (if you can stand looking at suburbia as far as the eye can see) and I think Georgia is going to be the battleground for many of the country’s social and political issues over the next two decades. I lived here 25 years ago and there was a thriving gay community and I expect it’s much the same now or better.  Every small town GA gay got the hell outta dodge ASAP and came here- omg the clubs I used to go to back in the day, *so* much fun.

Moving to California (as an example) would be easy… moving to a place where you have the potential to change things… that is *interesting*.  

But omg, my high schooler’s “sex Ed” i.e. abstinence based curriculum… I swear it hasn’t been updated since 1950.  It’s so sleepy that you couldn’t wake that shit up with a sledgehammer.  But the fact that it was so bad made it completely ignorable- so the fact that it promotes only a heteronormative agenda would likely not bother a child that did not fit that definition- because the rest of the information is so ridiculously antiquated, as well.",t2_ff88iq8x,Whathewhat-oo-,0,1643051983.0,0,t1_hu22367,hu22367,True,sheemsters,t3_sbphk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/alpharetta/comments/sbphk1/trans_child_and_schools/,Trans child and schools,/r/alpharetta/comments/sbphk1/trans_child_and_schools/hu22367/,10,r/alpharetta,0,10

Yes, they will. I'm shocked that you would consider Georgia and Texas at all if this is your situation.

"Hi! I actually live in Chicago right now, but I grew up in Alpharetta/Johns Creek area. I think North Fulton County schools tend to be on the more liberal/blue side -- pretty sure the entire county was blue this past election.   
From my personal experience, I think that most of these high schools were pretty accepting during my time there (ie: Chattahoochee, Alpharetta, Johns Creek, etc.). As for middle schools, I'm not entirely sure. I don't recall any specific programs/schools that would support the LGBTQ+ community with their transitions, but I remember the students at my high school were pretty accepting.

However, I would say that not all the adults are as accepting so be wary of this.

"I recommend using BLACK MICRO GUARD that comes in six ft pieces. This product leaves no gaps, works as well as even the expensive guards like leafguard, looks just as sleek and is easy to install and cut accordingly as needed. You can by boxes of 200 pieces for even cheaper than that bulky, ugly and overpriced guard available at homedepot. Anyone installing that crap is disrespecting the gutter game and needs a training course in gutters. They should stop ripping people the fuck off. 

There are many kinds of effective guard but they are usually expensive, both in the cost of materials for you, and the price quoted to consumers which often turns them away despite really wanting and needed guard. 

There is alot of people in the gutter work business who install gutter improperly. They don't know the correct kinds of screws and sealant needed, don't set the drain correctly, don't unclog the downspouts. They do sloppy work, and make costly mistakes such as hanging the new gutter over the existing drip edge guard or not installing  drip guard at all, and over time water leaks into the house and rots the fascia board. Gutters often are not tightly fastened to ensure it stays up long term. Sealant used will typically wear out after about 5 to 10 years and needs to be reapplied.

At any rate, here's a link to the Greenway website and it has a map of the entire path and all the entry points. 

The one we usually use is on Haynes Bridge just east of North Point Parkway (on the left if you're going east on HB). There's a nice gravel parking lot and then a short concrete path to get to the Greenway.

"We issued the following communication this morning on this topic.  Unfortunately, I failed to post it here, so I will do that now.

Consistent with previous communications this week, Republic Services is operating on a 1-day delay throughout this week due to service having been suspended on Monday because of the winter weather emergency issued by the State of Georgia.  This means that residences normally serviced on Tuesday are being serviced today, those normally serviced on Wednesdays will be serviced Thursday, etc.  
  
We are, however, aware that there have been instances this week in which Republic has serviced a few neighborhoods on their normal service day instead of following the 1-day delay schedule.  This was done in error and should not have occurred.  
  
Please be assured that if this occurred in your neighborhood, Republic Services will return to the neighborhood the following day per the 1-day delay schedule they are supposed to be operating on this week.

"Another Broken Egg at the corner of Mansell and Houze. The one on Crabapple road has always been great, but the one at Mansell and Houze has a bar, so my partner and I went there a couple of times to get bloody marys or mimosas with breakfast. Not worth it.

I sent an egg dish back 3 times once because I couldn't get an over medium egg that didn't have raw slimy whites. When I grumped about it to my partner, someone at the table next to us overheard me and said she'd given up on hers and just eaten her sides.

We went there another time and they brought us the wrong food twice.

"Wendy's? For sure. Their fries have been horror shows since they changed to the sea salt ones. (this is a hotly debated topic) 

McDonalds...eh...I know it's not great food but if you can get a good one they're fine. I have an appreciation of the 1/4 Pounder (fresh not frozen). Also the apple pies are good enough. The fries are good when fresh and salty. The McGriddle will surprise you. It's better than it deserves to be.

The Big Mac has a unique flavor that I enjoy.  McRib is good. Filet O' Fish is good. 

Not saying it's haute cuisine. Yes, you can easily get better (and in Alpharetta you have a LOT of options). But, it has a place and I do get the occasional craving. 

That said....

The McDonalds that delivers to us is abysmal...they once substituted 3 large fries with one small bag of sliced apple and the bag smelled like pot. 

The one that's also close gets about 4 cars through the drive thru in the same time that Chick-fil-A can get 40 through (this was a couple months ago.)  However, their quality ""seems"" to be better.

"I fell in love with Taco Mac back in the late 1990s when I moved here. The location in Kennesaw on Busbee Parkway was a popular spot for my friends and I. I even worked at the Crabapple location for a while. 

My most recent visit there was last year some time when I ordered some food to go. As mentioned above, they got rid of most of the items I really liked - namely the Kenmore and Hollywood and replaced every burger with “two 4oz patties,” etc. 

Anyhow, when I went to pick up my order, I expressed my disappointment with the menu changes to a manger who happened to come by (I didn’t ask for him), he asked me what I ordered and told me, “it’s pretty much the same burger, just two patties instead of one. I think you’ll like it.”

He seemed knowledgeable and friendly. And he was right, I did like it. But I don’t remember the last time I ate inside that location. And it’s a shame if things are bad all over. Taco Mac was our family go-to place because everyone could find something they liked.
