"As someone that did a year on carts, these were my top peeves:

People who leave carts in spots, lazy but eh I got paid to walk, more dickish to people who want a spot and I hadn't come around yet.


Contrary to popular opinion, your local big box store parking lot isn't also the municipal dump. Nothing like seeing a lone cart way back in the lot stuffed full of trash, broken appliances, literal shit. Most common is half-eaten lunches, half-finished coffee, people who buy child car seats, remove it, put their old car seat in the new box and just leave it.


People who pull out a cart, don't like that it isn't 100% smooth AND THEN LEAVE IT RIGHT THERE, USUALLY FUCKIN SIDEWAYS AND MESSING UP THE WHOLE CORRAL. Really fun when you're pushing a whole line in and have to walk all the way to the front, re-align a sideways cart, then walk all the way back.


People who, when seeing two lanes of a cart return with a plastic bumper clearly blocking one lane off, choose to shove their carts against said bumper, causing successive people to do the same and causing a fan of carts to spill out into the lot. Just...why?

"> You cannot support this change and support livable wage. The two work against each other.

I don't think they're inherently opposed. I can be for increasing wages and for removing unnecessary roles. I personally believe the mentality that *everyone* needs to have a job or starve to be really toxic and doesn't support workers rights. 

I also get frustrated with the sentiment of jobs like fast food, or retail are jobs for teenagers or even college kids starting out. The average cashier is a woman (67% of cashiers) aged 33 and makes a wage of ~$26,000 or less. It's frustrating because people seem to be working backwards looking at the wage, seeing someone can't live off of that, and then go, oh well that job can be for kids to earn spending money. Instead of looking at who works that job and saying, why aren't they being paid enough to live?

These jobs have never been ""for high schoolers"" they're incredibly necessary roles and as we've seen during the pandemic the world falls apart without grocery clerks, stockers, and drivers. 

Yet they still aren't given a wage worth working for, and the response is usually well they should be getting a better job or it's for kids not for actual adults, yet when there are shortages of labor people blame not wages, but unemployment insurance which was never the problem.

My point is that while it's nice to have your gas pumped for you, it's a job that doesn't need to exist and it doesn't pay enough to the people that do it, and have their physical health affected while they do it that I feel like it's justified to keep such a role when the rest of this country seems to do ok.

Right now there's a labor shortage and we're finally starting to see wages creep up to if nothing else, survivable levels due to a need to fill these unskilled but completely necessary roles.

Also in theory at least, if they do cut half the jobs then there are less wages and the remainders could get raises since half the number of people are being paid. Ultimately, were you to say better wages or allow people to pump their own gas, I'd choose better wages for the workers.",t2_4isqu,Iintendtooffend,0,1648263209.0,0,t1_i25e670,i25e670,False,PatchNewsroom,t3_tnx84x,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/tnx84x/most_nj_drivers_against_pumping_their_own_gas/,Most NJ Drivers Against Pumping Their Own Gas: Patch Survey,/r/newjersey/comments/tnx84x/most_nj_drivers_against_pumping_their_own_gas/i25e670/,1,r/newjersey,0,1
">If you want to take it to ""well, they'll just fire them to save money."" Why are you arguing to keep a job that requires no unique set of skills and only exists because a law says they need to exist? Even fast food workers learn how to work the equipment to provide you with food, that I'm sure you wouldn't rather do yourself.

Four islands, 8 attendants.  That is plenty. 1 attendant for every 2 cars.

"So maybe we should allow people to pump gas for the hours that high schoolers are at, you know, high school.

The problem with saying it's good for high schoolers is just another way of saying this job doesn't pay enough for adults, but it's a legal requirement so that means every gas station needs to underpay someone who actually is working to house, feed, and care for themselves.

I don't care about the convenience, I care about how people aren't compensated enough to live and it gets hand waved away like grown ass adults aren't filling every job that's ""great for high schoolers"". And at the end of the day can't afford to make ends meet.

"I'm a small business owner (it's just me) who occasionally delivers large quantities of computer equipment to my clients.  Now... Most of the time, I can fit it into my car.  Sometimes, I can't.  So, when I need to, I rent a home depot sprinter van.  99% of my clients are within 15 minutes of my home office, so by the time I rent the van, get home, load everything up, drop it off at my client's offices, and then get the van back to HD, I'm under the first 75 minutes, which they charge $20 for.

One time I had an extra 30 minutes added to the bill because I had to wait 15 minutes for a gas station attendant to finish his cigarette, while talking on the phone.  All for $4.50 worth of gas.  A $24.50 rental turned into $60 after everything was said and done... because some jackass at the station next to the home depot needed to finish his smoke, and took his sweet ass time doing it.

Let me pump my own gas damn it.

Oh, and years ago, when I was in my 20's, and was driving nice expensive cars around as a hobby, it pained me every single time that an attendant wasn't careful and dripped gas all over the side of my car.

"Honestly, Murphy's been kinda the weirdest in terms of this.

He went in this knowing the playbook. Start a think tank, fund the right political machines, and be everyone's friend. He took over NJ dems pretty quick for good reason. He seemed pretty knowledgeable about how the system works.

That being said, him in office is a complete 180. I think he just had this idea that campaigning is the hard part and governing will be easy. That he'd get in, advance what he wanted as policy, people will sign off on it, and he'll put the right people in who will be hard at work to make it happen. Nope. Government is one giant episode of Parks and Rec, with your fair share of nepotism hires, incompetents, self-dealers, non-practical idealists, power fetishists, and just plain bigots/scum of the earth. Nothing makes this more clearer than the marijuana legalization issue, where he actually thought Sweeney and the political machine were going to pass it without a public referendum.

"The law says you can't pump it yourself, but you can open your cap and place it on the appropriate hanger for your car. I do it all the time. I even start the payment process to help speed up the process for the vehicles behind me. But I don't touch the nozzle, even though I could probably do so without recourse since I'm a former volunteer firefighter. 

Additionally, I have a nicer car that has been in car shows myself. I have always filled up the days before or right after the event. Plus if you are a regular, I'm sure you know about quick detailer solutions. And of course, I'm sure you also know about the dust layer that occurs when a vehicle is parked overnight. My only point is that your car can and will get dirty overnight, even without a gas fill, which can obviously be done on a different day than the show.

"Vegan dude here, it's hard enough to find vegan restaurants in most of NJ (except down the shore, lots down there, ex. Asbury Park is solid). But, what you can do is pick cuisines that are easy to find vegan food in. 

Example, Thai food (they typically don't use dairy, it's all coconut milk, ie. in curries, and they all have tofu, although pad thai traditionally has egg in it, gotta order without it), Chinese food (lots of noodles and vegetables and they usually have tofu), and Mexican food (rice, beans,  guac, all that stuff - just make sure she requests no sour cream or cheese) and if you look up the menu in advance, a lot of them have vegan options as well, sofritas made with tofu and all that.

Indonesia is the birth place of tempeh so if you can find any Indonesian restaurants, I'm sure they'd have some good stuff as well.

Italians restaurants are usually the absolute worst because they won't have tempeh or tofu or beans so you're kinda screwed - _however_ a lot more italian places (especially pizzerias) have introduced non-dairy cheese, and few but some have introduced plant-based meat which is awesome.

Good luck, let us know where you land!

EDIT: Oh snap! I didn't realize there was a Veggie Heaven _somewhat_ close to you. It's in Denville. I've only been to the location in Montclair and it's my favorite restaurant ever. It's basically an entire Chinese food menu, all vegan. It's spectacular.

Rahway murder of  

The Rahway murder of 1887 is the murder of an unidentified young woman whose body was found in Rahway, New Jersey on March 25, 1887. She is also known as the Unknown Woman or the Rahway Jane Doe.

Rahway murder of 1887

Born1865 (approximate)StatusUnidentified for 134 years, 11 months and 27 daysDiedMarch 24 or 25, 1887 (aged 18-22)

Rahway, New Jersey

Cause of deathHomicide by sharp and blunt forceBody discoveredMarch 25, 1887Resting placeRahway CemeteryOther namesThe Unknown Woman
The Rahway Girl
Rahway Jane DoeHeightApproximately 5 ft 2 in (1.57 m)
Four brothers traveling to work at the felt mills by Bloodgood's Pond in Clark, New Jersey early one morning found the young woman lying off Central Avenue near Jefferson Avenue several hundred feet from the Central Avenue Bridge over the Rahway River.[1] Her body lay at the side of the road in a pool of blood that had frozen in the cold. Her throat had been cut twice from ear to ear, her hands were wounded, and the entire right side of her face was extensively bruised from a terrible beating.[2]
The footprints surrounding her body were said to be ""huge.""[3]

DescriptionEdit
The woman appeared to be in her early 20s, and was described as attractive, with brown hair and blue eyes. She was found clad in a dark green cashmere dress that had been trimmed with green feathers and a fur cape to protect from the cold. She also wore yellow kid gloves, what were described by the papers as ""foreign good shoes,"" a black hat made of straw with red-colored velvet trimmings adorning it, a black dotted veil, and a bonnet. She had carried a basket of eggs. Other belongings were found in the Rahway River.

AftermathEdit
Her murder was the subject of national headlines and hundreds came to view the body.[4] Investigators had her embalmed body photographed dressed in the clothes she was found in and these images were circulated widely, but neither she nor her killer were ever identified. Rahway police still have the original photographs taken of her body, which were among the first to be taken as evidence by a police department.[5]
She was buried in May 1887 next to the Merchants' and Drovers' Tavern in Rahway Cemetery.[6]
Her ghost is said to haunt Rahway Cemetery.[7]
At the time of the woman's murder, Francis Tumblety, one of the many controversial purported suspects in the Jack the Ripper slayings (according to Ripperologists) was living in New York City. New York City is twenty miles from the site and one could travel from there to Rahway in roughly 35 minutes; therefore at least one historian has speculated as to the theoretical possibility that Tumblety is connected to the murder.[8]

"Murphy said he would sign legislation to legalize marijuana as soon as it hit his desk, with his hopes that it would happen in the first 100 days.  
Meaning that since he can't do it himself, he would sign the legislation as soon as our representatives wrote it up and he would like for them to do it fast.  
  
This re-phrasing of his promise to 'recreational marijuana will be legal within 100 days' is just wrong. It's really annoying hearing it repeated over and over again.

"Paterson industrialized so early it had its rise and decline before the rest of the area and rust belt began to decline. It is like 2 stages beyond and forked away from other areas lifecycle as a city. It's heyday was the late 1800s, and comparatively to the rest of the country it was an advanced place to be in the early 1800s. By 1920 other industrial cities had already completely eclipsed it and factories were leaving. It's economic cycle was basically out of sync with the rest of the country, resulting in it missing re-development phases. That's why there's buildings from the late 1800s still around. It's the same reason why many NJ towns are *full* of 1920s homes before the Cape Cod Craze (which they are also full of). One example is Rutherford. 

NYC and Newark were also an early industrial city but not quite as early as Paterson, since they focused more on the freight and harbor industry at first (aka shipping). Then between 1900-1950 NYC and Newark became a manufacturing powerhouse. Between 1950 and 1975 a significant portion of industry left then the 80s killed most of what was left. This is why there were so many derelict factories, smokestacks, and cranes dotting the NJ harbor skyline for 30 years.

"Since when have the police ever been about promoting public safety? Their entire goal is to protect the property of the wealthy. SCOTUS has even ruled they have no legal duty to respond to emergencies, only to investigate after the fact. Let that sink in for a moment; your tax dollars pay their salary, *and they have no requirement to come help you if you're in an emergency.*  So, uh, not sure where you're going with this, but it's not the right direction. 

The one time I've ever had to call the cops (living in the less-wealthy half of town) when a crackhead was trying to break down my door, they never showed. Cops aren't there to protect you. They're there to protect the property of the wealthy. Oh there was that one time they showed up; I got a flat on the highway in the middle of the night trying to get home one time. Cop showed up, ran my plates, and instead of letting me change my fucking tire, hassled me for TWO FUCKING HOURS about why I was in [state redacted] when I live in [different state redacted]. Not once did the pig offer to help, set up any sort of traffic safety (this highway had barely any shoulder, I was forced to take up part of the right lane while broken down), and left before I could fix the car. Yeah, super helpful. Public very safe. 

ACAB.

"Your only buying a cheaper house in the far interior of PA, WHERE NO ONE WANTS TO LIVE. I already proved that a similar size house in NJ and PA can have almost identical taxes for the same size, you are just choosing to ignore it. 

PA schools aren't nearly the same (#24 vs #1), there are virtually no beaches, no mass transit (outside of the major cities), etc. You might as well be comparing NJ to KY or MS. Look, NJ has the highest property taxes ON AVERAGE, no doubt about that, but PA doesn't hold a candle to all that NJ offers. And you can easily find lower property tax rates in NJ when you look at the town data and not just averages. If NJ wasn't 2.5x more desirable (on average), people wouldn't be paying 2.5x the average price for a house here vs PA. 

Just to prove that life isn't always cheaper in PA, feel free to Google the current gas tax rate. PA is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than NJ. Or what about the alcohol tax?

Unemployment offices haven't answered a phone call since the pandemic started I know ppl who are accepted with no orobkemd waiting 4 months now without getting paid all they need is an agent to click the ""paid"" button.

All these problems were obviously going to happen because there was zero infrastructure in place before the lagalize weed bill was passed. That's why no one is ready. This is also why even the most basic of bills take so long to get passed because they usually don't without the infrastructure being ready for it.

What I really want is a cabin or small house on a few acres, semi-secluded...and a large outbuilding to build a real workshop.  The space to have a woodworking shop, blacksmithing forge...enough land to have a decent sized garden, some animals (chickens, goats, bees).  Not off-the-grid homesteading completely......just to be able to be off the beaten path a little bit.  I want to tinker in my shop, not be able to hear my neighbors....or traffic.

"That's not even close to being conspiracy territory and probably has some kernels of truth, especially with how NJ politicians boasted about trying to handle it ""like California"".  

Biggest problem with California is they went ages with failed efforts for full legalization, relatively low voter turnouts, and all sorts of other half ass things that at the end of the day only allowed medical industry and other industries to become full on monopolies and push tons of anti legalization efforts to not cheat out their profits.


I feel like now we're in that weird limboland California had where the bar for getting a medical card is pretty low and there's so much of a push to have people overpaying on the absurd medical shop prices. Seriously it's genuine highway robbery going that route and you're better off supporting your local hippie lady in Sussex or Hunterdon than jacking around with shops.

"You got the ticket in NY on a NJ DL. You need to call the court where you git the ticket at and ask them if you can pay the ticket with paying extra for the fine not receiving any points on your license. I know in NJ they do that but NY might not do that and since it is an out of state moving violation may not apply to not get points on your license. I can tell you though if they do the pay extra no points it's going to cost you big bucks. You also need to ask them if they have that program if it applies to out of state residents.

I was in a municipal court in NJ one time fir a license plate frame violation that the judge was going to fine me 75 dollars on. The license plate frame was a dealer frame where I bought the car. I asked to talk to the prosecutor and after I did the judge had the court room cleared because everyone was taking the zero point deal and costing them about 400 dollars.

As for my violation the judge reduced it from 75 dollars to 25 dollars after I showed him photographs of POV police vehicles with the same violation and POV police cars with illegally tinted windows and said the news media will have a field day uf I were to show them the photos as well as my srory.

POV police vehicle is a privately owned vehicle owned by a person whose employed as a cop. Some may have FOP license plate frames that violate the NJ motor vehicle laws but they never get pulled over for the violation and uf they do they just flash their badge, both cops have a laugh and not issued a summons. The same happens for illegally tinted windows. It basically means that cops are above the law. I also know this happens having law enforcement in my own family who gave illegally tinted windows on their cars and had gotten pulled over, flashed the badge and no ticket was ever issued. It's not right that they can get away with that and even some marked state trooper vehicles have illegally tinted wondiws.",t2_xuqjwq1,FordMan100,0,1648221717.0,0,t1_i22pkwh,i22pkwh,False,Edwardoguetta,t3_tnd8kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/tnd8kc/speeding_ticket_out_of_state_of_nj/,Speeding ticket out of state of NJ,/r/newjersey/comments/tnd8kc/speeding_ticket_out_of_state_of_nj/i22pkwh/,2,r/newjersey,0,2

"Have you ever heard of a sundown town? There is a national database to remember these places by. African American Motorists used ""Green Books"" which listed safe restaurants, taverns, and road houses. Clark was a known sundown town. Even after overt Klan activity ended, these people didn't up and move, and the people that located in these areas did so for a reason, not by chance. Now racism takes the form of police pulling you over for no reason because they think you 'don't belong'. Local businesses make you feel uncomfortable, store clerks watch you while you shop, etc etc. I agree the KKK is not the organization to be fearful of these days, much of this activity has moved to pseudo militias like the Proud Boys. You won't see a confederate flag, but if you see an American flag flying 24/7 365 you can bet some wack jobs live there. Every normal person knows you only fly the flag on holidays.

"Ex-NJ WA stater here. Been watching this with interest. 

In WA, we instated legal recreational with competence even though it was uncharted waters. We gave regulatory authority to the liquor board (now the WA State Liquor and Cannabis Board). 

It still took almost two years to get all the ducks in a row: production, distribution, retail, tax control, legal. A year after retail was in full operation, the black market still operated because retail prices were too high. It took a further two years of market efficiencies to gain parity with the black market, at which point it all but evaporated. 

All in all, it was three years from legalization (2012) until some kind of thriving retail market (late 2015). Another year or so until the industry was mature enough to stabilize. If NJ doesn't get its act together, its journey will be much longer. Much, much longer. 

All I can say is this: when retail gets rolling, buy from them. Yes, it will cost a lot more than street weed. Do it anyway. If you shirk the retail industry in its infancy the forces of prohibition will point to that as a failure and the whole thing will fall in on itself.

Right, they own and exploit the land and thus contract supply. There could be houses there! How dare those farmers work the land to their own benefit!

>I guess we differ in our views judging by your comment about all basic necessities being capital assets.

Correct, because you don't understand what an asset is. An asset doesn't have to be privatized or subject to a profit motive or monetized. Water is indeed a capital asset. If you don't have it nothing else works. Nestle's profiteering - which is indeed evil - is irrelevant to the fact that water is indeed bought and sold, even between municipalities. Water rights are regulated, etc. But to put it very simply in the face of such a complex concept - water is capital, and you spend it to live. You also spend it on coffee grounds, pasta, potatoes, cleaning, etc. It's capital, it's an asset.

">We don't live in a capitalist society, we live in an oligarchic society

The two are not mutually exclusive and some would argue oligarchy couldn't exist without capitalism. It was after all autocrats and oligarchs who invented the concept of private land. You're familiar with Robinhood I am sure. At any rate, you are confused: Capitalism is a form of economic governance and oligarchy is a characteristic of political government.

>things don't get banned because it's bad for the local economy, things get banned because they are irrelevant or not profitable to a certain class of people.

Both have and continue to occur, and the classes of people that benefit or are disadvantaged by a thing that becomes banned are at all levels of society. I expect your knee jerk reaction is to scream ""Lies!"" but if you think about it and look for examples you'll quickly find it's true. Furthermore things that are bad for local economies tend to be bad for the people at the top of the heap in those locales - aka your oligarchs. Hence things being bad for local economies getting banned. Of course, since we have local counsels and boards of trade and associations in charge of local government and such things as zoning you're idea of some pyramidal scheme of corruption is only occasionally correct, and those places tend to be glaring examples wrong and end up becoming corrected over time.

> I was saying that if people and corporations are stopped from hoarding properties as economic investments, they might become a little more affordable.

Perhaps that's what you meant to say, and that is a more reasonable position, and touches on issues of corporate personhood and so on. Artificially contracting supply to drive up prices on a necessity is indeed something that should be addressed. And recently has, to Zillow and Redfin's detriment, but that is not what Mr. Turd was expressing.
