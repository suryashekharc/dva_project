"2000sqft 100 year old house here. Been dealing with sealing up the house for the last 5 years. All your heat is being sucked out of your house somewhere.

Columbia gas is just like any energy company, rolling in money and just keep hiking rates. The last rate hike went in place in Dec 21.

Call Columbia gas and ask them to provide you with a home energy audit. For free or for a minimal amount, someone will come out with an infrared camera and tell you where all your heat is leaking out of the house.

We have a fireplace that was literally ripping all the heat out of the house. I went up on the roof to install a liner and cap, when I looked down the chimney I got blasted by 70 degree air like I was looking into a fan. We installed a fireplace woodburning insert and it sealed up that leak. Cracks around doors, windows, window moldings, base board, the list goes on and on. Attic insulation make a huge difference. Some genius installed a ‚Äúhouse fan‚Äù which has caused all kinds of problems, both heat leaving through the attic and cold coming in.

We switched to the yearly payment plan, it‚Äôs about $170 every other month.

"no, because he didn't? what history book did you read?

no, Hitler was inspired by Mussolini. Mussolini's Regime was really one of the first major Fascist dictatorships. The CSA existed from 1861-1865, the earliest Fascist movements were in France around the 1870s/1880s and were thought to be branched off the Jacobin movement. The French Government under Napolean III could be seen as one of the first Fascist Parties, though through the early 1900s many smaller groups appeared, especially after WWI.

Mussolini made it ""mainstream"" in a sense. he used his power to take total control over Italy and expanded his territory (Ethiopia and later an attempt on Greece). Hitler saw how Mussolini's regime worked and used it as a basis to restructure the Nazi party into his own dictatorship, using many of the same ideas/tactics as Mussolini to expand and seize power.

the Confederacy did none of those things. Didn't censor the media, Jefferson Davis wasn't a dictator (major clue), the CSA never really had plans to invade and take over the North, its people weren't brutally suppressed (slaves were, but not general public). The South seceded because of Slavery and to separate from the Union's increasingly strict policies it had places on the South as result, they Rebelled, it wasn't a fascist movement.

so go on and tell me how the Confederates were fascist. what do you mean by ""still are"". i'm confused, this is 2022 right?

"I started to say that if you have to ask, you don‚Äôt deserve an answer. After all, how could anyone not know such significant information - unless they were willfully blind?

But on second thought I think you deserve an answer after all. You are a victim of aggressive pharma PR just like the rest of us. You probably have no idea that your Google and Brave and DDG search results are all aggressively tailored and pre-selected. You are not aware the pharmaceutical companies are the biggest PR, advertising, and lobbying spenders in human history, which gives them control over basically everything you‚Äôre allowed to see and hear in the media. 

You are not aware of the deep connections between pharma, regulators, and public health - or the fact that pharma effectively controls the CDC and the FDA. You probably didn‚Äôt even know the CDC is privately funded.

"Replying to self for additional info. 

Some other ideas to check out. The Hagerstown Roundhouse Museum (i volunteer there on occasion) is a good place to learn about Hagerstown's railroad history. In City Park, there's the city's railroad museum, which has the sole surviving ""road"" type steam locomotive from the Western Maryland Railway (K2 class 4-6-2 Pacific #202).

"Disclaimer, this will be alot, lol. i'm a railfan and know a few places in and around Hagerstown. For starters, there are 3 railroads that serves Hagerstown, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Winchester and Western. NS is by far the busiest, they run 20-30 trains a day, CSX sees only about 6 a day, only 2 of which are road trains, and W&W has only 1. 

&#x200B;

For NS:

Norfolk Southern passes through Hagerstown on the former Pennsylvania Railroad (originally Cumberland Valley) from Harrisburg and the former Norfolk and Western from Roanoke. Vardo Yard was the meeting point between the PRR and N&W

There are two spots at either end of Vardo Yard. At the Northend, a section of the old Wilson Blvd (off current Wilson) dead ends at the tracks. if you park at the guard rail, you should be fine. this is a residential street, but all the times i've sat there, i've had no problems. At the South End, there's a gravel pull off on Oak Ridge Dr. While this is actually an access point for the yard, as long as you stay behind the guard rail you should have no problems. 

In town, it's kind of difficult. the Roy Rogers on Burhans Blvd can be a good spot (grab lunch and maybe catch a train if you're lucky), or in the parking lot behind Accela Logistics on W Franklin (if there's no trucks parked). there's a small gravel patch on Church St that might be a good spot, but that's usually occupied by a cop or someone selling stuff from their car. While i wouldn't exactly recommend, the cement plant on Burhans sits right at TOWN Interlocking. if you do choose this spot, do it on weekends when plant is closed. 

Outside of town, catching NS is much easier. Immediately north of Hagerstown is Maugansville. NS rolls through town on a wide curve and trains are usually going at track speed (about 50-55mph). between Maugansville Rd and Village Mill Dr is a parking lot for a couple businesses that is a good spot to sit, or the alternative across the tracks behind the fire station. The parking lot for the baseball fields is a good spot too, but you're below track level. Going across the State Line into PA, the first spot i can think of is Milnor Rd. Milnor is off Williamsport Pike and dead ends at the tracks. At Milnor, you can see NS' Greencastle intermodal terminal. In Greencastle, you can watch from the platform of the former PRR station. The station has a picnic table (Hardees is a block away, lol) and there is a live feed computer that shows where trains are between Hagerstown and Harrisburg (a system called ATCS). the station also has a live webcam hosted by Virtual Railfan and can be watched on youtube (i'll post link at the end of this comment). Between Chambersburg and Greencastle is Marion. Marion has a crossing and a pull off area along Kennedy St. Just north of Marion on Rt.11 is a Mennonite Church, the parking lot is a great spot to watch from. Chambersburg is a bit difficult as NS trains pass through on elevated track. no crossings, they pass over on bridges. there is a bit of railroad history still standing in Chambersburg, the Cumberland Valley Railroad roundhouse and repair shops on Grant St (roundhouse is a farmers market). i will admit, i haven't railfanned much further north than Chambersburg. Boiling Springs has a few spots and there is a railfan deck near Shippensburg, but i don't remember where exactly. 

For NS south of town. i already mentioned Oak Ridge Dr, so south of town Rench Rd is the first location. there's a small gravel patch you can park in (as long as there's no one else there already. this is immediatly south of the yard limit. further south is St. James (around the corner basically). a gas station sits trackside, you can watch from there. Rt. 34 parallels the tracks between Sharpsburg and Shephardstown, if you're lucky you can pace through here. if not, you can stop at ""Antietam"" just south of Sharpsburg, a former N&W station now home to the Hagerstown Model Railroad Museum. the N&W built a spectacular steel bridge over the Potomac River, still used today by NS. the Rumsey Monument offers a great view of the bridge. The Shephardstown station still stands, but is a Dentist office now. Last place i'll mention outside of Hagerstown is south of Shephardstown, Shenandoah Junction. Here, NS crosses over CSX's Cumberland main. as with the trend, a parking lot offers the best spot to watch, and is trackside to both CSX and NS mains. there's places to pull over along 1st street to see NS specifically. I haven't ventured much further south than Shenandoah Junction. 

&#x200B;

For CSX:

CSX operates on the former Western Maryland Railway through Hagerstown. Hagerstown was once home to WM's locomotive repair shops. CSX also uses a very small section of the former B&O to access a scrap yard near Roxbury. 

First things first, CSX is the least busy of the two Class 1s through here. Hagerstown yard serves mostly as a yard for locals to Hanover and Chambersburg. Two daily intermodals (I015 and I016) are the only trains that pass through. The Lurgan Sub to Chambersburg sees 3 trains a day (Westbound I015, Eastbound I016, and Local D773). The Hanover sub to Hanover, PA sees 3 as well (westbound D795, Eastbound D797, and local B702). west of Hagerstown, also referred to as the Lurgan, you can see westbound D721, Eastbound D720, and both intermodals. Local D785 often works industries in town. Up in ""Security"" off Eastern Blvd, local crews work the cement plant and sometimes the scrap yard thats parallel to Eastern. On occasion, CSX will run a train on the old B&O security branch to Conservit metals near Roxbury. I will also mention, there's no guarantee you'll see all 4 ""road"" trains (D720, D721, I015, I016). D720 often arrives in late evening or at night, D721 usually departs for Cumberland in the afternoon. I015 often passes early in the morning, and I016 is often in the afternoon (sometimes D721 has to wait for them). my advice for chasing CSX is to keep an ear out or honestly buy a scanner. I work with CSX (contractor, not a railroader). 

For the Lurgan Sub, starting in Williamsport and working North. At Bottom Rd in Williamsport is a gravel patch you can pull over in. At Hopewell Rd, the parking lot for the Sheet Metal company can be a good spot. Hopewell is a good place to catch both I016 and D721, because if on time, both are often afternoon trains. As far as in town, the Roundhouse Museum parkinglot can be a good place to watch yard crews working and again the Roy Rogers on Burhans. Going north out of town, Beacon Ave (off Pennsylvania Ave) has spot to pull off. In Longmeadow, you can park in the gravel beside the fire station on Longmeadow Road. State Line Rd and Leitersburg Rd both have pull offs near the crossing. In Waynecastle, there's a Model Railroad Club located in an old grain elevator. while tight, their parking lot can be an option (should also mention, Waynecastle road follows the right of way of an abandoned railroad, the interurban Waynesboro, Chambersburg, and Greencastle Railroad). Between Waynecastle and Chambersburg, i'm not really too sure of any other locations. New Franklin may have a spot to sit. But again, if going up the Lurgan to Chambersburg, you're really only going to see I016 in the daytime. D773, the Chambersburg local, usually leaves Hagerstown around 8-9pm. 

For the Hanover Sub. If planning to chase a Hanover train, bet on D795, the daytime westbound from Hanover to Hagerstown (sometimes called B708 if they need a crew change). Most people i know will catch the D795 in Hanover, Gettysburg, Highfield, Smithsburg or Chewsville. If crew change is needed, they'll usually do it in ""Guldans"" just east of Gettysburg or in Highfield. Eastbound D797 here lately leaves around 6pm. 

Special note. CSX will sometimes run a local up NS to Shippensburg, also ID-ed B708 (or KH00 on NS). However, this doesn't run daily, but if you do get lucky to see it, it has a caboose for a backup move from Shippensburg to Culbertson/Letterkenny. If visiting the Roundhouse museum, the Caboose is parked in the cab tracks and visible from the parking lot. 

Winchester and Western. They only run 1 train, a local from Winchester to NS' Vardo Yard. W&W i've only caught by the Mall or in Vardo, i've never actually chased it. Pope Tire on Virginia Ave is trackside, Massey Blvd parallels and if you're lucky to see W&W passing, the parking lot for Dollar Tree is a decent spot. as for catching W&W in Vardo, sitting at Wilson Blvd is the best place. Of note: i don't know W&W's schedule. the times i've seen them was usually afternoon, but i've seen them at night too. 

Hope this helps, hope it's not too overwhelming either, lol. any other questions, you can DM me.

- mRNA ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are not traditional vaccines. They do not work the same way, and they do not have the same effects.

mRNA vaccines have been in development for decades now with billions upon billions of dollars of research.



- Unlike the vaccines you‚Äôre used to, mRNA vaccines are not as effective at preventing infection, transmission, or hospitalization

This must be why the non-mRNA vaccines have worse performance at preventing hospitalization than, for example, the JNJ vaccine. 


- mRNA vaccines occasionally cause serious side effects, though rare.

Fewer than older generation vaccines.


- COVID is not much of a threat to the young and healthy.

42% of adults in the US are obese. The 'young and healthy' is a subset of all americans, and not even a majority. 


- mRNA vaccines have been studied for years, but were never released or used before, because there was evidence of serious long term side effects, ADE, and waning immunity

This is a massive reduction of a very complicated subject, ignoring finance, technology, and history. 


- Distrust of big pharma and government, especially given that these companies are protected from lawsuits

Dont know what to tell you on this one, distrust what you want, but don't distrust something because Breitbart told you to. 


- A belief that immunity from already catching COVID may be enough, or even may be more effective than the vaccine

This is not confirmed, and the measured 6.5x chance of a us individual dying unvaccinated from covid would make this completely negligible in comparison to having the vaccine in the first place. 


- A general distrust of the way the administration skirted the law to create this mandate

"Ohh I definitely would like to recommend the K bar in south cumberland.  It has great burgers, very unique fries and is definitely a dive bar that fits your specifications.  I'm not sure if its the same wait staff as when I was a kid but they used to be these surly old ladies who were actually very sweet when you realised that they teased all their customers.  I honestly thought they hated me until a regular said ""nah that's just sue she's mean to all the people she likes""   

anyway they are only open from 7am til 5pm now but if you find yourself in cumberland on other business for sure check it out.

"One of the last remnants from the hump, the riders shack, as name implies, was used by switchmen and car riders. For those not familiar, a hump is a small hill used to sort rolling stock wity gravity. In the early days, hump riders rode cars down the hill to work handbrakes to slow them down. Mechanical brakes or retarders built into the track largely replaced riders as cars could be slowed down automatically. The shack is located near the crest of the hump and cars would be uncoupled there (the track was behind the shack further into the trees). In the 70s, the WM was absorbed into Chessie System and major train classification was done in Cumberland instead and by the 80s the Hagerstown hump was closed. Much of the hump and ""bowl tracks"" (sorting tracks from hump) was taken up though the shack and a few other structures still remain today including a car scanner and the ready repair shop (light maintenance like wheel or brake repair on freight cars)",t2_4aej6qpc,AGuyFromMaryland,0,1639775303.0,0,t1_hoyvb88,hoyvb88,True,AGuyFromMaryland,t3_riqq5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/hagerstown/comments/riqq5g/buried_in_the_weeds_and_overgrowth_about_halfway/,"Buried in the weeds and overgrowth about halfway in the CSX yard, the old Western Maryland hump riders shack.

"Selling the building for a $1 and the parking lot for 400K.... Doesnt seem to be an arrangement that's good for the people.  First the city should have leased the property for 10yrs.  If that wasn't an option I would have leased it for 50yrs at a rate of $1 per mouth.  The parking lot is more valuable because of size.  So I would have done a $100 per mouth lease on the lot.  The company needs to spend capital to renovate the building and as long as Hagerstown Historic society doesn't screw this one up (reference HAgerstowns Fair Grounds) that buildings renovation should be a great addition to the city.  But since most business's dont last 20yrs, the owner can now sell the building and property at a significant profit after renovation.  in 20yrs that building + lot will easily be worth more than the 1.5million the new owners is stating he's going to spend.  So If the city stays with its original financial plan for this deal, the citizens of Hagerstown will loose out tremendously.... Oh think so?  What about the Hagerstown Conference Center on Duel Highway.  Nothings been done and a full renovation has to be done to bring it back up to code.... that's millions in itself...

"Do you even read the stuff you post? Regardless I am done discussing this. Vaccines get updated and eventually covid will need to update.

>Current Covid-19 vaccines (either mRNA or viral vectors) are based on the original Wuhan spike sequence. Inasmuch as neutralizing antibodies overwhelm facilitating antibodies, ADE is not a concern.

"Well for one thing, many people are pro vaccine (like me) but opposed to forcing this particular jab on people. 

The reason is usually something like this:

1. mRNA ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are not traditional vaccines. They do not work the same way, and they do not have the same effects. 

2. Unlike the vaccines you‚Äôre used to, mRNA vaccines are not as effective at preventing infection, transmission, or hospitalization 

3. mRNA vaccines occasionally cause serious side effects, though rare.

4. COVID is not much of a threat to the young and healthy. 

5. mRNA vaccines have been studied for years, but were never released or used before, because there was evidence of serious long term side effects, ADE, and waning immunity

6. Distrust of big pharma and government, especially given that these companies are protected from lawsuits

7. A belief that immunity from already catching COVID may be enough, or even may be more effective than the vaccine

"It was until the 1950s. The railroads that served Hagerstown are long gone, their successors don't offer passenger service. Norfolk Southern won't allow passenger service on their main anymore. Their line is single track from Shepherdstown to Hagerstown, and again from Hagerstown to Greencastle. The Washington County branch, which gets a proposal every year or so, would need several million just to rebuild. B&O tore up the rails when it abandoned the branch in the 80s, and has since been developed over in some areas, and the bridge over Antietam creek is gone. Not to mention some of grade needs reworked and new crossings made. They would have to regrade entirely in a few spots to accommodate longer passenger cars. The only actually viable option would be CSX from Cherry Run. But there again, CSX doesn't want the hassle of MARC running on the Lurgan. I dont ever see passenger service returning.

"Here is the story if the link does not work for you:

Hagerstown will move forward with its plans for a multimillion dollar indoor sports facility, despite calls to slow down the project.

The Hagerstown City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to enter into an agreement with¬†Eastern Sports Management¬†to develop the structure, along with authorizing city staff members to prepare a demolition contract for Municipal Stadium, which is on the Memorial Boulevard property where the structure will be built.

Sen. Paul Corderman, R-Washington, spoke to the group prior to the vote, requesting the council meet with Downtown Baseball LLC, the investment group pursuing a new¬†multiuse baseball stadium¬†at Summit Avenue and West Antietam Street.

He cited a letter he sent to the council prior to Tuesday‚Äôs meeting about the groups talking, but the letter was not publicly available as of Wednesday afternoon.

Corderman said it was important for the groups to work together and for the council to have as much information as possible before moving forward.

Councilman Krisitin Aleshire said he understood the ‚Äúpotential dilemma‚Äù the group may be in as the city moves forward with its own project, but that Municipal Stadium was outdated.

He said that with an estimated 18-month construction period and a proposed opening date in the fall of 2024, the city had to keep on track with its current schedule.

Aleshire said Corderman was not participating in the vote and should ‚Äúsit down.‚Äù

Councilman Bob Bruchey said he supported the indoor sports facility, but moved to table the motion until the groups could meet and talk.

The motion failed to get a second and Bruchey, along with the other four council members, voted to approve the $70,000 contract with Eastern Sports Management to develop drawings, a business plan and other details of the complex.

The money will come from the city's fiscal year 2021 general fund surplus.

Early estimates for the new indoor turf facility were around $7 million, but it is now estimated to cost between $10 million and $20 million, according to city officials.

The city will be responsible for tearing down Municipal Stadium, which will cost about $100,000.

Mayor Emily Keller said she was unsure of an exact date, but that there would¬†be a conversation between the city and the Downtown Baseball group.

Herald-Mail Media recently sold¬†its longtime headquarters at Summit Avenue and West Antietam Street, making way for development of the¬†other sports facility. The Herald-Mail will continue its news coverage of the Tri-State area.

The¬†Summit Avenue project is¬†being billed as a multipurpose facility that would mainly serve as a minor league baseball park. Other events such as outdoor concerts could be held there, officials have said.

The city is not providing funding for the project.

The state legislature, earlier this year, gave the Maryland Stadium¬†Authority¬†permission to allocate¬†up to $59.5 million in bonds¬†for design and construction of the 5,000-seat stadium.¬†Maryland lottery proceeds will be used to pay debt service on the bonds.",t2_hn1ad,Vitamin_CMB,0,1635437621.0,0,t1_hieagnd,hieagnd,True,Vitamin_CMB,t3_qhqgdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/hagerstown/comments/qhqgdk/multimillion_dollar_indoor_sports_facility_gets/,"Multimillion dollar indoor sports facility gets the go ahead, project to start soon.",/r/hagerstown/comments/qhqgdk/multimillion_dollar_indoor_sports_facility_gets/hieagnd/,4,r/hagerstown,0,4

"Yes Antietam has many plans if you don't stream or have a big family I stream and have a wife n kid that watch streaming services all day so I need a big upload and download, but for a single person 


But I will tell you their service is garbage.

I will also tell you that if you get service at a lower cost and mb/s they will upgrade to the 300 mbs if you complain about the service for 69.00. It's how I went from paying 120 a month to paying 60ish. I got a three year price cap with the ability to extend it another 3 year at that price for just complaining about their lacking service.

"It's a funny, well writen troll based on the urban myth that Satanists (!!!) sacrifice black cats on Halloween. People who worship Satan are extremely rare. Satan worshipers who engage in animal sacrifice are even more rate. Those that sacrifice black cats because, well, their fur is black, simply do not exist. 

I think the myth started in the 80s when there was a big fear of roving Satanists who wreaked havoc on unsuspecting god fearing, Christian communities. It never happened. 

As far as tropes go, black cats have always been associated with witches, not Satanists. Witches didn't sacrifice black cats. Instead, they use them as their familiars.",t2_o9ut,bentcorner,0,1634144058.0,0,t1_hgi4m3r,hgi4m3r,True,Lucien1980,t3_q73bwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/hagerstown/comments/q73bwq/any_black_cats_you_dont_want/,Any black cats you don't want?,/r/hagerstown/comments/q73bwq/any_black_cats_you_dont_want/hgi4m3r/,1,r/hagerstown,0,1

"This is going to be a long post, but it‚Äôs unavoidable. Complex issues require thorough explanations.

>If the vaccine prevented covid then everyone should get it. But it doesn‚Äôt

The vaccines goal is to help prevent people from getting Covid. Is it, or was it ever heralded as being 100% effective? No. So then what‚Äôs the big deal? Let‚Äôs see:

Let‚Äôs focus on only the numbers above. 34 out of 44 people hospitalized for Covid were unvaccinated. Thats a 77% greater chance of being hospitalized if unvaxxed. 3 out of 4 people currently in the ICU for Covid are on ventilators and are unvaccinated. This example shows that if you‚Äôre unvaccinated, and have to go to the ICU for Covid, you have a 75% greater chance of ending up on a ventilator (the 2nd to worst case scenario. The 1st being dead). It also shows that if you‚Äôre vaccinated and have to go to the hospital for Covid your odds of ending up ventilated are only 2%, as opposed to the unvaccinated rate at 6%, a 200% increase.

Clearly, being vaccinated is a great boon to not only keeping you out of the ICU but out of the hospital all together.

This result changes when looking at national averages as this is just one tiny example from one hospital for one month. The National data shows that unvaccinated people are 15x more likely to die from Covid, and 4x more likely to catch Covid in general, as of the end of August this year.

>and 99% of you will be fine either way

In Florida recently, 36% of deaths have been under aged 65 as opposed to 17% in the same week last year. So, more ‚Äúaccurately‚Äù, 63% of us (assuming by your comment you meant younger people) will be fine either way. Nationally on average, Covid has increased your risk of dying by 10%, just by walking around, driving, going to work and living life. That‚Äôs not an insignificant amount.

>Who said it didn‚Äôt work, I guess reading isn‚Äôt your strong suit

You said ‚Äúuseless‚Äù and I extrapolated from that ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work‚Äù.  Semantics?

>Everyone is so brainwashed into believing everyone has to get it to end covid

It‚Äôs looking like there is no end to Covid. You‚Äôll probably need a yearly vaccine shot just like with the flu. The issue is so many people are not getting the vaccine which means more dead people as Covid is more easily transmissible and more deadly than the flu, for all age groups.

I had two family members die within two weeks of one another this past month, a mother and her daughter, both from Covid, both unvaccinated. Were they brainwashed? Yes they were. They were both brainwashed by Fox News and their ilk into believing not everyone has to get the vaccine to end Covid. They believed it was no big deal and they didn‚Äôt trust the vaccine to lessen their symptoms to be one of the 10 out of 44 hospitalized, instead, they were both one of the 3 out of 4 on ventilators.

Too bad for them, their friends, their spouses, their kids and the rest of their family, that it‚Äôs not about belief, but about facts and science.

>Think critically instead of scaring people into getting the vaccine.

If, after reading this, you still feel I‚Äôm not thinking critically, I welcome your retort.

So, does the vaccine 100% prevent Covid? No. Does it work incredibly well at lessening transmission, lessening symptoms and at keeping people from being hospitalized?

">what happened to the one on the ventilator who is vaccinated?

Being vaccinated doesn't make you impervious to contracting Covid. It just improves your chances of developing a severe case of Covid. The numbers reported by Meritus show this. Most of the people in the hospital are unvaccinated. 

Keep in mind, Washington County is a Covid hotspot. As of yesterday, our positivity rate is 8.94%. The statewide positivity rate is 4.37%. Our case rate per 100k is 47.76. The statewide case rate per 100k is 19.91. 

There's not a mask mandate in Washington County. Restaurants and bars are at full capacity. I think people assume that since we do not have restrictions to help slow the spread of Covid, Washington County must be relatively safe. The complete opposite is true. Washington County is one of the worst counties statewide at dealing with Covid. We also have one of the lowest vaccination rates statewide.",t2_o9ut,bentcorner,0,1632402714.0,0,t1_hdykkgv,hdykkgv,False,bentcorner,t3_pt8u0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/hagerstown/comments/pt8u0i/meritus_covid_cases_21_september/,Meritus Covid cases - 21 September,/r/hagerstown/comments/pt8u0i/meritus_covid_cases_21_september/hdykkgv/,3,r/hagerstown,0,3

"Are you looking for a place to stay warm, or a place to sleep?

If a place to sleep, I would first suggest checking prices at Red Roof or similar (usually between $60 and $80, you get a guaranteed room and your own space). 

If you have a car, Walmart will usually allow you to sleep in your car in the far end of the parking lot, especially if you buy something first and stay quiet. Do not leave you car on while you sleep. 

If you need, you can contact one of the shelters on this list to help with temporary housing for the night [https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/city/md-hagerstown](https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/city/md-hagerstown)

If you just want somewhere warm, go to a 24 hour diner like a Waffle House or similar, keep buying coffee and sides. Be polite, they usually let you stay if you order small things frequently.

You could see if there are any cabins available at local campsites, depending on your transportation options.

"Avoid anything on Jonathan St. Also downtown off street parking will be hard to find, and public transportation is largely non-existent if  you want to go anywhere but a mall, and definitely nothing outside the city. I second North side, but also consider places in the South End. There are several large rental complexes just off Dual Highway (rte 40) if standard apartment living is what you're after. Williamsport is just up the road and pretty quiet, mostly residential. Boonsboro is a bit pricy imho.

As for things to do the C&O canal trail system is pretty close by, City Park is very pretty and has a nice art museum and small train museum. The downtown section of Potomac st has a small arts district, centering on City hall and the Library. The Maryland Theater was newly renovated just before Covid and has live shows (or will eventually.) Antietam battlefield is about 13 miles away via rte 65 (South Potomac st becomes Sharpsburg pike and it will take you right there.)

"I have lived in both places and can offer some insight.

The internet in all of Hagerstown/Williamsport is ""high speed"". But it is also very touch and go, with constant Brown outs and whole neighborhoods going without for hours sometimes. Antietam is a tiny company and, quite honestly, we hate it. But there aren't other options in most parts of Washington Co. We both work from home sometimes, and while it causes headaches, it has only ever forced us to call out or miss work maybe once each in 3 years.

Williamsport is smaller, but only adds about 5-10 minutes to your commute for most shopping in Hagerstown. They have a few cute coffee shop/boutique style stores. 

Either can be fairly safe, depending on where you live, just like anywhere else.

Williamsport I felt was more suited to kids. There is immediate river and trail access that most people can just walk to. Great for fishing/hiking/biking. Even seen people with horses out there.

If you want to be in Hagerstown/closer to amenities but not in the city, I would suggest Maugansville. A bit more up and coming and family oriented. Kind of a mix between the two, tends to be quiet.

If you want to have a lot of night life and a lot of shops in walking distance, Hagerstown is the place to be.

So figure out if you want a city, suburb, or small town kind of feel. The communities line up that way personality wise too.",t2_3nhlih5u,HairyHippieHeathen,0,1628254203.0,0,t1_h7xgpyz,h7xgpyz,True,LouisianaSnailMail,t3_oyzkc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/hagerstown/comments/oyzkc6/help_me_decide_hagerstown_or_williamsport/,Help me decide: Hagerstown or Williamsport?,/r/hagerstown/comments/oyzkc6/help_me_decide_hagerstown_or_williamsport/h7xgpyz/,2,r/hagerstown,0,2

"Which I've _never_ seen being used.

The only thing I've seen in heavy use besides the baseball fields and dog park is the basketball court that this skatepark is replacing.

I don't really agree with the reasoning of not building another basketball court nearby.

I do absolutely love the idea of a skatepark in Hagerstown, and I think it'll get some better use out of it than the hockey rink, but I sure hope those other kids at the courts don't feel detached from the whole decision.
