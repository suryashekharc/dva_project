Snorkeling Monterey Bay sounds fantastic, and the pictures make it look like fun, but like other people have mentioned, it leaves out a number of factors that really should be made clear. I have dived in the bay and never seen it as clear as in those pictures. Usually it's about 5-10' visibility and brown water. The kelp is cool, and you see plenty of seals and sea lions and Garibaldi fish. It's not mexico or hawaii in terms of ocean life though. Right now the water is 53 degrees. [https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Lovers-Point/seatemp](https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Lovers-Point/seatemp) will keep you up to date on that. It requires a thick wetsuit, hood and booties. If you are down for that, great, but between that and the swell that is usually a factor, it's not a casual experience. I haven't gone for a long time because that cold gives me a headache, but I hope you can find someone at the dive shops who could take you.

Another really fun thing to do is paddleboard or kayak off Del Monte beach - Monterey Bay Kayaks has gear (wetsuits are a good idea for that too) and can set you up. Maybe they would know someone who can help with snorkeling too, so it might be worth calling them. Playing in the waves while launching and bringing the boards in is really fun .

"my son and wife and I go weekly to Lover's Point.  We have lot of extra gear, although depending maybe not a wetsuit.  Feel free to PM if you'd like to join us.

Also, while the coast waters CAN be treacherous, it isn't necessarily dangerous.

Very few places here are ""hidden dangers"".

Lovers' Point is very safe:  protected waters, shallow, accessible and visible dangers (well, rocks aren't dangerous but they should be swum around with awareness).  And, if you don't leave the immediate beach area it is even safer.

Look at online maps - you'll see how it is a very protected cove.  You can see almost as much within the cove as outside.  You'll see great wildlife:  Sea hares, starfish, urchin, seals, etc.

Mission Beach as an example in Carmel is probably the least safe:  not because it's inherently dangerous; but rather because the dangers are hidden (beach drops off precipitously steeply and has a notoriously strong current, most fatalities in the area are here).

Monterey Beach is probably about as safe as possible:  flat, minimal current, small waves.  However you won't see much except a passing seagull maybe and a few sand dollar beds ... although you probably won't recognize them without knowing :)

Look around, observe the water for ten-fifteen minutes, once you get a feel you'll know if you would want to enter the water.

[edit:  oh, and, yes, it's cold but not unbearable.  Consider:  kids swim all day on the weekends at Monterey Beach and Lovers point without suits.

You can basically just clock in and out when you want so you can choose how many hours to work.

And, like I say, your car will run a lot better if Honda parts are used and the mechanics are trained. The Monterey Dealership is way overpriced since the new owners. And, as I say, they used to hire gangs. For example, I had two hats in the back hatch to give to my sister-in-law who was going through chemo and someone stole them. Then, a mechanic rammed a screwdriver into a CV boot on purpose and I had to pay $1000 to fix it. Someone recommended T&T but I haven't taken my car there. Santa Cruz Honda used to be ok but it's far away.",t2_kyfpgtdv,Technical-Apricot189,0,1647845988.0,0,t1_i1i4auz,i1i4auz,True,littlegrandesmall,t3_thcf6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontereyBay/comments/thcf6f/best_mechanic_for_regular_car_maintenance/,Best mechanic for regular car maintenance,/r/MontereyBay/comments/thcf6f/best_mechanic_for_regular_car_maintenance/i1i4auz/,1,r/MontereyBay,0,1

"Whether or not it's worth it is a very subjective thing. For my daughter and I, it is without a doubt our favorite place to go in the state. We are low income as well, but to us, it's definitely worth it. We spend the better part of the day there, taking a break outside on the ocean side of the place. Personally, I would rather skimp on other parts of my trip to go there. 

There's something like four dozen exhibits, many interactive. They do a lot of good for marine life, pioneering many conservation efforts, and they're the first facility to successfully have great white sharks on exhibit. If you're interested in the ocean and marine life, I recommend it. If you're not, spend your money elsewhere.

"You're so welcome. We are making progress. It's a slow process, but the buyout should reach the court this year. Unless of course Cal Am agrees to sell, but that's not likely.    
Tomorrow, March 15 at 6pm, Cal Am will be asking the CPUC to increase its profit.   
This will increase your bill by 3.18% on top of the coming General Rate Case increases that have already been approved.   
The hearing is public. You can call in to comment at 1 800 857-1917. Pass Code 1673482# and watch at www.adminmonitor.com/ca/cpuc.  
You can submit written comments now at apps.cpuc.ca.gov/c/A2105001. There are NO COMMENTS from the Peninsula as yet.

Yes and no. The PUC regulates their profits and ties that to their assets (the more they have invested in their system, the more money they can make, which does not mean a higher profit %) but they still have sell the water.  They still have to spend money to make money.

I agree with you that publicly owned systems are better, but I hard disagree that it will be cheaper. You're replacing one monopoly with another. The biggest difference is it'll just have an elected board of directors and have meetings where the public can comment.

"Post No Bills in Sand City (they usually have a food truck outside, but you can also bring your own food) or Alvarado Street Brewing Company are great options for beer. ASBC is a brewery, PNB, a taphouse. If you like sours, check out Yeast of Eden in Carmel by the Sea (sours branch of ASBC). Last time I was there (pre-Covid) they also had a really unique and delicious spirit called Trakal.

Alta Cafe for great coffee. Counterpoint Coffee in Seaside is good if you like light roasts (not my thing, but they were highly recommended to us). I've also heard great things about Acme Coffee (also in Seaside) but haven't made it there yet.

There are so many fantastic restaurants in the Monterey area, but to name a few that my husband and I especially enjoy:
- International Cuisine - PG restaurant with a solid international menu. They'll be donating all sales through March 15th to Ukraine (they have strong ties there
- La Tortuga - small Mexican restaurant in Seaside with Oaxacan specialties (if you have someone to share it with and/or a large appetite, highly recommend the Molcajete)
- Noodle Bar - popular Vietnamese restaurant in Marina
- Hula's - fantastic food, especially the fish tacos
- Sushi Fly - somewhat limited menu compare to a lot of sushi places, but great quality
- Won Ju - delicious Korean food
- Dametra Cafe - Mediterranean & middle eastern cuisine in Carmel by the Sea owned by the brother of International Cuisine's owner. Great food and a wonderful atmosphere. One of our favorite spots to celebrate special occasions.

"Cal Am has owned water rights to the Carmel River alluvial for over a 100 years (I believe).  The county recently did an audit for what it would cost to buy them out and determined it would cost the taxpayer more than it would to just keep the high Cal Am bill.  Cal Am also has had multiple large projects in the works in the past decade or two (a huge silt issue with the San Clemente Dam, and building a desal plant). On top of this we just implemented new eco regulations that drastically alters the amount of water Cal Am can draw from the Carmel River (so way less supply).  There are also 'too many cooks in the kitchen' when it comes to all the local governing bodies (everyone wants something different and we can't come to an agreement that would benefit us all).

[This source](https://cityofmarina.org/935/Cal-Am-Desalination-Project) is city of marina and going to be biased against the project, but they do point out that in 1996 the property was annexed under a binding agreement with specific provisions preventing groundwater use and it seems like Cal Am just tried to ignore that provision.

I think what happened was once the coastal commission got involved and started opposing it Cal Am withdrew their permit application.

I'm glad that you've managed to let yourself be above it all, but the amount of traffic in this town is just absurd. Unless you're going somewhere at 4 am, there is *always* traffic full of people not driving  correctly. It doesn't matter what day of the week it is or time of the day it is; there's no reprieve. It's made me hate to leave my house. I don't go take advantage of half of the beautiful things Monterey has to offer knowing I have to drive to get to them and am going to have to deal with the headache of driving and parking and crowds. Maybe not a big deal to you, but we like what we like and we dislike what we dislike. I hate it when I have to leave work in the middle of the day for a doctor or dentist appointment or whatever, and it's never just a quick trip across town because there are too many people on the road no matter what time of day it is.

"Just because someone has a different perspective doesn't mean their thoughts are toxic, just saying.

""However, if that vehicle in front of you is doing the maximum speed limit, they are not impeding you because they're going as fast as the speed allows them under the law,"" Pennings said. ""So just because somebody is not going as fast as you want them to go... does not mean that that person has to move out of your way.""

"I used to live in Seaside and paid for water through cal am and yeah it was super expensive, twice as much as I'm paying now in Marina. The way I understood it was there was a lot of delayed infrastructure work because while I lived in seaside they had to tear up all the roads and replace water mains and rates had to be jacked up to compensate for that.

Cal am also wants to build a desal plant at the old cemex plant  but they were blocked by the city of Marina and the coastal commission.  Did they ever start pumping non-potable water out to cal am areas? I Believe that not long ago Black horse bayonet and some of the other golf courses were being watered with potable water.

The water treatment plant in Marina, Monterey one water or whatever it's called has offered to sell potable water to calam but they keep trying to insist on building a desal plant.   I don't really remember the exact figures but I believe Marina was pushing for an agreement where calam would subsidize building out the Monterey one plant for more capacity and be able to deliver water at a cheaper rate per gallon. The problem is they're trying to put the desel plant on property in marina where they don't have well rights.  Their plan isn't to take straight seawater, It's to take brackish water from the buffer aquifers which experts are concerned will promote saltwater intrusion and compromise the wells and marina.",t2_nr8t1,sploittastic,0,1646877330.0,0,t1_i01xkv6,i01xkv6,True,SavageDarkLord666,t3_tajgww,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontereyBay/comments/tajgww/can_someone_explain_the_water_situation_in/,"Can someone explain the ""Water Situation"" in Monterey.",/r/MontereyBay/comments/tajgww/can_someone_explain_the_water_situation_in/i01xkv6/,5,r/MontereyBay,0,5
