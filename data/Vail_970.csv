"I think Vail Resorts gets a lot of blame unfairly for the conditions around here. NIMBY's and trying to keep these communities exclusive for the wealthy is a huge source of a lot of problems, along with a lot of economic protectionism.

Almost impossible to open a food truck / food cart in the community because they explicitly don't want competition with the restaurants -- so we're limited by selection and time. A falafel cart by the covered bridge until 2 am or later would be a huge boon for this town, but that's not going to happen any time soon. Gotta stick with shitty pizza and overpriced, underperforming attempts at European food. Some more mixed use properties/zoning to help increase business diversity, affordability, and improve housing access -- not gonna happen, that'll compete with existing real estate, etc. Why let people pay $1200 for rent when you can force them into $2400/month?

"Until the state and local communities address zoning laws **and** investors that drive up housing/rental prices (private equity/non-local investors/short-term rentals) then housing doesn't change. And, while the state has a lot of power, I've seen a lot of communities where the city council or board of trustees have opted to support development and housing by wealthy investors into their communities rather than affordable housing for all income levels.

There are not many affordable housing options (1/3rd of monthly *after-tax* income) for median income households and below. Hell, even households slightly above the median income threshold have few options in most communities. And building $400k+ new developments doesn't do anything for those households because the base payment for a $400k house is still out of the affordable range for a median-income household.",t2_nuiso,hereditydrift,0,1645384916.0,0,t1_hxqlgta,hxqlgta,False,jaredpolis,t3_svamqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/vail/comments/svamqp/gov_jared_polis_in_edwards_on_housing/,"Gov.

"I don't recommend flying into Denver. That's a recipe for disaster if it snows, and you'll spend hours in transit. Fly into Eagle. Let me say that again -- always fly into Eagle.

Ski rentals are a commodity. Rent from wherever. Christy's is the big name in the area, but it doesn't really matter.

Outdoor seating in Colorado in winter is rough. You are going to find zero COVID precautions here. This is a very liberal area, but we're totally done with this. Case counts are lower than any time since last summer. We all got the omicron over Christmas. But since you asked...

Garf's and Bart & Yetis in Lionshead has outdoor apres. El Sabor and Blue Moose Pizza are quieter, cheaper options on the side. In Vail Village, the Red Lion is a popular tourist apres ski location with outdoor seating. If you're looking for amazing food and a higher end experience, make an experience at Alpenrose -- but honestly their indoor ambiance is part of the experience.  


EDIT: El Segundo is an upscale taco place in Vail Village with excellent food and drinks. I don't know that I've ever seen their outdoor seating used in winter other than last year. Maybe as the weather warms? I don't go there very often in winter. If you're after pizza in the village, Vendettas is the play. Their outdoor seating is accessed on the back side off Wall St -- where the stairs go down keep high right. If you just want beer outside, 7 Hermits Brewery has mediocre at best beer, but decent crowd watching. Vail Chophouse and Tavern on the Square in Lionshead has nearly slope-side seating, but outdoor seating closes around 4pm.",t2_n1nqz,SkiMWV,0,1645075976.0,0,t1_hx9v5ee,hx9v5ee,True,richinbos,t3_su6zc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/vail/comments/su6zc1/vail_shuttle_rental_barrestaurant_ideas/,"Vail shuttle, rental & bar/restaurant ideas",/r/vail/comments/su6zc1/vail_shuttle_rental_barrestaurant_ideas/hx9v5ee/,2,r/vail,0,2

There are a lot of other places that have outdoor dining but in more limited capacity. The Town of Vail has allowed a lot of restaurants to have outdoor dining more in the streets than ever before.

"Vail has a pretty good epic mix app for lift lines. Check that out if you don't want to wait.

Really just go all over as conditions dictate which side is better. You know the park is always going to be the park and always good. Try a couple of runs on the front then try a couple of the back back and you decide which one you like better for the day.

Vail is so massive and I would suggest to just explore. Go back the blue sky and take in the sights. Bring a grillable lunch with some beers and post up in Blue Ski if the mountain is not that great.

"Absent unusual circumstances (mechanical issues, wind holds, etc.) or a powder day, you will feel like you're hardly waiting in lines at all. 

On a non-powder day, the gondolas actually have a sweet spot around 8:45-9 where it's almost walk up. Even outside of that, you're unlikely to wait more than 10-15 minutes. 

4 Mountain top express is probably the most common choke point from mid-morning until lunch, but you only need to ride it once. 7 Game Creek is an old shitty lift that seems to shut down a bunch and is the only way out of there, so if you're unlucky you can get caught in a mob there. Also happens if there's an evac where they have to load the lift.

Occasionally 36 teacup at the end of the day can get nasty, but that's circumstance based and you really only have to ride it once (or you can avoid it entirely if you use 21 Orient Express to get out). 

People talk about 5 High Noon being bad but I've never seen it bad once all the other terrain is open (it's usually the first bowl to open).

If you have never experienced it before, the Back Bowls are the most unique thing about Vail for someone who hasn't been there before.

Take the Vail village gondola up to chair 3. Take chair 3 up and do a warmup run in Game Creek Bowl - to avoid a long catwalk, I'd suggest Showboat but if you don't mind the catwalk Dealer's Choice.

Take Game Creek chair up and do the traverse into Sun Down bowl to Ricky's Ridge. Take chair 5 to the top and then drop down Milt's Face to Sun Up bowl chair 9. Take chair 9 to the top and come right back down under the chair to the trees by Over Yonder. Take Yonder trees back down to chair 9 (stop at the catwalk otherwise you dump all the way back down to chair 5) and take chair 9 back to the top.

From chair 9 you can either drop into China Bowl's hard side (Ghengis Khan, Jade Glade etc) or ride the ridge into Teacup bowl (Red Zinger, Emperor's Choice). If you drop into China Bowl take the Orient Express lift to the top and run Shangri-la a few times before skiing under Orient Express to Blue Sky Basin. If you do Teacup bowl, hop on the catwalk at the end for 200 yards then take Marmot Valley on the right down to Blue Sky Basin.

Take the Blue Sky Basin chair up and run through Big Rock Park and Cloud 9. Most of the way down either run will be one last chair on your right, which takes you up to Grand Review.

Congrats, by noon on your first day you will have seen 4 or 5 bowls plus Blue Sky and now can pick where you spend the next day and a half.

"Sorry this happened! A couple weeks ago I was at BC (my second day back to skiing post acl) when a skier wiped me out. I almost had a heart attack for a second  when I stopped to assess if I was hurt. Thankfully I wasn’t and I skied down to him and screamed at him. I was frustrated because in the past there are usually some staff members around in this particular area. No one around period. Also, it is COLORADO LAW that if you are involved in a ski collision that you are to stay at the scene until ski patrol arrives and give your name and contact info.

Edit: I think we all need to take personal responsibility and if we see a hit and run, obviously not take matters into our own hands in terms of justice,  but to ski down to this person and make sure they stay at the scene and obtain their contact info.",t2_5adf9sk2,Many-Minute,0,1643647612.0,0,t1_hv0gelt,hv0gelt,True,FueledByFlan,t3_sgnhh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vail/comments/sgnhh0/bc_but_if_you_saw_something_tell_the_cops/,"BC, but if you saw something tell the cops",/r/vail/comments/sgnhh0/bc_but_if_you_saw_something_tell_the_cops/hv0gelt/,2,r/vail,0,2

"I respectfully disagree. Vail Resorts is the largest employer of the entire Vail Valley, and therefore, its corporate decisions impact almost every aspect of the local economy, the Town of Vail and the Vail community. Our ability to put food on the table and clothe our children depends on Vail Resorts. 

Tourists considering a vacation in the Vail Valley (Vail / Beaver Creek) should know what to expect when they spend $9,000+ on a family vacation here this year, including but not limited to, $211 passes, 22% closed lifts (25/32 open), closed restaurants on mountain, long lift lines, limited bathrooms, unavailable ski lessons, and nonexistent propane on mountain decks. 

As an American college intern or full-time working adult seeking employment, considering moving across the country to work for Vail Resorts in the Vail Valley, she should know that real rents average >$1,000 / bedroom in shared housing accommodation, and if that employee cannot obtain employee housing, she should expect to travel as far as Gyspum, Eagle or Leadville with 30+ mile daily commute to the office. She should also expect to earn \~$13-15 / hour pre-tax maximum, much less for a seasoned ski patrol expert also earning such pathetic wages. She should know that her employer depends on 8 seasonal employees for every 1 full-time employee, the majority of which, are cheaper foreign labor in the form of J1 visas. Vail has 6,100 full-time employees (2021) and \~55,000 seasonal workers (2020). I am sorry I cannot find a source for employee concentration in the Vail Valley (Vail / Beaver Creek), but I suspect the Vail Valley Foundation could provide this data.

The livelihood of our families depends on this company. I believe I am exactly on topic and not enough people are speaking frankly enough about the reality of Vail Resorts in Vail the Town. Years ago, we jokingly called Vail ""Swlss Shi$ty,"" but now that term rings a little closer to home and is a lot less funny. I'll concede that perhaps this is the wrong channel to voice my concerns, and if so, I can try to start a separate subreddit devoted to Vail Resorts & the local Vail community. But, I don't believe I have broken any of the 7 rules listed to the right of this page.

"Around Lionshead there is the public library that has a lawn area close to the Gore Creek you can play in. There is also a park in sort of downtown Lionshead but they usually clear all that snow.

If you have a car or are willing to take the bus, I would go over to Donavan Park. They have a wide open soccer field to play on and a full playground. I also second Ford Park; it is a huge field and playground as well.

Finally, there are a lot of areas around the base of the mountain you could easily walk over to and throw some snowballs around.
