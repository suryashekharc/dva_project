"Annadel is pretty rocky. Most riders up there are going to have full suspension. Before you buy, see if there are shops around that have rentals. I'm a repair only shop, no bikes for rent, but I can help advise

If you're new to mountain biking, I would recommend the hard tail. It will help train you to chose your line more carefully and efficiently. That translates to better riding technique in the future.

"There are guys hitting Annadel on gravel bikes, you'll be fine with a hard tail.  That said, it is really sweet to bomb down and just lean back, letting the bike soak up the hits.

"Good times.  I hope you enjoyed your time in the program.  

I was a year zero freshman and the first half of the first year (1995?) we only had printed manuals for the camera they intended to buy. We got equipment by Q3. Gave us time to learn foundations and concepts I suppose.

I can only imagine that program got better once the community TV station was built.


Even though it didn't become my profession, I benefited from it. Years later I apply basic principals of videography that I learned in the program.

"As many other have said, ""are you tolerant of Christians"" is a different question from ""will I be easily accepted if I'm a conservative who wears a cross around my neck and bases his choice of living situation around religion and politics.""

Santa Rosa voted mostly for Bernie in the Democratic primaries, it's pretty liberal. We celebrate our LGBT neighbors and hate it when our police shoot citizens for no good reason or people from out of town come in with lifted trucks and giant flags and cause chaos. But it's also not Berkeley. In fact, nearly every city in the country is 60-80% Democrat and nearly every suburb and rural area is 60-80% Republican: no matter where you're at, getting along with your neighbors is going to require some tolerance and people who make waves will see some resistance.

This all has less to do with how you personally feel about your religion or politics, and more about whether you're nice to people who are different from you. If so, then we can probably get along. As you've hinted at, publicly displaying religious or political symbols invites questions about whether you ascribe to the stereotype you're portraying or not. If you don't like those questions or think your answers might invite conflict, maybe keeping those symbols to yourself might be more wise.

"The UC extension has some resources that can be helpful.

Are you looking to fill the entire thing? 11 acres without equipment or infrastructure is a lot. As I understand it you only need to prep the field once, so you could probably rent equipment for that. Harvesting is going to be the real trick.

You need to look at pest control, gophers being a big one, and irrigation. Young plants of this type need irrigation, and these days even mature plants can't be trusted to the weather. The drought is a bit much to say the least and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. You need drip lines running the whole thing and obviously a water source. Between probably composting, renting equipment, irrigation and the actual plants you're looking at a lot of up front cost. And you're going to be out of time in about a month if you want to establish plants this season.

Farming, as I was just talking to my father about, is a book keeping business. Thinking of it as a business is important. So - do you have a pipeline for selling? Do you know who's buying, and their current prices? How well do you know the market? Are you interested in secondary products, or just selling as a commodity? Do you have a source for starts lined up (I'd avoid seeds)? 

Secondary, value added products are a great choice for direct to consumer sales. But you'll need to have pretty serious expertise to do it right.

There's a lot to it, most of it coming from the business side. There's a big question of how much you want to invest in infrastructure.

Since lavender is a flowering plant with good nectar availability I'd also look into integrating bees. You could probably partner with a bee keeper and get a secondary market out of it.

There's a pretty huge number of variables that really depend on you, your goals and your current knowledge. You can hire a farm manager, but you'll need to understand what you're hiring them to do. And you'll have to be able to predict costs and revenue enough to cover payroll.

If you're not in a position to invest in that kind of equipment, you can start small. Depends on your financial situation with the land and what it cost to hold. But if you want to ease into it, start slow and develop a good farm system before you buy 11 acres worth of starts.

A quick search tells me we have at least one successful farm here, so you should research what they do and how they make it work.

If you don't want to learn farming and just want an investment, lease the land and forget about all of this.",t2_4a0m75no,shredinger137,0,1647845231.0,0,t1_i1i3eby,i1i3eby,True,thirdeyefrozen,t3_tj40c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/tj40c3/need_help_with_planting_lavender_on_a_few_acres/,Need help with planting lavender on a few acres,/r/santarosa/comments/tj40c3/need_help_with_planting_lavender_on_a_few_acres/i1i3eby/,15,r/santarosa,0,15

Next-door honestly would get you more exposure. Also might want to try a charity group like Dogwood. They help rehome all sorts of cats and dogs with foster homes.

"The trick is to keep your faith personal. Express your faith in church, or in your home, or in places where it's already established to be a religious gathering. If you're out in the greater public and announcing that you're Christian and using it as a defining characteristic of yourself, people are going to be put off by it. Some of them because of the very real damage that the church has done in this world, and some because that behavior is approaching ""crazy doomsayer ranting on the street corner"" levels and many people aren't prepared to deal with declarations like that.

You sound to me like your concern is less, ""will I be tolerated for being Christian"" and more ""I'm going to be loud and obnoxious about my faith, and I want to live somewhere where being performative like that won't be shunned"". Whether or not you think that way, it's what I'm gathering from this post.

I don't know you, I've never met you, and I don't have ill will towards you. You sound like you're looking for a place to live that is exclusively your flavor of Christian and one that will accept you entirely. This kind of place doesn't exist though, not outside of a religious compound. There are hundreds of thousands of people in Sonoma County, 40 million+ in California, and not every one of them is going to like and accept you uncritically.

If you want to move to Sonoma County, do it! It's an incredible land and the people are kind, both the secular people and the religious.

Those links have not been updated since 2009 but they show population percents of various religions sufficiently represented in these counties. I do not know how the numbers are derived but they appear to be republishing data from *Religious Congregations and Membership in the United States: 2000*, from the Glenmary Research Center. It's probably data voluntarily submitted by congregation leaders and likely incomplete.

Sonoma County is secular, in public. Expect to treat and be treated by others in as secular manner: polite, friendly, but not in any religious or anti-religious way. I don't encounter anyone expecting a moment of prayer before a non-religious meeting or saying grace before a shared meal in mixed company.

There are a lot of religious assemblies of both Christian and non-Christian faiths so there is a significant percent of faithful but it's a diverse percent which co-exists without any problems that I'm aware of. I have had the occasional co-worker who will talk a little about faith but it never becomes a negative; it's discussed in friendly, respectful ways.

We're also a tolerant community, in general; those on the LGBT spectrum and non-Christian faiths exist comfortably here. People living *non-traditional lifestyles* are accepted members of the community. ""Live and let live"" is a good descriptor.

Signals of personal faith are common and unremarkable. No one will care if you wear a cross or have a sticker on your car.

All weather is taken from two places in Santa Rosa, downtown on third Street and at the airport. Wunderground (short for Weather Underground) takes their reports provided by individuals throughout Santa Rosa, over 300 of them. I can be watching the radar showing where the clouds are in real time and have predicted when it will start raining over our home in East Santa Rosa, accurate within 30 seconds!

"So we are from San Mateo county and are considering Sonoma county because it is much more affordable and has great weather(compared to the cheaper areas eastward). But we are wondering how friendly Sonoma is to Christians and ppl with more traditional views? Here in San Mateo it is live and let live but there is still some negative feelings towards Christians from liberals. People in general are more secular and the area has a more secular vibe to it(with the exception of certain ethnic catholic communities). Now we know that no where in the Bay Area is going to be all that Christian or conservative, but we are wondering where Sonoma falls on the scale? It is just north of Marin, which is even more liberal than the peninsula. Is it as leftist as places like SF or Berkeley or is it more moderately liberal? How are Christians viewed there? How are ppl with more conservative views viewed there? It is a more rural county but it‚Äôs proximity to SF and Marin makes us feel it‚Äôs not going to be all that different.

"A little bit of rain about 7am on the coast. Big disappointment as I was hoping to awaken with the rain falling, but it was dry when I got up at 6am.

I think the weather people always over-predict rain, because its better to say it's going to rain but then it doesn't, than to say it's not going to rain, and then it does!

If you watch the hourly weather prediction you'll often see the rain predicted for a certain block of time get pushed out later and later.

"framing what happened to real estate in the great financial crisis of 2008 as a ""normal"" RE cycle is falling prey to recency bias and likely a great way to screw yourself out of owning. If you can afford to buy now and want to buy, buy. If you can't afford to buy now, it's unlikely prices will shift enough such that you can. You're gonna have to change something about your ability to afford a home (or choose to -- if you can -- start with a less expensive property).

basic supply and demand has ""ceteris paribus"" as a pre-requisite and does not always describe the complexity that exists in real world economies.

"I can safely tell you this as a 50 year old who had the ironically good fortune to have completely destroyed his credit in college and shortly thereafter when he moved to Sonoma county in 1996, and didn't take my credit seriously for another 10 years. That easy buyer situation absolutely devastated the vast majority of my friend's finances. Seriously, crushed them. Yes, they bought homes. Over 2/3rds lost them. It was easy to finance but the shit collapsed like a house of cards. It's one thing to have an admittedly dog shit rent situation in present day. It's an entirely different thing to have a multi six-digit foreclosure on your credit report for the following 7 years. I know it sucks now but I can't tell you how much worse it was for the typical 30-year-old back in 2002 or 2010 who bought in a hyperinflated market a couple years earlier.

Fed announces a planned 7 rate hikes. This is going to put definite downward pressure on home prices around here as mortgages rise and leveraging homes starts to look dangerous.

"SUPPORT THE TEACHERS! FIX THE EDUCATION SYSTEM!

This is so sad to see.

So much for ""leadership"", and what a disappointing situation.

The administration has failed so completely and utterly in managing the economic needs of the district that they should all be fired in shame. 

Being a teacher shouldn't be synonymous with living in poverty. Nor should the administrators of public schools be driving luxury vehicles and taking their outrageously exorbitant salaries while they suck so bad at their job. Make administrator pay be based on the results they deliver for governing and supporting the education system.

How about a salary cut for the admins? They seem to be fine with cutting salaries and denying people a living wage and not funding the classrooms, so lets switch it up and cut salaries of administrators.

Replace the criminally incompetent admins with people who don't take the lion's share of funding for themselves and then squeeze the teachers dry and cancel programs instead of creating growth opportunities, forging creative partnerships with industry, fighting for change in Sacramento, and most importantly, putting the needs of the students first.

It's clear the current group of admins are incapable of performing their due diligence, and our students and teachers deserve better than to have their future and livelihood stolen by incompetent admins who can't even come up with a good excuse for their inability to be effective.

Shame on the admins, glory to the teachers, save the students, and heaven help us all as the people who will be taking over the world get less and less prepared for the challenge.

Dark times ahead for Santa Rosa, and we all get to suffer the rising tide of ignorant and incapable people who are passing through the school system with a certificate of attendance instead of a meaningful diploma.

"Full disclosure, my fiance is a teacher and I've had this exact conversation with her.  If you factor out the total hours worked over the year they actually do fairly well when looking at an hourly wage of 8 hours per day.  On average, a teacher makes about 45 an hour @ 65,000 per year.

Here's where your argument stops making sense though.  1) My fiance spends a ton of her own money on the students for activities, good behavior banks. etc.  2) Teachers spend a ton of time outside the 8 hour work day grading papers, preparing lesson plans, texting or calling parents, etc.  3) The big pensions you speak of are pretty non existent.  The board has removed several of those benefits.  I read further down you knew a teacher who was older and was well off.  Most teaching jobs today don't have anywhere near the benefits they did 20+ years ago when older teachers started.

The biggest issue the teachers are mentioning specifically in Rohnert Park/Cotati is they are 15% below the average pay scale of Sonoma County while admin are at or higher than the average pay scale and have great benefits.  Rohnert Park/Cotati teachers applied to earn higher pay to match the county average and the district replied with a 1 time 6% raise and that doesn't count as their highest pay when they do retire.  It's worth mentioning I'm not 100% sure about the last part but the gist of it is teachers need more money to survive in the county.

To give you a real world example, my fiance is a teacher with 7 years experience and several units up on the salary schedule yet she hasn't broken 60k while teachers in similar districts are at or over 60k.

It honestly sounds like you don't know much about this issue and you know VERY little about benefits teachers get today.  This comment comes off as ignorance.  If you don't understand what people are unhappy about either A) ask in a forum such as this or B) do your own research and come to your own conclusion.",t2_6x4mw,joker231,0,1647360307.0,0,t1_i0riib0,i0riib0,False,AdaLoveLaceLives,t3_te73ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/te73ef/update_62m_in_additional_revenues_but_teachers/,"Update: $6.2M in additional revenues, but Teachers Must Beg for Scraps, $1.62M is too much of an ask!!",/r/santarosa/comments/te73ef/update_62m_in_additional_revenues_but_teachers/i0riib0/,7,r/santarosa,0,7

Yeah, if you have to spend between $35,000  to more than $100,000 to be educated, credentialed and able to teach, then make like $50,000 a year, it's definitely their own fault for not going and getting a CDL and being a truck driver, or a garbage man, or any of these other ""lesser jobs"" that we look down on but pay way better.

But, if it doesn't make any financial sense to be a teacher anymore, then how the heck are our kids going to be literate and cared for? ü§î

If implemented as a land value tax (rather than a property tax) it would primarily fall on land speculators and absentee owners of underused (or even vacant) lots ‚Äî who would then be incentivized to either _do_ something with the land, or sell to somebody who will. 

Anyway, like I said, Prop 13 makes an LVT a non-starter anyway. It really is pretty much some form of sales tax, or nothing. Which is a shame, because those are the worst taxes, from an economic and moral / income inequality standpoint.

I think such services are hugely important and would probably support this anyway, so that‚Äôs not my issue.

Han Bul is where you go if you want the banchan KBBQ experience.

Not a restaurant, but Asiana Market in Cotati is a Korean grocer with fresh produce, jars of kimchi and frozen Korean foods. Every weekend you can find premade food lining one of the aisles.

Last time I was there, the north building was a temporary shelter only for the gates and had cold snacks for purchase inside security. The main older building has a bar/grill outside of security that I'm sure you could waste a few hours at.

No matter what you choose, you're talking about a difference of five minutes either way. You can't exactly jog between the gates, more like run around in circles.

"Sylvia was stationed at Sanctuary House to help homeless teens transition into stable housing. The young man who killed her should never have been placed in Sanctuary House due to his mental health and violent threats he had made numerous times. Because Sonoma County Behavioral Health did not share his medical/mental health records to Social Advocates for Youth, he was placed in Sanctuary House. He broke the rules from the beginning. He made threatening remarks about hurting Sylvia. Sylvia was scared for her safety, but her concerns were ignored. Justice for Sylvia would be to make the county departments accountable for their mistakes and change their policies so that this type of tragedy happens to no other social worker. Justice for Sylvia would be to have her murderer sentenced to life in prison. Justice for Sylvia would be for her children to know she didn't die in vain and that she will never be forgotten.

Santa rosa offers enough of city amenities to keep me happy.
Breweries... restaurants, mechanic shops, groceries, events, etc.
It's self sustained for the most part. No need to travel to far places for services like some other small towns.

Weather is a no brainer. I actually had an accident where i fractured a vertebrae slightly and missed all of summer. Couldnt do much.
I was still conditioned to think winter was coming and it never came. Well they consider it winter, but it's January and im in shorts.


Anyway. Access to nature.. trails everywhere, close enough to SF.
Motorcycle heaven with all the roads and backroads.

Redwoods, mountains, ocean, foggy mornings, sunny days, etc etc.

Who is the idiot? Me? Was I the one saying illegals would build a public building when that isn‚Äôt remotely possible? Nope, that was you, racist.

Was I the one saying illegals with hate dripping from my lips? Nope, that was you again, racist.

Now I know why no one has ever head hunted you‚Ä¶your head is so empty it is invisible. Dictionaries aren‚Äôt read, racist one, they are referenced. 

Racism is precisely what you expressed by using the word illegals. Are the illegals you fear like the little pussy you are from America or another country? Hard to be illegal if you are American in the sense that you ignorantly used the word. Therefore, you absolutely meant someone from somewhere else. A different race. And you clearly didn‚Äôt like that. That‚Äôs racist. You are expressing racism in that kind of comment, racist.

You also revealed your ignorance. Racism and ignorance are always hand and hand. Only union workers will build that building, if it is ever built. But your ignorance of that and your over all stupidity, the actual mental retardation you have from being a Qanon fan, meant you couldn‚Äôt help your stupid self and made a racist remark. Now you want to try and say it was anything but racist. Well, fuck you, racist.

Again, if you don‚Äôt like being called a racist, the solution is a simple one. And you are such a simple fucking simpleton you might just be able to apply the solution. It clearly bothers you to be seen as a racist.

So, if you don‚Äôt want to be called a racist, ready, here it is, don‚Äôt be a racist, don‚Äôt say racist things.

"Glad they worked well for you, sorry it didn't work out! You have the right idea with open mics but try for things where it's actually likely that you'll say hi to a stranger who could become a friend. For example trivia night with teams is a thing where people are grouping up and interacting and more teammates is usually better, versus open mic where 90% of the attendees are quietly listening. Book clubs and boardgaming nights are another example of situations where you're naturally talking to others about things that interest you.

It's also worth suggesting that you branch out to try new things that *could* interest you. Many people get caught in the trap of assuming that because they're introverted computer nerds they necessarily need to get on the computer and find another introverted nerd... but then meeting up is super awkward and often hard. Do you like nature? Maybe volunteer to clean a beach. Do you like hands-on DIY? I'm biased but Chimera Arts is right there.

"Some things that helped me were to try and find things to learn with the intention of learning and enjoying myself first and then making connections after that. Sometimes people have this aura that they exude when trying to meet people that can feel a bit hard to connect with. I guess it could be called desperation but whatever it was I gave it off really hard when I tried too hard. but when I didn't make connecting with people as my main focus it helped me love my time with myself but also made me seem less eager to talk with people and people then became easier to talk to.   I took some cheese making and brewing classes from ""the beverage people"", Scottish Country dancing in Monroe Hall, and went to GameScape and Nostalgia Alley to learn new board and video games. The connections I made were small but a few turned into some cool chill people that I call up now and then and hang out with.

"If you're on the fence about getting a dog, get one (or if you already have one, yay). I've met tons of people on dog walks or at the dog park. Obviously, don't get a dog *just* to meet people but if you already have one or you *want* one, it's a great way to break down walls between people and strike up conversations and friendships. And of course, they are great companions when you're lonely too.

If you go that route, be sure you get a dog that's suited to your lifestyle. Get a huskie only if you like to hike 12 miles a day and have a big yard (with a really tall fence) for them to run around in. Don't get a pug if you *do* want to hike 12 miles a day.

"It can be easier to go out and just talk with people on non-‚Äúgoing out‚Äù nights like Friday and Saturday evening. If you go after work to grab a beer at the bar on a Tuesday evening/late afternoon, you can usually find someone to talk to, either a bartender or patron, since there won‚Äôt be as many partiers or drunks bringing the energy way up. I did this a lot when I was newly single and trying to re-learn how to talk with strangers. Do it consistently but cut yourself a break if you find it hard, you‚Äôre practicing and plus no one is that good at it yet, what with Covid and all. 

I also found it helped to bring a book to both keep yourself occupied, and it can be a conversation starter for someone else if they think what you‚Äôre reading looks interesting. Staring at your phone is a pretty universal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm occupied‚Äù signal but for some reason people at pubs feel generally a bit more inclined to say hi if you‚Äôre reading. Do it at the bar and not in a back corner though. 

As an aside, I found going and sitting and reading was a great way to learn to be still, when my heart was still broken from my breakup. So it served multiple purposes, and if my fishing expedition for conversation didn‚Äôt have any bites, I got to go be with myself, but be around others and not feel so alone. Obviously I don‚Äôt know you at all or what kind of person you are but these things helped me when my long relationship ended and I hope they help you.",t2_7qbmh,CaptainoftheVessel,0,1646948650.0,0,t1_i05sps9,i05sps9,True,No_Breakfast_4321,t3_tb5ilj,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/tb5ilj/update_my_wife_has_come_out_as_a_polyamorous/,Update: My wife has come out as a polyamorous lesbian,/r/santarosa/comments/tb5ilj/update_my_wife_has_come_out_as_a_polyamorous/i05sps9/,13,r/santarosa,0,13

"I worked for the Sutter Hospital building that you're referencing for about 3 years. I've been all over the old and new sections, basement, etc, including late at night when I was on call. I never had any paranormal experiences while I was there, but it's definitely got some creepy areas. I remember walking down the long first floor hallway by myself at 2am with all the lights off; completely silent, nobody around, just you and this seemingly infinite hallway stretching off into the darkness.

The basement hallway really creeped me out, looked like something from a movie. You had to crouch to walk through there, and there were these rusty pipes covered in cobwebs running the whole length of the hallway. They had these storage rooms where they held old hospital equipment, but in one it was a few old school baby cribs and walkers and stuff.

Ultimately the thing that scared me the most was the old administrative building (the one closest to chanate). That building is unreinforced masonry, and we were told it would definitely come down in the next quake. I'd always think about that when I was in there helping someone. That's ultimately why Sutter built the new hospital, because that old one is so dangerous.",t2_4gbyv,t4rdigrade,0,1646850516.0,0,t1_i00425o,i00425o,True,MassMystery707,t3_ta2vqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/ta2vqy/the_hospital_on_the_hill/,The Hospital On the Hill,/r/santarosa/comments/ta2vqy/the_hospital_on_the_hill/i00425o/,2,r/santarosa,0,2
