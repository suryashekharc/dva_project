You can narrow your search down by their area of expertise, types of treatment you'd prefer (behavioral, medicine, combination of both, etc.) and by insurance accepted.

"What I found from ada.gov
Are emotional support, therapy, comfort, or companion animals considered service animals under the ADA?
A. No.  These terms are used to describe animals that provide comfort just by being with a person.  Because they have not been trained to perform a specific job or task, they do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.  However, some State or local governments have laws that allow people to take emotional support animals into public places.  You may check with your State and local government agencies to find out about these laws.

"One thing I've learned about taxes is you should always ask 'lower taxes for who?'.   I always go to the [Who Pays report at ITEP](https://itep.org/whopays-map/)

According to that, your taxes in Texas will be higher than in VT if you are in the lower 40% of income.   If you're in higher income brackets your taxes will be less in Texas, sometimes substantially.

In Vermont if you are in the lowest 20% of income (less than $21K) your tax burden is effectively 8.7%.   In Texas, it's 13%.

On the other hand,  if you're in the top 1% in VT you're paying 10.4%.  In Texas it's only 3.1%  (note the top 1% income levels are at different spots, but the larger point stands).

This is certainly a step in the right direction, but...

5 cents when the redemption act was passed in 1972 would be 34 cents today. [Source.](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1972?amount=0.05)

This kind of stuff needs to be indexed to inflation. It pains me that it never is. How hard would it be to add a clause to the bill stating that the redemption values printed on cans shall increase each year (or every 5 years, or whatever) at the rate of inflation over the same time frame, rounded down (or up) to the nearest cent.

[VPR on mud season, from 2014](https://www.vpr.org/vpr-news/2014-04-23/a-dirty-little-secret-some-towns-are-beating-mud-season): 

> Not surprisingly, drainage is the key and the key to drainage is in the layers of gravel used below and on the surface of the road. 

> Coarser gravel underneath lets water drain through it ‚Äì and finer gravel on top helps shed water. 

> And it‚Äôs not just dug out of a pit or river bank.
> The gravel is processed using stone crushed to the right size and shape, mixed with sand and dirt in the right proportions, then applied correctly.  In some cases, a fabric is put down to keep the layers from mixing.

> These ideas aren‚Äôt new, but they‚Äôre slow to be adopted.
> ‚ÄúThe engineering has been there for a long, long time. The cultural change is another thing all together,‚Äù says David Antone, director of The Vermont Local Roads Program at Saint Michael‚Äôs College.

> Though it's common knowledge that building with clean, non-frost-susceptible material will help prevent
 thaw weakening, the practice is expensive,"" said Eaton.  
> ""The old anecdotes about the frugality of Vermonters tend to ring particularly true around town meeting day when the annual budget is set.

> Interviews with road commissioners indicate the capital cost of improvements is their primary constraint. Past solutions in many towns have required extensive processing of material from local deposits or hauling in more appropriate material over costly distances. The capital costs of these activities are often unpalatable to town officials and citizens, so town road crews use what is available in local gravel pits with minimal or no processing beyond extraction. 

> Commissioners can seldom obtain budget approval to include engineered materials, such as geosynthetics and soil additives, in their improvement plans.""

"> The influx of newcomers to Vermont recently is astounding, so we'll see how that affects roads!

Multiply VT population by 14x and corruption by about that much too and you'll get to finally get to experience the New Jersey roads that I drive on and love so dearly. I've started naming the potholes on my commute! Everyone here drives like a maniac, except the equal amount of people going 50mph in the left lane. I know it sounds bad, but there's never a boring drive around here, and you'll feel like a complete badass just for making it to your destination without suffering damage to your vehicle or your own body.

"Absolutely, that should get fixed too. How would you count that data? When it happened to me this past January, I spent a week making phone calls every day - average hold time 43 minutes, I tracked it - and making appeals to VT Legal Aid's Office of the Healthcare Advocate, until at last some customer service rep went into some byzantine system and ""fixed"" it.

Then it was wrong again two weeks later.

At no point did anyone do a customer survey; I think if I didn't yell about it frequently (because seriously, what the fuck), it wouldn't be visible anywhere.

What we can tally is transgender death rates; transgender suicide rates; and the rate at which transgender people in Vermont seek help for healthcare issues. VT Legal Aid's OHA has some numbers, which I think they publish every few years or so, but they're not the only ones; there's a number of nonprofits in health justice who do work in this field.

Here's a question for you -- how many Vermonter lives would this legislation need to save before it's worthwhile?

"I am not generalizing about the authoritarian, spiteful nature of the south. I said that's the collective will. You measure that by votes, i.e. politics. It's not a generalization to say the whole south currently has a majority of elected representatives that espouse and seek to enforce authoritarian rules about morality and behavior, and that they espouse and endorse views and people who are deeply spiteful in furtherance of that morality.

Calling them what they are, accurately, is not an insult. If you feel insulted by it, may I suggest it's because you sympathize?

I pointed out that the south is full of beautiful country and people first, then noted that it's, on the whole, not worth it because of the majority viewpoints and the way people take somewhere between very little and zero care for the idea of the commons, and have thus committed many tragedies. 

I also never said the north or the west (or anywhere else) are devoid of these conditions. But compared to Vermont, even at it's poorest or most desolate, the south is, with some exceptions, worse. 

In sum, you've misconstrued my argument to make a point rebutting nothing I actually said.

My family is from Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, and I lived in the south (Georgia and Arkansas, primarily) for nearly 20 years, and I know that's more mid-south than south, but I also spent my whole undergrad and graduate degrees traveling extensively throughout Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida in addition to New England,  the west, and the midwest.

"Southern New England  climate is shifting: See the link for Connecticut. Data from 1991-2020

In the past the climate was 'Dfa/Dfb climate- humid continental under the Koppen Climate system- Today southern New England is shifting to a 'Cfa' climate  known as 'humid subtropical/humid temperate.  Winters' in the region are  not nearly as cold as forty years ago- while summers are much warmer.

Reasons why we are the  fastest warming globally:  because of our proximity to the warming waters in the Atlantic Ocean. Also a change in both  ocean and atmospheric circulation- due to arctic sea ice loss in summer.

"To restate, this survey does not use birth certificate data, it is from the annual American Community Survey.

If you were surveyed, having been born in DHMC or similar but to a Vermont family and raised in Vermont, would you reply that you were originally from New Hampshire?

This has come up before when I posted the smaller factoid that less than 50% of current Vermont residents claim to be from Vermont originally. It was said that this was due to many Vermonters being born across the river and lowering the percentage. A deeper dive shows that this isn't the case based on the numbers and an understanding of the source data.

It's actually a fun set of data to explore. The population of current Vermont residents (born anywhere) is higher than all those indicating they are Vermont-born nationwide (including Vermont).

"I was hoping for some efficiency curves, not more marketing materials.  The fact of the matter is a heat pump relies on drawing the heat energy from outside into the home. When it's cold outside, there is less heat energy and the heat pump has to work harder, making it less and less efficient as it gets colder. That's just the unavoidable nature of the beast.  Most models start losing efficiency somewhere between 25 and 40 degrees, and then a complete fall out at their lowest temperature rating.  This means as you need the most heat, the system needs to work the hardest to get it.   Best practice (minimizing cost, maximizing effectiveness and efficiency) is to figure the breakeven point, in terms of outside temperature, for a supplemental heat source for cold weather. You calculate when running the heat pump alone will become more expensive than running the supplement and have the supplement kick on at the appropriate temperature.  No one needs to be paying huge surprise electric bills after a few weeks below 0, when they can optimize the efficiency of a heat pump and offset the areas where it's not efficient.  

A 10% efficiency increase from refrigerant is a nice improvement that will certainly shift the curves down to lower temperatures and decrease those break even points, I don't think 10% will eliminate the need for supplemental heat in cold climates all together though.
