Great place to live.  People are friendly and costs are lower than just about anywhere else in CA.  If you are civil service, you get LA pay rates.  Base works a compressed work schedule, so you get every other Friday off.

Housing is mostly newer, stores are good, but limited.  We made heavy use of Amazon prime and trips for shopping out of town.

Schools are surprisingly good.  Being an R&D place a lot of emphasis is placed on education and it shows.

It’s a small town. Has its upside and downside depending on your perspective. If you enjoy the outside and exploring the high desert you have found a great place. Only takes 10 minutes to get from one side of town to the other. Shopping and entertainment options can be limited. It has a very different economic makeup. Many folks make a very comfortable living and many are struggling to get by.

"It’s a great town.  We retired and left Ridgecrest-me being there 37 years and my wife her entire life- a year ago.  Still get back for work and family.   

Depending on what you are moving there for- work on the Base, etc., you will meet some amazing people.  Weather is not too bad- it does get pretty damn hot, and the wind can be kind of annoying, but the nice spring and fall and mild winters make up for the couple of months of blazing temps.  There is usually a brief period where a lot of monsoonal moisture comes up
from AZ, and if you just have swamp coolers, that can get a little miserable, but it’s brief.  

Close to just about anything you want to do- LA, San Diego, Vegas.  Mountains, camping, skiing, beaches- all within a few hours drive.  

The desert has its own beauty and depending on where you are coming from, it may take a little getting used to.  

Schools are great.  Cost of living not too bad compared to the rest of CA.  

About the biggest drawback is variety in shopping- definitely not a lot in town, but Lancaster/Palmdale or Bakersfield are close enough you can make a day of it.",t2_h8uiwf02,PairWarm8602,0,1647754218.0,0,t1_i1derhz,i1derhz,True,VMWare345,t3_tibcop,https://www.reddit.com/r/ridgecrest/comments/tibcop/ridgecrest_cali/,Ridgecrest Cali,/r/ridgecrest/comments/tibcop/ridgecrest_cali/i1derhz/,1,r/ridgecrest,0,1

"Ridgecrest Heights is where new homes are being built. There are new builds throughout the town, but the south eastern part has more lots where builders build. It's not the greatest area IMO. La Mirage area close to Leroy Jackson park isn't a desired spot to live. Homes between Downs and Mahan Streets in the North part seem to be pretty classy. Heritage is another area that is quaint and manicured with a communal pool and park and tennis courts. These houses typically have small yards and HOA fees. College Heights also has new builds, and this is stereotypically the ""rich area"" but I think it's ok. The closest thing to it is Walmart and Albertsons. It also depends on your target price for homes. You'll probably be looking around 350-500k in the college Heights area. Ridgecrest Heights you'll probably be closer to lower 300s for new builds. Houses will range in the 300-400 range in Heritage. 

Unfortunately, a lot of houses that go up for sale in Ridgecrest are fairly out dates. If you are cool with tile countertops, single pane windows, outdated bathrooms and kitchens that aren't open concept, then you can find those for purchasing probably in the 200k range.

Now I've said all this with buying a home. Renting locations will still be in the same mentioned areas, and rental prices will reflected in those areas. Expect to pay around 1300-2000k a month for a home. A condo or apartment, probably around 950-1300 per month. 


The town is getting more and more businesses and it's expanding. A Panda Express just opened and Chipotle is being constructed. You can google and get a vibe for all the box stores and restaurants. It's small enough you can get almost anywhere there in less than 10 minutes which is nice. If you like outdoor stuff, it's an awesome place to be.

The cat does absolutely run the store, the humans are it's employees. I cannot explain the bookstore's smell to you because they also sell incense so it smells like incense and old books and new books and it's very very welcoming.

"The escape room place is not open as far as I know. It's been under construction since before I moved here with no signs of opening.

The hobby shop, Just Imagine, is on China Lake Blvd across the street from Stater Bros. Great shop, if you're into Dungeons and Dragons and/or Magic the Gathering and/or comics, it's a good place to go, and there's a decent chance you run into other folx into those things there. The proprietor, whose name currently escapes me, is a very cool dude.

I've found there are quite a few clubs and organizations across town that quench my social needs, and since I enjoy a lot of solo hobbies, a trip to Joann and Red Rock Books keeps me entertained for months at a time. There's a garden club, a quilting guild, a roller derby group, a skate park, a swing and ballroom dance group, a Toastmasters club, an animal shelter to volunteer at(not sure if they still accept volunteers but they did before the pandemic), a historical costuming group, an archery club, a mountain rescue group, a farmers market, a dog park, a large shooting range that holds events, tennis courts, dirt biking groups, a music appreciation group(they had concerts before but I don't know if those have resumed since the pandemic), and a theater group(I'm not sure if it's a high school group or a community group, but you can ask about it at the bookstore). I've also seen slack lining folx at one of the parks, but I don't know if they're a club or not.

Ridgecrest is a Facebook town, so you'll find more events there. There's also the Ridgecrest Events page, but since the pandemic I haven't found it as useful.

The bars most likely close early because of the pandemic, but I remember nearly all of them used to close at 2am, so they might again in the future. The exception is Flight Line, but that's more of a spot to bring your dinner and have a beer.

I'm also extremely fond of the tea house, Marcela's Enchanted Cottage, if you like a bit of a prim and proper afternoon with a book or a friend and a pot of tea. 

Like Inigo said, if you prefer self-driven hobbies or the outdoors, you're going to find Ridgecrest very easy to live in. If you're looking for any sort of bustling scene, this is not the city for that. But the nice thing about Ridgecrest is that if you dig for it, there's a surprising amount of stuff going on.",t2_tpgwn,lilacslemonslilies,0,1630387976.0,0,t1_hb0vxah,hb0vxah,True,BigBoiUnderwear,t3_pexr6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ridgecrest/comments/pexr6f/what_do_you_do_for_fun_in_ridgecrest/,What do you do for fun in Ridgecrest?,/r/ridgecrest/comments/pexr6f/what_do_you_do_for_fun_in_ridgecrest/hb0vxah/,5,r/ridgecrest,0,5
"Ridgecrest is all about outdoorsy stuff.

Mountain biking.  Hiking.  Skiing (snow or water).  Hunting.  Shooting in general.  Sailing (land and water).  White water kayaking/rafting.  Rock climbing.  If it can be done outdoors, it's pretty close to Ridgecrest.  True, some activities involve longer drives than others.  Some can be done within minutes of your front door.  Others involve a couple hour drive.  Most are somewhere in between.

But what it really boils down to is if you're the kind of person who can entertain yourself (a hobby of one flavor or another) or if you require others to entertain you (night clubs, etc.).  If you've can entertain yourself, Ridgecrest is awesome.  If you require others to entertain you, I imagine Ridgecrest is the 3rd Ring of Hell.

Personally?  I'm into [Cowboy Action Shooting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXPB8I1FuF8).  Obviously not my video, but since most people don't have a clue what CAS is, the video gives 'em an idea.  There's a local club that does this.  It's small but active (2 shoots a month).

"Since AgathaM already covered the Inyokern/Inyo-Kern thing I'll give a few other comments.

Pretty much anywhere nearby that you would be able to have a little plot of land would be in Kern County, but outside the Ridgecrest city limits. Advantage, you get the space, disadvantage, you'll get basically all your services from the city of Ridgecrest but will not be able to vote for any city elections (City Council, water district, etc). I worked the elections in November 2020 and you'd be surprised at how many people thought they had received a defective ballot because they lived in the county (what we would call outside city limits) and their ballot did not have the city council choices on it. Your address may say Ridgecrest, CA 93555 but your home can be technically outside of city limits.

Will you be transferring your position to China Lake or is your job able to be done remotely? There aren't a lot of choices for internet service providers here, so if you will need high speed internet for work you'll want to make sure you live in an area that Mediacom services. There are a few other providers but none as fast as Mediacom.

"We are avid gardeners here and have put a lot of time and effort into growing and expanding our personal collection of wonderful plants, flowers and trees . Personally, we like a combination of hardy, yet beautiful, plants as well as fruit trees and colorful flowers. 

For trees, you can always go with **Palm Trees, Acacia and Eucalyptus.**

Great fruit trees include **Pomegranate, Apple, Pear and Fig**.

For flowers, we love **Lantana, Salvia, Cosmos and Geraniums**.

**Some other tips:**

* When buying new trees or flowers, always consider the hardiness zone. Ridgecrest is in the hardiness range of 8a, 8b, 9a and 9b. 
*  It is imperative to water accordingly, depending on the specific needs of the plant. Be careful not to overwater nor let them get too dry. 
*  Buy a reliable set of gardening tools. Here's a great affordable kit with everything you need to get started: [https://amzn.to/2SuB8ph](https://amzn.to/2SuB8ph)

"When it snows and the local roads ice up, which is rare, everybody stays home and they may close the base.

There are two ways to Bakersfield, 58 and Isabella.  58 is freeway roads, Isabella is senic. i would not recommend the scenic route for the first time after dark.

Being former military you will understand what it is like to get on base, wear ID, follow the base rules, etc.

"Ridgecrest is a love it or hate it kind of place.

If your idea of ""fun"" is outdoorsy and self-reliant (hiking, rock climbing, fishing, shooting, flying, sailing, biking, etc.)?  You'll love it.

If your idea of ""fun"" is indoorsy (is that a word?) and relies on others (concerts, theater, night clubs, etc.)?  You'll hate it.

Cost of living is reasonable.  Crime isn't bad.  Traffic is a dream compared to any metro area.  Weather is great 9 months out of the year (no denying that summer is hot!).

"I didn't grow up in Ridgecrest, but rather in nearby Searles Valley, and hardly a day goes by where I don't want to move back. I've been in Bakersfield for way too long now, and I want out.  


Part of it is the sights; I love the desert, especially the area around where I grew up. My sister and I would often go out into the wilds with our grandpa while he searched for water and rare metals via dowsing. While he did his thing, I would wander around and take in the sights, the sounds, the smells. I recall sitting on my front porch as a child and watching the thunderheads grow over the Slate Range, listening to the thunder roll across the valley, smelling the rain on the air. I would also go outside well after dark and simply look up; Trona has some of the best night skies that I have ever had the privilege of witnessing. You can look in just one small part of the sky forever and always find something new.  


I'm also in love with the idea of living in a small town; you get a sense of community that you don't feel when living in a city: Everyone knows everybody. Many of the lifelong friends I've made came from my years living in Trona. A few are still there; many left after graduating from high school but came back years later, some with families.

"A little outsiders view of Ridgecrest.  Well, not really an outsider, I have been in the area over 35 years, however, I did not grow up here, and I moved here as an adult because of my work.

And I could not get out of that town fast enough.  I graduated HS and was out to anyplace but there as quick as possible.  Since then I have been back home, a few times, and it is not as bad as I remember it.

I suspect that this ""get out as soon as I can"" thing is a common teen thing for middle sized / small towns.  As a young person such towns seem so dead, so barren.

In hindsight, RC has a lot of pluses that aren't particularly relevant to a teenager growing up.  At the same time, the major minuses of RC to a teenager (weather + lack of mass transit) aren't particularly relevant to a grown adult.  So while I will tell you that RC is a terrible place to grow up, I'll also say that it's a great place to raise kids.

|how bout hold your mouth and provide a good example... 

[Sigh] Ok, just a couple. 1st, There are several examples of her brainlessness in the recorded Ridgecrest council meetings go there for more. 2nd, We can start with how she thinks Covid is a hoax. That's a stupid, and dangerous belief (like believing hoards of antifa are spreading wildfires). Even if people are cool with losing 4% of the population for herd immunity, no-one knows the long term effects of the virus on other vital organs (except we are learning it's not negligible).

3rd. In denying people the right to buy marijuana, medicinal or recreational, she says she won't allow Ridgecrest to make money off of vice... but she's ok with TTT's? The beer cave? Drive thru cigarettes and liquor?! The fuck... She's afraid kids will all turn into couch puddles because ""weedos"" made a kid paralyzed once, for like an hour.

Covid does suck, but you can put your faith in NGO's and other international organizations not related to our politics if you really feel like noone is trustworthy on our country (we are not the center of the world). You can also cross reference facts between news sources, or countries for that matter, to get away from following the false dichotomy.

Racial tension has been high for a while. A lot of people are still triggered that a black man wrote a few laws while he was president. A lot of communities are tired of being ignored for being poor, or being minority. This talking point is real.

"Until the pandemic, a great place to meet people was going to events like the Desert County Fair, Star Party, and the like, most of the scheduling of which could be found on ridgecrestevents.com. That site also had the regular meetings of many of the local clubs(we have Toastmasters, Ballroom Dancing, Swing Music, etc.) and random events that would be held in town. 


During pandemic, uhhhh.... You might have to get really lucky in finding online communities based here and hoping you can meet in person when this all ends. I'm certain there are gaming and ttrpg type local groups that have successfully moved online, but finding them may be a challenge since they all started in person.


The local population(RC and the towns within a 50 mile radius) is quite active on Facebook. If you get into one local marketplace type group on FB, it should start recommending the online groups that exist locally. There's also an active population on Nextdoor, although that's more of a large neighborhood watch than somewhere to make pals. Still worth plugging in to.

"Alright dude so you're saying that for $70, you would rather have 5 mb/s rather than 60 mb/s? Mediacom would give you  400 gb a month for that package too, maybe not enough for a family, but for 1-2 people watching Netflix that is already miles better. Try streaming 4k on a 5 mb/s connection and see how that works out. That 5 mb/s would also be for the whole house, not just one device, so imagine splitting that across multiple devices without lag or buffering or pages taking a long time to load. Now let's see both their highest plans. We are talking $160 for 25 mb/s download on SBCs highest plan. That's worse than Mediacoms worst plan. Mediacom gives you up to 1 Gb/s for that and 6000 GB a month. If you choose to spend that much money on SBC, you have to be braindead.

"Hi I’m a pretentious person who moved to the bay area too!

I just wanted to add to the people at the bars that it’s everybody who is mean to everyone else in high school who peaked senior year.  They somehow were seen as amazingly brave for getting pregnant as teens because they were popular and received exceptionalism because their parents were business owners or clerks at the school. 
They all get drunk at the bar and fuck and fight .
Absolutely incestuous clique. 
(it’s even worse when half of them show up to your sisters wedding because they were friends with your sister but bullied the shit out of you)

Anyone who was exceptionally smart or made for bigger and better things, they only are remembered by who they were in high school. it doesn’t matter how well you did as an adult if you weren’t popular in school according to ridgecrest. 
Everybody who was popular who went off to college right afterwards came back because they realized that no one could stand them outside of home or that they weren’t applauded the same way they were back home. 
They end up at the bars too.

I lived in Ridgecrest for 6 months working on base, and researched heavily into the available ISPs there...they were literally all terrible, except for SBC. Everyone either had stupid data caps, were expensive and notorious for being unreliable (mediacom), or had unacceptably slow speeds combined with shitty data caps (viasat, Frontier). I tried Viasat before discovering SBC, Viasat was an awful waste of money. Frankly the shitty ISP choices in Ridgecrest are just criminal. SBC was a bit more expensive than the other choices, but they gave me a solid (and promised) speed, and it never went down once while we had it.

"The city tap water is above the national average in taste and quality.  With that said, it is still a chlorinated, batch processed, public water system.  The well water, depending on which wells are being mixed into the batch at the time, are some of the best in the nation, and the city water starts from the same sources as private wells.

&#x200B;

I have had MUCH worse city water, and I have had some, but not a lot, better.  Fortunately, I am on a private well now, and it is fantastic.

&#x200B;

The city is 90 minutes from the closest mall, CostCo, or Best Buy.  Road tripping is a fact of life for some things that other locations take for a 10 minute trip run.  But there are like 5 Starbucks in town...

&#x200B;

The city itself is ""small town"" feeling.  And it has small town issues.  But it is not really a small town anymore.  Because of its location it also has blooming large town issues, it is just close enough to some big cities for the issues to spill over a little.  Violent, random, crime is almost unheard of here.  Petty crime, drug on drug crime, and crimes generated by boredom are common, but not any more so than other cities of similar size.  There is a slightly greater Meth problem here, so many of the crimes are based on people steeling stuff to support that habit.

&#x200B;

Someone else said it, and I will repeat it, there is no street in town I would be concerned about walk at midnight.  There are, of course, neighborhoods I would not want my kids to be in at night, but that is just parenting.  And there are streets I would not park my car on unlocked.  There are ""good"" and ""bad"" parts of town, but the bad parts ain't all that bad and tend to be small and easily defined.

&#x200B;

In 30+ years at the current house (a bit outside of town) I have had my cars rifled once, 20 years ago.  All 5 cars parked in the front of the house were unlocked (who locked doors here at that time?).  During the night, someone went through them taking the change out of the ash trays and grabbing anything loose.  The thieves were in custody less than 12 hours later, and we got everything but the change back.

&#x200B;

Someone commented on the police.  The police are a small town agency dealing with big town problems that can drive in occasionally.  They are starting to be slightly overwhelmed with the increasing calls for service for more diverse issues.  They know more or less everyone, and they know who the people are they have to deal with most often.  Right or wrong, if you make it on that side of the list they can be pretty dogged.  They spend 99% of their time dealing with 3% of the population, and they can be quite enthusiastic about the ones they interface with often.  In 30+ years in this town all of my police interactions have been positive, even when the ticket, or whatever, was my fault.  However, I know people who have had not so positive interactions with the local agencies.  What should be minor domestic violence situations can be an issue.  Even a simple verbal between partners can end up with a domestic violence case being initiated by the police.

&#x200B;

The heat.  Yes, if you can't take heat, this might not be the place for you.  It is not unheard of to have a couple weeks with every day in the 110+ area, peaking around 113 - 115, and 40+ days in a row of over 100 deg F.  On the other hand, it is almost never butt numbing cold in the winter.  It can get down to single digits at night, however that is very uncommon.  A day where the daytime high is not above freezing is unusual, even in hard winter.

&#x200B;

Swamp coolers do work, if they are well maintained.  The other day it was 108 F outside, and the temp inside the house here peaked at 76 deg F in the warmest room.  In August, when it is more humid and 105+, it can reach up to 80 deg F in the house.  I have only had it over 80 deg F in the house a few times unless there was something wrong with the cooler.  We also have refrigerated air, in addition to swamp cooling, and we end up running it 2 to 4 weeks out of the year.

&#x200B;

Wind, this place does have some serious wind issues.  Depending on where you are located around town you can have 10 minute averages of over 40 MPH easily, with gusts in the 60+ range.  I have seen the wind speed indicator not drop below 30 MPH for 24 hours or more.

&#x200B;

Entertainment.  There is not much in the way of structure entertainment in town.  If you are a self starter in this area then you might be OK, if you rely on external stuff, concerts, fairs, clubs, things like that, then it might be a bit of a drag.  For outdoors stuff, hiking, 4 wheeling, dirt biking, shooting, etc, it is an awesome area.  There are vast tracks of remote areas to explore, and Death Valley is only about an hour and some change away.People from LA come up here for those things, and the desert around town can sprout cities of RVs on a Friday night before a long weekend.  Mountains with snow (seasonal, of course), rivers, lakes, even the ocean, are not beyond day trips from here, but they are all a road trip away.

&#x200B;

The towns economy is driven by the base.  By far the largest employer, even if you are not directly employed by the base you probably work to support the community so that the base can exist.  If the base went away or closed it is almost certain the town would collapse in short time.  Fortunately, the base makes up about 40% of all the US Navy's land holding world wide, and while base business may ebb and flow the Navy would not be willing to shut the base down except under the most dire fiscal setting.  If the US Navy is still putting warships to sea this base will probably remain open in some capacity to support the warfighter.  Of course, in lean times the base work population does reduce significantly.

&#x200B;

I was raised in green country, coming to this high desert was a bit of a shock.  So much...nothing.  But now when I go back to green country I feel a bit claustrophobic.  Here I can set on the back porch and watch a lightning storm march towards me from miles and miles away, watch it approach for an hour or more.  The horizon is far away.  From the front porch I can see Mt Whitney, from the back porch I can see the mountains that ring Death Valley.  From my yard I can see things that are 70+ miles away.  You get used to it, and it can be quite enchanting.  But some people never like it.  It depends on you.

&#x200B;

The following picture is right out of the camera, the only processing applied is resizing down to 1200 pixels wide, no saturation boost, no levels changes, no contrast changes.  These are the mountains to the west of town.  The tallest peak there is Owens, at a tad over 8400 feet.

"It's insular and white. I lived there for 20+ years and always knew that it was kind of a shitty place, but never realized *how* shitty. After moving to the Bay Area for school, all of my effort has been put into never returning (except for holidays to see family). Most people I knew in highschool made it their #1 goal to get the fuck out. The people who didn't are stuck at dead-end jobs or were roped into the downward spiral of teenage pregnancy because Kern County (being the most conservative county in California) does not give a fuck about sexual education or any kind of education for that matter. 

I don't want to paint a completely dismal picture of the place, only because I think the natural beauty is some of the greatest that California has to offer. Unfortunately, the people are another story. There's very little racial diversity or diversity of thought. The bars are frequently populated by alcoholic, white trash losers whose only goal for the night is to get into a fight. Racism is at times pretty explicit. Finding intellectual outlets is difficult if not impossible. Maybe I'm pretentious, maybe I just hate the overwhelming feeling of isolation and inevitable depression that sets in when I spend too much time there.

"I lived there for 5 years. Worked on base, had a job I loved and made some great friends. There are a lot of young professionals there that moved for the job. There's plenty of out door activities, which I loved. Any time but the summer is pretty nice, weather wise. Cost of living is super cheap, especially compared to the rest of Cali. And if you are a gov employee you get the LA cost of living bump which is pretty amazing. It's super quite at night, relatively safe (the meth scene is fairly big there so you'll see tweekers around).

That's where the pro's end for me though. I grew to hate the heat. 110-115 in the summer is just plain awful. Yes, it is a dry heat, but who cares when your eyeballs shrivel every time you step outside. You better hope you have a good paying job cuz to use AC in the summer, which you will have to, can cost upwards of $500 a month in electricty (because California sucks that way). A lot of places have swamp coolers, which sort of help. They will bring in down from 150 inside to a semi bearable 90 (maybe a little cooler depending on how good your swamp is). 

In town, social life is the pits. There's a few bars, all frequented by the local trash. If you're anything but conservative don't even bother getting into political conversations, no one there wants to hear your non Fox news rhetoric. The restaurants are all generic bleh's. This is the sort of town there gets excited when new fast food opens. No one there cares about good food. 

I would absolutely no want to raise children there. the school system is ok, but there's very little for kids to do. Drug use, partying, teenage pregnancy, is all very common with highschoolers in Ridgecrest (a friend of my used to work for the baby doc in town, so I have first hand information). 

I could go on. After 5 years that town had shriveled my soul.  I had to get out. I get back once in a while to visit friends, and think that maybe I was being to harsh, that it wasn't so bad. But then the heat returns, or we try and plan going out for dinner and drinks, or just try to come up with anything to do in town on a saturday and I remember that no, it sucks ass there. 

If the job you are looking at is something you think you will really enjoy, do like I did and give it 3-5 years. Build you experience, then look into moving on. But who knows, you may end up liking it. I've know plenty of people that have been sucked in my the cost of living and the high pay and just accepted the Crust and their new home.

"You will either love or hate Ridgecrest and much of that depends on your definition of fun.

If your idea of fun is getting out and doing outdoorsy stuff?  You'll do just fine.  Hunting.  Fishing.  Hiking.  Rock climbing.  Skiing (water and snow).  Hang gliding.  Prospecting.  Geocaching.  Mountain biking.  Motocross riding.  If it's outdoors and people do it, odds are it can be done on a weekend here.

If, on the other hand, your idea of fun is going to a nightclub or catching a concert or similar urban activities (ie, activities that require a metro area to support), then you're gonna think that Ridgecrest is the third ring of Hell.

As for demographics... It's very white and very Republican.  No denying that.  But being in California tempers that.

Not as much military as you'd think though.  The military is around to maintain/fly the planes and provide EOD support but otherwise the base is almost exclusively run by civilians.  Seriously, I can go months without seeing a person in uniform or obvious military haircut.

The economy is mostly tied to the defense budget.  The national economy can go up and down and Ridgecrest (for the most part) doesn't care.  But when the defense budget goes up and down?  Yeah, that helps/hurts Ridgecrest.

Crime?  It's not the sleepy little town that it once was, but there isn't a street in town that I wouldn't walk down at midnight.  Other than gun stores (legal requirement) I'd be hard pressed to think of any home/business that has bars on the windows/doors.  I think we average like a murder every few years (but someone may chime in with better data). 

The tap water sucks (but is much better than it used to be).  The air quality is usually pretty good.  Summers suck (I don't care that it's a dry heat, it's hot!), but the winters make up for it.

"Evaporative coolers aren't too bad here.  There will be 2-3 weeks a year where it sucks, however.  Put it this way:  Evaporative cooling will knock about 30 degrees off ambient.  If it's 110  out, that means your house is at 80 degrees.  Livable, but not pleasant.

What I've done in the past is buy a window AC unit and put it in one room of the house.  During those 2-3 weeks, I got into the ""lifeboat"" and life was fine.

You'll notice that I used past tense, however.  Two summers ago I converted the house to AC.  Interesting thing.  Water has gotten more expensive (understandable) and AC units have gotten more efficient.  Long story short?  Once I stopped using the evaporative cooler my water bill dropped in a big way.  Did my electric bill go up?  Yes, but not grossly.  Long story short:  AC costs me about $20/month more than evaporative and the house is much more comfortable throughout the hot months.

"$750-800 for La Mirage and/or Desert Oasis, cheapest you'll find in Ridgecrest, but it's kindof a rough area, and even the newly renovated units are very cheaply done and still have problems. But they are livable, and it's safe enough as long as you lock your car and doors. Creeps will occasionally knock on your door at night to see if someone's home (they do this everywhere in Ridgecrest), as well as other pests. If you want to stop it, put a fake (or real if you want it) security camera on your porch, and a ""no soliciting"" sign by your door.

As for your internet service, a little known secret for Ridgecrest is SBC Wireless. Look them up. Bit more expensive, but fast speeds, no data cap, and very reliable. They are the ONLY good option. Do not even attempt to use Mediacom or Frontier or Viasat, they are notorious, their service is horrible in Ridgecrest.

Wherever you end up, try to get a place with a swamp cooler instead of a regular A/C unit, a swamp cooler can save you over $200 a month in electric bill. Power bills in Ridgecrest are insane.

Trash collection in Ridgecrest is around $65 a month. If you want to save that money, don't bother with Waste Management service, and just drive your trash to the landfill for free every week or two.

"$400/month?  Even for a place like Ridgecrest that is CHEAP.  I doubt you'll find that cheap without a room mate.

However.... Thinking outside the box a bit.... 

If you're willing to commute 30ish minutes, you might look at Trona.  I mean, where else will $25k BUY a house?  I don't know what rent is over there, but it's gotta be cheap, and I've known more than one person who said, ""I can buy a lot of gas for my car with the money I save on housing by living there.""

I've only lived here since late April though so my experience has been lots of heat and high winds, but apparently it can snow in the winter, just don't expect it to stick. Cell phone quality is garbage in certain areas even though we live in a bowl. The nearest Costco is over an hour and a half away. No fine cuisine here, just lots of mexican and asian foods and they are all ok for the area. Oddly the mexican food varies from really good some days to worse than taco bell so it's hit or miss on who's cooking that day.

Aside from all that, I picked up star gazing cause we live near Death Valley which is the mecca of zero light polution in the U.S. Even on moonless nights in town, you should be able to see the milky way. I would go down any of the highways late at night to get a real good view of it though. And take long exposure photos for the best photos.

Ridgecrest doesn't have any UNSAFE areas in the sense that I would fear walking down the street at midnight or whatever.  Are some areas better than others?  Of course, but it isn't like a major metro area where some neighborhoods are borderline war zones.

The two neighborhoods I would avoid: 1 - whatever they're calling the [one around N. Gold Canyon](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.628201,-117.6627146,17z).  2 - The area known to old school locals as [Rocket Town](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.617553,-117.6762443,18.42z).  These are the oldest two neighborhoods in Ridgecrest and they look it.  Crime will be higher (relative term; again - there are no neighborhoods worthy of out and out fear) and general building condition will be worse.

I'm not aware of any systemic slumlord issues in Ridgecrest but maybe I'm just oblivious due to owning rather than renting.  I'm sure there are a few but it's not like you can just say This Neighborhood or That Neighborhood are slumlord zones.

"Echoeing Mediacom. 

Pro-tip: When you sign up for PG&E (hopefully you have some gas usage in your house requiring service) they will route your call to a home service center where you can get reduced rates. DO THIS. They will try to sell you cable and other shit, which is fine cause it's at reduced rates as well...just don't feel pressured. Anywho....

Im paying 42.74 out the door per month for the Internet 100 plan. It normally runs 59.99 + monthly modem fee (11.50 per/m), taxes, etc...which would easily top $75-$80. I also got them to cut the installation cost from $99 to $49. My out the door first bill was $109 and some change.

Get your own seperate modem and router. I had my own modem (Netgear CM1000) and router (Netgear Nighthawk Model #R6900). They work excellent amd you'll have way more than you'll need, but it was worth it, IMO. You will call Mediacom with your modem and router info and they will walk you thru it, should you need help.


Via Medicom website:
Download speeds up to 100 Mbps†

Upload speeds up to 10 Mbps†

1000GB monthly usage allowance‡

Last but not least, pray to god you don't have a contractor come and install it. They are absolutely horrible, they used an old cable which subsequently squashed my internet after having it only 1 week. Plus, he spliced it (reasons unknown) which garbled the incoming signal. Took 3 hours over the phone for them to tell me they were gonna send out an actual mediacom tech.


Fast forward 4 days....


When the actual Mediacom tech arrived, he blatantly stated that the contractors often cut corners. Remember that old cable I spoke of? My installation cost pays for new gear and cables. The contractors will use an old cable and boxes to save them the cost of using new gear...even *though it's already been paid for* by me.

I came back to a house that had the breaker still turned off from when i left, house sitting at 90° on the thermostat (which didn't work initially until i called a repair guy to turn it back on, and he claimed it was working when they came by to fix the gas leak), and all the food in the fridge you can imagine what the smelled like, especially with the milk jug that exploded.

    I seen 2 Chinook's fly over today in formation. how much cargo would they need for a damaged jet?they usually have to maintain them very well..all together I seen at least 6 choppers fly over.
    3 of them were diff types 2 I can name was a Chinook and the other was a black tactical chopper forgot the name of them.I took pics of a few that I could didnt focus to well..as to the coso mountains I'm not talking about the hot springs. but the coso region its an active geothermal that's been having a lot of seismic activity as of late.
   I keep up with it on the caseismology YouTube channel its live 24/7 check it out might like it.anyways the coso volcanic feild is directly located in the inyokern county.as a matter of fact we are directly located in line of site of lava flow wasn't sure you knew that or not?have you ever heard of a guy named dutchsesnes on YouTube?he talks about the same thing as were talking about right now you should really check him out it'll inform ya as to what is actually happening.",t2_3ozwqlro,thejuice_123,0,1565236414.0,0,t1_ewa4h53,ewa4h53,False,thejuice_123,t3_cmzyhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ridgecrest/comments/cmzyhz/anyone_else_been_seeing_these_chinooks_flying_low/,Anyone else been seeing these Chinook's flying low in the area?,/r/ridgecrest/comments/cmzyhz/anyone_else_been_seeing_these_chinooks_flying_low/ewa4h53/,0,r/ridgecrest,0,0
"4chan isn’t going to be a bastion for truth. 

Cargo planes come and go. They bring things to the flight line. There are damaged buildings at the air field and it’s entirely possible that they were delivering equipment to do maintenance on the jets that may have been damaged in the quake. 

Plus, pilots fly over our air space for training. 

The coso hot springs aren’t going to cause quakes. However, geothermal active areas are prone to quakes. It is an opening for lava to come closer to the surface which means a split in the crust of the earth. The whole area is volcanically active. Mammoth Mountain continues to out gas poisonous gasses because of it.

"Only two and not much was taken. They have their loss on video per the police chief. 

Insurance fraud is already set in their rates so odds are you won’t see anything change because of it. Business insurance is different from homeowners. Lots of homeowner claims will drive up policies.

 With earthquakes, a lot of stuff isn’t covered if you don’t have an earthquake policy. Even then, the deductible is something like $10K or 10% so people aren’t going to make a claim unless catastrophic. Fires caused by the earthquake are covered by homeowners I believe.

CLOTA, murder mystery interactive shows, RMES, Desert Community Orchestra, Community  Band, Big Band X-Press, all the local bands that perform in the spring summer at local venues. At least two locations in town have Open Mic nights. 

If you’re into nerdy stuff, there is a community that does table top gaming (think D&D, Magic the Gathering, that sort of thing). 

If you’re into running, there are several running groups (OTHTC, Moms run this town). 

There is local adult softball, soccer, and on base leagues throughout the year (flag football, kickball, basketball I think, softball). 

Local bowling leagues. Toastmasters. Various philanthropy groups and social clubs. Lots of volunteer opportunities. 

There are also craft groups and quilt guilds. There is a dog agility club. 

Shooting competitions (several types). Horse riding (including endurance riding). Off road biking, dirt biking, off road vehicle recreation. Hiking, camping, white water rafting, fishing, and soon to be water skiing (lake is refilling post dam repair). Even volunteer search and rescue.

"> Flying out of here requires airport parking pretty much no matter what.

ProTip:  Fly out of Vegas and leave your car at one of the casinos.  My personal practice....

1 - Drive to Vegas night before flight.

2 - Enjoy an evening in Vegas.

3 - Take a morning flight after having a full night's rest (none of this ""drive to the airport at O' God Hundred shit!).

4 - On your return, pick up the car at the casino and life is good.

Advantage.  A nice night in Vegas.  Traveling on a good night's sleep.  And oh, a night in a Vegas casino is cheaper than a week's worth of airport parking.

"Ridgecrest is the kind of city where you have to dig deep to get to the best parts but they're worth it. Amazon and Walmart are king here, there's also a few smaller chain stores(Big Lots, Big 5, Marshall's, etc) and three non-Walmart grocery stores.

I would recommend looking through The Swap Sheet to get an idea of the local businesses, they also have a restaurant guide. You will hear mixed reviews about every restaurant here except the French place, but living here you find your favorites pretty quickly. Nightlife is rather lacking, but it's still nice to go to the bar with some friends and hang out.

Inyokern boasts that it's 100 miles from everywhere, and Ridgecrest is 12 miles from that so take that as your metric for traveling to any larger 100k plus populated cities. Within 50 miles is Lake Isabella and Mojave. Mojave is a good place to stop to pee on your way to somewhere bigger and Lake Isabella has a lake, or so I've heard. Further south is Lancaster/Palmdale and ""north"" is Bakersfield. You're about three hours from LA and Disneyland and four hours from Vegas, so weekend road trips are super doable. Further out I haven't gone. Flying out of here requires airport parking pretty much no matter what.

You get most bang for your buck if you're into outdoorsy stuff, but there's still non-outdoorsy communities here. It has a very small town environment - about a third of the town is on base and everyone else knows people on base, so you kinda end up knowing everyone after a while. This is a bit of a mixed bag depending, but overall Ridgecrest is a nice place to live.

If you go to the outskirts of town, where there are still suburbs but you start seeing more empty lots everywhere, you can see the stars at night and it's wonderful.

"I grew up here and recently had to come back to stay and help parents. There's ... Walmart. For food, maybe Olvera's, Lugo's, Bernadino's (Inyokern) and Classic Burgers (also Inyokern). Not really close to much. You can drive to Death Valley and up North to some park areas. If you want to go to a real mall, you'll need to drive about 100+ miles to Bakersfield or Antelope Valley and if you want a bigger venue then it's all the way to L.A. or Vegas.

If you like desert hiking, etc., then there is plenty.

"Heh... If you're coming from the East Coast there is going to be some serious culture shock.  OK, that said I'll address your post line by line(ish).

> I’m just looking to hear what everyone thinks about it, what the good spots are in town, some of the drawbacks, and what you do on the weekends and what kind of traveling you get done.

I love it here, but when you ask about the ""good spots in town"" you're making me laugh.  This is the culture shock.  Good spots in town?  Yeah, not really any such thing.  Ridgerest is a great place to live if you're into outdoorsy stuff.  Hunting.  Fishing.  Hiking.  Rock climbing.  Skiing.  Sailing.  Dirt bikes.  Mountain bikes.  Shooting.  If its outdoorsy, it is probably close enough to enjoy.  But if your idea of entertainment is going to a local night club and dancing the night away?  Yeah, you're gonna hate Ridgecrest.  The nightlife is limited at best.

Drawbacks?  As far as I'm concerned the only drawback is the weather.

Weekends?  Hunting.  Camping.  Shooting.  Vegas.

> Is it easy to get into all the National Parks along 395?

Yes.

> What’s the nearest place you go to if you need some bigger city stuff?

Amazon.com?  I'm not sure what you mean by ""big city stuff"" unless you're talking about concerts and such.  In which case the answer is the greater Los Angeles area (although I personally prefer Vegas).

> How’s it compare to the place you might have lived before?

Not the best, but far from the worst.  For calibration, however, let it be known that the worst place I've ever lived (opinion, obviously) is San Diego while the best place I've ever lived is Albuquerque.

"Dude - bitter much?

If you’re into music, there are plenty of opportunities to perform or listen. Open mic night at the USO, concerts at the museum and the PAC, desert community orchestra. 

Outdoor activities - mens and coed softball, soccer, mountain biking, running (check out OTHTC), horseback riding, dirt biking, petroglyph tours. 

Volunteer opportunities - hospital, food kitchens, library, women’s shelter, just to name a few. 

Is acting your thing?  RMES and CLOTA have all sorts of opportunities to audition for the show that will make you feel like a star.  

If you can’t get a job, go to cerro coso and work on your associate degree. Take temporary jobs from sass and toss. Frequently those turn into full time jobs.

"**SBC Wireless is the way to go.**

I had Mediacom at home for a while but it was constantly down. I've also worked at 2 separate businesses that had Verizon/Frontier and they were glitchy as well. Both businesses switched to SBC Wireless and have been better off since. 

**What's great about them is how simple everything is:**

1. Their packages are tiered.

2. Prices are fixed.

3. Equipment is INCLUDED in that package/price.

4. NO minimum and cancel at any time.

5. Upgrade/Downgrade any time and they will simply prorate the difference for that billing cycle.

6. I've only experienced one down time with them and it was because some fool cut the cable out in L.A. along with their secondary cable. They had everything up and running again within a few days and obtained back-up cable from a totally different direction to as an added precaution. 

7. You don't have to navigate a ridiculous automated system for customer service. 

8. They have an outstanding, over-the-top rep named Skip that has fantastic customer service skills and a flawless and unwavering perfectly pleasant demeanor. He handles all calls and is personally knowledgeable about all aspects of the business. If you ever have to leave a voice-message, he will return your call within a timely manner ever single time.

"If you're into outdoorsy stuff, Ridgecrest is a pretty nice place to be.  I don't care what it is that you like to do, if it's outdoorsy, it can be done within a 2 hour drive from here.  Hunting.  Fishing.  Camping.  Kayaking.  Hiking.  Skiing (water or snow).  Climbing.  Sailing (land or water).  And yes, even BMX.

If your idea of fun is ""clubbing"" and the like... Yeah, I imagine Ridgecrest is the 3rd ring of Hell for you.

That said, point by point....

* Schools:  Some of the schools are a bit rundown and they don't have a lot of the fancy facilities that you see in large city affluent school districts, but they're functional and I've never heard a complaint about the staff or quality of education.  Not to say that every teacher is loved by everyone (can't make everyone happy all the time, blah blah blah), but to say that even when you hear such talk it's about *a* teacher or *a* policy; not about the entire school/district/etc.

* Heat:  Yeah, it gets hot in the summer but the winters make up for it.  Basically, where people from (say) New England love the summer but hate the winter we're the exact opposite.  In either case you get 9 months of good weather, it's just that the bad weather is offset 6 months from what you're used to.

* Shoddy parts of town:  Name me a city that *doesn't* have ""shoddy parts of town.""  That said, by urban standards even the shoddy parts of town aren't that bad.  I've lived in urban areas where gunshots were something you heard regularly.  By contrast, there isn't a neighborhood that I wouldn't walk through alone at night (and I'm not exactly a physical specimen).

* Raising a family here:  It's an *excellent* place to raise a family.

* Isolation:  Hard to say.  It drives some folks nuts while it doesn't phase others.  My personal opinion is that it depends on whether you can entertain yourself or need someone else to entertain you.  People who have a hobby and enjoy said hobby do great here.  People who require something like a concert or similar that requires someone else to organize...not so much.
