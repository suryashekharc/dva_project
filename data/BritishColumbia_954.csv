"I have one car.  I drive long distances regularly.

It makes a METRIC BUTT TON of sense to go full EV.  You'll save so much money and you'll help reduce the climate extremes.

Will you need to stop for lunch? yep.  Does a forced 20minute stop matter on a 8hr drive? Nope.

$52k × 1.12 - $8k = $50k after tax for Ioniq5 long range (nothing to do with motor size, not sure where you got that)

$32k × 1.12 = $36k after tax for an Elantra with similar safety features and way less interior space.  It's $14k more for an EV upfront, but if you're driving 20,000km/yr you'll be money ahead in 4.5 years of driving.  We should be comparing a Tuscon to an Ioniq5 or a Leaf to an Elantra but even an Ioniq5 to an Elantra, the numbers make fiscal sense to upgrade to an EV in a >4.5year ownership period.

I blame everyone who follows a protest that has terrible messaging, even if they say well I only support 10% of the message. If you only agree with 10% of the messaging, find a different way to highlight the message you support.

As for funding of large spur of the moment and poorly organized movements, I think it's risky no matter the message. Hard to ensure where your dollars are going.

This is a direct knee jerk solution to, ""There are families who will be choosing between food and gas because the price of gas means they can't have both."" 

And remember that the criticism is that as the price of gas goes up, the actual tax per litre goes up with the price. So even if I accept your premise that the tax on fuel is meant to discourage fuel consumption, I feel like I need to remind you that the tax per litre when gas was 1.75 was about 50 cents and when it tipped 2.10 per litre there was nearly an extra 15 cents per litre in tax.

Unfortunately housing prices seem to be rising across Canada and even the US, UK, Australia, NZ and some other developed countries, so there is little likelihood that the BC NDP will solve it solo, *but*… they can help.

"I've got a different energy hub, figured it would be fun to monitor before/after my heat pump and EV charger installs.

https://bchydromarket.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/hydrohome-energy-bridge

This feeds into the (Powerley) HydroHome app, and even in a large house full of kids who leave lights on constantly, it's 99% novelty value. Quickly learned that - shocker - the car charger and dryer use a ton of power, and the heat pump cycles uses lots when it's cold/hot and otherwise its up and down cycles mostly obscure anything else you might care about. Realistically, you do learn the rest scarcely matters.

All the recommendations, bill estimates, and somehow even outside temperature tracking are garbage.

They ask for an extensive profile of your home which you'd think would factor in, but I helpfully get told that my electric heat pump + EV house is using way more power than everyone else, nevermind a comparison against vaguely similar homes.

Re: weather - they offer nice temperature vs energy charts, along with instantaneous data. And it knows where I am and currently says it's -1. It's 13. I promise you it wasn't -4 at 9am either. It's never the least bit accurate except perhaps by luck.

At the same time, I never did expect more than novelty value - I'm just surprised how incredibly bad the app is at the things it tries to do.

Maybe the rainforest hubs feed the data into a better service?

As is, I open the app for a few seconds a few days a week and occasionally admire the laundry/car spikes and the weird heat pump patterns during the day in this shoulder period...

"While I agree with you about density and walkability of neighborhoods needing to become a much larger priority, these things take time. I work building these communities and neighborhoods, and even moved to an area where I can walk to get all my necessities. However, I need to commute to work at hours and to locations that are unfeasible by bike or even transit to build these places, and my company can't just pick locations that are easily comutable for everyone as we all live in different areas due to the housing market. This is unlikely to change any time soon either. This leads us to needing to drive in most cases. While walkable neighborhoods would reduce everyone's need to drive  we can't eliminate the need until we address our housing costs, transit infrastructure, and offer credits to upgrade buildings power capacity to add power for EV, and have EV be cheaper and actually available in many cases for those who do need to drive.

"Hmm, that's what I mean, I paid $14k for the whole system, where it sounds like you're only getting the outdoor unit (plus all the fixins to make it work together).  Granted, that is the more expensive part of the system... but I'd get more quotes.  

When I did mine (beginning of last summer), got three quotes.  Had one lower (but didn't like a few of the items) and one that was about $4k higher.  I'd have thought you could shave about $3 or $4k off that.  Which would put you in the ball park of it almost being paid for.  Even as it is, you're only paying $5k for a $14k system, which is a great deal.  But I get it... if you just bought a new system a year ago... seems silly to spend another $5k now.  But if you can get that price shaved by a few k... might seem silly to not take advantage of rebates that can be pulled at any time.  Especially if we have a change of government.

"I'm asking about working inside those bureaucracies, it's about what is rewarded.

In your business how do you evaluate excellence in your employees? You are asserting that money *motivates* excellence but then in your business you're *rewarding* excellence.

Are you sure that it's the money that makes them excellent? Or is the money just making them loyal.

Would they be less excellent if you paid them less?

In my observation I see that excellent producers  motivated by a drive for exploration, for invention,  for contribution. Some are well rewarded but many are not even recognized by a bureaucratic management that values compliance and *bureaucratic* ambition.

An employee who says I want to grow into senior management is more valued than an employee who says I want to work on interesting software.

"Sure. 

We both have seen that when the price per barrel goes up, gas prices go up immediately. When the price per barrel goes down, it lags, and rarely drops back to the original lower price. The reason given is that it takes time for them to run through the more expensive gas bought from more expensive barrels. Ask yourself, why doesn't the price going up also lag given that they have to run through the lower cost gas per barrel?

Here is an inflation adjusted Crude Oil Price chart [https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart) 

Per barrel prices are not the highest they have ever been, however prices at the pump (before taxes). Note: Gas in BC is West Texas Intermediate, as Alberta is land locked and realistically only has large pipelines to the Texas refineries (yes there are small ones in Burnaby and in Washinton state as well). 

I was also around when Alberta switched from the 7% hidden Manufacturers Sales Tax to the GST. The list price of goods did not change, but the GST sure got tacked on.

">I'm suggesting we remove the carbon tax 

Would you have us reduce our carbon emissions? If not through the carbon tax, how? If you don't offer some explanation or reasoning here, nobody will take you seriously.

>reorganize ... budgets ... to pay for X

If it is possible to magically find money like that, I'm in!

>Essentially what you are saying is, this rebate would have existed anyways 

Sort of. ICBC could have not issued the rebate and just lowered future rates. Imo not a huge difference.

>Horgan is essentially doing nothing

Sort of. ICBC went through changes (moving to no-fault) which played a role in the current surplus. Horgan is partially responsible for the changes.

I haven't really offered my opinion yet but here it is: We shouldn't subsidize carbon emissions, we should do the opposite.

Not only is ICBC not multinational.. meaning that most of its transactions are within a single country—a single province of the country no-less…. But it’s also an insurance company that deals with payments to customer en-mass on a daily basis. 

So what are the costs, really?  They already have accounts set up for paying. They already have the employees in place for approval and financial control and accounts payable. They already have the machinery to print and package and address cheques and they simply go to every registered owner they have in their already established database. 

The fixed costs are amortized over the sheer number of cheques they will write which is practically nothing and would have to be spent anyways… and the direct costs of power, paper, ink, envelope, postage are insignificant. What.. $5 a cheque, maybe?

"I have become inspired by Cobourg Ontario to TRY my hardest to create a 7 Feathers Crosswalk Initative within my own community and to expand this initiative to other communities both near and far.

I contacted my local Mayor, Brad West of the city of Port Kwikwetlem (a.k.a) Coquitlam, on messenger (for a more prompt response), on his personal messenger as well as the city of Port Kwikwetlem and proposed my initiative and surprisingly Mayor Brad West was right on board with the initative as well as other city staff. I've officially been invited to a cultural round table meeting to further discuss the 7 Feathers Crosswalk Initative. Kwikwetlem First Nations is also on board as well.

I reached out to countless other Mayor's within my area also on their private and city messenger's and only TWO Mayor's got back to me, thus far. Mayor Mary Ann Booth of West Vancouver, also loved the idea. I've also been invited to another meeting with the city of West Vancouver to further discuss the 7 Feathers Crosswalk Initative.

I'm shamelessly begging & pleading with EVERYONE to PLEASE help me expand the 7 Feathers Crosswalk Initative with me and to personally contact EVERY SINGLE First Nations Community to propose the idea of the 7 Feathers Crosswalk Initative as well as their local Mayor's and City official.

SOME people may shrug this all off and just go about there day without thinking WHY this is so vital to our communities.

I didn't learn much of anything in regards to residential schools, the trauma & pain or much of anything for that matter about the indigenous culture and history, while in elementary or high school it was all WHITEWASHED history, I think MANY will agree with me.

Those that don't are the ones that NEED to become educated. The pain of the atrocities of the horrifying abuses and loss of so many precious children that lost their lives and did not make it back home to their families, trickles down for GENERATIONS to come and does NOT GO AWAY, just because somebody says it should.

These atrocities are a STAIN upon Canadians and isn't what we should NOT represent or stand for.

It's time for VALIDATION (something that SHOULD of been done MANY years ago) and to let the healing begin.

I hope that when people drive or walk by a 7 Feathers Crosswalk, that they remember what happened and it evokes deep thought and meaningful conversation amongst individuals.

I WANT CHILDREN TO ASK their teachers, talk to their peers, parents, siblings and elders and for it to be an ongoing conversation for future GENERATIONS to come.

Please join me on this journey.

They also got cooling with a heat pump... and the interior summers definitely aren't getting any cooler.  Makes good financial sense to make the switch now while rebates are available vs waiting until you have to when rebates may no longer be available and having to spend even more!

The whole ""why bother because of ""X"""" is such a bullshit fallacy.  Why bother ever doing anything.  What most people don't realize is that hard regulations are being enforced all the time and getting stricter.  It's also now cheaper to build green power infrastructure going forward.  Green tech is slowly (in some place rapidly evolving).  Cruise ships are more and more accessing shore power... it may take time but things are changing. Have a friend that owns a marine company and he was just in Turkey working on a partnership between 3 different organizations to start building a fleet of electric tug boats.  A local float plane company that flys over 500,000 passengers a year on short haul commuter and leisure flights has been testing their electric plane for 3 years and will be putting the first into service next year.   China and India have the largest solar power plants in the world(multiples of them) and are rapidly building more. Back in 2018 China was adding a London-sized electric bus fleet every five weeks!!!  Shit is happening now, fast.  So while some people moan about not doing anything because the big players aren't doing anything... they'll get left behind pretty quickly because the big players are in fact doing much more than we should be.

So, while industries ARE being regulated and ARE making changes... the general population needs to make changes now as well.  Many small percentages equal up to large percentages.",t2_5mfnu,iWish_is_taken,0,1648241792.0,0,t1_i2448fa,i2448fa,False,cyclinginvancouver,t3_tnpyz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tnpyz9/icbc_relief_rebate_coming_for_drivers/,ICBC relief rebate coming for drivers,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tnpyz9/icbc_relief_rebate_coming_for_drivers/i2448fa/,1,r/britishcolumbia,0,1

"Yes I think they work. Carbon taxes do not work overnight but if the next time you purchase a vehicle, furnace, windows etc, you decide to to be more efficient then it is working. 

If heavy polluters are choosing to just pay carbon offsets theoretically there is still a net reduction in carbon emissions. If a coal power plant builds a methane capture facility for a landfill they reduced emissions. Maybe not directly at their plant but in another area why shouldn’t they receive credit for that? Net reduction in emissions is good. 

All emissions of greenhouse gasses are causing environmental harm. Transportation, industry, power generation etc. Why only target some for reductions? Carbon taxes should be even across the board so everyone is doing their part. 

I am not concerned about industry and corporations leaving. The federal cooperate tax rate in Canada was 25% in 2000, today it’s 15. There is plenty of room for tax increases.

"Sounds like you don’t know what you’re talking about, nor do you understand how ICBC worked prior to this year or how the new ‘no fault’ system works. 

This is literally what everyone was asking for: no more exaggerated ‘pain and suffering’ payouts for borderline fraudulent claims, no more frivolous litigation, no more 3 year court cases to get an injury payout with no compensation or injury benefits in the meantime, no more exorbitant insurance premiums to finance it all.

“If you’re unable to work due to an injury from a crash, income replacement benefits will cover 90 per cent of your net income up to a maximum of $100,000 gross income. These benefits can begin eight days after the crash.

First other provinces do use it to reduce carbon or make it revenue neutral. It used to be that way in BC. Secondly if you have to heat a home, heat your water, or live/work where an electric vehicle will not do for you and you have done all you can to lower your consumption and there is NOTHING else you can do then how does this tax  help other then making you poorer?

Seriously the only thing I could do to lower my fuel consumption would be to put in a heat pump. My vehicle sits in my driveway days at a time without being driven. The savings of the heat pump would not break even to the cost of the heat pump for almost 30 years and by that time it would have needed some major servicing extending that.

"Just curious, do you think the existing carbon tax has helped reduce emissions? Or do people just grunt and bear the increase in tax and keep on keepin on. 

Don't corporations and heavy polluting industries just pump out a ton of emissions and pay for it with carbon offsets so they can claim reduced emissions? 

If an industrial plant is pumping out co2 and buying carbon offsets do we really know if that money is fully offsetting by future actions? Planting trees etc?  Who's keeping track? 

It is estimated that all modes of  transportation accounts for only 15% of annual  emissions. So why do they keep increasing taxes at the pump. 

Industrial practices make up 31 percent of emissions and the generation of electricity accounta for 27%. We can reduce carbon emissions greatly by introducing carbon recapture technologies, and investing in clean renewable energy. It's just expensive and there's alot of political red tape.

"I believe everything you speak of in already in the works. Lots of money being put into transit as well as bike lanes, ebike rebates, continued EV rebates and the province’s push to go full EV. 

This is a relatively short term issue as well, so once the Ukraine situation resolves or at least the switch from Russian dependence is sorted, we’ll go back. 

Also, the biggest incentive to push people to alternatives is the carbon tax and high gas prices. People may not like it, but it been proven to be the best way forward. Spikes like this may not be fun but it at least gives some people the hit they need to realize that this IS our future. Be the change you want to see.  We can’t just sit around and wait for the government to do everything for us as well. 

I started making moves a couple years ago… no longer have gas at the house and use a heat pump. One of our cars is a PHEV and when we replace our little gas sipping commuter it’ll be an EV.  I figured out and starting commuting by bike during the Spring/Summer/Fall at least a few days a week. 

This isn’t a surprise… the writing has been on the wall for years. It’s not like gas/fuel is going to get cheaper. 

Anyway, I trust our current government, and the more you do research on the subject the more you realize this was probably the best path forward, even if it was really more of a political move to appease those screaming for something to be done about gas prices.

"At first, I feel you are trolling.. but I’ll respond to a few of your comments. I’m not interested in carrying a long debate here. I also don’t expect to change your mind, and that’s ok.

Our ESG policies are actually making us quite intolerant of each other. I’m not “allowed” to even debate my opinions about, say, a transgender swimmer that has a physically unfair advantage due to a self-identification that doesn’t align with my beliefs.

If that triggers you, this is exactly one specific example of government overreach, coercing my fellow citizens and employers to scrutinize my own freedom of expression, so that I can’t even bring it up without being socially outcast. I should be just as free to express my opinion as the person whom identifies differently than my expression. Otherwise, we may as well consider this a socially-oppressive society, if I have to check my honest thoughts and feelings at the door. There’s a slogan: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Well, we’re basically there - the darkness being the jeopardizing oppression toward our freedoms of expression.

Biased media refers to all of our major media companies being subsidized, influenced, and coerced by our government. The news “stories” are a fabricated narrative that does not represent any real truth, which brainwashes our mass population with a single crafted perspective. Again, when I challenge this, I’m socially outcast for challenging it. Instead, I should have the freedom to think critically and speak my thoughts, and to not have those thoughts rejected simply because they go against the media’s collective message.

"My first apartment wasn’t bad. But my landlord would only take cash or cheques dropped into her mailbox, and then we had to text her after letting her know we’d paid. If it wasn’t put in in the morning, I’d get several texts and calls that she would only be at the building until 1 and we had to pay or we’d be late because she couldn’t pick it up that day. I would go home from classes to pay her. Now I know I have until midnight so I’d tell her tough titties.

Then we moved into the top level of a house, but the landlords son lived below and our hydro was on the same account, that we had to pay and the son would pay us his share. His son literally never did, and would leave his tv on all hours of the day. He was admitted to the hospital for 2 weeks and the tv was on the whole time, landlord wouldn’t enter his suite to turn it off. That bill was $700, and he wouldn’t pay up. The landlord was also very sexist and creepy, wouldn’t repair things that were a safety hazard. Our toilet was unusable for 2 days so we had to drive ti the mall near us to use the bathroom. Our back staircase to access the yard and laundry room became unusable so we had to scale a fence to do laundry or sit in our yard. I would have thrown the book so hard at him. He was such a POS. He intentionally let his dog terrorize my elderly, sick cat in his carrier when I wasn’t looking. My boyfriend thankfully noticed and moved our cat. He also tossed a jug of bleach into the car while we were moving that was open, and got bleach all over our clothes, car seat, cat carrier, and linens. Fuck that guy. 

Our worst landlords came late in our renting experience, and we did throw the book at them. They wanted us to sign a new lease after our  6 month lease was up with a higher rent and longer lease, we said no we’ll stick to month to month. They wanted to keep our damage deposit because they insisted there was an odour that my husband and I, my mom, my sister, and the neighbour walking by who heard our landlords screaming at us so she popped in could not smell.

"I got in an accident and it’s a fucking shit show that doesn’t cover the costs it’s a joke


Here’s my last communication with the experts. 

”Hello, 

I am writing to discuss the follow up phone call from yesterday that I was not overly happy with some of the comments that were made throughout the conversation. From my initial discussion with the first agent who contacted me it was my understanding that ICBC would be reaching out a couple times throughout the 3 month process to follow up on the injuries and track progress. Yesterday was the first phone time I have had a follow up conversation with ICBC and it came after the medical benefits have expired. During this conversation yesterday it was commented that I am defensive with short answers, that the recovery is taking longer than it should and insinuating that I am not trying to get better with comments that I need to be in charge of my recovery. 

Being my first accident since the new structure of ICBC the support to get started on a program with ICBC is zero, you're told here's some treatments that don't cover the cost of them, no you don't get any compensation for missing work and no we wont help you with finding a good treatment location. So from the get go the tone of the treatment from ICBC has been cold and non supportive. I arrange times with RMT's, Kinesiologists and Physio as best as I can, when the appointments were available I was going 4x a week to treatments. While going to these treatments I was required to miss time from work which has cost me thousands of dollars which I will not see or get back. During our phone call the agent asked various questions regarding my doctor and if I had follow up appointments with my doctor or if I have had X-Rays. 

The conversation at this time was how I need to be in charge of my recovery, although I respect the opinions of ICBC's agents and that they have dealt with many cases I do not believe that the medical advise and comments of the agent were appropriate. I visited my doctor after the accident and told him whom I had set appoints up with, he said that's good and continue with that. Through the weeks I have sent emails to the doctor to ask if a follow up is needed before the march 7th ICBC cut off date, to which I have not got a reply until late yesterday. Other comments on the call were regarding the ""treatment"" plan that I have received at Physio, I have not received one, I go bi weekly to the treatments and I follow the direction of the trained medical professional. I do not go into physio and dictate what exercises or plan that the physiotherapist has and I continue to work on what they tell me to work on. The last of the comments are in regards to the letter that the treatment facilities have sent over to ICBC and how what I'm reporting to ICBC is different than what the Physio/Kinesiology team sent over. I do not and still have not received what information they have sent over, 

I have continued to communicate my restrictions, how I feel, the aches and pains that continue on a daily basis. I am not in control of what a 3rd party sends over and the amount of effort that was put into the letter. The insinuation that either I am lying on the phone to ICBC or failing to put in adequate efforts to recover are unwarranted and offensive. I continue to try to book and go to treatments, I continue to miss work which has cost me thousands, I continue to miss paid for sports like hockey, and I continue to have pain on a daily basis which was not there before. So if I sound defensive, its because of the comments, tone and direction of the meeting when I am being told that my back shouldn't hurt this long, I should be doing more, and I should be communicating more to persons I am meeting with. I do not believe that those comments are just, because where I sit I'm discussing with someone how I feel and they are telling me I am wrong. From a supportive side of things ICBC has not followed up prior to the 3 month mark to see how treatments are going, have not provided any direction to treatment centers, and have not requested anything special like X-rays. As I am the one who being affected by the back injury, I hope that my input for my treatment under insurance that I pay for is taken into account when extending treatments. It is not my wish to be attending any treatments, in fact I find it a major inconvenience to me personally, financially, my romantic life etc that I am still dealing with this back injury, and if it were up to me I would be healed as well, unfortunately that is not the case and I do apologize that its inconvenient to ICBC that I am still injured.”",t2_68hky6mu,jeywgosjeb,0,1648229197.0,0,t1_i238x7r,i238x7r,False,cyclinginvancouver,t3_tnpyz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tnpyz9/icbc_relief_rebate_coming_for_drivers/,ICBC relief rebate coming for drivers,/r/britishcolumbia/comments/tnpyz9/icbc_relief_rebate_coming_for_drivers/i238x7r/,2,r/britishcolumbia,0,2

"Ah so ICBC made it so people with legitimate injuries cannot sue them, and that people are at the mercy of what the minimal medical/physio benefits they think are sufficient even for severe accidents, so now they are profiting like crazy, and now the government is giving out anyone with a vehicle $110 cheques indiscriminately. 

ICBC needs to be dismantled it shouldn’t be a for profit “social service” that only benefits the rich. 

And yes I say it benefits the rich because the reason for their record profits is the amount of people that lost their jobs in the pandemic and then went on CERB/CRB, and then got in accidents - ICBC doesn’t have to pay these people wage loss at all because government aid doesn’t count as your salary.

"I don't want to sound rude but you are so far off. Prices of existing houses have skyrocketed and it's nothing to do with the price of fuel. You can buy a modular home for $200k and deliver that on a semi, but there's no reasonably priced land to put it on. There really isn't that much land clearing required to build a house, this heavy equipment you're talking about won't be on a job long, and you can fit the materials for a house on a few truck loads.

As for iron ore ships. The Mary river mine (in what is Nunavut these days, you're giving your age away there) is by no means one of the largest iron ore mines in the world. Quite small compared to those in Brazil and Australia, and it's not the most profitable. Capesize iron ore cargo ships carry 200,000 tons of ore and use around 50 tons of heavy fuel per day, currently sitting at $1000/ton. So $50k in fuel a day to carry cargo that can change in value by millions of dollars in a few days, it's insignificant.

When I moved in they cautioned me that they had rules to deal with him and his dislike of noise - but I wasn’t expecting the large list they handed me. 

 For example -  couldn’t walk on any sections of the floor above his suite past 10PM, no dogs allowed to chew any bone or toy in the house, couldn’t wash the dishes or run any loud appliances past a certain time… it was awful. I hit my limit when his girlfriend would come over and block me in the garage. It was a good day when I left that place.
