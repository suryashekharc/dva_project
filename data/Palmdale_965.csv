"If we are specifically talking about the cities, you have Barrel Springs Trail, which is an easy family trail, about an hour to complete.

We have the Prime Desert Woodland Preserve, another nice family trail that's in West Lancaster. 

There's the whole Joshua Ranch Loop hiding behind the West Palmdale Aquaduct which has a lot of meandering trails to take; a lot of mountain bikers frequent the area. You can enter via Avenue P-12.

There's Mount McDill if you ever wanted to hike to the top of that one mountain that overlooks the Antelope Valley from the Southwest.

If you're willing to drive a bit, there's an immense amount of hiking to be had in the Angeles National Forest. 

I particularly recommend Grass Mountain for starters who want to hike in the great outdoors, near Green Valley. Easy to Moderate, should take 4-5 hours total, beautiful views from the top with lovely pine trees that produce the biggest pine cones you've ever seen. 

Red Rock Canyon State Park, an hour north of us is quite stunning in its beautiful eroded structures and vistas. Should be nice to hike in the winter, not when it's summer since it's very easy to get heat stroke with how hot and barren it is. 

Placerita Canyon State Park near Santa Clarita is a wonderful, chill hike, with luscious grass and crossings of small creeks. If you'd like you can be adventurous and go to the top of Los Pinetos, where you can see both the Santa Clarita Valley and San Fernando Valley!

For Angeles National Forest proper, a good hike for the first foray would be Switzer Falls, gets a bit busy with all the Angelenos visiting, but it's because it's very pretty and easy to do. 

For more moderate hiking, Pacifico Mountain is along the N2, a real forest hike where you can take the Pacific Crest Trail up (and see thru-hikers depending on the time of year) and see a great view of all of the Antelope Valley and the Forest. 

For particulars regarding specific trails, and to explore other potential ones, I use AllTrails, which is a an app/database of trails around you with all the necessary info.",t2_ei1dz,Sir_Awesome_The_3rd,0,1644472084.0,0,t1_hwc047k,hwc047k,False,Jklolzebra,t3_sn92or,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmdale/comments/sn92or/new_to_palmdale/,New to Palmdale,/r/palmdale/comments/sn92or/new_to_palmdale/hwc047k/,2,r/palmdale,0,2

"For a slight comparison, minimum wage in california (and LA county including palmdale/lancaster) is $15/hr or 30K/year.

I've seen people here who live on minimum wage, but I wouldn't say it's comfortable.

At 55K/year you're looking at 1.8x minimum wage or approximately $13.29/hr in other states.

If that sounds comfortable to you then go for it. I personally wouldn't.

A few things to keep in mind in Los Angeles County, sales taxes are 10%, but doesn't include food (including pre-packaged and frozen foods - only ready-to-eat foods are taxed) so if your main ""living expense"" is food-type items it could be cheaper here than other places. Electricity, Gas, Housing, etc, are all more expensive here than a lot of places.

Then she will say that those scientists are brought out by liberal media. I thought conservatives don't believe in science? Well anyways, I enjoy reading 2urknees post because it gives me a huge image of how certain people look at this whole vax situation. It makes a lot of people think they are smart but flat-out look stupid. They make it a big deal even tho Trump approved the vaccines and Operation Warp Speed leading to what we have now. Blame your cult leader for this. They refuse to blame Trump and blame Joe Biden for the vaccine and the mandates. How many excuses will 2urkness going to give us? Next, she's going to talk about how Dr. Fauci treatment on dogs but will refuse to ignore what has been happening in Slaughterhouses for years yet republicans want you to keep eating meat even tho you don't even know what's in it half of the time but still refuse to take the vaxx?!?! It's the same broken record when it comes to right-wingers.  I'm no fan of democrats also but I feel like calling yourself conservative is still as stupid as calling yourself a liberal. Get a new personality while you're at it. There's already too many wannabe Ted Cruz and Alex Jones out there. Also, Larry Elder doesn't give a shit about you.  Not one politician does.  Right and/or Left. 

as of today, California has the lowest transmission rate. We must be doing something right if we are this low since we were an epicenter at one point. Fearing that it might spike up again once the holidays are over but who knows what's going to happen it's all fake news, right?

Back to your issue with kids with the school vax mandates. Once again home school your kids if you're anti-vax. Also, learn to make sure they don't hate you when they grow up because you home school them. A lot of ""sources"" say that might happen when they get older?  WHO knows you might be the best mother ever. Make sure they are allowed to play deep state Fortnite because that might be the only time they can socialize with other kids. OH and also Make sure they read the real Bible that talks about rape and blood, instead of the republican one that cuts out the truth on how awful the bible is. 

Don't plan on writing back to any of your posts because once again. the same old right-winger broken record is playing again. Bye :)

"Yeah, we are from the DFW area!  My sister in law still lives in Austin.   I don‚Äôt believe you will have to worry too much, the friend whose wife who left was several years ago before the more recent awareness of those issues.  As far as I know she never experienced anything overtly aggressive or physically dangerous, it was mostly micro-aggressions, etc in the stores she frequented.   I know tensions in some areas were high against Asians during early covid, but I don‚Äôt recall any incidents locally.   This is a conservative area and have had peaceful pro trump truck trains, as well as peaceful BLM protests so definitely a wide mix of views.  One of the congressional districts here (there are two) has swapped Republican/Democrat/Republican and the last race was down to the wire.  


Expenses wise, houses are pricier, but property taxes are lower.   Home insurance is cheaper (hail is rare!) but doesn‚Äôt include earthquakes, which is an expensive add on.  Sales tax is high, and there are fewer things that get exempted from the full rate (cars for example are taxed at the full local rate as well as no trade in tax benefits).   Restaurant food seems more expensive, I think because of the sales tax policy.  Groceries seem similar priced as TX.  Energy is more expensive (by a lot!) and there is no fully deregulated market, so you have fewer to no choices.  Gas is, well, infamously expensive.  Auto insurance is high if you are commuting, as it is priced based off mileage.  Registration is a use tax based on the car value not just a fee, so expect sticker shock there.   Obviously there is the state income tax, but in addition the state has its own disability program, so there is a separate tax like the federal program.   

So‚Ä¶ yeah, mostly it‚Äôs more expensive.  Make sure you are accounting for that with pay negotiations.

"If you like seasons, snow, smaller town vibe Tehachapi is your place. 

Over 500,000 people live in the Lancaster/Palmdale area so for someone from the lower density States that might be something hard to get used to. Both cities are currently serviced by LA County sheriff's department.

California city has grown a lot as well as Rosamond. California City and tehachapi both have their own police departments. Where Rosamond is covered by Kern County sheriff, which leads to a somewhat dismal response time from law enforcement.  California city has a huge off-road draw. 

Lancaster and Palmdale are definitely growing on the food side of things slowly getting more and more options which is wonderful. Tehachapi has some nice restaurants, plus in Tehachapi you're closer to Bakersfield so you can hop on the 58 and head down that way and they have Basque food and other styles there as well.

"1. Its pretty mediocre, especially outside of lancaster/palmdale. In Mojave and Rosamond the best you are going to get is fast food. The AV has a pretty dissapointing pallet so new things don't typically survive unless its mexican food, sushi, or some kind of chain. Luckily some of the best dining in the world is about an hour and a half south. 
2. During rush hour it can kind of suck but its not like a major city where its stand still traffic jams, ultimately it depends where you are going at what time though. 
3. The main perk of the AV is lower cost of living while still being in CA, meaning the perks of being in CA (like LA, the beach, hiking) are a drive away. The AV has two types of people, those who work in the aircraft industry and those who don't, unfortunately those who don't are low-income/kicked out of LA due to gentrification/following their baby daddy who is in prison, and they sort of bring the area down. By that I mean we could have nice things but there are a lot of people who don't have money to support nice things. 
4. Have you considered moving to Tehachapi? Mojave is not too far away, and if you are an outdoorsy person there is a lot to do. They also have decent dining for such a small town. 
5. Plenty to do without going to LA depending on what you like to do. There is a hobby shop on the boulevard I think and a card shop in Palmdale. A lot of things do close early though, we were out at one of the brewerys recently and wanted to get something to eat around 9-10 pm, it was pretty difficult to get anything except in n out. 
6. Are you a POC? The AV is a very conservative area. That said there are lots of hispanic and african american people. If you are asian of any type its not really a good place to be, there is a small Filipino community. There are a lot of white supremacist types out here. 
7. Id be more worried about allergies from the desert dust and plants. There is no smog here. 

I'm guessing you are a guy, are you single? When we bring new engineers out here we joke that there's a girl behind every tree (its a desert, lol). What I'm saying is its going to be difficult to find a wife out here if you have any sort of standards.

"The desert is going to be a lot different than Huntsville, so if you can swing it (or the relocation package offers it) I recommend a visit.  It's hard to understand how few trees we have until you get here, LOL.

Food wise, there are lots of restaurants, but mostly chains or mom/pop type stuff, less of a ""foodie"" scene if that is what you are looking for.  But plenty of variety, albeit with a west coast flair.  Zero Tex Mex for example, but lots of Hawaiian, Baja fish tacos, etc stuff you might not find in AL.  Palmdale/Lancaster is larger than Tehachapi by quite a bit, so has more options.  Tehachapi is a smaller town, and is great if you want to live up off the desert floor.  

Traffic is easy within the valley.  Very little backups on Hwy 58 or Hwy 14 depending on which town you choose.  

I would say the selling point is the weather and lack of mosquitos in Palmdale/Lancaster.   Overall they are generic suburbia, with some rougher areas.  But being able to sit on my patio at dusk and not get eaten alive by mosquitos is pretty awesome.  Even when it gets up to 110 in the summer here, we still have cooler nights than you would in AL due to the lack of humidity.  

If you are looking for nightlife, neither area is going to be a hotspot, but Palmdale does have a comic and card store that hosts games.  I think Lancaster has one as well.  I think all three areas have community theaters, live music stuff, festivals, just depends on your interests.  I think a lot of folks head to LA for clubs though.  

Safety and crime is going to be a hot topic.  In general Tehachapi is a small rural town and has less crime.  Palmdale/Lancaster is a mixed bag.  I would take a look at local crime reports for each area and compare for yourself vs your current neighborhood.  We have lived on the west side of Palmdale since 2010 and have only encountered smaller stuff like porch pirates, Christmas decoration theft, etc but do have the local sheriff helicopter flying circles in the area frequently.   If you are going to be living in an apartment, the choices are generally poor and you might encounter more issues.  

As far as racism, I have no direct experience (not a minority), but in general the area seems to be more diverse vs where I lived in TX and neighborhoods are generally less segregated which is nice.     However, I have heard reports from friends that have experienced racism here, one who's Korean-born wife refuses to live here anymore since she encountered it so often.   This area does have some ugly history and we have seen some recent high profile issues that made the news.  I would like to think it isn't as common we saw when we lived in TX, but I have no idea honestly.   

Smog isn't too bad, however we do get DUST and your allergies may or may not be affected.  I am better in the desert, but some people are worse.   Going to depend on what your allergies are to.   We also get long ""seasons"" of wildfire smoke, which is a concern for asthma.  This year hasn't been too bad, but last year we had months of living in near constant wildfire smoke, it can get nasty.   

If you like the outdoors, this is a wonderful place.  Lots of dirt biking/off roading, hiking, skiing/snowboarding, etc.  We are 45 minutes from a small ski resort and 2 hours from surfing on the beach, you can actually do both in the same day during the winter!   Plus several national parks within an easy drive.",t2_rguk6,Az_Rael77,0,1635273513.0,0,t1_hi5b2w0,hi5b2w0,True,tupurl,t3_qg9a17,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmdale/comments/qg9a17/palmdalelancastertehachapi_area_for_a_prospective/,Palmdale/Lancaster/Tehachapi area for a prospective newcomer,/r/palmdale/comments/qg9a17/palmdalelancastertehachapi_area_for_a_prospective/hi5b2w0/,3,r/palmdale,0,3

"**What's the food scene like? Is there a good variety of restaurants and cuisines?**  
  
*Lots of fast food, quite a few of the larger chains, and some local gems like Saku Sake and Lee Esters.*

**How bad is traffic?**  
  
*That depends. It's not terrible heading north, but the quality of drivers has really deteriorated in the last decade.*

**How big would you say the city is? If you were to describe the selling points of living there, what would you say?**  
  
*Palmcaster sits at about 500,000 and is a mix of suburban and rural. I love that we are in the middle of just about anything. Mountains, lakes, rivers, LA, anything.*

**What are some things you wish you knew when you moved to the area?**  
  
*Didn't move here, but a few things you should know is it gets windy. Also, it's hot and dry. Get a swamp cooler.*

**Are there a decent number of things to do in the area without having to drive to LA? E.g. are there board game stores/ places for other leisurely activities. Not a big nightlife person but does everything close by like 9pm?**  
  
*I'm not sure if the game stores are still open. There were a couple. Many folks enjoy the breweries. Both major cities put on concerts and events throughout the year. If you like the outdoors, walks, hiking, geocaching, off-roading, you'll have a dandy time.*

**Are the towns safe? I know this is CA but are there instances of like racism I should be worried about? Or just general safety concerns to keep in mind?**  
  
*Safeish. Ever since the idiot DA Gascon got put in and stopped prosecuting criminals things have gotten worse. It's disgusting. That said, there's still a lot of great people who live here. Stay away from Division Street and things are generally pretty good. Actual racism? Haven't really seen in in a few decades. Plenty of examples of fake woke racism, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll find it.* 

**How bad are things like smog and allergies in the area? As someone with asthma should I be worried?**

*Air quality is usually pretty good, except in fire season. If you're allergic to Russian thistle (like I am) spring and fall can be rough.*

"1. Well, there's not much of a food scene in Mojave. It's a small town barely kept alive by the aerospace industry and as a gas stop on your way north. The closest towns to Mojave would be California City and Tehachapi, but they're both pretty small as well. Next closest would be Rosemond, but your best choices would be for Palmdale or Lancaster. Palmdale has the better food choices with your normal fast food a sit down chains as well as smaller Mexican, Thai, Indian, Cuban, and Mediterranean places. They're generally pretty decent. Lancaster has a few places as well, but not as many as Palmdale.

2. Traffic to and from any place you move to in the high desert is going to be very minimal. All the traffic goes south from Palmdale and Lancaster down into Los Angeles. If the weather gets bad then you'll have some issues, but other than that you'll be fine. Just make sure you have a vehicle you don't mind getting sand blasted.

3. Palmdale and Lancaster are definitely the biggest cities in the high desert. They sprung up to house those working in the aerospace industry but in the 80's became a bedroom community for Los Angeles. I wouldn't consider both of them small to cities, but that's based on me having grown up in Los Angeles. Both cities have their issues. If you hop on the AV Scanner page on Facebook you would think both cities were lawless, crime-ridden, hell holes. I'm not saying that they're not, but it's livable. As for selling points...ummm....It would be close to work?

4. I moved here when I was younger. I would say for someone who has never been here before, get used to dry, 100+ degree days during the summer and mostly dry freezing winters. It does snow from time to time so be prepared for that. Winds can get pretty bad at time. Don't freak out anytime you hear a loud bang. Chances are it's a sonic boom from Edwards AFB. If you hear a gun shot, chances are it's just fireworks...except when it isn't. If you decide to go exploring the desert or mountains (highly suggested, there are some great trails in the mountains and the desert has a lot of history), let someone know where you're planning on going and when you plan to get back. Bring plenty of water with you.

5. If you're into tabletop games and stuff, there are groups you can find. You'll find a pretty active gaming community. I have a weekly D&D group. I'm part of a Warhammer group at my job. We have a Warhammer Store in Palmdale, plus a few comic/pop shops that sell games and MtG/Pokemon/Yugi-oh cards. Bases in Lancaster is probably the biggest and runs tournaments. Sun-Thu a lot of things close early. Palmdale has Transplants micro brew which puts on shows now during the week and weekends. They have some big named acts that roll through from time to time.

6. Like I said earlier, if you get on the AV Scanner Facebook page it'll seem like the city is burning down. Is it bad, Yeah, but I don't know if it's any better or any worse than anywhere else. Palmdale is probably a little quieter than Lancaster. You'll run into some racism out here, but it isn't as prevalent as it was in the past. I think a lot of it has to do with the neighborhood you move into. Biggest advice would be to go about your normal business and if you see something brewing, go the other way.

7. The smog isn't too bad up here. We do have farms in the area but are mostly agricultural. Some people do get permits to burn brush so you might experience a little smoke, but generally on the outskirts of town and in the smaller desert communities. The wind does blow a lot out here and sometimes kicks up some pretty nasty dust storms.

If your religion had some legit excuse to NOT get a vax, then you proved you would ignore that by getting a vax yourself, meaning it no longer applies to you. NOT that your kids worship your every whim and god complex because you had a NDE that you're too lazy to understand has been explained by scientists for decades and is simply a delusion. 

And I'd have absolutely no problem speaking this way to your face because you'd devolve into sputtering nonsense when faced with calm rational arguments instead of your incoherent ramblings.

">Lol, your fantasy reddit account is debating my fantasy reddit account on your fantasies about what Trump said.

My account is not a fantasy ??? maybe yours is, nothing I have said is a fantasy, nor does it have a damn thing to do with anything Trump says/or has said. The only fantasy is in your head where you actually think that anything that you are  stating has relevance in reality at all whatsoever. 

>Just ridiculous that you think the video says what you think it says, it doesn't, 

Oh yeah and what ridiculous thing do I think it says ? Don't ever play escape room or clue because you have'nt got any

>but I doubt you actually watched it because you were busy letting the alt tubers tell you what it said. 
Yes, buddy whatever you said even though that is not even where this video was found and all of the comments are turned off of the video but you go ahead with your fantasies, just don't place any bets on them.

Bahahaha That is reality it cannot Trump reality because it is reality, there isn't a fact check in the world that can discredit one's actual real life experiences,

More fantasy. You live in your own little town called Delusion.

>At some point there are experts that know more than you

Yes, the experts in the video know more, Wow not a word of relevance. 

>You dismiss my experience of having covid side effects and I guess I'll just dismiss your attribution of them to vaccines in return.

another lie, are you sure that you are even still responding to the same person ? oh what am I saying you aren't sure of anything.

Only the video on YouTube is of the actual research data and directly from the FDA. YOu should try to save some face here seriously and stop commenting on things that you cannot comprehend.

The rest of what you  said is just as irrelevant and still does not apply. Of course your account is a throw away how would anyone speak the nonsense that you do and be proud of it. And you have the audacity to talk about someone speaking to their elders in any kind of way, I would bet you don't even have any kids.

Honestly the more you speak the utterly ridiculous you sound at this point, if you even could comprehend what is on the video my guess is you can't what with the spewing diarrea that continues to project from your mouth.

Who the F is screaming about my side effects? It was and is a necessary fact to include. There thousands of others with documented cases. All of these are lies to I suppose.  You write like a twit.

>magicking up some some religious reasoning out of the blue that you just say ""religiously I think I can do whatever I want.""

Nope it's actually the law braniac, you should spend more time in a book. Educating yourself. 
No one can be forced to do/not do anything that counters their religious beliefs, and there is not a d@mn thing that the Government can do about it because of the separation of state and church. It is actually beautiful.

Show me where I stated any of this, 
better yet show me where this makes an actual sentence.

Your a liar your just making up side effects for sympathy.  
How the F do you even figure? How the F would you get covid from me? 
I am double vaxxed I wear my useless mask everywhere don't you?  I got covid almost 2 years ago and I loved over 50 miles from here. You should be safe right? STFU DA

The only chaos is in the tiny minority that think they're in the majority. Absolutely some nurses and doctors and soon federal employees will refuse to get vaxxed.

Your right, it isn't going to stop anytime soon,  but your wrong about this being the way to stop it. Already we have more deaths this year than all of last year put together and their rising,  the covid cases are still rising. If you feel like taking a look at that fda board hearing they discuss the possibility of the vaccine causing a spread and they also show a slide of I believe it is Bangladesh (a city in India) that is 100% covid free and they have not had a single vaccine. 
They are 100% covid free simply by herd immunity.

That I believe would be the 3rd time that the FDA refused to approve it when gathering all of the data, all of the scientific feedback and study results.

This come back is irrelevant.  

# 1 It is not FDA Approved ( all the other vaccines had been approved, first) 

# 2 Covid -19 vaccine does not work the same as other vaccines, they are not in the same classification as other vaccines. ( They do not just infect you with a lil virus or antibodies to boost your immunity, but the mRNA vaccines work in the way that they kill off certain protein cells within your body, of which Covid attaches itself onto to live, so they eliminate those cells) 

#3 mRNA while having been studied for years by scientists,  it has not ever before been used as a vaccine,  nor within humans. 
 
#4 There has not been enough testing on humans using mRNA as a vaccine, especially long term and especially in children.

"Bakersfield is a shit hole. You don't want to live there. It's also a two hour commute to Lancaster/Palmdale, and it's not a pleasant one. 

The commute going south into LA from the av kinda sucks. Lots of traffic. The commute going north up to the av is ok, so Santa Clarita/Valencia commute up won't be too bad, unless he's working at Edwards. 

As far as hospitals, like other commenters have said, there's two full hospitals in the av. There's a hospital in newhall, and silmar has a notable hospital too, although the commutes start to wear about that point. 

If you were asking about Bakersfield because there's a place there you want to work, I'd recommend against it. That city fucking sucks. It's a pit. If that doesn't dissuade you, though, tehachipi basically splits the difference between there and the AV and is a pretty nice place to live if you're ok with small mountain towns in the middle of nowhere. 

Final point to note, since you're east coast:  you'll need a car, no matter where you end up, and you'll be driving a lot. An hour drive to get anywhere is normal. Fifteen minutes to the store is pretty close.

For other interesting things: tehachapi loop is an interesting train loop where on a mountain where trains can be on top of themselves as they climb the mountain in a circle. There's also tons of aviation stuff out here. 

Check out blackbird air park, and then go to BJs corner (Sierra highway and ave N) and go plane watching from the end of the runway.

"Not much to do in LLA itself (I've lived here for 30+ years). But, if you like movies, there's a couple of movie sets out here, and the church from Kill Bill. It's only a couple of hours worth of entertainment, and you can't actually go on the movie sets, but it's neat!

Other than that, all we really have is the the park, the library, the ""indian"" muesum, and Saddleback. Technically, there's also ATVing, but you're not legally allowed to do that in most places. You can always drive down the lake bed in el mirage for legal ATVing. 

You can also hike on a lot of the hills around here, but not in this heat. (We have a surprising amount of pokestops/gyms out here too if you're into PoGo) Uh...there's a lot of abandoned houses and creepy looking places out in the more distant areas if you like spooky stuff?

"This was extremely well written and I appreciate you taking the time to explain it and your emphasis to clarify that it was not a personal attack. I certainly don't want to displace anyone but from my perspective in that industry it's a dying industry and if someone doesn't come on with new job opportunities soon so will the AV. We are already seeing people sell their homes and leave due to rising prices in LA as more commuters move out here to find affordable housing. Thankfully thats helping put money in locals pockets but people are still moving.  It's the same problem I see with the coal mining states and oil fields. Locals are going to continue to fight to keep those jobs around because they don't have any other jobs they can do. As automation continues to evolve we as a society are going to have to train blue collar workers to do new jobs, most of which are currently considered tech. Because eventually their jobs will be automated. Fighting that change only slows progress and costs all of us more money in the long term.",t2_15xcju,knarlygoat,0,1629895604.0,0,t1_haab0ib,haab0ib,False,justanotherbot89,t3_p9opy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmdale/comments/p9opy6/why_are_residents_in_the_av_obsessed_with_cops/,Why are residents in the AV obsessed with cops and veterans?,/r/palmdale/comments/p9opy6/why_are_residents_in_the_av_obsessed_with_cops/haab0ib/,2,r/palmdale,0,2
"I‚Ä¶ kind of don‚Äôt know what to say to this? I‚Äôd like to clarify that I‚Äôm reading your comment as you coming from a genuine place where you were trying to be helpful, and I appreciate that! I‚Äôm not trying to attack you, and please don‚Äôt take this as me insulting you or what you said in any way, but I‚Äôm concerned that what you‚Äôre arguing for here is (again, I think unintentionally) elitist, and, more importantly, won‚Äôt do anything to address the actual issue at hand. 

The problem isn‚Äôt that entire chunks of the population are inherently reactionary or conservative, and the solution isn‚Äôt that these chunks of the population should simply be moved Elsewhere if one would like to turn any given area‚Äôs electoral map slightly bluer‚Äîthat‚Äôs just demonstrably not true, and can lead to some incredibly dangerous reductionist thoughts about class and racial systems in America. The problem is this: the white working class is, on average, more conservative than much of the population because right-wingers have for centuries now fought for the white working class to view their neighbors of color‚Äîpeople of color in general‚Äîas the enemy and the people who keep them from rising in social status, when in reality the fault for this lies with the same right-wingers who push this narrative. They know that the working class, regardless of race or other divisions, have more power and a stronger voice when they are united, so they sew seeds of dissent to discourage working class unity. *That* is why the white working class is overwhelmingly conservative‚Äîbecause the people in power want them to be, tell them that it‚Äôs the immigrants who take their jobs (when it is the CEOs who cut them, or outsource them to countries where it is easier to abuse worker‚Äôs rights), that equality between us whites and people of color will ensure a loss of our rights (or a white genocide, which, *lmao*), and so on and so forth. It‚Äôs been this way since the abolition of slavery in America, but the seeds for it were planted with the very invention of race as a construct itself. On that note, the working class/those without a college degree, regardless of race,  are on the whole more conservative than the educated elite of their respective ethnicities because of these narratives as well.

As such, kicking the manufacturing jobs out the valley won‚Äôt solve anything. Hell, bringing in tech companies and startups won‚Äôt solve anything. Sure, it‚Äôll make the AV lean more left electorally, but at the cost of people who have lived here for generations losing their jobs, their homes, and in some cases their lives. I‚Äôm not unbiased in this, either; generations of my family have worked in those plants. My grandparents, my father, and now my brother is studying at AVC to try and get a job at Northrop. 

What you‚Äôre arguing for is essentially gentrification, and I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say gentrification quite literally kills people. And it would be the poor whites, the working class people of color who would be effected‚Äîdisplaced from their homes by a workforce that is overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly affluent, that work for companies that overwhelmingly *do not care* about those that their policies displace and kill. 

The way to shift the working class to the left is by actually engaging with them; organizing with them, both within and outside of workplaces. Make them (us!) see the ways in which we have been lied to, the ways we can organize with our coworkers and comrades of color to achieve better working and living conditions for all. Change doesn‚Äôt start or end with electoral politics or workplace organizing, and our actions should reflect this, I think. 

If you‚Äôd like, I can hook you up with some resources for the history of the things I discussed, organizing tips, ideas for conversations about these issues, etc. 

Again, I really want to emphasize that I‚Äôm not trying to attack you, and I genuinely appreciate your original comment.

"Several reasons, but it largely boils down to demographics and history. For most of the time that it‚Äôs been the AV as we currently know it (post the establishment of Edwards and Northrup/Skunkworks/etc, that is) the AV has most been inhabited by white people, many of whom are conservative, and many of whom have ties to the military, specifically because the AV as we know it basically grew around Edwards after it was established. These demographics have started changing over the past few decades, but even in the most diverse areas of the valley the aforementioned white people make up like, at least 30% of the local populace; in most of the Valley, it‚Äôs at least 50%. As the demographics of the valley have shifted, so have the political views (there‚Äôs a reason why we were able to elect Katie Hill!), but conservative whites still make up a good chunk of the populace. Combine that with the fact many of the people in the valley, regardless of race, are affiliated with the military or other parts of the military industrial complex, you have a populace that is more conservative than most other places in California, which these days often manifests in blue lives matter flags and other such paraphernalia. (A good chunk of the population is also religious [specifically Evangelicals and Catholics, which demographically trend towards being conservative], but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs its own influence or tied in with something I already mentioned.)

"Hi! So I can‚Äôt offer guidance to all the schools, but hopefully I can help you out with a few. I lived in the AV my whole life until I went to college, so all of my friends went to school there, and both of my parents work for AVUHSD. Not super reliable, I‚Äôm aware, but hopefully first-hand experiences can help you figure out what to do. I‚Äôll list the schools and then what I know about them. 

**Highland High School (Palmdale):**

This is the one I went to for all four years, so it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm most qualified to talk about. Full disclosure, I graduated in 2016, so it‚Äôs entirely possible things have changed since then, but hopefully not too much. Academically, it‚Äôs pretty strong. They have a really good Law program and a kick-ass Mock Trial team. (I was on the team for three years, lol.) They also have a pretty robust AP and Honors program. Their language offerings are really good for the district: they offer Spanish, Latin, French, and ASL, although they only offer Honors classes for Spanish and Latin, and only offer AP classes for Spanish. The student body is pretty diverse. Most of the teachers are really nice (and also good at their jobs). They have a pretty good offering of after-school clubs. Our marching band is also really good; we regularly win or place top three in interstate competitions. They have a pretty good offering of sports teams, although from what I understand none of them are very good (except for the Wrestling and Swim teams). 

Another warning: there was an attempted mass shooting here in 2017. Thankfully no one was killed and only one person was hurt, but it was pretty traumatic to everyone there. I pray it won‚Äôt be an issue again in the future, but I wanted to leave a disclaimer. 

**Littlerock High School (Littlerock):**

This probably isn‚Äôt a contender for you, but it‚Äôs the one I know the second-most about so I thought it worth mentioning. Most of my friends went here; it‚Äôs the school I was originally zoned for, but my parents had me transferred to Highland. From what I understand, academically they aren‚Äôt that special, but they have a really good Ag and JROTC program, if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre interested in. 

**Quartz Hill High School (Quartz Hill):**

Most of my brothers went here. It‚Äôs really good academically, from what I understand; it‚Äôs the only school in the District that offers the IB program. Other than that, I can‚Äôt tell you much except that it has a reputation for being not very racially diverse, to put it lightly; to add additional context, their mascot is the Rebel, which used to be the Confederate Rebel. (Yeah.)

**Lancaster High School (Lancaster):** 

Honestly don‚Äôt know much about them, but I know they have a Biomedical academy and Engineering academy that‚Äôs supposed to be really good. 

**Palmdale High School (Palmdale):** 

Not the worst, not the best. Beautiful, huge campus that‚Äôs been around since the 50s(? or somewhere along those lines). Really good greenhouse and agricultural classes, really good auto shop and automotive classes. Also have a really good robotics team, last I heard. (I think they won an international competition a few years ago? My memory is a little sketchy.) Also a really good marching band. 

**Eastside High School (Lancaster):**

Hands-down one of the most beautiful high school campuses I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs meant to look like a college, and it succeeds. Most large district events are held there (often in their theater) specifically because of how nice it is. They also have a Biomedical Science Program. That being said, it doesn‚Äôt have the best reputation, but I don‚Äôt necessarily buy that. Lancaster and Palmdale historically are/were rife with redlining (there was a lawsuit about it as recently as 2011), and so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all if most (or all) of Eastside‚Äôs bad reputation stemmed from racism. 

**Pete Knight High School (Palmdale)** 

I hate the man it‚Äôs named after, but the school itself is pretty good. I don‚Äôt think it offers much academically that other schools in the district don‚Äôt offer, but please feel free to double-check that. From what I‚Äôve heard, the kids and teachers are nice. 

**SOAR Academy (Lancaster):**

So I don‚Äôt know if this is technically part of the AVUHSD, but I thought it was worth mentioning. It‚Äôs housed on the AVC campus (our local community college), and students there take a combination of college and high school classes. It‚Äôs an extension of AVID, so it‚Äôs designed for people who plan to go to college but are the first in their families to do so. It does incredibly well academically, and everything I‚Äôve heard about it is positive. You do have to apply to get in, but if it sounds right for you and you want to, I think it would be worth it. The students there go to school for five years and graduate with a Diploma and an Associate‚Äôs Degree. 

That‚Äôs about it for what I know of the high schools, but speaking of AVC, if your child(ren) is/are academically advanced there‚Äôs a really cool program there that lets them take classes for high school credit. I took an English and Math course there my senior year of high school to get out of taking what the school offered (I tested out of the highest English option Highland had, which is AP Lit) and it worked wonderfully for me. 

As for transfers to and from schools, from what I understand it is possible but it‚Äôs incredibly difficult if someone your child is related to doesn‚Äôt work for the school district. Based on what I‚Äôve heard, your best bet to make sure your kid ends up at a specific school is to move within the boundaries for that school.

Please let me know if you have any more questions! I hope this helps, and good luck in the AV :)",t2_9zvhfgmb,lesbiantolstoy,0,1617091133.0,0,t1_gss2fcb,gss2fcb,True,N4922P,t3_mg96so,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmdale/comments/mg96so/local_schools/,Local schools?,/r/palmdale/comments/mg96so/local_schools/gss2fcb/,9,r/palmdale,1,9

"I think the reasoning why this area specifically has higher percentage of people without a degree is that L.A. county ships those in poverty over here for housing opportunities. Rent is cheaper in the valley. Those in poverty don't usually have a degree, but let me say this, your financial status and whether you have a degree or not does not say anything about one's IQ, critical thinking, manners, common courtesy, , common sense, morals, or anything else for that matter.

Statistics and numbers you can follow them if you like but I have lived in The Valley, Los Angeles County, even more ritzy neighborhoods like Sherman oaks and none of them have been cleaner, quieter, and peaceful than Palmdale.

Everyone I have seen picks up their dog poop don't see a whole lot of littering, they are courteous with social distancing safety measurements, nobody bothers anybody, I rarely see graffiti, or homeless, everybody minds their business.

"Two possibilities: the first is street view type imaging. Google is famous for branding the cars they use for this, but nothing says they have to. People like to clown for those cameras so there's incentive to not brand the cars. Or it's another service than google.

Other possibility is third-party license plate scanning. A company drives around scanning license plates all day. For law enforcement, this is a legal gray area since they're ""investigating"" everyone without a crime having taken place necessarily. For a private company, however...

"Lived in Lancaster for a few years, moved to El Monte, then up into Palmdale (going on 4 years).

Entertainment - Non-existent. A handful of movie theaters, bars, etc. I feel for the 20 somethings (brother in law), because other than work and school, there‚Äôs really nothing for him to do out here.

Shopping - We have all the typical large chains. Target, Walmart, Costco, Grocery stores. For whatever else, Amazon is your best friend. AV mall is your run of the mill smallish center.

Vehicle repairs - Tons of mechanics, no need me to worry. A few car dealerships as well, with all the major brands.

Dining - Quite a lot of restaurants. Everything from Cuban, to Ramen, to Vietnamese, and of course American faire. FB has a group ‚ÄúAV Restaurant Support‚Äù where people contribute AV finds. If you know where to look, there are quite a few places to get a good dinner experience.

Environment - As we are in the high desert, we experience more changes in tempter tire than they do in Los Angeles. Summers can reach 108+, while sun freezing temperatures during winter are no my uncommon. The air is dry, so if you are sensitive to that, use a humidifier. High winds whip through the area, and can carry Valley Fever. It‚Äôs not common, but it happens.
If you can, get a place with Solar panels, it‚Äôll save your wallet during summer. The water quality isn‚Äôt the best, so I recommend an RO filtration system for drinking water.

Crime - Vehicular burglary is a constant. Lock your cars at night, and don‚Äôt leave anything valuable visible. The bad element heads into more affluent areas all the time. Porch thieves are prevalent, but no more than other places I presume. You‚Äôll want a Ring camera. Catalytic converter theft is common.
Reports of armed robbery are frequent, but given the population density, its probably average frequency.

"Sure, so when you park at that viewpoint, you have to go on the dirt side of the aquaduct, which you can go across the bridge to get there. Then you go until you see a gulley next to you, and you'll know you've reached the right place if you see a huge tunnel going under the aquaduct. Here's a picture https://i.imgur.com/4R5AVS4.jpg

But I will say that this trail entrance, along with several other trails in the Joshua Ranch area, are moreso intermediate, so I wouldn't take children using this specific entrance. But if you come in from P-12, there's a smooth, slowly climbing paved road all the way to where they are building houses, and you should just be able to take whichever path seems nicest to you. But again, would def reccomend a map since it can get confusing. I can't really explain which specific trails to go on, since it's really something you gotta explore and find out! But that link I posted in my previous reply gives a good reference. 

And yes, there's a couple of people on bikes, but it depends on the trail you're on- some are the ""regular"" bike trails, which are kinda hard to escape from bikes since they're only narrow enough for one bike, while others are a lot more wider. 

And many people take their families on the aquaduct, although I will warn that the very wide asphalt road has steep slopes on either sides without rails. On one side, it goes to the aquaduct, while on the other, it's a relatively steep hillside. Here's a picture I took semi-recently https://i.imgur.com/AYkQjzG.jpg

But a definite family-friendly ""hike"" (moreso a walk) is the one in the Prime Desert Woodlands Preserve https://i.imgur.com/kbYupgI.jpg.  It's about 3 miles of cordoned off trails, it's a nice ~1 hour walk, including informational signs explaining the foliage and history of the AV. Too bad the visitor center is closed due to the pandemic, but the trails seem to be fine. You can even stop by the nearby park (but I remembered that parks are closed off now, but maybe sometime in the future).",t2_ei1dz,Sir_Awesome_The_3rd,0,1607466433.0,0,t1_gf3om6u,gf3om6u,False,QuailGlass957,t3_k6xg0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmdale/comments/k6xg0k/how_is_the_nature_and_local_hikingwalking_near/,"How is the ""nature"" and local hiking/walking near Rancho Vista and Quartz Hill?",/r/palmdale/comments/k6xg0k/how_is_the_nature_and_local_hikingwalking_near/gf3om6u/,1,r/palmdale,0,1

It was in the San Gabriel mtns and seemed like we were on a trail.  He chased us up a very steep hill and said we couldn't just turn back around and he saw a pregnant woman make it up the hill.

I love walking or biking along the aqueduct in Palmdale and QH. I start at the aqueduct behind highland. Here in Palmdale along the aqueduct you can see nearly the whole valley sprawled out past the court house and beyond. The farther you go towards quartz hill you start to see the mountains better and you can see out towards Tehachapi and you can see wind mills. Spring of course is always the best for nature.

"Yes, Joshua Ranch is a great area for hiking and biking, I take out my mountain bike there all the time. So many different trails criss-crossing everywhere, but conversely there's a potential to get lost in them, so bring a phone with a map. 

Here's a trail showcasing the area. 
https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/ritter-ridge-joshua-ranch

You can park at W P-12 I think. 
Or you can park at the Lookout on Godde Hill Road, and take a nice walk along the aquaduct- very nice views of the whole valley! (There's also a way to get into the trail system from this way, but you have to take the dirt road on the right hand side of the aquaduct. If you'd like more info about it I can share.) 

Also, just today I was out hiking near the Ana Verde Valley, it's definitely a lot more strenuous if you're looking for big climbs. You can park on the cul-de-sac of Carolyn Drive for a nice concrete pathway up to the trail.

"Realtor here.  Welcome to the market.  It's bad out there.  About 1/3 the inventory there was last year, prices through the roof, offers well over list.  Places are selling but only to those with the most money.

How much do you have to put down, percentage-wise, I mean?  Nobody's saying it's impossible to get a place with 3, 5, 10 or even 20% down but the more your down, the better your offer.  Who's your approval from, a commercial bank, credit union or mortgage lender?  God forbid it's one of those online outfits, your offer is nearly worthless.  Direct lender is best.  

Even if you do everything right, in this market, there's almost always going to be someone with more money and a better offer.  

fwiw, when I bought my first house, I'd put in ten offers, all rejected.  Don't give up.  Don't  let your agent give up on you.  If they do, just get another one.
