"Hi there. My name is Hannah Patterson. I am an occupational therapist and a doctorate student at Columbia University. I am currently seeking participants for my research study looking at the effects of a caregiver training program for caregivers of  recovering Covid-19 survivors on caregiver burden. The aim of this study is to give caregiver's tools to reduce stress and burden.

The participant could even be an informal care giver such as a spouse or child.   
The study will run for 6 weeks, for 45 minutes once a week and will be held on Zoom. Please contact me if you or a loved one is interested in participating in this study.

  
Thank you in advanced!

"Good luck with your interview! I worked at Freeman Jewelers for ten years. Security was sometimes an issue. My car was burglarized while I worked and the best a guard could suggest was, ""Park under the cameras."" when parking was already bad because of the holidays. The store was burglarized, too, but unlike a robbing, no one was hurt. Besides that, it came with regular 'mall' expectations. As I understand, the hours have been cut significantly so there's no more 6am-12am during December. You'll have it made! I miss my job there, actually. It was very fun.

>Don’t be a bully.

This is calling out bully's when you see them.. just like you're trying to do. And you're against it. Karens are adult Bullys you think they're better, and always right ""Customer is always right"" bullshit and need to get into everyones business... you know.. what you're doing.

"I am a graduate of the Southern Lehigh SD, early 1970s. The district (Coopersburg and Center Valley zip codes) was in transition from a farming  to a suburban commuter (Mack, Steel, Western Electric) economy. It was conservative and was not very welcoming to outsiders. Good school district, dedicated teachers, bikes, front lawns, septic systems, etc. 

Today farming is gone, sewer system prevents septic issues, the “unnamed tributary to Saucon Creek” is clean, and Main Street in Coopersburg is charming. It is still a fundamentally conservative area, though the flavor of conservatism has been refined by a high level of education. The proof, as noted by an earlier post, is in the composition of the school board. My sense is that the area is as conservative as the townships north of the three cities. The difference is that the level of education of voters and property owners in Coopersburg is quite high. It’s a great place to Iive if you fit in.

"""Coopersburg"" can refer to Coopersburg borough, parts of Upper Saucon Township, parts of Lower Milford Township, and parts of Springfield township.

In the Townships you will find varying levels of walkability (some areas have no sidewalks and you will be walking in the street itself), varying levels of property upkeep, etc. depending on whether you are on a main road not in a large subdivision, within an older/newer/lower end/high end subdivision, etc. You will find everything from townhouses packed in like sardines to multi-million dollar mansions on acreage.

Not because you're right, but because you just made me realize I left my headlights on! They have an auto setting, but didn't automatically come on this morning because it was too bright. So I had to manually turn them on because it was so foggy. I rarely have to change it from ""Auto"", so it's easy to forget when I manually turn them on.

"I think ABE is about the same. I don't fly much, but always try to use the airport so they don't drop any more carriers or flights. I live real close, too, so get a ride and that saves money on parking. We used to take TransBridge to Newark but since Covid their trips are less frequent and MUCH more expensive. It's often cheaper to take the ""United Bus"" out of ABE to Newark. I have to agree that almost all the time you breeze right through everything at ABE. That one time you get behind some people flying international with 300lbs of bags is when you're running late (happened to me at ABE). Also, TSA used to be super fast with almost nobody in line. Now there are lines most of the time, but pretty short. I avoid Philly. It is the WORST airport for delays. Fact, due to flight pattern. Any weather of any kind and ATC increases spacing on planes and everything slows down a half hour almost instantly. This was explained to me when I sat next to a pilot once. Newark is...well...Newark. Lots of flights but we've nearly missed the United Bus connection while sitting on the runway waiting for our gate to clear for almost 90 minutes. I remember way back when it was empty and they advertised it as an alternative to the other NY airports. ABE is great.

"It's all in person for the moving permit.

If you're moving into the city from outside the city, you don't need one. I got one for moving out of the city last year since it's technically required for it, but nobody checked it. I wanted to get one in case the police department wanted to see it when I requested a parking meter bag for parking the Uhaul I rented for moving out. I do highly recommend getting a parking meter bag if you're moving into/out of downtown to get a spot in front of where you're moving into. This you can get at the police station on 4th St for $15/day and you just need the park mobile ID of the parking meter. 

If you want to do it by the book to get a moving permit, fill out [this form](https://www.easton-pa.com/sites/g/files/vyhlif3076/f/uploads/movingpermitfillable.pdf#:~:text=Moving%20Permits%20are%20required%20to,the%20issuing%20of%20this%20permit.) out, then go to the Finance Department in the 2nd floor of city hall at 123 S 3rd St and they'll take care of it there and charge you.",t2_6u6dz,thetonyk123,0,1646927387.0,0,t1_i04a5v6,i04a5v6,True,[deleted],t3_t8zq1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/lehighvalley/comments/t8zq1g/does_easton_enforce_the_movingpermit_theres_a/,does Easton enforce the ‘moving-permit’ ? there’s a form but it says no paper after 2/28. there’s no option to submit electronically. and calling them is a nightmare. endless transfers and attitude problems.,/r/lehighvalley/comments/t8zq1g/does_easton_enforce_the_movingpermit_theres_a/i04a5v6/,1,r/lehighvalley,0,1

"Great for kids. A little cookie cutter for my taste, but my kid is in college and I put her through Southern Lehigh, which is in danger now due to a right wing shift at the school board (a lot of good teachers are leaving.)

"Good safe area. I remember the first homes were built around 2006 and were pretty decent in terms of features/finishes, then when the market crashed they made them cheaper/junkier looking, like the vinyl siding was wavy looking when new and instead of decks they just nailed a piece of railing over the back sliding door. There was a builder called TH Properties that also built a lot of homes in that development and ended up going bankrupt in the wake of the market crash.


The development was open farm fields before it was built, so even though probably 14-15 years have passed since the first homes were built, there isn't much of anything in terms of shade or privacy between the homes.

"I know what you mean on the lack of wild nature spaces, that is a huge issue in Lancaster because the region is so heavily developed either with city, suburb, or farmland. I'm from Lancaster, so I know that area much better.

Lancaster city is quite wonderful in a lot of ways, although it has become more expensive lately with the influx of people moving out from NYC, telecommuting, etc. I very much like the west end of the city. There are places you can live where there are a lot of trees, and you can walk to lots of cafes, restaurants, bars, drug stores, and you can also walk downtown to the central market and various shops in the downtown. The area around Franklin and Marshall college is pretty nice but close enough to the downtown to walk there.

In terms of nature, there is the county park which is kinda southeast of the downtown and there are a few smaller, rather fragmented and degraded pieces of wild forest kinda on the west end of the city, but besides that you need to drive to find nature areas. There are some really beautiful and striking ravines and rugged terrain along the Susquehanna river, Chickies Rock between Marietta and Columbia, and then a lot of stuff farther south in southern Lancaster county along the river. The northern part of the county also has this huge ridge with large unbroken tracks of forest, good hiking. And there are a few pockets of hilly, wooded areas in the kinda south-central to eastern parts of the county, but that's pretty much it, most of the rest of the county is all farm with an (unhealthy) dose of suburb.

As for the Lehigh Valley area, if you decide to go more up that way, so far my favorite part of it is Bethlehem. A lot of people in this thread recommended me to look at the west end of Allentown, but I found it lacked the sort of organic distribution of businesses that was necessary to make it walkable, like it was too much 100% residential stuff spreading out for miles, and the businesses were too concentrated in a small area in/near the theater district. I can't do that. Bethlehem though has both a nice downtown and south Bethlehem was kinda cool, and both had more of the sort of mix of businesses and residential in neighborhoods with walkable, tree-lined streets that I like. South Bethlehem has that ridge right there too, and then there is that small trail along the river, so it seemed to offer more nature stuff nearby. Plus there was a sichuan restaurant that was not bad, and that is always a plus for me!!!

This all may be a moot point because it's going to depend on what happens with my girlfriend's job offers which we are still hearing back from, we were just doing some preliminary looking and the big part of it was to see ""Do we like this area?"" to guide whether or not she wanted to apply to / accept certain positions over others.

> Philly was not it for me. The townships around are maybes but not particularly thrilling ideas as a single 30s woman. 

I also have lived in Philly. I lived in West Philly which was I think the best match for me in the city limits but it still was a bit much for me. Outside of Philly there were some areas that I liked, but nothing really felt ideal to me. I like the area around Ardmore but much of the main line bit too upscale / old money for me. I like Jenkintown and Cheltenham township, but much of the nothern suburbs are very generic suburban. Jenkintown had a nice small town vibe and was super walkable, but it lacked much racial / ethnic diversity, and especially as you go north of there into Abington township, there is palpable racism and I just didn't like the general attitude people have, like I felt like they liked cars and box stores.

The only other place I really like in the Philly metro area is on the NJ side, Collingswood, which I love and would live in if I ever needed to live over on the NJ side like if I had a job over that way or something.

"Welcome to Lehigh Valley!  

Huh, we moved from Texas to Allentown a couple of years ago.  We miss Texas.  We cried the first time we had Mexican food here—we lived in El Paso (UT, awesome city) so you can’t really beat it.  Then again pizza and cheese steaks were mostly terrible there.

I’m native to New England (we met in NC but she’s from here) but lived all over the country, so this is my POV: 

West End of Allentown might be good, Rodale tracks and hiking paths are on the west side.  Check out Rodale track, buts it’s just a big over loop.

Bethlehem is in the news quite a bit but there’s also nice parts.  Not bad if you don’t mind the drive into Allentown.  Steel Stacks has stuff going on often.  Temple University has some sort of medical school in Bethlehem, might be good place to meet others if like mindedness.

"Allentown isn't the worst city in the state; but no, it's not great. It has the higher crime rate in the area, and is pretty run down. Covid made it worse. On top of that it's a city of narrower one-way roads, and for whatever reason people in the city love to double-park. Bethlehem is next to Allentown and is significantly better. Southside Bethlehem used to be a little rough, but the city has done a really good job at cleaning it up. There's a historic district, solid bars, and a sweet local venue (look up the steel stacks). Also Easton is pretty nice as well. It's down Route 22 from Allentwon (about 30-45 minute depending on traffic), and if you've gotten a job with LVHN (one of the two main health networks in the area) 22 will bring you to most of their facilities.

It was Jam Packed last time we visited. A must-try. They really know what they're doing with their sauces and condiments. On the flip side, if your parents don't like some spice in their food then this wouldn't be a great place.",t2_dkjw2,emperorvinayak,0,1645696033.0,0,t1_hy80876,hy80876,True,Macronaut,t3_szi832,https://www.reddit.com/r/lehighvalley/comments/szi832/what_restaurant_in_the_lehigh_valley_has/,What restaurant in the Lehigh Valley has impressed you the most?,/r/lehighvalley/comments/szi832/what_restaurant_in_the_lehigh_valley_has/hy80876/,3,r/lehighvalley,0,3

"This maybe isn't special enough for a 60th anniversary but I want to pass it along to keep in your back pocket. 

Everyone knows that Bolete is the dominant high-end dining experience in the Lehigh Valley. But where does Bolete source their farm-to-table? One of their suppliers is a place at the base of the Appalachian Mountains near my house (Northwestern Lehigh SD) called *Kreeky Tree Farm*. 

It's a couple, one a professionally-trained chef, who own a 7 acre farm and do the entire farming, growing, and cooking process themselves. It's where Bolete gets their chicken and boutique eggs, among other things. 

I have gone there several times over the past year as they run scratch-made specials and have ready-to-heat meals like fried chicken and quiches. Each item of theirs I've eaten has been *phenomenal*, and I was able to give my wife some special dining experiences even with COVID take-out thanks to them.

"Congrats to them, that’s amazing!  Understanding their level of food adventure might help.

Disclaimer: Married into the area and am a transplant, eaten in countries all over much of the world and not much cuisine scares me…except boiled okra.  Been to a few places around LV and I don’t let one bad or good experience shape my opinion.  I prefer a dive with good food over ambiance, but here’s my list—

Sahara Mediterranean Cuisine - great food and service 
5661 Hamilton Blvd, Allentown, PA 18106
The owner goes above and beyond every time we dine in.  Very generous portions also.  May want to call ahead and let them know, I’m sure the owner will probably go above and beyond.

Social Still - good food and younger and energetic patrons, almost has that Quebec City restaurant vibe.  Call for reservations.

The Bayou - mixed experience and food results. 

Bolete - unpopular opinion but it’s not for me, many people like it.

Black Forest Deli - fantastic food, not much for ambiance.  Really nice people.  Time to drop in again soon!

"The following information applies to anyone looking to rent, I am a professional Property Manager and here is an inside look at what happens when you call about an apartment.

Only use the phone to find availability and make an appointment to see that apt. Serious (good tenants) are more interested in the apt than the process. No good tenant will rent a place over the phone, that's what bad tenants try to do. Property Managers are very hip to this, and you'll start out with two strikes before they even learn your name. Also if you call at the end/first of the month and want to move in right away, they will think you are skipping out on your current landlord, not good!!

Credit reports and background checks are expensive to a Landlord. I always say, ""I'll be doing a credit check and criminal background check- UNLESS you tell me not to."" We never actually do, it's too expensive over the long term. People spill their guts and disqualify themselves because I pause and smile before I say unless you ask me not to.....(much to my displeasure because I really want you to be the newest tenant)... I make no money for denying you so I will find a way to spin whatever you tell me, if a way exists.

The only real non-starters are:

• Civil judgments filed against you for non-payment of rent.

• A need to notify the neighborhood type charges (Megan's Law)

• Drug dealer or physical violence convictions in the last 10 years.

They will most likely google your name, and check social medias, so if you got old pics of you smoking a Cheech & Chong jumbo, or posing with your AR-15 like you're Rambo in First Blood- get them off of there. Bottom line make sure all your stuff is private.

Renting differs from State to State but the most common thing a Landlord is looking for, first and foremost, is the ability to pay rent. Good general rule of thumb for any housing expense is to be able to demonstrate a verifiable income source. If the rent is 1000 a month you must make at least 500 a week gross (before deductions) to qualify.

They won't expect you to have great credit, you're not trying to buy the place and they know that. If your credit was any better you wouldn't be renting.

When they ask when are you looking to move in, always say the 1st of the next month. Normal (good) tenants don't move in the same day, or wait to the last minute when they have to leave their previous place. Whether you need to or not, say you want to give proper notice to your current Landlord. Again only deadbeats don't give notice.

This is very important- ASK FOR A DISCOUNT OR SPECIAL. Some Landlords will list a much higher rent so they can offer a good tenant/prospect better rates. Good tenants always ask, most bad tenants don't. Also, don't offer to pay any more than 1st month/SD/Last month up front. Only drug dealers do that. They'll offer 6 months up front because they don't want you knocking on the door and the apt is for somebody else entirely.

Never pay an application fee until you see the ACTUAL unit you're going to be renting. Be a little suspect if you're looking at a pristine new model apt. Whatever they give you will never be as clean and nice as the model.

Lastly, Don't give your landlady the house-man blues....

I come home one Friday... Had to tell the landlady I'da lost my job.... She said that don't befront me..... Long as I get my money next Friday...... Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent .......And out the door I went!!

I just had my cabinets painted in December by J Poplar (484-221-2240). Jason did a great job. He took the doors off and worked on them at his shop. Then he came to my home and painted the cabinets. He is professional and very neat. He really taped everything up carefully and tented the kitchen off because I live in condo and my downstairs is all one room.

I'm tired of the mindset that we need to sell ourselves short for ""opportunities"" when it doesn't have to be that way. Of course people care about money bc you can't live in this country without it. At least not comfortably. Most people know life is about more than money, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't worry about it. And if that's the case, then why not spare some money to pay these people?

I think user below blocked me so I cant directly reply. Here is my response to their statement: 

A college credit can be worth thousands of dollars…

Yea but only doing activities that are worth a certain $ per hour will keep you in that range. If someone wanted to take the time to pursue this role they would most likely come out of it being able to earn a higher $ per hour overall. I know you aren’t getting instant gratification of $ in your pocket right away but if you put it on the value scale of the jobs for young adults out of HS, it is usually higher. You will exit this internship being able to competitively ask for more money. 

I think growth opportunities like these, aren’t meant for individuals with your mindset, which is fine.
