">when you say ~20% is caused by transportation, you're neglecting to mention that that figure also includes airplanes and shipping

Transportation is responsible for 29% of emissions, and of that 29, 58% is caused by light-duty motor vehicles on land. 58% of 29% = 16.82% of emissions are caused by small vehicles. If you include medium- and large-duty vehicles, the percentage goes up to 24% of all emissions are caused by motor vehicles on land. I cannot find statistics that only include light- and medium-duty, though I suspect that it would be around 20%.

Airplanes are responsible for 2.9% of all emissions, with ships and boats accounting for 0.58%. 

All statistics listed only apply to ""United States""  emissions. It may be that the boat and plane statistics are skewed due to the amount of time that they operate in international airspace or waters, though I cannot say how much at this time, or if the statistics actually account for this after all. https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions

I do know that, globally, ocean-faring boats account for 3% of all emissions.


>It would be amazing if we had better public transportation up here, but until we do people are going to have to drive.

As sad as it is, the public transit infrastructure won't ever be here until people start generating a demand for it. It's a fucked up chicken-and-egg kind of thing.

Additionally, the more people that use privately owned cars, the more cash that the morons in Sacramento and on County supervisory boards will dedicate to the roads, instead of where it should be going: to building decent public transit infrastructure.

"Welcome!!

I see Trinidad is on your list and I highly recommend it. Trinidad Head is a nice beautiful walk. And I recommend the food (especially ice cream) at Lighthouse Grill!

I'd also suggest driving along the Peninsula: From Arcata take the 255 towards Samoa/Manila. Once you get to Manila you can go to the Dunes there: If you Google Ma-le'l Dunes it'll take you by the gun club and there are a few nice spots out that direction. If you keep heading past Manila you'll end up driving by Samoa Beach (the town of Samoa is actually super tiny and only has the Samoa Cookhouse to eat at). Samoa Beach is a good spot, but honestly, you can continue to drive south all the way to the North Jetty and check out any of the beaches along that way. A very popular beach to watch the sunset out this direction is on Bay st (turn right on Bay St and it has a small parking lot by the beach).

If you're staying in Arcata and want a relaxing lunch time spot I would suggest picking up food then heading to the Community Forest to just have a nice picnic at the park there. It's a big field and you can enjoy the sunshine and throw the Frisbee around while you people watch the locals. Then you can explore the trails that are right there next to HSU.

One of my other favorite spots honestly is Ferndale: I love to hike Russ Park (it's not actually a park, but a trail lol) and Centerville Beach is nice.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't say tacos are really a hot commodity in this area =\  But for food I will highly recommend McIntosh Farm Country Store. They have yummy breakfast and lunch and their donuts are hella good!

I'm also not very helpful when it comes to breweries, but for a date night in Arcata I would recommend Slice of Humboldt Pie. They have a multitude of ciders on tap (I'm personally more of a cider person than a beer person) and they also have delicious pie and empanadas. A short walk from Slice of Humboldt Pie is Cafe Mokka. I've seen some others on here recommend it and I second that choice. It's a small little coffee shop that is, without doubt, my favorite little place in Humboldt. It's a great spot to just sip on a coffee (or in my case, hot chocolate with lots of whip cream!!!) and take a moment to breathe. They also have hot tubs that you can take a soak in and I find to be very relaxing. I would recommend going in the evening when it's a bit chilly out and you can really enjoy the warmth and quiet of the hot tubs. It's like taking a trip to a whole other world.

If you're in town over the weekend something else I'd recommend checking out is the Arcata Farmers Market. It's on Saturday mornings at the Plaza (the center of town) and I always recommend the Farmers Market to people visiting so they can just feel the community of Arcata and see the people. Something about it feels really welcoming to me and you can walk around and get some fresh fruit or a little food and just enjoy yourself.

Hopefully this helps! I absolutely love Arcata and Humboldt and all I can say is that no matter what you choose to do you can't go wrong because there is soooo much to visit and see!",t2_g7vu3,Barkingcat29,0,1647556530.0,0,t1_i12wdir,i12wdir,True,Hairydrunk,t3_tf354e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/tf354e/vacation_stops_checklist/,Vacation stops checklist,/r/Humboldt/comments/tf354e/vacation_stops_checklist/i12wdir/,2,r/Humboldt,0,2

"Have a used car checked out by a mechanic of your choosing. A dealership worth anything will let you do this. Find out what repairs are really needed.

Instead of coming down in price, you may find that, oh, huh, the dealership then wants to make the situation right by having its own mechanic do the repairs prior to purchase. If you do that, I'd have your chosen mechanic inspect the vehicle again afterward.  Don't tell your chosen mechanic what dealership you are buying from. If you're especially suspicious, have a different mechanic do the re-inspection, because you'll have had to divulge the first mechanic you used when you show the dealership the repair estimate.

Don't let the dealership BS you on price, either. My first used car negotiation involved settling on a price with the salesman, sitting down at his desk, and waiting for him to come back with the papers. Huh, he's taking a long time. Then the dealership owner comes out and says he can't sell the car at that price, I have to leave some meat on the bone, looking at me expecting I'm going to agree. They broke a verbal agreement on the price. I walked out. 

A few weeks later the dealership was in the news for an employee selling drugs out of the car lot. That's unrelated, but yeah, I hate dealing with car dealerships.

For my next car, I went through Costco's new car auto program which provides an up-front set price. Once at the dealership, just say no to all the expensive extras they want to pile on like an extended warranty for the car electronics.

Car rental companies also have annual sales of their fleet. They don't want to deal with repairs. I think they sell cars after the first year.

"Walk around Arcata - there are five dispensaries within short walking distance of the Plaza (Humboldt Patient Resource Center, The Heart of Humboldt, Pacific Paradise, The Fireplace, Herb & Market). I’m probably even missing some. 

Papa & Barkley is a cannabiz that manufactures their own product to sell and also has a storefront and smoking lounge in Eureka. It’s on Broadway, on the south end of town. 

Brio and Big Blue on the Plaza have good coffee and breakfasts (Brio is more bougie). Ramone’s is my favorite for coffee and they have a couple locations, one of them inside Wildberries which is a supermarket up the hill from the Plaza. 

As far as breweries go, I agree with what everyone else recommended but I am also throwing Mad River Brewery into the ring. It was recently bought by the Yurok tribe and is located in a teeny town called Blue Lake in the valley about ten minutes inland on 299.

>Endert Beach 

>Clam Beach

>Samoa Dunes

Not those destinations. Clam Beach is exceptionally uninteresting, unless your love a standard flat featureless beach that has almost no clams (unlike in the past). The beach I would visit is Luffenholtz Beach in Trinidad.  Everyone has their own favorite beaches in Trinidad though.

Trinidad State Beach is okay, particularly the part at the end of Edwards Street in town. To the east is Trinidad Pier, and in between it is Trinidad Head which has a nice trail around the head with oceans views. You may catch a peek of the original Trinidad Lighthouse on the head, now open only during occasional tours during the summer. It's a super small lighthouse.

Sue-meg State Park is a good visit (formerly called Patrick's Point State Park, named after a murderous asshole... California is in the process of reconciling its place names with history). Sue-meg Village is found there, a recreation of a Yurok village. The tribe, California's largest, uses the village for some ceremonies and events. I was invited to a [flower dance](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/the-flower-dancers/Content?oid=10229320) there.  You're also likely to meet one or two Yurok park rangers in North Coast parks. For me, they are like local celebrities, having listened and watched their live streams during shelter-in-place educating people about the parks. There are a number of beaches and viewpoints at Sue-meg... Wedding Rock, Agate Beach, etc.

"A security deposit goes to the landlord, and gets paid back when the tenant moves out, unless there is a legitimate reason for the landlord to keep a portion of the deposit.

A new renter giving a $1,000 security deposit to a tenant who is moving out not only makes no sense, it is kissing $1,000 goodbye.

If multiple roommates signed a lease, the security deposit stays with the lease until the last roommate moves out. Yes, that kind of sucks for roommates who leave earlier than other roommates.

"I’m sure you’re familiar, but as one of the greats said:  Happiness does not dwell in flocks of cattle or in gold. Happiness, like unhappiness, is a property of the soul. And it is right that men should value the soul rather than the body; for perfection of soul corrects the inferiority of the body, but physical strength without intelligence does nothing to improve the mind. Men find happiness neither by means of the body nor through possessions, but through uprightness and wisdom.

"When I lived there 2004-2017.  There was a lot of great food from crafty type kitchens and food trucks/tents at the events.  I'm sure if you look around and ask you'll make some great finds

I loved the Korean taco truck in Arcata

Chicken flutas at the speedy taco truck in Mac (not much else there)...  

There was a great sushi place in eureka (Kyoto?)

Brick and fire in eureka was awesome

The little organic cafe in Ferndale

Renata's crepes in arcata

La trattoria in Arcata

AA in eureka surprisingly had great steaks

Folie Douce in Arcata depending on the owner at the time.

Not sure what's still there and not anymore.  And no it won't ever rival a large City.  I'm definitely forgetting some others In this short list.  But I miss my favorite food up there for sure.

"I see some people have said they’re concerned about you being able to afford to live here, BUT if you’ll be working for someone like Cooperation Humboldt, Arcata House Partnership, CUNA, or Food for People then they actually pay pretty decent ($25/hr is typically what I see when I look on Indeed).  

I’ll be honest, unless you’re going into one of those or do GIS, IT, or work in some type of natural resources or botany, there’s not many “career” type jobs here.  I still see a lot of people moving here from the Midwest thinking they can make it big in the cannabis industry, and that’s just not true.  I have a degree and was doing well for a while, but I hit the glass ceiling and need to move in order to get paid more.  People here typically don’t like to pay you what you’re worth, and because there’s very limited opportunities up here it sometimes feels like you have to settle.  If you’re trying to live somewhere near the “city”, I’d recommend Eureka or Mckinleyville.  Arcata housing is typically overpriced and has mold problems, and usually broken heaters.  A lot of slumlords think they can get away with charging high prices for a really crappy place.  Also hardly anyone accepts pets, so you’ll either have to get really lucky or lie.  Also, AVOID renting or buying from a business called California Lifestyles Realty.  They’re a bunch of snakes and everyone I’ve known who have rented from them (myself included) have had a terrible experience.  A lot of their rentals are health hazards.

Taxes are really high in CA.  If you move here, I highly recommend asking your employer to withhold extra money from each paycheck (like $30) to avoid owing.  I always prefer to live on a little less each month rather than find out I owe money come tax season.  On top of that, your monthly utility expenses will be around $200 unless you can find a place that includes some.  

Public Transportation is basically nonexistent here, I highly recommend coming with a vehicle.  Also healthcare and dental is insanely hard up here, no one is ever taking new patients.  I’ve lived here for 8 years and I still don’t have a dentist unless I want to drive 3 hours to Redding.

Not trying to bum you out, just trying to give you realistic expectations!  I wish someone had told me all this before I moved here so I could have been better prepared.  We all kind of think of Humboldt County as an island; far away from everything, so everything is inherently a little more expensive.  Also, HSU just became a Poly so I’m sure rent is about to increase again.",t2_6cpthkcb,PotentialCalm,0,1646951984.0,0,t1_i060zr1,i060zr1,True,Murky_Ad7744,t3_tb3r36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/tb3r36/arkansas_to_eureka/,Arkansas to Eureka,/r/Humboldt/comments/tb3r36/arkansas_to_eureka/i060zr1/,6,r/Humboldt,0,6

It is pretty but in all honesty the natural beauty is comparable to many other places in the PNW. You’ll pay far more in taxes than you would in coastal Oregon and coastal Washington. Gasoline is more expensive than many other parts of California. I used to direct a non profit that provided reading lessons and tutoring to homeless children in Eureka. It is rewarding work but compensation will barely cover living expenses even in a shared living situation. Methamphetamine was the major issue homeless families were dealing with when I ran that program. My understanding is that at this point there are many students and workers experiencing homelessness so you may avoid some of the heartbreak. I had a 4 year old I worked with get into her mom’s meth and overdose and it still breaks my heart whenever I think about that completely avoidable tragedy.,t2_hndy8j4c,AslanOvcharka,0,1646949370.0,0,t1_i05uimb,i05uimb,True,Murky_Ad7744,t3_tb3r36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/tb3r36/arkansas_to_eureka/,Arkansas to Eureka,/r/Humboldt/comments/tb3r36/arkansas_to_eureka/i05uimb/,8,r/Humboldt,0,8

During an oil spill response at the Marine Wildlife Care Center at the top of East 17th Street, there were volunteers parking on that road in order to carry injured and oiled seabirds in cardboard boxes to the center.

It's a campus building at the furthest border of the campus where nobody normally parks, including residents in the area.

APD went up and down that hill ticketing volunteers every day and made everyone pay. It was utterly heartless.

"How exactly? By dropping the sanctions. The sanctions are in practice against America and Europe. If the sanctions are dropped prices for all types of energy will drop dramatically for Europe and the USA. 

One of the major problems is that most world producers are not willing to increase supply at all to benefit the USA because USA has treated them all badly for many years. LNG is a submarket whose throughput is determined by the infrastructure to support it. There aren't enough LNG terminals and ships to replace supply from nat gas pipelines and oil tankers. The cost of gasoline and diesel in the USA has nothing to do with LNG. The reason natgas prices were climbing since December is the USA was taking domestic supply and giving it to Europe to make up for a loss in supply in Europe. 

My primary point stands, which is that the sanctions and associated policy decisions are the direct and obvious cause of increasing energy costs in the USA. If the USA wants to reduce those energy costs it simply has to change its policy. The President could issue a statement right now and gas prices would drop $1 by the weekend. 

The important thing to know is that the sanctions did not stop the Russian military in Ukraine. Russia has been under sanctions for many years and is not going to let more sanctions dictate its policy. They've made that very clear and they are sticking to it. Therefore in practice the sanctions serve only to harm the economy of USA and Europe. This is widely known and was discussed in all kinds of media before Russia went into Ukraine. It's also why Europe still buys natgas from Russia and declined to ban oil imports from Russia.",t2_ao9oaybm,CTL04980,0,1646875675.0,0,t1_i01txjt,i01txjt,False,FacialFlagella,t3_t94xdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/t94xdh/gas_prices_are_getting_crazy/,Gas prices are getting crazy.,/r/Humboldt/comments/t94xdh/gas_prices_are_getting_crazy/i01txjt/,1,r/Humboldt,0,1

"The inevitable student protests [will be about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Indians):

>Spanish explorers arrived on California's coasts as early as the mid-16th century. In 1769 the first Spanish Franciscan mission was built in San Diego. Local tribes were relocated and conscripted into forced labor on the mission, stretching from San Diego to San Francisco. Disease, starvation, over work and torture decimated these tribes. Many were baptized as Roman Catholics by the Franciscan missionaries at the missions. 

The entire point of the mission system, other than, essentially, slavery, was to strip Native Americans of their culture. That is what the mission architecture reflects, and Cal Poly Humboldt uses it for its welcome signs.

This mindset carried forward into California statehood where genocide was sanctioned by the state government. Go back 150 years and you have Native children taken from their families and placed into indentured servitude in white homes. Except of course when white settlers weren't outright murdering children.

"CP Humboldt will be more than doubling its on-campus housing to around 4,300 beds within 6 years. That number is pretty solid because the university is building on school-owned land and is receiving construction funding from the CSU, and it has a lot more control over such projects because the housing is on campus property.

The university would like to double its enrollment in that timeframe to 11,000 students. That figure is far less certain. I would say it's extremely optimistic. The university is in an enrollment slump. It's a big ask to expect students to travel far from home coming out of a pandemic amid economic uncertainty while having parents who may not have done so well for themselves these past few years.

That said, the City of Arcata is working on housing projects, as is the county. If CP Humboldt actually reaches 11,000 enrollment, I'm hoping more students are living outside Arcata and increased ridership of bus systems will result in public transportation services being expanded.",t2_69ixo,bookchaser,0,1646785404.0,0,t1_hzwqvme,hzwqvme,False,RapGameRufio,t3_t99p26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/t99p26/its_happening/,It’s happening,/r/Humboldt/comments/t99p26/its_happening/hzwqvme/,7,r/Humboldt,0,7

"There's nothing you can really do. They live on the streets in the cold can you really be that surprised when they steal? Nobody took care of any of these people, the only thing that ever took care of them was drugs. You shunned them, you didn't care about them, and now you are surprised when they don't care about your property and steal from you. The homeless services in this county are a band-aid covering a festering wound. Unless something is done on a federal level, this will always be an issue for our community. Most communities do not have the resources to spend on the homeless. 

On the flip side, wage theft accounts for more money stolen from the American public then all other forms of theft combined. While it sucks that homeless people are stealing your stuff, why are you so mad about that and not the potential wages that have been stolen from you by your employer. When somebody steals a million dollars from a bank, they go to jail for the rest of their life. When Walgreens steals 8 million dollars from its employees, they just have to spend 2 million on lawyers to lower it down to 6 million dollars. CEOs knew about what they were doing, and none of them spent a day in jail. Ask yourself, why is it okay for us to bail out multinational corporations who then turn around and raise prices and cut jobs, but not okay for us to spend money on the homeless problem in America. 

Unless something is done, you will always pay for it either via the things they steal from you, or the taxes that you pay to keep them housed and fed.",t2_bbi2p6x7,sol-vin,0,1646724622.0,0,t1_hzt8udi,hzt8udi,True,massage_karma,t3_t97yiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/t97yiw/thieves/,Thieves!!!!!,/r/Humboldt/comments/t97yiw/thieves/hzt8udi/,31,r/Humboldt,2,31

"Quality wise they are all the same in my opinion, but heres some other thoughts about them….

Larrupin is a beautifully decorated  restaurant; serves a traditional main/salad/potato meal. Very good app board. beer/wine only. Since its in Trinidad you can plan a beach trip then dinner. 

Salt does have excellent steaks + seafood obviously, so more choices. Full bar. Downtown Arcata so can walk around town if you want. 

Campground has the best & eclectic cocktails + i like all the options for salads and sides. Very pretty yummy salads. Full bar. Also v. good brunch! 

For example, I really like get get a variety of apps and sides, so Campground. My bf only drinks bourbon, so we don’t do Larrupin (no cocktails). 


Maybe read some reviews/menus too?
