Armstrong is who I have now, for a couple more months, they've been great imo, easy to work with, based out of Md as stated. I use my own equipment so no issues with passwords etc.

Double Dog, when there are no other options it's not terrible, but it's not great either. Seemed like you had to call every few months when service got sketchy and they go move an antenna around somewhere and it would get better again temporarily.

Hughes, I would never ever ever ever use this garbage again as long as I live. Cons - expensive equipment, slow af (like not even 5% of advertised speed), usage limits, latency issues, locked in, expensive monthly, terrible non-existent customer service. Pros - none.

Now if you're not near enough to York, depending on how far out in York County you move, your options could include:

(How do I know? I looked at a *lot* of houses over the last 3 years. Way too many.)

Armstrong (instead of Comcast) - which is worse than Comcast as you can't manage your own hardware (you can't even set your own wifi ssid / password), but I suppose they don't suck quite as much as Comcast in other ways, not sure, some friends in Stewartstown have it, there's some invisible line and on the West it's Comcast and East it's Armstrong. They're also big in NE MD

Devil Dog - some local company, line of sight / microwave-based, if you're super out in the sticks. Great until it storms and you lose line of sight. That was out at a really nice Mid-Century house near Felton

T-Mobile / AT&T / Verizon Hotspot - seriously, some houses, even some about a mile from Shrewsbury - that was their internet. No Comcast

Hughes Satellite - they kept advertising in the mail. I wouldn't bother. Nothing like a good guaranteed 550ms minimum ping time.

Roburritos is good, though I'm a bigger fan of the burritos from Mexitaly. There's a cool Mexican-style place called The Cantina downtown, it's in a district called Royal Square which has art galleries and even this dark arts occult store which is really well curated.

The Central Market on Philadelphia St is a great place find all kinds of good food, not sure about tacos, but there's a Roburritos there, a crepe place, vegan place, world cuisine, gyros and more. You'll want to go on a Tue or Sat when all of the market stands are open.

Oh, and we've got a First Fridays of the month thing where a couple streets downtown are closed down for bands, vendors, etc and all of the art galleries are open then too.

"Contrails form most when you have high humidity, because the water in the jet exhaust collects and freezes on the engine soot rather than dissipating into the air as water vapor. This collection of ice particles constitutes the contrail plume. 

York has been seeing rather high humidity (80+%), in addition to lower temperatures, which both result in higher contrail formation.

Rabbit Transit is extremely limited in where it goes and how often, but if you happen to live walking distance from a stop it can be fairly useful.  
  
When I was a freshman in college I only had a little gas motor scooter, which was insanely dangerous to drive in the snow. When the roads were bad I'd take the bus to school, which took ~15 minutes longer but was worth the safety  
  
There are also intercity buses like Greyhound, OurBus, and Chinatown buses (though many of these routes have been chopped since covid started)

You mentioned the housing cost difference.  That is simply due to the overly high cost on the west coast, coupled with York being a pocket of reasonable housing.  Come south by 45 mins in Maryland and you will get back to what you might see on the West Coast.

"Honey run is good, they just redid their pro shop. I think it is the slowest place you can play in York, On weekends they have something like 8 min between tee times. Briarwood is a pretty stock course thats well run, they also offer a five hole course for like 13 bucks with cart. I've been playing the Bridges a lot lately, they have the best practice facilities + resturant, and the couse is really interesting - lots of trees +  some water. Hickory Heights is the best cheap place to play and the course layout is really challenging, usually you can walk on. Cool creek is ok, kinda like briarwood. Heritage and Royal man are probably the 2 best around.

"Heritage Hills is a good course around the $50 range, tough to beat that track around here for the price. I can attest it's in good shape this year. Royal Manchester is up north a bit, always highly rated although I've never played it. Bridgewater Golf is a nine hole track that used to be better but is fine and is on the cheaper side from my understanding. Hickory Heights is a bit further from York, is definitely more affordable, seems less busy, certainly isn't a premium course but I've always liked it. Grandview is a solid track for York standards but can be slower pace of play from my experience unless you're playing through the week which would be fine. Briarwood Golf Club falls in the same category for me. Hope these anecdotes help but it can be hit or miss around here, hit me up with any questions. Edit: forgot about Honey Run which isn't bad at all, can be filled with slow older groups if you don't catch it right but I like the course, and it's the only driving range you can always hit off grass around here which I like",t2_eazxq,brmgp1,0,1629259116.0,0,t1_h9dfi1s,h9dfi1s,True,[deleted],t3_p6ivke,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorkpa/comments/p6ivke/public_golf_courses/,Public golf courses,/r/yorkpa/comments/p6ivke/public_golf_courses/h9dfi1s/,9,r/yorkpa,0,9

OSS is here, but it's Doctor owned and is no longer the preeminent place to go for orthopedic care since WellSpan opened their own. If you know a good PT, ask them who they recommend to do the work.

"There are a few blocks in York (Philadelphia and market street around the cross street of George) that are super walkable. There’s a farmers market and restaurants and shops. Outside of that area there is not much at all that I would consider walkable. I believe most housing sites do provide a walkability score, so you can check the exact location. 

Other areas to consider would be Lancaster (probably exactly what you are looking for, maybe too expensive) or New Cumberland (cute little town, walkable grocery store, small shops and parks, medium-low rent). If you are cool with a rough neighborhood (not sure what part of Baltimore you are from exactly) Steelton may be a good option, rents there are desperately low (think: 5 bedroom home for $800/mo) and there is small shops to walk through and it’s a quick Uber to get to big stores like Walmart.",t2_49v9nm9l,MomsSpecialFriend,0,1618021376.0,0,t1_gu03w19,gu03w19,True,Deadmanjustice,t3_mnvb92,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorkpa/comments/mnvb92/considering_moving_to_york_from_baltimore/,Considering moving to York from Baltimore?,/r/yorkpa/comments/mnvb92/considering_moving_to_york_from_baltimore/gu03w19/,8,r/yorkpa,0,8

"YCP grad here. I graduated in may of 2020 so idk how well they’re handling the on campus pandemic situation. The college itself is great in regards to being anti-racist, anti-homophobia, etc. tbh the conservative areas of York aren’t until you reach the edges of York. The city is probably the most tolerant area to be. If you’re the party type, there’s typically stuff going on at jackson street. CAB has some fun and quirky events too. Tbh I’d hold off until the pandemic is over to save on room and board, but if you’re comfortable with it I’d say go for it!

I feel like at YCP the professors actually want you to succeed and will give you all the resources and feedback to do just that. Tutoring center in the humanities building has been a godsend. I majored in CS with constellation in arts and humanities. Both departments are pretty great.

"As someone just finishing their degree there in spring of '21 I feel like I can give a pretty good view of how the college is. I've lived in York county my whole life and I've been commuting to YCP for the two years I've been attending (transfer student from CC). 

As far as education goes, I love my psych faculty and dept.. They're freaking fantastic and really care about their students. The other departments can be iffy on education and teachers though (if you want to message me I can elaborate a bit more). The school isn't the greatest overall though with their policies and stuff. They've been horrible with COVID (again, I can elaborate more if you want) to say the least. I feel like I'm getting a good education but am also ready to move on to another school for my MA. 

As far as around the school goes, YCP pretty much divides the slums of York city and ridiculously rich areas so you definitely need to be careful. We had a string of robberies last year on Jackson St. and sometimes there are shootings in York that you can hear from campus. As for conservativeness, YCP is pretty good as far as I can tell (might be biased since I'm in the psych dept though).

YCP is super liberal as I said, I am more conservative myself, but a couple of my closest friends were super involved is clubs/organizations for LGTBQ, etc. (I believe the group was called lambda.)

The school has events non-stop and its small enough that you generally know a pretty large portion of your 'class'.

I personally find the city safe but if you get involved with drug culture in the city then the city does have a dark side.  The downtown area has a central market that has great produce and great food, or it did before covid.  The nightlife scene is okay but leaves some to be desired.

"I'm a working class white dude that looks like I would hold some problematic views of society. I'm just broke and a night shifter. But regardless, far too many people over the years have felt comfortable being super racist, sexist, and homophobic around me.

But there is a luminous silver lining here: The people I interact with on a daily basis are from increasingly rural backgrounds, of lower socioeconomic status, and *are not college educated*

YCP is a great school. It's accredited by people I respect and it's not exactly cheap when compared to the opportunities offered by community college like HACC.

Those are the 3 barriers that would theoretically keep the people mentioned away from YCP and the surrounding area.

Also the shopping plaza across richland ave is perfect for a young adult and most if not all of the shops offer student discounts on already cheap services.

"Well you do know that the PA sec of state, and Gov Wolf AND the PA Attn General all broke the law in creating an unconstitutional law regarding mail-in voting.  It is 100% illegal what they did as per PA constitution AND US constitution.  It is spelled out clear as day, and there's nothing Wolf can do that will change this.  He took the power into his own hands, changed how elections were done in PA (illegal for him to do so).  If that weren't bad enough, that is only about 10-20% of the issue - the rest lies in many different processes that took place leading up to the lelction, during and during counting.  MANY MANY MANY laws were broken.  If you look at any of our previous elections where there were improprieties, on a scale of 1-20, they were 1's at most and this is a solid 20.

Lancaster is a much better county, with nicer people, a better culture, and better restaurants.

"I grew up in Michigan so I can relate. 

York is a pretty cool little town if you keep an open mind. Sounds like you're used to living in a ""high crime"" city so you probably understand those numbers mostly reflect in-group violence. I lived downtown for three years and never had an issue. If you don't mind seeing/ interacting with people with fewer means you won't have a problem.

I love the history that's right outside your doorstep when you live in York. To walk around places every day that were important to the Revolutionary War, early industrialization, Civil War and Underground Railroad is pretty rad. That's something you don't get in the Midwest.

York and all of PA is weather purgatory in the winter. It's cold and gray but lows are generally mid 30s, so when there's precipitation it's mostly rain. Usually get one big snowstorm a year. No lake effect obviously.

Yeah Lancaster has more going on but is also more expensive. York is also very accessible to Baltimore so that's nice.

There are long - standing race issues and the county has KKK types (and actual Klan) out in the open, so know that.

Not the best place, but far from the worst place in my opinion. I'd rather live in York than any bland suburban city any day.

 I live just north of York and can get to Harrisburg in no time. Lancaster is about the same amount of time, Gettysburg which of course is more historic than art is about an hour from here. 

Harrisburg also has a lot more art life than York does. They do a couple high end art shows each year, check out Kipona Festival in harrisburg you won't be disappointed.

"I don't know York well, but from what I understand there are decent areas and really bad ones.

I recently moved 20-25 minutes south of York (Shrewsbury/New Freedom area). This was a move back to PA after living in Maryland for a couple years. I soured on the crab state after a string of awful neighbors and crime/blight creeping into my building in what was a moderately nice/expensive area.

I'm loving being back in PA, but part of that is from the contrast with how nonsensical Maryland was. I wanted peace, quiet, and a boring life in which mowing the lawn is a recreational activity. There's straight-up nothing to do down here except eat at mostly bad restaurants and walk/bike the Heritage Trail. Some good farmer's markets and a great bbq place called 3 Hogs with locations in Hanover and York.

The core areas centered around I-83 sort of feel like suburbs anywhere, but it gets rural fast once you head out of town. Per our realtor, the area is kind of a mix of locals and people trying to escape Baltimore.

The neighbors were really welcoming, but then we're a white middle-aged hetero couple, so we fly under the radar even though our politics are different from the average. Not one complaint about anyone on my street, which feels like a miracle after Maryland. It's safe and dull here. It's also VERY white. Creeped me out when I first came to check into the area, but I don't think about it anymore. Except for fireworks and cars/trucks/mowers, there's no noise.

"There are 2 colleges in York. York College is a smaller private school, and Penn State has a York campus. There are also a handful of similar sized colleges in the Harrisburg and Lancaster vicinities. 

Have you lived in PA before? Liquor is sold through our state liquor stores, and only a select few are open on Sundays. 

Depending where you'll be living in York, it's about 30-45 minutes away from Penn State Hershey Medical Center and about 45-60 minutes away from the big hospitals in Baltimore, such as Johns Hopkins and University of Maryland. I went to college in inner-city Baltimore for 4 years, and I would highly recommend avoiding Baltimore at all costs. We're also about 90-120 minutes from Philly. 

The York Fair is (or was) a big thing every year. I think it's the oldest continuous-running fair in the country. It's held at the York Fairgrounds. The Fairgrounds also host (or hosted, pre-COVID) a lot of big shows and events, like gun shows, outdoor shows, women's shows, etc. 

It's a pretty industrial-type blue-collar town. Downtown York doesn't seem to be the nicest place, but a lot of the outlying areas are pretty nice and calm. 

There's a town named Intercourse over near Lancaster that lots of people find pretty novel. 

I feel like we have a higher than average number of 18-wheelers on our roads here. In addition to a lot of industry, we also have a lot of large warehouses. 

York is in a big valley and has a lot of industry and hence crap that gets released into the air that kind of settles here. We have a lot of cancer, thyroid diseases, etc. 

Our main gas stations/convenience stores are Rutter's and Sheetz. They have decent made-to-order food. Rutter's has great chocolate milk. Turkey Hill is in Lancaster, and they have great ice cream, iced tea, and ice cream. 

America's oldest brewery is 80 miles away in Pottsville -- Yuengling. They offer tours with free beer tasting.",t2_89rmy,PayEmmy,0,1601613769.0,0,t1_g7daici,g7daici,True,[deleted],t3_j3o005,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorkpa/comments/j3o005/moving_to_york/,Moving to York!,/r/yorkpa/comments/j3o005/moving_to_york/g7daici/,10,r/yorkpa,0,10
"God don't move here. Fuck I hate this place more than I can possibly explain.

Look, you'll have a great time if you're not poor.  If you are making a cross state move, I imagine you're well enough off.  But I can (and frequently do) go off for absolute pages and pages as to why this place is the garbage capital of Pennsylvania.  We got racist hate groups, anti gay hate crimes, a booming drug trade, a failing infrastructure, terribly low numbers of professional workers but a wealth of minimum wage (or just barely over) jobs constantly cycling through workers, huge class divide, a church on every corner (I'm in the minority to bitch about that one) a very high theft and/or assault rate, the list goes on.  We're consistently among not only the top 5 most dangerous places per capita in Pennsylvania, and always among the top 10 worst places to live in PA.

Pros: our state/county parks are well funded somehow. My favorites are Nixon Park and Rocky Ridge. I spend a lot of time in both to get away from the awful people here.

And we have a crazy selection of places to get food from at any and every quality level. After all, we are on a ton of truck routes.  Get used to sharing the road with tons and tons of trucks from all driving skill levels.

Don't let the cost of living here fool you.

God I really hope they haven't gone downhill since then.",t2_61nge,Razorshroud,0,1595299262.0,0,t1_fyq6pgy,fyq6pgy,True,Win_That,t3_huyn3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorkpa/comments/huyn3v/favorite_restaurants/,Favorite restaurants?,/r/yorkpa/comments/huyn3v/favorite_restaurants/fyq6pgy/,3,r/yorkpa,0,3

"We were told that if you feed them live they won't want frozen any longer. Not sure if thats true. Do you breed your own live? How is the up keep on that? We've considering doing that. Is there a specific breed of mice? My husband and i own three corn snakes and want to expand cause my one is gonna lay eggs soon. Considering doing a whole shelf with the mice and incubator at the top, her underneath, and the others underneath her. I'm not sure. Definitely would love input if you ever get a chance.

I keep snakes but I feed live as it's best for their well being as pets. If you need to feed frozen I can link you to my breeder in Shippensburg.  The easiest thing to do is breed mice/rats yourself and freeze depending on how many snakes you have and what your budget is.,t2_cgh9b,tagvsworld,0,1595047682.0,0,t1_fyfog6x,fyfog6x,True,BrightsideAve,t3_gyyovz,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorkpa/comments/gyyovz/does_anyone_keep_snakes_and_have_a_frozen_feeder/,Does anyone keep snakes and have a frozen feeder supplier?
