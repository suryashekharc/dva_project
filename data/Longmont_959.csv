You don't have to sign any ""service contracts"" like the over-priced precision. On larger projects that require it, they pull all the permits (as required) and upgrade any equipment out of code (like intake/exhaust piping, outdated wiring) around the install to bring it up to current code. (Which I feel should be a given, but just pointing out because of the varying level of ""attention to detail"" and/or corner-cutting some places will do.) They also file warranty and rebate paperwork for you so you don't have to mess with all that.


Not to sound like an ad. I've just had to replace a lot of old equipment over the last few years.


To help with not sounding like an ad, I did find out they do not have emergency response for plumbing issues on weekends. Was kinda surprised.

In an effort to beautify Longmont’s parks in time for warm weather, the city is launching its annual “Clean Up, Green Up.”

The monthlong citywide campaign begins with a grand kick-off from 7:30 to 10 a.m. April 2 at the Sunset Campus, 7 S. Sunset St. From then through April 23, city staff are inviting businesses, civic groups, schools, neighborhoods and families to come together to clean up Longmont’s parks.

Lore Blattner, executive assistant for the city’s Public Works & Natural Resources department, encouraged community members to sign up for the event.

“I believe people like to support and give back to their community; this is a positive way to do that, and it’s fun!” Blattner wrote in an email.

Those who want to help but can’t participate in the kick-off event are still welcome to contribute. To sign up and to pick up trash and recycle bags, email Blattner at Lore.Blattner@longmontcolorado.gov or Taylor.Gifford@longmontcolorado.gov",t2_4qkpx,aydengryphon,0,1648222397.0,0,t1_i22rbma,i22rbma,True,aydengryphon,t3_tnoi36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tnoi36/longmont_kicks_off_monthlong_clean_up_green_up/,"Longmont kicks off monthlong Clean Up, Green Up event April 2",/r/Longmont/comments/tnoi36/longmont_kicks_off_monthlong_clean_up_green_up/i22rbma/,4,r/Longmont,0,4

They wasted my time even coming out because they install and service one brand only. (Lennox). Tried to pressure me into buying a product (and a whole system to go with it) that I didn't want. Tried to add extra pressure on the sale by reminding me how hot the previous three months must have been, and I was risking going through that again if I didn't go with their system.  

Hot Water Now - Called and emailed a couple of times over a three month period. No response of any kind. Finally in the fall I received a very pushy email, like I somehow owed him my business because it was his slow season.

"AT&T is currently shutting off 3G service across the country. If you have a phone that is not on AT&T's whitelist (https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/pdf/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf) that may be what is going on. Although you say you have wifi calling so it likely is on the whitelist. You could also have an old SIM card that isn't fully provisioned for the LTE/5G network and that is causing issues and you may just need a new SIM.


They've been reconfiguring the network around here in prep for 3G shutoff (we still have it active) and that could have caused a cell site near you to crash during the reconfig. (Remote network stuff, not anything on-site.)


The best bet for a resolution with these big soulless corps that don't pay attention to their customers (short of giving up on big carriers and asking the City of Longmont to start their own carrier) is for yourself and any other people you know to all call AT&T care, speak to a human, and have them file a trouble ticket on a service outage. That will (hopefully) get them to send a truck to check out the local sites.


I can also attest to what others have said, T-Mobile used to be the thing to use around here. Ever since the Sprint merger they now have random places around the city where you'll have full bars, no data, or voice calls will drop which never used to happen. They've really gone south fast.

"I wonder what the plaintiffs believe will be the outcome of their lawsuit. 

Delays? Stoppage? 

Delays are possible. People simply want new things to throw into the landfill in 5 years, and reasonable deals on large quantities of highly processed foods (although they often have really good deals on fresh stuff as well). 

Stoppage? Oh lordy, no. Especially for the ""visual impact"" whimper. Have they seen the parking lots at the Twin Peaks mall? Hello, lack of landscaping. Where was the group when that went through? Or every other development in the City...like the legendary depot area. Or even the St Vrain redev...I mean it looks like the beat down, drier parts of Pueblo down in there. And then the traffic flow whine. I imagine this will simply delay things until a study shows the clustermuck it will create is similar to every other growth-induced clustermuck the City has allowed, and it will sail through just the same. I haven't heard of any other proposals for shepherding new commercial development through that look substantively different in the area. They do exist, of course. It's just that this isn't Silicon Valley or Rodeo Drive, or Carmel By The Sea. And this intriguing ""landscaping"" would be a departure by any measure from what was at the location at any time in the last century or two in terms of natural or cultivated fauna. Perhaps they would like some of those nice big Sabal Palms from Florida. From my understanding, the local paleontological evidence in the area shows nice, big palms were indigenous here shortly after everything got stomped out by an asteroid that ended the Mesozoic era. Lots and lots of palms. Bet they would sign off on that. But since then, largely dirt and grass. Lots and lots of grass. 

Growth has chronic and inevitable consequences. Perhaps the group could come forth and compare what is planned to some model developments that miraculously preserve the view scape with free range, cruelty free car parking and 100% organic and free trade traffic integration.

It sounds like there is blame in Larimer County's corner and in the District's corner. A genuine multi-agency cluster.

There are physical limits to development on the Front Range. It is growing fast. The moratorium issue in the article issue is a matter of infrastructure development- it will cost a crap ton of money to provide incrementally growing treated water supplies to the growth. But later, it will eventually run square up against the very real physical limits of water supply marked by increasingly climate-change driven volatility and declining supplies. 

The districts will simply jack up rates to accommodate incremental growth. There will be huge pressures from developers/whiners to shift impact and tap fees back to existing customers instead of applying the costs to the reasons for the growth- new taps. This happens all over. It essentially forces existing customers to pay for growth incurred by developers.

By CHRIS WOOD BIZ WEST MEDIA PRAIRIE MOUNTAIN MEDIA |
PUBLISHED: March 18, 2022 at 6:26 p.m. | UPDATED: March 18, 2022 at 6:26 p.m.


The North Weld County Water District has filed a motion in Weld County District Court seeking dismissal of a lawsuit filed by Eagle View Farms LLC over the district’s tap moratorium.

The district imposed a moratorium on new taps in September, citing uncertainty over 1041 regulatory processes in Fort Collins and Larimer County over its planned NEWT III pipeline extending from North Timberline Road in Fort Collins 5.3 miles east into Larimer County.

North Weld also has acknowledged capacity issues stemming from the high rate of residential growth in the region, along with increased demand from commercial users, including dairies.

The moratorium was partially lifted in mid-February, with the district authorizing issuance of up to 120 taps in 2022, including 50 initially.

Eagle View Farms, which is developing a 24-lot residential community just west of Lucerne and north of Greeley at Colorado Highway 392 and Weld County Road 35, filed suit in early February, alleging violations of a Water Service Agreement through which North Weld agreed to provide water service for the project.

Eagle View seeks monetary damages in an amount to be determined, an injunction forcing the district to provide water service via taps for the project and other judgments, including attorney fees and expenses.

North Weld on Monday filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the developer knew about the moratorium when it contracted to sell a lot in the Eagle View Farms development.

“While the moratorium was in place, and with full knowledge of the imposition of the moratorium, the developer apparently entered into a contract with a potential buyer to sell one of the lots subject to the WSA,” attorneys for the North Weld County Water District said in the court filing.

The filing asserts that the district did not breach its Water Service Agreement with Eagle View, referencing a December letter from the district to Eagle View that stated, “this letter is to confirm that the district does intend to fulfill its commitments made pursuant to the WSA when the district is able to resume settling water taps again.”

North Weld’s attorneys also stated that Eagle View “cannot mandate that the district provide taps in direct violation of a district policy.”

Attorneys for Eagle View Farms and North Weld did not immediately return calls for comment.

"Stop this nonsense.  This may be true in some states but not in Colorado.

Green and yellow are both permissive lights, which means you have the legal right to enter the intersection.  Red is non permissive, and you do not have the right to enter the intersection.

Yellow does not mean “stop if you can”, it legally means “the light is about to turn red”.  Nothing more.

If any part of a vehicle crosses the stop line, they have technically entered the intersection.  This applies to both permissive and non-permissive signals, which is why you can get cited if you stop at a red light but have part of your vehicle past the line.

Colorado law is also pretty clear that vehicles may enter the intersection and stop/wait until it is clear to make a left turn.  There’s even a section of law saying drivers who get a green light must yield to the traffic which previously entered legally.

So long as your exit is clear, not the path to the exit but the actual exit on the other side of the intersection, you may pull into an intersection and wait to turn left.

The Colorado drivers manual says this behavior is discouraged because emergency vehicles may have a hard time navigating the intersection.  But the law itself is clear in that it’s legal to do.

So in summary:

- yellow does not mean stop.  It means the light is about to go red.   
- Colorado law allows vehicles to enter and wait to turn left (or right, or straight) so long as their exit is clear.   
- if you want to make inferences from that, that’s fine.

"That sucks. Obviously, this doesn't work for everyone, but you could get a serious upgrade and pay less with a roommate. If you have a neighbor you already like that is also getting screwed over for example. But I know some people can't do roommates.

I hope this is a good avenue for your kid. From my experience with my kid I think it's designed to be a very low pressure situation. My kid didn't want to be outed in any way and was not. Their teachers reached out to me to ask if they should use their pronouns and I said the time hadn't come for that in class and they were very gracious. The counselor also set up for my kid to use a private bathroom at school and access to the counselor at any time to talk or vent etc. I'm so happy with the resources.

An average Wednesday morning turned frantic for Michael and Lisa Gianetti, when a series of explosions and a fire destroyed the detached garage behind their home at 134 Marshall Place in Longmont.  
  
“I was just looking out the bathroom window, when all of a sudden — kaboom,” Michael Gianetti said.  
  
Gianetti, whose bathroom window faces his detached garage, saw the door get blown off from the force of an explosion. Then he saw fire. He yelled for his wife to call 911. They grabbed their dog, Zoe, and ran out of the house.  
  
Longmont police are continuing to investigate the cause of the fire. Longmont police Sgt. Tim Madigan said no one was injured. He said police received the 911 call just before 6:40 a.m. He said there is no active danger to nearby residents.  
  
Police spokesperson Robin Ericson said in a news release that when officers arrived, the detached garage behind the home was fully engulfed. There were multiple explosions from propane tanks.  
  
Madigan said that when officers got to the scene, they heard three to four explosions.  
  
“It sounds like there was an initial explosion and then some subsequent ones,” he said. “The three or four (explosions) that happened after were post (fire).”  
  
While firefighters fought the flames, police officers evacuated nearby homes. Ericson said firefighters got the fire under control just after 7 a.m. Crews remained on scene to douse hot spots. At that time, neighboring residents were allowed back into their homes.  
  
Standing on his front lawn Wednesday, Gianetti said he has operated a hot air balloon business since the late ’90s. He used the garage as his workshop. Gianetti said he had stored roughly nine tanks of propane in the garage, and that Tuesday night when he was in the garage he had not smelled any leaks.  
  
Not much is left of the garage, Madigan said.  
  
“The walls are completely gone,” Madigan said. “It’s pretty charred.”  
  
Neighbor Isla Delgado, who lives on the east side of the Gianettis, said early this morning she heard her mom yelling that the neighbors’ house was on fire.  
  
“We got up, rushed out of the house and grabbed the (two) dogs,” Delgado said. “My brother heard an explosion. He thought that a tree had fallen down.”  
  
Outside, Delgado saw that there was fire burning right outside her bedroom window. Her initial reactions, she said, were panic and shock.  
  
“There were just these huge flames,” she said. “By the time we got out, the whole thing was in flames.”  
  
Other neighbors were running from their homes at the same time, she said.  
  
Gianetti said his workshop and two of his hot air balloons were destroyed in the blaze. While firefighters prevented the fire from spreading to their home, heat singed siding on the backside of their home, burned up their wooden patio and destroyed a utility trailer.  
  
While their home is still habitable, they aren’t able to return until their gas and power are turned back on.  
  
“I’m just worried about tonight with the storm moving in,” said Lisa Gianetti.  
  
The couple said they had been in communication with some friends in Lyons, who they might be able to stay with.  
  
Police said Lashley Street is closed between Fifth and Sixth avenues while crews work at the scene.

">built-in garden plot

Is it a raised bed? Usually people will fill raised beds with good soil so you might not have to worry about the clay soil issue. Good soil will be looser like potting soil, not clumpy. If it's good soil you can add in Earthworm Castings for an organic fertilizer that isn't heavy (like manure). 

I moved from TX 2 years ago and never had experience gardening so I was in the same boat as you. I've found the most important thing besides the soil is water: if you are like me (lazy lol) and don't see yourself committing to watering every day, it's best to automate it somehow. We built a ""SIP"" [sub-irrigated planter](http://albopepper.com/sips.php) to take care of that, but like others have mentioned you can also automate a drip line or sprinkler zone for that. 

Another thing I've learned is growing from seed vs. buying a seedling. For most types of common veggies, you can buy starter plants from stores which is easier to start out with and not too expensive. The growing season here is relatively short (May 15 - Oct 15) so you can ""extend"" the growing season by planting seedlings, or by starting seeds indoor earlier.

">I used M&M heating/cooling. Their teams a bit hit and miss with heat pumps, you have to talk to Chris Lucarelli I think

That was my experience with them - I had them quote a heat pump install for me and ended up going with Welzig instead (and a Bryant unit) since they seemed much more familiar with heat pumps, but I guess I didn't talk to the right person at M&M (I was super happy with M&M with a recent tankless water heater install though). 

I would definitely recommend welzig though for anyone looking - they (and specifically their installer Saul) did a great job on my recent heat pump and furnace install, and I've been talking to them to come back and add a supplemental mini split for the garage and one stubborn room in the house that never gets enough air from the ducts and they actually talked me down a couple notches in cost from what I was originally thinking for that system, which was nice.

Edit: also, for anyone with a gas water heater that's getting close to needing replacement, a tankless is another great way to substantially reduce your gas usage, save a bunch of space in your mechanical room, reduce your risk of coming home to a wet basement, and also it's just nice to have unlimited hot water. Going from a traditional 80% furnace and 50gal water heater to a heat pump and a 97% furnace for the backup heat along with a tankless condensing high efficiency water heater has made a really shocking impact on our gas usage over the past year.",t2_ck8ks26,rsta223,0,1647048177.0,0,t1_i0be6do,i0be6do,False,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

"Yeah, it's the 5 ton 284ANV with the scroll compressor. Not cheap, but no complaints about heating performance so far.

For less expensive units, I agree that the heating performance below freezing suffers (and even this one I'd never run without backup heat - I've looked at the output graph and it's *bad* under 5-10F or so, which is also when the heating demand is highest), but if you're replacing an A/C anyways, I don't see why you wouldn't pay the 10% extra to get rid of gas heating on mild days. You do still need a furnace of course, but presumably you'd need a furnace with the A/C too.

For a from-scratch system or one willing to do a lot of new work without reusing existing ducts and stuff, I do agree that a mini split is the way to go though (and I'm actually looking at adding one as an auxiliary for the garage so I can heat or cool that space when I'm out there working on my car).",t2_ck8ks26,rsta223,0,1647046802.0,0,t1_i0bbf7x,i0bbf7x,False,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

"There's almost no reason not to get one if you're replacing your AC anyways. The lower end ducted units only work well down to freezing or so admittedly, but the price delta over an equivalent SEER AC only unit is only about 10%, and we have a lot of mild days here during the winter that are well suited to heat pump usage.

You won't be able to fully eliminate gas unless you get a really high end ductless setup (I think those are rated down to -20 for the top of the line units these days), but don't let perfect be the enemy of the good - getting rid of any heating requirements on days above 32F still gets rid of a lot of gas usage (and higher end traditional ducted setups can go down to more like 10-15F before having to switch to backup heat, so even more of the gas usage is eliminated in that case).

We just installed a new heat pump in our house and it seems to do quite well down to 15F or so, but it definitely has needed to use the gas a couple times on the coldest nights. Still way better than our prior gas usage though.",t2_ck8ks26,rsta223,0,1647046070.0,0,t1_i0b9yea,i0b9yea,True,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

">Traditional heat pumps only have 100% heating performance down to around 40 something degrees f. 

My brand new Bryant that can do full output down to 15F would like a word with you.

Sure, mini splits are the best option for pure efficiency, but a more ""traditional"" setup can still absolutely be worth it if you're replacing an existing AC and want to be able to reuse all the ducting and don't want to add the additional heads indoors.

You're right that you still need a gas backup (or electric resistive backup, though I don't see why you'd install this kind of system if you didn't already have a traditional forced air setup anyways - starting from scratch a mini split is a no brainer in my opinion), but you can pretty dramatically cut your gas usage still.",t2_ck8ks26,rsta223,0,1647045820.0,0,t1_i0b9g4q,i0b9g4q,False,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

"Those are all formats. Here are the basics:

Modern: Cards printed in main expansions since 8th edition (2003+). Competitive, 60+ card decks.

Pioneer: like Modern, except cards printed since Return to Ravnica (2012+). Competitive, 60+ card decks.

Commander: This format is unique but very popular. You choose a legendary creature as the commander. To your deck. You have exactly 99 other cards who have to be in the same colors as your commander. No duplicate cards in your decks besides basic lands. You start the game with your commander off to the side and can play it as if it was in your hand. The format is casual, multiplayer, and can play almost any card (some cards are banned, but not many). If interested, I would search ""Game Knights"" on YouTube.

As for helping someone start, Jumpstart is fantastic. Each pack is half a deck with a theme, and they're designed so you take two, shuffle them together and have a deck.

"Geothermal, 5 tons, with in floor heating and integrated hot water, a slightly used but really inexpensive 92% efficient 80 kBtu gas boiler backup, and a fireplace that can keep all 2600 sqft at 75F on about 3-5 lbs/hr of wood if desired. 

The boiler is basically never used so far, although the duty cycle on the geothermal has stayed on close to 70% of the time during the coldest weather. If we get to -20 for an extended period of time in the future (it happens occasionally), the boiler or fireplace may be needed to supplement to keep things warm. I have to fire up the furnace manually occasionally just to make sure it is in functioning condition. 

I did it all myself/hired a drill crew, and my bills went from $200+ a month for the old 80% efficient gas furnace to about $80 a month extra in electricity, and then to nearly zero with the 10kWh of net metered solar. I actually produce more energy now than I consume. It was a lot of work, but the hardest part of all was keeping the drill rig for the geothermal well out of sight from the County. I didn't bother with permits for any of it except the net metered solar. 

The neighbors want to try and get theirs done the same way. 

Geothermal is great in the area if you do it yourself. It is silly expensive to hire it out. The water table is often very shallow, and your drilling will only need to be on the order of a few at 200-300 feet to get a 10 degree temperature difference for the ground flow portion to feed a 5 ton heat pump at around 47F at worst (usually ~53F outflow year around).

We do not use it much, but the AC on a 100F day is so efficient that the system will only run about 15 minutes per hour at worst with our insulation. 

If you want to stay conventional, there are lots of good suggestions in the thread, including from u/aduckedupgoose. But I have yet to find a person who has a geothermal system who didn't pay at least 30k for theirs.

"I'm an HVAC engineer and can certainly talk about heat pumps especially if you have specific questions. You're right to look at mini splits in particular (such as Mitsubishi, LG, or Daikin). ""Traditional heat pumps"" (such as Trane, Lenox, and carrier) all have terrible heating performance. We always design these systems with backup electric heat. Traditional heat pumps only have 100% heating performance down to around 40 something degrees f. 

Mini splits are more efficient and have a bit better heating performance, but still are only providing around 70% capacity at 10 degrees f. If you're looking to have dedicated heat pump, make sure you're getting what's called cold climate technology. It basically just over drives the compressor getting more heat performance at the cost of efficiency. 

Mitsubishi calls their cold climate equipment hyper heat and LG calls it red I think. All the major manufacturers have it under different names. Unless you're using this cold climate equipment I'd recommend having some backup heat installed, either electric resistance or gas.",t2_1166i4,aDuckedUpGoose,0,1647020501.0,0,t1_i09kskf,i09kskf,True,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

You definitely need a backup heating system here with heat pumps.  If you insulate your house and do some air sealing, it makes a really big difference, but you’ll still need backup heat.

"Installed mini splits for bedrooms last spring. Highly recommend kappler mechanical. They do tons and had better plans to position them and the linesets compared to local places and they were similarly priced.

Not only on a per unit basis are they more efficient than whole house AC, but you also don't need to use them as much/everywhere at once.  E.g., there are a lot more days you don't need any ac in our main floor and just run the mini splits a bit before bed.

I also have a whole house fan that I installed when we moved that lets us open up the windows in the morning and bring the temp inside way down (except when wildfire smoke is too much).

In terms of heating, I still wouldn't recommend them. The Mitsubishi we have tanks the efficiency less than 17 and doesn't work lower than ~5. They make a version with onboard resistive heating to allow it to operate in lower temps, but expect it to run 24/7 and be expensive under 0.

Even at warmer temps (40), our existing gas furnace costs much less theoretically to run.  I did computation with cop and existing electric/gas rates and it wasn't even close. We'd probably still have to double gas prices to break even.

Overall, I'd recommend them for individual comfort and lower carbon footprint more than cost.

"I'm looking at this Stack Exchange entry, and I'm pretty skeptical of the argument. IRV does have a spoiler effect, but it's not that cut-and-dry to understand. And in that post they try to argue against ranked choice systems more broadly, by using a carefully chosen example case. They draw a graph that seems to imply that yellow and green are trying to form a coalition, then they imply that the voting system is incorrectly letting red win instead. But their scenario has almost 80% of green-first voters ranking red over yellow. So it's not much of a coalition, is it!  
If a voting system does something you don't like, you have to really figure out if you don't like it because it's an unfair outcome, or if it's because it's an outcome you just don't like. And the sticky part is that the only way to figure out if a voting system is unfair is to find or invent another voting system that is more fair. But as we get deeper into the weeds, we get closer to ties and chaos, and then fairness becomes very difficult to discern.  
This is why IRV is a good choice. It's fair \*enough\*, it's easy to explain, and people already use it for major elections.",t2_j0o0xmcm,proDemocracyTroll,0,1646887345.0,0,t1_i02iayr,i02iayr,False,AutoModerator,t3_t6q7ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/t6q7ms/weekly_open_discussion_complaint_and_rant_thread/,"Weekly open discussion, complaint, and rant thread",/r/Longmont/comments/t6q7ms/weekly_open_discussion_complaint_and_rant_thread/i02iayr/,2,r/Longmont,0,2

"In my nerdy heart, I have more love for the Condorcet method, which I learned about from CS50. But once I looked into it, I learned that the reason ranked choice voting is used synonymously with instant runoff voting is because politically, instant runoff voting has by far the most traction. This is because IRV is the easiest ranked choice voting method to explain, and it is also the only RCV method that is currently in use in general elections. So, while IRV still has a spoiler effect, the improvement over our current voting system is so dramatic, and its political traction is so much better than the others, that its defects seem irrelevant in context.",t2_j0o0xmcm,proDemocracyTroll,0,1646885075.0,0,t1_i02e2i7,i02e2i7,False,AutoModerator,t3_t6q7ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/t6q7ms/weekly_open_discussion_complaint_and_rant_thread/,"Weekly open discussion, complaint, and rant thread",/r/Longmont/comments/t6q7ms/weekly_open_discussion_complaint_and_rant_thread/i02e2i7/,1,r/Longmont,0,1

In any case, makes sure you know what you’re paying for. Some of these companies will try to trap you into paying all sorts of ridiculous fees—like “payment portal fees” when they won’t accept any other payment methods. Another trick is to get you to pay them for the utilities by not putting them in your name, and then charging you per month for “handling” it. 

Also make sure that you get all promises in writing. Repairs, paint, carpet, whatever.

"It's especially odd in light of their claim that all of their social events are held online. I assumed that the ""FT WFHrs only"" rule was in place to protect the group from overexposure to Covid. In essence, keeping gatherings limited so only those who restrict their movements and interactions can attend. 

I don't know what other circumstances are so unique to FT WFHrs that PT workers or otherwise couldn't respect or identify with them. And, if the group exists to provide social interaction for people who are uniquely distanced from others, then what makes this group so special, compared to every other group on discord if it *really* only entails online interactions? And further, why, if it's all online does anyone's physical location matter? 

This person really sounds like someone who likes control, and is accustomed to being at the center of attention. The stereotypical Reddit mod type, trying to play mod IRL. No wait, not in real life.. just on a different online platform. Apparently.

I'm puzzled too over what they mean by needing to keep the group to a manageable size. If you're not picking a venue, counting seating, arranging refreshments, or passing around copies of anything.. then WTF restricts how many people can easily ""attend"" your events?

"I wonder how similar our games are. Two chairs at each end of the table, your teammate sitting next to you. Each person has a solo cup placed on the table in front of them (a hand's width from the edge, and elbow to thumb length from the end). You throw the die with the back of your hand facing forward (wrist basically locked). Die has to hit the table, then bounce to the floor without your opponents catching it. If they don't catch it off the bounce, you get a point. If the die goes straight into your opponent's cup, that's a ""plunk."" No points are awarded, but your opponents have to finish their beers, and the plunk gets recorded in sharpie on the table. If it's your first plunk, your opponents (or everyone else in the room) assigns you a ""die name"" which is yours for life. Your die name gets written on the table and the plunk is tallied.

"Joan Peck won the mayoral election in November, but her victory did not reflect the preferences of the voters. Gregory Harris took votes away from Tim Waters, who was preferred by more voters in November than Joan Peck.

Longmont mayoral elections should take people's second choices into account for future elections (ranked choice voting), so that our election results reflect the preferences of the voters and not the technicalities of the voting system.

My argument in detail:

1. Gregory Harris was a far-right candidate, so if his voters had to choose between Waters and Peck, an overwhelming majority would have voted against Joan Peck.
2. Joan Peck won by 1,049 votes. Meanwhile the spoiler, Harris, got 5,819 votes.
3. If there had been a runoff election, only 60% of those that voted for Gregory Harris would have had to choose Tim Waters for Waters to win the runoff.
4. The voters actual preferences were not reflected in the election results.

This is a glaring example of why we need ranked choice voting, particularly for Longmont's future mayoral elections.

"You can grow most things pretty well if you focus on starting early. It is too late to start a lot of longer season stuff already. 

However, we grow these on an annual or near annual basis:

-kale 

-spinach

-mustard

-carrots

-beets, a few kinds

-eggplants, a few kinds

-sugar snap peas

-string beans of various sorts

-daikon radishes

-horseradish

-strawberries

-peppers, several kinds

-tomatoes, several kinds

-cucumbers, few kinds

-musk melons and cantaloupes

-strawberries

-chard

-fennel

-green onions

-turnips

-okra

-sometimes leeks

-artichokes (start in December at the latest, make amazing visual displays in the fall)

-spaghetti squash

-acorn squash

-butternut squash

-lots of  daisy family, rose, lily, and other flowers for insect control and the table

-mushrooms- these can use a lot of very poor shaded unusable areas of any yard. 

-sunflowers for the birds. 

- thyme, basil, rosemary, tarragon, etc


You can also plan for a range of fruit trees. We have fall apples (crisps), peaches (a few types), apricots, italian plums, d'anjou pears, sweet cherries (a few types, have to be really picky about them to survive), montmorency cherries, lots of seedless grapes (5 varieties), blackberries (a couple of 2 crop hybrids), a few raspberry types, a mulberry, lots of chokecherries, and hops. Stone fruits (prunus) are a 1 in 3 to 1 in 4 chance of bearing a lot in a given year, except apricots which are hardier, and most of the other fruits (malus) are regular producers. 

So you have a lot of veggies and some fruits to choose from if you are into it.  

We don't grow stuff we can get in the store that will keep well, like potatoes, although our neighbors love 'heirloom' potatoes, or yellow onions, or corn (takes up too much space). 

Soil is the focus. Lots of manure, generally available for free, mixed with sand and straw, and chicken manure is great for plants like tomatoes and peppers.

Raised beds really make the daily walk through and tending easy, and there are a number of great designs out there to easily make. 

Automagic watering is also an almost necessity for us. You can spend your evenings enjoying a little weeding or harvesting or just enjoying things, and be able to take off for a weekend in the heat of the summer. 

Bees are very helpful, especially with fruit trees and berries. 

 It sounds like a lot, but really- once you set yourself up for it every year, the rest of the entire list above requires perhaps an hour per day for most of the season and two hours a day during harvest after a weekend of startup at the start. The infrastructure takes a long time and is a financial investment, however, to get to that point.

"You can 100% garden in CO and your season doesn't have to be short.  If you have a hoop house and plant cool season/hardy annuals you can extend your season by at least a month on either end.

They overwintered and are ready to go for when it starts to warm up consistently and the cover comes off the hoop house for good.  I have lettuce starts growing indoors now.  They are ready to be transplanted out into the hoop house for an early cool season crop (other cool season crops you could do are arugula, mizuna, brocoli, cabbage, cauliflower).

"You're going to want to get snap peas in the ground in about a month.  What condition are your beds in?  If there were weeds in the fall, you might have a growing season or two where you need to work hard and keep pulling until most have sprouted and been dealt with before going to seed.  IMO weeds aren't bad.  Weeds that have gone to seed are the devil!  

I've started to see the gardening centers fill up with mulches and soil amendments.

"You can totally garden in Colorado. We don't have a super long growing season in our USDA hardiness zone (5/6) but there are plenty of things that grow well here. Carrots should do fine. I've never tried snap peas but they should do well here in our climate. I've had okay luck with pumpkins -- they grow well but squirrels LOVE eating them, so make sure to put up some good fencing or set up one of those motion-activated sprinklers to scare off the pests.

If you want some other stuff that's easy to grow and that really thrives in CO, I would highly recommend cherry tomatoes, zucchini and cucumbers (those always go gangbusters in our garden). Lettuce and kale are pretty easy, too.

And if you're worried about your soil, there are tests you can do to see the pH and nutrient balance, but it might be enough just to mix some good-quality garden soil into what you've got. I haven't found the soil here to be too bad but it sort of depends where you are. 

I don't know about local classes in Longmont but there are certainly some down in the Denver area, offered through garden centers like Echter's (up in Wheat Ridge - see [http://www.echters.com/Events/Calendar.htm](http://www.echters.com/Events/Calendar.htm)).

"r/gardening might help a bit, but the main issue in the front range of Colorado is soil content types, or if you choose, you can do your own soil type with a raised bed.

1. How much space do you have?
2. How much dirt do you have if you dig down before you start hitting sand or gravel.
3. Do you have a budget yet for upfront building/digging costs.
4. How big of a garden?
5. What type of edible plants are you planning
6. Can you start your plants indoors on a table/floor (expect water to leak) with a bright/grow light

"I had it done in 2017. Went from 100A to 200A. I gathered 4 quotes in the process; $2k, $6k, $8k and $21k.

I threw out the $2k because I didn't trust that quote at all and either they missed something or would do it incorrectly.

I threw out the $21k because I think they didn't actually want the job and were pricing themselves out.

I ended up taking the $6k quote because it had everything detailed out well with itemized prices that made it clear to me that they thoroughly understood the scope of the work involved from trenching to boring to new copper in the house.

I would recommend them but they moved to Florida. One thing to consider is that if you are getting quotes from places that have fleets of fancy vinyl wrapped vans . . . someone has to pay for those fancy wrapped vans.

"While I guess I can't know this for sure, I do feel like it's a reasonable assumption that the two witnesses mentioned who called 911 were not videoing the crime because they were both apparently *on the phone with police* trying to get help.

Longmont police are seeking the public’s help in identifying a silver sedan and a woman who was reportedly yelling for help while being placed inside it.  
  
About 7 p.m. Monday, the Longmont Emergency Communications Center received two different calls from witnesses in the area of 16th Avenue and Kimbark Street, said Robin Ericson, spokesperson with the Longmont Public Safety Department.  
  
The witnesses said a woman was yelling for help as she was placed into a silver sedan. Police believe the sedan was a newer model, Ericson wrote in an email. The vehicle traveled eastbound on 16th Avenue and was last seen turning southbound onto Collyer Street.  
  
Longmont police are trying to confirm the identity of the woman and check her welfare. The department is also seeking video surveillance to obtain the vehicle’s license plate number.  
  
Police are asking anyone who witnessed the incident or who has a video to contact officer Sheena Wilson at 303-774-4300, extension 2452, or the Longmont Emergency Communications Center at 303-651-8501 and reference case 22-1652.",t2_4qkpx,aydengryphon,0,1646349904.0,0,t1_hz8xlsq,hz8xlsq,True,Sturzkampfflugzeug86,t3_t5x738,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/t5x738/longmont_police_seek_help_identifying_vehicle/,"""Longmont police seek help identifying vehicle, woman yelling while being placed inside it""",/r/Longmont/comments/t5x738/longmont_police_seek_help_identifying_vehicle/hz8xlsq/,18,r/Longmont,1,18

"I don't think that's embarrassing at all, with the market and wages the way they are it's extremely hard to get your foot in the door for ownership unless you already have quite the financial leg up or family help (or both); my spouse and I only managed it through sheer dumb luck finding the right relatively cheap property (in late 2019 before home prices went even crazier), and we were in the category of being fortunate enough that both our families could pitch in enough to help with the down payment or even then I don't think we could've managed... we were incredibly lucky, I don't think we'd ever be able to afford to buy here now 3 years later. You shouldn't feel any shame in not having managed to buy by 30, the market stuff is nuts and only getting weirder.

The last time we personally looked at rentals right before we did buy, we liked the Wyndham apartments up by McIntosh Lake on the Northwest end of town and the Grandview Meadows on the Southwest side, as far as bigger complexes went; we had thought both were very affordable for being a bit farther afield of downtown and had decent amenities, plus were close to open space. I'm horrified glancing at either places' rates pages now though, but I'm not sure if that's actually still cheap for the going market rates and I'm just blissfully ignorant of exactly how much rent in the area has gone up, or if there are better deals to be found. We'd found the best good options for finding smaller landlords to still just be CL or FB ads, just of course be aware of scammers (never put a deposit down or give out any personal info until after touring in person, the usual). I wish you the best of luck, maybe someone else will have more recent tips than I've got. 

I think most displaced Louisville/Superior residents I know are renting in Broomfield, Westminster, or other cities nearby.

"I've won several million in grants.

What you ask is for someone to invest several tens of millions of dollars towards your very specific personal dream that will benefit almost nobody in the end. Come back when you are better. 

Perhaps *you* could, you know, try grant writing for a change. 

It isn't negativity. It's reality. Bring something to the table that will benefit actual people commensurate to the ""other peoples' money"" you are asking to be invested. Otherwise, I'd rather be invested in preventing the disasters of commercial exploitation that the sugar mill represents. Things like preventing the destruction of our water and air and soil for a cynical private return, to be cleaned up with sovereign wealth levels of public funds so someone can go do parkour and revive mid 20th century vintage construction techniques. 

But I do agree there are doers and dreamers. I believe you categorized yourself explicitly in the latter in your post ""Call me a dreamer..."". 

So come up with a proposal that people will want to throw money at, if you really are a magical ""grant writer"" just poised to unleash the deluge of free money to fulfill your transcendent destiny for an ecohood. 

Or perhaps just go buy a place to do it yourself. I do admire people that are willing to try, and sometimes they are even successful at showcasing new things.

"I wouldn't say it focuses on them. It has a small section on the topic. That said, I don't know that ""agrihoods"" would make much sense here.  If the soil is as damaged as some fear it wouldn't make sense to do much in-ground planting on the site as remediation would likely entail scraping the area and carting off contaminated soil to be incinerated or landfilled/treated elsewhere. Once the area is scraped soil would need to be brought in for farming. Why not an eco-hood, which isn't as focused on ag output and more planning the human habitation, homes created sustainably with SOME agricultural activity between them.  Earth built dwellings with smaller intensive garden areas like raised beds and swales (lowered beds) in a combination of hugelkultur and permaculture water catchment design. Intensive growing using built soil, compost and organic matter amended with humic/fulvic mineral deposits and manure from local farms. Greenhouses for winter greens. Water catchment and greywater would be key to the intensive growing and the whole neighborhood should be designed to channel all rainwater into cisterns and growing plots.
