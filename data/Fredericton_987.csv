"He was a landlord I had back in 03-04. It was a shit hole but it was all we could afford as full time students. Besides his inability to fix anything properly or in a timely manner or at all, or the fact that he sent his daughters to come clean the place a week after we had moved in because the previous tenants wrecked the joint, he also never submitted our damage deposit to a rentalsman. When we moved out he said he wouldn't release our deposit because of a bunch of damage that had been there before us that he never came to fix. We didn't find out he didn't submit our deposit until we contacted the rentalsman over this matter. I called him and told him we knew what he did and he said something to the effect of ""well I never give deposits to rentalsman because they can't be trusted"". After about an hour of arguing he finally agreed to write us personal checks to the amount of our damage deposit. He gave them all to me by hand the following day,with a serious attitude.  

Aaaand then he cancelled the checks and turned his phone off.  

Luckily one of my roommates was not only in Law at UNB but his gf (now wife) was the daughter of the Campbell's and after some threats of legal action he wrote us more checks.

"ugh this, like COVID or not if you're sick, you shouldn't be working in a kitchen, full stop. You're handling people's food for god's sakes. I know sometimes we gotta work but COVID really should have been a reminder/wake-up call that we need to stop expecting people to work when they're sick, full stop - and that there should be reasonable accommodations when an employee has to take sick leave. Hot take, but if an employee having to take a few days off while sick topples your whole system, then your business clearly isn't properly staffed/managed, period.

It just exposes how fucked up capitalism is at its core - an employee should never have to worry about missing their rent payments if they're sick, a business should never be so understaffed that they can't handle someone being out on sick leave, and employees that are well shouldn't hate their job so much or be compensated so little that they aren't willing to cover shifts for sick employees. It's a very multi-layered problem.

"> I'm looking for people just starting out. Anyone who is willing to share anything. 

In what context?

I appear to have conflated you with the guy looking for an artist to support his new Twitch channel for free... which is an error... but the base comment stands - artists are entitled to compensation for their work as much as any other skilled labourer, and offers to trade artwork for ""exposure"" are worthless and insulting

If you are offering to provide critical feedback on artwork, with no expectation of retaining the art afterwards (or commissioning the work in the first place)... OK, I guess. That's not ""insulting"", but lacking any insight as to why your critique, specifically, offers value (Are you a retired art gallery director? A former ad executive who managed an art department?) I don't imagine many will be eager to take you up on that offer.

"Look, I don’t really want to argue about this but I think your comment speaks for itself. The numbers are not clear on long covid and 30% seems way too high from literature I have read. If you want to go on anecdotal evidence like you suggested I would counter that literally my entire men’s hockey team has had it in the last two months and there has not been even a remotely serious case. That’s over 15 guys; most of whom were completely asymptomatic. My bout was 2 days max, not even in the top 10 sickest I have ever been.  In fact we got a cold in our house in the fall and it was ten times worse tbh.

Secondly and putting personal war stories aside, you do realize that if your saying the range is 10-20% (which is higher than science is saying but for the sake of discussion let’s go with that), that the corollary of that is that there is a 80%-90% chance that it won’t be severe or long standing, assuming you have been vaccinated.  Also 80%-90% IS the “vast majority”, that’s how math works.

"My previous landlord informed me that some home-owners either don't know or refuse to deal with the government. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case given the ghosting and stuff that's gone on.

Here's what to do:

&#x200B;

**1) Contact (preferably call) the landlord with a final warning.** Inform them that you know your rights. A damage deposit MUST have been submitted to the Rentalsman within 14 days of your moving in. Whereas you did not receive a receipt or tenancy number form the Rentalsman and the Rentalsman's Office doesn't have anything, your landlord violated the Residential Tenancies Act. This means they're in some pretty deep trouble if they don't give you your money (and can still be in trouble regardless).

&#x200B;

**2. Regardless of whether you get your money, contact the Rentalsman and tell them everything** (incl. the landlord ducking you). When you do, you should have a copy of your lease and some form of proof of your e-transfer to the landlord. They will ensure you get your money back and probably ensure that they don't get away with it in the future. If you already got your money through 1, do this anyway.

"Yeah in their recent post for the renaming contest they explained it (also proceeds from the beer are going to Ukrainian humanitarian aid). Here was what they said:

The name “Wraith of Putin” was coined in 2015 by the brewery’s former co-founder, a Ukrainian immigrant, after the annexation of Crimea. As a native to Odessa, she felt that releasing this beer gave her an opportunity to speak about atrocities happening in her home country and to ridicule the Russian ruler.

>We understand that New Brunswickers may be at different levels of readiness to ease the population level mandatory measures. However, signs are present that support shifting to individual-level protective measures.  These signs include:

 

>·         High case numbers without overwhelming levels of severe illness.

>·         Stability within the health care system, while high numbers of people testing positive.

>·         High vaccination levels among eligible New Brunswickers.

>·         Population-level protective buffer provided by the large number of individuals who recently recovered from Omicron.

>·         Availability of medications and therapies, including antiviral therapies, to treat those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are at risk to experience more severe illness.

 

>New Brunswick’s recovery aligns with progress noted across Canada and globally. This recovery will continue to be monitored by Public Health, so that New Brunswick can respond promptly if required.

 

>The new schedule for COVID-19 data reporting is inline with other provinces across Canada, both Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan are reporting COVID-19 epidemiological information on a weekly basis.

I did PSW for years and recently switched to construction, and I gotta say don't waste your time in home care. The work is very needed, and rewarding on some level, but draining on every other level.

"Management of the FIP isnt great (or atleast wosent the last time I worked there), the guards tend to be pushed through their certifications there so they can be given job offers to fill empty schedual slots, at least pre covid the locker rooms and pool area were like never cleaned, and almost always only got a hose down at the end of the night. I saw a lot of gross acts of negligence there by guards, and anyone that made a fuss about it or didnt kiss up to the boss (who was never there) got kicked to the curb after a couple years there. A lot of the good guards at the FIP often end up migrating over to the Y once they get tired of the bs.

"Wrong


They're not selling their houses in Ontario and coming here. The majority of properties are going to corporations in Ontario. Some are named corporations, but many are numbered corporations. The numbered corporations are usually moderately well off people who pool their money and invest in ""under priced"" properties outside of Ontario.

They mostly bought in Ontario in the early 2000s and then used that equity to buy more properties.


People 40 and over I believe will have been the last generation to own a home on their own. Within 10 years the majority of the housing stock in Canada will be owned by corporations. And they are seeking to maximize profits not by doing cheap renovations and flipping but holding and raising the rent.

They can then go public and sell shares in their company. The only way to continue to provide shareholders with a yearly return is to yearly raise rents.



Remember the 2008 crash? That was over extended home owners with bad mortgages defaulting. That mistake won't happen in this situation. Those bad mortgages were packaged up with good mortgages and bought and sold. So when many people defaulted they brought down the whole system. Now the homes are owned by corporations, not the mortgages like before. They learned their lesson, why rely on a home owner to pay their mortgage when the corporation can buy the home and rent it out to people instead? Now the occupant needs to pay the rent and if they don't the corporate owner can easily find new tenants.",t2_qpw9r,flummyheartslinger,0,1647992901.0,0,t1_i1qap8k,i1qap8k,False,suhawhee,t3_tkdb7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericton/comments/tkdb7p/anyone_shopping_for_a_house_right_now/,Anyone shopping for a house right now?,/r/fredericton/comments/tkdb7p/anyone_shopping_for_a_house_right_now/i1qap8k/,10,r/fredericton,0,10

Not always true. They do track the tickets and will know if the same license plate keeps getting tickets or is always parked in the same area without a pass. Then it will get booted or towed just like someone in the system that wasn't parking properly. Not being registered by them won't save you if you are a repeat offender.

"Hi I live in maple ridge outside of Nackawic.

It's roughly a 45 minute commute into Fredericton when I go. It's not terrible but there will be times where the weather is too bad for you to commute so your job needs to be understanding of that.

I live on the ridge so it might not be as bad as in town but the weather here is pretty crazy. It changes often and we still have snow right now. If you're not a fan of winter this is not the place for you.

If you have a specialized diet it will require you to commute to Fredericton to get your groceries, the grocery store here is small but well stocked. If you like to eat out you have the option of on restaurant and a couple of fast food places.

Also if you don't know anything about Nackawic there is a mill, depending on where you buy you will smell that mill.

"I used to work in the UNB Security office.  So....1. UNB is private property and requires a pass to park anywhere on campus.  Signage is not required in every single location, but you will see green signs around the parking lots that say ""parking pass required"".  Obviously if they put a sign up at every single parking spot that would be a whole lotta signage.  You'll see signs sparingly at the Aitken Centre parking lot.  Not their responsibility to make sure you're paying attention.  2. It doesn't matter what other vehicles are doing, and they'll tell you this if you go in with this attitude to contest the ticket.  3.  If your mother's vehicle has never been issued a parking pass they have no idea who the vehicle belongs to on campus.  Due to privacy laws they can't go to SNB to find out who the registered owner is, so if this is the case, your ticket will just sit in limbo cause they don't know who to bill for it.  3. DO NOT TAKE #2 AS AN EXCUSE TO CONTINUE TO PARK THERE!  The Parking Pass Supervisor is super smart....has almost an eidentic memory. Your ticket may sit in limbo, but it does sit in their computerized system, so if he asks the office to look up a license plate and it comes back with multiple unpaid tickets they can, and will (LEGALLY) boot your mother's car or tow it off campus for continuing to elude the rules and to register your student number to that plate.  Sometimes they'll make you pay the high cost to remove the boot, or the cost of the tickets, whichever is less, then tell you to either buy a pass or NEVER park that vehicle on campus ever again.

"Just an FYI....most people who live in NB would consider a 45 minute commute to be ""long"".  I lived in Ontario for a while, so I know 45 minutes to big city folk is really good.  So, you'll get a lot of people saying it's a far drive, but if you live outside TO, it won't be too bad.  Maybe in a few years when you get used to life over here you'll start to feel like we do....driving more than 20 minutes to work is too much!  

That highway is pretty good in the winter, but I have heard of people getting stuck because of high winds and snow drifts, but I can't remember if that happens closer to Woodstock.

"I lived in Nackawic for 9 years before moving to Fredericton this past fall. It’s a super small town, population around 1000, mostly older population living right in the town, not much (read:zero) cultural diversity, but it has its gems! It’s beautiful to walk around by the water in the summer, and if you play tennis or basketball in the summer or skate/play hockey in the winter it’s perfect! In the winter you can also snowshoe or cross country ski around the nature trail. Not much selection in terms of eating out (there’s a subway and a pizza twice as well as a Robin’s donuts) but the Waterfront Pub just outside of town is pretty good, as is the Chinese place right next to it. The commute to Fredericton is about 45 minutes, my mom used to do it every day and she made the most of it - it’s really not too bad if you don’t mind driving! As with every small town, everyone knows everyone’s business, so be careful who you choose to share personal things with, but for the most part people are very friendly.

"So just to give everyone here a better picture of what we're dealing with. My son has a vascular malformation or hemangioma on his left arm. Doctor said right after he was born is that it will go out within 3-5 years, long story short, he's now turning 5 and has not yet disappeared, yet it has grown significantly and we're bothered as well as he is. We're an immigrant here, and right after we landed here in Fredericton, we went to see a doctor here (knowing that they're probably more experienced and knowledgeable than the previous doctor in our country) the doctor referred us to Dr. Swammy, and he said it will go after 6-7 years, but still not a trace of anything positive.

"That's all well and good, but ignores that in any sport that is physical, the men's version is going to be more competitive.  An elite men's team is always going to be better than the comparable elite woman's team...by a lot.  it's not sexist it's sex, plain and simple, boys are bigger, stronger, faster and more agressive than girls on average, and at peak performance that disparity gets further apart.  If you think prefering the superior product is discrimination, well, you are probably right, other things being equal, people generally prefer the better product.  

That doesn't mean there isn't a market for it, or that some people won't prefer it, but it's silly to ignore the disparity.   I personally prefer college football to the NFL...but I recognize that the NFL is a superior product and I don't begrudge the excessive coverage the NFL gets, because I recognize that they are the preferred product for most people.

I didn't suggest force, and I didn't suggest I knew what was best for homeless folk. I did suggest we do basically diddly squat to work toward understanding how to help people who suffer from addiction, mental health, and homelessness.

How can you \*want\* help when you don't trust anyone? The question is, how can we build trust, how can we work with the mentally ill and addictions in order to understand and actually help them?

>What a strange concept, consequences for our choices?

Have you ever considered you are also flawed and may make a bad judgement call on whether you should take that extra oxy to get through the pain rather than wait for your next scheduled dose? Have you had to wrestle with your thoughts that keep taking you back to the abuse you suffered and turned to a drink or two to forget?

All of these are bad life choices, and yes anyone can say ""well you made the choice, live with it"", but for many of us not having to deal with abuse and mental health issues is not a conscious effort, it's circumstantial. So count yourself lucky to not have to deal with the pain and suffering others have experienced that drove them to the streets.

Today you cry for affordable housing, but those people being pushed out of their homes may end up on the street turning to drugs and alcohol and not wanting to be in shelters. Those people you wanted to help while they were in better days, are they not worthy of help at their lowest point?",t2_10vy0m,monkeynotes303,0,1647884443.0,0,t1_i1k0v4a,i1k0v4a,False,hereforsimulacra,t3_tjdu52,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericton/comments/tjdu52/as_weather_warms_advocates_call_on_city_of/,"As weather warms, advocates call on City of Fredericton to finish 'dysfunctional' trail",/r/fredericton/comments/tjdu52/as_weather_warms_advocates_call_on_city_of/i1k0v4a/,2,r/fredericton,0,2
"It took freddy about 35 years to build one real skateboard park, just do what the little kids did in the 90s , go sell cookies in the mall, create awareness , attend city council meetings and voice your displeasure lol. People should look at what the kids had to accomplish before that park got built , and trust me , lots and lots of money didn’t come from taxpayers wallets . It came from the people who were negatively affected and had to do the work themselves . It’s kind of funny to hear cyclists complaining after we get a skateboard park, I don’t wish that battle with the city on anyone , if you need documentation from the last 3 decades let me know, I’ve got hundreds of pounds of documents and rejection letters.

"I think it's worth considering that ""people who choose"" are making their choices whilst suffering mental health problems such as, but not limited to, traumatic abuse, schizophrenia, clinical depression, all of which contribute toward despair and addiction.

It's a narrow mind that then labels this as a true choice to stay on the street. Homeless shelters can feel unsafe, and remove the last vestibule of a sense of control the homeless have over their own lives.

Homeless people do NEED stability and help. It's that we approach it so naively and without appropriate federal and provincial help that efforts often fail or are a drop in the ocean solutions. The problem is simply ""throwing money"" at the problem and hoping it goes away is wasteful, but that's the mindset of yourself and our leadership. Throw money at it, make it someone else's problem and then wash your hands on the failed efforts. Imagine just throwing money at your failing marriage, it won't fix it. There is far more in the mix than a financial component, as important as that cash is. We need to understand the myriad of complex human aspects of homelessness and addiction. The problem is that's a hard sell for people who only have money to throw at the problem and will rather give up on it than work harder, this encompasses not just your apathy but the people that represent your apathy in the government.

When we charge those in power with our own flawed attitude and expectations you are going to see more of the same. Crap in, crap out - rinse and repeat.

"I (F) worked a closing shift at Regent Mall and walked home to my apartment on the corner of Montgomery and Regent during my first year of univeristy. The creepiest part of the walk was going over the overpass because at that time of night there was no one around and on more than one occasion someone would come out from underneath the overpass either in front or behind me and I would dart across the road.

My suggestion would be to find a friend or family member who you could call while you walk if you don't have a friend to walk with you. I would do this a lot after my first few incidents and while I was walking I would describe where I am like ""I'm at the corner of Prospect and Regent"" that way whoever is on the other end would have something to tell authorities if something ever did happen. 

I would also invest in some sort of self-defense deterrent, because I personally would much rather be safe than sorry.

"Personally I fear uni guys in dorms and parties than I do the streets. While I do fear the unpredictable street folk (some are fine and nice while some very very ill on drugs) Ive never had a run in with them. They might say something scarey when you walk past them but just give them space and youll be okay. 

That said walk without headphones in, bright lit areas, avoid people on the sidewalks. Im extremely paranoid about walking at night but so far so good. A large percentage of female sexed people get sexually assaulted at UNB at the parties so when I say avoid them. Avoid them. Have fun with people you know and trust well. Have friends looking out for you. 

Behind sobeys in the summer downtown can have some undesirable folks, they like to hang around there abit. As well as any of the tent city walking trail areas. Sometimes they have dogs that have bitten some people (northside). But UNB and stu have Saferide so use that as much as you can. Sometimes it fill up quick so get in line when u can!

"I had to walk about 10 min to my car on a regular basis long after dark for 6 years. I was walking along King Street and Regent Street or sometimes St John Street which is parallel but not a boulevard. 

I found Regent St is well lit and feels pretty safe. Houses are right on the street so you wouldn’t get attacked without any door to run to. One thing that’s a bit unnerving in Fredericton is that there are quite a few “long-term” homeless folks that hang around and they’ll holler at you every now and then. But as people said, walk with confidence (ie. have like…an assertive step that indicates you won’t stop to chat or whatnot) and stay friendly when you turn them down and you won’t have any problems.

I’m a petite woman and I was hollered at every now and then but people always respected my responses. I had “the poem or joke” guy stop me a few times (he’s pretty well known around here; he’s passed now though which made me sad to hear), I never gave him a dime but always said Hi and that he looked sharp today or stuff like that. He’d chuckle and leave it. If you act spooked they can get a bit of a kick out of it and start getting creepy so just show that you’re not flustered and they are cool.

"As a man I can't speak to the same safety concerns, however, Fredericton, at least the Southside is relatively quite safe. As other commenters have noted follow standard safety measures and keep your wits about you and you'll be fine. Probably. If you're a UNB/STU student, use safewalk or saferide to get home safely, I'd particularly use this if you're out drinking a lot. The cabs to can get you home safely too. I've heard ancetotally that the area around the gas station on regent and preistman has been less safe but I feel like that has more to do with people's fear of homeless folks then an actual uptick in crime. 

The only Northside area that I've heard had crime issues is union street but again, I've only heard that. And a lot of Fredericton natives roll their eyes at that.

"Near the university; just avoid the palmer and windsor street area when you hear parties because there could be drunk idiots but that could be said for downtown as well (towards the river is *downtown* and away is *uptown*, the university is the cut off for most people but yeah). Regent street is usually floded with drunks as its closest to the university so depending where you're going just use caution. 

It isn't *dangerous* on the northside (opposite side of the river) but there are lower income housing units there so the people tend to be less proper at night.

"So here’s the deal - there is no such thing as a “safe” neighbourhood anywhere in the world. And yet, I’ve been in a lot of rough places in my life (Kandahar, Cape Town townships, Detroit) and there are no really “dangerous” neighbourhoods either. Just degrees of risk and proximity to dangerous people. 

Life isn’t like a video game, where you walk into a dungeon and every monster immediately attacks on sight just because you are a PC. Real world monsters attack because they are specifically looking for a victim, and that can happen *anywhere*. 

It is no accident that most assaults happen in the home or workplace, and most victims know their attackers. 

But with that said, there are things you can do to limit the opportunities for assault. 

1. The biggest deterrent to attack is *visibility*. So stay in the open. Be in well-lit areas. Use major walkways with more traffic as much as possible;

2. Carry yourself with confidence. If you give off body language like you are the biggest badass around and you own the place, a potential attacker will assume there’s a reason for that and give you a pass (again, on the very *rare* occasion where you actually cross paths with someone looking to assault a random person). Don’t look scared, crunched in, nervous - be a badass!

3. Be aware of your surroundings - keep your “head on a swivel”. Don’t plod along, lost in your own inner monologue, *look around* and be aware of dark spots, places that offer cover, or someone sketchy lurking half out of sight. And if your Spidey-sense goes off, *trust it* - you might not be consciously aware of why that bush in the shadow seems off, but if it does, cross the street or give it some extra space;

4. You can help build self confidence by being active. Go to the gym, run, stay in shape. Self-defence classes can help too, although that’s super-dependant on the instructor (some places I feel like are more about scaring people than actually teaching self-defence);

5. Have a plan. “If I get attacked *right now*, what do I do?” (The right answer is almost always “yell” and “run” - but yell *what* and run *where*?) Make that plan part of your routine (that includes maintaining situational awareness and presenting confidence); and 

6. Do not let good security practices dominate your life - you can do all this stuff (once you are practiced enough) as muscle-memory without having to be on a hair-trigger all the time. Let me point out again that if you will be attacked in your lifetime, *it is nearly 100% that you will know your attacker* - so while all this stuff is good practice, the odds of a momentary lapse in awareness being deadly are practically zero - otherwise, there wouldn’t be a single pedestrian that ever safely made it home, like, *ever*.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"They are able to tow and impound your car if it's on the campus and has an outstanding fine. I can't see anything else in their by-laws but it could possibly impact you renewing your license if their bylaws are also enforced by the city/province, this looks unlikely though.  


>Fines for parking and traffic violations are to be paid to the Financial Services, Student Account and Receivable Services, Integrated University Complex, or at the Campus Security Office. Failure to pay fines within 7 days may result in cancellation of parking privileges afforded to the vehicles registered with the Security and Traffic Department and relative to which the fines have not been paid. In the case of a student, and after the 7 day grace period has passed, outstanding fines shall be entered as a charge on their student account. Vehicles subject to unpaid fines may also be towed or immobilized without notice and at the owner's expense and risk.

"Side suggestion for a different time of year, but you should check out Miramichi's Irish Festival when it's back up and running. It hasn't happened for 2-3 years since the pandemic, but it happens the third weekend of July. 

The Saturday night is always an epic time. There's a proper Irish Band, usually Raglan Road (hope that's not who you're referring to here lol, I've seen them play at Dolan's once upon a time). The beer gardens use to happen inside of an older rink, but they've since started having it on the waterfront in Chatham, which has been a great success. The last few years Saturday has been absolutely packed, tickets have sold out. It's just an awesome drunk shoulder rubbing time.

"My house is similar, I live on a easy grade hill with the house facing downhill. Bought the house in winter so didn’t realize there was a drainage/grading issue due to the snow cover. A previous owner had water come into the basement and used Wisecracks. In the 5 years I’ve lived here, water has never come in but it pools around the foundation at the back of the house under the deck so when it rains and/or during spring thaw, we have a pump running to send the water down the driveway rather than leave it against the house. 
We’ve had about 5 different companies come look over the lawn and they all say French drain to fix the drainage and then a slight grade correction. We have neighbors close on either side of the house so there isn’t enough room to put a drain in unless we tore up our paved driveway which runs along the side of the house.
Most quotes were between $5000-$13000, depending on if we wanted a retaining wall at the back of the property.
