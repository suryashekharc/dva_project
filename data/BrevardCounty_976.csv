"I'm not a parent but was formerly a student at both Stone and Palm Bay.

It was fine and I turned out fine. Each school had some fairly typical problems (fighting, bullying, lack of funding) but I feel like those problems were blown up because of the perception that each school has and the idea that x school is better (conveniently, the schools in the high income neighborhoods).

If you've got a kid who is academically driven/advanced then there's less to worry about as heathersaur said. Advanced kids are in their own little bubble away from the general population since they all take classes together. This does come with some issues in the sense that these kids can develop a sense that they are ""better"" than everyone else. There's also the perception that these kids should be more mature and adult-like but they're just kids at the end of the day.

I am not a parent but I think it's important to let your kid have fun and explore their interests in middle school. The academic competition and pressure really amps up in high school, especially if he keeps taking advanced courses where college is expected. At the end of the day, if he isn't being challenged and engaged you can switch schools. I'm also of the opinion that a great education starts and ends at home. As long as you nurture his spirit and his interests and are there for him when it counts he's going to be a good adult.

Stone ***is*** a great school for STEM. When you are looking at score from schools, remember that it's the overall average not broken down at all. I went to both Stone and Palm Bay high - both schools that tons of people here like to look down on, yet I know so many of my classmates that did STEM/Honors/AP/Duel Enrollment that all went on to college to get Bachelors, Masters, and Doctorates.

And honestly? A lot of those people who went on to be 'high achievers' credit their teachers from Stone for helping them find their passions and nurturing it early on. I am still friends with some of the teachers I had while I was at Stone because of that as well.

If resources are to be shared to students they should be vetted by the staff.  This did not occur.  If the teacher had a lesson plan to discuss the topic, that’s a different story.  That’s why you do lesson planning, to ensure an educational discussion on a topic is supported by a framework with the details defined so that it can be reviewed and approved by that teacher’s administration.  I have my own job, I have no desire to stand on peoples lawns or dig through all the curriculum.  I trust the teachers and principal I know personally and have met to do their job.  My concern here is that an outside party operated outside of the curriculum process.  I’m also concerned that this group has a stated and concerted effort to create and introduce content targeted at the k-12 environment.

And yes I have reviewed their history and content and I have plenty I disagree with as does most people.  The popularity or intellectual dishonesty of it is immaterial, though, as I stated above and many times exhaustively.  I’m sorry you like this website. Your personal fandom clouds your critical thinking about the appropriateness of the scenario that happened to my child.

"It’s funny because it’s true.

2018 exit polls:

>According to exit polls, 61 percent of non-college-educated white voters cast their ballots for Republicans while just 45 percent of college-educated white voters did so. Meanwhile 53 percent of college-educated white voters cast their votes for Democrats compared with 37 percent of those without a degree.[1]

Continued erosion of the conservative levels of education

> At the beginning of this century, Republicans held an 11-point edge on party affiliation among college-educated voters. By the time Barack Obama was president, the figures had flipped to become a 4-point edge for the Democrats. And as President Donald Trump’s term was winding down, the numbers had come full-circle and the Democrats had a 13-point edge among college-educated voters on party affiliation.[2]

Why do you think y’all conservatives have gone full on anti-education and anti-intelllectualism? Because you’re being led that way. Like sad little sheep. 🐑

As I stated in my comment that you're now replying to, more recent data shows otherwise.  


The industry with the biggest delta (after controls are applied), is warehousing where women make 0.96:1 can that have anything to do with biological differences between men and women and their ability to consistently lift heavy things?  


Women make 1.01:1 to men in engineering and science.  This gap gets bigger when looking at young, unmarried women in technology.   


""Legal"" is an interesting industry to look at.  Uncontrolled has the biggest gap, but controlled data has women in the lead.

Is it more likely they are biologically predisposed to lower paying careers… or are the on the ground effective freedoms of a class of individuals who until the modern age could not participate fully in our democracy possibly be a slight shade lesser than the written law?

"In my teens and 20s I skimmed here (33 now). The furthest North is Satellite Beach, but the last place to check because of the reef, only skimable at dead high tide, and still its a little sketchy. Paradise Beach Park will get good skim at times, but there's life guards and crowds, have to time it there just right. Double Tree is the next place south, hit or miss there depending on the sand bar. Next is Dunkin Dounts area and the walk up beach access there. After that, Long Doggers Beach access. Still going south, Boardwalk. This place use to fire all of the time and the beach we visited most tired with the the inlet. Now between Boardwalk and Ocean Ave, a few beach access there, hit or miss. Now south of Ocean Ave in Melbourne Beach, plenty of places to check all the way to Inlet, including Spanish House. All of these will break a little different depending on where the sand bars are. The holy grail is Sebastain Inlet. We would go there ALL of the time, the best waves I've caught in Brevard. I've been there when the sider was working. This will be the most consistent place. While you're down there, you can check Southside Inlet too. It's been a long time, but it was skimable at low tide. There's been times when north side will fire and south side isn't, and vice-versa. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

"I don't disagree with but you are comparing apple to oranges. We don't live in the past, it use as a reference. Just because a field is dominated by women doesn't mean women pay less. STEM degrees paid more most degrees. A women who majors in Norwegian cannot complain of a man is making 100k+ as a engineer or doctor. Women tend choose less demanding degrees. 

We as a country value harder fields of study.  You use a example of teachers, ok. (Paying teachers more is another argument, and I agree they should earn more)  Female teachers make less than female nurses who makes less than female engineers who make less than female neurosurgeons. Is there discrimination amogst women? 

We live in the safest and most prosperous time in human history. There are more millionaires then any point in history. Women have more rights now then they ever had. 
Compare a female engineer vs male engineer (excluding overtime, just base salary) The gap is negligible. 

Anedotal Example: In my field, we have female engineer who doesn't like to stay late, doesn't work overtime or come in on weekends. On the other hand, most of the male engineers willing do those things. It's not a knock on her, that her choice. But who going make more money?

"Not at all actually. The thing is that the speaker presented *Prager University* and tried to insist that it's ""real truth."" That's a huge issue. 

Moms for liberty are terrible, because they call for the complete removal of normal topics they find morally degenerate and participate in the erasure of knowledge that could be extremely helpful or educational. Things like ""gay people exist"" or ""how to be safe when trying to figure out your identity"" are really important topics that could literally save children's lives, and Moms for liberty oppose that on a moral basis and would like to have it completely erased, metaphorically ""burning"" the books. 

Prager U isn't a topic, they're a **partisan political entity**. Specifically, they're a partisan political entity renowned for extremely biased presentation of facts in the name of political advocacy. They straight up lie in many of their videos, using miniscule subsections of data to suggest broader trends that are completely unsupported by larger-scale data and, in the case of sociological issues, almost unilaterally rejected by actual experts in their field. Their own website literally describes them as ""advancing Judeo-Christian values,"" which adds another layer of bias, this time religious, which again is something that the government sponsored workers should not be advocating for as ""REAL TRUTH."" 

Any government sponsored educator presenting Prager U as 'real truth' is literally pushing a political agenda and discouraging cross-reference and finding alternative opinions to try to politically bias children. They're normalizing the acceptance for biased sources at face value without further investigation, they're allowing religious and political advocacy to children, this is extremely bad. 

Moms for liberty oppose social education on moral grounds, and that's bad. This isn't that: it's in opposition to a known flawed and biased source being presented as academic fact. This is a breach of academic and educational integrity.

"Except you’re also using wrong data to justify your point but it’s actually proving the gender wage gap. You’re using controlled data that should always show a 1:1 ratio if pay is equal.

In 2022, the uncontrolled gender pay gap is $0.82 for every $1 that men make, which is the same as last year. Payscale’s gender pay gap report does not show that the uncontrolled gender pay gap has closed during COVID-19. If anything, closure of the gender pay gap during 2020 and 2021 reported by other institutions such as the National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE) may be due to high unemployment, especially among lower wage workers, which artificially shrinks the gender pay gap. In subsequent years, the gender pay gap could widen.

The controlled gender pay gap is $0.99 for every $1 men make, which is one cent closer to equal but still not equal. The controlled gender pay gap tells us what women earn compared to men when all compensable factors are accounted for — such as job title, education, experience, industry, job level, and hours worked. This is equal pay for equal work. The gap should be zero. It’s not zero.

In other words, women who are doing the same job as a man, with the exact same qualifications as a man, are still paid one percent less than men at the median for no attributable reason. The closing of the controlled gender pay gap has been extremely slow, shrinking by only a fraction of one percent year over year.

"That's a good question and I'm sure a lot of studies were conducted prior to this route being established. I don't know about a bus service but there was talk about the vacationers taking rental cars to both Orlando for attractions as well as Cocoa Beach/Port Canaveral for cruises. 

Logistically I don't know how this works because the people would get their rental car in Melbourne, drive to Orlando and do their tourist things and then drive to Port Canaveral for a cruise. What would they do with the rental car while on the cruise? 

As far as local impacts to business in Melbourne I could see the tourists staying around in town for a night before a flight out or maybe spending the night in Melbourne before venturing on to the attractions in Orlando or wherever. 

I think marketing wise Tui is flying people on a chartered flight to KMLB instead of commercial into KMCO and Melbourne KMLB has injected the Orlando name into the airport to make tourists think they are flying to Orlando and not a village over an hour away on the beach. Marketing in regions outside of Florida paints Orlando in the middle of the state with ""nearby"" beaches lending to the conception that Melbourne is part of Orlando. 

This flight came from Manchester which is a city 200 miles northwest of London. I've flown from KMCO to both London Gatwick as well as London Heathrow.

"Came looking for a thread like this so heres my story. Fortunate enough to make a good income and own a home. Everyone who says home values have doubled is correct but after looking at Melbourne/Viera/Rockledge housing prices there’s no way I can make the move from my current location to there. I’d have roughly $150k to put down and still can’t justify it. A $2k plus mortgage is insane and so is $2k a month for a 700 sq ft studio apartment. 

For anyone thinking home owners are lucky, it comes with its own struggles. My home owners insurance has doubled in 5 years to over $5k a year.

"I've been here for over a decade and I cannot wait to get out of here. I am only here because of my kids. I have split custody and their mother lives here and she will not leave because she lives with her mom. So I'm stuck here. There is absolutely nothing for kids to do here. There's a skating rink now but that's about it. If you Google kids, the only thing that comes up are parks. And most of the time my kids don't want to go to the park cuz it's 95° and 90% humidity. I know that's most of Florida but still, in Titusville there's nothing to do. If you're older and you like to fish and you don't have kids, then Titusville would probably be pretty good. You could get a boat and just fish your heart's content. But consider this, this is a coastal city that you have to drive almost 30 minutes to get to the beach. Playalinda which has no facilities other than an outhouse. In that beach closes at 6:00 p.m. Or you can go to Daytona which is about 45 minutes away. Or you can go further south to Cape Canaveral which is about 35 minutes away. Cocoa Beach is about 45 minutes away. You're going to be driving almost an hour to get to the beach from this place. if you want to do anything at all with your kids it's another 30 to 45 minute drive to either Orlando or Melbourne. If you have your heart set on moving to Florida then move to some place where you're actually going to experience Florida. Go over south of Tampa or something but you better be ready to open your wallet cuz it's extremely expensive to live down here now. It's not really like it used to be where you could sell a house up north and come down here and buy a mansion on the beach. I don't know how that compares to where you're coming from but the cost has just gone up and up and up. I don't even think there's a decent house listed for under $300,000 right now. And I guarantee you it's nothing special unless you're going to be forking out 400,000 or more.

A special note if you are not in Florida, everybody thinks they want the sun in the heat until they live down here a few years. After several years of walking to your mailbox and getting completely soaked and sweat, it wears on you. I can't wait to get out of this hell hole.

Edit: I almost forgot the crime. The crime is getting really bad in Titusville. I'm pretty sure we are on par with Orlando and last I checked we were higher than the nation's average.

"The censorship of books across the nation should not be ignored.

However, the biggest goal of penalizing schools for not ""respecting parent's rights"" is three-fold:

1. Stop regular people from working for school districts under concern of being prosecuted and having their pay taken away.
2. Prevent children from learning anything other than a narrow, reductionist, point of view.
3. Shutter public schools so that tax dollars can be funneled to (religious) charter and private schools. 

It's the long game and it's working. Across the country people have learned that they can harass and threaten school staff and school boards until they get their way (Randy Fine) because of ""freedom of speech."" Just like Texas' abortion law that allows unrelated people to sue someone who they presume aided and abetted an abortion, here we have people who may not even have children in the school system threatening to use the courts to air their grievances. 

Of course this is about censorship and preventing kids from learning about the human condition but it's so much more.

"The Brevard chapter of Moms for Liberty has provided Brevard Public Schools with a list of 10 books found in local school libraries that the organization says violate Florida statute against providing obscene materials to minors.

While other chapters of Moms for Liberty elsewhere in Florida and the US have pushed to remove books with racial and LGBTQ themes, the list provided by Moms for Liberty in Brevard instead focuses on books that contain explicit sex scenes, graphic accounts of sexual assault, foul language and depictions of drug use or underage drinking.

The chapter believes the books violate Florida’s statutes on providing material “harmful to minors” to children. A member provided School Board members with a lest of ten books it so far considers objectionable, and members have said more books could follow.

Damsel by Elana K. Arnold
Forever by Judy Blume
Lucky by Alice Sebold
Monday’s Not Coming by Tiffany D. Jackson
Not My Problem by Ciara Smyth
Red Hood by Elana K. Arnold
Sold by Patricia McCormick
This Book is Gay by Juno Dawson
This One Summer by Mariko Tamaki
What Girls are Made of by Elana K. Arnold
Some of the books are available in middle school libraries. BPS is reviewing the books, a spokesman said. Nine of the books are works of fiction. “This Book is Gay” is a nonfiction book about sexuality and gender. Moms for Liberty included the book because of an illustrated passage of a nude man and instructions for how two men can have sex with each other.

Florida law forbids adults from providing material harmful to minors, defined as material that:

Those who violate the statute could face felony charges.

Edward Birk, a Jacksonville-based attorney who specializes in First Amendment Law and who represented FLORIDA TODAY in its successful 2020 lawsuit against the Brevard County Sheriff's Office to release jail security video footage, said disputes over school reading lists are common, but is unaware of any cases in which school officials were criminally charged for library books.

Birk said whether or not the criminal case had any merit, the accusation that school officials had committed felonies by distributing the books could be enough to convince them to pull books from library.

""That's certainly going to have a chilling effect on whoever runs the school or runs the library,"" Birk said. ""They don't want to be charged for a crime, regardless of the outcome.

The books have inspired heated discussion on Moms for Liberty’s Facebook page, with some adults saying they read similar books at a young age and others arguing that the passages are not suitable for minors under any circumstances.

Moms for Liberty in Brevard has formed a committee that is reading through books in BPS libraries to find content that isn’t appropriate for minors.

Rising concerns about book bans prompted Families for Safe Schools, a parent organization that opposes Moms for Liberty, to hold a protest outside a Brevard County School Board meeting. They gathered with holding signs with slogans including “I don’t co-parent with book banners” and “banning black history books is just racist.” 

Elsewhere parents have made more sweeping objections. The Indian River County chapter of Moms for Liberty challenged 156 books in Indian River County School District libraries. Some of the challenged books include discussion of LGBTQ or racial identity and social justice. Others are books that include sexually explicit or violent scenes, including popular novels like Water for Elephants, Thirteen Reasons Why, The Color Purple, Of Mice and Men, The Bluest Eye and Beloved.

In Brevard, criticism from parents caused the school district to remove “Gender Queer: A Memoir,” a graphic novel that contained illustrations of genitalia and sex acts.

"Yeah, girl. It absolutely is unacceptable. I’m thinking of reaching out to some local friends in the area to see if they happen to know someone who ever experienced this there. I want a sense of how common this is - yeesh! Also, if you just moved to the area, let me give context girl to girl in case you find yourself downtown (I’m not FloGrown, either 😉):

Traxx is the spot open latest in dt Melbourne, so naturally, it’s generally peoples’ last party stop. When I used to go, the pours were heavy. Fantastic for the wallet, not so hot for your blood alcohol level. It’s also up against the train tracks (hence the name), and theres a parking lot in back, so there’s a bit more isolation than there would be outside some of the other bars because of the sheer space. Open late + heavy pours + isolation may play a role in the apparent drugging/violence frequency. Also, FWIW, there’s a high college student population due to FIT.

I, personally, didn’t have any creepy or violent experiences here when I used to go about 5 years ago, and neither did anyone in my immediate circle. Granted, I was always with 1+ people who looked out for each other. “Mixed bag” is closer to my experience of Traxx than “ghetto.” There has been violence in the area on more than one occasion, which I don’t mean to minimize. I moved here from a large city, though, where there are dense areas of poverty and violence, and this just isn’t that. Again, speaking only for myself, -I- never felt this was riskier than any other bar in downtown, as long as I was with trusted people (as always).

"If you ever go to Off the Traxx (not sure why you would, but...), you'd be able to tell pretty quickly it's the sort of place you wouldn't be surprised that sort of thing happens.  It's tough to explain, but the way it's positioned (far end of the walkable part of Downtown Melbourne), the atmosphere (feels like it was kind of slapped together, especially with the fluorescents from the adjoining pizza spot), the wait staff (always busy even on relatively slow nights), you just get the vibe that it's the sort of place that pays lip service to safety but doesn't really give a shit.

For what it's worth, there are a bunch of other drinking spots in walking distance that are all way safer and more well-put-together, depending on what you want:

* Matt's Casbah is open-air and does live music, generally gets a little hectic but not an absolute madhouse.
* Main Street Pub typically has late-night drink and dance stuff going on on weekends, if you're looking for an atmosphere that's club-adjacent.
* Iron Oak Post does a lot of local band stuff, plus their beer selection is huge and they do a couple really good mixed drinks.
* Hell & Blazes Brewery is on the other side of the railroad tracks from Off the Traxx and does some good food and their own brews.
* Hurricane Creek does line dancing and has pool tables, I think they might have darts as well?  Haven't been there in a while, it's not my scene.
* Whiskey Business is tucked away from the main strip and is a pretty quiet whiskey bar (most days, I haven't checked on Fri/Sat so it might be a little more lively then), if you just want someplace to talk and sip an old fashioned.

None of these places strike me as the type of place you'd expect to get roofied, though generally the slower and quieter the less likely a place is to have that happen.  Off the Traxx is an outlier in terms of both reputation and happenings in Downtown, I'm kind of surprised they haven't been shut down yet, but there's always a cop car or two parked outside it so at least it's on their radar.",t2_5gb2f,badpath,0,1647794206.0,0,t1_i1f5arr,i1f5arr,False,Thetman38,t3_tiac4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/321/comments/tiac4o/review_of_traxx/,Review of Traxx,/r/321/comments/tiac4o/review_of_traxx/i1f5arr/,7,r/321,0,7

"I believe you are mistaken to think that Merritt Island was actually designed.   With the exception of some very small ""Historic"" downtown districts, which Merritt Island does not have, all of Brevard County is an ad-hoc hodge podge of neighborhoods built by different developers at different times, with no planning or coordination whatsoever.   Not only was there no consideration for pedestrian traffic, but darn little for vehicle traffic either.  This is obvious when you want to drive from one neighborhood to another, anywhere in the county.  For example try driving from Desoto to Jackson Ave. in Satellite Beach without going on A1A or S. Patrick.  It is possible, but what a maze!   Pinetree Drive to Eau Gallie Blvd is another maze.  Both routes are known only to the ""free-range"" kids who grew up beachside (anyone remember the 'hidden lake' bike trails).  However, Pinetree Drive to Desoto is not even possible in a car.

Roads and streets designed for multi-modal transit is better for everyone including people who only drive.

"Interesting find. LOL!

Of course, if the two neighbors wanted to visit, they could cut a hole in the fence.

I'm sure if you looked, you'd find lots of examples pretty much anywhere in the country where there are subdivisions and PUDs. I don't know which came first, but from your example, there's a house facing Tropical Trail and an adjoining property that is in the subdivision behind. I'm not sure what else could have been done. Whomever developed the subdivision did not own the lot on which the other house sits, so they built on what they had. I really don't think many would support using eminent domain to make sure every subdivision has an outlet to another street.

Disclosure: I live at the end of a street on MI, so I have a similar drive to the next lot. (Google says it is three minutes to drive to the house to the east and a different three minutes by another route to the house to the south.

"Hello. This is Brandon with Tidal Wave Roofing. Thanks for reaching out. In light of what you said about your last roofer, we are licensed and insured and only do work in Brevard county. The owner, my wife's uncle, has been in the home building/roofing industry here in Brevard all of his life. 
Right now the cost to install a shingle roof is running around $400-$425 a square for any roof under a 7-12 pitch. I probably don't need to tell you this but prices of shingles continue to go up each month, as does everything else. I don't mind getting you an accurate estimate. We do all of our estimates using online software that calculates the square of your roof as well as the layout using satellite imagery.  I would just need you to email me some information, (address, type of roof, existing leaks?) or you can call Lynnanne in the office. The email is contact@tidalwaveroofing.com and the office number is 321.720.5224. If you would like, we can also arrange for someone to come out and inspect your roof. If you decide you would like your roof replaced the process usually takes about 5 days for a shingle roof depending on permitting, inspections, and weather. Metal installation times vary. Please feel free to google us or check out our website www.tidalwaveroofing.com. If you have any other questions or construction needs you can message me here or call the office and Lynnanne can arrange a meeting. Again, thanks for reaching out!

"> She didn’t have her name on anything related to the property and there wasn’t a will

If the property on paper was already ""owned"" by another family member, then that's more complicated. Family could claim that the agreement was between the tenant and roommate, who didn't actually own the property, so there's no binding lease agreement. The utilities being in the tenant's name is a good sign though, establishes residence. 

But typically in Brevard a tenant cannot be evicted, for any reason, until the owner has set a court date first. Not sure if this has already happened and the person didn't tell you about it but that's the procedure across the board. If the family is trying to strong arm him into leaving, that's NOT a legal eviction and they're not supposed to do that. 

Obviously the owner of the mobile home doesn't seem to want a tenant, as they've noted they want to sell it.
