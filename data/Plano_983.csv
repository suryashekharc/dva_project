"[Legacy Trail](https://goo.gl/maps/v8G8ty4UwEy7CpjS8) (bike route because it stays on the trail)

4.3 miles of continuous trail, passes under roadways. 

You can get a little more length on the north end if you cross a few streets (connects to the even longer Preston Ridge Trail, but it has regular crossings). 

On the south end, gmaps doesn't show it (old aerial photos), but the trail continues past the dog park and has a big loop in Windhaven Meadows Park. Probably good for at least 0.5 mile more. Windhaven also now  has good facilities/parking if you need.

The path is about 8 miles, is along roads but only crosses 3, and does so at lights. It's mostly nature- or at least undeveloped property-adjacent and is a lot more pleasant than running through residential streets.

From Arbor Hills, you can go west along Parker but the north side of the street lacks sidewalks in one stretch and is unnecessarily dangerous for pedestrians, in typical Plano fashion. However, if you weather the danger, run Parker to Plano Parkway and take that north, that's an extra mile or so.

There is a very good hill on Windhaven, beginning at the train tracks just east of Plano Parkway and going up to the apartments at Austin Ranch. It's maybe one of the best hills in all of Plano!

"I always run the [Preston Ridge Trail](https://www.plano.gov/1486/Preston-Ridge-Trail) (green belt) that goes north and south between Ohio and Coit. From one end to the other and back, it's a half marathon but you do have to cross 5 major intersections and probably about 15 minor streets each way. However you have so much visibility that you aren't having to stop last minute when you spot a car. I personally run really late at night so there's not as many cars on the road but if I see cars coming I just run on the sidewalk adjacent to the street towards the cars until they pass and then cross. But that trail is like perfect for me, the path is like 10 feet wide, has soft rolling inclines and declines, dedicated & marked intersections to cross the street, and you don't need to worry about uneven sidewalk, branches, or dirt on the path.

However the [Chisholm Trail](https://www.plano.gov/1451/Chisholm-Trail) that goes NW to SE goes is 11 miles (from end to end and back) which I am pretty sure only crosses 1 major intersection and the rest of the time the trail actually goes underneath the roadways at the major intersections.

"Plano has quite a few options in that income range. West Plano is the wealthiest area of the city while farther north or west near Carrolton/Allen/McKinney for newer builds. You could also buy some land out East Plano by Parker and build a custom home if you don't mind a slightly farther commute and waiting for construction to complete. It all really depends on your priorities.

Personally, I recommend moving as close to work as possible and finding a home that's well maintained. I've toured homes with leaky roofs, mold, foundation issues, broken plumbing, low quality remodeling, or pest issues that can add an additional 5-10+% to the home's cost before move-in.

"A good avenue to consider is answering a room for rent ad. Sometimes those owners are easier to deal with than commercial places like apartment complexes.

I was arrested for public intox without having a drink
The inexperienced officer was offended I called him out and arrested me based on my opinion alone 
Oh he also threw me in jail, I mean took my shoes off and socks and asked me to sit down 
I did …. I sat down and waited 6 hours to be booked in without water or the toilet on 
Good thing I wasn’t drunk tho or I’d need to pee right ? In the toilet . No pee , in fact I drank out of the toilet like the guilty scum citizen I am
Fuck you Plano police I want my $385 for speaking my mind or I’m moving and never paying Plano police with my taxes again 
You guys need to train this officer he is a criminal 
He lied , he said I soiled myself and placed my clean shoes in a red soiled bag marked “soiled from urine” yet I had my urine soaked pants on the entire time 
Yet when I received my belongings to leave I had to leave with see through blue slippers for crazy ppl and was not allowed to wear my shoes until I left 
And yes you better believe it 
I opened the bag and smelled my shoes and they smelt just like me ,,,. Clean, truthful and honest not like this immature cop who should be reinstated into what I’d line to call… reeducation, maybe call it thinking for a change —- side note that’s the class I have to take bc I need help psh… fuck off Plano police thanks to you I want ever go downtown nor out anymore bc guess what— the only danger I fear in life is not ppl it’s the police and how they can incriminate you without any recourse for their actions yet I can be fired for showing up late

Use their pee. It's worked wonders for me and I've done it twice with someone's urine if the opposite sex. Don't panic, just heat it up to a not burning temp, then hold it in your underwear, between two layers of underwear.

Doesn't show in any obvious way even with pants.

I accidentally boiled the pee a bit too long and uh, it was REALLY HOT one of the two times

I ended up panic blowing on a cup of steaming pee on the bathroom and totally still passed the lab tested pee test.

Synthetic pee does miss when you know the most current best brand, but using someone else's, who's is clean, is the best.


And things like thyroid meds don't matter from them, speaking from experience xD

Don't fight your case to the gov, find a friend or family and sell the importance of this to them. Dealing with a random ua is up to you after, I recommend freezing your specimen and dividing it into two, one for now, one for later.

"Hey friend, it's all fine, don't get too excited by all of this. You're making it more complicated than it needs to be. The likelihood of you being in the direct path of a tornado is low, like really low. However, a storm that can make a tornado can bring equally damaging high winds, down drafts, hail, lighting and heavy rain. Frankly, these are the things you should always beware of because they happen much more often. 

You just need to have a plan to deal with the weather where you are and understand the warning systems. If the siren is very loud, it's going off in your immediate area. That means ""seek shelter"" in the safest place you can find NOW. A tornado or ""potential"" tornado is near. However, it just doesn't matter if it's a mile from you or 15,000 feet over your head, get in shelter and wait for the ""warning"" to be ended or expire. In that ""warning"" period all kinds of things can happen. Don't try to ""figure it out"", just wait it out. However, most powerful storms also move pretty fast.

"Weed is federally legal where I live (Canada) and they can still require you to pass a drug test (including weed) to do your job and maintain your employment. I am pretty sure it’s the same way in the US, not all labour requirements are really based on legality alone and some are based on the requirements or preferences of employers as long as they don’t discriminate based off of protected reasons. It might be insurance for workers in the field around heavy equipment or driving company vehicles or it might be for other reasons. I know department of homeland security and insurance companies can require it in the US and I think Delta 8 is federally legal (not sure) so that probably wouldn’t change state to state.

You can definitely test positive for certain things with no issue with a doctors note and valid prescription depending on your role in the company. I know someone who tested positive for amphetamines because of a valid prescription to adderall and they were fine because they talked to their employer beforehand and had a prescription and doctors note for it.

"If you think they're going to purchase tests themselves and have people screen at work you've never dealt with these processes and how HR / legal manages things.

And that's if they're not required to get multiple bids from outside companies which will slow down the process and drive up cost higher.

Given the number of employees and the city size Labcorp or Quest will almost certainly be used by the testing company. This means people scheduling time off to go and lost productivity the city will have to eat the costs for. Not to mention if anyone pop's positive and IF they follow through with firing them they'll have to backfill roles.

My peers who had to cheat corporate test purchase the fake “clean” urine and fill up a condom. Tape/strap/ hell glue that bad boy to your leg. Make sure it is close contact with skin as it needs to be the correct temp.

">they give fake names so the city may or may not know who they are and they aren't able to resolve or fix any issues if something goes wrong?

I think the city does record their information off of their ID's. I don't think there's any standard for what IDs are acceptable. I am thankful they do that at the minimum.

Where it gets interesting is where the worker gives TO YOU a different name from what is on his ID. Nicknames are common.

I do not know what they are allowed to do for issue resolution but from experience, they do nothing.

I am thankful the city has provided what they have. They do help somewhat to reduce negotiation and expectations/skill alignment mishaps.

My first impression was to reply, 'someone needs a diaper change' but I'll be civil and assume you're not trying to be an ass and simply have a different perception.

Re: the stabbing guy. He was carrying a knife and both my wife and the police had to intervene. I still have the police report on that guy. My lesson learned here is that if they start scheming or back peddling in the car, take them back to the center immediately. No clue what you mean by colonizer mindset.

Re: native landscaping. I am a member of [https://npsot.org/wp/collincounty/](https://npsot.org/wp/collincounty/) No, I was not speaking of Native Americans and no, there is no other term used to describe indigenous plants.

Re: half-assed jobs. I'm glad to teach and do a fair job of imparting knowledge. I've had everything from concrete, landscaping, and full spectrum residential construction help via the center (yes, I can do pretty much everything). The problem comes when the guys cannot learn, remember or focus long enough to do the task. Some have been told they're stupid their whole lives where some are clearly not stupid and just need a little guidance (what and why) along with encouragement. Some have a surprising range of mental issues and have done jail time. With exception to jail time for violence, it's just an excess of baggage to me- I'll give them a chance.

Re: being a cheapskate that doesn't also contribute labor.

There are some good workers there. But they are human with inherent human problems (some with more than others).

On the up side, the city provides the center and works as a middle man somewhat. They do not check immigration status or eligibility to work. They do keep track of their identities (but some workers use different names that make it hard to track should issues arise). They do help negotiate expected work to be performed and rates. A few times I've called back to report serious issues and they were able to see who I hired (by pulling up my phone number) but seemed unable or unwilling to do anything about the issues.

"I've picked up probably more than my fair share to do work at my house.

You don't want guys with cars because that gives them the opportunity to help themselves to your stuff.

Most of them are decent workers. A fair amount of them have alcohol issues and will ask you to drop them off after work at a convenience store.

I've had a handful that were straight ripoff artists. Some will demand a full day's pay for less than a day. One not right in the head and was nothing but sabotage until the police were called (I'm glad they took him back to the center because I heard a few days later he stabbed someone).

"While I get what you are saying, meaning the demographics of plano as a whole, the demographics near downtown plano are young.  You've got UTD a few miles away, cityline to the south, and all the apartments around the downtown area itself, and the DART rail running through the area.  A lot more apartments under construction also, along with the redevelopment of the collen creek mall area, and the new DART silver line under construction directly connecting UTD to downtown plano.

Anyway I'm a middle aged guy myself, but if you walk around in downtown plano the demographics are young.  Already have a few bars and restaurants in the area that are pretty packed.  I thought they were trying to create something interesting with the now failed Hub Street but once it opened it felt more like they were aiming for a family / mature demographic rather than a younger demographic.  Covid put the final nail in their coffin but it wasn't going to be a big success anyway.

"Yes, completely different. Delta 8 is a natural cannabinoid found in cannabis. Spice/K2/synthetic is a synthetic compound designed to mimic THC. Spice users reported looooots of negative side effects, including death. As far as I am aware, no deaths have been directly linked to delta 8. There’s no conclusion science regarding whether delta 8 is safe, but it seems to be pretty close to cannabis.

The big danger, I think, is that delta 8 is a grey market and it’s not regulated. You just don’t know what manufacturers are putting into the product. I’ve never had a bad experience or heard of anyone having a bad experience with delta 8, but certainly some of the stuff in the shelves has less-than-ideal chemicals in it.

Anyone looking to use it should definitely research it and make their own conclusions about the safety of 1) delta 8 as a whole and 2) the individual product/manufacturer.

"CBD is legal.

Delta 8, which is cannabinoid that is very similar to delta 9 (the “normal” marijuana/cannabis), is also currently legal, due to a loophole in the fairly recent hemp bill that Texas passed.

Marijuana/cannabis is still illegal in Texas.

EDIT: FYI, though, delta 8 will still make you fail a drug test. Also, you run the risk of a police officer not knowing the difference and slamming you with a marijuana charge anyway. It’s a very goofy situation right now, you should still be discrete if you’re using delta 8. You’d ultimately succeed, I think, if you had to go to court, but that’s a huge pain in the as.

"Check out Addison, a lot of younger folks there and while you’d have a commute, it’d be a relatively short reverse commute. The trouble with living in Frisco, Plano etc. for someone in your position is that they’re generally bedroom communities. Not a lot of nightlife, but set up really well for families. For me that’s a selling point. When my wife and I got married we were 31. At the time, she owned a duplex in Plano. I said “no way do I want to live in Plano”, we sold and moved to North Dallas right next to Addison. This was great until we had kids, and guess what, now we are in Plano again since 2011.

That said, Plano’s continued urbanization is slowly making it less family-friendly. We are looking at other options to get out of here at some point in the next 3-5 years before the schools completely go to hell, crushing resale value.

"Seconding what they said. If you are making just under 6 figs your best best is uptown Dallas/North West Plano. They both depend on what you like though.

I chose Plano personally cause I really liked the vibe, but a few of my friends live in Uptown and it's always a great time when I hang with them.
