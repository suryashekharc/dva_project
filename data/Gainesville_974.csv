"The Gainesville Sun is available for free with a library card, here’s the article:

“The owners of more than 4,000 acres west of Gainesville say they have a vision for a ""grand plan"" that would lead to its own community with land set aside for environmental protection, a golf course and other amenities.

What they don't want: Sporadically built homes with little coordination, adding hundreds of new wells and septic systems.

More than 60 neighbors living close to the area on Wednesday evening gathered on the fifth-floor office at 5001 Celebration Pointe Ave. to learn about the proposed development of 4,068 acres, which includes land set aside for a new University of Florida golf course.

Residents filled the room, offering more questions than criticism. The stakeholders' workshop is a preliminary step in a long process, with little expectation that any Earth-moving equipment will be at work this year.

""We want to assure you that the family members that are part of this partnership have a great love for this land,"" said Gerry Dedenbach, executive vice president of CHW consultants. ""And they want to look at a long-term legacy that involves the restoration and the long-term outcomes consistent with the way most of us feel about land here in Alachua County.""

The property in question sits along Parker Road (Southwest 122nd Street), west of Haile Plantation, and south of Oakmont and Town of Tioga. Under current zoning, the owners, who are being referred to as ""the Lee family,"" have the ability to develop 813 homes with wells and septic tanks.

But that's not quite what is envisioned, Dedenbach said.

What the family does want, he said, is a master-planned community with amenities such as its own solar power generation, biking and walking paths, central water and sewer, police and fire stations and recreational amenities.

""I would think later this year, in the fall, that we would have concept (development) plans, he said.

It is the largest project suggested in Alachua County since Plum Creek, now Weyerhaeuser, proposed a plan for more than 40,000 acres in east Alachua County a decade ago. That project never moved forward, largely over environmental concerns for wetlands.

The Lee family has offered to donate 300 acres at the southeast corner, nearest Archer Road, for a new University of Florida golf course.

About two square miles would be set aside for conservation. That is about a third of the total 6-square miles in question.

Developers for several months have been conducting a ""special area study,"" evaluating the environment and species on the property.

Dedenbach added that 840 acres on the west side of the property will be set aside for a gopher tortoise preserve, along with a pedestrian pathway leading to Tioga. On the east side, a number of sinkholes will be included in an undeveloped north-south corridor.

After the environmental assessment is done, a special area plan will be put together in which development plans and requested zoning changes for the property. They hope to convince Gainesville and Alachua County to extend water and sewer services onto the property, which is not allowed there now.

""We can look at housing, and look at how market-rate housing, how workforce housing, how affordable housing might be designed into a holistically planned community,"" Dedenbach said. ""We can also look from the start at energy options for our property.""

He said the plan could also identify multi-modal transportation options for residents.

""Someplace that has the ability from the start to have vehicles because we own those, but then, bicycling, walking, alternative transportation means — whether it's golf carts or electric type vehicles — and we can do that from the start,"" Dedenbach said.

He added that the project could also incorporate composting and vegetative management practices to reduce the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers.

Demand for housing continues

Dedenbach said he looks forward to collaborating on the development, adding that it's very much needed for the number of people moving to the region.

""About 1,000 people a day move to the state of Florida, and annually that equates to like another Orlando happening here,"" he said.

Residents asked a wide range of questions and concerns, including how the project might impact traffic on Parker Road, the black bobcat population and the flight path of the Flying Ten Airport.

T.J. Frasier asked whether noise studies will be done on the development's impact on the airport and its approach.

""This a public-use aviation airport,"" she said. ""There is an obligation on the county's part to protect that airport.""

She said if a pilot had to make an emergency landing before the runway they may not make it safely if there are homes. ""So there is that increased risk around us,"" she said.

Dedenbach said the noise and other impacts of the project on the airport and its flight path would be reviewed in the special area plan process.

""This study (happening now) is really focused on the ecology and the ecosystem out there,"" he said.”",t2_34ec81hl,shotsofglitter,0,1648254432.0,0,t1_i24wg9j,i24wg9j,False,[deleted],t3_tnwu6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/tnwu6o/so_westside_is_getting_a_golf_course_and_eastside/,So Westside is getting a Golf Course and Eastside gets nothing... again?,/r/GNV/comments/tnwu6o/so_westside_is_getting_a_golf_course_and_eastside/i24wg9j/,4,r/GNV,0,4

"I really hope she finds her cat! My friend's cat escaped last year and was missing for about a week before we found her hiding in the bushes across the street.

I highly recommend actually going to the shelter to check for the cat. Another friend lost her cat and called the shelter to see if he was there. They said no, he didn't fit the description of any cats they had. She had a nagging feeling and went to check anyway...  sure enough, she found him at the county shelter.

Just a heads up though, we do have coyotes in the area and they eat outdoor cats (one even ran off with a small dog that was being walked by its owner in west Gainesville). I know people like to let their cats out, but they are so much safer indoors.

It's still something of a longshot since cats aren't as smell based as dogs for example, but that couldn't hurt at least.

Also, best time to search is at night with a flashlight. Shine it under cars and into nooks and crannies around the neighborhood and look for that cat eyeshine. Bringing a bag of treats and shaking it a bunch might also help.

"First thing to look at is your lease to see if it mentions anything about notice prior to the landlord accessing the premises.

If it says nothing, then you can ask the landlord to provide you written notice of the dates and times he will be on the property. Florida law requires “reasonable notice.” A vague window is not sufficient. The landlord must provide more detailed information. I’m linking the breakdown of the basics below.

[https://www.fdacs.gov/Consumer-Resources/Landlord-Tenant-Law-in-Florida](https://www.fdacs.gov/Consumer-Resources/Landlord-Tenant-Law-in-Florida)

This is from Nikki Fried’s office. And it’s a simple wording of the statute.

It was actually two people who got hit. One was a woman and the other was a man and his dog. My boyfriend and I were having beers at Boxcar and unfortunately witnessed the whole thing. The man got hit AFTER the woman and he rode the windshield for a good five seconds then rolled off. The dog stayed on the hood of the car after his owner (I’m assuming) rolled off. Then the driver made a u-turn and the dog wasn’t on it anymore. It was so freaking traumatic. We didn’t see the woman move ONCE. She was lying flat on the ground. The man who rode the windshield on the other hand was moving his legs and looked like he had more physical injuries. Pretty awful and graphic. I haven’t seen anything about this on the news.

and if the first one won't work with you, try another.  We had a lapse in insurance and my wife had to have some testing done, she ended up paying less in cash than she would have paid as her portion if insurance was involved.  That was just for the testing,  I don't know how you see the specialist for any less than like $750 per consult.

"November.   Realistically, if you qualify for HCA, you can't afford a plan that's worth affording.

Anything you can afford will have deductibles that you'll never reach, fees for every little routine visit and script, somehow actually cost you more for diagnostic testing than if you paid cash, and would cost you about $500/month for the privilege of getting no actual coverage unless you have a major, non-pre-existing emergency.

Unless you plan on having major surgery between now and November, it's better to wait, and even if you do, it's still probably better to wait because a lot of these co-pay plans disguised as insurance will have minimum waiting periods before they'll cover major expenses.

I suggest the more traditional American Insurance plan - have an apple a day.  Hopefully that gets you through to November, at which time you'll only be able to sign up, coverage won't kick in until Jan 1, but at least you can get yourself a real Florida Blue bronze/silver/gold plan that actually covers all your little routine stuff as well as the emergencies.

"Sorry for your sister, that really sucks man.

You were downvoted because it appears you mostly come to this sub to complain about Democrats, the vaccine, and liberal politics, using words like ""Libtards"" and a bunch of other played out rhetoric. 

New bar in town? ""Libtards are going to ruin it""  
Shooting? ""Libtards try to sweep it under the rug""  
Nursing home needs vaccines? ""Libtards who voted for Cuomo can eat shit""

That's not why the rest of us are here, man. We're just here to  discuss shit going on in our community, and it's unpleasant to deal with people who want to show up and yell ""Let's Go Brandon! BRAGHAHAHAH!"" when we are just trying to find out where to sign up for an Ultimate Frisbee league or find a lost pet. 

So when you say ""There needs to be a ton of awareness, yet I get downvoted because society is messed up"", it's pretty clear that you're not really aware of how toxic your comments can appear to others. Just tone down the rhetoric and answer someone as if you were sitting with them at a bar or in a group of friends.

"Drivers fucking suck? That’s a pretty big blanket statement. I’d argue the bigger issue is the unclear signage. I’m not specifically talking about depot park here, they may have accurate signage, but along the Hawthorne trail, for instance, the pedestrians/bikers have stop signs, suggesting that they should be stopping and where the trail crosses Waldo/Williston I believe, the drivers just get a flashing yellow light that automatically turns on when a biker or a pedestrian pulls up.

Floridas medical marijuana law requires card holders to see their weed doctor every 210 days to confirm that you are using the product properly and to answer any questions that you may have. The cost of this visit is $189 and is separate from the license. That’s another $75. Fine, whatever, take my money and give me my card. The funny part of this whole thing is the 210 day requirement.

210 x 2 = 420

"Hi! I went to the Releaf clinic over near 8th and Main to get mine. It was super easy, the guy was an actual doctor (he was older, so my guess is he retired and did this instead because they probably make bank doing it). He asked me about conditions I had that would qualify, talked about the history of medical MJ, and we talked dosage and preferred methods of use. He recommended me for it, and the state verified that I qualified with my medical records. I think as long as you have a documented history of issues that qualify, you’re good. 

But yeah, they make it as expensive and inconvenient as possible lol. My card is good for a year but every 9 months-ish I have to get doctor approval again (I see it as getting my prescription refilled? Lol). So it was about $275 initially, then $100 for the doctor visit to renew my recommendation, and then in a couple months I have to pay the state $75 to renew my card.

"They’re pretty straightforward. There’s some actual primary care physicians that are licensed, so if you’re looking for a doctor that can prescribe a medical card but also factor in and actually treat medical issues, check out Dr. Alex Kaye’s. 

If you’re just straight up looking for weed, then call up a dispensary or Google it. If you want a weed card better to go to the “weed doctor” or any similar advertisement. Most of the time the dispensary will have a doctor on staff so call them up and ask. If not, there are advertisements around town and such, but a quick Google search will give you the answer. 

It’s $100 for the initial appointment and $270 every 9 months for the “licensing fee” to the state of Florida. Every 9 months you need an appointment with your “doctor” that is a quick zoom call and $50 and they rewrite. So basically, it’s $370 the first 9 months, $320 every 9 months after. 

Dispensary prices vary, but there is always one running deals so find 2-3 you like the product at and cycle through the deals. Eights are like $40-$50 for top shelf but they run buy one get one free so it’s like $50 for a quarter. Distillates aren’t terribly priced either.

"I paid about $1500 in November 2020 for seamless aluminum gutters.  My house is about 2000 sq ft, but only just under 100 feet of gutter, which I don't think is a lot as we have some large gable ends that don't have gutters.  Also, of that $1500, about $500 was for leaf guards which are completely worth it if you have a lot of trees.  So the gutter itself was about $10 a linear foot (wasn't the cheapest, but wasn't the most expensive).  

They have an estimator tool on their site that gave me a decent idea of what I would be paying.  And it was pretty accurate probably off only by the fact that I had no idea what a valley shield was.

"The pyridoxine form of B6 causes nerve damage over long-term use with as little as 2mg a day.

*    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887233317301959

*    https://academic.oup.com/advances/article/12/5/1911/6257780

The Pyridoxine version of B6 actually cancels out the active form and gives the symptoms of B6 deficiency.

Many cheap multivitamins and supplements use Pyridoxine. You'll notice the more expensive vitamins purposely avoid it.

> *In the last decades, various cases of vitamin B6 induced poly-
neuropathy have been reported (Schaumburg et al., 1983; Morra et al., 1993; Dalton and Dalton, 1987). People chronically taking vitamin B6 supplements reported complaints such as pain in the extremities and muscle weakness. These complaints were reversible as they faded away after stopping the supplementation. Most often, these complaints were seen when taking mega doses (> 50 mg/day) of vitamin B6 for a longer period of time.* 

> ***However, recently, Lareb reported cases in which lower
doses (2 mg/day) of vitamin B6 gave the same complaints (Lareb,

"What's your end goal? To get medication?

Do you want to get diagnosed, or do you want to get ""diagnosed""? I have been trying to get an actual diagnosis for a while and I screwed myself over by forgetting about my appointment. I posted [here out of frustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/r53wel/i_forgot_about_my_psychiatry_apt_to_try_and_get/) after it happened. Working with someone that can actually diagnose you can be expensive and is time consuming to get an appointment for.

If you want someone to say, ""Yeah, that sounds like symptoms of ADHD, let's try this medication."" then I think you'll have better luck. I have not done this myself, but know someone that did. You just have to find a doctor willing to write a prescription based on just symptoms without a diagnosis. The problem I currently have is my doctor is very dismissive and seems to not believe that adults can have ADHD.

"If you've recovered from your awesome St. Paddy's activities and want a little bit of exercise, come and join us at Depot Park on Saturday morning for parkrun! Bring your lucky socks, don your green and come out for the Shamrock parkrun!

parkrun is a free (yes, free!), timed 5k weekly event that takes place every single Saturday morning. It's a worldwide event, started in 2004 in the UK, with events across 5 out of 7 continents, and 48 just in the USA alone! Everyone is welcome, no matter if you're young, old, fast, slow, novice or veteran! You can walk, you can run, or a combination of both. You can even bring your cute Doggos and Puppers (we call them ""Barkrunners"").  All we ask is that you register ahead of time at [parkrun.us](https://parkrun.us), and save the barcode they give you (save a  screenshot on your phone!) to be used on Saturday. 

Don't want to participate, but feel the need to do something awesome? Come be a volunteer! parkruns are all volunteer-based, and we can always use a hand. 

If you can't make it this weekend, no worries! We're there every single Saturday, rain or shine (okay, except *last* Saturday... but that was some crazy weather!)

"They pulled this BS with me when I was a student back in 2014. I had copies of the move in paperwork, as well as dated photos and a call/email log of times I contacted them to get issues resolved. The reason for the log was my unit was disgusting when I moved in and it took them a while of me hassling them to get it cleaned appropriately. When I moved out, they attempted to hold my deposit and charge me for carpet cleaning, etc. I skipped right passed the folks at Spyglass and took it to CMC management (I’m pretty sure that’s still the company that owns them). I didn’t leave them alone about it. I called every day, emailed several times per week until they realized I wasn’t giving up. With all the proof I had too, I think they eventually realized I had no reason to just let it go, I had my evidence.

I hope you have equitable documentation to what I did. Assuming you do, bother the hell out of them until they rectify the issue. Hell, even show up to their offices (respectfully ofc) with a file of your proof.

"I loved living at Spyglass apartments while I was there. The one issue I had ended up completely turning me against them though. 

The first week I moved in a major leak happened in the bathroom that flooded the whole apartment(I was away at class during this time). The brought water vacs in and sucked the water out of the carpets and then pulled them up and put fans under to dry them out. Great. Glad that's solved, we'll just ignore the fact that my super expensive electronics spent several hours drowning in an inch of water. I tried to contact the front office about the issue but they gave me the run around and when I was forwarded to management they wouldn't take my calls. Everything ended up being fine so I ended up dropping the issue. Rest of my time at Spyglass was great!

**Until I moved out.** I got a bill for 400 dollars because they had to replace carpets due to water damage that they caused. I was beyond pissed, and explained to them that it was their fault. They changed their story to say there was pet stains on the carpets, which was completely false, I do have a dog but they were never allowed in the bedrooms (only carpeted place in the apartment). Anyway, they suck. Would not live there again.

"Teastori or Tea Moment

Teastori has better tea overall, but I love Tea Moment and their owners are so sweet and recognize me every time I go in (even when it was peak pandemic with my mask on). I can tell they really care.

Whatever you do, do not go to Volcanic Sushi to get their boba tea. They may have changed it but when they first introduced it, it was really really bad.

I have tried most boba places in town; Kung Fu Tea isn't bad but I prefer to patronize the local stores personally. My friend really likes Frosty Fox but I've yet to find what I prefer from them. Bento used to have okay boba tea, not anymore. T-Yummi just opened and I'll give them a pass for their tea solely because I want to try it more before I say it's bad or good. Tea Bestea is good, but it's a bit out of the way for me so I haven't had it more than once or twice.

"Call Alachua Counry Social Services and go to their office located in the Health Department to fill out an application for financial assistance.

"To be fair, it is good advice to do whatever it takes to keep an eviction off your record.

OP was the one who didn't fully grasp the process, but u/GringoGrande does.

What will happen ""at 10am"" is OP will receive a Pay or Quit notice, also known as a 3 day notice.  OP then must pay the full amount owed within those 3 business days or the landlord will then begin eviction proceedings.  Once the proceeding has began, there is no reason for the landlord to stop, they pay for most of it up front and the back end usually isn't needed, as it's just a fee for the Sheriff to execute the writ - irrelevant if OP is gone but still leaves the lawsuit and eviction on their record.  

So if OP goes past the 3 days, which fortunately they won't because some friends fronted some money, even if they abandon the home during the eviction, the lawsuit will happen and the eviction will go on OP's record and OP's chances of renting at reasonable rates will be royally screwed.

and to clear up A LOT of misinformation above, after the 3 day notice, it takes 28 days to wrap the process up and get a writ of execution to the Sheriff to remove all persons from the premises.  

Do not count on being able to squat for 2-3 months, do not count on leaving before the completion of the eviction as a maneuver to escape the legal consequences.

Florida is a pro-landlord state.  Do NOT fuck around and find out.
