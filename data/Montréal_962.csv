"Ok just got my booster (had covid when I was originally scheduled to get it, so it's been delayed) and I feel like I experienced a microcosm of what is wrong with the healthcare system here: first, you walk in and someone points you down the hall to a set of chairs to wait. Then, someone else comes out to say it won't be long. All fine. Then when it's your turn, you go an sit in a chair for registration. This person does a few taps on the computer, confirms your name, etc. But this is where things start to quite obviously fall apart. The next two stations are ""evaluation"" and ""vaccination"" but you can't move on until both those stations are empty. So instead of being able to go answer the ""evaluation "" questions while the person ahead of you is getting vaccinated, you have to sit at the registration station for a while. THEN when the next two stations are ready, you go to the evaluation and answer a bunch of questions. You would think, since the vaccine station is empty, that this would be an opportunity for the vaccine perso. to start preparing the dose. Nope. First you have to be 100% finished with evaluation and then go to the vaccination station, where the nurse will then begin prepping the dose. In the end, it's fine, it didn't take that long, about 45 minutes from arrival to vaccine being administered, it's just in that time, a total of 3 people got the shot.

"The reason I ask is because I've had that ""anything is possible, life is your oyster"" feeling many times in my life in various places. I'm from Los Angeles and I had it there. I had it in Detroit.

You could maybe argue that housing prices had something to do with it, but A) Los Angeles was never cheap to begin with and B) Detroit is still cheap, yet neither of them feel the same to me.

I'd say a good range to have some choice is $900-$950. That's the price where most decent apartments start. And it only goes up from there.

"Shit, je n'arrive plus à retrouver la vidéo sur Youtube. Elle adressait spécifiquement les problèmes lorsqu'on fait du hummus.

Le plus gros problème est que les pois chiches dans les conserves ne sont pas suffisamment cuits pour faire un hummus soyeux et léger. Il faut pouvoir les écraser facilement entre le pouce et l'index et qu'il n'y ait pas de grumeaux.

Le second est qu'il faut ajouter l'huile d'olive à la toute fin en un filet et prendre son temps. Un peu comme pour monter une mayonnaise.  J'en mets aussi significativement plus qu'avant.

"There are so many factors to both sides of the equation (why rent was so cheap and why it has increased so much) that it's hard to pin it all down concisely. If you read through this post though there's lots of valuable insight.

I'd say that recently, Montrealer has gotten a lot more jobs that pay people in their mid to late 20s and early 30s more money than there had been in the recent past. Then factor in that across NA young professionals are choosing to stay in cities for longer, whereas previous generations had more people eventually ending up in the burbs.

Throw in the fact that a lot of apartments also got turned into AirBnBs a few years ago, taking hundreds of options out of the market and driving up demand.

And importantly, the system is also set up in a way that allows landlords to be greedy. I've heard of people accepting rent increases that are *way too* high simply because they aren't informed of their protections as a tenant in Quebec. Alternatively, it's also not uncommon to hear of people simply offering a landlord more money per month to guarantee they get a spot Nor is it uncommon for landlords to post a vacant apartment at the ""market rate"" even though it breaks the rules around how much they can increase the rent with a new tenant because they know they can find someone desperate enough to pay that amount and not that them to the TAL (fka Regie).",t2_j6utj,TheShuggieOtis,0,1648225923.0,0,t1_i230fv3,i230fv3,False,chaarro,t3_tnkomp,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/tnkomp/just_how_cheap_were_apartments_in_montreal/,Just how cheap were apartments in Montreal?,/r/montreal/comments/tnkomp/just_how_cheap_were_apartments_in_montreal/i230fv3/,4,r/montreal,0,4

Hi, it seems that your post is about Visiting Montreal. Unfortunately, due to the amount of posts of tourists, we had to remove it automatically. It will be reinserted if the amount of research in your post is acceptable (i.e. not only looking for recommendations).

If in a couple of hours your post has not been reinserted in the subreddit, you can post in the tourism sticky thread or edit the posts with actual research.

How to ask a tourist question:

- Mention what you like,
- Number of people, interests, budget, where in Montreal you're staying
- Method of transportation
- The *exact dates* of your vacation and the length
- A list, preferably a breakdown per day, of your schedule and we can help fill the void.

#Example of a good tourist post:

I'm visiting Montreal for 2 days between the 15th and 17th of July. We're two 30ish men, looking for something relaxing to do, we're staying at an hotel near Bonaventure station and we don't have a car.

So far we want to do:

The 15th:
 - Arriving at noon,
 - Beer and poutine on the afternoon near Parc Lafontaine,
 - Soccer game on the evening
 - More beer later on the night

The 16th:
 - Visit the Mont-Royal
 - The St-Joseph Oratory
 - I need recommendations for what do to during the evening near Mont-Royal / Where to eat for supper

The 17th:
 - Visit old port
 - Maybe visit X or Y... What's better to visit between both?
 - Departure at 17h00.

Thank you.

"rule of thumb in the 80's and 90's was ~$100 per room. so a 5 1/2 would be around $550. this was for decent to nice neighbourhoods. You could definitely find cheaper if you were not picky about where you lived or state of building or apartment. My 1st was in Villeray, a large 4 1/2, ground floor for $500 roughly 1200 sq ft,  (near corner Jarry and saint-dominique)  . being on ground floor means you hear the neighbours upstairs and in these attached row buildings, you can hear neighbours on left and right. I did not last long. I left after 18 months. 

I then moved downtown in a luxury building, I paid $1000 (sub let) for a 1 bedroom, but it was larger than my 4 and 1/2 was. It was also furnished, indoor parking and doorman, roughly 1500 sq ft.

"The legal system is slow and arduous to navigate.  There was a couple of cases a few years ago that pretty much nailed any ""annoyances"" are not worth a big settlement anymore, you cannot sue for ""100,000$"" because you feel you have been wrongly asked to leave.  It does not work like that in Quebec, you do not have punitive damages numbers like USA, the punitive damages will be minor like $200.  How much in lost wages, in wasted time, in lawyers will she have to pay to get that low amount of money?  

They offered a breastfeeding room, I am not saying what they did was right, I am for public breastfeeding, what I think is ludicrous is thinking the woman should sue as it will waste everyone's time.

IMO she could not even sue for ""shaming"" as she pretty much self-reported and made herself into a celebrity/icon.  

I will be happy if Eaton and the rent-a-cop went out and made an apology (maybe they did already, have not looked it up) but suing is IMO not worth anyone's time.

"The law is very much settled on this. Discriminating based on breastfeeding is legally considered discrimination based on sex. 

*While only British Columbia and Ontario have laws that explicitly protect breastfeeding as a right, the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on sex, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees “gender equality” under the law.*

https://www.kcyatlaw.ca/breastfeeding-duty-to-accommodate/

And in Quebec, case law establishes protection for women who breastfeed in public:

*In Quebec, breastfeeding in public is not covered by a specific law. But the courts have ruled that women can’t be prevented from breastfeeding in a public place such as a courtroom or a store.*

*This was the case a few years ago when a mother was asked to leave a furniture store because she was breastfeeding her baby. The judge ruled in favour of the woman and held that she couldn’t be stopped from nursing her baby in the store.*

*Discrimination based on sex*

*Québec’s Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms protects people against discrimination based on sex, age or religion, for example.*

*In the furniture store case, the judge ruled that, since breastfeeding is something only women can do, **stopping a woman from breastfeeding in a public place is discrimination based on sex**.*

Or you go right after your shift, exhausted and not having had time to shower and stuff.

Anyway, some people prefer it, but I really disliked working evenings lol

It takes some getting used to I guess, but essential stores have longer opening hours so it's not like you can't buy groceries after 5 or something like that.

"Ironically, I use public transit and walk many places. I only use cars or motorcycles for long distance and trips so you're preaching off choir.

I do not perceive a bias, between you and one other poster, there **is** a bias. There was no sidewalk, there was an alleyway. The discussion is also about responsibility. A pedestrian can have a higher responsibility if he disobeys simple safety laws, such as going on a leisurely walk in the middle of a highway. The same way if you dress your kid as a reindeer and send him off in the forest during hunting season, you're an irresponsible parent and failing your duty.

You know nothing of whether or not this was preventable as you do not know what happened. Unless, of course, we come back to your bias against cars that is looking more and more that if there wasn't any cars in the city, it could be preventable. The same way if there were no children, it wouldn't have happened.

"You're comparing apples and oranges. A baby drinking from their mothers breast is not quite the same as someone urinating or defecating in random places. 

I'm going to assume that you probably don't have children, but when a small child needs to eat, they need to eat. Making them wait just stresses them out and stresses mom out because she has an UNHAPPY baby. Your comment above says that this has nothing to do with eating, but it does. It's a 100% about eating because the breast is the baby's only source of nourishment... how is this not about eating?

There is really nothing disgusting or offensive about a child drinking breast milk (unlike urinating). Breasts are only offensive because of misogynistic views on the female body.

"You clearly have a massive bias against cars that skews your view but that's pretty typical of this sub. I never said all parties are equally responsible, I said all parties have responsibilities.

This is also not about people walking regardless of their age, it is about the parents seemingly failing their responsibility if the kid was unsupervised. You know, the whole mitigating risk piece. The laughable part in this is you are assuming what happened with no details of what actually happened other than a 4 year old was sent to the hospital with the picture of an suv at the entrance of an alleway. Hell, there is no mention even of a sidewalk but an alleway that is also a place for vehicle traffic.
This reminds me of the kid who was hit by a car last summer and everyone blamed speed but it turned out the person had an attack at the wheel.

I'll entertain this one second though. If I decide to walk in the middle of a highway, am I not presenting a danger to others by doing so? By your belief, I cannot be as walking is not a comparable danger to a car. The cars potentially hitting me are the true danger. Are all the evil mean cars on the highway the only ones with responsibility? Can responsibility not shift according to the actions one is taking, even without operating a motor vehicle? Something something about obeying laws for safety on all sides is involved (speed, not jaywalking, supervising and teaching children, not being distracted at the wheel, etc). At this point, I sense such a bias towards car that you'd probably answer yes, only the cars on the highway are responsible if they hit the pedestrian walking in the middle of it, right?",t2_4n96p,MrFluff,1,1648156924.0,0,t1_i1zerdl,i1zerdl,False,Academic-Comparison3,t3_tmgz9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/tmgz9i/outremont_un_enfant_de_quatre_ans_dans_un_état/,Outremont | Un enfant de quatre ans dans un état critique après une collision,/r/montreal/comments/tmgz9i/outremont_un_enfant_de_quatre_ans_dans_un_état/i1zerdl/,-2,r/montreal,0,-2

It sounds like you actually do realize how inherently dangerous cars can be, and I'm sure you're advocating for limiting their use in cities. After all, we wouldn't allow people to hunt in dense urban areas, would we? 

Now to your belief on all sides being responsible: When you do something that presents a danger to others, like drive a car, you have a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to mitigate that risk. Walking does not present a comparable danger to others, and so it is unreasonable to place the same accountability on people walking, no matter their age.

"Most of the yards I see are open/not fenced in their area so view isn't an issue or they're just out front. Frankly, it's a weird area where a bunch of people have lawn chairs on their front yard and seem to make every effort to be in the front of the yard closer to the road instead of the back yard even though the whole area is made of 10k sqft house lots everywhere. Space isn't the issue.

To me there's a difference in driving cautiously and parents literally expecting the road to be a playground for their children. I expect the occasional kid being stupid and crossing without looking, not kids looking at a car coming their way and intentionally stepping in front of it to make it brake or setting up hockey nets in the street and expecting cars to drive around them because they don't feel like moving it.

I grew up near a school and the motorists being the issue are usually the parents. I've nearly been hit a few times crossing at stop signs by impatient parents. My favourite is still the guy blowing a stop sign going 40 ish (there's a speed display sign there) in front of the school with 2 young kids in the backseat.

"1. For future reference and for god's sake write out i am not a lawyer vs your chosen abrev.
2. Something simple to understand, who ever this affected time was lost (3-4h) which equals money, I don't make $15.5/hr, like the sex troll on here, but even if I did what would it matter, this is not a discussion specific to any tax brackets, bottom line, majority of working class people taking a hit in their work schedule ain't spending that money in the economy, all propagated from a misconducted traffic operation, in itself a fault of the city. Simple fact 101: you got 3 legal options at the intersection with a 2 option sign it really ain't rocket science. Whether some morons think straight lane turn or right lane turn who the fuck cares, just put a fuckn proper sign for the three legal options your want the ants to follow, and if you change that same sign 3 times in 7 years, put up some thing that says new signal in what ever french term u want.
3. I have no problems with fines, implications are self explanatory, don't know where you got the impression I was against it as a revenue generation source of income for the city, my problem is justifying any/every operation as good revenue, that I don't agree with. That itself can be argued as tax bracket class type argument. I myself could've pissed on the 200$ ticket, but thats far from the point here.
4. Deep analytics: you looking at the first layer, even at that layer you missing 4 idling cop cars, court system + judge and prosector, I bet the judge don't make 15.5$ an hr like sex troll, then you are absolutely missing all the people's work schedules that this useless operation affected that ain't pumping money into the economy, other more valid and healthy streams of revenue into the city, because of that ticket or the time they lost going to court to contest not working.

>I don't believe direct democracy is a very good idea, but that doesn't mean there aren't alternatives to get involved in municipal politics.

I agree on that one, there has to be a balance, but good fuckn luck getting people involved. You prolly lose more time doing that than proving a point contesting or redditing.

After the Spanish Inquisition a lot of Jews went South to Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Libya, but some of those Jewish communities already existed. In Djerba, Tunisia, the main synagogue has a stone from the second Beit hsmikdash in it.

One of the reasons Moroccans still have such a strong attachment to Morocco is that during la Raffle, France demanded a list of all Jews in Morocco to serve them to the camps. The King of Morocco insisted that they were Moroccan citizens and refused to turn anyone over.

"> When there are abusive proceedings you have a right to claim damages. Yes I know a hard fought process.

IANAL so I don't know. But I would be willing to bet that this would not work. But feel free to speak with a lawyer about it.

> Analytically i would have to assess value with 6-8 cops on the beat plus equipment + prosecutor/judge from broken processes, as a very questionable source of revenue, especially considering it was a useless 2-3 hr police op. Fines bring in money thats fine, (pun intended), but justifying it from a possible broken system, is sweeping the crumbs under the rug, your non dyson vac didn't pick up.

First, Dyson is one of the most over rated brands out there. It's abilities to pick stuff up is irrelevant. Save yourself some money, buy a bagged Mielle instead if you want that sweet spot of quality and price.

With that out of the way, I am not necessarily justifying anything, merely pointing out the reality. Fines bring lots of money, money the city depends on. This means fines are not purely a method of managing behavior, but it is also an important part of the city budget and incentivizes operations like the one that got you. And it's an important part of the city budget because the city is not creative in ways of raising funds that doesn't involve fines/fees/taxes. 

> Probably all tickets that day, we are talking 6-8 cops on the beat with their cars on, equipment, on tax payers money, x amount of people who lost time and money getting pulled over who didn't spend money in the city, you are talking deep analytics with your assumptions it was profitable for the city.

Deep analytics:

First, the equipment are one time costs except I guess the paper and pens. But office supplies are dirt cheap, especially when bought in bulk. The expensive items like cruisers and radar guns etc, are not purchased for a ticket operation. It's just normal standard equipment that every police force has. So you can't really say that equipment contributed to the cost of running that operation.

SPVM Salaries:
https://spvm.qc.ca/upload/Carrieres/convention_policiers_2015-2021.pdf (page 11)

Traffic Fines:
https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/fines-penalties/fines

Looking at these documents, the average traffic violation fine is $200, and the top salary for a police officer is $82,521/year. We can round that to say $40/hr.

So now you have 8 cops running a ticketing op. That's $320/hr. But if the average traffic violation fine is $200, then those 8 cops just need to issue 2 tickets an hour to cover their salaries with some left over.

But if there was no ticket operation, those 8 cops would still be costing the city $320/hr, and they might doing things that don't generate revenue for the city like arresting criminals or directing traffic or being active members of their community in an attempt to build trust. 

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-hunts-for-more-cash-by-raising-fines-on-bylaw-violations-1.5373204

According to this, the city collected $177 million in fines in 2019.

So yeah, I'm going to make the assumption that EVERY ticket operation makes more money than the money spent on the operation and the costs of dealing with the few people who actually try to contest it.

And I will argue that the operation effectively cost the city nothing at all, since everything involved in that operation has costs that would have existed just by virtue of police doing work.

> We need to view and vote on how our money is spent at the city. I am ok with fines just not money grabs, its overall effects are detrimental.

I don't believe direct democracy is a very good idea, but that doesn't mean there aren't alternatives to get involved in municipal politics.

You can pester your local city councilor, and you can even have a podium with city hall:

Getting more involved in municipal politics is always a good thing.

"What I try to teach people is that even though we live in a light-polluted city (and we can't see a whole lot of stars), we can still see a lot:

* Moon
* Planets with the naked eye (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn)
* International Space Station
* Rotation of Earth in real-time (sunrise/sunset)
* take photos of stars with your smartphone

So, yes, seeing stars with your naked eye in the city isn't great because of light pollution here in the city. But that shouldn't turn people off from astronomy.

In fact, some concepts are easier to teach in the city. For instance, with buildings being static reference points, it's easier to demonstrate the rotation of Earth as stars, planets, and the Moon move in relation to it.

I do workshops, events, and tours in the city, if you're interested in learning more! (putting together my workshops schedule today, in fact):

"There's definitely a lot of tension between the two in Montréal. The historic Ashkenazi community, especially in CSL and VSL where much sephardic jews live, in Montreal is primarily anglophone and much wealthier and older overall than the sephardic community. The sephardic community immigrated much more recently (like the 80s-present as opposed to before/after WWII), so the ashkenazi own a lot more property and run most of the public and private organizations (schools, synagogues, restaurants). The ashkenazi community however has also been gutted, as most of their young people moved to Toronto for better job prospects for anglophones in post-referendum Québec.

Currently the Jews in Western MTL (I'm kind of excluding the Hasidim in Outremont/mile end as they are a separate community with their own tensions) are mostly poorer, more religious, francophone sephardim who don't have enough seats in their synogogues, housing shortages, etc. The older, more secular, anglophone ashkenazi community definitely look down on them, but not in a violent way in kind of a passive aggressive way, by doing things like not allowing sephardic services in their giant synogogues with low attendance, not teaching sephardic practices or about sephardic culture in their schools despite more and more students coming from these communities, etc.

The tension between the two communities very much exists and the ashkenazi community has a cultural privilege that they are certainly working to maintain.",t2_di2jdpjy,therpian,0,1648134732.0,0,t1_i1xtwky,i1xtwky,False,ZAHKHIZ,t3_tlo6p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/tlo6p3/montreals_moroccan_jews/,Montreal's Moroccan Jews,/r/montreal/comments/tlo6p3/montreals_moroccan_jews/i1xtwky/,3,r/montreal,0,3

"To sum it up for u, this thread is about how the city mismanages traffic regulations (arguable for case in point), then how our tax paying dollars are wasted on a useless police traffic operation to regulate citizens who happen to break the rules that have been changed 3 times in 7 years and still isn't correct (3 option intersection with a 2 option sign).  Of which cops get the paper work wrong. Prosecutors at municipal court knows police paper work is wrong but was still willing to take my money, but bluffs to insinuate she is interested in the evidence in my majestic shiny laptop, which she gives 2 shits about and drops case 3 seconds later, however she doesn't provide proper paper work of any sort of proof that any of this happened. Meanwhile the great community has so far chimed in that:

1. It is ok for useless and inappropriate police operations to bring in revenue to the city from otherwise law abiding hard working citizens, because it brings in GOOD well needed money.
2. There is nothing we as citizens can do about any bureaucratic broken processes, we just got to take it, be an ostrich with your head in the ground.
3. As a civil servant it is ok to get paid to NOT do your job. Again just take our tax dollars.
4. It is ok to go into municipal court, where your case is dropped but you cant prove shit, maybe just a selfie with the security guard and the only thing you can do is hope they get the paper work right the third 3rd fuckn time even though the first 2 time they didn't.
5. A turn from a mandatory straight lane after overtaking a turning lane vs just going straight when its your turn is a safer traffic practice, according to bobs driving school.

"Good neighbours lol good luck, not in metropolitan area, very rare.  I never said no noise is transmitted, what I was attempting to convey is  you take X' by X' section of wood framing regardless of the assembly (even including concrete topping what ever 1""-2"") and the same in structural concrete (obviously not concrete topping),  you are going to always get better sound dampening where there is more density. You are referring to impact noise (IIC) vs air borne (STC). Usually you will hear more higher frequency transmission with concrete, but compare it to older style homes in plateau with 24"" O.C joists, anything less than 2"" of sub floor you are going to hear what sounds like a bass drum regardless of decoupling ceilings, walls or insulation in assembly when you have people who walk like elephants, you wont hear that at all in concrete structure. Also older building codes of 12' spans for 10""  x 3"" thick 24"" o.c  joists (mandrels) regardless of bridging or thickness of subfloor you will hear floor deflection when you have neighbours who walk like elephants, same deflection in concrete will be unnoticeable at way larger spans. But with density conduction of noise is more noticeable (higher freq) but still compared to wood with no underlay like MLV, it will be equally or more disturbing.  I know you are using it as a metaphor, but if u hear a pin drop in 6-8"" of reinforced structural concrete, something is wrong. Sound proofing cannot be solely attacked from one side or the other side, or in between (if wood), in a floor/wall assembly, it truly is only achieved with a combined effort. On top nothing can be proofed for shitty inconsiderate neighbours, except the  many inches of thick concrete all around them a la asylum style setting.

"For the most part both were separated for centuries. In the early years of the Israeli state there were some tensions between Ashkenazi Jews (lived in Western/Eastern Europe) and Sephardic Jews (lived in Southern Europe/North Africa) + Mizrahi Jews (lived in the Middle East). But they were pretty minor and they’re basically non existent anymore. I’d say there is absolutely no question of one being superior for like 99.9% of people. Obviously there are cultural differences since each group lived in different places for such a long time. There are also other groups of Jews but genetic studies have shown they have a common ancestry with the groups I cited previously. There’s Bukharan Jews who lived in Central Asia and there’s Ethiopian Jews as well as other smaller communities like in India.

"The only good KFC experience I've had in the past couple years was in Whistler. Last time I went to KFC was on the south shore of Montreal. Oh boy, I even called MAPAQ so they would inspect the restaurant. I've never had something that disgusting at a fast food restaurant.

There were black spots on the chicken, like cooked blood or something. The macaroni salad was all watery and the macaroni was so overcooked, the texture was like jello. The “gravy” was the worst. Do you remember the good ol' days when the gravy was thick and tasty? This sauce was cold, liquid, tasted like old, dirty dish water. The fried chicken was soft and looked like it was left on the hot stove all day. It almost made me puke.

I rarely eat fried chicken but when I do, I always go to IGA. It is way better than KFC.

"Most Moroccan Jews left Morocco during/after WWII due to intense antisemitism in Morocco and Zionism efforts from Israel. At that time they mostly went to France or Israel.

Since then many of the ones in Israel have moved to Montreal because they tend to know French (in addition to a bajillion other languages).

Most of them live in CSL and they tend to be pretty insular unless they've gone secular. Trying their food is pretty difficult because the way the kosher certification works makes it very difficult to open a restaurant, it's mostly the same as non-Jewish Moroccan food though.

"Yeah, no doubt. You pushed that smartphone photography thing farther than is reasonable :D

Thanks for not getting defensive!

> Canon EOS Rebel T4i

Exactly the kind of thing I was talking about. Just need a tripod and a remote shutter now... and then you can try pushing _that_ beyond it's limits!

As for 30 second exposure, that's where remote shutter comes in. For one, just pushing the release button will shake the camera. But it also goes well with ""bulb mode"", which the T4 also has. It basically keeps the shutter open for as long as you press it. So with the remote you can set it to anything you like.

I'd do a shot with the planned exposure just before, to make sure the lighting is ok and then you should have it.

Oh yes, and RAW, it really _really_ opens up possibilities in post, especially with shots where you have varying lights like that.",t2_3u4t,farox,0,1648086138.0,0,t1_i1vlhsq,i1vlhsq,False,trevorkjorlien,t3_tkjhi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/tkjhi2/international_space_station_flying_over_mile_end/,"International Space Station flying over Mile End Water Tower (March 22, 2022)",/r/montreal/comments/tkjhi2/international_space_station_flying_over_mile_end/i1vlhsq/,2,r/montreal,0,2

"So at 1400 for a 2 bedroom you're looking at roughly 800 square feet of unit. Assuming this is a Plex. That sells for low end 300-400 a Square foot unrenovated. That's a value between 240k and 320k.

Your per square foot renovation for a complete strip to update insulation, windows and sound proofing is going to be around 100-120/sqft. That gives you an exit value of 420-520 a square foot or 335k- 416000. At the low end, thats a mortgage payment of 1635 and high end of value 2031 per month. Just for mortgage. 

Property taxes are gonna be around 3k a year or 250/month. Insurance around 125/month.

"Yo! Thanks for the tips. I appreciate that you I can make better shots.

A few things:

I readily admit this isn't my best shot. This part of town is super hard to shoot in and get a long exposure of the ISS flyover. So many streetlights everywhere.

Framing is a similar issue. It's a really difficult part of town to get a shot because of the streetlights, and you have to line up the shot with the direction the Space Station is moving.

I had to do some heavy editing to get this out, and it feels muddy. But still, worth sharing.

\--

For equipment, I actually recently got a Canon EOS Rebel T4i (a gift from a friend who wasn't using it anymore). Although I'm up for learning to take ISS shots with it, the limitation is that it has a 30 second exposure time (that shot above was \~150 seconds). 

Plus: I'm really into teaching folks how to get the most out of their smartphones with astronomy. You can get pretty far!

Here's 2 more that I think are better examples:

You have the patience to prepare, the eye for the right shot, but your pictures could come out so much better with a little better gear and a bit more work on the technical (vs. the artistic) side of things.

I hope you don't mind that I share some thoughts...

First of all, try to get it all in with the shot. Straight lines, composition, lighting etc. The better it is in the actual shot, the more freedom you have in post.

Please, get a DSLR and a tripod. It doesn't have to be an expensive camera. I shot really cool pictures with a Pentax K5-II, which you should be able to get for cheap used now. (I switched to Sony, but still love Pentax because of how weather proof they are)

Get a sturdy tripod, a remote shutter and shot raw.
