"It's seriously gotten to be a daily problem out in western Loudoun, bordering Clarke County. These shitheads are out there every single day, all day if the weather is nice, and the only times we get a break from the noise is when it's pouring or during that snowstorm earlier this month. 

It feels like at least a tenth of pickups I see are now significantly louder than even freight trucks, and small suburbs like Round Hill, Hamilton, and Purcellville now even have issues with lifeless tools dumping their entire paycheck into their ugly-ass Honda Civics (or shit equivalent) and fucking up what few roadways we have by going out of their way to be as loud and obstructing of traffic as they possibly can, especially on weekends.

This is becoming a bigger problem across the entire state and has been for well over a year now, especially thanks to social media in bringing like-minds together and spreading awareness that this bullshit is functionally legal. At the rate these insecure living problems are growing in number and establishing communities, I pretty much expect to hear it constantly by mid-summer. It's not just kids, too. A lot of them are middle aged midlife crisis types that did stuff like buying the loudest motorcycle they could, so there's generally several in every fucking neighborhood.

It echoes in the countryside on a clear day so badly that you're sometimes hearing multiple people flaring their engine at once, like they're fucking yodeling at one another or something.

"You mentioned in the text that you would've done the registration yourself. Can you still do that? That would be the quickest, safest way to nip this in the bud. I think if you have a bill of sale and other paperwork, it's time to just go and register it yourself at the DMV. Yes this costs more money, but it's likely to be the quickest way to get settled with the state. You could then request a refund from the dealer for the registration fee you paid them (don't let them tell you to go with their third-party service - you paid the dealer, the dealer owes you for services not provided; they can go after their subcontractor if they wish). If the dealer doesn't refund you, take them to small claims court. 

As for driving the car currently, you legally shouldn't, but you're likely going to be ok. Don't do anything illegal and get pulled over - cops aren't likely to run your (invalid) plates unless you get pulled over. You're not likely to get in long-term legal trouble for this - all of your actions have been in good faith, you should own the car but the dealer is dropping the ball - but it could take months to shake out, and you may get 'inconvenienced.' And by inconvenienced, I mean 'driving around in an unregistered car with the title not in your name could lead to your car getting impounded.'

"This article claims the county makes 15:1 taxes to incentives on data centers and close to half a billion in taxes, which is far and above the 9.5:1 and $300+ million I saw a couple years ago, but it’s a dot gov site.

https://biz.loudoun.gov/datacenteralley/

*These* articles are really interesting because I didn’t even *think* of the impact the chip shortage has on tax revenue! For those unaware, most of the tax on data centers is on the computer equipment they’re constantly replacing and less so on the land they’re occupying. This is why tax incentives are important to make sure an existing data center doesn’t up and move to a cheaper county and leave their empty husk behind.

"I think a lot of people really underestimate what some people make around here.  A couple making $250k+ pre-tax isn't that much of a stretch and can easily afford to buy a $700k-$800k home.  The biggest issue is that inventory is really low right now and home builders are supply and labor limited so they're focusing on their highest margin products (5000+ sq ft homes on 1/4 acre lots, Luxury condos and luxury townhomes).  Everyone is competing over a small pool of existing homes and the very fact that home prices and mortgage rates have gone up is limiting the number of people willing to sell and take risk buying a new place given that they've 'locked in' at low rates and prices here.

Gen Y and Z are settling down and looking to start families, but also shaped by the great recession and not looking to stretch their budgets on McMansions and happy to get a 2000-2500 sq ft home somewhere in the beltway that has some green space.  Getting a jumbo mortgage at 4.25% is something they can carry easily here and if a recession hits in a few years they'll be happy to roll that to something lower or just sell and move up then before their oldest kid starts elementary school.",t2_4bgq2,ObservationalHumor,0,1648276131.0,0,t1_i25ycs3,i25ycs3,False,classandvirtue,t3_tnyobj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/tnyobj/housing/,Housing,/r/nova/comments/tnyobj/housing/i25ycs3/,4,r/nova,0,4

"But people can only afford the cost of housing (both rents and house prices) going up so much. You cannot have the cost of housing going up to infinity while most people do not get raises that beat 2% inflation let alone the high.

More and more people are being priced out rentals let alone buying a house. and what happens when a large percentage of the general public is desperate to get, or maintain basic necessities? Revolutions, revolts, and strikes take place, populism gains popularity. 


There was a reason why in the late 19th and early 20th century there was so much social unrest. There was a huge income inequality, large employers controlled the government, most people were making barely enough to exist.

And that is why during that time there were the [Colorado Labor wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Labor_Wars), ,[the coal wars ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_Wars), and especially [the Pullman Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullman_Strike).

The background of the Pullman strike was that George Pullman founded the company town of Pullman, Illinois for workers to build his railcars. He made the houses look nice outside but were no better, and some would say worse than standard housing of that era. He also sold workers everything they needed, and would purposely trap people in debt to him to keep them working for him and not somebody else.

But when the panic of 1893 happened, George Pullman cut pay, increased working hours, and did not lower rent to the houses his workers were not allowed to purchase nor utilities who he conveniently had a local monopoly on as well.

Because of the Pullman Company's refusal to bargain, the American Railway Union (founded by former presidential candidate Eugene Debs) called for a strike, then a boycott on Pullman trains, causing Railway workers to refuse to work with any trains carrying his cars, shutting down most rail traffic west of Detroit.

In the end, the federal government shut down the strike, 70 workers gave their lives to the cause, but the Pullman company was forced to sell their residential holdings.



You can agree or disagree with the tactics,  you can argue if it's worth it or not, but you cannot argue that incidents like these only really happen when populations get desperate and feel backed into a corner.

Housing being unobtainable isn't an ""it is what it is"" type of thing, atleast long term. People will fight back. If we are lucky it is through politicians. Otherwise it may be through armed militias.

There is a reason Americas government didn't fall during the great depression like so many others did, and that is FDR's far left reforms made revolution not worth the risk for the American public.

"Yeah, that's the disconnect people have.  Houses are not all that expensive.  The *land* the houses are on is what is expensive.  Ask any NoVa homeowner to look up the rebuild cost of their home on their homeowner's policy and then compare that with the estimated value of their home on Redfin, etc. and see what a massive difference there is.  

This is so much worse of a problem than a shortage of affordable houses because governments can step in and compel builders to build smaller, more affordable homes if there is affordable land to build them on.

There just isn't, not within a reasonable driving distance anyway.

Whats more likely is they unknowingly sold a car they didnt ever have the title to sell, whoever handled their purchase of the car probably forgot to also get the title. In this case you dont have to do anything crazy. The DMV will print you a new title when they determine the original has been permanently lost or destroyed.

Either way when its all said and done I would leave that dealership an terrible review on yelp lol

"I wish affordable housing can work out but I cannot see it working a wide scale to cover the whole of Nova. The zoning alone is will cause a lot of problems the biggest of which would be parking. Some places require for every unit there needs to be two parking spots and that lot needs to be able to smoothly transition to a main road and have emergency access. That alone limits developers from making more affordable housing because the value of the land (parking lot) is worth a lot and causes taxes and mantenance costs while not producing income and taking up valuable space. With limited availability in land and with costs of everything going up along with shortages of blue collar workers and supplies new development will cost tax papers heavily. Some states such spend upwards $300,000 per year on each family on affordable housing which only increases taxes leading more people to the poverty line.

"Affordable housing programs are hardly affordable for the individuals that qualify. The max incomes accepted for these programs are still paying over 30% of their net income towards rent alone, which is very high. Sure, they may not be paying market rate, but truly affordable and financially comfortable it is not. Rent control/affordable housing also limits the amount of rent a landlord takes in which means buildings are not upkept or the quality of housing decreases and leaves vulnerable populations in vulnerable situations. It may help in the short term but it's not a sustainable solution. 

Home prices decrease when there is a surplus of housing. There is not a surplus of housing here due to zoning restrictions, lack of qualified laborers at the national level, and many places here, like Arlington, being 100% developed aka, all land is accounted for. The only way to get more surplus here is to change zoning regulations to allow more multiple family structures.

Its pretty simple if you aren't getting a large income from a high pay job or skill than move away from Nova. Every year many people from all over the world with high skill sets and high pay move to Nova which is one of the most important and richest places in the nation.

"As someone who lived in a mobile home for three years in college, a 16x74 singlewide that we bought new, it is a hundred times better than ""living in a custom van"".  Even living in a Class A motorhome doesn't even compare.

It was over 1000 sq. ft. inside and while the furnishings and construction quality weren't luxurious, they were at least as good as what you would find in anything below a luxury motorhome.  

Contrary to the assertion made above, they can be and often are moved.  My parents moved mine two states away after I graduated and lived in it themselves while their new house was being built.  It is just a pain in the ass and expensive so it is not worth doing just to hunt for cheaper lot rent.

"Probably too good to be true. ~~If it's Old Town like the description seems to imply, that sounds suspiciously low for the area~~. They're asking you to pay an application fee before you can even view the property at all? That's definitely a scam then. They would definitely let you get a tour of the place to help you decide/persuade you, even if it's not the exact unit you'd be leasing.

If it's a building that's run by a management company, I would just call them directly from the info on their site/Google, independent of whatever it says on Craigslist, to ask them about it. Most likely they're going to tell you it's not their ad it sounds like.

**EDIT:** okay I'm avoiding work and looked into it more; it looks like this is at Park Place Condos over near Fairlington. This wouldn't be that spicy of a price for that area. That said, it's still far too suspicious to me. [I found the unit is pending sale on Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2500-N-Van-Dorn-St-APT-1215-Alexandria-VA-22302/192148579_zpid/), with these exact same pictures. There's a *super slim* chance someone is buying this with the intent of immediately renting the unit upon sale, but I wouldn't bank on it.

"Yes, same model - you have a membership card and many things are dramatically less expensive. Other things work out about the same, so it requires some choosiness.

We found it very useful for basics and for savings, especially with kids. But you have to think differently. Bulk quantities mean that you need storage space, and some ability to plan. 

It's not about how much pasta or guacamole you need today or this week, it's more about what you will need for the next month. So you have to think about what will keep, what will spoil, what you can reasonably be expected to use up, etc. 

Personally I am generally an impulse shopper and tend to decide each day what I'm in the mood for, or what looks good that day. For basic staples, though, BJ's/Costco can help. If you know you're pretty much always going to need paper towels, diapers, ketchup, cereal, beer, frozen shrimp, Advil, tortillas, cheese, ground beef, etc., and you have storage space? You will definitely save money and occasionally find something great. 

But it's not for every household. If you find it inconvenient to have to buy two half-gallon jugs of, say, mustard, it may not be right for you. But if you live in a house where it's cool to have a dozen boxes of Kraft mac and cheese, or a one-pound can of pork & beans, it's great.",t2_ylyqn,RonPalancik,0,1648241307.0,0,t1_i24327p,i24327p,False,Rickbox,t3_tnnoo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/tnnoo4/best_supermarkets_in_the_area/,Best supermarkets in the area?,/r/nova/comments/tnnoo4/best_supermarkets_in_the_area/i24327p/,1,r/nova,0,1

"No HOA is a huge selling point for me. My last 2 houses had an HOA and both were such a pain in the ass. You pay them a lot of money and, oftentimes, don't see much for it. 

This, I'm sure, differs from neighborhood to neighborhood. But my experiences with them have all been negative. Had some old lady with the HOA scare my wife because she was trying to take photos of an invisible crack under one of my steps in the backyard. Another time I received approval from them to do an aluminum wrap around the wood banister and framing on my front stoop. They approved the color and everything. After the work was done, I get a letter from the HOA attorney saying that my screen door doesn't match the aluminum wrap and it will need to be replaced or pay a $600 fine.

We had to argue about crap like this all the time and never actually violated any standards or paid any fines. And it's always this lawyered up, heavy handed nonsense you get certified mail from the attorney even on a first notice. Got a first notice one time in mid-December talking about getting my siding pressure washed in 30 days or pay $600. Like, okay that's happening. You gotta take time out of your day, call them up and tell them you'll do it in spring like a normal human being.

"In Reston communities typically belong to two HOAs, the Reston association and then their cluster HOA.

The Reston Association is $700 a year and that covers things like pools, parks, the trails, the design standards board (sometimes annoying but keeps the area looking good), and so on. The RA pretty much acts like a hybrid of a Town board and an HOA. There's a lot of amenities here and it's completely worth it IMO. 

My cluster HOA is $300 a quarter and that covers lawn service, snow removal, tree maintenance, garbage pickup, and maintenance for the community space at the center of the cluster. IMO the trash & lawn service makes the fee completely worth it.

Regarding the other aspects of the HOA - I haven't had any issues with the Reston design board. I made some exterior changes and they approved them in a timely manner and didnt make a fuss about it. I can see how if I were trying to do something non-standard to my house that the review board would have been an obstacle, but my experience has been fine so far.

"I think there has been a confluence of factors that led to our current situation and deregulation is one of them. Two others, among many, spring to mind. In the shorter term, Fed policy has had us living with near-0% interest rates for almost a decade and a half. When debt costs nothing, people will indulge in it. In the longer term, my parents and grandparents lived their financial lives in the afterglow of WWII. While Europe and Japan spent decades cleaning up rubble, the US redirected its war-time manufacturing engine toward making anything and everything for the rest of the world. That lucky positioning made the US incredibly wealthy over the next half century and beyond and that wealth was reasonably well distributed. We're past that Goldie Locks period, though. We've moved on into a different period in which we are legitimately competing against emerging economic super powers like China. Our leaders have not done a great job managing that competition.

EDIT: I think this is actually a good place to clarify my frustration with this topic. We essentially have two choices: (1) we can throw our hands up, say we're not getting the same shake as our parents and grandparents, and watch our situation deteriorate further; or (2) we can admit that we face headwinds that didn't exist for previous generations and innovate our way through them.

"Yes, the listing cites it a few times.

HOAs are curious beasts. Beneficially HOA fees can pay for management of things like contractors caring for play areas, dog parks, leaf collections, pools. I've heard of them working out insurance coverage for tree damage, and negotiating  reduced or covering cable co fees. Regulatorily, the HOA may have rules that are maintaining the development's social feel, home appearances, even historical value. The HOA fees can vary, but last I've heard a friend was paying $400/month.

If the development is too small the HOA will have no legal status, and typically rely on an overarching citizen association for city/county/state representation. In this case, major issues (drainage, infrastructure, safety, etc.) are escalated on behalf of home owners. Same path for escalation and support via citizens associations for major issues exists with a HOA that has legal status.

However, the worst case, HOAs are a collection of bureaucratic minded control freaks. When the HOA has legal status they can legally enforce their fines, HOA rules, including petty complaints and whims.

And this housing inflation is one of the more transparent results. A key commodity that everyone needs is now getting more and more difficult to acquire.

"It's definitely a challenge. If your overall area can sustain the increase, you don't have a lot of leverage by threatening to move out and they can get a tenant in quickly that will pay the new cost.

You can try to see what is possible. Look at what similar units in the complex are going for now. Are they bringing you to the ""new"" level or are you being priced higher? Often the community manager can hide behind the argument of their numbers being dictated by corporate, so while you can try to plead on a personal level and discuss your immediate financial situation, there's no guarantee. 

While you mention not having the money to move, what would the cost difference for the year be between finding a new place (so new application fees), the move, and possibly a lower rent vs. staying with the 20% increase? I really hate suggesting use of credit because that can cause long term problems by kicking the cost down the road. Making up numbers but if moving results in $5k upfront and lower rent for the year vs staying and the yearly cost being 7k spread over 12 months, you need to decide what is most sustainable for you.

It's scary. Seeing these stories makes me worried about what my rent offer will be when it comes time. And your situation is indicative of the issue where people push hard for change once it starts to impact them, but it's typically too late to solve the situation. And that's not to say you didn't care or haven't worked towards rent control before, but for the majority of people, there's still plenty of ""not my problem until it's my problem"" unfortunately.

"I'm so Fed Up with housing right now. It's disgusting.

What, you don't want to buy a house that was valued at $300K less in 2020 than it is today? For reals, you don't like that? Better act quick. Houses are selling like hotcakes. Tax assessments? What are those? They mean nothing... it's just something random the county does, ignore it--that's old data..."" Seriously, so just ignore common sense.. Gotcha... My bad. What was I thinking. And sorry, but you know who wanted all these stupid ""walkable urban communities"" full of over-priced apartments and restaurants--and now they've gotten older and want a house and can't find one--because you told the world you wanted all this other crap. Oh, and let's not forget the big push to make housing affordable--that's worked super well. Now, ""would-be"" single-family homeowners can't buy a house because their aren't any single family homes to buy!!!!!!!!!!--but if you want a townhome, from yet another new townhome development that's being built you can maybe afford one of those. So, I can buy a townhome in Ashburn for $800K or I can buy an okay single family home for $900K.... when 2 years ago, that same townhome was $400K and that same single home was $650K... and don't even look at 5 years ago, you'll throw up. I'm sorry, what am I missing here??And then, Fannie Mae, National Realtors, they're all like, oh yeah, interest rates increases aren't going to matter.

"Before I get to my actual response, let me stipulate a couple of things: (1) I'm as disposable as anyone else; (2) my kids will be as susceptible to being gouged as anyone else's kids; (3) you're right about a lot of what you say; (4) I understand the frustration because I share it. 

What I take issue with is that you aren't proposing any sensible solution or what we do going forward. The answer isn't to stamp our feet and talk about how much easier our parents had it or how some shitty one story ranch in Fairfax isn't worth what someone paid for it. Those things are already a foregone conclusion. They are what they are. Times change and economies changes. 

You want life around here to be better and more equitable for a larger portion of the population? My suggestion would be to take a hard look at the problems that we face, and I mean a HARD look, and think about what you'd do to address them. Then, start looking around at which politicians align with your values and throw your votes at them.

In my view, the only sensible way to bring down housing prices here will be to remove restrictive zoning laws and allow significantly more construction. On the other hand, simply saying ""houses should be cheaper"" is an absolute non-starter. What would that even look like? Legally capping home costs? Play that one out in your mind. Then instead of 10 bids on every house, you'd have 200 and it would be little more than a lottery system.",t2_7gnxf,KarlMalownz,0,1648228215.0,0,t1_i236dzj,i236dzj,False,spielnicht,t3_tnmh8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/tnmh8c/housing_is_getting_way_ridiculous/,Housing is getting way ridiculous.,/r/nova/comments/tnmh8c/housing_is_getting_way_ridiculous/i236dzj/,6,r/nova,0,6

I watched that shit ramp up in real time over the last decade right when the new round of gentrification and build up in DC started taking more and more of the old neighborhoods and housing.

Entire populations of our capitol city were told to just go kick rocks, sorry no jobs for you, no pay close to a living wage, but oh sure you can still make my subway sandwich you just have to have a two hour commute. Now the shit is expanding into the suburbs, you think you aren't disposable too? Doing some crucial job and making so much money that you won't get gouged too? Your kids won't get gouged?

Just look at what happened with student loans over the past 50 years, my old man paid for college driving a fucking 7up truck and could still get married and get his phd later on a single salary in Minneapolis! You don't see how that's like a fucking fairy tale now and why that hurts the basic standard of living you enjoy here? It's not just about you getting rich, it's about is our society stable, do enough people feel safe and like they've got a piece of the pie to not go into extremes politically because they can't find answers to why their lives suck and they're in pain.

Everyone needs a house, food, clean water, and warmth. When we make the systems that dole this shit out increasingly painful and difficult that's when things go bad in history. I've got a master's degree, I'm finally out of debt after emergency surgery, I took a field that would let me serve my country and hopefully save lives: a house feels straight up unattainable unless I rob a casino.

"In my experience, based on the food I buy at the locations I go to:

Safeway - produce 2/5 bakery 3/5 price 2/5

More expensive than others but the bakery normally has a few items that aren't terrible.

Giant - varies wildly from location to location. Price 3/5

You may have the worst grocery store or one that is totally fine. No consistency.

Harris teeter - produce 3/5 bakery 4/5 price 3/5

Decent bread and cookies. Produce tends to be better than giant/Safeway. Prices are in line with what's expected

Hmart - produce 5/5 bakery (not what you think of with a bakery)/5 price 5/5

Cheap and great produce with insane variety. Good luck getting most traditional American groceries. But the best place to get veggies.

Wegmans - produce 4/5 bakery 2/5 price 1/5

Some house brand items are very cheap, but nearly everything else is more expensive for no reason. They try really hard to push premade/prepped items that so overpriced. Example an uncooked premade pizza is $20, it's cheaper to order a pizza at that price.

Also the bakery is a sea of frozen items for fresh made prices. I don't get the love.

Whole foods -produce 5/5 bakery 3/5 price 1 or 3/5

Great produce. The bakery has declined in recent years. The reputation of whole paycheck is entirely based on what you buy. Thier premade food is highly overpriced, but they have the cheapest milk, free range eggs and veggies/bakery bread are well priced.

"On the reasons DC picked a stupid gauge I have no idea. It might be related to the politics around building the metro but that is all I can think of.

Standards within the JR system are very helpful with speeding up construction because they can partly reuse existing designs and procedures. They are also always working on improving different parts of the JR network which makes it so the people working on the network are always skilled up. Building rolling stock continuously makes it so JR gets a few new trains every year and the people who build them retain the skills required to build them.

Problem with American infrastructure projects is they are super corrupt. In the rest of the world the objective of a infrastructure project is primarily to solve a problem.
