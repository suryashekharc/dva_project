Welcome. One thing to know is that northwestern students get free rides on the 201 bus so along that route is an easy place to start for housing. If you’re planning to live in Chicago you should look along or at an easy transfer to the red line or the purple express which are the trains in and out of Chicago. The purple express only runs during commuting hours though so if you think you’ll have late nights or other weird hours then the red is your best bet. Another place to look in Chicago is Lakeview. It is a nice area to live for students. The purple makes it faster than places that are technically closer (Rogers Park/Edgewater) and there are a lot of student stuff around bc of Loyola University.

Welcome to Evanston! I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay here. This is a friendly suburb with great little shops/cafes and of course the lake to explore.

You have good public transportation at your convenience with the L and buses and there's the Metra. There are major grocery stores and some nice smaller markets as well.

"Illinois is what is known as an ""all party consent State"" which mean all parties involved must be aware of the recording.  According to the EFF: [""if your cell phone or recording device is in plain view, your open audio recording puts the officer on notice and thus their consent might be implied.""](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/you-have-first-amendment-right-record-police)   also: ""Police officers exercising their official duties in public do not have any reasonable expectation of privacy.""

That being said, you **CANNOT** record where there is a ***reasonable expectation of privacy***, such as inside a Police Station or on a phone call.    [Under the surreptitious exception to the eavesdropping law, it is illegal to secretly record an officer.

"If you want some diner food in an old school breakfast joint, try Shermain Grill. It’s about as authentic as it gets in terms of a window into the diner of the past in Evanston. Gritty and cheap. 

If you have a car, you should make a trek north a bit to the Mar’s Cheese Castle. It’s not as cool as it used to be when it was in a series of grunged out shacks along the interstate, but it’s still awesome. They redid it and it’s quite glorious. You can spend half a day there looking at weird food, tasting cheese, and having lunch in their bar.

You could also go to the Renaissance Faire in Bristol WI (up near the Cheese Castle) if you’ve never been to one of those. I don’t know how it compares to other faire of its ilk, but I always have a blast there. There is a unicorn. Just saying.

Already mentioned, the Bahai Temple is worth a look. The building is mind-blowing and seems so out of place. It has nice, relaxing gardens and you can go on a short historical tour of it too (at least you used to be able to).

I’d echo Candlelite for pizza, but wouldn’t limit yourself to it. It’s kind of old school in it’s décor and style too. Cozy.

Indiana Dunes park along Lake Michigan is pretty cool to check out. Giant piles of sand and stuff!

This rose garden in Evanston is neat. A co-worker of mine used to go sleep there playing hooky from work sometimes. https://www.cityofevanston.org/government/departments/parks-recreation-community-services/parks/merrick-rose-garden

We have a lighthouse too. https://www.us-lighthouses.com/grosse-point-lighthouse

This is between Evanston and Skokie to the West. http://sculpturepark.org

Montrose Park/Harbor (15 min south of Evanston in Chicago) is where I spend a lot of my time in the summer. Nice beach, decent restaurant on the lake/beach there called The Dock. Their food is decent, but it’s the scene to go for. Feels like you’re at some tropical destination (no palm trees). They have music most evenings.

There is paddle board and maybe kayak rentals there too and a really cool birb sanctuary. You can hang out on the lakeside near the sanctuary and near the actual harbor and watch people, the lake, and boat shenanigans.

"One general tip when it comes to navigating - the lake == east.  Outside of cell phones, almost everything is on a grid (except for a few wavy streets based of pre-colonization paths), 800 in address numbers == 1 mile, there's a relatively major street every half mile (this breaks down as you go further north, and it intensifies as you get into Chicago), and all movement and locations are relative to the lake.

Just in case your phone dies or something - just try to keep track of the lake and you'll be golden.  It gets a bit tricky sometimes if your getting off the el at an unfamiliar stop, but if you're lost, find the lake and just do the math.

Also, the El is usually the best way to get around unless you're trying to get to The Loop (downtown Chicago) or Kenosha (Wisconsin), then you want to take the Metra (way nicer than the El but it's more expensive, you pay more for longer trips on the Metra, and there are much fewer stops on Metra lines - also you often need to buy a ticket to ride the Metra or have cash to pay the ticket taker).

"Walker Bros is the best.

We should also be clear Michigan is not really within ""day trip"" distance.  It's super beautiful, but I just looked it up and it's a 3 hour drive if I left right now.  6 hours there and back...

We go to Whitewater Lake a lot, but just because my father-in-law and his siblings have a lake house there we can use - even that's farther than I'd go if I had to drive back the same day.

One other idea - there are a lot of nature preserves in northeastern Illinois!  The Grove in Glenview, Emily Oaks in the city, and you've gotta go to Middlefork Savanna (apparently it's in Lake Forest), which is extra special because it's what Evanston and most of Chicagoland probably would be like 250 years ago.

My wife and best friend both separately got food poisoning from Celtic Knot...just putting that out there...

Here are the places I'd go in Evanston:

The Lucky Platter (suuuuper cool sorta classed up Americana diner)

Dave's Rock Shop - they sell rocks, fossil, and they've got a little free museum in the basement!  It's also been around for decades - I remember visiting their old location across the street when I was in preschool in the 1980's!

Bookends and Beginnings - totally my happy place.  I haven't seen their new expanded layout yet, but at its core it's an indie bookshop in an alley, and the people working there are super nice and have great taste

The bird sanctuary at the southeastern tip of the main Northwestern campus

The downtown Farmer's Market on Saturday mornings

If you rent bikes, there's the bike path along the Evanston River (warning, the further south you get it smells more and more like shit because of that sewage treatment plant at Howard and McCormick)

Continuing on the river bike path - on the west/north side of the river as you get near Green Bay Road there's Ladd Arboretum and the sculpture park.  It's a cool place to spot birds and animals - jays, hawks, turtles, pretty sure I saw a beaver there once

Same area, Windy City Garden Center is a seasonal shop in this parking lot that's really cool!  They'll be selling garden stuff in June, but they sell pumpkins in Autumn and Christmas trees in December.  I love that place.

The Skokie Lagoons - beautiful hiking/biking trails, or you could rent some kayaks, it's fun for fishing, there's a mating pair of bald eagles there you might see!  That leads onto

The Botanic Gardens - absolutely incredible, world class acres and acres of gardens!  It only costs money if you drive there.

There are outdoor concerts at Ravinia (near the gardens, also in Highland Park, it's got its own Metra stop) - mainly aimed at an older audience, they have some excellent classical music, and I feel like I've been a super random assortment of shows there: Blues Traveler, the B-52s, Crosby Stills and Nash...but yeah, get lawn seats and bring a picnic, that's the only way to do it.

So many lovely restaurants in Evanston, there is a whole FB group dedicated to Evanston restaurants and shops called ""Support Evanston Restaurants""...lots of the restaurants on Main, Dempster and downtown have outdoor seating in summer.  Fabulous breakfasts abound...Cupitol, Le Peep, Ovo Frito, Frida's, Lucky Platter, Mid-Kitchen, Found, Peckish Pig, Farmhouse, Prairie Moon...so many.

Cinema closed during COVID and plans are being made for it to come back, but not likely before you are here. However, there are ""Movies in the Park"" programs all summer, NU's Block Cinema, Ethel Barber theater, and lots of live music here, particularly at Evanston SPACE.   Otherwise, Metra can take you north for an evening picnic at Ravinia (train drops you off and picks you up right at the entrance) or Metra/CTA south to Chicago where there are so many theaters and venues I can't even list them all here.

For pizza, Giordano's and Lou Malnati's serve up typical Chicago deep dish. Union Square has a nice beer garden out back if you'd rather check out Detroit Style. For the penultimate Chicago experience, take the El some evening down to Lincoln Park to Chicago Pizza and Ovengrinder, be prepared to wait but it is a charming place within walking distance of the (free!) Lincoln Park Zoo.

Divvy is common here for bike rentals. An Evanston is crazy walkable.

June won't be insanely hot and the water in Lake Michigan might not be warm enough for a long swim, but you will find people swimming here at many of the [Evanston beaches.](https://www.cityofevanston.org/government/departments/parks-recreation-community-services/lakefront-and-beaches)  Picnicking at the beach in the evening in Evanston is wonderful and relaxed. I don't know if Dempster Beach is going to restart boat rentals this year (suspended because of COVID) but I hope so!

There are usually lots of [fairs, and outdoor concerts, and art shows](https://www.cityofevanston.org/residents/parks-rec) in Evanston but COVID has messed up the schedules a little bit. In June, you might be able to catch Evanston's Juneteenth Celebration (June 19) and enjoy some BBQ and Strawberry Soda. Follow [Evanston Made](https://evanstonmade.org/) (the art collective) to keep up with any art events that are taking place.  Also [Artist Book House](https://artistsbookhouse.org/).  

Drop by the Evanston History Center to pick up some information about a walking tour, or just walk the neighborhoods. There are lots of little nooks and crannies to discover. Shakespeare's Garden and Dearborn Observatory at NU Campus, Lighthouse Beach, Dave's Down to Earth Rock Shop, Nice Lena's, Stumble & Relish, Ten Thousand Villages...there are some bars, & restaurants on Howard Street (besides Peckish Pig) that are amazing, like Ward 8, Good To Go Jamaican. Central Street has some nice restaurants too, but I don't stray up there much. I'm also a big fan of YoFresh--a tiny hole-in-the-wall frozen yogurt shop on the south end of Chicago ave, as well as Soul & Smoke which has some ""to die for' BBQ on Evanston's west side. Comfort Desserts on Dempster (next to the famous vegetarian Blind Faith Cafe), is a newish place for amazing desserts. And then down the street is Frio Gelato, which is across from the new Evanston Pour.

"More thoughts:

There are a number of very cool murals that have popped up over the last 5-10 years.  Mostly they're under train viaducts but some are on building walls too.  Seriously, just drive around and see how many you can find. I'm sure I haven't even seen all of them.  In fact, one of the older ones was designed by my dad.  It's under the train tracks on Greenleaf just west of Chicago Avenue near Nichols Middle School.  He and an assistant traced it out and then on a weekend the neighborhood came out and he had people fill in sections with colors he designated like a paint by numbers.  Then he and the assistant cleaned it up and added shading.  It's kinda cheesy but it shows that specific neighborhood and how diverse we are.  Of course it's not in great shape any more but it's been there for probably 20 years. 

Mid Kitchen has good breakfasts.

Evanston doesn't have a movie theater anymore because of the pandemic but Wilmette Theatre in the small downtown Wilmette is very cute and could use the support.  They only have 2 screens and have a good mix of mainstream and smaller films.",t2_3r5y4,spejampar,0,1643997908.0,0,t1_hvla2hl,hvla2hl,True,matthewvvose,t3_skbkxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/skbkxj/evanston_summer_trip/,Evanston summer trip,/r/evanston/comments/skbkxj/evanston_summer_trip/hvla2hl/,4,r/evanston,0,4
"Check out the lakefront!  It starts at South Blvd (just north of the cemetery on the chicago side) and goes all the way up to Lighthouse beach.  You should be able to walk up the entire length.

Further north along the lakeshore in Wilmette is Bahai Temple.  The most beautiful of all of the Bahai temples through the world and also their World HQ.  Gillson Beach/Park in Wilmette  (across from the Bahai Temple) is also a great spot.

"Adding a few more things on the excellent suggestions so far.

> Where is good for breakfast? (because American breakfasts are the best!)

I want to second the suggestion for Walker Brothers. They are *exceptional* and not to be missed and a short ride from downtown Evanston. Another gem in Western Evanston is [Sarkis Cafe](https://cafesarkis.com/) for an amazing omelette (or breakfast sandwich). It's more of a 15 minute ride away from the lake-side downtown.

> Are there any cinemas nearby?

There was, in the middle of town, but it closed due to Covid. It's very much missed. What I'd recommend is, Covid-permitting, go to Chicago to see an Improv/comedy show at [Second City](https://www.secondcity.com/).

> Is there anything in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana we should do on a day trip?

Absolutely but it depends on what you want to do. In June, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin is a wonderful destination. Good food and lots to see and do in the area, especially if you like boating.

> What's a good option to try Chicago-style pizza?

I can add beyond Lou Malnati's (first choice for me!) and Giordanos in Evanston, that, if you're in Chicago proper, find the original Unos on 29 E Ohio St, Chicago, IL 60611 or Due's Pizza 619 Wabash. These are not the chain version, but the original locations which has a different recipe. This is where Chicago pizza was invented.

> Are there any bike rental places we should use?

Divvy works great! You might want to buy a helmet.

> Anything we should know about the weather at that time of year?

Carry a backpack and travel with a coat and raingear. Weather in Chicago can change drastically between cold and warm, wet and dry.

**Local restaurants**:

When I travel, I like to go to places that can only be had wherever I end up going. I'll choose that over a chain every time. Here's some places in the area worth considering a visit that you can't get anywhere else:

* [Kabul House](https://www.kabulhouse.com/) For some amazing one-of-a-kind Afghani cuisine. This place exists nowhere else. Get the kabobs and some of their black cardamom tea.

* [Pita Inn](https://pita-inn.com/) Local well-known Lebanese-style schwarma, pita, etc in nearby Skokie. 20 minute ride from downtown and they deliver to Evanston. If you like this kind of food don't want to travel or wait, you could instead head to go to another local-only place [Habibi In](https://www.habibiin.com/) right on Church street in downtown Evanston.

* [Cafe Coralie](https://www.bestfrenchpastries.com/) local French-style cafe with tasty croissants and a great selection of macarons.

* Two more Evanston-only places that you could visit include [Buffalo Joes](https://www.buffalojoesevanston.com/) for chicken wings (spicy, greasy, and  goood!) and [Hecky's barbeque](https://www.heckys.com/).

* Finally, as a final Evanston-only choice, there's a wonderful vegetarian/vegan place that's unique to Evanston right in the Dempster area called [Blind Faith Cafe](https://www.blindfaithcafe.com/). Great salads and vegetarian dishes. The peanut butter chocolate cake is unique.",t2_8jrrj,0hypothesis,0,1643994353.0,0,t1_hvl0b4y,hvl0b4y,True,matthewvvose,t3_skbkxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/skbkxj/evanston_summer_trip/,Evanston summer trip,/r/evanston/comments/skbkxj/evanston_summer_trip/hvl0b4y/,11,r/evanston,0,11

"I’m assuming you’re talking about rest days from going to Chicago so mostly I’d say go to the beach for a bit and then check out Northwestern. The Evanston page of Atlas Obscura has it pretty well covered in terms of oddities. If you’re tired of Chicago and Evanston, close places that are easy car trips are the Bahai Temple and Botanic Garden, also in June, Ravinia should have a fun concert to attend. Basically you can bring a picnic and you eat on the grass while a concert is going on. Fun times.

"For most food options outside of the pizza, I would take the 20-30 minute drive into the city.  Having recently moved here from Chicago, we have found local Evanston places that we love but Chicago is a world class food destination and you'd really be doing a disservice if you didn't do a mini-food tour of the city.  I could go into recommendations there, but that would be a long and winding sidetracked post.

Pizza will draw a heated debate, but the two most touristy/""popular"" pizza destinations are Giordano's and Lou Malnati's - (stuffed and deep dish pizza respectfully) both have outposts in Evanston.

If you are up for a roadtrip, downtown Milwaukee is \~90 minute drive or you can take the Amtrak that will drop you right downtown.  Tons of shops, bars, restaurants it has a very different feel to either Evanston or Chicago and would be great to spend a day up there.

"I’ve done some research into this, and I’ll try to be straightforward/not emotion driven.

Most of the “panhandlers” or people you see around Evanston are not actually homeless. It’s mostly a mix of people who live in mental rehabilitation centers around the area or who come up via public transit from the city.

The overwhelming majority of people who deal with mental illness are not violent or threatening. Most of the people you see out and about aren’t harmful. But with that said, there are multiple documented incidences of harassment and theft by some of these individuals. For some residents, that’s not concerning and for some people it is. The question then becomes, what does the city of Evanston do in these cases? That seems like more of an open question, but (in my opinion) one that hasn’t always been solved in a way that those who commit these crimes are held accountable or prevented from committing further crimes in the community.",t2_is0zxx22,etownbound22,0,1643676947.0,0,t1_hv2joug,hv2joug,True,[deleted],t3_she1if,https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/she1if/the_amount_of_weirdos_in_evanston_is_eye_opening/,The amount of weirdos in Evanston is eye opening,/r/evanston/comments/she1if/the_amount_of_weirdos_in_evanston_is_eye_opening/hv2joug/,10,r/evanston,0,10

Mostly ideal matching social needs (not all wants), space, and affordability.

Walking distance to trains 18 hole golf course, coffee, bar/restaurants, I watch Big10 football so I like the stadium nearby. beach is bike able. New hockey rink is great, very close to other necessities.I work from home so being able to walk to lunch/coffee options if I want to be lazy is critical. I hear the K-6 schools are great too. 

Is it Lakeview quality bars? No. The bar/restaurant aspect of liquor licenses plus early closing kills almost all sense of real coolness. The lighting is universally too high, the low dining space universally too large. There are no truly cool places to have a cocktail  in Evanston as a result. It needs more patio bars and rooftops for this demo (COMIDA- do better with your roof).

Andersonville has a cooler bar scene and might be preferable if you’re pre-kid to pre-k. This city serves more to beer drinkers and diners. 

The access to DT Evanston is about right. I plan to buy a moped to make the better Evanston things feel closer and more fun. Specifically the handful of decent bar-like establishments: La principal, sketchbook, five and dime, tapville, temperance, and maybe stack/folded

"My wife and I moved to Evanston from Chicago about two years before our first child and we're really happy about that decision.  Other friends and stayed in the city until their first child was nearing elementary school age and it just seemed unnecessary, because they moved to Evanston anyway. So they bought a condo and lived in it for four years before moving north. (I'm not a big fan of moving or of real estate transaction costs, so I'm glad we came here earlier.)

We don't go to the city as often as we did before kids, but it's never been too much of a hassle, including on weeknights. Depending on where we're going we will drive, take transit, or even bike to places in Rogers Park. When taking transit we will sometimes take a Lyft home, or we will time our departure to catch a Metra train. 

Evanston nightlife is not wild, but it would be a mistake to say that it doesn't exist. The restaurant scene here is great. Most neighborhoods have at least a few walkable options for dining out.

I don't think there's a bad school in Evanston. Some will say that there are better schools just north of here, but keep in mind that Evanston has a more socioeconomically diverse population, so some of the kids are coming from more challenging backgrounds and may have some hurdles to overcome that tour average kid in, say, Wilmette does not face. 

We lived for four years in south Evanston, and have been in north Evanston for the last two. Although they are somewhat different, we love both areas.

Two families on my block moved here in 2020 to escape the “cramped” city.

This area has a great collection of young families, parks, etc.  I was also on the west coast before moving here, and partied it up.  Evanston’s party scene is nowhere near that, but as a parent you won’t miss it as much.

"I wouldn't exactly describe anything going on here as ""nightlife,"" but there are a bunch of pretty good restaurants and a variety of places to get a drink. I've never found a bar here that had a character I'd want to spend much time in, but I also don't really look for that anymore.

There's one good venue, [Space](https://www.evanstonspace.com/), that books a lot of smaller/quieter shows and is also a stop on a sort of elder indie circuit. They also run a great outdoor concert series in the summer that's a lot of fun and gets some bigger artists. 

South Evanston (south of Dempster or so) is more affordable, funkier, more mixed economically and racially. That's probably where you're already seeing reasonably priced starters. East of Asbury or so it's also very accessible to Metra & CTA. As somebody else said, if I'm going out in the city I just stay down there after work (back when I went someplace). I wouldn't say it feels disconnected from the city, more like a quiet corner of it that retains a lot of the upsides of urban living (transit, walkable/bikeable densities, a variety of neighborhood scale stuff).

"If nightlife is a priority I would stay in the city. My husband and I were in a similar situation when I was pregnant; we were living in Downtown Chicago at the time.

We chose Evanston. I like it for the relative safety and polite neighbors around town, and parks but other than that it's been really disappointing. It's expensive and doesn't feel like a good value. The city isn't always great about removing snow, everything closes earlier than we are used to. We have found popular food places, like Soul and Smoke or Tomate,  to be hit or miss (highly inconsistent and that doesn't typically fly at most places in the city)...I also don't think the schools are that great (compared to most CPS schools, they are amazing...but that's a huge caveat). Also, if you're a person of color please beware: Evanston is segregated similarly to Chicago. We had heard it was like a multiracial Mecca and that just has not been the case.

"This sounds a lot like me one year ago when I was making the decision between Evanston and staying in Rogers Park.

Things close early here, for sure. But I have two kids and stopped drinking last year so the lack of nightlife doesn't usually impact me. But the quality of restaurants is pretty impressive, imo. I'm addicted to Union Squared Pizza. Soul & Smoke BBQ is among the best I've ever encountered... Anywhere. The bakeries around are stupid good and it's a wonder I haven't developed diabetes yet.

My daughter has grown to love her school. And she's gained some independence that likely wouldn't have been offered to her if we still lived in Chicago. I can see her school from our window.

My toddler aged son has parks to play at every 1000 feet, it seems. He's more energized and engaged here compared to our time in the city. 

The Metra is a block away. The CTA's a bit further but still walkable.

In short, I think if I was single I may not be as impressed with Evanston. But married, kids, all that jazz... I love it here. I still get the lake and the city life as often as I want it.

ETA: I drive about the same as I did in the city— maybe a tad less. I only really drive my son to daycare (and we were already doing that when we lived in Rogers Park) and to the grocery store.

"You live at 1570 Oak? This is the exact thing that happened to me and I had to go to the Evanston Police station and talk to the cops. They literally just called the police, told the cops to interview random tenants, and I'm not even sure if they caught the guy. It was traumatizing, I was on the Metra back from work and this random number called me, and it was the f\*cking Evanston Police and they said ""I was under investigation"". I obviously went to the Police Department right away and the two cops (thank god) were extremely friendly and told me what was going on. I never received any apology whatsoever from Wesley Realty.  And yeah, for the entirety I lived at that building, only one of the two elevators worked, my neighbor was selling hard drugs and blasting rap EVERY day, I couldn't sleep normally for the entire year, AND he would knock on my door continuously asking money for food after I repeatedly told him to get on Food Stamps. I sent over 10 different messages to Wesley about this and they never responded.

I had one vagrant walk into my apartment about 8 months ago when I forgot to lock my door and had to pull out my gun; he was delerious.

"Honestly, Group Fox was pretty good about making sure our apartment was taken care of and our maintenance guy was timely and super nice. Also, lots of freebies and building community events. Oh, and no size restriction on pets. A couple of breed restrictions for dogs, though. 

But some pros and cons existed that had less to do with management and more to do with things technically out of their control.

Pros: elevator building (you can fit bulky furniture in it if you try), indoor heated garage (for extra $), laundry room with lots of machines, an unofficial ""giveaway"" corner in the garage, rooftop grill/patio/garden (watched the solar eclipse from there!) Also, close to lots of shops, restaurants, and public transit. 

Cons: Heat and A/C units are built in to the apartment, but that meant electric heating, which is super expensive.

The apartments in the building were not all that big. Cozy, but comfortable, sure. Still way too expensive (for me) for that amount of space, though.

I just checked their website out of curiosity - they won't even tell you what they charge for rent up front... lol...

Also, if you can afford it and think it's a good move, go for it. I know Evanston is expensive in general.

Evanston does allow smoking on premises in limited instances:

>The Evanston Clean Air Act prohibits smoking of any kind in places that serve food or beverages.  Additionally, if sampling or smoking of tobacco products will take place on the premises, the code calls for 25 feet of distance from any door, open window, ventilation system, etc.  Typically, this means the establishment would need to be a stand alone business and not be in a multi-use structure.

"🆘 Without cat fosters, there is no rescue. Fostering is simple, rewarding, and you literally save lives! Cats and kittens are euthanised at open access and high kill shelters, unless there are foster homes for them. Please be the difference and consider fostering a cat! We need the community to work together as there is limited space at city shelters and unfortunately, without licensed rescues and their fosters, there is no rescue for the ones left behind. 

WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO SAVE CATS! Cats are NOT indefinitely located at shelters, there is simply not enough room, especially at open access and high kill shelters. The majority of cat rescues are completely foster home based. If a cat is saved, it’s because a rescue with a foster stepped in. That’s right— all the shelter cats are depending on YOU!

We currently are trying to place healthy adult cats, cats and kittens who need varying degrees of medical attention, moms taking care of their kittens, and shy cats who need a patient foster. There is a cat for every person, whether you work full time or stay home, and all experience levels are welcome! We will find the perfect fit for you and support you throughout the process. 

If you are interested in fostering a cat, fill out our intake survey at www.felinesofchicago.org/foster.html to pair you to one of our 25+ partnered and licensed cat rescues in Illinois. 

You may also email us via felinesofchicago@gmail.com. This survey is for placement purposes only— no commitment yet, but it’s Step 1! 


Be sure to check your Spam box (email) and if you do not hear from us within 24-48hrs, please reach out again (you can even PM me here!)

Our survey matches you with a rescue that is the best fit for you based on your location, the rescue’s vet location, transportation needs, experience, and time commitment (as well the rescue’s intake status!). Once are matched to a rescue, you’ll complete their foster application. We are with you every step of the way to ensure your application is processed and that approval is expedited. 

ALL VET NEEDS ARE COMPLETELY PAID FOR THROUGH THE RESCUES VET. 

The life you save, will change yours! 

About Us: Felines of Chicago is a local 501c3 organisation which provides around the clock foster support, community resources and education, in addition to being a professional liaison to our partnered rescues. We additionally assist with community TNR (Trap-Neuter-Release/Rescue). Please visit our website at www.felinesofchicago.org to learn more!


Commonly Asked Questions:

I don't have a car, can I still foster? 

YES! We can often arrange transportation if you are unable to drive or take an Uber. 

I have a resident cat/dog/other pet, can I still foster? 

YES! Our rescues (depending on the situation) usually require resident cats to be vaccinated and spayed/neutered. You’ll need to be able to separate your foster from your resident cats in a different room for about a week or so and then slowly introduce your foster. A bathroom is ideal, as are bedrooms or large walk in closets. 

I have never had a cat before, can I still foster? 

YES! We will pair you with a low maintenance kitty that best suits your level of experience 🐈‍⬛ 

I work full time, can I still foster? 

YES! Some cats just need a place to sleep, eat, chill out and have some loving when you get home!

I will need to travel out of town, can I still foster? 

YES! Let us know at least week ahead of time and we will help coordinate care for your foster if you need assistance. 

Are foster cats indoor only?

Yes, unless supervised for enrichment such as on a catio. Unfortunately, cats who free roam are likely to be hit by cars, get injured by other animals (and abused or even stolen by humans), and contract incurable & often deadly diseases which are otherwise preventable.

How long do I foster?

This depends from case to case. We recommend being prepared to for at least a 4-8 week commitment, however there are shorter and longer time frames. We also have a need for emergency stays that are short term, however we really need some longer (1-2 months) fosters as well! 

Are supplies provided? 

Depends on the rescue. We are also usually able to supply donations for whom fostering would pose a financial barrier. If you are in need of some supplies, we can likely find some for you but generally fosters are expected to provide food + bowls (ceramic is best), litter-box + litter, toys/enrichment and a soft place to sleep. Carriers may or may not be borrowed, but we recommend purchasing a hard carrier. We also run a Facebook group for free cat supplies in the community of Chicago and greater suburbs. 


Our partnered cat rescues are Homeward Bound and thus the majority of cats rescued are from Chicago area and the State of Illinois, open access shelters. We also assist with TNR and community rehoming cases. When we are able, we also assist with cats displaced in natural disasters and in high kill shelters from different regions of the United States. At the current moment, animal controls in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas are ALL asking us for help.

"The properties are all privately owned and charge insane amounts of rent.  I know 2 long time small business owners who gave up after years of trying to make it work.  Opening a Retail business is CRAZY EXPENSIVE and the only ones that can afford it right now are chains or ones owned/subsidized by large corporations.

I just read that BRAMER ANIMAL HOSPITAL sold to a large Investment Company that owns hundreds of other Vets.  They pay top dollar for established businesses where the owner may be looking to retire.  Far more than any up and coming Vet could pay.

The only instance I am aware of where the City actually was able to influence something was with Trader Joes.  Someone there knew there was going to be an upcoming shuffle of property ownership and they literally cold-called Trader Joes to see if they would be interested.  TJ had not even considered it, but when presented with the options, they jumped on it.

When the Whole Foods across from Jewel on Chicago Ave closed, all the residents proposed all sorts of things, including -as usual- a Bowling Alley.  Anything but a Liquor Store.   But the property is privately owned.  A Business that was a Liquor Store would generate more tax revenue than an empty lot and the owners of the property wanted as much as they could get for it.  So we got a Liquor Store.  At the public meetings, BINNY's owner promised it would be so much more than ""just a liquor store"".

"I like Lou’s and Giordano’s; those locations are Downtown Evanston staples and Chicago traditions.  I’ve been eating those pizzas for years.  I imagine the attraction is for visiting Northwestern families to try Chicago style deep dish. 

There are fewer small restaurants than there used to be, but there’s multiple Asian cuisine restaurants (though I suppose some do have other Chicago locations).  Whether you want dim sum, noodles, sushi or curry- Korean, Thai, Chinese, Indian, Japanese and even Vietnamese food is represented.  

I really do enjoy Habibi-Inn’s beef shawarma wrap and any meat option served over their salad plate.  I love the Arepas from La Cocinita, but I’m not the biggest fan of their tacos- then, I can’t think of anywhere else for great tacos within walking distance.  

I suppose Cupitol, Colectivo, Newport, Philz and Peets are all cafe chains, even Coralie has a satellite location in the NW campus.  There’s also Berry Pike!

Fried Chicken from the Chicken Shack, Burger from Edzo’s, Barbecue from Hecky’s (though if you can drive I’d recommend Soul & Smoke); all Evanston classics.

I haven’t visited the larger dine in options, I’m more of a pop in and go guy.  Smylie Brothers, Farmhouse, Found, I’m sure they’re all delicious for an extra $ sign.

I think Evanston could do with more drinking options, does Evanston have a spot anymore that’s more bar than restaurant?

Downtown has two surviving book shops with Bookends and Beginnings and Amaranth Used books.  I do miss Market Fresh Books.  I’ve been visiting Comix Revolutions for at least 15 years now.  There’s even Evanston Games & Cafe for you D20 rollers.

Did there used to be more? Yes. Between our previous city manager (Wally B) and half a City Council that wanted to turn Evanston into a mashup of Winnetka and Naperville, lots of old storefronts and affordable rent shop spaces were demolished in favor of high rises that serve well-heeled seniors and grad student families. (See also: Wally B and the runaway municipal debt due to terrible city management.)

Small music venues and dive bars? Evanston has always had to work uphill for any bar, especially anything ""dive"" that catered to students. The town was dry for decades, they didn't even want to support students living off of campus (hello, ""brothel law""?) Awesome places like Nevins (which, let's be real, was more of a grad student hang out because of prices) are long gone replaced with a generic high rise. The Keg is gone. Live music used to be the norm at funky coffee shops and jazz at Pete Miller's was fantastic. Pete Miller's is gone. Lots of funky coffee shops are now chain shops. You still get national acts at places like Space, but there are fewer places that provide a venue for local bands and groups. Hopefully, that will change after COVID. I used to play out at a place on Central in the early 90's that is now gone.

Evanston struggles with being the intersection of a LOT of things and NU happens to be in the crosshairs more often than not because it has not historically worked with the town very well. Land is at a premium. The town has had to do battle with NU more than once over the historic district (NU would like to have free rein to build where and whenever, Evanston is into preservation). NU would like to ""own"" the beach and waterfront on the east side of campus....but the city (and the State) aren't going to let that happen. Lots of higher-income folk want to live in a liberal town without paying for liberal programs (or don't want to live in a liberal town at all! They would like Evanston to be Wilmette-south.) Some people want to be ""diversity-adjacent"" (income, race and ethnicity) without having to actually, you know, live WITH people who are different than they are. They want to go out to hip bars and restaurants, but don't want bar/restaurant goer's making noise outside of their house at 2 am.

Don't get me wrong. I like Evanston, moved back after living elsewhere, graduated from NU long ago, but it is a town of major contradictions and those contradictions put different groups at odds with each other. NU students aren't the priority of the City Council, and often are more often discussed as a nuisance that the town has to put up with (whether you agree with that or not, it is what it is.)",t2_ey2rx,jmochicago,0,1641496903.0,0,t1_hrj3w2r,hrj3w2r,True,Powledge-is-knower,t3_rx1q20,https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/rx1q20/why_doesnt_evanston_have_the_usual_college_town/,"Why doesn’t Evanston have the usual college town feel downtown?

"Bars: This is the easiest one to answer IMO, as others have said this town has a deep history with teetotalers, and arguably that history was extended into the 21st century by Tisdahl's administration. Before WOB opened in the Fountain Sq. building, there was an attempt to open a Tilted Kilt in the location and while I don't think I can conflate not liking the Tilted Kilt with not accepting bars (WOB would eventually get their license), the dialogue during the approval process was eye opening into how little progress had been made in the Town's stance on bars.    
Another thing is that the tradition of teetotaling created a norm for NU students to seek out the city for nightlife, so any place that wants to court NU students is already competing with the city. Most of the 'bars' in town realized quickly it was more profitable to go after the Evanston non student crowd, which is why Bar Louie, Bat 17, Nevins, Prairie Moon etc. never really tried to specifically target the NU market. There was a brief moment in time where I think WOB pretty successfully went after the grad student market and had some well run trivia nights, but the only other attempts I can think of is the Keg (whole other can of worms) and La Mocc. I'm not even counting neighborhood spots like Bluestone or Candelite. I would be shocked if NU undergrads even consider those places.   
I feel pretty safe making these assumptions because the trend is echoed in housing and restaurants downtown, we're seeing more transit oriented developments for the crowd another person described as 'yuppies', and the restaurants have also changed over time. I would doubt anyone here knows about Fritz's on Chicago, but when it existed it was definitely emblematic of a funky collegetown place. The Tapas place there currently is more of a ""bring parents when they're in town"" place.
Opening a ""college town bar"" in downtown Evanston right now would be a considerably risky investment, not even considering COVID: high cost of doing business, high rent, competing with established Chicago bars and clubs, and no clear guarantee that NU undergrads will make it profitable. Yes, you could point to Bob's Pizza and La Mocc as proof that the demand is there, but I seriously wonder if that can sustain a place that only does that.  Short Version: Evanston's long history of being unfriendly to bars and rising costs have made opening the type of bar you're talking about incredibly risky.    

Small Music Venues: So it depends on how small we're talking about. Pre-Covid, Evanston actually had a decent open mic/small act scene, but you had to really do some assembly to put together a schedule. Kaffein on Chicago closing pre-pandemic did not help. If we're talking a little bit bigger, I think the answer is much easier than the bar thing: purely a mix of lacking the spaces and nimbyism. I think there is the demand (and Space + Temperance have proved that recently) but all of our venue appropriate architecture has either been raised or converted: Evanston theaters on Central turned into apartment, of the two movie theaters that were once on Sherman- one is completely gone (Rotary building block) and the other would require extensive reconversion (Varsity) and renovation. All the other appropriate spaces are owned by either churches or NU. I know the former Carmen's on Church tried to do a small venue model, but it looks like management kind of stalled a few times. This really means that you would have to build it, and between nimbyism and the cost I think it's been a non starter. Northlight Theater is trying to come back to downtown, but money is currently the issue. Also see Welsh Ryan private events City Council hearings for proof that large scale stuff will encounter even fiercer nimbyism.   
   
Finally, Funky Shops: I would argue these are in the decline in all of America's college towns. I grew up in Evanston, worked in Champaign-Urbana, and currently spend most of my time in Bloomington, so I feel like as far as the Midwest goes I have seen some of the more ""collegey"" college towns and it's become harder and harder to be a small business and especially be a weird one. A lot of what remains are passion projects that will die when the owner retires of dies. Still, there are some in Evanston that remain but aren't exactly right by campus: Dave's Rock shop the store now in Bookman's alley, they exist, but can be hard to track down sometimes.    
Sorry about the long post, but I just wanted to add some more context and put in the perspective that Evanston is what you make of it, and many of these things have existed here and will probably exist again after COVID.",t2_hrohr,BudHolly,0,1641487394.0,0,t1_hridv1t,hridv1t,True,Powledge-is-knower,t3_rx1q20,https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/rx1q20/why_doesnt_evanston_have_the_usual_college_town/,"Why doesn’t Evanston have the usual college town feel downtown?

"**[Amazingrace Coffeehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazingrace_Coffeehouse)** 
 
 >Amazingrace Coffeehouse (later known as Amazingrace) was an influential counterculture music and performance venue in Evanston, Illinois, during the 1970s. Run by a collective called the Amazingrace Family, it was known for its welcoming atmosphere, eclectic menu, excellent sound system, and respectful audiences. Amazingrace was the top music club in the Chicago Reader poll 1973-1975, plus Number 3 in the 1975 wrap-up of ""Who's Who in Chicago's Alternative Culture"".

"You're right, it's hard to be the only restaurant in town to put that extra requirement on customers. And, by extension, it is indeed admirable that the proprietors of Found are doing it anyway, likely out of greater concern for the safety of their own staff than for revenue.

But who knows, maybe they'll find that the vaccinated people of Evanston reward them with *more* business, since it's one of the few places they can go and be assured that everybody else there cares as much about public health as they do. 

However, as you rightly infer, Evanston restaurants as a whole would probably be better off if we handled things like they do in New York City, where access to all bars and restaurants requires proof of vaccination by government decree.

Part of the problem is crime coming up form the city and despite what the CPD says there is an incredible rise in crime-even with the manipulating of charges-calling a car hijacking a property crime rather than a violent crime of any sort.

I wouldn't read too much into most of it though.  Car thefts and catalytic converter thefts are happening because nobody has cash and homes are far too dangerous to break into  (they're like the last thing a criminal can steal).  Those are getting harder too with technology and awareness.

I feel like overall it is pretty safe. Some areas are better than others, though. The map seems to fit with my sense of the area from living here for over five years (south and north Evanston).

If you don't care about being near transit then you can find cheaper places west of Asbury in south and central Evanston. On the north side the apartments are pretty much near Northwestern or along the Central St. corridor (going west on Central will reduce the average rent). Keep in mind that the less expensive areas are also not near a good chunk of the restaurants, bars, and retailers. But you're never too far from anything by bike or a short car trip.

As for noise I think that the student-heavy areas will maybe be more tolerant as it comes with the territory. But consider whether you want to live around a lot of undergraduates.

"Hyatt Place is a brand new hotel, so the rooms are probably pretty nice. It’s on the edge of downtown so if you don’t mind walking a couple blocks you can find free parking. I think the only parking at the hotel itself is valet, but I could be wrong. 

My mom stays in the Hilton every time she visits. The rooms are nice - I would say a step up from your average hotel. It’s attached to a parking garage so parking is easy but can be expensive. I think they charge $22 a night or something.

"This is a result of a complaint or a random spot check.  Either way I’m pretty sure everyone else on your block got checked out and cited.  Sounds like alley inspection.

our alley got inspected back in July.  Most citations were for not having address visible on garage, but others were for the same things you mentioned like “scrape and paint”.

Although they “say” they’ll re-inspect within 2 weeks, they are pretty lenient about giving extensions.  One place on our block only just got around to fixing their garage doors last week.

if You do nothing you eventually end up on the Property Dockets and even THEN they will give you more time.  I know you won’t believe me but they would rather do everything possible to get you to do the repair(s) rather than fine you.  I’ve followed the Property Docket Court for years and that’s how it works.   

Also if you do get fined, you just don’t pay and they put a Lien on the property.  That’s it.  You have to pay it before you can sell it.

"It seems that you’re looking mostly at the Metra trains in your post, and you’d be correct on the first two counts, but Chicago does have a second train system, the L (CTA). This is a light rail compared to the heavier commuter rail that the Metra is, but the downside is that it doesn’t go as far out into the suburbs. Evanston has the furthest north part of the L system that runs through the east side of town, and that’s preferred over the Metra for most trips into Chicago. Because of that, I don’t know if we could offer as good of insights into Metra travel.

"I lived in DT Evanston from 2009-2011, lived in LP, GC, RN from 2012- 2015, NYC, 2016- 2020. 

I don’t remember downtown Evanston being this bad. Covid really drove the area down and it’s a bit sad. I live off of Davis Street and it’s crazy to see all of the vacancies. Equally, it’s nuts to see how many places have Now Hiring signs in their windows and they haven’t changed for months. The homeless people are much more aggressive too now. I have to walk by 5-7 of them over a 3 block period and everyday at least 3x a day and if I don’t acknowledge every single one I get yelled at and threatened by them. 

One time I talked back to one of them bc I was fed up with his BS and some lady ran across the street and called the cops on ME. The guy ended up getting arrested for public intoxication according to the officer and I had no idea he was drunk to begin with. 

I don’t know...I moved back to Evanston after living in NYC because I loved living here close to ten years ago, I appreciate hustle and bustle along with a diverse community, but it seems that it’s definitely gone downhill from my memory.

If you are interested in fostering a cat, please join Felines of Chicago (cat foster network) through (Facebook groups if you are on Fb) and then fill out our intake survey at www.felinesofchicago.org/foster.html to pair you to one of our 25+ partnered and licensed cat rescues in Illinois. 

Our survey matches you with a rescue that is the best fit for you based on your location, the rescue’s vet location, transportation needs, experience, and time commitment (as well the rescue’s intake status!). Once are matched to a rescue, you’ll complete their foster application. We are with you every step of the way to ensure your application is processed and that approval is expedited. 

ALL VET NEEDS ARE COMPLETELY PAID FOR THROUGH THE RESCUES VET. 

We need the community to work together as there is limited space at city shelters and unfortunately, without licensed rescues and their fosters, there is no rescue. 

WE NEED FOSTERS LIKE YOU TO SAVE CATS! Cats are NOT indefinitely located at shelters, there is simply not enough room, especially at open access and high kill shelters. The majority of cat rescues are completely foster home based. If a cat is saved, it’s because a rescue with a foster stepped in. That’s right— all the shelter cats are depending on YOU!

The life you save, will change yours! 

About Us: Felines of Chicago is a local 501c3 organisation which provides around the clock foster support, community resources and education, in addition to being a professional liaison to our partnered rescues. We additionally assist with community TNR (Trap-Neuter-Release/Rescue). Please visit our website at www.felinesofchicago.org to learn more!


Commonly Asked Questions:

I don't have a car, can I still foster? 

YES! We can often arrange transportation if you are unable to drive or take an Uber. 

I have a resident cat/dog/other pet, can I still foster? 

YES! Our rescues (depending on the situation) usually require resident cats to be vaccinated and spayed/neutered. You’ll need to be able to separate your foster from your resident cats in a different room for about a week or so and then slowly introduce your foster. A bathroom is ideal, as are bedrooms or large walk in closets. 

I have never had a cat before, can I still foster? 

YES! We will pair you with a low maintenance kitty that best suits your level of experience 🐈‍⬛ 

I work full time, can I still foster? 

YES! Some cats just need a place to sleep, eat, chill out and have some loving when you get home!

I will need to travel out of town, can I still foster? 

YES! Let us know at least week ahead of time and we will help coordinate care for your foster if you need assistance. 

Are foster cats indoor only?

Yes, unless supervised for enrichment such as on a catio. Unfortunately, cats who free roam are likely to be hit by cars, get injured by other animals (and abused or even stolen by humans), and contract incurable & often deadly diseases which are otherwise preventable.

How long do I foster?

This depends from case to case. We recommend being prepared to for at least a 4-8 week commitment, however there are shorter and longer time frames. We also have a need for emergency stays that are short term. 

Are supplies provided? 

Depends on the rescue. Sometimes we are able to get supply donations for those who are in financial need. If you are in need of some supplies, we can likely find some for you but generally fosters are expected to provide food + bowls (ceramic is best), litter-box + litter, toys/enrichment and a soft place to sleep. Carriers may or may not be borrowed, but we recommend purchasing a hard carrier.


Our partnered cat rescues are Homeward Bound and thus the majority of cats rescued are from Chicago area and the State of Illinois, open access shelters. We also assist with TNR and community rehoming cases. When we are able, we also assist with cats displaced in natural disasters and in high kill shelters from different regions of the United States. At the current moment, animal controls in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas are ALL asking us for help. We can’t save them without you.",t2_7c4nbqe8,begemot_kot,0,1629582594.0,0,t1_h9u4y7p,h9u4y7p,True,[deleted],t3_p901gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/p901gr/chicagoland_cat_fosters_urgently_needed_chicago/,Chicagoland Cat Fosters Urgently Needed!

"Keep in mind that lost cats usually stay pretty close to home. Don't lose hope if you don't find her immediately, just take a walk up and down your block regularly over the next few days if she hasn't returned. Especially at night once its a bit more quiet where she would be less afraid to be out searching around, theoretically.

Put some of your clothes outside, maybe some food, and your kittys cat bed/toys. Something she can smell and associate with home. She will get hungry and she'll look for familiarity. 

I've had a few cats run out on me over the years. We found them a day or two later walking around yards on our block, and one came to our front door where we had put her bed, our clothes, and some wet food. 

Good luck and we'll keep an eye out over near the hospital area.

"If you have a parking spot, covered or uncovered bring your car. You can download an app to get notifications about when you need to move it for street cleaning or snow emergency.  pay the wheel tax so you dont get tickets and download the park Evanston app.

Ive lived her 35 years (form Florida) and always had uncovered parking. I also never put snow tires on but have all wheel drive-depending on what you have you may or may not want snow tires.  

You do need a good coat-I suggest TJ Maxx which will have 100s of parkas for 1/3 the price of retail-or Nordstrom Rack in Skokie.  It should be hip length. You also do need snow boots with treads. Sorrel is a pretty good choice. Hat and mittens also essential.

If you need someone to help you move your furniture in Dolly is an option. So is the Next-door app-there are tons of HS and college kids on there offering their services and I have found them every bit as good and much less money than dolly for furniture movement.

"Personally, I have a car here and definitely prefer it. Evanston is a little more spread out and it’s pretty easy to find parking most places so it doesn’t feel like a hassle. I spent many years trudging around in the cold weather and snow while living in Chicago, and I’m just over it. I don’t have a covered spot, which is fine because it hasn’t snowed too heavy in the winters I’ve had my car (last year was an exception) and cleaning it off hasn’t been an issue. I don’t have snow tires because evanston is flat and it seems silly. I’d vote for bringing your car so you can venture out and explore a little more. It’s also a lot more convenient for errands and groceries like you mentioned, even though you could manage it without a car.

"1. It's totally doable without a car, but I brought my car with me bc I knew that I wanted my car here. It really depends on how important your car is to your particular lifestyle and whether it is worth the cost (parking, insurance, repairs, etc.). In the winter, as long as you have the right gear (coat, long underwear/base layers, good socks and snow shoes), getting around is just fine. For the first few months of moving here, I almost exclusively used public transit to get everywhere except to buy groceries because I wanted to get to know the area really well. I eventually stopped bc I like being able to drive to some of my hobbies, but I could still do them if I didn't have my car.
2. They do plow the streets, but your car might get stuck in it's parking space depending on how much snow there is. The one day we had about 20 inches of snow, it took me an hour to dig my car out of its assigned outdoor space. My car already had snow tires on them when I moved here not bc of the weather (I'm from CA), but because those were the ones that fit my tires and I got good quality ones on sale from Costco 😂
3. As long as you have a parking space it doesn't matter as long as you wake up early on snow days to brush the snow/ice off your windows or dig your car out of the snow. I have an uncovered space and I'm just happy it's my assigned spot and I don't have to worry about street parking. Covered parking is nice, but it's hard to find and can be more expensive.

Groceries you’ll be right near a Trader Joe and Jewel so public trans won’t make sense for that, I use my bicycle with bags on it and ride them home in 2-3 minutes.

"If you can avoid bringing a car, do it.  You will most likely end up parking on the street unless you can find paid parking in a Lot that is either Open or Covered.  If you park on the street you will have to pay attention to the Street Cleaning signs and make sure you move your car at the appropriate times or you will get a ticket.

We can get some bad snow here and then you have to dig your car out of the snow on the street.  

You can easily rent a truck from U-Haul or Home Depot here (pick up or box truck) to move stuff.  Ends up being much cheaper than owning a car/truck just for that.  You can also hire guys off the DOLLY app (uber for movers).  They seem to get good reviews around here but can get busy quick.  There are also local movers that will move stuff from room-to-room or just a few pieces from one place to the other.  Movers are not just for whole-house moves.

"Without cat fosters, there is no rescue. Fostering is simple, rewarding, and you literally save lives! Cats and kittens are euthanised at open access and high kill shelters, unless there are foster homes for them. Please be the difference and consider fostering a cat! 

We currently are trying to place healthy adult cats, cats and kittens who need varying degrees of medical attention, moms taking care of their kittens, and shy cats who need a patient foster. There is a cat for every person, whether you work full time or stay home, and all experience levels are welcome! We will find the perfect fit for you and support you throughout the process. 

If you are interested in fostering a cat, please join Felines of Chicago (cat foster network) through (Facebook groups if you are on Fb) and then fill out our intake survey at www.felinesofchicago.org/foster.html to pair you to one of our 25+ partnered and licensed cat rescues in Illinois. 

Our survey matches you with a rescue that is the best fit for you based on your location, the rescue’s vet location, transportation needs, experience, and time commitment (as well the rescue’s intake status!). Once are matched to a rescue, you’ll complete their foster application. We are with you every step of the way to ensure your application is processed and that approval is expedited. 

ALL VET NEEDS ARE COMPLETELY PAID FOR THROUGH THE RESCUES VET. 

We need the community to work together as there is limited space at city shelters and unfortunately, without licensed rescues and their fosters, there is no rescue. 

WE NEED FOSTERS LIKE YOU TO SAVE CATS! Cats are NOT indefinitely located at shelters, there is simply not enough room, especially at open access and high kill shelters. The majority of cat rescues are completely foster home based. If a cat is saved, it’s because a rescue with a foster stepped in. That’s right— all the shelter cats are depending on YOU!

The life you save, will change yours! 

About Us: Felines of Chicago is a local 501c3 organisation which provides around the clock foster support, community resources and education, in addition to being a professional liaison to our partnered rescues. We additionally assist with community TNR (Trap-Neuter-Release/Rescue). Please visit our website at www.felinesofchicago.org to learn more!


Commonly Asked Questions:

I don't have a car, can I still foster? 

YES! We can often arrange transportation if you are unable to drive or take an Uber. 

I have a resident cat/dog/other pet, can I still foster? 

YES! Our rescues (depending on the situation) usually require resident cats to be vaccinated and spayed/neutered. You’ll need to be able to separate your foster from your resident cats in a different room for about a week or so and then slowly introduce your foster. A bathroom is ideal, as are bedrooms or large walk in closets. 

I have never had a cat before, can I still foster? 

YES! We will pair you with a low maintenance kitty that best suits your level of experience 🐈‍⬛ 

I work full time, can I still foster? 

YES! Some cats just need a place to sleep, eat, chill out and have some loving when you get home!

I will need to travel out of town, can I still foster? 

YES! Let us know at least week ahead of time and we will help coordinate care for your foster if you need assistance. 

Are foster cats indoor only?

Yes, unless supervised for enrichment such as on a catio. Unfortunately, cats who free roam are likely to be hit by cars, get injured by other animals (and abused or even stolen by humans), and contract incurable & often deadly diseases which are otherwise preventable.

How long do I foster?

This depends from case to case. We recommend being prepared to for at least a 4-8 week commitment, however there are shorter and longer time frames. We also have a need for emergency stays that are short term. 

Are supplies provided? 

Depends on the rescue. Sometimes we are able to get supply donations for those who are in financial need. If you are in need of some supplies, we can likely find some for you but generally fosters are expected to provide food + bowls (ceramic is best), litter-box + litter, toys/enrichment and a soft place to sleep. Carriers may or may not be borrowed, but we recommend purchasing a hard carrier.


Our partnered cat rescues are Homeward Bound and thus the majority of cats rescued are from Chicago area and the State of Illinois, open access shelters. We also assist with TNR and community rehoming cases. When we are able, we also assist with cats displaced in natural disasters and in high kill shelters from different regions of the United States. At the current moment, animal controls in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas are ALL asking us for help.

"As other commenters have noted it seems like a good town to raise young kids in, but it may be best if you're partnered already.

"It's fantastic. After a few years in the city we moved to south Evanston in 2016. Then we needed more space and moved to north Evanston in 2020. Both areas are great places to live. Taxes are kind of high, but I feel like they're up everywhere in the area. 

All the schools are good. There are a decent number of daycares in the area, but only a few that take infants and preschoolers. (A lot of them are one or the other.) 

Plenty to do here. No shortage of parks and greenspace. Good restaurants and even some live music. Transit into the city is of course great, and if you use Metra your commute will be quicker than using the El in many parts of the city. (If you need to commute by car it is a different story as highways are not very close and most of the the surface streets aren't quick.)

"It's a Start.

That's the ""problem"".   

The fact that it is a START has some people ""concerned"".  Maybe this will continue and spread to other areas of the country.  Those are the racist concerns.   The only quick comparison that comes to mind are the arguments that were made AGAINST allowing women to vote.  If you are interested, you can look up what the common counter-points to woman voting were at the time. Holy crap what a lot of scared white guys.

It is only Reparations for local HOUSING Discrimination that happened in the past.  It is not ""Reparations for Slavery"".    It only affects a relatively small group of people that qualify.  So because it does not solve **EVERYTHING**, that's apparently bad.  That's Black folks talking.  And I agree with them. It's not enough.  

I don't know where you saw this ""video"" that got ""downvoted"".   Who are these people saying Evanston is ""gonna go downhill""?  People have been saying that for decades. The money to fund this is set aside from Cannabis sales tax in Evanston ONLY.  

There are people that claim raising the minimum wage will destroy the economy.  But when it is actually raised, nothing bad seems to happen and the critics move on to something else.

"Landscapers and Tree Trimmers take bulk yard waste to a Transfer Station that accepts it for a “tipping fee”.  There is one in Lake Bluff, I don’t recall the name. They charge by volume, not weight, that’s why everything goes into the chipper first.  

We do a lot of yard work on our own and generate quite a bit of waste but we cut down branches and trim stuff so it does not take up as much space, which in turn means most of it fits into our Yard Waste Bin.  The Bin is the equivalent of 3 “bags”.
