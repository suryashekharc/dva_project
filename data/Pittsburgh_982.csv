"The reason this happened is the census was mismanaged locally.  Most of Washington County was miscounted, and missed!  The people in charge of community outreach got paid a lot and did. Nothing at all!  
There are many community’s that don’t get mail delivery, so they never got the letters and the enumerators that went out didn’t care.  I’ve heard that some towns lost half of their population according to the 2020 head count.  And ones that are growing lost people compared to a study the census does called the American community survey that updated the data yearly from the census.  
Covid didn’t help because kids are supposed to be counted where they would’ve been for college. I bet Cal U lost thousands of people right there! 
If anyone saw the growth In Washington County it would be hard to believe they lost so many people.  

This is just one county , but if the census screwed up this county imagine what happened in the others!   The entire 2020 census should’ve been abandoned once Covid started and they could’ve used the numbers from the American community survey, that serves the same purpose.",t2_3pqnd8mf,queenoftheidiots,0,1648290018.0,0,t1_i26e6u3,i26e6u3,True,TehSoupNazi,t3_to2ret,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/to2ret/pittsburgh_metro_area_loses_population_leads/,"Pittsburgh metro area loses population, leads nation in natural population decline",/r/pittsburgh/comments/to2ret/pittsburgh_metro_area_loses_population_leads/i26e6u3/,2,r/pittsburgh,0,2

So I work the night shift too, 7PM-7AM.

"Ok, here is your final answer: You've been spamming everywhere, obviously worried about whether or not you should buy this house. I am telling you, as an experienced contractor and house flipper: do not buy this house. 

My main reason? Having a home with a crawlspace is one step above a mobile home. No judgement, but I've fixed too many plumbing problems in spider infested mobile home crawlspaces to recommend ever having something similar. It's cheap construction that has more problems that can come up than is offset by it's lack of cost. Basements here are always preferred.

"What type of tattoo do you want to get? You should find an artist who matches the style and imagery you want to get. Such as American traditional, realism, black & grey, surrealism, new school, etc. There’s no one good place to get everything and some shops won’t do certain size tattoos. Shops that aren’t street shops likely have a minimum time limit for each tattoo they do.

Find out what exactly you want then look around at different shops that fit your style. One artist I really like and want to get a future tattoo from is Mark Albert (fine line black & grey) at Dark Matter. Also, Sarah Miller who owns Wyld Chyld is amazing for large scale realism, portraits, surrealism. She was runner up on Ink Master season 2.

"You don't want to live anywhere in the south hills. I grew up in South Park. The South hills is great if you don't ever want to leave the South hills. I'd probably say you either want to be in the North hills or the east side. Check out regent square, Edgewood, Ross township, Westview. Coming from the city on 279 all the way out to cranberry is nice to live. Once you get a little bit off of 279 it gets worse. Like glenshaw's bad shalers okay. I'd avoid anything too far out route 28 or route 8 for traffic reasons and commuting from the east.

The main reason that you want to probably avoid the South hills is this. From downtown to Wexford going north it takes 20 minutes. To go the same distance from the city into the South hills it probably takes 45 minutes se time a day. Worse at traffic times. Everything's one lane roads each direction. The South hills infrastructure wasn't made to handle the population that it has now. I'm 46 and I lived in the South hills in a nice area for 38 years. Next I lived in the east side for 3 years and then now in the North hills for the last three. Every time I go back to the South hills I grit my teeth and how much it sucks to get around all my family still lives there. East side is more City living or at least it's closer to the city. North hills is more suburban living. Both very close drive time wise to the city.

"Forgive me if I’m mistaken, but it seems like you’re asking two similar but distinct questions. Do you want to know why Pittsburghers don’t move from one side of the city to another? Or why they don’t go across town to shop and recreate? There’s a difference between moving to the North Hills from the South Hills, and driving to the Bethel Park Best Buy from your house in Ross Township. 

To answer the second question first, the vast majority of stores, goods, and services are available to you within your respective area of the North, South, East, or West. To use your example of Best Buy from another comment, if you live in the North Hills you’re not going to drive to the Bethel Park Best Buy, you’ll go to the one in Cranberry or the one on McKnight. If you live in Moon, you’ll go to the one in Robinson, not West Mifflin. 

But let’s say you need to go to a store with fewer locations like a Sam’s Club or a Costco. Depending what part of the South Hills you live in, you’ll probably go to the Sam’s in West Mifflin, or Robinson, before you decide to drive through a tunnel twice and cross a bridge four times. If you want Costco, same deal. You’re going to the Robison, or Homestead one, not Cranberry. There is absolutely a factor of localist mentality I think, but most of the stuff you need is on your respective side of downtown, and if you have to travel outside of your “region” it’s still typically closer and more convenient to go to an adjacent area than the opposite side of Pittsburgh. 

Which leads me back to the first question, why don’t Pittsburghers move. Since people typically have everything they need within the same area, they get very familiar with just that area and don’t really learn any other side of Pittsburgh because they don’t have to. They have no reason to go there (Why people from the South Hills are unfamiliar with the North Hills and vice versa). If you know the South Hills very well, I think you’re going to look at houses and apartments there first because it’s the area you know. In most cases with renting, unless you have very specific criteria, I think you’re going to find something that suits your needs and price range in one of the South Hill’s neighborhoods. And if you’re making a big decision like buying a house, I think people are naturally inclined to want to make a decision they feel well informed about. If you’re from the North Hills you’re familiar with your township and the other townships, and boroughs in the area. You have an idea of what the area has to offer and what the school districts are like. You probably don’t know as much about Castle Shannon, Bethel Park, Baldwin, or West Mifflin. There are certain qualities of an area you learn best by being around there. That doesn’t mean someone can’t or won’t make a move from West View to Baldwin, but I think you’re naturally inclined to lean more towards the area you know if all other things are relatively equal.

That’s my understanding at least. That and the mental block that comes with rivers, tunnels, and bridges. I grew up in the South Hills, lived in the North Hills, and landed in the East End. When I lived in the South I rarely went to the North. When I lived in the North I rarely went to the South. There just wasn’t a reason to. 

TL;DR - Moving and shopping aren’t the same, but either way people stay in their area because they’re familiar with it, and it has what they need.",t2_54c0yukh,soupsoup1326,0,1648241362.0,0,t1_i24373b,i24373b,False,byzvntine,t3_tnlv7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/tnlv7k/is_there_really_a_divide_between_the_north_and/,Is there really a divide between the North and South Hills?,/r/pittsburgh/comments/tnlv7k/is_there_really_a_divide_between_the_north_and/i24373b/,3,r/pittsburgh,0,3

"Maybe I should be more clear... If I left that triangle on anything more than a bike ride, I was just as likely to have left the greater Boston area.  But I certainly didn't need to cross a river to do any of my daily activities and 80% of my Boston area friends group lived within that triangle.  Thus it was relatively rare to leave that area.  Most commonly I'd go further into the city for things or occasionally just outside that triangle into Watertown or Arlington.  But I certainly had very little need to ever go into the suburbs beyond that.

"I can’t speak highly enough of Dormont (or any South Hills neighborhood, really). 

We aren’t originally from the South Hills, but moved to Brookline in 2015 and then to Dormont (after we had a kid) in 2020. We fell in love with both neighborhoods. I’m also bullish on Beechview and have been for a long time. 

With that said, I honestly think Dormont is the perfect neighborhood in the metro area. The light rail runs through here and has three stations. It’s super walkable (not just within Dormont itself, but the rest of the South Hills; I can walk to 5-6 different CBDs within 15-20 mins). 

School District is ranked lower than Lebo/USC/BP, but the houses are slightly cheaper (and mostly same size and age/quality as a lot of the Lebo houses), much better taxes, and we adore the more urban/dense feel (feels like an extension of the city).

Edit: I saw Carnegie mentioned. I don’t know enough about it, but it appears to be a lovely little neighborhood. Their CBD is very nice, in my opinion, and reminds me a lot of your stereotypical tight-knit Western PA town (not unlike the ones I mentioned above; Brookline and Beechview are both city neighborhoods, but they feel like and act like their own separate towns and blend in more with the SH burbs than the city, in my opinion).

"My wife and I have been in Carnegie for a year.  I like it a lot.  There are definitely some poorly kept houses (elderly hoarders I suspect) and some of the roads need repaved but I’ve never felt unsafe.  The main strip has some pretty good spots.  Plus it’s close to shopping centers in Green Tree, Bridgeville, and Mt Lebanon.  Getting onto 376 is super easy too.  

The housing prices can be completely random - some $200k fixer uppers (and I mean **fixer upper**) with some $450k flips - so there might be opportunities.  We live near the park and the houses near me offer a bit more space.  My neighbors are a mix of empty nesters and young families.  I suspect that we’ll be moving once we have kids that are close to high school age bc the local HS doesn’t have a good reputation.

We looked at Dormont at first but houses there are typically much closer together and street parking is harder to come by.  I had the sense that the ones we looked at were way overpriced due to proximity to the Liberty Tunnel / Downtown but there are some gems there.

I’ve lived in the South Hills-ish area for a while so not sure about the others but under $220k, you can pretty much kiss Bethel Park goodbye.  That is, unless you want to live in a condo.

"What kinds of things do you like to do? Maybe I'm just spoiled because I moved here from a town whose nicest restaurant was an Olive Garden that we got in the 2010s, but this is a metro area with like 2 million people. There's always stuff going on.

The Opera is putting on Carmen this weekend, the Ballet has a unique performance this weekend, the Symphony is doing Rachmaminoff and Bruckner this weekend, the Guins are home on Sunday, there are literally more good to great restaurants here than anyone could eat at in a life time. I'm weird for this I'm sure, but I think grocers are a blast to go to - we have Nepali markets, Korean markets, at least one European market, a couple of old school butchers, there are a ton of incredible city and county parks, we have a massive casino, several small music venues which almost certainly have something playing this weekend, Phipps, the national Aviary, a zoo, if you're into bars, South Side and the North Side both have vibrant bars that cater to younger crowds, Lawrenceville and Shadyside have similar but more restrained scenes, and every single neighborhood has smaller local bars for quieter nights.

There are 90 neighborhoods in Pittsburgh - have you been to all of them? 130+ municipalities in the county, checked those out? You were going to drive to Indiana, if you add like 30-45 minutes onto that drive you can be in Erie, Cleveland, Steubenville/Weirton, Wheeling or Morgantown.

I truly don't mean any offense by this, but it absolutely boggles my mind that people can't figure out what to do here. From the way some people talk about it you'd think this was a town of 300 not 300,000. This is a MAJOR METRO AREA. There are only 26 larger metros in the country.

"Living in the North Hills my whole life, going to the South Hills and the countryside around it is always an excursion, so much so that my friend and I have affectionately named that part of the region the ""Mingolands"".

If my family is up for a Saturday afternoon drive, we always go north. If something draws us to the south, it has to be pre-planned at least a day in advance because 1. The traffic needs to be considered, and 2. We don't know the areas well, so we certainly don't go there without a destination. I know this sounds mega dramatic and old-fashioned, and it is, but it's also just the truth. I have been to Zelienople hundreds of times. I have been to South Park exactly four.

I know there's a lot of cool stuff to the south, but to get there, you have to contend with the giant metropolis that has no quick or easy way to get through or around. Every single way is a pain in the ass. And this is coming from someone who loves to travel,  loves finding new things to do, and drives for a living.
