"The Constitution gives the power of setting the rules of federal elections to the states. It also says Congress may override them, but, as the article states:

>It’s one thing for Congress to “make or alter” regulations for time, place and manner of elections. It’s arguably another for Congress to mandate that non-partisan commissions define the contours of the districts ... The court might decide there’s a distinction between requiring single-member districts and requiring a particular method of drawing them.  
>  
>It’s also easy to imagine the current Supreme Court holding that states have an inherent right to draw their own districts. States have had that power since the earliest days of the Constitution, and even before it — if you count the states’ power to choose representatives to Congress under the Articles of Confederation. This history could be used to claim that states cannot be divested of the power to draw districts as they see fit.  
>  
>The court might also worry about Congress claiming too much power over districting. Imagine a situation in which, instead of mandating non-partisan commissions, Congress takes over districting directly. That would amount to a radical change in how districts are set, transferring power to Congress and away from states.

"Not everyone pleased:

There are also plenty of other businesses along the two Bethesda streeteries benefiting from the temporary open space design.   
That isn't exactly the case at the Downtown Silver Spring streetery on Newell St. A Downtown Silver Spring resident, who asked not to be identified, said she's starting to reach her ""breaking point.""

""We haven’t been able to get answers. We’ve reached out to councilmembers, to the county executive, to the heads of the department of transportation, parks department. We don’t understand why it’s still closed,"" she said. ""I’ve actually spent time out here during the lockdowns. It started to become disruptive in terms of noise at all hours of the day, particularly when the weather’s warm and in the summertime. A lot of people either are retired or they work from home, and they’ll come out here and start drinking and blast music while you’re trying to have a Zoom call in your apartment. And then on the weekends, people would come, and they would grill and smoke right next to the building."" 

In the winter, FOX 5 saw some residents complain about a tent with a generator that was assembled at the streetery for use during the colder months. At least two workers were also tasked with monitoring the location.   
The Montgomery County Transportation Department Director told FOX 5 there is a working group of various agencies reviewing complaints at the Newell St. streetery. One option being discussed is whether moving the tables and other ""outdoor furniture"" away from the apartment building next to the streetery could help mitigate some of the issues there.

Yes, there was once a lake there, like 80 years ago, it was created by damming up the creek and the hydro power was used by the nearby trolley system.

"It's great to hear he's getting help for his addiction.  He nearly died less than ten years ago from necrotizing pancreatitis, some most often seen in alcoholics whose drinking causes pancreatitis and is left untreated.  In fact, many alcoholics will increase consumption when the initial pain from pancreatitis sets in, making it worse.  Having gone through that I'm certain he wasn't supposed to drink at all, he's fortunate to have survived and just as much so to have not relapsed and died after continuing to drink.  

Alcohol addiction/dependency might appear to be a behavior issue, but most often it's a disease that starts out as self-medicating for an undiagnosed/untreated mental health issue and becomes a physical dependency after repeated and heavy usage to the point it's unsafe to quit without medical supervision due to possible deadly withdrawal symptoms.

"The biggest downsides of the divergent diamond interchange the uncomfortability of driving on the wrong side of the road and the fact that the the lanes of opposing traffic meet each other at a light.  One big positive about them is that they basically make all turning movements equivalent to a one-way One Way interaction.  Basically if traffic levels are light and turns on red are permitted the turning movements can happen freely.  And when traffic is heavy the turning movements can happen during half of the signal cycle.  A typical diamond interchange would normally consist of two intersections but each intersection would have three phases, main Street, exits from the highway, and a protected left turn onto the on-ramp.  A spui, brings both intersections into one, this type of intersection exists where falls road meets 270.  They are still three phases at the intersection but it is only one intersection not two.  The diverging diamond maintains two intersection points but each intersection is two phases instead of three.  Again if the turning movements were really heavy and dominant diverging diamond would be the clear winner.  But given the heavy traffic on Georgia it would be better not to have a diverging diamond over here.  One nice benefit of the partial cloverleaf is while we are still maintaining two signalized intersections each signalized intersection will only be two phases one for main Street traffic and one for traffic exiting the beltway.  There is no need for a left turn onto the on-ramp because all movements onto the beltway will be through a ramp on the right side.  This works pretty well on the outer loop side of this intersection, it just needs to be replicated on the inner loop side. I have lived in the area long enough to remember the old ramps and at least for the outer loop it moves a lot better in this area.  It was surprising to me that when they lengthened the off ramp from the inner loop to Georgia South and put in a new traffic signal at that location that they did not convert the inner loop side into a partial cloverleaf.  I understand that there are many cars making the right turn on to Georgia, but given the infrastructure that's already there including the traffic signal that stops northbound traffic right in this area, that it would only be a relatively minor adjustment to make room for exiting traffic to make a left turn on to Georgia as well.  The off ramp only needs to be widened relatively slightly to be four lanes when it touches down on Georgia two lanes to the left and two lanes to the right.  The signal infrastructure is already there.

I understand that there are big plans to widen Georgia, but the modification of this interchange should not be reliant on those plans.  There may be some controversy regarding the eminent domain needed to actually wide in Georgia but none of that should have any effect on fixing the inner loop interchange.",t2_4f6kngqx,ZookeepergameNo5676,0,1647964332.0,0,t1_i1oaerm,i1oaerm,False,mpoltan03,t3_tjp8f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tjp8f0/diverging_diamond_at_georgia_avenue_i495_proposed/,Diverging Diamond at Georgia Avenue & I-495 - Proposed in MoCo’s Georgia Avenue Corridor Master Plan,/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tjp8f0/diverging_diamond_at_georgia_avenue_i495_proposed/i1oaerm/,2,r/MontgomeryCountyMD,0,2

"We bought new a construction townhouse around June 2020, after several covid related delays it wasn't until mid-January that we could move in. The market has already changed dramatically since then, and I think we bought just before it went insane, because they were still offering things like 20,000 credits in custom upgrades that they would never do now.

There are some positives you can get for new development. You can choose exactly what you want your floors, tiles, etc to be to suit you specific tastes, and not have to rip everything up and redo it (though the premium stuff will be very expensive in MoCo). Often, they have a lender of choice, and working with that lender gives you some sort of incentive, I think we got like 10k credit for doing that.

Bear in mind that the contractors they hire are probably the cheapest ones they could find, and they may not necessarily do good work. I think by the time my house was built, they had already build enough previous ones to not screw up. You do get a one year warranty to fix anything they did, and you need to really inspect your house to make sure it's all to the standard it needs to be.

As for your general question, yes, of course you can buy a house, if you have enough money and aren't afraid that you might be buying highly overvalued.

"It’s always good to look. You might not find what you want, but you also might get lucky. We bought in the ag reserve last summer and our real estate agent was excellent. We were able to get our house for not much more than asking. We were vastly outbid or the owners were playing games because of the crazy market. I’d interview a couple of realtors and then go with the one that is the most professional of those you liked. 

Our realtor added an escalation clause for the house we ended up with. I think most realtors do that in this market. Basically it increases the amount you’re willing to pay by an increment you choose until you either go over your max and the other party will get the house or you go over their max and you get the house. I believe we paid $20,000 over asking, which compared to the others was great. We saw houses going $100,000 to $150,000 over asking. 

Side note: I can send you a dm of my realtor if you’d like. She works out of Bethesda but knew our area quite well. Her son lives in Rockville and works with her. Side side note, we’ve had really good luck with mother son teams. This is our second time using a mother/son team, in different states. The mother brings deep knowledge and the sons bring energy and stamina. And then you have more than one person able to schedule a house tour.

"A divergent diamond would not be a good choice for here.  Diverging diamonds work best when the heaviest movement of traffic is from the street to the highway.  While there are certainly many people coming and going to the beltway at this location the majority of traffic still flows north and south on Georgia.  Therefore it would be silly to have Georgia traffic cross over each other twice thereby delaying this primary movement in order to make the turns to the beltway easier.  

The best thing that can be done here is with the construction of a partial cloverleaf otherwise known as a parclo.  This already happened on the outer loop side where there is one exit from the beltway and two entrances.  Everyone exiting from the outer loop will come to the traffic signal because they removed the tight loop ramp that used to exist to go southbound on Georgia.  The same thing can happen on the inner loop side.  Remove the exit from the beltway to Georgia avenue North.  Convert the existing ramp from the beltway to Georgia avenue South into a normal intersection to allow for left turns onto Georgia there.  They're already is a signal there so the traffic impact on Georgia would be minimal but it would greatly reduce the amount of weaving on the beltway which is the most dangerous part of the current configuration.  The result of all of this would mean that traffic from Georgia to the beltway would still be by way of making right turns and for traffic exiting the beltway they would face a traffic signal which will allow drivers to make either left or right turns.

The stretch of Georgia right through there is itself pretty terrible.  Plans for widening are certainly needed but they don't have to be part of a diverging diamond which would only jam up traffic further even with a road widening.  A widening would also make the whole street safer as I don't think anybody is happy with the reversible Lane although we all understand it's necessity given the heavy directional traffic along this street.  Without the reversible Lane we could have a proper left turn pockets at Forest Glen which also exacerbates the traffic in the area during non-rush hours when left turns block the left lane.  If both sides of Georgia between the beltway and 16th Street were four lanes each, traffic would be a lot smoother.  Northbound the right lane would force traffic onto either direction of the beltway leaving three lanes to continue to Forest Glen and further north.  Southbound one can easily envision two lanes to 16th Street and two lanes to Georgia.",t2_4f6kngqx,ZookeepergameNo5676,0,1647956779.0,0,t1_i1ns4b3,i1ns4b3,True,mpoltan03,t3_tjp8f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tjp8f0/diverging_diamond_at_georgia_avenue_i495_proposed/,Diverging Diamond at Georgia Avenue & I-495 - Proposed in MoCo’s Georgia Avenue Corridor Master Plan,/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tjp8f0/diverging_diamond_at_georgia_avenue_i495_proposed/i1ns4b3/,4,r/MontgomeryCountyMD,0,4
"Auctions.

May not be for everyone, but we set the parameters of the neighborhood and location we wanted, baseline must haves, and set aside an amount to clean up/renovate what was necessary.

Once relevant properties came up, we go visit as often as needed and assess, decide on a price, and stick to it. Therefore, we didn't need to force ourselves to compete with someone else's offer or write a sob story pleading with the seller--our bid was our bid.

"This is really interesting! I'll check out pubmed for that article :) I think there needs to be more awareness of the PM&R medical specialty among primary care docs as traditionally, this was taken care of by ortho docs.

  


It is similar to the history where ENT (ears, nose, throat) (otorhinolaryngologists) doctors used to also take care of eye problems (now seen by ophthalmologists).

  


There is a large fear of specialty doctors of mid-level encroachment on independent medical practice due to published evidence showing worse clinical care and clinical outcomes by mid-levels versus those by MD/DO care. The cost cutting may work in Canada, but not in the US Healthcare system where the same CPT E/M billing codes are used by mid-level providers, which pay out the same by insurance.

Dunno about dynamic flexion or anything. My Chiropractor checked my reflexes and some orthopedic tests on me, and then checked my range of motion limitations and pain.

I answered this without knowing more about the context of your situation. A lot of folks treat chiropractors as primary care, which is crazy.

He told me he doesn't do all the stuff I may have seen on social media from other Chiropractors and that he does things that actually help people not waste time and money.

I was in pain for months, and I tried different PT clinics with no significant success. Maybe a little, but not all the way. Then I shoveled my car free from the snow a month or so ago and I had been in agony for like a week. I tried medication. Nothing worked. I couldn't take care of my cats or anything. Then I saw my Chiropractor and he didn't even have to put his hands on me, instructed me in doing certain specific movements, and my pain got better just in that one visit. It was incredible!

He saw me only that one time and I hadn't had any issues since. Best I've felt in a year, and the only time he touched me was to test my reflexes.

"Maybe see an orthopedic surgeon instead of a chiropractor if this is for a musculoskeletal complaint. 

There is a lot of quackery and lack of real scientific evidence that follows the practice of traditional chiropractic beliefs.

I'm obviously against chiropractors who claim to treat non-musculoskeletal issues with 'manipulation', or suggest out of pocket treatment using 'stem cell therapqy'.. there is no peer reviewed, scientific evidence with sound research methodology that supports chiropractic practice. If they relieve your pain and you believe it is better than placebo, then great! :) but, I generally do not recommend seeing chiropractors if you have good medical insurance coverage. Treat them as a massage, not as clinical care.

My two cents. Cheers and good luck!

"""Unless reduced speed is necessary for the safe operation of the vehicle""... OP stated the Jeep had its hazards on, which perhaps means the driver had to go slow. I don't imagine going below the limit on a 3-lane road would cause much of an impedence.

Also, where did I suggest going the speed limit was speeding? If that's what you took from my comment I don't know what to tell you.

As anyone who has driven in MoCo for more than ten years can tell you, a lot of things are by-the-book unlawful but are rarely if ever enforced.  Right turns on red without stopping, right turns on red when a posted sign forbids it, drivers ignoring the lane control signals on Georgia and Colesville during PM rush, multiple vehicles blocking curbside lanes with posted ""NO STOPPING ANY TIME"" SIGNS, vehicles blocking crosswalks, blocking the box at red lights, all stuff I've watched MoCo's finest straight up ignore.

Lastly, I've been driving in MoCo for more than 30 years and I never once have been, or heard of anyone being, cited for passing on the right. It happens all day every day on the Beltway, 270, 200, Georgia, Colesville, University, Connecticut, 410, 355, Viers Mill, Norbeck, Shady Grove, basically any given road with more than one lane going in the same direction.

"I tried to order one last year in August. Paid the $25 and like you it never came. What I ended up doing is purchasing a transponder in person. A few places offer them and I actually got mine at Giant (you have to go to the customer service desk). It was $10 there which is credited to the account. You can then go to the EZ pass website and register your transponder to the account you ordered the original with. When you do this, that $25 you paid before will be added as credit on your account and will be used by the transponder you purchased. If the other one ever does come in the mail, it is up to you what to do with it. It can be activated and will use the same balance if ever given to someone or used by yourself.

"My personal favorites:

1. Blockhouse point + Violettes Lock to Penny field lock - a full survey of Moco hiking, starting in a forest along muddy branch, then you get to some great views over the potomac, go down to the canal and get closer to the potomac, and end in the forest again.

2. Seneca creek Greenway trail from Riffle Ford Road to Frederick road - Another good mix of things to see. Cuts through the state park, including the marsh overlook and kingfisher overlook, then you follow Seneca creek for a while, including under a neat railroad bridge with a crashed car below it.

3. Lake Halcyon to Quince Orchard. Starts at a small lake loop covered in informational signs, goes through some nice marshes, forests and fields along muddy branch. I've seen tons of wildlife on this trail, including beavers.

The whole Seneca Greenway trail is fun to explore, it's filled with old abandoned things like building foundations, old pre-50s cars, old farm equipment, and an old shotgun range. Not in like a polluting way, but fun in a way that if gives you something to check out as you hike.

Theres really only two trails I wasn't over fond of:

1. Seneca overlook trail is only worth doing in the winter when the leaves are gone and there aren't a zillion mountain bikers on the trail

2. Hiking the trails that are adjacent to Lake frank is great but there isn't a clean circular trail around the lake and the trail map isn't super helpful",t2_eky680qp,cnpd331,0,1647392008.0,0,t1_i0tq45j,i0tq45j,True,WhiteClawsNoLaws,t3_tey777,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tey777/best_hiking_trails_in_moco/,Best hiking trails in MoCo,/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tey777/best_hiking_trails_in_moco/i0tq45j/,8,r/MontgomeryCountyMD,0,8

"I hope you have an awesome time. Pro tip - when hiking downstream on BG-A, after the steep incline you will pass the emergency exit trail head on your left. Just after that is a section of trail called Purple Horse Beach. It is a sandy almost beach-front area of the Potomac River. There is no tree cover for its entirety. Most overheating emergencies happen here. Be wary or move quickly through if you are already pushing yourself. Additionally, because you will have hiked through mud/dirt just before, the sand sticks to your shoes. Over time this has worn the usually textured rock faces smooth. There is little grip and many people slip on these boulders and suffer minor twists and sprains in most cases. Take care of your footing the most, in this section. Also be advised, the Potomac, while serene and beautiful has a strong central current that can travel upwards of 25 mph on a calm day (when snow melt or storms haven't recently occurred). Swimming is forbidden and dangerous. When I was volunteering, there were approximately 9 fatalities on average per year on the Potomac. Many of them were drownings due to incapable people trying to swim the river.

Not trying to scare you off with all this information, but many people ruin a good hike with being unaware and unprepared. They do not expect such extreme conditions in MoCo.

"All types of marked and unmarked trails in Patuxent State park.  This park lies along the Patuxent river that is the border between Montgomery and Howard counties.  At the river any road crossing has at least a small parking area nearby.  I recommend parking at route 94 crossing and finding trail heading north on moco side toward Hipsley Mill crossing. This trail is likely not on many maps if any and there is an old log cabin over 20 feet tall along the river and nearby the log cabin there is a separate trail to the northwest away from the river where an old abandoned homestead can be found that is listed on the historical atlas online and has amazing pictures of what the house looked like 75+ years ago.  In the photos, the home stands in an open farm field in comparison to today with foliage and trees all but hiding the house from view.  Another option is Howard chapel rd crossing or rt 97 crossing.  Near Howard chapel crossing traveling to the north towards the no longer existing part of Elton farm rd I have found an abandoned 1979 honda accord in nearly mint condition other than tires. This is an example of how lightly traveled this area of the park is as there is an abandoned car that has been here for 35+ years that hasn't been vandalized.
