"Sunset & Wupatki are on the same loop road so you may as well do both of them! Walnut Canyon is a bit closer to town. I think you could do all three if you got an early start and were intentional about your time - all three are open from 9-4:30 ish. The main trail at Walnut closes at 3:30 so I’d hit that first and then head to the others. There’s also a pass that’s $45 I think that gets you into all three Flagstaff Area National Monuments. Hikes at each of these are fairly short and the parks are all related to one another and it’s nice to get a fuller picture of what was going on here at that time. I’m a big fan. 

As I said above, Petrified Forest is amazing, I love it, but with it being 2+ hours outside of Flagstaff, I don’t think it makes sense to do as a part of your Flagstaff day.

"Best vegan/vegetarian spots imo are MartAnne’s Burrito Palace (Mexican), Red Curry (Thai), or Brandy’s Cafe (breakfast/lunch). Mama Burger has a really good locally made veggie burger and some dope shakes. 

Cool stuff around flag and Sedona…can’t go wrong picking a hike. Fat Man’s loop is nice and short, easy for a pup and mostly shaded.

"I am so encouraged by your thoughtful post.  I am just a mom of 3 with extended family that has NEVER been supportive or helpful. May I start by saying that the Flagstaff area is going to be very difficult in terms of accessibility for anyone in a wheelchair.  We were up last weekend and one of our kids even commented on the streets being uneven and not very easy to be “steady” on.  It sounds like your sister-in-law has her hands full.  I think it might be the best case scenario to hire a babysitter to cover the kids who either can’t or shouldn’t attend certain events.  Maybe tap the NAU resources for a student who is training in the area of special education?  It would probably be money well spent and is likely the best way to allow for your other family members to have some down time.  Also remember your sister-in-law is rigidly schedule driven every day of her life. She may even appreciate the idea of just having a day or two where nothing is scheduled, but having a care giver on hand even on those days to help entertain the kids would allow her to relax but still in the mix enough to know the kids are being taken care of.

"So the Pit is off of lake Mary road and is a little west of walnut canyon. The parking area is around the following blurb from Mountain Project: “Drive south of Flagstaff on Lake Mary Road. The new Pit and Sandys Canyon Trail head is located just west on Lake Mary Rd. from the old parking area at Canyon Vista Campground. When driving out Lake Mary Rd. look for the dirt road just after the Hecketthorn neighborhood.”

I’d also recommend walking Kelly canyon by Kachina Village neighborhood and bring microspikes. Road may not be open though. 

OP, if you have a high clearance vehicle and go to Priest Draw, there’s nice flat trails that go back through the draw. It’s gorgeous too

"If you’re a bit of a foodie, highly recommend Pizzicleta (you can have their pizza at Dark Sky). Not everyone’s thing, but if you want some killer Neapolitan style pizza, it doesn’t get much better. Fratelli’s is great if you’re after classic American staples. New Jersey Pizza is good, but you may or may not get your pizza within a few hours of ordering it. NiMarcos is a very specifically kind of pizza that only used to exist in ski towns. I’m not sure why that type of pizza is found strictly in places that have ski resorts nearby, but it’s there. 

Annex is pricier, but does some pretty good food, too. 

Really depends what you’re after.

I’m actually in Tucson now, my hometown. It’s much more affordable and has more of the Flagstaff vibe than Phoenix. But it doesn’t compare to Flagstaff IMO. Winters are amazing here but the summers can be rough. 

Despite the cost of living, flagstaff is a really cool place to live and I highly recommend sticking around there if you can swing it. There’s a lot of free dispersed camping available a few miles from town and it’s gorgeous (if not still very cold right now!). But do consider you may still have to contend with snowstorms for 2 more months so that could get complicated with camping. The following link will give you map that has dispersed camping marked on it. You can camp for 2 weeks at a time in one spot. Oh and Avenza is an app that will allow you to use the maps if you’d prefer that to a pdf :)

"Howdy, 

You definitely have a pretty solid itinerary already. If you have a car that is capable, check out the inner basin of the San Fransisco peaks - Shultz Pass is pretty popular (though, I am sure the recent snow might make that a little hard). A small hike I always enjoy doing is the Sinclair Wash Trail, on the urban trail system. It goes pretty far back into the forest, too, and has a fun little labyrinth near the trailhead!

If you’re looking for eats, Momma Burger has some solid diner-style burgers + fries. If you like pizza, NiMarcos is definitely work checking out. Pizzicelta is nice, but a bit pricey. Are you wanting to go to bars? In downtown I would recommend Dark Sky Brewery or Pay N’ Take. 

To answer your last question, I think it is more a City thing. I’ve lived in AZ my whole life (Phx for 18 years) and there’s nothing quite like Flagstaff anywhere else in this state. I personally think it’s the proximity to the largest pine forest in North America! Anyway, enjoy your trip!

"I know all of this because I went under contract last year to buy one of the few remaining parcels in that area. The original owners had bought it back in the early 2000s and got caught by the financial issues of 2008 which ended their efforts to develop the property from what we could see. They had been trying to sell it for some time at a greatly reduced price. We figured something was up due to the price, so we did a deep dive with the County regarding the parcel and the surrounding area which included the Rio de Flag waterway.

The County Community Development employees were extremely helpful in revealing a number of issues that would make building on the property a dicey affair even under the best circumstances, so we bailed. One of the things that the Environmental Engineering folks at the County provided us was the LIDAR survey they did. The owners of the parcel knew nothing about it, but we were kind enough to provide a copy to them so they could disclose it for the next buyer - and there was a ""next buyer"" who has gone so far as to permit a home and septic system on the property. It remains to be seen if they'll get approval, however.

We didn't see this as a viable option and didn't want to end up owning two acres of park land with a beautiful view.

"Federal flood plain maps are not updated with any regularity. What is, however, are local maps or elevation certificates. These are the only real ""source of truth"" when it comes to flood plain information relative to a given parcel.

Even better, the County conducted a LIDAR survey of the Ft. Valley area in 2015, and as a result, made significant changes to the required setbacks for the Rio de Flag waterway, rendering a number of parcels unbuildable due to their proximity to the waterway.

While there are plenty of homes being built in that broad meadow, it WILL flood again and again, however, the 100 year mark is considered something like one or two feet above the ground, so as long as the home's floor is one foot above the flood level, you're good to go.

All I can say is that those homeowners, all of which still have to carry Federal flood insurance if they hold a mortgage, are rolling the dice.

"Hey there, just wanted to let you know that your information may be inaccurate.

According to the City of Flagstaff, there’s 5 new wells planned within the City over the next 10 years. The City is estimates we are currently using 66% of the sustainable aquifer. Sustainable defined as what volume of water Flagstaff could pump and be continually sustained for 100 years without negative consequences to the environment. The estimate is based on research by USGS, Arizona Department of Water Resources, and a 3rd party consultant.

Additionally, the McAllister Well and Pumphouse (West Flag) came online in February 2021. This was followed immediately by the completion of a new well at Ft Tuthill (Fort Tuthill #2).

"I take exception to a couple of points you've made:

1.) An increase in interest rates, short of being multiple points, will only take people on the fringes of the market out of the running. Most buyers who are qualified will continue to be in the market, albeit at a possibly slightly lower price point. A change in a point in mortgage rates isn't that big of a shift for most.

2.) Look at many of the home sales in Flagstaff and you'll see that quite a few are likely cash sales. Cash is king, and with people coming from outside the area where property values were even higher, such as CA or WA, for example, a mortgage isn't an issue, or if it is, it's likely for far less than the property value as the buyer are bringing their equity. That or the buyer is an institutional investor buying the property as an investment (rental).  


The ""doom and gloom"" just isn't there. This is likely the new normal for some years to come until inventory increases in most markets. There will be more pressure in markets like Flagstaff due to the limitations imposed by a lack of land for development and a strong market for investment properties - this will likely never change.

As an aside, many companies with brick and mortar are realizing that a benefit in high demand by job seekers is the ability to work remotely. As a result, the effort to continue with a remote workforce will remain high and may even increase over time, I believe. A former employer has recently changed their policies in regard to remote work because they realized candidates were choosing other employers due to the potential for having to return to work in the office with this employer.",t2_cflwdbkh,MortonRalph,0,1647881756.0,0,t1_i1ju0oa,i1ju0oa,False,Dirty_Boat_Boy,t3_tj467j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/tj467j/flagstaff_housing_march_2022/,Flagstaff Housing - March 2022,/r/Flagstaff/comments/tj467j/flagstaff_housing_march_2022/i1ju0oa/,2,r/Flagstaff,0,2

Treysean Michael Anthony Ware, 26, was arrested for allegedly fatally shooting 26-year-old Frankie James Jackson in the street outside Collin Irish Pub & Grill near LeRoux Street and Route 66 around 1 a.m. Sunday, according to Flagstaff police spokesman Sgt. Odis Brockman.

Witnesses told police the two men were fighting outside the bar when Ware shot Jackson twice, Brockman said. He was taken to the Flagstaff Medical Center, where he later died. No one else was injured.

Ware was taken into custody shortly after, Brockman said. He was booked into the Coconino County Detention Facility on suspicion of second-degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon, disorderly conduct with a weapon and drug charges....  The investigation remained open Sunday morning, Brockman said. However, he noted that police were not looking for any additional suspects.""

"I’m 20 minutes east of Flag with zero options other than expensive satellite with terrible reviews.  I preordered Starlink when I moved here in August, but I’m still waiting. The T-Mobile home internet was available here a few months ago, but when I finally decided to pull the trigger, it wasn’t. I know some people have it and love it. I guess it was only available to a limited number of households, but I’m not sure it would work for me anyway.  We had T-Mobile phones when we moved here. We had 5g with great download speeds, but nearly 0 upload, and lots of dropped calls. 

I have heard good things about Bluespan. I’m not sure where in Flagstaff they are available, but I was impressed when I tried to sign up and they sent me a personal apology for not being out here. They are in the process of expanding. 

Here’s what I did that works: 

I signed up for Visible wireless on a cheap Android phone. Join a ‘party’, and the service is $25/month. You get unlimited hotspot for one device at a time- so that’s a Wi-Fi extender. With the cheapest home WeBoost cell signal booster, It gets 4 bars LTE, 5 if sitting directly on the booster.  I’m in the middle of nowhere- the Visible phone gets good 5g in town.

All the gadgets - Roomba, Ring Cameras, etc are on that extender’s Wi-Fi.  We can usually stream one tv too, but occasionally it doesn’t want to cooperate.  

When the ‘Wi-Fi phone’ is too overloaded, my husband streams tv from his Visible phone hotspot with no problem.  I work from home and tether mine to the computer.  Everything works but Zoom meetings, which are glitchy unless I turn my video off.  Boss requires video on, so I added a few gigs of prepaid T-Mobile data on dual sim and solved that.  

If you’re in town, you could probably get enough internet with one Visible 5g phone and a Wi-Fi extender.",t2_4c28tqsl,Rude_Squirrel_9316,0,1647663055.0,0,t1_i18sve6,i18sve6,True,QuinV03,t3_thfyck,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/thfyck/internet_provider/,Internet Provider,/r/Flagstaff/comments/thfyck/internet_provider/i18sve6/,5,r/Flagstaff,0,5

"That’s fair. I support law enforcement, I understand why the forest gets shut down and it’s unfortunate and bad for the forest in my opinion. I do understand that many forest fires are caused by humans, but even if they were natural we do our best to stop the fire because somebody built their house in the middle of a forest. The forest needs to burn, preferably naturally and not human caused. But it needs to burn. We are already in a drought but these fires will keep coming  back and worse until it’s burned. Look at California/Oregon those trees need to burn, it’s part of a cycle and those fires have gotten very dangerous. I have a few wildland fire fighter friends and California is gonna need to just burn one of these years and get a fresh start.",t2_9rdxbk0u,Shitboxatwork,0,1647296083.0,0,t1_i0o9wp6,i0o9wp6,False,corpseplague,t3_tdcflr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/tdcflr/what_is_your_guess_when_the_forest_roads_will_open/,What is your guess when the forest roads will open?,/r/Flagstaff/comments/tdcflr/what_is_your_guess_when_the_forest_roads_will_open/i0o9wp6/,1,r/Flagstaff,0,1
"The state yes.  And as I understand it Alaska has borough's instead of counties. Coconino would be the 13th largest Borough in Alaska.  As it stands it's the 2nd largest county in the US by area. 

But Alaska is also much wetter than Coconino.  Alaska as a whole gets 31-35 inches of precipitation annually it looks like.  Coconino as a whole gets around 15 inches annually.  Obviously this changes based on where you are at.  Flagstaff gets more than some other areas.  But there are parts of Alaska that get over 100 inches of rain annually. So I'm kinda using just the overall averages here.  

It gets harder to prove a point one way or another here as well, because I just don't have the data.  How many enforcement people do each of those borough's have? And how does that relate to the number of people who go out in said areas.  Are the areas that people typically go out to enjoy just a small portion of that borough? I would think there are parts of the Yukon borough people are more inclined to be visiting and camping in. 

As of 2019 Coconino county had around 65 certified deputies.  Reminder that these deputies have to also serve as the general policing force for the small towns around the county as well (such as Munds Park). And it appears there are around 20 forest rangers for enforcement.  Search and Rescue is almost all volunteers.  

With more funding having people self report may be possible.  But I know, from experience, that if you call 911 from Munds Park a deputy will take anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours.  And if you call the non-emergency line, they may show up next day.  They have a local fire department, but they aren't equipped for going deep into the forest if need be.  They are primarily emergency services for the homes and their stretch of the freeway.",t2_nxl1y,Bluewolf83,0,1647295691.0,0,t1_i0o905m,i0o905m,False,corpseplague,t3_tdcflr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/tdcflr/what_is_your_guess_when_the_forest_roads_will_open/,What is your guess when the forest roads will open?,/r/Flagstaff/comments/tdcflr/what_is_your_guess_when_the_forest_roads_will_open/i0o905m/,1,r/Flagstaff,0,1

"I mean, if the forest service and the county had the manpower to respond to the amount of calls it would get maybe.  But the county sheriff and the forest service have 1.85 million acres (Coconino National Forest) or 18600 square miles (Coconino County) of area.  

I also tend to agree that the ones who are ignoring the campfire regulations are probably also not caring about road closures. But I would argue that the forest being open can also lead to the possibility of not being able to evacuate people in time.  Fires move fast when it's dry. 

It's second hand and anecdotal, but I have been told it's easier to evacuate out people illegally in the forest.

"I grew up here.  I have lived here over 25 years.  I don't mind people ""exploring the trees"" as you put it.  I want people to enjoy the forest as I have done and continue to do to this day.  

But I believe the safety of the Flagstaff populations takes precedence over those who come up here to camp, yes.  Why? Because myself, and others, constantly see those who come up to enjoy the forest, have no care for the forest, or any care for those who have to actually deal with the outcomes of their decisions.  Because I haven't seen any of them up here filling or placing sandbags to deal with flooding from a human caused wildfire; or helping neighbors to pack up and evacuate their homes.

Not unlike in the winter, when the people who come up to enjoy the forest are also the ones leaving broken sleds just lying around for us locals to clean up. I have seen where they just throw their trash on the ground. Or perhaps they are the ones ignoring the blocked forest service roads because they just have to take their ATV out in the forest, ripping up the roads, and destroying the land. Or is it the people parking on roads illegally, even when told not to, and dying. 

They are the same people who come up here and start fires.  Like I posted elsewhere, last year over the Memorial day weekend there were near 80 illegal campfires that were discovered by the county and forest service.  That's just in 3 days.

And you know what, those were on years when we far more snow than this year (though still far less than annual average).

Looking at these links we should average 100+ inches of snowfall.  As of today we are at 54.4 inches since September 1st.  We should be closer to 76 inches at this point in time.  That's near two feet of snow we are short on.  That also does not include how much warmer and drier it has been this winter outside of those few storms, which have prematurely caused our snowpack to melt off.

Does that mean they won't open, no.  I suspect the forest service and the county will open for memorial day, like they do every year to grab the tourists.  [2021 80 illegal campfires over memorial day weekend](http://gcmaz.com/kaff-news/kaff-news/coconino-national-forest-reports-nearly-80-illegal-campfires-over-memorial-day-weekend/) Even with being under no campfire restrictions, fines, and possible jail time; we still see campfires and the beginning of possible major fires almost every year.  And that doesn't include any lightning sparked fires.

I was 19 in 2002 as the Rodeo-Chedeski fire (June 18) burned up 300000 acres threatening the eastern half of N. AZ and was caused by humans. I was watching on 2006 from work as the Brins Mesa Fire (June 18) burned up Oak Creek Canyon, caused by humans. I remember and have helped to deal with the aftermath of the Schultz fire (June 20) from 2010, started by humans. I was here in 2014 when the Slide fire (May 20) happened and burned up the canyon, started by humans. In 2021 I watched the Slate fire (June 7, humans likely cause) and the Rafael Fire (June 18, lightning) threaten Flagstaff and my friends and family.  And those are just the major fires. This is not counting the many small fires, only a few acres that we get multiple of, per year, [60-100 according to the City of Flagstaff](https://www.flagstaff.az.gov/DocumentCenter/View/44186).

I also have friends who are firefighters in and around Flagstaff.  I have friends whose parents were firefighters and fire chiefs in Flagstaff in my teenage years.  I watched as they had friends die in the Yarnell Hill fire in 2013.

So you will have to forgive me if I don't wish to see my forest, which I love and have enjoyed for 25 years, go up in flames due to the stupidity of others. That I don't wish to see my home, my family's home and my friends homes threatened by fire yet again. That I don't wish to have to explain to my son, daily, why we can't go outside due to the air conditions (smoke) from a fire caused by some dumbasses, or that the reason mommy and daddy are nervous is because we are at a yellow (set) stage  of evacuation from that fire (Rafael Fire).

"When the forest service deems it safe for both people and the forest to do so.  They don't want people in there while it's too wet destroying the ground and they don't want people getting stuck that they have to rescue.

On the flip side, we have had so little snow this year, they may decide not to open at all due to the major increased fire risk, especially after last year's fire season and the fact we had Flagstaff on ready to evacuate/evacuated.  

Usually they don't open until early May at the earliest, often not until a couple weeks into May.  I will be honest, I'm hoping they don't open up, and that the fines are quite large for those who break the rules (there are many who ignore the closures every year because they feel they don't apply to them and their atv's and/or campers).  It's anxiety inducing enough knowing the fire risk is high.

"There is no great espresso in town. Firecreek used to be basically okay, but it's gone way downhill. Everywhere else is deeply mediocre. I don't really understand how a town can have so many semi-snooty coffee shops and yet really no good espresso at all.

If you want a tasty espresso drink, Macy's Special is a good mocha; a dirty golden milk at Kickstand is nice, too; perfectly adequate lattes at Late for or Lux or Firecreek. Realistically, just about anywhere w baristas who can steam milk competently can make a good espresso drink.

The lack of basically decent actual espresso, though, has not stopped being puzzling to me. Drier air? Harder water? Not a lot of baristas who care about espresso? Shitty roasting technique?

"My thoughts in no particular order.

Fratelis: generally pretty solid wings.

Nimarcos: best of the pizza places in my experience. 

Oreganos: hit or miss. Really good when they are properly cooked and sauced but that's few and far between. 

ATL: tried once and never again. Overcooked and soggy. 

Sportsmans: solid wings for sure. I despise  bars in general but they make a solid wing. Only been here once though.

Lumberyard: okay wings the few times I tried. I expected better. From such a popular place. 

BWW: I won't say no but I won't seek it out. 

In general I think wing quality has gone downhill across the board since covid hit. Call it the labor shortage or the wing shortage but I've had some bad orders the last year or so.

"The key to snow driving is that you want to avoid any sudden moves. Don't hit the brakes, leave a lot of space between you and others and use steady slow pressure on the brakes. Don't hit the gas pedal, slow steady acceleration is better. No sudden yanks on the steering wheel. Make sure your tires are aired up, you have washer fluid that is rated for cold weather and give yourself extra time to get where you are going.  

It likely wont be too bad so don't panic yourself overthinking just slow down and stay calm.

Also on the off chance you end up having the anti-lock brakes kick in. It will sound awful, vibrate like nothing you have ever experienced before. Do Not! I repeat Do Not take your foot off the brake. Maintain steady slow pressure until you stop.

"The roads will probably be fine when you’re here but if you are in bad snow you mainly need to slow down, below the speed limit, and hive a lot more space between the car in front of you. Try to brake before you get to the ice patches and brake gently. Also try not to make tight turns and not turn too hard on ice/snow. If there is a whiteout turn on your fog lights and hazards so that other cars can see you. And make sure you have antifreeze windshield fluid so that you can clean the slush off your windshield (while driving, this doesn’t replace a snowbrush). If your car gets snow on it while parked clear the front and back all the way off so you can see and the top off so it doesn’t fly onto other people’s windshields.

The worst time to drive in the snow here in Flagstaff is when it gets really cold at night and everything turns into ice. “Spring” snow like this doesn’t stick to the roads as much because it’s warm out so you won’t have to worry as much about sliding. That being said sometimes warm snow has big flakes and it can hurt visibility. So if you’re concerned about that just look at the daily forecast and try not to be on the road during peak snowy times. Don’t be afraid to pull over and wait things out because it won’t snow for very long like that and you can always grab a coffee and wait it out. 😁,t2_4bi9qwqr,IndigoStef,0,1646764511.0,0,t1_hzvbgro,hzvbgro,True,SuggestionIll7385,t3_t9im7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/t9im7f/driving_advice/,Driving advice?,/r/Flagstaff/comments/t9im7f/driving_advice/hzvbgro/,5,r/Flagstaff,0,5

"Okay, dude. NW of Schultz Pass there are almost no named trails (like, Overlook and Secret, which are basically W, and Weatherford and Waterline), and what there is is 100% hikeable. NW of Schultz Peak is, more or less, Inner Basin: mostly wilderness area w/out bikes. I've scrambled a bunch of steep trackless lines back in there, and there are some beautiful and squirrelly use trails. NW of Schultz Creek is a large chunk of the named and graded trail system (though more of it is ENE). There are a couple optative lines that are chutes here and there, but all the named trails of the system are 100% hikeable and pretty easily so. I really have no idea what you're trying to say.

Maybe you dropped a couple chutes on the bike and rode away w the misimpression that a person hiking couldn't go up those sections, or that you were on the primary instance of the trail (for the real barrels)?

The whole Elden-Schultz-Snowbowl trail complex is multi-use.

"That’s true. And once they started doing mandatory mid-way unloads on windy days… that helped dramatically with wind closures.

I guess the biggest issue was that Sunset felt like it was closed more often than open. Those runs off of Sunset bake in the sun all day long, so for a good chunk of the season that lift was closed. And on the days Agassiz had to close as well… there was nothing to do on the mountain.

Actually haven’t rode on Sunset in probably over a decade, so I’m not sure if it is better over there now that they got snowmaking.

"Road riding in town with all the snow piled up will suck, but if it all melts, you’ll likely be faced with very loose berms due to all the cinders. 

Forest roads need anywhere from 3 weeks to a month of no moisture to dry out. This also depends on temps. If it’s consistently cold, the snow will hang longer and make forest roads stay muddier longer. If it’s consistently warm, the snow will melt quickly and then it’ll take two weeks of no moisture to dry out the forest roads (if they are on the south side of hills). 

In my experience, if there is snow around there will be mud, and it’ll suck.

"Second this. Catholic Charities has housing options specifically for folks exiting the justice system or on probation or parole. It's for individuals though- they serve families in other programs. The re-entry homes are more geared as a stepping stone onto permanent housing solutions. 
Your first step will be to complete Front Door with either Catholic Charities or FSS. It's an hourish conversation to direct you to as many housing resources as possible at once. That way you don't have to do the run around. The process is the same at Flag Shelter and Catholic Charities for Front Door. You also can identify any way to work with Catholic Charities- they serve all.
The transitional housing above is Anew Living. I'm not sure if they have an opening but worth a place on the wait list.

>I'm not trying a gotcha question.. you jumped from conservatives whining to what I said about the district uses cdc guidelines to fox news to white supremacist news casters...

You were not trying to ask a gotcha question. Okay, fair enough. How is what you wrote after this related? You were not trying a gotcha question because...I was changing subjects after your question? You are making a statement, then trying to back up that statement with something unrelated. Is it because that is the order of the topics from my post?

>My point was just because politics invade pretty much everything, doesn't make it bullshit.

True. I agree. What I said was: Politics invading **this particular topic** (masks) makes it bullshit. Politicians clearly care more about winning reelection than the welfare of their constituents. They care more about staying in power and enriching themselves, than doing the right thing. That is some truly fucked up bullshit. Until we have a system where politicians cannot get rich in office by taking legalized bribes, this will continue to happen. A donor with a check for $1,000,000 has more sway over politicians than a group of scientists with facts. That millionaire donor is likely a hyper-capitalist who wants everything to go back to normal so they can go back to making unnecessary amounts of money exploiting the labor of the poor. Rich antisocial oppressors should not be the ones making the decisions for politicians, but they are.

No worries! I find them to be a lot of fun! I generally see Kikori as a good 'starter' anime con for first timers since it's so small. For those more invested in the fandom I really recommend Saboten down in Phoenix. It's in the same network of conventions as Kikori (So you will see the same panelists at times) but it's quite a bit larger and usually has more guests and things to do. Phoenix Fan Fusion is also a really fun conventional comic-con type deal that should also be on people's radar!,t2_75b11e82,morlock_hg,0,1646248829.0,0,t1_hz34vkw,hz34vkw,False,LtSquash,t3_t55ync,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/t55ync/local_animecomic_con_this_weekend/,Local Anime/Comic Con This Weekend,/r/Flagstaff/comments/t55ync/local_animecomic_con_this_weekend/hz34vkw/,2,r/Flagstaff,0,2

"Typically there are panels for a variety of topics relating to conventions in general, cosplay, specific series and fandoms, etc. Mostly just talking about and celebrating various aspects of anime and adjacent fandoms. There is usually a vendor hall for anime/japanese/otaku related merch. A gaming room for popular video and board games. Sometimes tournaments for fighters like Smash, or Magic the Gathering in the board game space. There are also voice actors for various anime or popular webseries that usually show up, but I imagine due to COVID and Kikori being relatively small there aren't a whole lot of guests this time.

If you're at all interested and can afford the ticket I recommend going for at least a day and checking it out. At worst you get a fun people watching experience with the different cosplays, and an opportunity to buy some anime merch at the vendor hall.

"I don't think you realize you are making my point for me, do you? Science says climate change bad, politicians do nothing. Science says N95 masks are needed for Omicron, politicians do nothing. The CDC is a home for scientists, but ultimately, their recommendations are based on pressure from the late-stage capitalist hell-hole of a government we have. The EPA is home for climate scientists, but ultimately, their recommendations are based on pressure from politicians. The scientists are not the policy and recommendation makers. Those are made by people more concerned about being popular than being ethical.

It's funny. The problem is not that your false equivalency arguments are bad. The problem is that they are so bad, any elementary age student could see through them. But for some reason, you can't?

"4th street vintage is the new antique store some people have mentioned. It’s the same owners of the older antique store; they just moved. 

They have a bunch of records (and even some great ones). BUT… and a huge but- they are super expensive! I go there pretty often and have only ever bought maybe three records. All a bit more than they were worth.
They have just about every album priced for mint/near mint but quality is often poor/good. Really only worth it if you have more dollars than sense or you like to just flip through. So, in summary, if you want records at a good price you won’t find it there.

Edit: even our thrift stores (especially goodwill) are over priced with records.

"There used to be a speakeasy downtown, but it closed couple years back (was too well hidden for tourists I think funny enough 😄) but the following should get you started:

Uptown Pubhouse definitely has best selection of whiskey of all types, well over 200 with many limited pours (also billiards, shuffle board, darts, food, etc). 

Next would probably be Flag Brew (they'll even sell you a bottle if you end up loving it). Plus they brew their own beer.

Best whiskey cocktails, or cocktails in Flag really (real mixologists with great concoctions) The Annex Bar, surprisingly good food too. Try the ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" smoked whiskey drink.
