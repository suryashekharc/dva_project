Fortunately it all worked out, but really thought ""WTF?  how about a bit of warning next time?""  Surprises when driving are never welcome!!

It’s time the city puts a tax on the ballot to fix the roads and infrastructure instead of more cops and firefighters? This is a question not a smart ass comment. Where does a city put its money towards? It sure is not a easy thing. You can make everyone happy all the time. Do we want trash pickup? Bulk pickup? Hazardous waste drop off? Snow plowing? Airport running? Pot holes fixed? Old sewer lines replaced? New water lines installed? Maybe a upgrade or replacement of the 94 year old water plant? But let’s do all of it and more! Let’s do everything each and everyone desires!

"You're not wrong. It's the kind of work that attracts a certain kind of people. You could probably say the same when it comes to Catholic priests, Boy Scout leadership, even locally in Johnson County a few years ago when a music store had a staff member charged with child sex abuse. It was an atmosphere where parents were paying for a month worth of lessons, sitting outside in their car and waiting for their son or daughter to come out of a private music room where the lesson was conducted. The atmosphere should give off some red flags. The scenario. Maybe it's not this particular program but maybe it's just a larger problem the parents are signing kids up for some sort of camp or class or event and not recognizing but the environment and the way that organizations are set up is the danger, not necessarily the individuals working with kids on the whole. My greatest lesson from the pandemic was that I need to be far more involved on a one-on-one level with my children and what they are learning. Not only so I can reinforce with their teacher teaches what's so I can dear them when I think things are going astray. Don't need a summer school or a camp or a program to teach my children how to pray or how to build friendships with other kids that share their spiritual values.

"I feel like this is a very emotionally-biased statement you’ve made here.  I’m no fan of Kanakuk by any means, but I like to think there’s often more to any story.  I feel like Kanakuk was well-intended and still is, but have had a few bad apples in their ranks due to exceedingly poor management practices.  

There are two sides to every story, but after a cursory scroll, something tells me that “factsaboutkanakuk” probably operates more within a biased realm than an objective one.  They clearly have an agenda they’re pushing.  Obviously the kanakuk name is fouled and it’s hard to shake something like that, so they’ve rebranded a bit because everyone loves to jump on the bandwagon of hating on entities that were even slightly tied to wrongdoing.  I don’t see this as a deceptive maneuver on their part.  

I’m no expert on your topic here, just reading it at face value.  Generally speaking from the outsider’s prospective though, spiritually-oriented youth groups have an awful reputation for a reason… kanakuk certainly wouldn’t be the first of that type of organization to have abuse and scandal within its ranks.  Scandal and abuse are kinda of a religious organization specialty

The bottom line is that putting your kids into spiritual youth group type scenarios is putting them into scenarios where they’re going to be indoctrinated in some kind of way, either actively or passively.

"Somewhere outside?

Or the at-risk person wearing an N95 the entire time while their inside?

Even if you found a bar/restaurant that enforced masks, people just take them off while they’re eating or drinking. COVID spreads through both aerosols and droplets. Droplets fall to the ground, so social distancing in that circumstance may or may not be effective (keep in mind the six feet rule was based on a study of the FLU in the 1960s at the University of Wisconsin). But aerosols just circulate through the air. So wearing a mask from entering the restaurant and then taking it off once you sit down is not an effective or significant way to reduce COVID transmission. 

Unfortunately, I have yet to hear of a single Federal, State, or Local government encouraging, let alone funding, indoor spaces to upgrade to state of the art HVAC systems to improve airflow and reduce aerosol virus transmission, which is the one thing that would actually help in a bar/restaurant situation. 

Regardless, the only restaurant in KC that overhauled their HVAC system to improve airflow and aerosols is Corvino Supper Club. They shut down their restaurant for month to install the new system. They don’t require masks, but in my opinion, like I said before, they’re pretty much useless in a restaurant/bar situation.",t2_21ppe1hi,TerrapinTribe,0,1648250272.0,0,t1_i24nls5,i24nls5,True,CountingGoldenSheep,t3_to4f57,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/to4f57/help_where_do_we_go/,Help!

"The vast majority of crime can be traced back to some form of survival. A person can of course just be a jackass, or end up after a long time of crime doing it unnecessarily, but most crime starts from a place of struggling.

The US economy is *bad* for most people. Less money with less spending power with fewer opportunities to advance, higher cost of education, and worst social safety nets in generations. Cost of rent and housing is out of control everywhere. 

People make fun of the oligarchs corruption in Russia hurting their military / country so much, but look at the infrastructure and safety of the *average* American - we are not that far removed and have continued to move in that direction for decades now with little pushback, largely due to our own oligarchs lobbying for insane laws that hurt everyone except the top 0.5%. Things like outlawing municipal broadband is a good example. 

You also have things like the police being even more a for-profit institution than it was previously, spending all their resources on certain easy cases that will lead to convictions that will lead to prison, because that makes companies money and is easy for the department(s). That means actual problematic crime for the populace (sexual assault, car break ins, non-speeding dangerous driving) are lower investment because they can be difficult to solve for. Prisons are as crowded as they ever are and tons of people are getting arrested (often for incredibly, blatantly bigoted reasons).

So no, the police have not gone soft on theft. They prioritize it roughly the same as they always have. You know why it's smartest to steal from middle class and poor people? Because that way the police won't put in as much effort. If that car break in group starts targeting neighborhoods along Ward Parkway, we'll see how long they last",t2_acsba,InsanitysMuse,0,1648245179.0,0,t1_i24c5zf,i24c5zf,False,Craiggers324,t3_tnn7nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tnn7nh/kcpd_chief_smith_finally_retiring/,KCPD Chief Smith finally retiring,/r/kansascity/comments/tnn7nh/kcpd_chief_smith_finally_retiring/i24c5zf/,17,r/kansascity,0,17

"The actual issue has very little to do with being able to afford $10, and in fact, charging per hour as others have also suggested would likely result in increased revenue for the city as turnover per day would exceed the flat rate (which isn’t necessarily the objective, as the city wants more foot traffic, less car traffic). Viable alternatives that negate even having to step into a car would make this much less of a talking point (robust mass transit to the suburbs, bike paths, etc). The city is working on it, but we are years, likely decades away from these being viable alternatives. 

My point is that going from free to charging a flat rate of $10 creates a psychological barrier to entry that doesn’t currently exist - a flat $10 charge is far more concrete in the mind than thinking about driving around to find a free spot (or even a metered spot at a low hourly rate), which creates a deterrent to going. 

Is $10 significant in the grand scheme? No. 
Will people think twice about going when they hear/see parking now costs $10, even if there are other places to park that cost less/are still free? Yes.

"The better part of the zipper merge is my example of the 80 cars. It takes up less distance along the roadway, thus reducing congestion. If everyone merges early the merge point is continuously moving away from the lane closure and likely leading to people slowing down or stopping to get into the single lane. That merge point becomes the point of congestion and that continues to move farther and farther away from the closure. This backs up traffic farther away from the original closure thus making the lane closure longer than it actually is. Now in an ideal world the zipper merge is seamless where there is little to no changing of speed, and traffic keeps flowing more quickly into the lane closure. Since we don't live in an ideal world the whole scheme falls apart when drives don't align in the proper spacing for a seamless merge.",t2_h3ihm,mrrchevy3,0,1648236492.0,0,t1_i23r7hp,i23r7hp,False,HugoBossjr1998,t3_tnnnv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tnnnv2/what_is_up_with_people_and_not_understanding_the/,What is up with people and not understanding the “Zipper-Merge”?,/r/kansascity/comments/tnnnv2/what_is_up_with_people_and_not_understanding_the/i23r7hp/,2,r/kansascity,0,2

"You can find the whole budget here: https://budget.kcmo.gov/. The earnings tax makes up $269 million of the city's revenue for 2022, or about 15.7% of the total $1.72 billion budget.

As to why we have an earnings tax - we have a bunch of people that commute into the city to work. These people consume city services (they cause wear on the streets, they use public trashcans, they have police/fire/ambulance service available) but they don't contribute to KC's bottom line via property taxes because they live outside of city limits. The earnings tax captures revenue from those people.

As far as taxes go, it's one of the only ones I'm happy about paying because it goes directly to things in my local area. Federal and state taxes mostly go somewhere else and don't benefit in such a direct & visible way. It isn't earmarked for anything in particular as far as I know, but it does make up 15.7% of the budget.

"It's not really that unique, but the reason large urban core cities like KCMO need 1% taxes is due primarily to white flight, where middle and upper-income white households moved outside taxing jurisdictions (cities/counties and even states in the KS/MO metro divide), so the urban core city has a large gap of missing tax revenue that's not funding infrastructure, and also specific problems unique to urban cores like the relatively high cost of educating all the lower-income households left behind by white flight.

That's been the case since WWII for most large American metros, when white people began moving to places like Prairie Village (one of America's first large suburban tract house planned communities) outside core inner cities.

Think of all the people who live in JoCo and work in KCMO.  (pre-COVID) They're using KCMO street infrastructure daily; the city is hosting and providing utilities to their employers; since they don't live in KCMO their sales tax and state income tax predominantly go to JoCo and KS instead of KCMO and Missouri, etc. So KCMO is a large economic engine that is throwing off huge amounts of income to people both inside and outside KCMO, but only recouping taxes on that income from residents - so a big part of the 1% tax is about collecting the share of tax revenue from people who work but don't live there.  The other part is just taxing residents a little more to pay for the expensive infrastructure/education/policing type stuff that comes with running a large urban core city.",t2_5otyw,cyberphlash,0,1648234096.0,0,t1_i23lca6,i23lca6,True,BardsArentReal,t3_tnq1v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tnq1v8/what_does_the_1_tax_actually_find/,What does the 1% tax actually find?,/r/kansascity/comments/tnq1v8/what_does_the_1_tax_actually_find/i23lca6/,16,r/kansascity,0,16

This allows more traffic to queue closer to the road closure and traffic doesn't backup as far away.

The issue is for the last oh 70 years we have all been trained to see the lane closure sign and then get over, the drivers who didn't get over and sped by everyone was always considered the asshole in a hurry. So now that they want us to stay in two lanes and take our turns merging we've all been trained differently. Drivers also seem to be selfish when doing this process so most drivers think they should go first, or they can cut in line out of turn.",t2_h3ihm,mrrchevy3,0,1648231444.0,0,t1_i23eo66,i23eo66,False,HugoBossjr1998,t3_tnnnv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tnnnv2/what_is_up_with_people_and_not_understanding_the/,What is up with people and not understanding the “Zipper-Merge”?,/r/kansascity/comments/tnnnv2/what_is_up_with_people_and_not_understanding_the/i23eo66/,6,r/kansascity,0,6

"The ""get 3 feet from your bumper"" phenomenon is not typically an aggression thing if you're not in the left lane. Often times people do this either intentionally or unintentionally because they use it as a peripheral vision enhancer so they can browse their phone. If they are close enough to your tail, then they can pay attention to their phone and just follow you blindly. These days it's very common to see 2 cars grouped together like that with nobody around them and plenty of passing room with other lanes available. IMHO I think most of the regressions in traffic patterns in the last decade are due to phone usage in the cars.

"I think price increases for doing things like parking downtown or not offering free parking directly next to the city market is the balance you speak of?

My POV is that of a ""city sleaker"" living in RM. But let me put thing into perspective:

Let's flip the script and say a Michelin Star chef opens a boutique restaraunt with a tiny parking lot right outside of a residential area in Mission KS.

The restaurant is so popular that people from  downtown frequent the restaraunt and start parking in front of the resident's homes regarly blocking their driveways, because the tiny lot has started to overflow. 

Residents complain and the city of Mission states that you will be towed if you park in front of their homes and you must use a public lot a block away.

What you're stating in your OP is that this is somehow *""unfair""* to people from downtown who want to go to the restaurant that they are now being inconvenienced. 

I know it slightly different because of the fact that we chose to live in an entertainment district, but we still **live** here.

Fun fact: living in the river market it's a general rule that you don't move your car between the hours or 8am-4pm every Saturday for 3/4 of the year. It can take upwards of 5 mins just to leave your lot or garage and if you have to get back home during that time period you'll likely have to park 3 or 4 blocks away and walk to your home. 

So why shouldn't people visiting be the ones slightly more inconvenienced than the people who **live** there, are paying local taxes, are paying for parking spaces are parking at their homes and have no choice in the matter?",t2_ho743,lifeinrednblack,0,1648223715.0,0,t1_i22up59,i22up59,True,justathoughtfromme,t3_tn3e2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tn3e2h/how_to_balance_the_desires_of_those_downtown_with/,How to balance the desires of those downtown with those who live outside who want to use the services?,/r/kansascity/comments/tn3e2h/how_to_balance_the_desires_of_those_downtown_with/i22up59/,4,r/kansascity,0,4

Zipper merging is bad but I'm also starting to hate it when you have a stoplight with two lanes to turn left and then an eventual merge to one after the turn.

Thankfully, the year before I started playing Pee-Wee football, the coach for the team was indicted on over 20 charges of sexual assault on a child.  No story could be found.

You don't have to look too far in the entertainment industry and Corey Feldman doesn't look as crazy as he once did now that the Weinstein stuff came out showing that an entire industry will protect its predators.  


I know a few parents that their kids are involved in competitive gymnastics that I have seen put their children in extremely risky situations all amid the Larry Nassar scandal came to light that he was protected for almost 20 years of abuse.  

I believe the risk today is even greater than I was a kid as parents have their kids in too many activities that increase their alone time with adults.  

After being involved in more fraternal or other faith based organizations, the number of sexual abuse stories I heard from kids that involved people in their family should tell you one thing.  This world is set up in a way to pray on our most innocent.  It doesn't matter what the organization is, if it is setup to get time alone for your kids, there is an inherent risk.  

If you are posting this to be purposely malicious to a religious group, I get it, this page is clearly anti-religion and everyone here will support you.  Just know that they have also released their own statement - https://kanakuk.com/our-response/  


Best of luck and teach your kids to be predator proof.  For every 1,000 positive stories, regardless of affiliation, you are going to find at least 5 that have absolutely ruined someone's life.

"I don't think city-dwellers hate suburbanites, but I definitely get the sense they are over catering the development of downtown around people who don't want to live here. Basically everyone I work with lives in the suburbs. They're the first people to tell me we can't have professional stadiums down here due to lack of parking, they don't support extending the street car or expanding the bus system, and they complain about the lack of chain restaurants downtown.  

Over and over again, the city has acquiesced to these people when it comes to developmental plans. A successful city has a thriving downtown area. Cities much much larger than ours manage to have professional stadiums downtown, not in the middle of nowhere. It's a shame we basically have the Lebron James of the NFL and he plays for one of the few cities you can't walk to a game from your downtown condo. All so people who don't even live in the area can park their suburban closer to the restaurant they're going to on the rare occasion they come down here. 

My problem isn't with suburbanites, it is with the city not prioritizing the people who live down here.

"I have to say then, if you yourself admit it is a minority who are making the argument from (what I feel is pretty clearly) emotion, why focus on their point-of-view as the consensus of the city-dweller's position? Or at least frame it as such by presenting the argument as an equal one where the ""pro-parking"" (for lack of a better term) are making reasonable arguments and the ""anti-parking"" are reacting irrationally and emotionally?

If you are upset people are upset and you feel insulted/unwelcome, fine, that makes sense, but you are not really engaging honestly if you are framing the argument you stated above as the argument that needs to be resolved and not one that engages the ""anti-parking"" position from an equally rational perspective.

If you are just looking for insight into why some people who prefer pedestrian-oriented development are frustrated and testy, I honestly don't know where to start? You are aware that almost all development in the US has been so profoundly car-oriented for so long that genuine pedestrian-oriented development tends to strike most Americans as alien?
