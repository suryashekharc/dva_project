"Right. It is great that Wichita has houses like this. But, if the owners are receiving huge appraisal discounts, far below market value, and other properties in much less affluent neighborhoods are having to make up budget shortfalls due to those discounts - that is simply illegal. (Refer to Kansas Statute 79-503a)

Consider a neighborhood of identical properties, and I mean identical, where most average around an appraised value of 120K, but my own is appraised at over 280K (but I paid 70K for it - retaliatory, because of my research), and a county employee next door, who may have paid 150K for a home (identical to my own), but is appraised at 130K, explain to me how that is fair - especially when houses on the market for over 3 million with - pending contracts - are appraised at a million or more below those market prices.  
One of my past research spreads (2016) did result in a KWCH news story that got the whole area re-evaluated. Everyone's tax appraisal went down nicely, as a result.

"This is not about ""Eat The Rich"" - it is about equal treatment under the law, which is not happening in the arena of local property tax appraisals.  
Wichita is not an isolated instance, by any means. Consider the taxes paid by people like Bezos, Gates and others, corporations like Amazon, Apple and others who pay little or none, while the struggling middle class is left the burden.

""If anything, taxes for the lower and middle class and maybe even the upper middle class should even probably be cut further. But I think that people at the high end - people like myself - should be paying a lot more in taxes. We have it better than we've ever had it.""

"okay, I'll let trombone pass.  Well I don't know how much free time you have but the we have a really good zoo as someone else already mentioned.  

If you like Pizza, I'd recommend Il Vicino on Douglass and Hillside.  They specialize in wood fire pizza and the flavor is bomb. They have a relaxing atmosphere and iced tea is great.  

If you want a steak, I think the best for the money is Texas Roadhouse.  Their sides are also fantastic.  Call ahead though.  

If you like BBQ then try pig in..er never mind, try Delano BBQ.  It's close by and it's in Delano so you can experience that. 

For a hamburger, I would say TJ's but they got roaches, so I would go to Ty's.  Ty's is better anyways but last time I was there (a few weeks ago) they will still sitting people every other table....dumb at this point so it was very busy.

"You are welcome. I do stand by my criticism of WSU, though.

More broadly speaking, many if not most social clubs at WSU are a short-term life investment. Fraternity and sorority groups are a clear example of this, but so are things like political and activist groups: you feel good and believe you're fighting the good fight while you do it, but then you have to graduate and WSU welcomes a new class of freshmen to replace you...The same is also true of group related to your studies, but career-oriented groups open your eyes to the professional world and help you realize what you want to do with the next chapter of your life.

Fighting to save the world is great. I spent a lot of college thinking I was doing that, and it was generally a good time. But I was just one person out of, well, everyone who had an opinion. And that didn't stand out when I had to apply for a job.

Look for something you think will help ten years from now.

"Took a quick glance through your profile. Looks like you're not old enough to drink, so I'll leave the breweries and stuff off. There is a pretty sweet arcade downtown and out east a ways there is a place called headshots. It's a full on video game bar and lounge. Five bucks gets you unlimited play all day. You would have to have someone over 21 with you but it sounds right up your alley. There's also a tabletop gaming Cafe next door if you're into that. As for food, it kind of depends on what you're after. When I travel, I go looking for the best burger and best pizza in town cuz I'm a little fat kid. Best pizza to me is Picasso's and that's in the Delano district close to where you are. Best burger has a few options, Dempsey's is good, Bomber burger is great but the dude running it is kind of a dickhead on purpose, Sport burger goes pretty quick too. If you like breakfast/brunch there's a place downtown called Homegrown. It's all farm to table and still the best breakfast food I've had. Our zoo is great. And even though it's geared towards kids, exploration place is pretty cool too. I doubt you'll have the free time and the ability to get there but the cosmosphere out in Hutchinson is incredible. I don't have any answers for you on the nature stuff though. Walking along the river is nice sometimes and comes with an added bonus of having lots of pokestops, if that's your jam.

"Wichita has a long history of food, and for a city of our size we have a ton to offer!

The brewery scene is strong here. Definitely check a few of those out! They have good food, and great house made beer! I can attest Norton's is great, but if you head downtown there is a pretty good amount of things to do and places to eat. Milk Float makes a good cup of coffee and great desserts! If you want a Wichita classic, go get a NuWay before you leave with their homemade root beer and chili. It's a crumbly burger, but very tasty I think. It's a locally own fast food place thats been around forever. You might love it or you might not, but its worth a shot lol. We have a large Vietnamese population as well, and you'll find good Pho on damn near every corner in some places.

If you want to get fancier, The Wine Dive is excellent, as is Vora (more of a Euro Bistro), and we have several nice steak houses in town. My favorite is Scotch and Sirloin, but the fanciest one is probably Chester's Chophouse. There's also Red Rock, but that's a chain I believe, and 6S as well, but that's owned by a wealthy local family that isn't liked very much, so I've never been there. I've heard it's good though. Salt Grass is excellent as well, and is out on the east side, though I think that's a chain as well. If you want a good steak, you definitely can in Wichita lol

"I’m not sure about the Wichita store, but I was in a Joann fabrics the other day in KC that has a corporate issued sticker on the door specifying that they are pet friendly. Each location may vary, but it seems enough of them are pet friendly for them to make an official sign.

The Old Town farmers market was dog friendly last time I went (pre-Covid, but I doubt it’s changed). That was a great place for my pups to learn to behave around people, other dogs, and very tempting smells! The farmer’s market at 21st & Ridge is not dog friendly, though, just so you’re aware.

It’s several months away, but there was an event that we went to a few times pre-Covid. The swimming pool in College Hill had a doggy night at the end of each summer, just before they drained the pool, but that can be a great way of teaching your pup to swim or get used to the water, as you can wade into the pool with your pup.",t2_9xrlo,chestypocket,0,1648137650.0,0,t1_i1y1cfd,i1y1cfd,True,NAraizaHomes,t3_tmbaz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/tmbaz7/dog_friendly_places/,Dog Friendly Places,/r/wichita/comments/tmbaz7/dog_friendly_places/i1y1cfd/,5,r/wichita,0,5

District Taqueria is a great option for upscale soft shell tacos, some killer guac and queso.

HomeGrown is right near there and is a breakfast and early afternoon only place.  Great breakfast and lunch items, recommend getting on the waitlist before heading to it.

Old Mill Tasty Shop has been there forever although I have not eaten there recently.

"Doo Dah diner has, IMO (and many other's as well), the best breakfast/brunch in town. It's a completely scratch kitchen and has the quintessential great plains diner feel.

The Monarch is great for soups, sandwiches, and other bistro type stuff. Public is kinda similar.

Bite Me barbeque is pretty good if that's what you're looking for, if you're from somewhere without a bbq tradition you'll think it's fantastic though.

There's a place not too far north of the arena called El Patio that's just a little hole in the wall mexican place that deserves a mention. It isn't going to knock your socks off, but it's small and charming and everything is consistently good, including great salsa with fresh warm tortilla chips.

Norton's Brewing is a really good microbrewery that also has better than average food and a cool vibe.

Ty's is a good burger place not too far from there.

Picasso is down by the Monarch in Delano and they do pizza by the slice that's quality.

River City Brewery and The Anchor are both just a bit to the east in the old town district and are probably the closest to what you seem to be indicating you're looking for. I personally prefer The Anchor, but be warned that it gets mixed reviews... mostly because the service can sometimes be a little hit-or-miss. I personally love the place.

I haven't driven in Wichita but I'm guessing it's not nearly as bad, as you say. Hopefully that makes it easier for pedestrians, joggers, and bike riders to watch out for them. 

 The inattentive drivers are definitely annoying. Even if they're not glued to their phones they seem to be spaced out and not paying attention. I can see how even in a relatively light traffic city like Wichita it would get frustrating, the adrenaline levels shoot up when one almost gets hit by a bad driver.

There’s a gun!” After he started shooting I booked it into Claire’s and sheltered in their back room for about 20 minutes before heading towards the exit where I was detained by police because I had seen the incident.

"Nothing I've found will actually kill the plant in a single application.

Basically, it's a game of attrition of killing the leaves as they pop up and burning up the plant's energy supply or digging out the tree root sized underground vines that stretch for MILES like underground cable... all without itching your nose or swiping it on your arms and legs.

HOWEVER - there is a magic solution that's about as organic and free-range as you can get and works better and faster than the poison ivy specific roundup.

I like to use a 2 gallon sprayer - they're $5-10 at any hardware store

1. Half pound of salt
2. About a 10 second squeeze of dawn dish soap (or some other heavy grease fighting dish soap)
3. 2-4 cups of vinegar. Household works or you can get a gallon of 45% on amazon that should cover the entire project but be VERY careful not to breathe it or get it on you.
4. Fill up with water (warm water is better)
5. Shaken not stirred - or whatever floats your boat

Exact measurements aren't that important. The vinegar allows for cellular penetration and the soap water allows the salt to stick to the leaf and suck all the moisture out of it (desiccation). A stronger solution (soap, vinegar, salt) isn't better - it won't work as well. You don't have to believe me, try it out... Striking a reasonable balance is important for this to work its magic.

Mornings are great to get a good coat on - just mist them. In a day they'll look crispy and in 2-4 days nearly all the leaves will have fallen off... Roundup takes at least two applcations to get to this stage.

This is where most people stop. Don't. This can and does work better than roundup. If you check out this method on home improvement sites they'll say ""do it until you don't need to."" I've done it... It takes a looooong time.

PS - probably doesn't need to be said but burning SEEMS like a good idea... it's not :D",t2_5twigd0r,donobinladin,0,1647927505.0,0,t1_i1mn70e,i1mn70e,True,ZXVixen,t3_tjsw23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/tjsw23/any_poison_ivy_loving_goats_or_other_methods_to/,Any Poison Ivy Loving Goats (Or other methods to be rid of it?),/r/wichita/comments/tjsw23/any_poison_ivy_loving_goats_or_other_methods_to/i1mn70e/,5,r/wichita,0,5

"I think something like ""displace the police"" works better. The historical record shows that police are nearly universally immune to internal reform. The idea should be to reduce their contact with the public as much as is humanly possible. [Denver's STAR program is a great model for efforts like this.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.denverpost.com/2022/02/20/denver-star-program-expansion/amp/) There are better ways of addressing the bulk of criminal and criminalized behavior than sending armed people to enforce compliance through the barrel of a gun. It's bonkers to me that we send the same people to fix homelessness and drug possession as those we send to address violent crime. 

We're using policing to plug the holes left by decades of disinvestment in public services like housing, addiction treatment and mental health. They're an expensive means of addressing those problem poorly. The fact that police budgets are extremely easy to increase and and impossible to trim down is a non-negligible part of the problem, but that's downstream of the more pressing failures.

"This is what I like to call the threat of living below the law.

Hearing about people ""above the law"" is a lot more common. That is, people who do things with little regard for the consequences because of some combination of their wealth, power, and prestige. Michael O'Donnell is a good local example of this--if he was Joe Schmoe from Valley Center I think he would have met a harsher fate early on.

(For those of you seeking a bipartisan example, there's Casey Yingling conveniently getting a cushy City Hall job as an assistant to the politician she just ran a campaign for.)

Living below the law is something different. You count on cops and prosecutors to take care of problems within their bailiwick. African-Americans in Wichita should justifiably wonder whether they will be appropriately served given these hurtful messages.

Nobody should be surprised by this. There also shouldn't be any surprise that the WPD officers involved didn't get any reprimanding. How many times has a officer of the WPD killed an innocent person or used excessive force and there were no consequences. I remember back in 2011 or 2012 a young girl was hit and killed by an officer speeding through a residential area while responding to a call with no lights or sirens and nothing came of it. Let's not forget the famous Swatting incident where there was like 15 police officers aimed at an unarmed man and one officer fired a shot killing him and claimed 'his life felt threatened' and nothing came of that. I respect police officers because I know it's not an easy day to day job being an officer in today's environment but the WPD is a fucking joke with the way it handles reprimanding officers.,t2_7u7mcltz,DietSnapple9,0,1647874620.0,0,t1_i1jc3k8,i1jc3k8,True,kyouteki,t3_tj9ibu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/tj9ibu/leaked_messages_wichitaarea_officers_sent_racist/,"Leaked messages: Wichita-area officers sent racist memes, talked about shooting people",/r/wichita/comments/tj9ibu/leaked_messages_wichitaarea_officers_sent_racist/i1jc3k8/,13,r/wichita,0,13

"4 methadone clinics in Wichita, all of which will also do buprenorphine (Subutex/Suboxone).  These are daily dosing facilities for the most part, Mon-Sat.  Long intake process there because of federal regulations, so be prepared for a long first day.  I challenge the idea of ""switching addictions"" that others have posted; think about methadone/bup more like switching dependence from one substance to another.  The other substance in this case (methadone or bup) is long-lasting, much safer, and legal.  Each of the methadone programs are required to also provide behavioral treatment; some do more of that than others.  One methadone program takes grant funding (federal subsidy) and insurance, the other 3 don't.  If you're paying out of pocket, you're looking at $10-15/day depending on which med you take.

There are a few medical prescribers doing bup, but not nearly enough.  Safety net clinics, except HealthCore, don't do it.  COMCARE used to but stopped.  Via Christi Family Medicine residency might.  A few independent operators do it but there are caps that limit access.  You can search for prescribers at SAMHSA's [bup locator](https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/find-treatment/treatment-practitioner-locator).  Some take insurance, some don't.

There are very few options for inpatient withdrawal management, unless you've got commercial insurance.  BreakThru in Hutch will take Medicaid too.  But SACK's detox downtown, and all the inpatient facilities like Options/WRC/PFH/Mirror, don't have any medical treatment for withdrawal.

If quitting cold turkey worked for most, I don't think we'd see 100k+ people dying of overdoses every year in the US.  In addition, Kansas has the 3rd highest % increase in overdose deaths in the last year ([here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm)).  All opioids are now a risk for fentanyl poisoning; cocaine and benzos are also regularly contaminated.  Waiting for someone to have success quitting on their own, at this point in the epidemic, is like waiting for the gun to run out of bullets.  Don't wait around.  If you're not sure where to go or what to do, it's never the wrong option to call SACK and ask them to do an eval.",t2_39v8nxba,pinguinno83,0,1647832574.0,0,t1_i1hk9qc,i1hk9qc,True,FinallyAtEase,t3_tieij5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/tieij5/mdonesub_clinic/,Mdone/sub clinic?,/r/wichita/comments/tieij5/mdonesub_clinic/i1hk9qc/,5,r/wichita,0,5

"That's sidetracking from the issue, also it's moronic to suggest that if you ride a plane you can fly one. I myself have had training as well as growing up around firearms. Ignorance breeds stupidity, I'd rather people know what they are doing. 

I can also turn your argument around and say people drive everywhere and there are definitely some that shouldn't. Vehicle accidents kill more and hurt more than firearms. Firearms are a decimal point compared to vehicle accidents. Yet we have young and old that shouldn't be on the road. 

I have no problem mandating firearm training for anyone that has a firearm. But that's a middle ground that few even want to consider instead they stick to their side of the argument, everyone can have one or no one can have one. 

That aside it's extremely hard to know when and when you can't use or brandish a firearm. It's a heat of the moment and when people feel threatened rational though goes out the window.

"Ahh. Well, I don't know the specific law on that. What I do, and what I think most people do, depends on the highway really? 

If it's something like Kellogg, a freeway with lots of area with no exits, I just move over to the middle or far right lane, maintaining my speed. If the emergency vehicle is moving over to exit, you just stay out of their way and move to the left if need be. 

If it's like a two lane highway with cross roads every block, I slow and move over, if the speed limit is like 50+ I will slow down but not necessarily stop because they will likely pass me before I slow to a stop. If it's like 40 then I'll come to a stop.

"The owner Alex Harb is a hot-headed garbage of a human. He does seriously shady business practices and treats his employees like complete garbage.

If you want long ass drawn out reasoning:

If you part ways with him whether it be by your own doing or his he'll talk shit about you behind your back. If you get let go from any of his businesses don't use them as a reference because he'll run you into the ground and make up lies. 

A girl that used to work for Computer Depot when he and the current owner were running it had to move out of the Wichita area because anytime they'd call him for a reference or to confirm employment he'd make up lies and do anything he could to convince them not to hire her. He did the same thing to me until I realized he was doing it and then I stopped including them on my resumes. 

When one of the employees from Ribbit left Alex called and harassed him for several days multiple times a day after thinking the ex-employee had bad mouthed him online and at one point left a voicemail snorting and saying ""You Americans are all pigs""

I made a comment on Meddy's reviews on Facebook a few months back agreeing with someone that he's garbage and Alex stalked my Facebook page, found out where my wife worked, called their corporate number to get ahold of her and then tried to act like he was the bigger person by saying ""I don't know what his problem is but if I did something to upset him I'd like for him to call me so we can work it out"" he thinks everyone is stupid and he's the only smart one but I know he did that because he knows I wont take his calls and that my wife might convince me to call him. 

Ask any of his ex employees that weren't 'close' to him or aren't Lebanese and they'll you he's a scumbag. Anytime he does charities like this they're nothing but a publicity stunt to make more profit by masking it with a good deed.  

Also Meddy's food is good for being fast food but it's far from the best in the city. If you want actual good Mediterranean food go down the street to N&Js. They're so much better and not owned by an American hating scumbag.


On the off chance Alex or any of his goons read this: If you think about calling me or my wife again, I want you to know I already contacted the local PD as well as the Wichita PD over your last stunt and my next step will be pressing harassment charges. Nothing I've said here is a lie or a fabrication and If you don't like what I'm saying about you, maybe you should treat your employees and ex-employees better and then they won't run off at the mouth about how you act like a child.",t2_7u7mcltz,DietSnapple9,0,1647724537.0,0,t1_i1bssrr,i1bssrr,False,Charles__Martel,t3_t7bm1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/t7bm1q/local_restaurant_chain_meddys_stepping_up_to_help/,Local restaurant chain (Meddys) stepping up to help people of Ukraine,/r/wichita/comments/t7bm1q/local_restaurant_chain_meddys_stepping_up_to_help/i1bssrr/,1,r/wichita,0,1
