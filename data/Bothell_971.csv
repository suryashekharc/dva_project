"Avalon and ava apartments are owned by the same Texas based company. I moved into an ava apartment when they first built it in the u-district. It had its problems, the adhesive they used on the linoleum faux wood floor was weak and the tiles rolled up near windows and heat vents. Also air is circulated throughout the whole building. If one person is smoking in one apartment everyone smells it in theirs within a minute. And every week someone would set off their cheap smoke alarms that a birthday candle would set off. Because the onsite management has no power they don't handle problems just complaining. This is likely true everywhere but the worst thing is after a few years they sold the building to people who manage the university housing and we lost most amenities including our rights to have a dog.

"Yup. Here’s a review I posted to the Bothell Eats FB page:

Another big thumbs up for Kro Bar. My wife and I met the in-laws there on Wednesday for drinks and food and everything was superb. No photos, but I will give special mention to the two cocktails I had, both from the Provisions list.

I had the Curtain Call first, not necessarily because it was at the top and I plan to drink my way through the entire menu (although yeah, that is the plan), but because of the unique ingredients: popcorn-washed bourbon, a house pineapple and agave syrup, and a biscotti (!!) liqueur (plus some bitters and lemon juice).

It was a well-balanced, fruity, bourbony drink of complex flavors that all blended together perfectly. I’ll be ordering this one again.

The second drink of the evening was the next one down the list, the Silent Cry. Another whiskey as the base, this time Suntory Toki, an easy-sipping Japanese whiskey that I’ve enjoyed neat, so was excited to see what they could do with it in a cocktail.

I liked this second cocktail even more than the first. Wow! Mixed with the whiskey was Douglas Fir liqueur (!!), a yuzu/beet infusion, Mandarin Napoleon, winter melon and angostura bitters, with a smoked rosemary garnish.

Oh. My. God. Less sweet than the first one, and more spirit-forward, the Silent Cry could be the best cocktail I have ever had. Each sips start with a nose of the smoky rosemary and is finished by a sublime blend of spirit, infusions, and bitters. A masterful combination of ingredients that together are far more than the parts alone.

We had food too, and it was equally amazing. My wife had the gnocchi, and it was one of those meals where every bite was perfection on the fork and you go back again and again just to have that one dish.

I ate too, but really, after sipping those cocktails, I could have been fed Cheez-Wiz on a Ritz and I’d still give this place five stars.",t2_3sedtqei,mike_owen,0,1648073137.0,0,t1_i1urea0,i1urea0,False,SixFootFiver,t3_tkdf1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/bothell/comments/tkdf1j/why_is_it_always_this_way/,Why is it always this way?,/r/bothell/comments/tkdf1j/why_is_it_always_this_way/i1urea0/,2,r/bothell,0,2

>""There’s a lot of history in Auburn — a lot of history in these homes. A lot of these homes are second generation and third generation owned, and losing that I think would be losing a part of Auburn’s history and something I think is really precious to us,” she adds.

I'd love to pick her brain about what kind of history those houses hold, and how that history is relevant to Auburn.  If there are specific sites that are of historical significance to the city, then perhaps the city should form a historical society to purchase and maintain those homes-- otherwise, they'll surely be heavily remodeled or worse by subsequent owners as the bones of the house continue to deteriorate.  

If it isn't the history in the physical buildings she's concerned about, she's effectively trying to stop her own town from being permitted to change with the times-- which will absolutely destroy those neighborhoods as people are forced to move away.

"Which assumption do you find to be more reasonable?
1. The airplanes that fly here and the engines in them will stay the same forever.
2. Things will change over time.

But also, what you just responded to *isn't* my argument; it's an example of another silly complaint.  The arguments (which you just skipped right over) are that a) your example of redeveloping a property is a poor one, b) precedent doesn't establish that something is *right*, and c) the *right* way to ensure residential neighborhoods aren't too noisy is to not allow neighborhoods to be plopped down right next to known noisy things.  

There are of course other things that can be done, like requiring noise abatement, usually in the form of green spaces, and it's worth noting that such abatement is almost universally the responsibility of the party doing the new development.  It is almost universally the case that preexisting uses for land take precedence.  Now, if the range wanted to *expand*, then the city or county could rightly take that opportunity to require them to take steps to mitigate the impact on surrounding properties, but it's not very common in my estimation for an existing property owner to be told that they suddenly have to do a bunch of extra stuff just to continue what they've been doing for a long time already.",t2_d3ljx,juiceboxzero,0,1642463821.0,0,t1_ht3vc9r,ht3vc9r,False,[deleted],t3_s5o7jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/bothell/comments/s5o7jt/kenmore_shooting_range_noise/,Kenmore shooting range noise,/r/bothell/comments/s5o7jt/kenmore_shooting_range_noise/ht3vc9r/,-1,r/bothell,0,-1

"Because people don't do things for ""no reason"" much less all the time for no reason and claiming that they do is turning a blind eye toward any potential inciting behaviors, given that it's happening to that person repeatedly. It's the same situation as ""if everyone you meet is an asshole, the asshole is you.""

I could say that YOU'RE saying that that there's no point in having a law because some people will break them anyway. I could say that you're saying that some people have to accept that others will put them at serious risk at high speed but that's just how it is. Is that what you're saying? No? Then don't put words in my mouth.

Brake-checking is a dangerous practice that can result in serious injury or death. Tailgating is a dangerous practice that can result in serious injury or death.

"Actually, I have a lot that is over .3 acre near downtown and many others exist that are limited to one home because of R8400 zoning.  This places my lot shy of division (yet the lot to the north is split twice, and a 5,000 sqft lot is under a block away). Then detached ADU's are limited by the size of the main home, which I'm under 1,000 sqft. The result is a HUGE lawn and difficulty in developing which would ideally create two new homes or more. Meanwhile, as you note developers are taking out old homes and doing 6-8 townhouses, which at the private owner level I've been told by the city I need multiple properties involved for consideration of rezoning to a smaller R5000 (my preferred city housing sizing) or R7200 with a 2+ year wait. All while the city refuses to resurface the road and repair drainage because they ""lack funding"" to support a 70+year-old neighborhood that paid taxes for decades. Clearly past administration was more willing for land use by private owners, the lack of this now, with the allowance for large developers and deterioration of city services to blocks boarding the downtown, makes such a bill of great value to the average citizen rather than wealthy investors. I'd love the freedom to put in two new 30' wide homes and see my fellow neighbors able to invest in developing rather than limited to what is city planned deterioration and cheap buy out.

"> So we shouldn't take threats seriously because kids can maybe be immature?

I don't know that this is an accurate take on it. Superintendent Reid seems fairly certain that it was a student that made the threat, otherwise it would have made no sense to call out ""the individual(s) who wrote the threatening message and those who may know who did it."" Given that, I can see the moral hazard in closing down the school; the message does, in effect, say: ""make a threat, get to stay home.""

Because it's not that ""kids can maybe be immature."" Adults do all sorts of stupid things for attention or a power trip all the time. I wouldn't have put it past people in my high-school class to pull something like this.

So while I understand the whole taking threats seriously angle, as written the message stops just short of calling this out as a hoax.",t2_9nmvk,Shield_Lyger,0,1638491055.0,0,t1_hn059f5,hn059f5,False,littleblackcar,t3_r78vhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/bothell/comments/r78vhz/in_light_of_the_recent_school_shooting_nsd_takes/,"In light of the recent school shooting, NSD takes action…",/r/bothell/comments/r78vhz/in_light_of_the_recent_school_shooting_nsd_takes/hn059f5/,1,r/bothell,0,1

"But that's the problem. You're focusing on what you don't like about what's currently there, rather than coming up with *a better plan for solving the problem at hand.* If the goal is for people to have resources for long-term care, what's the best way to go about it? Other insurance schemes don't allow people to treat their premium payments as personal savings accounts... why should this one?

I think the real problem here is that people aren't really invested in finding a solution to this problem. The state's benefit cap *is* really low. But what would premiums have to look like in order to guarantee every worker in the state a workable standard of care? And if people who don't use the system can withdraw their funds or have them left to survivors, what does that do to premiums? If the solution is for the state to force people to set aside enough to pay for their own care, yes, that would be a different law than the one that was passed. But I don't think people would go for that.

I think the problem with this law is that if has too many compromises for it to actually help the state manage its risk when there are substantial numbers of people turning to the state for care. I understand idea of not wanting another entitlement, since entitlements have to paid for.

"They have to publish their acceptance guideline and Washington is a First In Line State.  Which means the first applications that meet the published acceptance lines are the one that needs to be accepted.

With an FHA you need 3.5% down, so on a 500k house, 17.5k + whatever costs you agree to so closer to 25k. 

Also consider source of income is a protected class. So if you went to work and had Child Care Credits, that would be a source of income to count towards your 3x.  To me, as a landlord, 3x is non-negotiable. If you need to choose between food, cell phone and fixing the car so you can get to work, rent is going to be last. 98% of the time.

I understand that it doesn't make sense when it comes to childcare to have two low income working jobs, but if you can't pull the 3x income without going back to work, it seems you either need to find government programs to help you out, go back to work, or move to a cheaper location.

You make a good point about buying vs renting.  I guess I always assumed buying out here would require a down payment of at least 50k, when we don’t even have half that.

"It follows some pretty basic financial guidelines: 40% of your income goes to housing (rent/utilities/food) 30% for incidentals and living, and 30% savings.  If someone doesn't make 3x the monthly rent in income, they are one disaster away from being homeless. If you live well below your means and have savings then it's probably a better idea to buy a house than rent.

The other posters have slipped in with being able to get past these requirements in the past, but with the evolving landlord-tenant laws in Washington State it is becoming harder for a landlord to make ""judgement"" calls.  And they have to publish, and approve based on First Come First Serve basis, which drives up the requirements.

"> Some jurisdictions have adopted ordinances, effective after the statutory one-year waiting period, that authorize specific officials (such as the mayor, county executive, sheriff, or fire marshal) to prohibit fireworks during emergency conditions such as high fire danger.

Yes, the ordinance I cited was passed in 2016.  The RCW you cited does not say that ordinances can't have provisions that can be enacted with a waiting period of less than a year, just that new ordinances must have a waiting period.  It's a good thing Bothell had the foresight to pass the latest revision of this code 4 years ago then.  The code you cited also makes clear that *more restrictive* prohibitions are allowed.

> It is not clear whether local governments have the authority to impose an immediate fireworks ban during periods of high fire danger

Powers don't need to be explicitly granted by the state.  If the state doesn't say, chances are the local government can pass a law.  You saying it is ""not clear"" whether the code passed in 2016 can be used this way most likely means that it is.

You are of course -- personal responsibility being what it is, as someone who clearly understands the potential consequences and can roll the dice as they see fit -- more than welcome to gamble on your interpretation of these laws and hire a lawyer if you are fined and/or jailed.

"Emergency Fireworks Bans

It is not clear whether local governments have the authority to impose an immediate fireworks ban during periods of high fire danger.
Some jurisdictions have adopted ordinances, effective after the statutory one-year waiting period, that authorize specific officials (such as the mayor, county executive, sheriff, or fire marshal) to prohibit fireworks during emergency conditions such as high fire danger. In addition, it can be argued that [RCW 70.77.250](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.77.250)(4) does not impact the ability of local governments to adopt emergency restrictions or bans in response to extreme heat, drought, or other circumstances that would make the discharge of fireworks unreasonably dangerous.
There is no clear law either way on this question, so local governments will need to evaluate the possible legal risks of enacting an emergency measure that restricts or bans the discharge of fireworks.

From BMC 8.37.215, passed in 2016:

> Upon recommendation of the city manager, the city council may issue a city-wide temporary order prohibiting the sale, possession and use of consumer fireworks. Said recommendation shall be based on a reasonable and articulable belief that hazardous conditions exist where the sale and use of consumer fireworks poses a severe wildland-urban interface fire hazard, increasing risk and/or threatening public safety. Prior to making the recommendation, the city manager shall consult the fire chief and police chief for best available public safety information pertinent to the conditions. Said information shall be communicated to the council as part of the city manager’s recommendation. The temporary emergency order shall specify the time period it shall be in effect. The emergency order may be cancelled by the city council prior to its expiration date, based on recommendation from the city manager after consultation with the fire chief and police chief as to prevailing conditions. (Ord. 2190 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).

"Did you witness this happening first hand? I'm asking because it was curious of the suspects attire? Do you know if they were in regular day clothes or if they were wearing cycling gear/ helmet. You know, what i mean, bright colored spandex and helmet etc. I had a similar occurrence maybe three nights ago on the burke Gilman near blythe park. Although I am a male I had a man and woman from about a hundred feet away yell aggressively to clear the path for their riding and they passed me unnecessarily close as I was favoring the very corner of my side of the path and right as they passed me they veered towards a woman with a small dog on a short leash shouting. I ride bikes on this trail for years and would commute via bicycle several years back along the trail 10 miles a day for several years. Never seen anyone or any two people do anything so intentionally irrationally aggressive while shouting for their right to pass. I don't know seems strange but it was as far as I know an isolated incident. Although this now that I read from you it is strangely similar.

"> Hood relayed to the other officers at the scene that Churna may be having mental health issues.

You think?

This reminds me of the Daniel Shaver case from a few years back in Arizona. Police officers demanding perfect compliance from a person, who, in hindsight is pretty clearly impaired, and then shooting when they don't get it.

In any event, this strikes me as being less about police misconduct than officers having unrealistic expectations of how compliant people are going to be (and for how long) in certain situations.

"I am off of 180th as well, and sounds like the same neighborhood as you prach360. We really enjoy it here. It is  safe area and growing. We have several road projects underway or soon to be to help alleviate the traffic problems. We find it convenient to many things, shopping, grocery, restaurants.

"The city cops are dicks, but that’s pretty much the standard anywhere you go.... I have had much more favorable interactions with the county sherrif’s department, without a doubt.   What I find weird is that the city is split between 2 counties, which can be confusing in certain situations.
Please, please, PLEASE try to keep in mind that the speed limit on Bothell-Everett Highway is 45.  Don’t be like every other clown in town who goes 10 under for no god damn reason.

Pre-Covid, you could find something interesting to go check out pretty much every night of the week, Sundays included.

Wine enthusiasts tend to dig being so close to Woodinville (wine country), which is just a few minutes drive from DT Bothell.  Chateau Ste Michelle typically has a kickass summer concert series, well worth checking out at least one show, if you have the time.

We are close enough to the city and if you time the traffic right it’s only a half hour commute ( I work in Seattle), but it can also be a nightmare in bad weather or if there’s an accident.

"I find it very easy to get to Downtown from Bothell. I moved here a little over 10 years ago and have had quite the journey but I began in Kirkland (next to Bothell), spent a year living on Capitol Hill after that, I lived in Woodinville, Lynnwood, dated someone in Tacoma and now live in Renton. I JUST signed a lease to move to Bothell next month. Seattle has changed in the decade I have lived here, but in all my years here I have found the Eastside of Bothell, Kirkland, Mill Creek, Woodinville, Redmond and Bellevue are some of the nicest areas. Mukilteo can be nice even further east aswell as Edmonds on the water front. People are moving out of the downtown area right now because of what happened during the pandemic/CHOP/racial prostest/riots what have you. We have a large homeless population, and not everyone is a drug user but we have a large population that does use and they half infiltrated the city, much of the south side suburbs are getting worse like Renton, Auburn, Tukwila etc. I was robbed in White Center at gunpoint and generally have a distaste in my mouth anywhere much further south. It begins to feel as if you're losing the ""Seattle"" vibe, the further you drive out towards Tacoma (which is ghetto in and of itself). Other places further east of Bothell that I personally stay away from that reflect the same issues I listed above are parts of Lynnwood, and most definitely Everett. I am ecstatic about moving back to the east side where it's safe, quaint,  busses are reachable everywhere, there are local farmers markets, good school systems, there is upkeep on litter, maintenance on lawn care and other such things. I have been downtown in as little as 30 min from the busline. It is also a 10 min drive to Lake Forest Park and Juanita Beach. Fantastic place to hang out on a day off.

"So, how is my response ""gross""?  It may come from a different perspective, but I disagree that it is ""gross"" or ill-intentioned.  

Also, again - if someone is a freaking creep - they're going to be a creep whether or not you acknowledge them (they will probably just pester you until you do respond if they are ill-intentioned).  No one is saying you have to strike up a convo, but if someone smiles politely and nods at you as you pass by to acknowledge that you are a fellow human, its generally accepted in 99% of the rest of the country that you acknowledge this as a polite gesture.  No, women dont have to ""smile"" at creepy men, but sometimes its nice to acknowledge that people other than yourself exist (and lets be clear - we arent just talking about men hitting on women here - im talking about EVERYONE).

Theres a reason why so many people from other areas of the country dislike the people living in Seattle.  Its the complete disregard for social niceties or general politeness that people here seem to have.

"It must be a cultural thing. I've lived in the PNW all my life, in small towns and in cities. In small towns (10,000 or less) probably 80% of people will make eye contact and say hello as you cross paths, because there aren't that many people, so on a walk you might pass 5 people en route to your destination. Also a very big chance that person is your dentist, or your kid's teacher, or your friend's mom.

Different in a bigger town. If you said hello to everyone you passed, that's all you'd be doing. And they're more likely to be a stranger, so saying hello doesn't achieve anything.

I've never not once been offended if I looked up looking to make eye contact and the other person didn't return it. Perhaps they're calculating some mental math, or going over a conversation they just had or are preparing to have, or maybe they're just daydreaming (important downtime to allow the brain to process the day's events). 

Manners are subjective. What is a simple polite gesture to you is an invasion of time to another. If you're offended because someone didn't give you a fleeting glimpse of attention,  you might want to reevaluate what is truly important to you and perhaps find a culture that lines up with your ideals better.",t2_784yw,KitsBeach,0,1615758941.0,0,t1_gqy72cq,gqy72cq,False,somosextremos82,t3_m4q32g,https://www.reddit.com/r/bothell/comments/m4q32g/when_out_for_a_walk_and_i_pass_by_you_and_say_hi/,"When out for a walk and I pass by you and say hi, why don't you say hi in return?",/r/bothell/comments/m4q32g/when_out_for_a_walk_and_i_pass_by_you_and_say_hi/gqy72cq/,3,r/bothell,0,3

Then you have things like the head of the teachers union in Berkley arguing that schools should be shut down, but then he is caught on video dropping his kid off at a private school.

"I thought it would be a good idea, but reality is, these investors are not buying cheap SFH that everyday folks could afford. And the bidding wars are against other investors or tech millionaires. Any tax might increase state income, but won’t lower the housing cost. The only ways I could think of is to increase the urban concentration by building up or allow more sprawling and build out transportation infrastructure to reach these futures suburbs BEFORE they are built to minimize cost. Not great for the environment, but people need places to live. In a way, light rail connecting Seattle and Tacoma will accomplish that.

"Or... I don't know, fix the Growth Management Act and allow for more homebuilding? It's a fool's errand to take a place with legally restricted housing supply and attempt to keep prices down by controlling who can buy and for what reason. If one wants housing to be cheap, there has to be a lot of it, and it has to be readily available. The Growth Management Act is one of the regulations that prevented that from happening when things here really began to take off.

The UW did a paper on it back in 2006 or so. It made a splash at the time, then the Great Recession happened (but note that housing prices here didn't fall as much as they did elsewhere) and it was kind of forgotten about. It's easy to blame foreign investors or tech companies for housing woes, but the problem at the bottom of it all is that the supply doesn't keep up with the demand. And note that this also benefits a lot of people. I know two single parents who put their kids through college using the massive boost to their home equity that the housing crunch generated.",t2_9nmvk,Shield_Lyger,1,1613840787.0,0,t1_go4voge,go4voge,True,Some-Leather-792,t3_lo6o5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/bothell/comments/lo6o5g/is_it_time_to_tax_foreign_real_estate_investors/,"Is it time to tax Foreign Real Estate Investors in Seattle, King and Snohomish?
