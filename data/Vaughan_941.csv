"The location in the Esso at Major Mac and Jane threatened to call the police on my mother because she asked for napkins.

Not a big deal right? Well when we got her order, they once again gave her no napkins. She asked for some at the window (like she usually had to do) and now was a little upset that she even had to ask. The woman attending to us looked at us like we just asked her for 6 Big Mac’s and came back with one single napkin. My mother asked for some more and I stg this woman blew up on us. She said something along the lines of “You can’t have all the napkins! If u want more u need to buy more coffee to get more napkins”. A NAPKIN. Any restaurant will willing give u their entire stash even if u don’t spend a dime there. So yeah, my mother said she won’t leave until they give her more than 1 napkin and the drive-thru lady threatened to call the police.

"Based on visiting friends / family’s places and interactions with them over the last 10+ years, below is based on my experiences and experiences of friends: 

8201 Islington Ave. (Condos) - this was years ago but Rogers service (pretty sure Rogers not bell) was a dead spot on the cell and internet Wasn’t reliable. Hopefully it got better as there is a great BBQ place just down the street. 

250 Pine Grove Road (just up the street from the mentioned above). Good friend lived there for years and moved out to upsize. He made a lot of friends in the building and really liked it. Out of numerous gatherings over the years no neighbours ever complained nor did we ever really hear anyone else. 

Woodbridge Avenue area. A friend lived in a condo and another rented a room on a side street. They both really enjoyed the walk ability of Woodbridge Ave / market lane. 

Bellaria Towers (Jane & Rutherford) - I know a lot of people who moved there when it was first built and some after. I visit people there a lot. Besides trying to find parking during holidays and most likely still requiring access to a car it’s always been very clean and quiet with a bunch of amenities. 

As mentioned by another user - I haven’t heard good things about transit city and you’ll be living in construction for years to come. That strip of hwy 7 from Jane to the hwy is also a nightmare if you have to drive. What it does have going for it through is the subway and viva dedicated lines. YMCA and a public library in one of the towers and events being planned and run in the area. The future will have more parks, walk ability and other things….

"You seem to lack a basic understanding of statistics. Although I don’t think you will be capable of understanding, I’ll state the true facts anyway, in case I’m wrong about that:

-	From your link, about 65% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 are vaccinated. 
-	About 85% of all of Ontario are fully vaccinated. 
-	That means that for any group of a significant enough sample size, let’s say 862 which represents the total hospitalized in Ontario from COVID (also from your link),  we expect the same proportion of vaccinated people. I.e., we expect 732 people hospitalized out of the 862 (85%)
-	However, only 553 of those hospitalized are fully vaccinated. 
-	Therefore, the difference is statistically significant (65% vs 85%), with fewer than expected being fully vaccinated (in your claim that there isn’t a difference).

"Maybe bring extra masks with you and hand them out if youre in a closed off space. Let them know you have an immuno compromised child, and say youd appreciate if they put on a mask. And offer up a mask. If theyre completely dissociated psychopaths, they wont put on a free mask for a few minutes. Absolute whining babies these people are. Wear a fucking mask you mouth breathers. I dont think you can tell them what to do, but you might be able to harness some reasoning by milking what little emotion they have left. This virus will eventually evolve to be way less harmful. The question is when do the experts think that is? Its looking better with omicron and well leave it at that.

If they say its my freedom to not wear a mask, you say its my freedom to safety. One is a privileged right, the other is a human right. Big difference. You can look at masks as a political tool, or you can look at wearing masks as something to catch the germs in the water dropets you breathe out. Just wear one, and if you cant breathe take it off for a few seconds, and put it back on.

Also dont use cheap masks for yourself. Get kn95 rated from like hardware stores. Those filter what your breathe in.

Check your speed, If that's within 90% of your broadband speed plan.  Then just invest in a router.

"Can confirm this is not a scam and a great option for those without dental coverage. Just a heads up, a full cleaning takes about 8 hours spread over 2 days for a procedure that takes 30 mins normally. BUT going here really helps the students out as the school is a huge money grab and doesn't care at all about the success of their students, so going as a patient is a huge help to the students who pretty much fail because they can't get enough patients over the course. 

About 6.5 hours is spent waiting in the chair for an instructor to come check their work. The system is like this because the instructor to student ratio is Wayyy beyond the normal span of control to maximize profits for the owner who parks his Bently right out front so everyone knows where the money goes. 

When the patients walk out, the student fail, have to pay for more lab time, thus increasing the owner to Bently ratio. Ie.

"My brother works at Walmart so I asked him the same thing. He said technically they are not supposed to enter, but getting them to leave is too much of a hassle.

They have masks at the front of the store so they try and offer them to these maskless shoppers whenever they come. The store manager told me too that sometimes he will go and tell these people to wear a mask and they will still try and fight him even though it’s his store lol.

"I’ve been through that area quite a bit, and am familiar with many of the trails.

You’ll probably be fine on the main trail, there’s frankly not much that can go wrong walking it. But off in some of the forests or deep brush you may run into the usual wildlife such as coyotes, etc, so beware. There are also deer in the area (I’ve seen them in the forests and valleys on both sides of Pine Valley north of Rutherford) but they’ll usually run if they see you.

Some of the trails off the main William Granger run along cliff sides and drop-offs, so I’d avoid those ones. Obstacles like those may be visible during the day, but can be easily missed at night. Also, some can get rather muddy and slippery depending on the time of year. There was one side trail I took that was a combination of mud and wet pine needles, and that was no fun.

This time of the year is a no-go, but for the summer, maybe if everything is dry, and you’re familiar with the trails you’ll be taking at night. But just random trail exploration in the dark is a good way to fall off a cliff (that may seem like an exaggeration, but there are some side trails there where one wrong step could be very dangerous).",t2_3pcowu34,CyrilSneerLoggingDiv,0,1639638209.0,0,t1_hor483w,hor483w,True,Then_Eye8040,t3_rhjqrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaughan/comments/rhjqrz/hiking_at_night_a_challenge_worth_1000/,Hiking at night?

"They already did the Vellore Village area, they were all over and it took a month or three. I was in Sonoma Heights area (Islington/ Rutherford) the other day and saw the locating company doing the markings and Bell’s contractor Sentrex SCI and working on one street, so they’re working there now.

Here’s what to expect: they usually do a few streets in an area at a time. A street usually takes a week or so to do. They run all the fibre optic cables underground using the underground side-boring machines, and use the hydro vac trucks to do some suction in some areas (to avoid hitting underground lines).

It’s usually a pretty unobtrusive process unless you’re at a major junction point or corner where they need to run the machine from. In the end you will end up with a small dug up square on your lawn with some dirt on it. What they do is if you want Bell to your house (they’ll walk around and ask when most of the work is done), a crew will hand-dig a shallow trench from the square to your house and bury the line, and install a small permanent green junction box into your lawn. If you don’t opt for Bell, they’ll just restore your lawn by putting a matching square of grass over the cutout and you’ll never know it was there (they can dig it up and patch into the line if you decide to switch later).

"Still hurts to think about this incident. I’ve been to that neighbourhood a couple of times before and have gone on that exact part of Athabasca Drive.

And that’s not even taking into account that it was summer time and everyone is outside and about.
