"Comparatively, winters aren't as bad as they used to be.

As for liberals moving to our state, guns are sometimes a hotbed issue.

As for food, I've had better Mexican food from a deli in a grocery store in Illinois than I've had from any restaurant around here. Not to mention having a variety of GOOD AUTHENTIC CUISINE.

Housing is becoming an issue because of the swell in population, what you're viewing at 4-500k used to be half as much. As for renters, a single room apartment is going to cost at least 700 a month (if you're lucky).

Generally, us montanans want to preserve the ways we grew up with, and an influx of people from out of state (who have different views from our majority) aren't usually greeted with open arms.

"Moved here from Chicago in June. My original motive kinda went up in smoke so I'm going to Carroll College over here and working at a pharmacy. It's a culture shock most definitely from my roots in the city, but in a great way.  


People I've met are pretty friendly with each other, the downtown area is pretty clean (in comparison to Chicago you guys are spotless lmao), the local stores are inviting, and Florence is probably the best coffee I've ever had. There's 2 things I'd mention though:

  
Come 8pm alot of things are just closed. That was a shock my first month, when at 11pm I wanted McDonald's only to realize it was closed.  


The second thing, which is kinda funny, is the lines at fast food places are unlike anything I've ever seen at certain times.  Not entirely sure why, but I've had it where I was kicked out of a Taco Bell line i was waiting in for 20 minutes because it was just so long. I found it more hilarious than actually upsetting, but keep that in mind when getting food.  


Other than that, I'd say I personally made the right decision coming here. If you like smaller towns with a fantastic view, ample outdoors to explore, and a more laid back lifestyle, I'd say it's a good bet you'll enjoy this town.",t2_57wwtwat,burnerbot_,1,1645742244.0,0,t1_hyayehr,hyayehr,True,Nursesds1,t3_t078ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/helena/comments/t078ua/what_do_you_love_about_living_in_helena_we_are/,What do you love about living in Helena?

"My wife and I love it here, but by most of the people who know us we are boring people. In high school I never went to parties, and my wife thought the most fun things to do when she was in High School was to paint the walls of her room. We go out by ourselves to dinner once a year and are very happy this way. Helena is perfect for us and it feels faster than the lives we lead. 

I fish and hunt as much as I can, and those are the most exhilarating aspects of my life. 

Helena is a beautiful town with wonderful people, but it feels like a community of people like us. 

I just got back from a work trip in NYC and I stayed inside my hotel room the entire week. I just find going to bar after bar or five different restaurants insanely boring. I’d rather hike to a river and fish for the entire day.

"I was born and raised in Montana. 
Me and everyone I grew up with will never be able to afford homes here, can barely find/afford apartments, often can't go camping, swimming, hunting, fishing, hiking or out to our favorite places because they are packed. Many of our outdoor spaces and local businesses, fields and secret spots have been bought, fenced off and developed by wealthy transplants. Beautiful areas are being plowed and replaced by condos, mansions and gravel pits. Hell, I haven't even been able to rent a forest service cabin for over a year. Prices have gone up everywhere.
Tens of thousands of people moved here to flee from the pandemic. Most of us work service jobs (at least in my circle) and the majority of those who moved to flee, did so to actively avoid quarantining and wearing masks. Many of them are rude, particularly to service people and blue collar workers/farmers. Our large native population and reservations are little known and often disrespected. Native cave paintings around our lake have been vandalized and permanently ruined.
I have almost been run over dozens of times over the last two years and have nearly been hit by drivers, all with out of state plates.
Crime is at an all time high, break-ins and murders used to be unheard of. Butte is now one of the most crime-ridden towns per Capita in the nation. Addiction and homelessness is pouring out onto the streets for the first time now. I never thought I would see any of this.
Living in Montana used to be boring and no one cared about the place, but we had freedom and nature, we could afford it and we were proud of our state. 
Now, it breaks my heart to see that it's being turned into all the other overdeveloped and overpopulated states and that I will probably have to leave someday. It is truly the last best place and won't be for long.
I don't agree with harassing someone with notes on their car and at least appreciate having more diversity. but I wish so many people would stop moving here. If you do, just understand the local culture a bit. Be kind, courteous, humble, drive slowly and observe pedestrians, respect natives and blue collars, don't spread covid and don't ruin the beauty. Give the locals first dibs.

"I've lived here my whole life. Montana looks nice from a distance. Over the last 40 years, that distance has grown. The closer you get, the worse it looks. People seem nice overall but watch out if you're not in a larger town and you're 'not like the others.' 

Social media does let you see the worst we have to offer, I'll say that. 

You can find pockets of good people here. We're around. We're just outnumbered by the Trump supporting, confederate-flag waving red voters in the rural areas and northeastern Montana. The people that would put folks like us up against a wall to be shot with no regrets.

It's become way too expensive to live here. Pay is rising at lower end jobs, so there is that. But rent and house prices are just stupid.

"Hi there. I grew up in Helena and my folks still live there so I head back fairly often. When I was a kid, I couldn’t wait to leave and see more or the world, but now that I’ve been fortunate enough to travel and live elsewhere I’ve grown a new fondness for the place. 

It’s quiet, artsy, and has some of the best public trails you’ll find anywhere. The local brewery scene is growing and can be a good place to catch some live music or hop in on a pub trivia game. It’s definitely becoming a cooler place than when I was a kid. 

As for the sentiment towards “outsiders” I think locals (myself included) are all just wary of Montana becoming more and more like Colorado. It’s been called “The Last Best Place” for a long time, and it seems like more people are discovering that, especially over the last couple years. 

As for the “no refugees” thing, I personally know folks who have helped displaced refugees from Cuba and elsewhere find new homes and livelihoods in Helena. Politically Montana is purple. That never seemed to matter much when it came down to finding common ground as citizens with a passion for the wild places, outdoor jobs, hunting, fishing, etc., but like the rest of our country the differences have been intensified over the last couple years.

In my experience, when it comes down to it, it doesn’t matter which way you lean politically or what religion you believe in, people around here care about the quality of your character.

"We did a construction to mortgage with this bank and loan officer in the last 16 months.  He was responsive, answered our many questions, always picked up the phone or emailed and really worked to get us the best rate and there were no unforeseen snags in the process.  We wanted to go with a local\\regional bank not a national.  I am sure you know that you should meet with the bank when you start working with your agent.   I hope you find a nice place.  Since it is your first one just look at the potential for you or the next buyer if you ever decide to sell.

"It's a tough market but people are buying houses every day. Stick with it and you'll find what you need. All the Realtors mentioned here have great reputations.

We always recommend local banks. They know the realtors and have a little bit of wiggle room the national banks don't have. I recommend Valley Bank they are friendly, knowledgeable, and give back to the community.

"Even if your incorrect use of language was acceptable, you'd still be wrong on half of your point. Surgical masks are still recommended and in use, and nothing was banned. They're free to use cloth masks as long as they're paired with a more effective tool as well, and even that is largely because of very stupid people trying to game the system with obviously ineffective alternatives.

It's ignorant because it has nothing to do with science at all and reflects a very transparent lack of interest in learning about the thing you feel the need to run your mouth about. If you don't care about the reality of the situation as much as you care about your feelings, that's fine.

"Well, it's based on proximity and length of exposure. The kids (at least at our school) are monitored pretty closely so contact tracing is easier. You only get a call if they've been within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes, because viral load is somewhat dose dependant - meaning that whether you get sick depends not just on exposure, but on how much and long you were exposed.

They sit by the same kids in the classroom and the same kids in the lunchroom, and are supposed to social distance anytime in between. So theoretically, the only kids who need a call are those within 6 feet at those times.

It's imperfect for sure, but it's better than nothing and also better than putting entire classrooms in quarantine for every positive.

"Actually I've got a second now.

- You DEFINITELY don't understand copyright infringement, or even copyright at all. Social media posts are only protectable by copyright when the work being posted is in a protected format, which online comments and similar rarely are, and copyright infringement only applies to applicable works which have already been copyrighted, which isn't automatically done every time you type words. You have to actually apply, and pay a fee, and wait for approval - assuming the work qualifies for copyright. Which your comment almost certainly did not. You might know these things had you graduated, but alas. That pesky expulsion.

- ""I just deleted my comments to shut you up,"" and, ""I am going to keep talking at you forever and ever and YOU have to stop talking first,"" are contradictory statements, Skylar. If you didn't want to engage with me, you wouldn't continue giving me things to reply to. I'm always going to reply, and I'm not interested in what your angry family friends are feeling about the issue. Legality doesn't end when sensitive boys and their mom's friends get mad. Don't be creepy and you won't attract the attention of people whose attention you don't want.

- Lol don't try your ""I'm autistic feel sorry for me"" nonsense here, buddy. I'm also on the spectrum, and I've managed to not be a complete asshole OR give advice for avoiding detection to pedophiles even one time in my entire life. If you don't want to lose business over your showing of your ass online, don't show your ass online. It's really that simple. Nobody has created a monster for you to fight, you are the monster. Behave better.

- I absolutely did not encourage people to harm you, what the fuck? Lol that's absolutely fiction. I told people to use their best judgement in their interactions with you, if that feels like a recommendation of harm, perhaps consider behavior that makes people feel less like it's against their best interest to interact with you. Also, I didn't write ""pages and pages"" across ""multiple"" platforms you dramatic little caboose. I responded to your comments here, and I posted very little about you on NextDoor. Stop exaggerating, it weakens your points.

"First of all, I never said you are ""probably"" a pedophile, only that in my opinion you exhibited exceedingly poor judgement to a degree that I believe you could possibly be a danger to the community, which I do.

Second, I did consider that and decided that the audience on NextDoor is small enough that the benefits of warning the mostly parents and grandparents who hang out there regularly outweighed the risks. My concern for this type of post on Reddit specifically is much greater because Reddit is notorious for being a gathering place for unsavory people with unsavory ideas.

I looked over your previous posts and concluded that your obsession with the sexuality of others combined with your comments here added up to a red flag that makes me nervous about the idea of giving you access to my or anyone in my community's digital information. Your doubling down when the risk was pointed out makes me more confident in that discomfort.

I posted what you said and encouraged others to use their best judgement based on your words. I accused you of nothing and commented only on my interpretation and concern.

"It literally (not figuratively) says something along those lines for liability purposes in the same way they warn you to wait 30 seconds after you heat a can of soup. In the off chance a mask doesn't work, one sentence protects whoever produces the masks.

""David Mulligan, MD, chief of transplant surgery and immunology, knows the importance of masks even beyond the operating room. 'When we make rounds, for example, on significantly immuno-compromised patients, we will have a mask on to try to help protect those patients from the spread of disease and to try to protect other patients from bringing potential pathogens like bacteria and viruses from one room to the next,' he says""

""If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others."" 

I mean, if they don't want blood in their mouths, the mask probably prevents droplets from spreading to patients. 

I'd also like to add I had to wear a mask on top of ear and eye protection in a hot and humid workshop for 8 hours a day when I was 15. I didn't bitch or complain as much as certain adults do when they have to grocery shop with a mask on for 10 mins.

"I do all of these things. She has the pretty, comfortable and expensive masks with Elsa, Anna, Ariel and Minnie Mouse. Kids are not stupid, even a 6 year old can make logical observations about their surroundings. She has told me how she thinks it’s unfair how her teacher doesn’t have to wear he mask while she stands up in front of the class while she teaches. It’s hard not to agree with her. No matter what wearing a mask for 7 hours a day is hard on anyone especially a little. I do not indulge her complaints and I don’t tell her I agree with her but in the back of my mind my distain for the Helena school district grows every time I get a condescending email from the Superintendent. It’s causing her to dislike aspects of school. She is upset that they her parents can’t come watch her Christmas performance in person. They have to watch over a video conference. Anyone to try and convince me that we shouldn’t be allowed to watch in person is not looking at the big picture and seeing every other sporting event the school district allows parents and community members to attend. Life isn’t fair and my daughter is well aware of this. Finally, I would disagree saying it’s necessary for a 6 year old to have to wear a mask.

"Ya gotta make it fun for kids. It's like brushing their teeth, or going on a long car ride, or getting a shot. Discomfort is part of life, as parents we should be teaching them that, and that though sometimes discomfort is a necessity, it won't last forever. Parents should be teaching their children coping mechanisms rather than indulging pointless frustrations, like being concerned about ""fairness"". Life isn't fair. It's lame, ya covid sucks, but that's life. I don't know how to tell you that lifes frustrations dont really get any better either. The source of your frustration changes, ebbs and flows, but never disappears completely, and never will.  So, you should probably learn to make the best of it. Nature doesn't care a bit for your discomfort, but it will take advantage of it whenever possible. 

You can try looking for more comfortable masks, and masks that are stylish or exciting for your little. Let her know that in other parts of the world girls wear them for fashion statements (and to avoid pollution/germs). How ninjas wore them. Tell her how wearing them helps everyone.  If all she hears about masking is negativity, that's what she'll parrot. Kids that age aren't typically the most nuanced thinkers.

"So... I have a vague theory on this, and it's not that Helena has more banks than other places, (thought it might have a little more because of the reserve bank and the town acting like a ""central"" town for commerce from the surrounding areas)  it's just that we see the banks more.

Helena, compared to a lot of towns, has a really interesting intermix of commercial and residential.  So we have a ""downtown"" area, then we have the ""Walmart"" area, then we have Custer/Target area, as well as the kind of interconnected area over by the airport, as well as all of Montana Ave, the area around the old Mall (Prospect/11th), plus Euclid, plus the little area by Capitol high school.

In a lot of other town, there will be main artery streets that just go to and are bordered by residential areas, but in Helena, it's like every Artery street is it's own commercial district.  So instead of all the banks being clustered in two or three areas, they're spread out all over town.  And then all of the north valley is mostly residential, so all the banks for everyone out there are located in the town proper.  So it ends up seeming like a lot for the number of people in town, but is not for the number of people who are actually being serviced by all of them.

That's my theory.  I'd be happily proven wrong by some type of ""banks per population"" data, if someone can find that!",t2_cldl3plj,OrindaSarnia,0,1637287985.0,0,t1_hl7af4f,hl7af4f,True,Quick_Bench_8702,t3_qwd4q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/helena/comments/qwd4q3/helena_banking/,Helena Banking,/r/helena/comments/qwd4q3/helena_banking/hl7af4f/,2,r/helena,0,2

"I grew up in a city of half a million people, and in high school all I wanted was to live in a BIGGER CITY, because I saw my town as being podunk and unappealing.  Really there was a lot there that I just couldn't tap into because I was young.  I moved away to go to college, and then lived in a bunch of different places before finally ending up in Helena for various reasons.

Some places definitely have different feelings from other places, but I also think there's a general ""fear of missing out"" feeling that makes big cities seem so appealing when we're young, regardless of where we live. (There is always somewhere bigger, or more exciting for some other reason).

Obviously lots of people will make cities their home for their adult lives, and I hope you get a chance to experience other places before you decide where you'll settle down (you've got lots of time), but I also think as we get older we figure out what we really care about and what we only thought we cared about because society told us we should, and that helps temper that feeling that there's always something bigger and better out there that we have to go find.

"So most newspapers will not print stories about suicides, unless in this case, they will because several schools went into lockdown because of it, and it appears they reported the ""active shooter"" event before they knew it was a suicide, and then reported the suicide because they needed to clarify and close their previous report. (They included a special note about why they ran this story).

It's understood now that people who are suicidal already are very susceptible to news about others committing suicide.  It can act like encouragement to those who are vulnerable.  So it's considered to be in the best interest of public health to not do news stories on these incidents.  Obviously obituaries will occasionally mention the cause of death if the family chooses to include that.  But otherwise, no stories from the news team. 

(There's actually some discussion currently around how much media portrayals of school shootings do or do not perpetual more of them (as they are often part of a suicide), but they end up being so newsworthy that it's hard to justify not talking about them at all.)

There was actually a series of suicides amongst high schools in the Flathead Valley recently and it didn't make the news until there were several and the newspapers there decided to run stories that didn't mention names, dates or how it happened, but did run stories about what mental health resources were in the area, what special events different agencies were holding to support people, etc.",t2_cldl3plj,OrindaSarnia,0,1637010488.0,0,t1_hkro2lc,hkro2lc,False,BonnieJeanneTonks,t3_qsnbv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/helena/comments/qsnbv7/one_juvenile_dead_near_capital_high_school/,One juvenile dead near Capital High School,/r/helena/comments/qsnbv7/one_juvenile_dead_near_capital_high_school/hkro2lc/,3,r/helena,0,3

"Missoula is a college town, plain and simple.  So it's going to have everything a college town usually does, like more restaurants (more bars), expensive housing, a wickedly over-qualified pool of employees, community events, concerts, etc.  Not just things students would want, but also all the things professors want (so higher end options too).

Helena is a government town.  We certainly have plenty of liberal folks, but we also have conservative folks, because that's what you get in a state like Montana.  The City Council currently has 2 liberal members, 2 conservative members and a liberal major making the time breaking votes, so it's not just conservatives here.  I've lived in Missoula, the Flathead, and Helena, and Helena has the worst restaurant options, by far.

Also - while Helena has a city pop of 30,000 and Kalispell has a city pop of I think 20,000...  if you look at the whole Helena Valley I think you get around 50,000 or a bit more, if you count Kalispell, Whitefish, Columbia Falls, Lakeside, Bigfork, and all the valley around them you get almost 100,000...  plus the demand of tourists, you have a lot better food, shopping, etc in the Flathead.  Plus the draw of Glacier NP means lots of scientists, artists, and other generally liberal, young, interesting people...  it's getting a bad rap right now because of Richard Spencer and that crazy anti-vaxxer who was on the health dept's commitee for awhile, but when you actually live there, you don't feel that as an everyday part of your life (at least it wasn't in your face, pre-pandemic)  I know housing prices are crazy there too, but if you're looking at Missoula, I would look at the Flathead Valley as well.  They also have Michael Goguen's various enterprises that might be relevant for job hunting as a software engineer...

Edit: just read the comments that you lived in Kalispell at some point.  We moved to Helena 4.5 years ago, and lived in the Flathead for 7 years before that, not sure when you were there.",t2_cldl3plj,OrindaSarnia,0,1636750434.0,0,t1_hkdmmdq,hkdmmdq,False,Putnam14,t3_qruuq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/helena/comments/qruuq9/helena_vs_missoula_for_couple_in_mid20s/,Helena vs Missoula for couple in mid-20s,/r/helena/comments/qruuq9/helena_vs_missoula_for_couple_in_mid20s/hkdmmdq/,5,r/helena,0,5

Missoula is a better ski city.  That being said Helena is perfectly in the middle of several snowpacks and can reliably get to good storms when Missoula or Bozeman flops in about 2 hours.  Helena lacks a bit in the restaurants department but otherwise it is cheaper and everyone is friendly.  Less busy and quiet.  We like those things where that might be a turn off to others.  My guess is biking is better in Helena.  Both places seem cliquey.

"Helena here and we moved our family (wife 2 teenage kids) to Helena 2 years ago this summer from...Boise (residents for 20 years) for the exact reason.  We lived in the North End and when our rent went to $1800 and the house next door sold for $600,000 we decided to take off.

We live about 4 blocks from Downtown in a big old house that would be like living in the North End...kinda sketchy in areas but overall nice.  There are trails everywhere and mtn biking and hiking are big.  There is a ski resort relatively close and the Missouri River is an hour away with world class fishing and floating.  Long story short its beautiful...

The cons...its getting expensive, we cannot find a house in the area we want to live for under $300,000.  No restaurants really...we used to love to eat out all the time but now we drive to Missoula (1hr 45min)  or Bozeman (1hr 30min) for food or shopping of anything that isnt from Target or WalMart.

"On page 14 & 15 this document shows water and sewer rates for the 50 biggest cities in the US, the example is a bill that would be 10 units, if your $80 bill is 8 units, than we could estimate a 10 unit bill to be around $100, between water and sewer that's $50 each, and $50 seems to be pretty standard for the cities shown in this survey...

A $37 bill I just found shows our usage as 2.  I guess our water usage is just really low, as our bill also has the note about most people using 3 a month.

The fastest way to reduce water usage in your home would be to either replace your toilet with one that uses less water in the tank for each flush, or if you don't want to buy a new toilet, you can replicate the same effect by putting some large rocks, or plastic bottle full of water, or something else that will take up space in the bottom of your toilet tank.  By filling up some of the space, it won't have to fill with as much water before it triggers as full, so you'll use a bit less water per flush.

I'm not saying anything against you.  Welcome to MT.   What I am saying is that you will never comfort the people who are being pushed out simply because new people are coming in.

"Another reason i believe there is a housing crisis is because ya’ll are stuck between a rock and a hard place as far as the the cost of building in your state. This SEEMS to have everything to do with the expenses incurred with running electric and digging wells on undeveloped land. I have seen a few youtube real estate videos urging caution when buying land without doing research on the actual cost of running these basic necessities to build an individual home. Im sure this has played a role in the decision for larger investors to build additional housing. (Which would ease the housing crisis , increasing supply to ease demand and this lowering rental costs) Is it possible that additional housing is not being built because they know it is not an intelligent investment to create affordable housing at such a high cost to initially invest in building, thus the cost of building new homes is being pushed onto the wealthy for personal residence. This then increases property taxes because when the wealthy build homes they go over the top and make high end housing…",t2_am87809u,Rancho8Deluxe,0,1633640908.0,0,t1_hfrz6js,hfrz6js,False,[deleted],t3_q2juor,https://www.reddit.com/r/helena/comments/q2juor/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/helena/comments/q2juor/deleted_by_user/hfrz6js/,1,r/helena,0,1

"Wrote a 4 paragraph response to this and my phone died …lol 😩

Alright lets try this again.

So again I understand what you are saying I apologize for digressing in my response. Some of those ideas were directed at reddit user who just say “screw you transplant” without hearing me out…

However again i have to lead back to my original point in saying that from what i can see the issue you are referring too with supply and demand in your housing market is a political and macroeconomic issue that stems from failures in Government and your landowners/business owners. It is obviously linked to an influx in new residents but the failure i. Housing lies in your leadership not your new residents per say

Here me out

Montana is not the first place to grow. It is not the only place to have this issue. It is unique in the sense that it has extremely expensive plots of land to develop due to the cost of building, running electric and supplying water to said houses , but it is not the first place to grow and CERTAINLY not the only area in America with a large wealth gap.

Me personally i make 70k a year now as a single man in Pennsylvania. I will be taking close to a 40% paycut with my first job in Montana(however after i work my way up this job will pay me exactly the same amount i am making now In Pennsylvania 70k a year gross) i know this because it is a union gig and payscale is made public. 

I am not pricing you out of anything. I spent most of my early 20’s making 350-500 bucks a week living in Roach motels in philadelphia during college. I know what its like to be poor i know what its like to be fine financially and work my way up to being middle class and dig myself out of being lower class. All the while being in boatloads of debt. Not everyone is as fortunate I understand but. It is possible. When i move to your state i will not be working a tech job from home making 150k a year and pricing you out of real estate…i will be working my ass off to earn my place as your neighbor and ill do it with a smile on my face .

Now i will 100% agree that in the BUYING market there is a huge issue with out of staters buying 1-10 million dollar vacation homes or BUILDING new high end homes , which increases property taxes and prices out locals. Also a huge issue is people just coming in And buying homes cash 30-60k above asking and completely slapping locals out of the running for a home. I have been watching your real estate market for  6 years and the inflation rate is insane. I do not know how to solve this issue but i will agree this is a huge issue. However it is not an issue that the rental transplants are contributing to (at least not the demographic of rental transplants that I represent) Most of us are just middle class citizens who worked hard and want to enjoy the fruits of our labor in your great state. Because lets face it. Montana is the shit. MONTANA IS a dream. Not perfect, but a dream state non the less. Its no wonder people are moving there is all im saying. I wanted to move there the first time i drove through in a truck hauling apples from Yakima Valley Washington to Maryland when i was a trucker. It immediately felt like home. Thats not going to go away.

Now its obvious that just telling people they arent welcome, “F-off”, we are full just isnt cutting it. Why? Because a lot of people are wealthy enough to not have to care what anyone thinks. So what needs to happen? (Also i know this is not what you are doing here. Thank you. But a lot of people are doing taking this approach even tho they themselves were transplants like literally 3-5 years ago)

In my opinion the more inclusive Lower AND Middle class Montanans become with transplants the higher the chances there is of everyone brainstorming to come up with solutions. Team work makes the dream work…Also this would make it more likely that people can become more involved with local politics and put politicians in Power who might actually help this demographic out. Do i know the solution? No but I certainly want to learn from all of you and do my best to be a part of the solution instead of part of the problem. But i am not naive enough to think that sacrificing my dream of moving to the state (this is a 6 year long goal of mine that only now i can afford to do) is going to change anything . Its not.

I do have a theory that One by-product of Locals harassing and antagonizing new people is that the new people are probably more likely to vote into power ….OUT OF STATERS….now im not very familiar with your politicians but i have heard this is a problem…and I am willing to bet its happening because of the sour taste everyone has left in Each-other mouths.. this probably leads to a bunch of people in office that dont give a shit about the lower class issues such as housing and lack of wage increases. This combined with work from home covid practices creates a gap too. Anyway just brainstorming here. If there are any ideas of mine you think are completely off base please feel free to correct me I WANT TO LEARN and be a well informed citizen of your state and earn the right to call myself a Montanan .

"It's not whether you're a ""good"" transplant or a ""bad"" one.

"I understand this. Im still struggling to understand the thread of logic that brings a person to believing that is my fault. The issue lies in local politics and macroeconomics within the state. But i do understand people’s frustrations. Just wish there were more ladies and gentlemen (at least on reddit) like yourself who were able to have the civility and clarity to have a conversation about it instead of reaching for the holster immediately. Unless Montana secedes from the United States of America everyone has a right to attempt to start a life there. Unfortunately. If people take the time to get to know me they might understand im moving to the state because of how it is. Not because i want to change it. Planning on doing my best to be the most positive neighbor i can be and lend a hand to the community in any way i can. Im a hunter and an outdoorsman. I am Training to become a Wildland Firefighter currently and have a job lined up as a tree trimmer. I want to find a nice lady and have a family. Perhaps our paths will cross and ya’ll can educate me on what it means to be a true Montanan. But from what ive seen on forums there seems to be a wide disagreement on what that is as well. I love your state. Have since the first day i stepped across your border. When i was trucking and saw truckers dumping trash on the highway i thought about becoming a DOT officer just to harass them so people would stop littering. And i hated the DOT. Not looking to start trouble or change anything. Just want to settle down and start a life there (Just like all the ancestors of all these 5th generation Montanans did a couple centuries ago i might add)

Now I understand that ya’ll have had a ton of bad experiences with transplants for whatever reason they may be. It has been explained to me by multiple people on reddit and by the end of the conversation most of them have turned around and realized that i am probably one of the ”good” transplants. They explained to me that the good ones end up catching a lot of the shit for the bad ones and ya just have to eat it and get through it. I can do that. Im resilient , wouldnt consider moving to your state otherwise. But i would just urge you for your sake to consider that not everyone moving to Montana is the problem. And some of us want to move in, integrate, be a good neighbor, and learn from you.

"I'm not forgetting personal responsibility, but if others around you are not responsible, and there's no mechanism to encourage them to be responsible, in the present situation, it makes it very difficult to live in any kind of social manner.

Example case in point: a friend is suffering from a chronic problem with their immune system. They got vaccinated, but it didn't work very well. They routinely spend weeks in the hospital for very expensive treatments. They have a son in high school. Both parents are extremely cautious, but because the son attends public high school, he is exposed daily to kids who don't mask, and may be at school while they are sick. The consequence is that the entire family takes mulitple tests each week to ensure they are COVID free. If you've ever taken a test here in Helena, results are not quick, and it takes a while to get an appointment. If you have to take multiple tests each week, it is a) very expensive and b) not that effective due to delays. This family can be as responsible as possible, but without the cooperation of their neighbors and fellow citizens, cannot be made safe.

Just as a comparison, check out what's being done in Australia vs. Montana, and then compare their caseload and mortality rates. Montana currently has an average daily case rate of 823 (source: NYTimes), with a population of 1.09 million; Australia has an daily case rate of 1739 (source: Wikipedia 7-day average) with a population of 25.7 million; normalized that's 755/cases/week per million (Montana) and 67/cases/week per million (Australia). 

Now assuming personal responsibility is steady across nations, that indicates to me that good leadership is at least 10x more effective in controlling the pandemic than personal responsibility alone. Granted Australia is locking down everything (I'm not saying we should go that far), but its clear that effective leadership and enforcement is working there.",t2_312gb,captbobalou,0,1631906256.0,0,t1_hd8r3og,hd8r3og,False,spappyjones,t3_ppi4sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/helena/comments/ppi4sg/st_peters_health_we_are_in_crisis_standards_of/,St. Peter's Health: 'We are in crisis standards of care',/r/helena/comments/ppi4sg/st_peters_health_we_are_in_crisis_standards_of/hd8r3og/,2,r/helena,0,2

"It's a failure of leadership at every level:

State: Governor: Failure to empower county health officials to perform their function and allow them to require and enforce masking, restrict large gatherings and require alternative school/work plans when infection rates hit a certain level. Failure to support widespread rapid testing both at the individual level (rapid antigent and PCR) and community (viral load in sewage) and tie those results to emergency response plans.

Legislature: Stupid stupid stupid anti-masking regulation; failure to create an emergency health fund to help hospitals staff up in the case of predicted emergencies.

County: Failure to challenge state officials to restrict and enforce masking and restrict large gatherings and enforce alternative school/work plans when infection rates hit a certain level.

St Peter's: The current crisis was forseeable and predicted back in July. Failure to join with other hospitals to lobby for an emergency fund, rational emergency response measures. Failure to create an attractive work culture at the hospital resulting in staff shortages and low morale.

Local (school board and city): Failure to use all means of moral persuasion to encourage masking; discourage large gatherings, and making alternative plans for schools. 

The level of willful ignorance is so incredibly pervasive here, now, it's really discouraging. I'm typing this while watching a couple dozen kids play like normal, unmasked, at the school across the street, while St. Pete's scrambles to get refrigerator trucks to hold the bodies of people who refuse to get vaccinated, and those who can't get the treatment they need because of the backlog caused by people who refused to get vaccinated.",t2_312gb,captbobalou,0,1631896484.0,0,t1_hd840wd,hd840wd,True,spappyjones,t3_ppi4sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/helena/comments/ppi4sg/st_peters_health_we_are_in_crisis_standards_of/,St. Peter's Health: 'We are in crisis standards of care',/r/helena/comments/ppi4sg/st_peters_health_we_are_in_crisis_standards_of/hd840wd/,8,r/helena,0,8

"Oh I gotcha. So you can drive two separate routes from Lewistown to Helena.  
1) interstate 5 goes from Great Falls to Helena. This is through a beautiful canyon along the Missouri River.  
2) all state highways through Harlowton, White Sulphur Springs, and Townsend. This route is full of some beautiful mountains and prairie however the smoke may obstruct your view. There's a cool wind farm along the route too and a rodeo going on this weekend in White Sulphur Springs. You can also see where a wildfire burned earlier this summer in Deep Creek canyon.   

I've driven both routes over the past few days and they're both clear of any hazards. So you should be fine all the way to Missoula!  

As far as Idaho goes... the Lolo pass and New Perce-Clearwater National forest area has been burning up all summer from the Granite Pass Complex fires. I'm unsure of the current conditions near Powell Junction so I'd recommend doing some good research before heading that way. The drive along Highway 12 is really cool though if it is safe to travel and stay.

"I live on Park and have seen this dumpster driving around all summer.
