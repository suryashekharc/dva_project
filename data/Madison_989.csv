***

A Dane County sheriff’s deputy who was fired for undisclosed reasons in November — a month after saying she shot at a man who stabbed her in Festge Park — likely caused her own injuries with a box cutter while she was intoxicated, according to her termination letter. 

The Wisconsin Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation originally reported the deputy, Sarah Bortz-Rodriguez, said she saw a “suspicious person” while on routine patrol at the park in the town of Berry near Cross Plains at about 8:15 p.m. on Oct. 21. And Bortz-Rodriguez initially told authorities she approached a man who stabbed her with an edged weapon. The action caused her to fire her gun, and she was later taken to a hospital for treatment.

Throughout that night and into the morning, police searched for the alleged assailant. Residents in the immediate area were on lockdown. The investigation turned up no answers, but rather factual inconsistences in Bortz-Rodriguez’s initial statement about the incident, according to a nine-page letter the Wisconsin State Journal obtained from the Sheriff’s Office about her firing.

Bortz-Rodriguez later told authorities — after they pointed out the inconsistencies — that “following an earlier critical incident review at the precinct” she drove around to try and calm herself emotionally, according to the letter.

The deputy told authorities she then returned to the precinct and “traveled to an area near Riley’s Tavern” where she later consumed a substance that is blacked out in the letter. Bortz-Rodriguez afterward decided she was going to “ride out” the rest of her shift, the letter states.

After not notifying a supervisor of her condition, Bortz-Rodriguez told authorities that upon arrival to Festge Park, she felt the substance she consumed take effect.

“You stated that you attempted to clear the park and while driving through ... believed you may have seen someone,” according to the letter. “You stated you believed you ‘really did see someone there’ but now believe you may have ‘hallucinated this stuff.’”

Despite her impaired condition, Bortz-Rodriguez told authorities that she discharged her firearm once, later thinking she may have shot herself.

After authorities asked if she had also caused some cuts to her arm, Bortz-Rodriguez said it was possible, the letter states. Authorities also asked her if a box cutter police found on the ground the night of the incident was likely department-issued — from her squad bag and not owned by the alleged assailant.

“You asked if the box cutter found at the scene was the box cutter from your squad bag,” according to the letter. “You stated ‘if it’s not in my squad bag, then it’s probably on the one on the ground.’ There was not a box cutter in your squad bag when it was examined after the incident.”

The letter states Bortz-Rodriguez was found to have violated several policies outlined in the Sheriff’s Office Code of Conduct — those surrounding truthfulness, “unbecoming conduct,” ethical behavior, conformance to laws, insubordination and work performance. The deputy also violated work rules surrounding the use of property, work performance and “personal actions and appearance.”

Bortz-Rodriguez, 30, had been with the Sheriff’s Office since May 2014.

In a separate letter to the State Journal explaining why portions of a 100-page case report about the incident and termination letter are blacked out, the Sheriff’s Office said it was not disclosing what the deputy consumed “because of the sensitive nature of the investigation and the number of current employees who were interviewed.”

“Release of these records without redactions would undermine the Department’s ability to manage its workforce and to conduct its business, particularly with respect to investigating future internal matters of a confidential or sensitive nature,” the letter from Sheriff Kalvin Barrett and Lt. Brian Hayes states. “Certain medical information provided by the deputy has also been redacted.”",t2_4bvmc,citking,0,1648263745.0,0,t1_i25f61e,i25f61e,False,Rather_be_inthewoods,t3_to9p47,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/to9p47/deputy_fired_for_causing_own_injuries_with_box/,"Deputy fired for causing own injuries with box cutter while intoxicated, firing gun, Sheriff's Office says",/r/madisonwi/comments/to9p47/deputy_fired_for_causing_own_injuries_with_box/i25f61e/,12,r/madisonwi,0,12

"The endgame of this logic is that only papa johns and dominos survive and every small pizza shop goes out of business. 

Small shops truly can't afford to simultaneously eat the astronomical price increases in food ingredients and increase wages while still making a profit that makes staying in business viable.  Big box chains can afford it, however.

Only way small businesses can stay alive right now is by massively jacking up prices charged to consumers, by significantly more than chains will do. 

So unless you're willing to pay 50 bucks for a 16 inch pizza, saying ""pay your staff more lol"" is overly simplistic, to say the least.

You don't need to sympathize with these small local businesses but you do need to understand why you will either need to pay massively more for food you want, or see all your local restaurants die.",t2_bzti3k2w,RokaInari91547,0,1648261110.0,0,t1_i25a51y,i25a51y,False,liquitexlover,t3_to9kgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/to9kgo/rossis_is_short_staffed_and_closed_for_the/,"Rossi’s is short staffed and closed for the weekend.

"I reason with what you said. I also agree, companies have been reporting grossly high profits and doing nothing in terms of helping the ones who got them there or their employees. Big businesses are known to be as frugal and greedy as possible. If they can get away with paying an employee $10, they will because they have no one telling them otherwise. That’s where the problem comes in. People need to work and make a living, what more can they do? I wish the world was more equal. IMO no one needs to have 20 cars, 20 mansions, and billions of dollars. It’s a disgusting amount of money. Why not give back to those who made you become what you are?

"I never said to restrict development. I’m for development. I think what my point is something that’s hard for me to get across in writing is this; 
I would like to see more housing that is realistically priced for those who aren’t earning 100k/yr. and for the housing that DOES exist- to not be income restricted to the point where the rent that is $1300 for 1 bedroom apartments to be 50% of the person’s income MINIMUM! Because those who do almost reach the income limits make more, but those who are significantly lower than the income restriction limit (say someone is working at WholeFoods for $15/hr) they’d make roughly 30k/year (without deducting taxes -also, this is still only 6k below the income limit). This equates to 2.5k/ month. Meaning people who DO qualify for income restricted housing, this would be >50% of their monthly wage. We still need to factor in bills (car payment, student loan, gas, electric, phone) and not only those but FOOD! It just seems like unreasonably high rent for the income restriction limit.

"My drawing is terrible, but basically I (blue blob) made the huge mistake of parking down path A (which is a dead end). Not only was it so tight that I only backed my car out of its spot because the opposite spot behind me was empty, but I realized, to my horror, that there was no physical way to make the teeny 90 degree left turn to that exit (where the top arrow is). Physically impossible!    
  
I started to do that Austin Powers thing, going forwards and backwards in inches, and was turned almost completely diagonal, eyes welling up with tears as passersby wondered wth I was doing. Before getting completely stuck there bumper-to-bumper, I changed my mind and undid my moves and turned right to drive up path B (it’s possible to turn up that way, just not into the exit).    
  
Heart pounding, I made my way up the cramped, skinny path until I found an empty spot to use to turn around. Only then could I exit.    
  
What the DEVIL is the correct strategy for parking here??? Should one just never go down path A?? How do you escape from path A??? Please, I need to know.   
  
EDIT: this brought up a repressed memory of a WORSE garage downtown. Years ago I turned into a garage (which must have been some weird little private one) that let me in but wouldn’t let me out. The little bar raised to let me in, but required some sort of special pass to exit. I had to ask a guy on a bicycle who entered to help me escape.   
  
EDIT EDIT: I remembered another parking garage horror story. I was trying to exit the Monona terrace parking in winter, where you have to drive down that single-lane spiral ramp. They didn’t salt and it was pure ice. My car stopped turning around the spiral, Newton’s-lawed straight ahead into the wall with a crunch, and then my back end swung around until I was facing backwards up the ramp! This all happened in ultra slow motion, and no pumping of the brakes could stop it. A lady in a minivan coming down stopped (somehow, I dunno) and we just stared at each other through our windshields with blank expressions, our vehicles nose-to-nose. I accepted my fate and reversed down the rest of the spiral, the lady and I watching each other the whole way.

"I’m gonna use [this report](https://activelivingresearch.org/sites/activelivingresearch.org/files/Dill_Bicycle_Facility_Cost_June2013.pdf) that looked at the Portland area. They estimate the cost of a one-way elevated cycle track at $68 per foot, or around $350,000 per mile. The distance from Gorham near Tenney park to where university turns into old university (I think a reasonable distance to add a bike lane on university) is ~2.67 miles, so the total cost for that would be close to $1 million. I imagine it’s probably also cheaper because the pavement is already laid. However an elevated cycle track is the gold standard, and a pop up bike lane is at most 1/6 the cost, or closer to $160,000 for the total length. Might differ if we have to get rid of parking.

"You've made a ton of really good points here and while I am usually quite flippant around here, I do actually agree with your well researched ideas (especially about providing housing access to vulnerable populations that traditionally are under represented in city council meetings and positions of power) except for the part where you think I am saying rents will decrease. Rents aren't going down ever, but if we can raise the vacancy rate then we can stop rents from rising so quickly. 

And what I didn't say in my overly-simplistic-by-design comment (but someone else did in another reply), is that the city is also investing in affordable housing and I think we should do A LOT more of that alongside building tons of apartments. 

In summary, my position is: build luxury apartments, build non-luxury apartments, build affordable housing, build affordable housing in so-called ""nicer"" neighborhoods no matter what the NIMBYs say, build condos, build affordable condos downtown, build ugly single-family subdivisions, build duplexes, retrofit older buildings to have more units, tear down the Wonder Bar and build 100s of units. Rents will stabilize (never go down) when there is a 7%-10% vacancy rate. Last I checked Madison was below a 4% vacancy rate. 

The other side of this coin is to get companies to start paying actual living wages so people can get out of the trap that you've outlined regarding qualifying for affordable housing and income restrictions. Clearly those rules are not based in reality and need to be reformed, I can only assume they were put in place in the past when the calculations were different. And I also assume that the basis of those rules were developed primarily with profit motive in mind and not with what's best for the people that need those services. A lot of large companies are making insane profits right now and they are not investing it back into their employees. If wages were higher and there were less people in need of income restricted housing then we could focus those limited resources toward and do more to help the remaining people that still need assistance. There are also probably dozens of other variables involved in this complex issue, housing prices and income cannot be the only things that are important to this discussion. And I am not an expert on any of it so I am not qualified say what those things are but I know there has to be other variables. 

My original Econ 101 comment was only to say that if we can increase the supply then it probably will help take some of the pressure off of the demand.",t2_4tow1x9l,prairiepotatoandsoil,0,1648236880.0,0,t1_i23s5xc,i23s5xc,False,Epidexipteryx,t3_tnpaov,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tnpaov/some_photos_of_the_hillsdale_construction_site/,Some photos of the Hillsdale construction site,/r/madisonwi/comments/tnpaov/some_photos_of_the_hillsdale_construction_site/i23s5xc/,6,r/madisonwi,0,6

"I am not going to sit here and write a long 5 page essay in response to this, because what *you* are saying is that because of these new apartments, people who are able to afford these new places *will* move into *those* new places, and the prices of other apartments will decrease because of this. This only works if the population stays constant, which isn't the case. With a lot of the apartments in Madison being fueled by the student population, the percent growth of students from the enrollment year of 2018 to 2021 enrollment is 10%+ at a rate of 3.3%+ per year. In the last decade, Madison's population has grown 16%. Housing/apartment units have only made a 1.1%+ annual change. The average rent in Madison for a 1 bedroom apartment is $1365 an increase of 48%+ since 2017 at an annual increase of approx.10%+.  Income restricted housing allows a MAX salary of $43,320 for one person. The recommended income to rent ratio is 25% of salary. At this rate, ""income restricted"" housing is almost 50% of annual income with most having a rent of $1300. This is not a feasible ""affordable"" rent as of right now. They require you to spend almost half your monthly paycheck on rent, but you CANT make more than the max limit otherwise you don't qualify. Not only that, but the rent has increased by 7%+ in the past year, even though the growth of apartments have only increased by 1.1%+. All places are still increasing their rent because they can due to the increasing amount wealthier adults with higher education primarily looking for apartments close to the downtown area where all the jobs are located. This allows landlords to price hike the rent because of the demand of housing in the Madison area. By affordable housing, I mean places that don't price gauge the working-class population. Either we make more affordable housing for working class families who can't afford to live in safe and accessible environments without income restriction limits *or* increase minimum wage so that people CAN afford to live in these areas and combat the increasing inflation rate of 7.9%+ for the 2021-2022 year. 

  

>Wait. The things we build now affect the world of the future? Get out of here! It's so much easier to complain that I can't afford an apartment with a dishwasher, multiple bathrooms, in-unit laundry, a fully stocked workout gym, underground parking and a coffee shop on the first floor.

My response to this is; 

I am specifically referring to reasonable accommodations. I am not saying we should make luxury affordable housing, but rather, clean, accessible, SAFE places for regular OR low-income people to live. Instead of sending them to dangerous section 8 housing primarily in places which have high rates of crime. I have never suggested affordable luxury apartments - which is what you're referring to.

Here's an article talking about the racial disparities involved with lack of affordable housing as well as the lack of affordable housing for those who AREN'T white men making 45% more than the average black man/woman. Maybe it will shed some light on *real* issues we should be talking about rather than complaining about people wanting to be able to afford clean/safe/accommodating housing. But yeah, who cares about the lower-income families and the lower-income singles because they don't work as hard as *us. They* definitely don't deserve the same opportunities or even availability as the rest of us smh.

VILAS ZOO DIRECTOR | SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGES
Dane County zoo director to get sexual assault charges dismissed in 2 years under agreement

The director of Dane County’s Vilas Zoo, who has been on leave due to allegations that she sexually assaulted a co-worker during a 2018 work trip, struck an agreement with the city of Seattle in municipal court Wednesday in which her criminal charges can be dismissed in two years if she goes through alcohol and drug information school and follows other rules.

Ronda Schwetz plans to return to work as the zoo’s executive director Monday, said Greg Brockmeyer, director of the county’s Department of Administration.


The alleged victim, who the Wisconsin State Journal is not identifying, called the agreement “utterly thoughtless.” He said the prosecutor in the case told him the deal was offered because “it is just so important that Ronda gets the help that she needs.”

“Everything I have suffered is for nothing because the city of Seattle believes that the defendant is the victim,” the man told the Seattle Municipal Court.

He said he paid $694 to fly from Wisconsin to Seattle to appear in court in person to ask that the judge “hold this defendant accountable.”",t2_4bvmc,citking,0,1648231669.0,0,t1_i23f8gz,i23f8gz,False,MadAss5,t3_tnq9gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tnq9gg/burglar_who_stole_cash_from_vilas_zoo_donation/,"Burglar who stole cash from Vilas Zoo donation box last summer arrested, Madison police say",/r/madisonwi/comments/tnq9gg/burglar_who_stole_cash_from_vilas_zoo_donation/i23f8gz/,49,r/madisonwi,0,49

"A man who stole cash from a donation box in a burglary at Vilas Zoo last summer was arrested on the North Side on Wednesday, Madison police reported.

Carlos T. Davis, 37, was arrested in the 2900 block of Dryden Drive on tentative burglary charges and a Department of Corrections hold, police spokesperson Stephanie Fryer said in a statement.

No additional details were released on the arrest.

Madison police reported after the crime last June 26 that they were called to the zoo, 702 S. Randall Ave., shortly after 11:30 p.m. after private security had responded to an alarm and found evidence of a burglary/

According to security video provided to police, a man entered the gift shop area and stole cash from the donation box.

"Talk therapy can work pretty well if the right behavioral approaches are integrated. This is what the specialized ""cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia"" protocol is for. It's different than just someone who knows generic CBT trying to address insomnia. I tried talk therapy from people who did not specialize in CBT-I without much success, before doing proper CBT-I. Techniques such as ""sleep restriction therapy"" are counterintuitive at first, but really do help. When there are also issues like anxiety or depression (as is usually the case), you also want a therapist who is competent in dealing with them.

">They don't want to talk about that part, knowing how much people will whine if it's explained in full.

I agree that even when it's covered on YouTube channels or articles about how great new cycling infrastructure or road changes have worked out 5, 10, 20 years later people always hand-wave past the fact that a huge part of the reason these design changes work is because they explicitly introduce ""friction"" for drivers.

"Meredith Rumble at UW Health specializes in CBT-I, which is the gold standard insomnia treatment. If your out of network coverage is OK it's probably worth paying a little more to see her. I did CBT-I with her a few years ago and it was very helpful. We ended up using an approach called ""acceptance and commitment therapy"" for the anxiety side of things, which was a good approach for me. My sense is she's good at figuring out what approach will be best for a given patient.

Hm. I think it’s fair to characterize that specific issue like that. I view the case in total as a strategic roll back of federal power in a way that disproportionately negatively impacts racial minority voters.

"> and not on the driver who make terrible decisions

Yeah, we tried blaming the user during the industrial revolution and it just doesn't work. (Quite profitable, however.) In fact, this approach to safety (blaming the user) is a huge reason our roads are so dangerous.

> Jessie Singer: And so early in the Industrial Revolution, you see these massive rises in workers dying. I mean, just huge, untold numbers. And for the employers, it was very easy—and very profitable—to tell a story that the reason people died at work was because they were drunk or they were stupid or they didn’t speak English or they were bad at their jobs. It was really easy for employers to tell a human error story, a story of accident-prone workers. And they really pushed hard on that story. That story extraordinarily benefited them. And what actually changed that equation was reformers starting to look into what the workplace looked like. And the workplace, you know, in 1900 was an extraordinarily dangerous place. I mean, it was just nothing but, like, flying sharp blades, open flames and loose, you know, buckets of dynamite.

Later:


> Jessie Singer: And that I almost want you to hold those things in both hands because both those narratives stand in the way of prevention, because both focus on the last causal link, the bad apple, the human error, the thing that a person did wrong. And if we instead talk about reducing harm, about prevention, about putting a pillow between us and our mistakes, even if that mistake is driving drunk, then we can actually reduce the accidental death toll. Something that Dr. Sue Baker said to me, she was an early administrator of NHTSA and she pioneered the first child car seats, she said, “My most controversial stance is we should make the world safe for drunks. We should make the world safe for drunks because if we make the world safe for drunks, if we make it safe for sleepyheads and people who aren’t paying attention, then we’re all protected.”

"I get that it can be easier to malign someone you disagree with than it is to seriously contend with what they’re saying. But it’s also intellectually lazy. You don’t know me, and frankly, you couldn’t be further off-base in the way you tried to characterize a complete stranger on the internet.

There’s a vast ocean between the dense, vertically-oriented, frenetic reality of NYC and the sprawling suburbia that typifies not only the Midwest but most of the rest of the country — and there is so much opportunity for a middle ground between the two, if only we had the gall to ask for it. To suggest this is a binary choice is to lack imagination.

I’m not the only one out there that finds the suburban landscape full of strip malls, generic cookie-cutter housing with sad grass lawns, and forced car-dependence stultifying and dull. Advocating for mixed-use, walkable neighbourhoods built on a scale designed for people instead of cars makes a lot of sense economically, environmentally, and socially. Also, those sorts of neighbourhoods are incredibly popular. Your values may be different, and that’s okay.

But to your point: how does an approach that explicitly aims to remove barriers to increasing density within existing neighbourhoods contribute to further sprawl? That doesn’t make sense. It’s also far too early to look at Minneapolis’ experiment with this zoning change and draw any meaningful conclusions.

If the pool dropped below a certain number they brought more from outside the courtroom.  I think they kept 16 for the trial, a few were dismissed during the trial for whatever reasons that they could not perform as jurors (one person was ready to pass out when shown a post surgery photo and there were quite a few of those).

"I used iGo (now Enterprise Car Share) and Zipcar for over 10 years when I lived in Chicago. The daily rate was the same as what you put in your post. I think when I started iGo in 2007 the rate was $72 a day and by time I cancelled Zipcar in 2018, it was $79. So for what it's worth, the rates don't rise over time all that much. 

For weekend trips, it is NOT worth the cost. You can rent a car for cheaper especially when you consider mileage and if you are part of a rental points program. I had weekend trips run $350+ due to the extra mileage (my family lived 100 miles away). Regular rentals ran about $30-50 a day. I usually came in around $200 after gas and often got discounted or free rentals from points and also awesome upgrades. (Why yes I will take a luxury rental for the price of an economy. Thanks!)

 For a half day trip or single day, depending on mileage, it is worth it especially for the convenience of being able to just go get the the car without talking to anyone and being able to drop it off and get home quickly and not have to turn the car in the next day to the rental agency. 

Weekends tended to fill up fast so I always made sure I reserved early. Weekdays were never a problem. For holidays, you need to book weeks if not months in advance. I would book for Thanksgiving during the first week or two if September, and many cars would already be unavailable.

And yes, weekend rates do tend to be higher and some vehicles are more expensive than others. From my experience, the rates mostly depended on the gas mileage of that particular car. A SUV type car cost more than a small car like a Honda Fit or something similar. 

For me, the real benefit was short in town trips. I used it most for days I had multiple errands to run and I really didn't want it to take me all day due to walking, busses, etc., or if I was going to buying something large or doing a big grocery trip. I only used it long distances in an emergency or when I couldn't get a regular rental for whatever reason.

All that said, because of car sharing, I didn't buy my first car until I was 31 and only did so because I had baby that I needed to drive around a lot more. If I didn't have a baby, I don't think I would have ever bought a car. I was very happy with my rental and car sharing combo I had going on and I saved a boatload of money on repairs, parking tickets, insurance, etc. 10/10 would do car sharing again if I could.",t2_50ec7,mokanalee,0,1648157247.0,0,t1_i1zfk62,i1zfk62,True,r4iden,t3_tmttsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tmttsm/availability_of_zipcar_or_similar_services/,Availability of Zipcar or similar services?,/r/madisonwi/comments/tmttsm/availability_of_zipcar_or_similar_services/i1zfk62/,6,r/madisonwi,0,6

"I'm using that area as an example because, while this type of neighborhood behavior happens throughout the city, it seems to happen with greater frequency, or at least louder volume, in the Monroe St. area.

There were coordinated efforts against the BBQ restaurant, the building that Trader Joe's is in, the developments near where Michael's used to be, lights on the bike path, etc. The only example that was more of a one off complaint was when someone complained that Art Gecko was illegally using the terrace because along with all of the landscaping that they paid for and maintained there was a stone with the store's name on it.

The Edgewood plan is probably the most longstanding and contentious of these issues but that doesn't mean that the others were cases of a lone crotchety resident shaking their fist at the sky. They were coordinated efforts too.

That's not to say that *everyone* in the area is anti-everything, just that the group doing the complaining seems to know how to be louder than groups in other parts of town.

I apologize, I was lying about an extra $1k lol.  If you want to use median that is $256,900 - $214,700 = $42,200.  

I don't know where you got your percentages, but let's say they are correct.  That would mean Dallas prices increased from an average of $214,710 to $259,800, a $45,090 increase.  Madison prices increased from $285,826 to $328,826, a $43,000 increase.  $ for $ increase, that's pretty damn close.
