As far as parking lot camping, there is the main lot at Palisades, where they MAY ask you to leave.

"Lots of good comments from other posters.

* Heavenly is just fine for beginners.... it's just the cost associated Heavenly or other major resorts, since as a beginner you're not accessing 90% of the runs anyway.
* If you're you're staying in South Lake Tahoe, you're not going to want to drive to Tahoe Donner, Northstar, Donner Ski Ranch, Homewood, etc. You'll spend an hour+ each way driving to one of those places, but that kind of kills your weekend.
* Assuming you are staying in SLT, Diamond Peak & Mount Rose are your best semi-nearby, cheaper choices. If I was just learning, I'd go to Diamond Peak as the cheapest, least crowded.
* If not staying in SLT, I'd look at Donner Ski Ranch, Tahoe Donner, Diamond Peak as best /cheapest places to learn.
* Warm sunny skies may be best for you as a beginner. Dress in layers, as you can get too warm quickly. Sunscreen!

"God last time I was at heavenly there was a windhold on GB/Tram to CA lodge so my friend and I went to take roundabout (typically I ski down GB itself but my friend is not there yet) and the amount of people WALKING DOWN THE SLOPE was fucking absurd!!! 

If you can't ski down roundabout, wait for the fucking windhold to go away and take the chair down.

My 11yo daughter loved NorthStar. A recent trip to Tahoe for her second time boarding. Two days she struggled at heavenly. There really aren’t that many greens and the blues were a bit out of her comfort zone. NorthStar was perfect. More greens and the blues were attainable. Single biggest leap in her progression.

"I'm sure you'll have fun at heavenly, the warm weather and late season will be ideal for smaller crowds I'd assume.You don't want ""good snow"" or powder for a beginner in my opinion (which brings out the crowds and is hard to learn in). For future reference for others in this scenario here's my take.

I've done this not too long ago, most of this is with the idea of kids or brand new adult skiers. You want to optimize for the longest flat greens without a shocking steepness increase. Something I did to check the runs the green skiers would be on was to check [openskimap.org](https://openskimap.org) and find the slope (max and average) for the greens at that resort. Once you go to one resort, you can check its grade and compare with other resorts. With all that said, here's my take if I was doing it again:

1. Tahoe donner - I've never ski'd here but looking at their ski map and the sheer amount green and length + cheap lessons make it look ideal.
2. Mt Rose - Longer maybe more flat than desired bunny hill (show off), then progress to to longer green trails on Wizard lift (somewhat narrow and has more flat spots than desired), to Gallena (starting to move towards intermediate). The big selling point is they have lots of longer green trails that are cutting through forest and it's a better vibe. Put another way, you can ""explore"" different green paths here throughout your learning, whereas other places it will be ""here is one hill, and here is another""
3. Kirkwood - Haven't ski'd these before either but glancing at the map, it seems to be one of the longer green runs for a bunny hill. + a couple gradual upgrade runs before intermediate.
4. Sugar Bowl - Progression here is bunny hill on Judah side, to white pine lift, to nob hill. White pine is shorter than I'd prefer but a nice run to lap and learn turns before heading over to nob hill, and then onto pioneer trail or some of the easier intermediates.
5. Diamond Peak - Schoolyard run is the bunny hill, looks SUPER flat in person, but evidently its steeper than mt rose's bunny hill. Next step up is Lodgepole, which is steeper of a step up than I'd hope for (Similar to sugar bowls nob hill but longer, similar to mt roses galena in length)

Dont do:

Northstar - Lots of intermediate terrain but only greens are very crowded from inflows from all their other trails.

All of this is from the perspective of a very cautious, anxious skier. Some new learners could be bored skiing all those lifts above in the first day or 2 and ready for intermediate blues. Some might spend a few weekends/trips working on turns there before moving up.

"I'll preface this with the fact that I've never taken beginner lessons at Heavenly, so I may be off a bit here...

My assumption is that as a beginner, you'll likely be on the magic carpet most of the day with maybe a few trips up First Ride chair. Both those areas are still open and overall their website says 99% of terrain is still open. So you should be fine for this weekend even with the warm weather we're getting right now. Double check their terrain page on Saturday if you want to be extra safe.

>Heavenly isn’t the best place for beginners.

I disagree with this notion. Their beginner areas I mentioned above are tame and definitely suitable for beginners. Only drawback may be crowds. But this time of year is usually manageable and going on a Sunday is better than Saturday.

"It really comes down to a number of factors with elevation being the primary factor. The warming of the atmosphere is going to hit ski areas at lower elevations sooner than those up here on the summit. The increasing variability in our snow from year-to-year is going to really stress the smaller ski areas around Tahoe and in the Sierra Nevada. In the next 10-20 years, we'll see a lot of them unable to operate during the winter because of the feast/famine conditions that develop. There have already been a few cases of this on the east coast. Even the large resorts are expected to start struggling in the next 20-30 years, which is why many of them are taking a proactive stance in climate change. 

Another factor to consider is that the snow season is getting shorter. In the 70s, temperatures were low enough to ensure that October - May was likely to have snow. We now have temperatures above freezing in October and May, which means that we're seeing less snow and more rain during those months. 

Overall, we're looking at the shrinking of area with snow and the window of when it snows each winter. Most of the resorts in the Sierra Nevada are already having to deal with it to some extent, but it will become much more prevalent in the next 1-3 decades. 


Regarding the argument about whether summer or winter business is better. Lets not forget that our snowpack is a natural deterrent for forest fires that keeps the forest floor and vegetation moist through late spring and, occasionally, the summer on good snowpack years. Removing that snowpack means catastrophic fires every year and, as we noted at the end of last summer, that isn't good for business either.",t2_4ihuf,joi1369,0,1647970156.0,0,t1_i1opniw,i1opniw,False,joi1369,t3_tji9aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/tahoe/comments/tji9aw/with_climate_change_berkeley_snow_labs_mission/,"With climate change, Berkeley snow lab’s mission remains critical [on Donner Summit]",/r/tahoe/comments/tji9aw/with_climate_change_berkeley_snow_labs_mission/i1opniw/,5,r/tahoe,0,5

"I've only been here for a little less than a year so far, but I can tell you that my most memorable moment at the lab was probably on Christmas Day. I had been outside clearing 6-9 feet of snow off of equipment, parts of the building, our propane tanks, etc. and then the power went out. I continued to clear snow and came inside around 6pm to a steak, potatoes, and brussel sprout dinner that was somehow cooked on a super small hotplate by my wife with a headlamp. I was expecting instant noodles for dinner! The ingenuity and dedication to making a nice dinner was awesome and it made shoveling all the snow worthwhile. 

Another one was when we were in the process of building the new instrumentation platform in the middle of October as the atmospheric river (that would eventually dump 3' of snow) was moving in. We were drenched from a rain/snow mix and worked for three days in horrid conditions trying to get it finished.

"This is actually a fairly complex question. The central Sierra Nevada don't have a strong correlation to La Nina for our precipitation, and our snowfall can generally either end up above or below average during La Nina years because there are no strong trends (about a 50/50 shot). So, I would lean towards saying that we haven't had much, if any, snow as a direct result of La Nina. With that said, the El Nino Southern Oscillation definitely has an impact on overall North American weather patterns, so there could be a little influence there. Ultimately, we would need an attribution study to determine the effects of the La Nina on California's snow this winter, which would likely take a year before it could be published. 

Short answer: It's not easy or quick to attribute particular amounts of precipitation to La Nina, particularly in the central Sierra Nevada, so we may be waiting at least a year for an answer to this question.",t2_4ihuf,joi1369,0,1647889699.0,0,t1_i1keedz,i1keedz,False,joi1369,t3_tji9aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/tahoe/comments/tji9aw/with_climate_change_berkeley_snow_labs_mission/,"With climate change, Berkeley snow lab’s mission remains critical [on Donner Summit]",/r/tahoe/comments/tji9aw/with_climate_change_berkeley_snow_labs_mission/i1keedz/,12,r/tahoe,0,12

"Juat expressing my thoughts:
So I finally ticked off Tahoe to ski. The views from every angle are insane, we had bluebird days, sunsets and also a little storm. Everywhere we went was incredibly fascinated to see and absorb, but I feel like the skiing wasn't as good as many other places I've been (apologies to offend).

I feel like, if there had been more snow, the double black bowls on the mountains would've made me tick all boxes. But with the slight lack of snow, I steered away from them (missing my right ACL too from a previous injury).

I'd definitely  love to come back in the summer for more hiking, being on the Lake etc, but I feel like I wouldn't have a desire to ski there again which is different to many other resorts I've been to.

All in all; views were insane from nearly anywhere you go. Food options were good (I'd recommend Riva Grill, Hells Kitchen and Fire+Ice in SLT, also Red hut cafe for breakfast ), the apres was pretty poor in comparison to Europe. But that maybe because I wasn't there during USA holidays. People are all friendly and happy to chat wherever we were.

Hope I don't offend anyone. Just thought I'd share my experience!

**Short-Term:**

""It's getting really frustrating as we get later into the season and we have only been seeing storms in inches and not multiple feet like we normally see in Tahoe. The last time a storm hit 2 feet of snow was 12/27. We just had another weak system Tuesday and another on the way for Saturday, with a falling apart system in the middle Thursday.""  
""...We have been tracking clouds with a falling apart system moving through CA Thursday. That's how pathetic it's gotten, we're tracking clouds. ""

**""Fantasy"" (extended) forecast....**

""High pressure builds in over CA Monday - Wednesday. That will bring a dry and mild pattern. Highs into the 50s at lake level and 40s for the upper mountains Mon - Tue, then possibly up into the 60s at lake level by Wednesday.

The ridge is still forecast to start breaking down by the end of the week. That should bring the highs back down into the 40s & 50s. The European model is still faster to break down the ridge with a trough digging down the West Coast into the weekend of the 26th, and possibly a weak system moving through.

"Honestly, at this point Heavenly has become my least favorite ""big"" Tahoe resort, more than Northstar, for these reasons:

-Crowds: they're even bigger at Heavenly than Northstar. The only place with bigger crowds is Palisades on a powder day, but hey, at least there's powder. Plus the vast majority of skiers at Heavenly are pretty bad, so going down crowded groomers can get dangerous

-Terrain: I think Northstar has pretty comparable tree skiing and groomers to Heavenly. Everyone says Mott Canyon is great, but it's never been open when I've gone. Not really a great asset if it's closed all the time. Gunbarrel is cool, and in theory Heavenly has better snow than Northstar because of the higher altitude, but in general there's not a big difference imo

-Navigation: Once you get out of the base Northstar is fine. Lots of fast lifts. You can easily lap the Backside and Lookout Mountain. Hard to get lost. Meanwhile Heavenly is just a mess. It may be big but it's a huge pain to get around different areas. People call it Flatstar, but it has nothing comparable to the interminable, flat catwalks that you need to ski at Heavenly to get between the CA and NV sides. Which you have to do depending on where you parked, which leads me to...

-Parking. The Northstar shuttle is lame, but there is ample free parking. Meanwhile Heavenly has three tiny lots that are all far apart and fill up immediately, even on weekdays. Then you're left with trying to street park. In December my friends were getting rentals at the village, so I literally had to pay for parking at Harrahs and walk over. Then, if you do park at the gondola, you can't even ski down. We had to wait an hour just to board the gondola to get back to our car.

Overall the Heavenly experience is just more likely to be annoying. Just as expensive and crowded as Northstar, but with even more tourists there for the gambling. The views are cool, but I'm over it.

"Agree with you. Climate change is a holistic problem in the sense that reducing CO2 in the USA is a very small knob compared to reducing CO2 in China and other places where our politics might not prevail. 

The U.S. is terrible in terms of energy consumption per capita.  That definitely needs to be improved! At the same time, we are foolishly considering spending huge amounts of capital to make tiny reductions in the globe's output of CO2, when the actual knobs, the ones that could actually make a difference, are making headway with GROWING CO2 emissions from China and India.

"People don’t like:

1) Not as steep as the other big Tahoe resorts, and there is no real expert terrain. The hardest area is Lookout Mountain, which is considerably less steep than Mott Canyon (Heavenly) or Wagon Wheel Bowl/The Wall (Kirkwood). It’s still somewhat steep, but if you’re a chute loving cliff jumper, you will be sorely disappointed.
2) Parking is a disaster, involving long waits and crowded buses.
3) Saturday crowds are truly “epic.” Seriously, steer clear of Comstock Express on a Saturday morning. Lines can routinely exceed 20 minutes. (Vail is upgrading it to a 6-pack for next season though; we’ll see if it helps.)

There are some awesome things about Northstar too though:

1) Amazing intermediate terrain and groomers. On a weekday you can seriously bomb down them.
2) Best terrain parks in Tahoe, possibly in California. Plus, they have a halfpipe!
3) Really upscale resort. The village is high end, everything is well marked, and almost all the lifts are express chairs.
4) Lots of good tree skiing (although a close second to Heavenly in my opinion).

"This year a Tahoe Local epic pass was $523, but they may raise it next year since their main competitor Ikon charges more than they do. They haven't announced pricing for next year yet. This has holidays blacked out but it gets you access to three of the bigger Tahoe mountains. Plus 5 bonus days at Vail owned resorts in Colorado and Utah. But since it's pretty cheap for access to three of the biggest mountains a lot of people get it so those mountains can get pretty crowded.

Sierra charged $500 for no blackout days last year, $400 with, but then didn't open due to fire. It looks like they are planning on opening for a bit starting in April so they should be open next year probably. I imagine prices will be similar this year.

Diamond Peak is charging $444 if you buy theirs by the end of April and this doesn't seem to have any blackout days.

Sugar Bowl is $669 with blackout days, Mt Rose is $795 with blackout days, there's a $595 option with blackout days and no weekends in Jan/Feb too. Both are more expensive with no blackout days obviously. Homewood is $749 for unrestricted with no option for a cheaper restricted pass. Donner Ski Ranch is $450 but a smaller mountain. Bigger than Boreal, but smaller than Sierra or Diamond. Soda Springs is very cheap, was $239 last year, but is very small, similar to Boreal I think, maybe even smaller. Tahoe Donner is 530 but is smaller than Donner Ski Ranch. Boreal was $529 this year but very small. Ikon Pass gets you both Palisades mountains, but is $769 for the one with blackout days.

In summary, Sierra, Diamond Peak, or the tahoe epic pass depending on how much they raise it are probably your best bet.

Note I just looked up whatever the price was listed on the website for each mountain just now. It's possible some of the ones that were listing this year prices might have better deals for next years pass when they initially go on sale, since it's somewhat common to sell the passes for less at the end of the previous season and then raise it when it gets close to the next season.",t2_473f2,prism1234,0,1647153992.0,0,t1_i0grpyu,i0grpyu,True,CA-ClosetApostate,t3_tbn0o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tahoe/comments/tbn0o0/cheapest_season_pass_options_for_next_year/,Cheapest season pass options for next year (driving from Bay Area),/r/tahoe/comments/tbn0o0/cheapest_season_pass_options_for_next_year/i0grpyu/,3,r/tahoe,0,3

Yes, my goal is to find somewhere with as low a likelihood of encountering dogs as possible, without being one of those people who takes a dog where it's not allowed (I would never do that). I *do not* want my dog to infect any other dogs, that's what I'm trying to avoid, but even dogs with kennel cough need exercise and mental stimulation. This is his one chance potentially for quite a while to experience snow.

I would keep him an absolute minimum of 50 ft away from any other dog on a hike, and would just leave if another dog came to a snow play area. He also wears a muzzle with a stool guard which will minimize forward transmission, especially since he's no longer coughing so any viral load he might have is just in his ordinary breath. The muzzle has two other bonus effects: he cannot lick or closely sniff objects that other dogs might then lick or closely sniff, and other dog owners actually keep their distance if I unexpectedly encounter a dog when I take him on potty walks.

It sounds like there is no official/structured area that meets these criteria, so I'll just drive around looking for a suitable unofficial spot tomorrow and see how it goes.",t2_9ihc4u,nymphetamines_,0,1646969164.0,0,t1_i072v9a,i072v9a,False,[deleted],t3_tbfieq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tahoe/comments/tbfieq/light_hikessnow_play_areas_that_allow_dogs/,"Light hikes/snow play areas that allow dogs, especially off-leash?",/r/tahoe/comments/tbfieq/light_hikessnow_play_areas_that_allow_dogs/i072v9a/,2,r/tahoe,0,2

"That's fair. I guess anywhere I'd know about ahead of time is likely to have other dogs. I'll just scope out some empty areas and leave if other dogs come.

Feeling like I shouldn't have even mentioned the kennel cough since people are fixating on it. I don't let my dog interact with strange dogs on hikes anyway so it's essentially irrelevant; he'll be social distancing more than adequately.

I live in an apartment so dog-friendly that it has its own dog park, so I find the concept of my dog not existing in any space a dog might eventually be in pretty unrealistic.

"Fire restrictions are seasonal.  They vary by severity of the current season.   Some times it is a partial ban, others times it is a complete burn ban. It can even get to the point where the forest is closed. This could mean no fires in campgrounds, in homes fire pits, and even no propane stoves.   
Usually if there is a bad fire danger, the restrictions will come in in phases.  No fires  except in designated campgrounds.  Or, no burning yard waste.  Then it will get more restrictive as the danger increases.  Every years is a little different.

"From my experience:

* The tram at Palisades is a huge box that holds 10s of people, but it's slow.
* The funitel is more like this, but it holds about 9 people seated and often another 3-5 standing per car.

\*Re Alpine:\* My hope is that this spurs investment there. If it's possible to add a lift or two to access the tons of bowls/terrain above Kangaroo in the front or to skier's right of Sherwood at the back, you'd double (or more!) the amount of easily accessible advanced/expert terrain very fast.

\*Re 16min:\* That's typically faster than driving from one to the other b/c it's hard to find parking. Additionally, there's a lot of times there are lessons or events at one and not the other, so getting easily from one to the other without messing w/ parking is *really* useful.

">Instructors still see a pittance of the cost of a lesson

Yes, tip your instructor.

>doing it on the side is a good idea

Except that your side-hustle instructor isn't insured, and you and the instructor risk lifetime bans from the resort group (Vail in the case of Northstar) as well as prosecution.  There are all sorts of reasons this is a terrible idea. No professional instructor will do this - which means that the quality of the instructor you get is questionable.
