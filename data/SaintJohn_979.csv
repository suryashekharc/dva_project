"SJ is not bike friendly...for many reasons: 1) no real dedicated lanes on the flatter roads, 2) cars will nearly hit you (if not hit you) and won't care most of the time, 3) not many spots to lock your bike up (trust me - you will want to do that!), 4) it's really not safe this early into Spring (roads have too much gravel, snow build up in spots, and lots of little things which will make you wipe out or get a flat), 5) there are laws, not enforced as SJ Police are understaffed & won't stop a speeding car.

depending where you are and where you need to go, walking is almost the safest method for the next 2mon.  You can jump on the bus (if you figure out that f'd up schedule) when needed.   Weather is still cold for daily bikes (possible snow coming still).

Harbour passage is one of the better safer routes (there is a speed limit and courtesy to walkers).  Sadly, sidewalks are safer than on the side of the road.

it is law for a helmet and believe it or not -- a bell! (didn't know that one until a few years ago)...that's a NB law which could be enforced easier.

"Riverfront? yeah sure, it's underutilized, but nowhere near as close to underutilized/ undervalued as the oceanfront.   We don't have a ferry anymore, we have no legal way to get to Partridge Island, our oceanfront beaches get almost no investment, and on both the West Side and East, the harbourfront is dominated by industry/ almost completely off limits for the public.  Other than going for a walk on the beach, or hiking the nature park, there's almost no places to have a beer while sitting back watching the waves roll in, other than just bringing a beer to the beach yourself.    


I'm not sure there's a single restaurant or bar with an ocean view that is not Uptown, and Uptown's ocean views are nothing compared to what can be found on the West Side or up Redhead way.    


I'll never understand why people are so obsessed with the river valley here in the Saint John area... it IS very scenic, but so is the Bay of Fundy. Saint John must be one of the only coastal metro areas in Canada where people pay more to be FURTHER from the ocean.  Imo,  (the ocean) is the single greatest thing going for this city, our coastal areas are even more underdeveloped than our riverfront areas.  Dominion Park is getting a huge investment, and that's great, Dominion Park is great, but so is Seaside Park, so are Bayshore/McLarens/Saint's Rest Beaches... and Tin Can beach too! I feel our ocean beaches need far more investment and caretaking than they currently get.  I know back in the day there was some sort of beachfront bar/ dance hall on the West Side... but right now, there's not even a single store or even an ice cream stand anywhere near our ocean front beaches.

"Saint John seriously underutilizes the riverfront.

"Sorry, this is pretty masturbatory but it got me thinking: 
I grew up around the falls and spent a lot of time down by the water watching them. So many memories are tied up with that area; the bridge, the lookout, the Murray & Gregory buildings. 
The old ships on the Lancaster Ave side of the falls. 
I walked across the bridge to and from school most days. The bridge would sway in the middle when big trucks would go by -sometimes I’d run to get to the middle, sometimes I’d run to get away from it. Later i spent a lot of time under the bridge out in the middle fighting a fear of heights and doing the stupidest things. 
Friends and I would drink and and do drugs down by the water and once one of us fell in -I shudder (and smile) at the memory. 

The sound of the water was a constant. 
The occasional suicides and attempted suicides were heart-breaking. 
The pulp mill used to let off pressure and the house would shake. 
My dad died there. I lost my virginity there. Fell in love -and broke my heart a few times. I was molested within earshot of the water. I made music there. 

I could go on for days but you were asking what locals thought about it: It was normal to the point of never thinking about it. As i got older i sometimes thought ‘why are we making this something it isn’t?’ or ‘why are we calling this Reversing *Falls*. I also felt really possessive of it like it was all mine. When the Zipline place went in I felt like it was a bother because it brought more people -selfish and silly of me but that’s what i felt. 

The tourist stuff always felt crass and annoyed me but now that I’m older i get why it existed.

"You have no idea how much Conservatives and Liberals hate the CBC. I would also guess that any political party forming the government would grow to, at least, resent the CBC. 

The CBC has done a spectacular job of biting the hands that feeds it over the years. 

The idea that the CBC is a mouthpiece for the government is, and always has been, wrong. 

That’s not to say that the CBC is perfect -or the ultimate form of providing journalism; but it has consistently done its job well. 

Unfortunately governments really have found a way to destroy the CBC -cut after cut after cut has left the CBC a shell of what it once was -they had to lay off technicians (and it shows to this day). Then journalists had to try and be technicians and journalists. With further cuts journalists were let go and those remaining are doing a job that used to be done by 4 or 5 different people. All this is starting to show but still they aren’t anywhere close to being ‘State Media’.

Here is Saint John's zoning by-law: https://saintjohn.ca/sites/default/files/2021-02/Zoning%20By-Law_0.pdf

Agricultural use applies to RS, RR, and RMX zones (different flavours of rural areas). 

Find out what your property is zoned as and then you can look up what's allowed and what's restricted in your area. For example, in RR (Rural Residential), you can have up to two goats as long as you have at least 6000 square meters, and more goats with more area. And other restrictions. Other zones have other rules. 

I may not be understanding the document properly, but it might only be allowing for the continuing of **existing** agricultural uses at the time the by-law was made. There's a line in the RR section for example that says:

> While this designation contains *existing* or approved residential subdivisions, such development is no longer encouraged in this designation.

"So re: the cold water, that is not universal. The Bay of Fundy is uniquely shaped, being long, narrow and very deep so cold water is always being churned back up and Nova Scotia blocks the warm Gulf Stream. The Atlantic coast of NS has fewer nice beaches, but the water is marginally warmer. The money is the Strait between PEI and the mainland, warmest water north of the Carolinas, allegedly. Actually warm enough to swim, and I'm quite fussy about that. Usually I don't get in north of Cuba, but from the bridge to the island all the way up to about St. Anne-de-Kent is relatively shallow and will warm in the summer. The warmth will sometimes cause problems to algae blooms and jellyfish, but you were coming relatively early so it usually takes to the end of the summer before Parley Beach gets really gross.

"I grew up a short distance from the Pacific, but haven't been to the Atlantic ever. And definitely not to any place with such vertical tide range.

So it's cold year round. RIP. I assume that is universal for other Maritime provinces like NS and PEI. It makes more sense that the coast has variable terrain, but Google image results are certainly skewed to some popular spots and gave me the impression that they are more homogeneous. The lack of lifeguards even in popular locations is certainly indicative of how people tend not to swim/surf. 

However, what is not as variable as the terrain across the bay is probably the tide cycle, right? Or do different parts of the bay will have different time for low/high tide? I will head back to mainland as soon as slack tide ends just to be on the safe side. 

We will probably buy our seafood in the store too, but I was considering clam digging as a potential fun family activity when we are  at the beach. Just want to make sure it's not illegal if we ever decide to do so.

"So, you've never been to the Bay of Fundy and you don't live near an ocean, right? Similar answers to both questions. Technically swimming and clam digging are legal wherever, but there are serious safety and practicality concerns with both. 

First, the Fundy coast has wildly variable terrain. Lots of granite rocks and cliffs. Beautiful, but no clams and if you were crazy enough to get in the water you'd likely be bashed against the rocks. There are lots of rivers and streams breaking this up, plus more sheltered bays and coves, so you will get a mixture of mud flats, marshes, and the odd sandy or gravel beach. Obviously mud is where you'll get bivalves, and some of the beaches are safe to swim at, conditions permitting.

 Surf will depend on the tide and weather and may or may not be dangerous. Generally don't get in anything where the waves are breaking higher than your waist or crossing each other. Rip tides or currents are rare, often a warning will be posted if it's relevant. There's unlikely to be a lifeguard, even at popular locations, but other people around are a good gage of how safe it is. There are swimable beaches at the end of the peninsula the town of St. Andrews is on, plus by the campground/ferry landing/Old Sow on Deer Island and at New River Beach provincial park. There are definitely more, but those are easy to find, popular and actually pretty nice. However, all that said, the water in the bay is ridiculously cold all year round. Lots of locals go to the beach, but it's mostly playing in the sand and enjoying the scenery. Maybe jumping in the surf. The only people totally immersed are children and the foolhardy. 

If you must, I'd time it so the tide has just come up over the sand after its been baking in the sun. That sometimes warms up the water enough to make it tolerable. This ties into the point about the tides and their influence on beach activities. It's important to remember when we say 20 or 30 or even 50 foot tides up at the far end by Moncton, this is a vertical measurement, not horizontal. If this is next to a cliff it doesn't matter, but a beach can go from just a few meters of sand at high tide to hundreds when it's low. There are islands you can walk to at low tide that you very much cannot at high tide, and you will be stuck there if you don't come back in time. It moves fastest in the middle part of the cycle, sometimes 4 or 5 feet an hour, even in the relatively calm western end of the bay, so changes can happen quickly. Look out for things like seaweed on rocks (some of which can be over your head), wet rocks, the collection of debris at the typical high tide line, that kind of stuff. It really is walking on the bottom of the ocean. Always assume the next wave will go further than the one happening now. 

Clams apparently don't require a license, and you are allowed to take them up to 100 a day from April to December. The trick is to find a safe place with enough mud and no industrial contamination or red tide. If the clams aren't safe to eat there will usually be signs. The only place I know off the top of my head where the stars align for this is Little Lepreau basin off Maces Bay. I've seen decent sized groups digging there last summer. No idea if anyone does tours for that. Not sure anyone's asked before. It's hard, dirty work. We usually just buy clams at the store. Don't buy them from some guy's trunk in a parking lot. You don't know where those clams came from.",t2_7epjjjn2,Unusual_Pitch_608,0,1647090827.0,0,t1_i0d5knn,i0d5knn,False,cogitatingspheniscid,t3_tb2sn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb2sn1/whalewatching_in_june/,Whalewatching in June?,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb2sn1/whalewatching_in_june/i0d5knn/,2,r/SaintJohnNB,0,2
"I bought an ebike last year and have been using it daily to get from the north end to uptown daily (through snow, ice, hurricaines, wind, ..) and have used it all winter up until market slip got fenced off.  It's a great way to get through the city but I'll admit the lack of safe infrastructure does make it pretty scary in most places.  All the key connections between areas of the city are all provincially controlled (rte 100 & overpasses) and we all know how helpful the province has been to Saint John.

Going West-North means the reversing falls bridge and simms corner (turning left onto Douglas Ave is pretty scary), Irving Nature Park means taking Catherwood, going to Sobeys North means taking Lansdowne, central up to rockwood means a jaunt up the big crown st. bridge and so on.  

On my $1200 ebike with 3"" tires I've had no issues with weather or hills in Saint John.  It's a common  excuse given.  I biked right up Main St during a snowstorm a couple weeks back where I watched cars struggle with traction going up through the lights.

"Johnny, with respect because I love the city and I sense your love is sincere too, you have to come here if you are going to write here. The city herself is a character, and you should meet her if you are to do her justice. She is a complicated lady.

Reversing Falls would be an excellent start, with all its misnomers and contradictions, beauty and brutality. The Falls are underwhelming at first, down an obscure side street, past the abandoned store that's been for sale as long as I can remember, past the run down industrial lot and the zip line office trailer, around the overgrown parking loop infested with invasive plant species, next to the public washrooms, in the shadow of the last remaining mill on this part of the river, a towering behemoth that devoured all the others, and the fermenters the last real Canadian brewery.

If you timed it wrong, there might not be much apart from the squabbles of the gulls and the geese on the islands that create the rapids, now buried somewhere in the 20+ foot tides. But maybe you came when those islands have seemingly doubled in height, at the lowest point of the tide they really almost do seem like falls as the river emerges from the harbour. Or maybe during that brief calm of slack tide, where the water that was impassible rapids three hours ago is now still like a lake, until that stillness is shattered by the roar of a speed boat rushing to avoid the wait until the next tide to go back to the marina. But back to that first, boring moment. Having now seen low tide, you get the feeling something is off. The river is actually flowing backwards, as salt water overpowers the flow, reversing the falls. Seals bob in the water, following the fish sucked in with the water. The gulls circle and squawk, disturbed some tourists are now zip lining towards the tower they were occupying. It's the kind of place that grows on you, that repeat visits are necessary to appreciate the dynamics of the landscape. 

And yeah, then there's the friggin' bridge, and the place where the gas station blew up, the kitchy restaurant next to the park that's actually owned by the guy who owns the mill across the street so it's not a public park, but it used to the location of the provincial asylum, which is a whole other thing. Complicated Johnny.

"Specifically unique? I don't think so. Honestly, I haven't personally been, but my understanding is it's just better odds of seeing rare things like whales or unusual birds, especially migratory ones, because of its remote location which is itself the most unique thing about the place. Its allegedly beautiful, but so are a lot of places in the region. It's worth it if you want to max out the odds of seeing a whale or the most possible bird species, or the least possible light pollution at night, but if you are on a schedule it's quite the time bandit, plus the possibility of weather either cancelling the ferry or making it pointless to go due to fog negating all visibility, and the very limited amenities on the island itself.

"As a local, I found the geology/science behind it cool. From my layman’s understanding, it’s essentially an underwater waterfall and with the combination of the high tides that’s what makes it look like the river is running inland. And add that the rocks on either side of the river belong to two different continents is pretty neat too. 

But aside from that, I see it as a neat feature and don’t really think about it aside some mild paranoia about somehow falling into it when crossing the bridge. (Which I will never do on foot, only in a vehicle.)

"> Did the Irvings purposefully build everything as far from everything else as possible to make walking a nightmare so more people would get cars and get more gas?

You're not too far off the truth. It wasn't the Irvings, but it was decades of corporate lobbying in the US and Canada. The city planning trends we have today wasn't the result of public opinion, efficient operations, or even a simple accident.

Single family zoning was invented to sneakily prolong segregation after the US supreme court banned it. Jaywalking was invented by the automotive industry so that they could monopolize streets and dodge responsibility for fatal from accidents. They lobbied for legislation to make jaywalking illegal across the US and Canada and they also pumped out marketing to make it socially unacceptable. At the same time they outright purchased and shut down any private companies operating trams and other forms of mass transit. The idea of highways straight through the center of town and living miles from groceries and work was invented by GM for the 1939 world's fair.  They then lobbied the federal governments in Canada and USA to invest billions of taxpayer dollars transforming our continent into that oil-dependent nightmare.

In more modern decades GM killed of EV projects and lobbied for legislation banning alternative forms of transportation. Did you know that E-bikes/scooters/skateboards over 500W are actually illegal in NB? It's also illegal to ride a bicycle on sidewalks despite the complete lack of cycling infrastructure in this province.",t2_5zpvr,Vok250,0,1647025188.0,0,t1_i09x290,i09x290,False,AidanInFreddy,t3_tb7cqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb7cqx/ditching_car_due_to_high_gas_prices_media_call_out/,Ditching car due to high gas prices (media call out),/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb7cqx/ditching_car_due_to_high_gas_prices_media_call_out/i09x290/,7,r/SaintJohnNB,0,7

"I've only been out in early or mid-August and it was mostly minkes and right whales. This year I'm aiming to get out later in August for a shot at some humpbacks.

Jolly Breeze in St Andrews is the one I've used most, though they're all good. All the whale watching outfits co-operate and help each other out with regards to letting the each other know where whales are spotted. I just checked and it looks like you can book something from June 11 onward, though at this point there seem to be only one or two outings per day.  

I like going out on the zodiac, but the bright orange survival gear is definitely going to be needed and it's not flattering on anyone. Be there early -- they don't screw around with lates/no shows. 

They also have a tall ship which is a bit more sedate and more appropriate if there are younger kids or people who don't want their bones rattled. It's not as exhilarating as the zodiac but you've still got a shot to see something.

The best part of any of those tours is when they cut the engines and you're just floating on open water waiting to see if a whale is going to spume. Sometimes there's porpoises and there's always seals. But between the silence, the water, the smell of the air and the chance to see some whales... it's pretty peaceful. Most of them offer snacks at some point in the tour, as well. It's usually something like hot cocoa and a ginger-molasses cookie or pea soup but it probably depends on who you go with.

Rothesay Ave is considered a ""Barrier to Cycling"" in official City documents.

"Some parts seem to get more wind than others. I live in East SJ and it can get pretty damn windy. In the summer, it's great -- no need for AC if you just open your windows. Also, when you've got a nice breeze, you don't have to worry about flies/wasps/mosquitos as much when you're just chilling outside.

I'm up high enough that flooding isn't a big concern but the wind stole an awful lot of my shingles before I got my roof replaced in 2020. There are less windy parts of SJ but I think they're wherever the word ""Heights"" isn't used as the neighbourhood name, or are further away from open water.

"Checking in from Vancouver here - Rent control (here) is only for the residential side. 

Commercial is MUCH MUCH different. Most leases here are fixed term and some 7 to 10 years sometimes (not Month to month after a year like resi) - owner responsible to pay out whole lease even if they close doors!)  And also commercial comes as tripple threat. So in this case - the bakery would pay the lease, pay the property tax / or their portion depending on sq/ft of the whole property;  and pay all repairs and maintenance. The landlord just collects $$$. We lost near every small business and all we have now are big chains as they are the only ones who can take the loss. 

But you are 100% right that resi rents NEED to be controlled in NB ASAP. Trust me - none of the landlord buyers are real people. They are laundering money from drugs since a smart business person would not pay 3 times asking. They would by 3 units! Vancouver RTB caught them in time (basically because they started using single family homes so the local criminals could get in on it too) but your rents are getting too high for the populations. I pay about the same here as I would in SJ (as your prices are really only 3 years behind ours) and I have been here 5 years (and rent can;t rise more than 2% per year)

"We are in a fantastic location.  We are on the water, but still in the city (in West Saint John).

In terms of cost, you can pretty much have the nicest penthouse condo in the city for $600K.

If you just want a normal 3 bedroom house in a nice location, you can basically buy anything you want for $400K or less.  I think there are maybe a dozen listings in the entire city for more than $500K right now.  Most properties are sub-$300K.  Basically, if it's more than a half-million it's likely a 5+ bedroom with acreage or a penthouse condo in a heritage building.

"I second the YNAB app. I work as a Financial Advisor  and several of my clients use that. You have to be diligent with it though. It is also a paid service I believe too. If that's not an option then just Google budget sheets and you'll get lots of options to you. But like the YNAB app they are only as useful as the effort put into it. As I'm sure you're aware this person needs to start taking their situation seriously or it will not end well for them. 

As for services to help bridge the gap from the 1st to the 4th. There's nothing that's good options for that. Most people turn to payday loans but PLEASE do not let them do that. As a former landlord as well I appreciated when a tenant came to me ahead of time and explained the situation and I would work with them. Now the bridge might already be burned if they have been late so many times and any heads up was not given. 

I would suggest short term pain of cutting something else back for a month if possible to make sure the rent is available in full for the 1st. Yes it will suck for them but it's better then potentially losing their home.

"The problems SJ has always had were issues with weather (Fog) an higher taxes, and by simply being out of the fog belt, people enjoyed the outskirts more and their cheaper taxes, and ease to build. Similar to Vancouver, SJ is prohibited to build in most many directions due to surrounding terrain and the Bay of Fundy. There is certainly room to make it more dense (if not get people back into the deserted buildings) but that comes with challenges. AIM plant for one keeping people up at night and the west side water fiasco, are certainly roadblocks to making folks want to come back. 

As for the subburbs - perhaps we have seen enough cul de sac subdivisions, but the surrounding towns of the city are certainly great places to live too. What would be great is to see more services expand there - or at least bring back what used to be like small grocery stores. I am sad watching Canada become either mega city or farmland with nothing in between. It would be nice to see small village and town life reborn especially with WFH and Hybrid becoming popular.",t2_15v3zc,imageekette,0,1645125884.0,0,t1_hxci1xz,hxci1xz,False,rorix39,t3_sq1ty1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sq1ty1/saint_john_adds_2300_residents_since_last_census/,"Saint John Adds 2,300 Residents Since Last Census.

"The owner John has actually been in Quebec all week testing out new skis with the major ski manufacturers. He has been working in the industry for over 35yrs. He used to work at the old sports shop in Sussex tuning up skis when he was in high school. All of his staff are outdoor people. They test a the products they sell personally. So they know how it works and can give you advise based on their own experience. 

Extremely knowledgeable and helpful.

Just an FYI... they are closed Mondays. The staff take a mental health day and hit the slopes on Mondays.

"I've lived in a few parts of town. When I first moved to north end, I found out after a few days that my downstairs neighbors were DRUG DEALERS and there would be people ringing my doorbell at all hours of the night.

Luckily my landlord evicted them before I had to go through the bother of moving all my stuff out again a week after moving in to a new place.  The house next door had a bunch of strange people living inside that would pile their garbage up behind their house. Literal RATS would run out of the pile. The city kept trying to make them clean it and I felt so bad for their neighbor on the other side because they were closer than me and a lot of the garbage would blow in his otherwise neat yard with nice fence. The city eventually came with police, tractors , bulldozers and a dumptruck to clean it up.

Well it’s not affordable for the local residents based off the average income.

Personally I am buying two properties cash, one to live in and another rental for supplemental income. 

Won't be long before SJ prices skyrocket either as Ontario and BC have quite literally run out of homes for people to buy. We let in 400k immigrants and 700k student visa's every year. Everywhere will get eaten soon if us Canadian's can't get a government that will actually do something about it.

"Or just buy a nicer house in Saint John… stop this bullshit narrative that people “who can afford it” should live outside the city, while only those who can’t afford it should live in Saint John.

The last thing we need is more of the top income earners in Saint John moving outside the city.  It’s been a big enough problem already, but actually somewhat alleviated by all the people moving here.  I can only imagine the type of shit real estate agents end up telling people to stay out of the city though... I know one of my dad's doctors was basically steered clear of Saint John in favour of Rothesay by the agent that helped find them a house, and I'm sure this happens quite often with high income earners who move here and buy houses. 

(If we didn't have all these new people coming here tho, who haven't been brought up on these stereotypes about the various communities in the greater Saint John area, I'd be ***very*** concerned about the future of the city... if the new people from outside of NB keep coming tho,  I think our city has a very bright future!

If you can afford a nice big house in KV, you can also afford a nice big house in Saint John... until we amalgamate (which may be never), just please cut the fucking snobbery.  I've never lived in a city more divided, or one that had such parasitic suburbs.  It's one of the more unpleasant realities of living here, but selfishness and systemic inequality between the communities here are holding the Saint John Region back as a whole. Just because some people can afford the suburban commuter lifestyle and like it better than living in the city, shouldn't mean that the said city they are a suburb of should suffer. The reality is that mass exodus of Saint John's top income earners from the city to the suburbs over the last 50 years has created vast inequalities between Saint John and its suburbs... this urban flight remains a top cause of Saint John's fiscal troubles... Most of those SJers who moved to KV are never coming back, but people from other parts of Canada or other countries... we can at least do our best to get THEM to come live in Canada's oldest city, even the rich ones who can ""afford"" to live in ""the valley"". 

If we don't get amalgamation anytime soon, we need to actually see some real cooperation and much more meaningful contributions from the surrounding communities for this ""Great Saint John Area"" thing to work properly or even close to ""fairly"".

"[Saint John requires a permit](https://saintjohn.ca/en/city-hall/planning-building-infrastructure-and-heritage-conservation/permitting-and-inspection) for anything built including a storage shed - so you'd have to pay to have your plans reviewed by them at the very least to see. 

* Tiny homes fall under mobile/ RV homes usually and so don't (often) follow Canada Building code / Local code since they are not meant as ""permanent residence"".  Though they can be built to structure code perhaps - these homes have to watch out for weight restrictions (for transporting them - hence they can use less heavy materials.) 

* Also remember that part of codes deal with safety. ex -  if a hallway in a tiny home can't fit a stretcher for an ambulance for example. That is why codes for new builds are examined closely. 

* Main issue you have to address too- your tiny home would need to be placed on a solid foundation and have the proper city utilities and codes in said foundation for the sewer and water hookups. (you'd have to read up about what they are.) Above ground pipes will freeze of course

* Worse still - your tiny home plans could get quashed by simply not fitting into the Style, by laws, planned use for the street its on. Many dumpy buildings uptown, are as they are, since they considered heritage. You can't build new or renovate unless you source materials that are the same as what exists there. Often older style materials were cheaper 100 years ago, they are more expensive today. The ROI for delvelopers/ owners is often not there to do too much. 

* That said - if you just want a tiny home - buy something about 1.5 acres outside of a city/ town/ village and you should be able to place the tiny home on it as you choose (need to BYO water and septic system though). I recall there is some [NB legislation](https://snbsc-planning.com/cct/building-permit-qa/) that said country lots with a building of less than 600 sq feet may not need stamped lumber or follow code.

"Something to keep in mind as well is that after being in the same place for a year, at the end of the next August you can request equalized payments. They take your energy use for the past year and average it out over the year so you pay the same amount every month. Our first year in an old house the power bills for Dec and Jan were over $500 each. But in the summer, we were below $100. So we went on equalized payments and pay about $250 per month no matter how much power we use. Every September/October they re-evaluate and if you used less power than you paid for, they issue you a credit. If you used more, you pay the difference. There's been years where, due to using less power in a year, I had a credit that covered almost 2 months worth of SJ Energy payments. But there was 1 year where we used a lot more power and ended up having to pay about $150 difference. I paid it over 3 months so it was only an extra $50 per month. It works for me.

ETA: You should keep your heat at a consistent level all day. Turning the heat off and on causes spikes in power usage since the start up will use a ton of power to get up to heat. Best bet is to keep your apartment at around 18 degrees in rooms you spend most of your time in and a little lower in those you don't (around 15 degrees) in the colder months. It's a lot more comfortable to enter an already warm home and it uses less power than constantly changing the heat levels.",t2_4n5k47dg,narmstrong13,0,1644421611.0,0,t1_hw8ja1w,hw8ja1w,False,Character-Ad-5055,t3_s1knkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/s1knkv/sj_energy_charged_250_for_heating_last_month/,SJ Energy Charged $250 for heating last month,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/s1knkv/sj_energy_charged_250_for_heating_last_month/hw8ja1w/,2,r/SaintJohnNB,0,2

"You should definitely reach out to the Rentalsman's office Monday _before_ you talk to the property manager. Tell them everything and ask for their advice dealing with this person.

It doesn't sound like this person has criminally harassed you, but they may so keep detailed notes and/or video of any incidents.

"We were told an elderly lady lived there whose children had all abandoned her at one point or another. She was terribly lonely, and never left the house (we thought it was one house, not an apartment building, so shows how much credibility the stories have already lol). After years of staying inside her home, she started to see things, hear things; but instead of ignoring them as her imagination like she always had, she gave in and started talking back to the spirits in the house. She eventually went mad, and people could hear her either laughing or screaming through the windows in the summer. She eventually died in the house but no one found her for a very long time. Eventually new people moved in, but they quickly moved out when they kept seeing the woman as a ghost. People would move in and out, over and over throughout the years because no one could handle it. Apparently kids that went to the house trick-or-treating would knock on the door but no one would ever answer. The door was always unlocked though, and those few unfortunate children that went inside were never to be seen again. 

I can't remember the other ones as vividly. I just remember that one because I adore Halloween and I was so upset that I couldn't go there.",t2_e6aeyvr7,Jacrispea,0,1643915829.0,0,t1_hvgj5sv,hvgj5sv,False,magicandmintwafers,t3_sizfvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sizfvf/does_anyone_know_the_history_of_this_place/,Does anyone know the history of this place?,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sizfvf/does_anyone_know_the_history_of_this_place/hvgj5sv/,2,r/SaintJohnNB,0,2
"As others have said, the right tool for the job is key. Metal scoop shovel, heavier headed long handle shovel, bucket scoop, etc... depending on what you're trying to clear (stairs, walkway, driveway) and snow conditions (light and fluffy, wet and heavy).

If you are going to get just one I would get a metal scoop shovel.",t2_4dn3flb5,el_iggy,0,1643913126.0,0,t1_hvgbqum,hvgbqum,True,Character-Ad-5055,t3_sjnsq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sjnsq5/shovel_recommendations/,Shovel Recommendations,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sjnsq5/shovel_recommendations/hvgbqum/,4,r/SaintJohnNB,0,4

"Buy 3, preferably a variety.  I have a straight shaft one, an ergonomic bent shaft one, and a large scoop.

The bent shaft one is easier to lift snow straight ahead, the straight shaft one is easier to throw snow sideways.  The scoop gets filled up, pushed up a ramp and dumped.

But the snowblower does the majority of the work for me.",t2_jlgiq,mks113,0,1643910773.0,0,t1_hvg56li,hvg56li,True,Character-Ad-5055,t3_sjnsq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sjnsq5/shovel_recommendations/,Shovel Recommendations,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sjnsq5/shovel_recommendations/hvg56li/,19,r/SaintJohnNB,0,19

"The shovel I get the most value from is my massive bucket scoop. [One of these bad boys!](http://cdn-tp1.mozu.com/24871-37656/cms/37656/files/0a8a7067-5f54-49f8-be9b-2c24a2dba38c). It moves a huge volume of snow and slides around on the ground so it doesn't require much effort. YMMV though. My wife isn't strong enough to use it.

I also own two other shovels. It's a ""right tool for the job"" kind of thing. I have a small square spade for my walkways, stairs, wet heavy snow, and deep snow. When I physically cannot use the scoop, I have to resort to the little shovel.

My last shovel is a simple plow shovel [like this.](https://gatewaylandscapesupply.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/27in-Snow-Pusher-Shovel-Wolverine1.jpg) It is fast to cleanup shallow snow and slush sitting on the driveway.

If you can afford it, a snowblower is your best friend. I couldn't afford a $1500 gas powered blower so I bought [this one](https://www.amazon.ca/Snow-Joe-SJ623E-18-Inch-Electric/dp/B008FV5R2C). It was $90 when I bought it. Key features are that it is plugged in (way more voltage than a battery will give you), has metal blades, metal gears, is light enough that a child could use it, and runs at literally the max Amps a breaker will sustain. I've had it for 3 years and it still works great. No problem cleaning up after the last storm. I just wish it had a taller mouth with sharper edges to cut into deep snow. You also need a paved driveway to use a snowblower without damaging stuff.",t2_5zpvr,Vok250,0,1643907521.0,0,t1_hvfw5by,hvfw5by,True,Character-Ad-5055,t3_sjnsq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sjnsq5/shovel_recommendations/,Shovel Recommendations,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/sjnsq5/shovel_recommendations/hvfw5by/,7,r/SaintJohnNB,0,7
