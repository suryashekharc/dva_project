"I will also include my answer to a similar question asked in r/kzoo:

I have not spoken much with Alfonso, so I do not want to make direct comparisons. I do believe that fundamentally we have different political philosophies, so I think that as we have further discussions, those differences will appear and you can decide which one aligns with you specifically. 

 
All that I can say is that my political philosophy is based off of the power dynamic in our country. Who has the power, what are they doing with it, and who should have the power? This is because I believe that the more that power is concentrated, the more likely there will be corruption. So, concentrated power must be limited by decentralizing power, or at least by ensuring that those in power are transparent and are held accountable.

 
Currently, those who have power are politicians, the economic elite, and large corporations (all of which overlap with each other). In a perfect world, the people hold power over the politicians and hold them accountable, and then the politicians hold power over corporations (laws/regulations) and hold them accountable to ensure that they are fair to their workers, the environment, and the communities in which they reside.

However, what we see is a vicious cycle of politicians and the economic elite benefitting each other instead of the country as a whole. Corporations and the wealthy donate to politicians, politicians pass legislation that is favorable to their donors, then when politicians retire they get offered jobs by their donors to become lobbyists themselves- thus restarting the cycle. This is done by both political parties.

Then, politicians try to divide us. We are told that immigrants are the problem, people poorer than us are the problem, people of the opposite party are the problem- when the real problem is that neither political party is representing the people. It’s not hyperbole- there was literally a study that was conducted that showed that the opinion of the American people has a “near-zero"" effect on what laws are passed in Washington DC. 

The reality is that regular voters aren’t as different from each other as we think. We all have the common interest  of wanting a decent life for ourselves, our family, our friends, and our neighbors. Corporations have shown that they will do almost anything- offshoring jobs, automation, layoffs, stagnating wages- to maximize their profits at the cost of the American worker. Not to mention the pollution that they cause as long as they can get away with it. 

While corporations don’t care about the well-being of their workers and the community, workers (voters) have a vested interest in the success of both the company that they work for and the community in which they live. 

So, we need a new strategy for a successful America. The power needs to be with the people, because collectively we will want what is best for the ourselves and the country. 

I’ve identified three groups that have the power: corporations, the wealthy, and politicians. Who do we, the people, have power and influence over? Realistically, there is little we can do about Amazon or Jeff Bezos. But we do decide who is elected to office. Then in turn, those who are elected can impose laws and regulations that ensure corporations treat their workers, customers, and community fairly. 

It is not a simple process, and it is not an easy process. I talk to a lot of people who are apathetic about our entire government and electoral system. And they have a right to be. Things haven’t changed dramatically in a way that makes people think that their vote matters. But as long as they believe it, they will be right. We need to vote out corrupt politicians, and vote in politicians who will genuinely represent the people. If they fail to follow through on their promises, vote them out too. 

It is important for a politician to understand the dynamics of power. Not just the dynamics between people, government, and corporations (private sector), but also the dynamics of power within government. I’ve come across politicians who I agree with on certain policies, but they do not wield their power as legislators. They have the ability to block votes, to apply pressure, and so on but they don't. Even of they don’t have the power, they should make a stink about it. For example, if I proposed a bill to cap insulin prices and no one would cosponsor it, or if it stalled in committee, I’d be talking about it everyday and calling out those who are paid off by the pharmaceutical industry. 

I apologize for the long answer. I didn’t want a generic “I’m a good leader"" or anything like that. And to me, actions speak louder than words. Unfortunately, since I’ve never been an elected official, you don’t have actions of mine to look back on. So the least I can do is give meaning behind my words and provide as much detail as possible  which makes it harder to backtrack on, which is what some politicians do when they keep their policies vague.",t2_ks1w9hk4,Glasser4Michigan,0,1647537875.0,0,t1_i11k43v,i11k43v,False,Glasser4Michigan,t3_tfli1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/hollandmichigan/comments/tfli1z/chris_glasser_for_congress/,Chris Glasser for Congress,/r/hollandmichigan/comments/tfli1z/chris_glasser_for_congress/i11k43v/,2,r/hollandmichigan,0,2
"With all due respect, it sounds like your mind is already made up. You have listed Mr. Alfonso's positions, but did not mention any of mine. I address issues of corruption, third parties, workers rights, healthcare, foreign policy, the environment, and other issues. You may disagree with my positions, which is fine, but I am not sure what makes him ""more serious."" But that is a decision for you and the other voters to make.

Mr. Alfonso addresses what I consider to be the most basic issues. I take is as a bare minimum that all politicians support clean air and water, taking care of our veterans, and supporting our farmers. I don't know a single politician who would be against those positions 

The area of farming is probably one of my weak areas, as I am from Kalamazoo. I look forward to hearing more from farmers so I can understand the specific problems that they face. Similarly, I am unfamiliar with the particular issues of those who live in Holland, and I look forward to hearing those views as well.

Who has a ""better odds of winning"" is obviously a debatable topic. I would suspect a race against Huizenga would be different than a race against Upton, who is likely to run. 

Huizenga represents more of the Donald Trump vote (obviously he was endorsed by him) while Upton is the moderate candidate, using traditional terms. In reality, they both have very similar voting records. 

I fundamentally disagree that a moderate Democrat is what will appeal to voters, especially if put against a moderate like Upton. If faced with a moderate Republican and a moderate democrat, I don't see why conservative voters would select the moderate democrat. The Democratic party has tried again and again to run moderate candidates, but I don't see any success. The moderate democrats that are in Confrss also fail to deliver results.

I believe that a economically populist candidate will be more appealing to voters. Voters in the 6th District (again, I can't speak for your current district) heard Trump's calls to drain the swamp of corruption, of bringing jobs back to America, and renewing the American dream. The people felt left behind by the politicians in DC and wanted change. 

Unfortunately, the swamp was not drained. American prosperity as detailed by Donald Trump did not come to fruition. But that is what resonated with voters, and that's who I want to talk to. It is very possible that we are ""targeting"" two different groups. I don't know. I hope to resonate with working class folks who feel left behind. 

Regarding my comments on the Democratic Party. I'm being honest. That's how I feel. I would run as an independent and caucus with the Democrats in Congress if that was feasible. I'm not going to lie to voters or keep my thoughts quiet for political gain. Frankly, I hope it's a positive thing. The majority of Americans aren't happy with the two-party system, even if they vote for those parties. It's a broken system and I think most voters understand that. It's not irredeemable, but it's important to call out the party when necessary and not act like they are always good.

"As I’m sure you know CD4 is republican-favored, if a democrat was going to win it, it would have to be on a series of popular measures to motivate turnout of people who feel disenfranchised, and with significant support of the Michigan Democratic Party. So, the fact that you say you aren’t a fan and you’re only running as a democrat out of necessity makes me a bit concerned about your chances.

Your pitch doesn’t include a lot of what it probably should. One of the bigger issues in Holland at the moment is skyrocketing real-estate prices, increasing the cost of homes and rent. 

The old CD2, including Ottawa county voted Kasich in 2016 republican primary, essentially the only group of counties in the state to have done so. If a Democrat is going to win this district, now CD4, you’re going to win by taking a moderate position against Huizenga and pointing to Huizenga’s support of the trump administration.

Your opponent, Joseph Alfonso, has taken positions supporting family farmers(good, because there are a good number of farmers in the district), immigration reform(good, because at least in Holland we have a large Hispanic population who may be motivated to vote based on immigration reform), reducing pollution, water pollution specifically which is a home-run position that everyone is in favor of(Holland being on 2 lakes), as well as having served in the military and supporting better treatment of Vets.

He seems like a more serious candidate, with better odds of winning, and the main issue that matters to me in the democratic primary is “Who has a better chance of being elected against Huizenga?”

(The Prince family and downtown Holland/ 8th street, DeVos/Cook family and Hope College, Padnos, etc. there are many more) Simultaneously, there are times where the privilege of money flies in the face of everyday people and what may be best for the community (example: south side pier no longer open to the public because of Van Andel mansion. Or the development of high end apartments across the street from homeless shelter during an affordable housing crisis)
It’s a great place to live. Every place has their issues, but there’s a lot of goodness here. I agree with the posts about being deeply religious - there’s a church on every corner. Dutch founding and deep Dutch base of people, being slowly mixed with a more and more Hispanic influence. But those deep religious values are what makes this a great place to live: Safe, clean, hard working, business friendly, and generally people are nice. If you’re looking for places to visit, for sure go down 8th street, DeBoer bakery, The Windmill, farmers market, Hope College’s campus is incredible, The Knickerbocker. 
On thursdays in the Summer there are street performers.

"A few memories/experiences:

Looking both ways when crossing a one way street

That time the Grand Haven 4th of July fireworks lit all the dune grass on fire

Enjoying the beaches in September after the tourists leave

Enjoying the little public beach that most people don’t know about

Many roads have bike paths along them, not just sidewalks, so you can go for a pleasant, long bike ride.

" First, I would say West Michigan shoreline, not east lake Michigan shoreline, Saugatuck is just south of Holland. It's a town dependent on tourist. 4000 residents but housing for 60,000. Something that has been happing along all shorelines is the small cottages being bought up and destroyed to build huge lake homes. 
  We have a growing diversity of people and religion compared to 50 years ago. Our restaurants and bars have become stylish and trendier, the Homesh / farm style and hole in wall bars are being bought and remodeled to draw in the tourist. Driving in Holland is less than great. Most are unaware, distracted or just rude and entitled, then ad tourist to the mess.

"Holland and other cities along the shore (St Joe, Grand Haven, Muskegon, Traverse City) certainly get an influx of tourists during Summer, but they also have a lot of industry that give them a pretty stable population base.  I live about half way between Grand Rapids and Holland, but have worked in Holland most of my career.

If you're looking for more of a pure ""tourist town"", I might suggest looking at Saugatuck, Petoskey, or Ludington

Regardless, though, a few common traits include:

Lake Effect Snow - as long as Lake Michigan doesn't completely freeze over (which is rare) moisture will evaporate from the lake and then dump in bands for about the first 30 miles inland.  And amounts can wildly vary depending on wind direction... Out of the Northeast? Holland is getting blasted while Grand Haven gets nothing.

FIPs - F*€king Illinois People - Along the lakeshore in the summer you'll see almost as many Illinois license plates as Michigan.  Generally if you see a huge home on the beach, it belongs to some rich business person from Chicago (or their descendants... They tend to stay in the family)

Ottawa Beach Road - most of these ""beach towns"" are actually built at the harbor of a river flowing into Lake Michigan.  I'll use Holland as the example here... Holland is built on the shores of Lake Macatawa, where the Black River flows into Lake Michigan.  This means that downtown Holland is actually about a 10 minute drive down Ottawa Beach from the State Park Beach (which turns into a 40 minute stop-and-go nightmare on a nice summer weekend)

Red Flag Day - the beaches use flags to communicate the general safety of the lake on any given day because of waves and undertow.  Generally this is dependent on wind speed and direction.  Local weather teams have even started to incorporate it into the weather report.

The Lake ""Turning"" - I still don't fully understand this one, sometimes it seems wind-driven, other times it just happens out of the blue, but one day Lake Michigan will feel like bath water at 78°, and the next day the lake will turn and the water will be 48°.  I know it has to do with the colder water on the bottom of the lake coming to the surface...

Algae Blooms - Similar to the lake tuning in that they're unpredictable.  I've been fortunate enough to avoid them.

Pier Diving - strongly discouraged by many (technically illegal in most places, though rarely enforced) walking out on the pier and jumping off.  As a former pier diver, there are two major reasons to always jump into the lake side, never the channel side.  1) boat traffic 2) water quality

Festivals - Holland has Tulip Time, Traverse City has Cherry Festival, Grand Haven has Coast Guard Festival.  It's like a rule of being a coastal town.  I avoid them like the plague (except for the fireworks at Coast Guard... Those are worth the crowds)

I think I've done all the damage I can think of for now... Let me know if you have any follow up questions, I only lived IN Holland for a couple years, but I've lived a couple towns over with Holland as my favored beach my whole life.",t2_iu3cdli,hazmatt89,0,1647086125.0,0,t1_i0cytia,i0cytia,True,literarytoast,t3_tc3aeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/hollandmichigan/comments/tc3aeg/writing_a_novel_looking_for_inspiration/,"Writing A Novel, Looking for Inspiration",/r/hollandmichigan/comments/tc3aeg/writing_a_novel_looking_for_inspiration/i0cytia/,4,r/hollandmichigan,0,4

"The area was very religious 25+ years ago.  Lots of Reformed churches.  Practically nothing open on Sundays.  Could not buy alcohol in the county on Sundays.  Which really killed the bars on Super Bowl Sunday.  Had a boss who sold me a used car on Sunday.  He panicked and changed the date of sale to Saturday.

Most professionals living here, did not grow up here.  Things have loosened up.  The Blue Sunday law was repealed. Pre-pandemic bar life was hopping.

There's a decent amount of car nuts in town.  I feel like I see a parking lot full of collectors every other weekend in the summer.

The beaches, parks and bike paths are great.

Tulip Time is a double edge sword.  It's cool living somewhere people vacation.  It must be nice here then.  Working downtown during Tulip Time means unbearable traffic for a couple weeks.  Lunch is either a brown bag or a grease wagon because driving anywhere means losing your parking spot. Most work stops during a parade since employees are plastered in the windows watching.  I've had my kids in the parade.  They have to wear official costumes and there's a used clothing sale day where parents can sell old or buy new ones.  The dancers also need to wear wooden shoes, which they wear many layers of socks as padding.

Hispanic population is growing.  Gives a lot of Mexican restaurant options.

"Personally I feel living in a tourist town is more annoying than advantageous, that's coming from somebody who likes to ride my motorcycle around in the warmer months. Often I'll find myself going down lakeshore drive constantly being cut off by out of staters who forget to use a turn signal and are consistently lost looking for their Air-bnb or just going for a drive for the sake of it. Traffic around Holland in the summer is really dangerous, it's not a fun place to be when you're on a bike. Most of the time I end up waiting til 11 or 12pm to go for a ride during the middle of the summer because it's the only safe time to be out riding.

"Agree with AmbitiousHornet on all those locations and I'll give James St Inn another huge upvote.  Decor is a little dated, but the food is great.

If you enjoy beer, stop by Brewery 4Two4.  It's a bit away from the ""main drag"" of Holland and not as famous as New Holland Brewery, but they brew some great stuff.  While they don't serve food, Sluggo's is right next door with great pizza and sandwiches and they'll bring your order over when it's ready.

"If I'm honest everything about Holland is great if you're looking to settle down, if however you're looking for more of an upbeat and youthful place you should look further east towards grand rapids. About the same with jobs, Holland has a lot of jobs for manufacturing, restaurants, hospitality, medical, services, tradesman, automotive, but it's seriously lacking professional business jobs in areas like marketing, legal, finance, computer technical work, etc. It's just not a city dwelling and those areas are very sparse. More people are leaving places like GR to move here for a better home-life and community and still commute into GR for work, with that we've seen record high prices on homes. A little shack in downtown Holland will set you back about $300k plus an additional 10% income tax for city taxes. If you were thinking of moving here look to the northside of Lake Mac, taxes are lower, neighborhoods are more spread out with more acreage per person, and you might actually get your moneys worth out of a home. If you're lookin to rent here for a reasonable rate you're mistaken really, $1400/month for a 2 bed 2 bath and nothing included for a decent apartment with no garage and just one assigned parking spot. Then again, that's cheaper than Grand Rapids rent so take that as you may.

"There are SO many jobs! Lots of factory jobs that provide livable wages & good bonuses & benefits. (Gentex, MillerKnoll) Also jobs available at pretty much every store & restaurant. We do have several distilleries, even some with restaurants attached. 

Holland has a large Mexican population too & by extension, lots of Mexican stores & restaurants! They have a really strong community here. l feel like so many people in Holland know Spanish- whether they're Mexican or not- it's very neat. Like... A LOT of young children are in Spanish immersion programs. Holland has lots of cultural diversity. 

The amount of scenic trails, staircases, parks, etc, is pretty much all you could ask for. Even in the winter, downtown Holland is always an option for running, since the sidewalks are heated & always clear of snow! We have TONS of creeks, ponds, lakes, & of course Lake Michigan, all good for summer adventures & fishing. Also, our Farmer's Market is awesome. 

I've lived here all my life & have zero desire to leave. Holland is seriously the best. & so beautiful!

"We have a really rad climbing gym in town, Scrapyard Collective, and a nice little community. It's mostly bouldering, but also some ropes. There's a Tension Board if that's up your alley.

There's 150 miles of paved bike/walk trails in Holland, that are mostly off the road, not a shoulder. I can leave my house and ride to Saugatuck, or Grand Haven and I'm on paths 99% of the time. I actually feel safe.

Ottawa County has an incredible park system, ranging from places you can watch the sunset, to river hikes, to just open space. There are MTB trails in town, Riley Park even just started getting groomed in the winter.

If you XC ski, Pigeon Creek is one of the best parks in the state, and has miles of trails, groomed and ungroomed, and the groomed are lit til 10pm. MTB/hiking in the summer. Speaking of ski.. we get a lot of lake effect snow. For weeks we may get an inch or 4 per night.

There's not a ton of camping within 30 minutes or even an hour (i mean i dont count holland SP), but just beyond that you have tons of choices. You can disperesed camp just about anywhere on State or Federal forest land in our state, so you guys would probably love disappearing to Manistee National Forest for a weekend.

You'd probably love it here. There's a distillery in town, even. The economy is growing, and booming. It's going to continue growing IMO for a while. A lot of the economy is driven by work nearby in Zeeland or whatever but, it's basically one big economic engine.

People in Holland are friendly and generally lean conservative. Most people are Christian. Night life is really nonexistent, but you can go to Grand Rapids or even Saugatuck if you want to really ""go out"". There's an assortment of restaurants because it's a tourist town, and our downtown areas sidewalks and roads are heated.

The Dutch are.. the dutch.

"The first amendment provides citizens the right to freedom of expression and freedom of religion without government interference. This does not extend to private institutions. Hope college falls under a private institution. They are allowed to punish people (ie expel students who don't abide by their rules). So while you can say (not saying you should, but you certainly have the right to) ""The US president is an N-word"" and not risk being jailed/fined/punished by the government for saying as much. But your job, college, grocery store, or any other private institution can say you can not work there, attend, shop there etc. because they are not the government. They are private operations and get to make their own rules and standards. So it was well within Hope College's abilities to take action against racist remarks.


There are limits to ""free speech"" that one can expect to get away with.

"Idk why y’all treat my answer with sarcasm, when the question was whether I wa treated with racism. Is that something that’s common here? Oh yeah, it is. Because y’all’s town is literally 40% latino(a)(x) and yet why doesn’t that population hang out downtown? Do they feel uncomfortable? Because I’m pretty sure they do. 

Y’all are about to accuse me of being racist, which ex-hope kid here. Why was it allowed that multiple students of color were racially harassed by white students? They were literally called the “N-word,” so I guess Hope doesn’t describe your town, then what does?
Why did this happen, amongst students who were from Michigan? 
Why was it that the school did fuck all to make amends? 
It’s not entirely y’all, but y’all do nothing to help. Why do y’all let this happen? Isn’t the school like 40% of y’all’s support financially? And if not, why wouldn’t y’all let students know this school was racist and bigoted?

Allow me to have my opinion about the town y’all live in. I’m not calling you racist, I’m just saying y’all’s town **IS** racist.

""As a former Hope student.""  Are you still living here?  Why call out a whole town you haven't lived in for years, now?

Why is Holland so much worse than any other typical town.  Racists live everywhere.  Again, examples help.

The only example you mention is how many whites live downtown.  Existing doesn't make someone racist.  Many cities have segregation problems.

Overall in Holland, 66.2% is white

Age 65 and over is more than 90% white.

"Taken aback by your post honestly, never found a more inclusive and loving community as Holland in the entire state. Perhaps this is an internal bias reading by you? I'd really like to pick your brain on what exactly made you believe that Holland as an entire city is ""racist"". Is it the majority republican voting base? The socio-economic disparity between peoples skin colors throughout the city? As somebody who has ties and friends within the communities of color around the city I've never heard any of them say the city or its people are ""racist"". Sure there's some senile old men and women still roaming around downtown who have kept their opinions from 65+ years ago, but if you're really basing your accusation on what some old people do or say I think you might be overanalyzing the actions of few and assuming it as a general problem.

"Define safe- all driving is risky. Winter driving raises your risks in the following ways:

Lack of traction due to snow, slush or ice on the roads. This affects your ability to stop, steer, avoid problems. You have to accelerate and stop at slower rates, meaning it’ll take you longer to come to a stop. If you hit the brakes hard you will likely lose control and slide off the road or hit someone/something. 

A safe speed of travel is dependent on the road conditions- Ice is worst, you can lose control at any speed. Slush is bad also. Snow when the temp is sufficiently below freezing is the best of the three. Highly dependent on your tires and how well they handle Cold temps and snow. 

Second major risk factor is visibility. That’s your biggest problem this week. When it’s cold, the wind is blowing, snow is loose and still falling- you are likely to have reduced visibility and potentially “white out” conditions. That’s where you can hardly see in front of you, similar to a REALLY bad fog. 

Third- if you do go into the ditch or have mechanical issues with your car. It can be very dangerous due to the cold temps or someone else hitting you. You always want to have a lot of gas in your tank, a blanket, warm clothes and a way to contact emergency services. 

Long story short- I’d only risk the trip if you had good tires, were confident in your winter driving skills, drove very cautiously and acknowledge that you could get injured or die driving there or back.",t2_7reus,wiredsim,0,1641488726.0,0,t1_hrihi0e,hrihi0e,True,glo-fi,t3_rxi952,https://www.reddit.com/r/hollandmichigan/comments/rxi952/is_it_safe_to_drive_from_chicago_to_holland_in/,Is it safe to drive from Chicago to Holland in this weather?,/r/hollandmichigan/comments/rxi952/is_it_safe_to_drive_from_chicago_to_holland_in/hrihi0e/,8,r/hollandmichigan,0,8

"Welcome to Holland!

Holland and Zeeland both have decent adult recreation sports leagues/programs.  For softball at least, you can sign up as a ""free agent"" in either and they'll set you up with a team.

"It's a biodigester. Basically a big tank to holds the towns poo's so bacteria can eat them up. The bacteria make lots of natural gas while doing this, that is capture and concentrate, then piped over to the power plant to generate electricity. Holland is basically lighting our farts to keep the lights on, and it's a great idea.

"I’m giving you an upvote because I appreciate your concern for our veterans and for those Americans still abroad and at risk. I would also like to humbly suggest to you that it is possible to do both, in the same way that I can spend my grocery money on vegetables *and* meat, or love *both* my kids.

I’m a Desert Storm vet (1st ID), I’m a long-time supporter of the Wounded Warrior Project and of Homes for Our Troops, and I’m deeply interested in mental health care for veterans that can meet some of our fairly unique needs. I *also* believe that those who have been legally granted asylum / refugee status in the US deserve our empathy, our respect, and our aid (particularly in light of some of what I saw in Iraq and Kuwait, even though it was many moons ago).

Finally I’m a proponent of small government, and so it makes me happy to see efforts like this being at least partially funded in this way - so private citizens like you and me have the opportunity to *choose* what to support financially, as opposed to watching our tax dollars be arbitrarily redistributed by bureaucrats whose passions and sympathies may lie far from our own.

My house is isolated enough that displaying a sign wouldn’t be particularly meaningful - but I’ll enjoy wearing the shirt that I just ordered once it arrives.

"Thank YOU for your service! We appreciate your willingness to service this great country!

I consider Holland, the largest city in Ottawa County, to be great. I'm not Hispanic, but consider it to be diverse, not only with nationalities but culturally, environmentally (however without great differences in altitude) and opportunities as well. Being adjacent to Kent County, where Grand Rapids and it's suburbs are, it provides an even greater level of diversity, just a short distance away.

Holland has a great downtown. https://www.downtownholland.com One of the best in America. And there are many other great communities to explore throughout Michigan. Holland, Grand Rapids and all of West Michigan are well known for their brewing industry. Lots of good places to enjoy a beverage and great food.

Ottawa Country is the State's fastest growing county. Job potential is high. https://www.westmiworks.org

I'm curious why you chose Holland? Do you have family in the area? If so are you looking to validate what they have said?

Have you heard about the snow? Please know it is well managed. Snowmelt system in downtown Holland is amazing. We can get a lot of snow. Generally over a day or two. Again, well managed. Rarely do multiple snow systems perpetuate into one big snow storm. But it has happened in recent years. Make sure you have good tires on your vehicle. There is a bus system as well, ""Routes & Schedules - Max transportation"" https://catchamax.org/routes-schedules/

Thankfully the snow gives way to the other great seasons here! So many great beaches! And such a great lake in Lake Michigan! Lot of other inland lakes as well!

"In some sense I can see where you are coming from. World leaders and those in power will indeed capitalize on a crisis for profit. Pfizer is undoubtedly guilty of this in the Covid pandemic for example, in trying to protect their patent rights and thus preventing third world countries from being able to develop their vaccine. But it's not that the crisis isn't real, or not as bad as people claim. Once again, I encourage you to really consider that this is a global issue. Your skepticism of ""the left's"" claims, I assume, is of the U.S left. But what I was trying to emphasize in my previous comments is that in many other countries this is not a left-right issue to the same degree, and in many countries not a left-right issue at all.

To be sure, there are some countries like Brazil where Covid has been politicized like in the U.S. But there are many countries worldwide that had right-wing governments when the pandemic hit who put in place much stricter measures then anything in the U.S. So it's not just the left that takes covid seriously, internationally, in other comparable countries to the U.S, both the left and the right have taken the pandemic seriously, and advocated for restrictions. Not a left-right issue unless you just focus on U.S politics.

You are very right to be angry about the influence of greed in our worldwide political and economic system though.",t2_dm8908zi,talltree818,0,1634579599.0,0,t1_hh4um22,hh4um22,False,Puzzleheaded-Bad-570,t3_pzqgdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/hollandmichigan/comments/pzqgdn/cant_wait_for_this_rolls_eyes_hard/,Can't wait for this... *rolls eyes hard*,/r/hollandmichigan/comments/pzqgdn/cant_wait_for_this_rolls_eyes_hard/hh4um22/,1,r/hollandmichigan,0,1

"How is it though that all governments have coordinated this conspiracy you seem to suggest? If Covid was fake, not nearly as bad as suggested, or whatever you believe, then all governments in the world would have to be in on it. The United States would have to be working with China and Russia to perpetuate the conspiracy.

"Yup. The current tower placement was designed to provide good coverage with 3G signals. 4G and 5G don't travel as far and have much worse building peneration, and all of the major carriers are discontinuing their 3g networks to provide more 5g bandwidth, leaving huge gaps in service, especially inside and in areas that previously had weak signals. They are installing smaller 5G transmitters to try to cover some of those areas, but these are naturally being added in major metropolitan areas first, so smaller cities like Holland, and elsewhere are screwed, plus since most of us don't have actual 5G phones we just get shitty service no matter where we are. (Note: [AT&T lies about phones being on 5G service with the 5Ge tag](https://telecoms.com/504477/national-advertising-review-board-finally-tells-att-to-stop-lying-about-5g/), which is just slightly faster 4G, so even if you see 5G occasionally, this may still be 4G service).",t2_er936,AgonizingFury,0,1633901846.0,0,t1_hg5jkzo,hg5jkzo,True,ponybau5,t3_q5byv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hollandmichigan/comments/q5byv9/anyone_else_getting_terrible_cell_service_in_most/,Anyone else getting TERRIBLE cell service in most of Holland lately?,/r/hollandmichigan/comments/q5byv9/anyone_else_getting_terrible_cell_service_in_most/hg5jkzo/,4,r/hollandmichigan,0,4

">And don't get me started on breakthroughs, because the vaccine works except when it doesn't.

Do you believe that it's  possible for something to work often, but not always? If you are willing to admit that logical possibility then  you would have to concede your own argument here is invalid as an argument against vaccination (if that's why you made your comment). For example, not smoking won't for sure prevent me from getting lung cancer. So what's the point, why not light one up by your reasoning? Wearing a seatbelt will not for sure prevent me from dying in a car crash. By your logic, I just should not wear a seatbelt.

"The wife and I were just updating the places we want to go for breakfast as well, and I removed DeBoar from our list because it doesn't appear from their website that they serve food (beyond the obvious bakery options, which are awesome, but not ""date"" food) on the North side anymore. Their website lists hours for the restaurant on the North side, but no menu. The south side has a menu, but it's far too limited to be considered for breakfast, especially with Jackie's blocks away. If they still serve breakfast there, and it's more than the 5 very limited options available on the South side, it would be great if they published the menu somewhere.

Edit: And just in case anyone wants some of my list, every place listed so far in this thread is pretty good. Some of the places I haven't seen here yet that I've been to: Vee's (Zeeland, not fancy but FAST), Community (Zeeland, New owners, better and usually not very crowded), James St. Inn (Holland, great portions for the price), Rainbow Grill (Hudsonville, right off I-196, so not too far.

And two we still need to try: South Side Inn (Holland, let me know, we haven't been yet), Kitchen Zero (Holland, looks overly fancy and over-priced, but if that's your thing...)

"Oh I agree that is a major struggle. But the main reason is because all land in this area has gone up in value and nobody wants to sell their property at a low enough cost to justify low income housing that inherently makes less money. 

That Property is owned by the city- that’s the main reason it is happening at all and with the cooperation of a non-profit developing it. 

We have to Face reality, Holland is not a low income/affordable area anymore. People are moving here from all over the country and the real estate market is in high demand.

If there is a plot of land with cheap housing that isn’t generating enough revenue, it will get torn down and replaced with something more profitable. 

I suspect if you were a landowner in the Holland area you wouldn’t want to sell it for far less than what you could get just so cheap housing could be built. Plus the cost for builders and materials is so high.

"OK, and now that you know the pictures aren't really anything special, what is your concern with that? There are plenty of irritating hobbies out there, possibly some you participate in. What if they banned your favorite hobby because someone was unreasonably irritated by it?

To be clear, I'm not a drone flyer, but a rights activist, and I'll be the first to agree that some drone pilots need to be more aware of how their flight might impact others, but in order for ""someone's dumb hobby"" to infringe on someone else's rights, that person must have a right that is being infringed. People at the beach have no right not to be filmed that can be infringed. If you disagree, feel free to point out which constitutional amendment you think grants them that right, and I'll be happy to point out why you are wrong. Any person can walk right up to anyone at a public beach with their phone camera or even a telephoto lens, and take pictures of anyone at the beach they want to, and there is nothing that can be legally done about it. Photography is considered art, and art is considered speech, so the 1st amendment protects everyone's right to film or take pictures in public.

"Ok well I’m glad they tried. If you wanna fly your drone over a beach then but private property on the beach. Someone’s dumb hobby doesn’t get to infringe on others.

"While I agree that drones at the beach can feel creepy, 99.9% of  drones out there have cameras that are designed for wide angle scenery shots, so they are not taking up close photos of the ladies in their bikinis, nor do they have the capability of doing so. It would take quite the setup to use a telephoto lens on a drone. Drones are not stable enough for telephoto shots, so in addition to having to have enough power to carry an extra heavy camera, it would also require an advanced 3 axis gimbal stabilizer so small movements of the drone wouldn't impact the shot. Any drone capable of doing that would look like WWMT's Sky Eye 3, and would be extremely obvious. Secondly, we have rights in this country (that I fought for in the military) and Ottawa County doesn't just get to pass random laws that violate those in their attempts to prevent problems that don't exist. Both Federal and State laws set out what a locality can and cannot ban with regards to drones, and there is a Michigan law that preempts all localities from restricting drone usage any further than the state and federal laws do, so this ordinance literally violates that state law; The Michigan unmanned aircraft systems act:

>Sec. 5. (1) Except as expressly authorized by statute, a political subdivision shall not enact or enforce an ordinance or resolution that regulates the ownership or operation of unmanned aircraft or otherwise engage in the regulation of the ownership or operation of unmanned aircraft.

The Michigan Supreme court has ruled several times against other localities that have attempted similar bans. The US Supreme Court has ruled time and time again that we have no expectation of privacy in public places. If you don't want someone taking wide angled pictures/video of you at the beach, buy property with a private beach or don't go to the beach. While I understand the negative impact this can have on people who value their privacy, it is an important precedent for accountability. Without it, the press may not be able to film matters of public interest without worrying about being arrested under the guise of various privacy violations by public officials who just don't want their corruption exposed.

Additionally, this ordinance attempts to restrict our right to disclose what public officials do while working for the taxpayer on the taxpayer's dime. It specifically outlaws taking pictures of any public official's desk, under the guise of privacy for those whose paperwork the public official is processing, but it's really just to hide that they waste half their day collecting big taxpayer funded paychecks doing next to nothing, and they don't want that exposed. Again, the US Supreme Court has ruled that public officials have no expectation of privacy in their public duties, and that what they do while performing their duties is of public interest and can be filmed. If Ottawa County officials were really that worried about privacy they could easily process confidential paperwork in non-public areas. Also, while there are certainly some issues of confidentiality, the majority of what is being processed at County offices is public record and can be requested via public records laws, so being videotaped is of no consequence anyway.

Even under the best light, this is a showboat ordinance; one that they know will fail upper court scrutiny, but still allows them to claim ""they tried, and did everything they could"" while wasting taxpayer dollars defending it, and paying out of taxpayer coffers for the rights violations lawsuits that result. I would much rather have the law enforcement, and legal budget of the county used to prosecute actual child molesters and criminals, rather than having it wasted on political showboating, wouldn't you?",t2_er936,AgonizingFury,0,1628431759.0,0,t1_h865l9d,h865l9d,False,AgonizingFury,t3_p04e3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/hollandmichigan/comments/p04e3v/drive_a_tesla_or_take_a_picture_of_your_own_child/,Drive a Tesla or take a picture of your own child enjoying an Ottawa County park after September 1st: Spend 90 days in jail and/or pay a $500 fine.,/r/hollandmichigan/comments/p04e3v/drive_a_tesla_or_take_a_picture_of_your_own_child/h865l9d/,1,r/hollandmichigan,0,1

"Just last year vaccine passports were laughed at as a conspiracy theory. Now they are a reality and are being justified by being equivocated to drivers licenses and vaccines you get when you're a kid. 

Equivocation. It's a logical fallacy, many on the left LOVE to point those out.  


There couldn't possibly be more nuances to the situation with covid and the covid vaccine to make the comparison totally null, right? Is the severity of covid that of the mumps? Or measles? Or whopping cough? Is it really that unreasonable to be hesitant about a vaccine that was completely rushed and doesn't yet have FDA approval? 

The comparison in your mind is not causing you to blindly give in and even be a force for slowly inching us to authoritarianism, right? 

Guess what? I AM immunocompromised! I take immunsopressant drugs to be able to LIVE.  And I GOT covid and lost my taste and smell. For about a week and it was back. I'm being used as fodder for authoritarians to convince you that vaccine passports are just totally fine and we should accept them because people who are against them are basically Neanderthals who don't know what's good for them. 

My nephrologist literally told me that my hesitancy for the vaccine was 100% justified and that since I've already had the virus, it would be ok for me to wait for more of a long term idea of what the effects of the vaccine are. One of the best nephrologists in the state.

And lets say you are asymptomatic and go somewhere that doesn't require a passport.

And his decision, he says, is ""a very private matter"" for him. Apparently he never said anything bad about vaccines. But now the hospital has severed ties with him?

And the hospital wants to keep their stance on the vaccine ""unequivocal"", but the only way he contradicted that is his personal decision not to get it. 


Does anyone actuslly read the articles people post and actually think about it? Do they think cousins said ""vaccine bad""? Cause he didn't. 

The media is only dividing us. The hysteria about unvaccinated people is making people dehumanize those who don't get the vaccine.

Hog Wild BBQ is the best BBQ in town if she is a fan of delicious flavor. I recommend the pulled pork, roasted half chicken, brisket sandwich or the sandwich of the month.

Bowerman's blueberry farm is amazing (I see you have Reender's, I'm just partial to Bowerman's). Their donuts are soft and sweet and they have pies, jams, sauces, salsas, and other sweets.

DeBoer Bakkerij is famous for phenomenal breakfast. 

Bass River Recreation Area is about 20 minutes from North Holland and has great hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding.

Captain Sundae on Douglas Avenue is the original, and it is the best of all three in my opinion. That one is seasonal, though. 

Craig's Cruisers is a fun time with go-karts, mini golf and more.

Crane's in the City is great for lunch!! It's in downtown Holland on 8th street, and they have great sandwiches (I recommend the Ham, Swiss and Pesto panini) but they also have apple cider donuts, pies, and crumbles.

Taqueria Arandas is a great Mexican place. It is very authentic and great portions for the prices. They LOAD the nachos with meat!

"Maybe you didn’t include it because it’s obvious, but you missed the most important celebration of all, Tulip Time! That’s in the beginning of May. If your friend is interested, Dutch dancers begin practicing in February-March and they are always looking for dancers. Last year they didn’t have nearly the same amount of dancers due to covid but hopefully this coming year will be more normal. Just something to look into, it would be a great way to meet people. 

Also for nature, add in Hemlock Crossing and Pigeon Creek. My two favorites for their lengths and variety of scenery. They have 15ish miles of dirt trails combined. Pigeon creek also has bike and horse trails. Hemlock has a kayak launch into the Pigeon River which feeds into Lake Michigan. In the winter you can XC ski at both, Pigeon rents skis. 

Also there are TONS of disc golf courses in the area which are worth trying out imo, it’s a cheap sport to play (you really only need a disc or two) and it’s a great way to get outside and move.

This is an archived version of a Vox article with 5 premises of critical race theory.  A couple of them refure themselves. Marxism is explicitly mentioned.

"I don't want to get into socialism debate exactly for this reason - I know I can't convince you that there's a difference between socialism and failed socialist states. That being said... Do you even know how many European countries are *successful* socialist states? Because there are quite a few.

I really don't think you understand what CRT is. Critical race theory just says that race is a social construct (it is), and that racism is present in our system. I don't understand how this is Marxist, though I also don't understand how Marxism (as a theory, not in practice) is a bad thing.

I understand feeling like the country is being divided. But the difference here is that once this goes away, once everyone is vaccinated, that division goes away too. This isn't something that's ingrained in our society.

But just like I said to our troll friend, why are we not doing whatever we can to eliminate ANY risk of death? I understand the risk is low. But why not make a *slight effort* - that's the thing, too, it's not even that inconvenient to prevent - to make that risk zero? We should be pushing that on all fronts, too, but this is the one we should be focused on right now.",t2_11expf,SoniKzone,0,1628037676.0,0,t1_h7mdabu,h7mdabu,False,[deleted],t3_owq36l,https://www.reddit.com/r/hollandmichigan/comments/owq36l/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/hollandmichigan/comments/owq36l/deleted_by_user/h7mdabu/,2,r/hollandmichigan,0,2
"I'm not sure what to say here,  you don't want to discuss whether Socialism is good or bad? Anywhere where socialist policies have been implemented, hunger, violence, oppression follow. Socialism necessarily leads to communism. No,  we're not exactly socialist right now but we are heading there culturally. Critical race theory is overtly Marxist. And it's in THOUSANDS of public schools. Those who subscribe to the theory typically don't mention that because the public at large doesn't have a favorable view of marxism. Typically the only honest critical race theorists are the academics who explicitly say it has Marxist roots. 

The difference between requiring vaccination cards to get into any public place and requiring vaccinations to be in school is stark. Where do I start? 

1. Typically the vaccinations required for school have been around long enough to know that there aren't dangerous long term side effects. No one knows how long this vaccine will last as a deterrent, no one knows how long you have natural immunity. Some studies are saying a long time!
2. The illnesses that are vaccinated against are typically much, much more severe than covid19. I would compare it to a flu shot. To my knowledge, schools don't really require a flu shot for students. I myself am immunocompromised and I get a flu shot every year, but for most people it's not really necessary and the effectiveness of the vaccine varies anyway. The flu is also a coronavirus, mutates just as much. 

I've had covid. I'm immunocompromised. All that happened to me was I lost my taste and smell, and I got it back in like 2 weeks and I was fine. 

Despite the over used comparison, for all intents and purposes covid is just another type of flu. It is now endemic, nothing is going to change that. 

3. We don't require people to have a flu vaccine to enter public places. The flu is almost just as likely to kill someone like me as covid is. Its been around forever. 

4. What you just said about having ""so many selfish people in the world"" so these measures are not unreasonable smacks of authoritarian. Selfish according to whom? As long as you're in charge, you get to pick who the selfish are. The first comment in this thread is ""i wish people would just get vaccinated so we could stop all this"". Is that not a selfish attitude? They aren't really bemoaning the fact that people are unvaccinated, their problem is with the authoritarian rules that are being laid down, and they're the reason that the powers that be SAY they make those rules. 



Vaccinated people can still spread the virus. Why on earth would it matter if only vaccinated people can go out in public if presumably the vaccinated don't live separately from the unvaccinated? They'll interact with them in some other spaces, right? But i guess maybe we will be separated soon as possibly indicated by bidens rhetoric of ""the unvaccinated community"". They're trying to divide us. They're otherizing people who dont get the vaccine. And it's working.",t2_mxt8rbv,lakedewrisk,0,1628036432.0,0,t1_h7marv2,h7marv2,False,[deleted],t3_owq36l,https://www.reddit.com/r/hollandmichigan/comments/owq36l/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/hollandmichigan/comments/owq36l/deleted_by_user/h7marv2/,1,r/hollandmichigan,0,1
"Okay so you *are* here to make actual conversation. Thank God. Yes the other guy was a troll, I've dealt with him since before the pandemic, but there are now people out there that actually think that way, so it worries me as well.

Socialism itself is not bad but I won't get into that with you - it sounds like we probably just have a fundamental difference in our world views. That being said our country is quite far from actual socialism.

That being said, requiring proof of vaccination is not the end of the world and it's not even anything new. You can't go to school if you haven't had a certain cocktail of vaccines, I believe hepatitis is among them? The difference is, that's been the norm for YEARS. So past grade school, nobody has to ask you about it - it's reasonable to assume you've had it if you've gotten an education.

I wouldn't call myself ideologically possessed. I understand the sentiment behind feeling oppressed by the government pushing a vaccine. But we have so many selfish people in the world that we can't just trust people to get it, AND as I mentioned before, this isn't something that just affects you.

""Heavy-duty vehicles comprise only about 5 percent of all vehicles on the road, yet they generate more than 25 percent of global warming emissions that come from the transportation sector, and significant amounts of air pollution. As the United States moves more and more freight each year, the challenge of reducing emissions from this sector will continue to grow.  
  
Addressing heavy-duty vehicle pollution is critical for improving air quality and reducing global warming emissions in communities around the country. Continuing to lower emissions from fossil fuel–powered trucks is an important first step""

"Who wears a mask anymore besides people that have been ""broken"" by the government?

People who wear them and are now scared of every boogeyman the news generates to drum up ratings with no Trump to scare everyone with.

Or they wear them to prove they haven't and won't take the vaccine because it was developed under Trump and don't trust it.

Or because it was developed by Bill Gates himself to shoot nano-technology into everyone and genetically alter them.

The government has broken all those people, and it appears, they have broken you.

"Do you know how vaccines actually work? Like, do you truly, honestly know what their purpose is? It's not just this almighty injection of ""U Can't Touch This"". It makes you resistant to the virus.

Look at this science - 

More than 163 million Americans are fully vaccinated.  
Of those 163 million who are fully vaccinated, only 6,239 have been hospitalized with the China Flu.

Of the vaccinated who have been seriously ill or died, 74 percent are over 65.  
Among the vaccinated, only 1 out of 26,125 have gotten seriously ill.  
Among the vaccinated, only 1 in 129,000 have died.  
Do you have any idea how small those numbers are? Imagine how small they are for those under 65.  
For context, as far as living with risk, your chances of dying in a car accident this year are 1 in 8400.
