"As someone looking in from the outside:

* There is so much square footage of space and buildings in uptown that really are not needed in a modern economy. Especially in a city of 40,000 people. 
* Modern cities need more of a population base to be ""Lively"". 100 years ago, a city of 40,000 was considered pretty big, but now a city of 40,000 is considered a small town. 
* It takes a lot of time and special talent to re-think historic spaces. It is being done, but it just takes time. 
* Landowners might be holding back. I don't know the makeup of the landowners in uptown, but maybe they don't have the time or resources, or vision to make something happen. Sometimes a generation needs to move on to allow the next generation room to re-imagine the space. 
* Butte is growing. And there are some signs of it. I have seen some spaces on Zillow that are really upscale and beautiful in uptown. It's happening. It just takes time. 

This could be wild thinking, but I think if a high end ski resort was built closer to the city, things would perk up really fast.",t2_h3oyjkw,markpemble,0,1647816082.0,0,t1_i1glnis,i1glnis,True,OnlyPanz,t3_t9vix8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Butte/comments/t9vix8/is_butte_growing/,Is Butte growing?,/r/Butte/comments/t9vix8/is_butte_growing/i1glnis/,1,r/Butte,0,1

Another commenter mentioned a lot of fighting at the schools when he/she was younger, and I do remember that from when I was younger, too.  However, I don't really hear my kids talking about that being a regular thing anymore.  Maybe they just don't see it, but it doesn't seem to be as prevalent as it once was.  Also, the bullying issue, my kids all three went to the same grade school and it never seemed to be much of an issue there either.

"I would say yes - I haven't been in that particular situation, but I think it would be better than most other places.

I really appreciate the education I got in public schools in Butte in the 90s/early 2000s.  I don't know how representative that was of how it is now, but I had some excellent teachers.  Not all, but some.  It seems to me, in retrospect, more reading/writing/'rithmatic focused than schools in most places.  And by middle school, they already had graduated math and English classes, so students who were able to take on more could be challenged, and students who needed more help could get it.  I'm not sure to what degree that's available, or even allowed, in public schools in a lot of places.

Butte also has a certain urban nature to it that you don't get in a lot of parts of the West with urban sprawl.  As a kid, I could ride my bike to a half dozen friends' houses in just a couple minutes, which you just can't do in suburbia where there are half-acre or 1-acre lots and winding streets.  So many kids these days see friends in person only when mommy drives them a few miles for a visit - I didn't have that situation, because we all rode our bikes to school or walked, and walked home together, played in empty lots, were supposed to go home in the summer when the sirens sounded at 9pm or when mom called your name out the back door - real mid-century stuff.

The upsides and downsides are both mostly cultural.  For the downsides, I do remember a lot of fighting and a lot of drinking among kids.  I remember there being over 60 fist fights at East Middle School before Christmas one year I was there, sometimes even with parents getting involved in the fight.  I remember seeing middle school kids drinking on the bus. In grade school, it was all bullying all the time (at least for boys), and lots of anti-intellectualism, which hampered everybody's education, but didn't prevent it - if you were smart and good at sports, everything was ok. That stuff doesn't apply to everybody, but it does create a risk factor for some kids.  It really depends on your kid(s) and how well they're able to navigate that social environment.

Cost wise, there's going to be a huge range as far as housing, but obviously there are some tiny houses that would be very cheap but need a *lot* of work.  I've always thought it would be fun to restore one of those mining company houses that's in its original location (tons of them were up and moved down to the flat parts of town in the 1950s/60s), but that could mean a *lot* of work.",t2_7b7im,HungryLikeTheWolf99,0,1646250175.0,0,t1_hz38dpy,hz38dpy,True,Sonicdonkey466,t3_t56auc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Butte/comments/t56auc/is_butte_a_good_city_for_a_single_income_young/,Is Butte a good city for a single income young family?,/r/Butte/comments/t56auc/is_butte_a_good_city_for_a_single_income_young/hz38dpy/,3,r/Butte,0,3

producers in the USA of copper, molybdenum, and

"I’m a graduate student at Tech right now! I’m in the last semester of my master’s degree and I’m very glad I chose Tech. The school is small, but I’ve gotten to work very closely with my advisor which has made the whole process much less stressful. The other students in my research group are also very supportive and friendly. Because of tech I’ve had opportunities to meet so many new people (friends and professionals) that I would never had otherwise. The only real downside to tech that I can think of is that there are not a lot of TA/RA positions available and they do not pay enough to live off of.

"I'm biased, but I think Montana Tech is one of, if not the, best university in the state.  I got my undergrad there and then did grad school in Missoula.  At Tech the class sizes are small, the placement rate is at or near 100% for nearly every program, and the facilities are top notch.  They have invested a significant amount of money since I went to school there in new labs and other facilities.  In Missoula, I felt like I was just another face in the crowd, whereas at Tech you really do get one on one attention from your professors.

As far as Butte goes, the biggest complaint is that there aren't a lot of things to do for entertainment.  However, if you are at all into the outdoors, Butte has a little of everything.  Skiing, mountain biking, hiking, fishing, rock climbing.  You name it, you've got access to it within a short drive of Butte.

"My wife and I are both “from” butte. She’s a vet. If you want we can chat about Butte, but as a vet I’ll tell you that people in butte(or Montana for that matter) don’t like to pay for vet care. On top of that and generally having to charge less for services you will have a hard time making a living. COL is cheap but rising.  If you’re  ProSal make sure your base is as high as you can possibly negotiate, and fight tooth and nail to not have negative accrual because you’ll spend forever digging out of it in butte. If you have even average loans and other consumer debt you’ll find the typical butte vet salary to be pretty limiting.

"25 years from being a boomer would put you at being born in 1979 or later, which does certainly make you gen X, but that would make you around 42 years old, so I would not accept your decade of experience in various cities. Ages 0-20ish really don’t count for too much as you’re largely subject to your parents whim. 
Your weekend travel, however, is more applicable. 
That experience is a little stunted because you’re not part of the daily weekday life, but completely still viable. 
If you don’t mind, what allows/forces you to travel around so often? 


It’s been my experience in Butte that the main roads tend to get plowed after a large storm event. Typically, by that point, there is already snow packed down which does not often get removed. So I will disagree, again, with your sentiment - Butte does plow. It’a just not mid-west quality.

This opportunity affords me the chance to even consider the idea of ever owning a home while working inside my profession. I’m a veterinary technician not a veterinarian. And while the there is a HUGE demand for veterinary staff everywhere. Not everyone is offering us what this opportunity is. 

I am making “good money” for my profession in Utah. And yet that is almost 20k less than the low end of this offer. Which means with the cost of living here in Utah I am pretty much drowning.  Most places are desperate across the country are just offering sign on bonuses. They aren’t offering a DAMN GOOD SALARY nor are they offering to help with relocation assistance.

"Calm down. 

I have been at work and responded to messages I could get to quickly. So unsure where your hostility is coming from. 

Your initial comment you stated Butte is the “ugliest city in Western Montana”. I was born and raised in Arizona. Butte is still prettier than where I grew up and while it may not be fabulous it is in a good location in the fact that (a hour drive is not a big deal to me) things are relatively close and my parents who are in Idaho would be closer to me than right now with where I am at in Utah.
Plus Butte is still prettier than Southeast Idaho imo… 

Cost of living is indeed cheap. From researching online Butte has a better rating than again where I am at now, and many other cities including some in Florida since I was on the phone with a dear friend when I was looking. 
Old buildings isn’t a new thing to me either… As Idaho and Utah are both guilty of them. Idaho also didn’t have AC which was something another person mentioned.


Eh… Idaho was guilty of the same issue… My parents home is on what feels like an Olympic ski jump and there were years I couldn’t make it up it or I slid in my old car. So that’s just something I’ve come to expect in winter conditions and it’s just something you account for. Plowing is going to be plowing. Never going to get around that. Literally drove home for Christmas and Idaho had no plows out and the i15 was ice and Utah did… 

Again those are all not that far away and I love exploring. So I don’t see a draw back in traveling to any of those cities to go play outside. It’s also just me and my dog. All of the bodies of water in Butte are still closer to any of the ones near me that are actually worth a damn. And again because I grew up somewhere where it was common to travel 2-3 hours to go somewhere I don’t have an issue with day trips for excursions. 

Liked visiting Missoula but hated being in… There is a huge appeal to small towns and as long as I have access to groceries in Butte during the winter I don’t need to go travel to larger towns in winter. As I stated to someone else I do a lot of my other shopping online. Sooooo can easily avoid just having to travel for shopping. 

The high end of the salary that’s being offered is about 20k higher than the low end, and my experience and just the absolute need for veterinary technicians absolutely means I can for once in my life live a comfortable life and do the things I want. Verses being “poor” because the cost of living is eating up my pay checks. 

Noooooow. Elevation, that’s whatever. Aside from it gives me hiccups being at a higher elevation. But I’ve dealt with that since 2015 when I first moved away from AZ. And we’ll 6 years of hiccups makes you get used to it.

You didn’t bring up grow season. No mention of superfund site in your first comment. 

Meth was a huge issue in Idaho, to the point that the first thing people told me was be careful when hiking because if I stumbled into the wrong area I may not come back. 
Cocaine is a huge issue here in Utah… Drugs are everywhere. Arizona had just about an issue with everything when I left. Doesn’t mean there isn’t people out there who are clean or things I can’t do to avoid it.

A lot of what you’re mad about me not responding to or mentioned in your second response you didn’t even bring up initially.

And a lot of it is stuff that as a women I’ve ran into from state to state. Old boys club isn’t new to me. 
Cops that abuse their power… not new to me either. Another redditor mentioned being abused by their doctors… that’s not uncommon for women to experience and I’ve had it happen in 3 states now. There is going to be issues everywhere. By god do I understand that… 

Butte can have it’s issues, it’s up for me to decide if those issues are better than the ones I’m facing now or if where I’m at is better.",t2_qmyiv,2seeyousmile,0,1640914681.0,0,t1_hqmjo1w,hqmjo1w,False,2seeyousmile,t3_rrr9l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Butte/comments/rrr9l5/had_a_recruiter_reach_out_to_me_about_a_job/,Had a recruiter reach out to me about a job opportunity in Butte just curious…,/r/Butte/comments/rrr9l5/had_a_recruiter_reach_out_to_me_about_a_job/hqmjo1w/,2,r/Butte,0,2

"Shocker. Someone who doesn't live here is bashing Butte. Even has the nerve to point out they bought a house here just to make money and doesn't want anything to do with making the community better. 

And this: ""The kicker? They dont plow those streets!"" Of course Butte plows the streets. Really stupid statement to make and proves this person knows nothing about this place. 

And this:  ""country's largest Superfund site."" There are 1,344 superfund sites in the US and 16 in Montana. Butte is not the largest superfund site in the US (you can easily look this up).  The local government in recent years finalized the last of the mining cleanup and the EPA set a goal to be delisted by 2024. I'm sure COVID-19 will delay that date, but my point is most of Butte (where people live, not the Berkeley Pit) has already been cleaned up. The Berkeley Pit water is currently being treated and released to Silver Bow Creek. I can't stress this enough.... Butte's drinking water comes from Basin Creek Reservoir, south of town, not anywhere near the Berkeley Pit.  Butte has some of the best drinking water in the state.

"I moved to Butte on a whim a little over two years ago. Most of my adult life, I’ve been fairly transient and have lived and traveled all over the world so my opinions of Butte are based on that and I’m comparing it to all the other places I’ve lived.   

Pros-  
Hands down the prettiest place I’ve ever lived.  

The cost of living is insanely cheap.   

The people are so nice and everyone knows something interesting about the town.   

If you enjoy the outdoors, you’ll never be bored.   

It actually snows during the winter.   

Getting a good workout in just means walking around the block.   

One of four towns in America where you can take your drink with you.   

Remarkably safe. I’m more afraid of being attacked by wildlife than I am another person.   

There’s so much wildlife! It’s like living in a Disney movie.   

Cons-  
There are very few good restaurants and I’m starving.   

There’s no Lowe’s or Home Depot which is wild to me with how old all the houses are. The lack of shopping is just, in general, odd.   

Im an introvert so I haven’t gotten the hang of the social scene, but that is also weird.  

People seem to get married and have kids really early and most of the town culture revolves around that. 

I’ll just come out and say this- Butte hates women. Not outwardly and in your face, but in a subtle low key way that permeates everything.   

Fire season is rough. The smoke just hangs in the Vally for weeks on end and it’s a real bummer.

"Purely subjective:

For a city of around 35k, there’s a lot to do - especially if you like outdoor activities. 
Housing is cheaper than pretty much any other of the large cities in MT. 
Groceries seem to be more expensive, and eating out is less expensive. The places there are to eat, though, are pretty good for MT.
Shopping is basically non-existent, so you have to travel about an hour to shop. 
Public transit is average for a small city. 

It gets very cold in the winter, and snows a bit, so make sure you have a vehicle suited for that.

"Mineral Museum is amazing!

Although now that winter is here, it's going to be rough finding good places to go collect.

Crystal Park is fun, but closed for the season. 

If you have a high clearance vehicle, check out Ringing Rocks just east of Homestake pass, north of the interstate at the Pipestone exit. Probably not accessible right now either.

If nothing else, check out various boat ramps and fishing accesses along the rivers for river rock scouring for agates, petrified wood, fossils, and other neat things.

"I'm assuming you haven't been to Butte? That's the assumption I'm basing my comment on. 

I'm not familiar with the industry you work in so I can't say whether there may be jobs available. You'll have to check online listings. I do know Butte is hoping to attract more film projects but not sure how that will go in the future. 

I will say that Butte is on a hill surrounded by very different mountain ranges so that may help with your sense of direction or memory. There are a lot of landmarks. If your modified scooter can handle the hills, you shouldn't have too much trouble getting around up town, downtown would depend on where you are. Take that with a grain of salt though as I don't have mobility issues. There is a bus system. 

Butte is a party town. When it throws down, it throws down, like St Patrick's Day and the third of July. If you are irritated by this, you WILL have a bad time some days of the year. If you don't care then you'll be fine. There will be drunk people all over uptown during St Pat's, and there will be fireworks leading up to and after the 4th, with pretty much non stop fireworks on the third and fourth. There is a big drinking culture as well. Weed is also popular. 

If you can visit, I would do that first. Some people hate it here. Others can't imagine living anywhere else. The town has a lot of pride so it is easy to offend people if you say you hate it.

Especially since they are a precious resource you won't get back, you can prevent the pre mature demolishing of the exterior façades often by shoring up. ""It's for safety"" does not necessarily means it needs to be torn down, but a safe zone established. We move too quickly often to, ""welp, tear it down."" When there's creative solutions to be had.

The Cavalier Lounge,

Other places to grab a drink-  
Butte Brewing Co. 
Headframe Spirits. 

Hikes-  
Walk from Montana Tech Campus to the Granite Mountain mine memorial via the copper way.  

Anything in Thompson Park area (also cool if you’re into disc golf)

Day trips-
Jackson hotsprings/big hole battle field. Hot spring plus a historic site. A very scenic hour drive from butte (especially if you drive over via Mill Creek)

"I think Linked Adventures is the only bike rental in town. They shuttle too but I’m not sure they’re running this early in the spring. Do try Derailed Bike Shop and Bad Beaver Bikes too. There’s still a ton of snow in the area. If you can get a fat tire bike they do groom trails south of town in Thompson Park. 
You can pedal from Derailed to the Granite Mountain Speculator Mine Memorial for a great view and over to the Big M to see the entire Summit Valley.

"This might be a bit too late, but the water quality of Butte is actually better than Bozeman. There is a water treatment plant that manages most of the toxic chemicals in the surrounding water and they do test it pretty regularly to make sure it stays that way. There are some people who think that the water testing is falsified, but there isn't any real evidence of that. 

 As far as the soil and dust, that is give or take. They put a soil cap around most of the toxic waste in Butte and have plants to hold it in place and that prevents most of the contaminates from blowing around. There are, however, some areas that are left untreated for historical comparison and those are found near the pit and on windy days some of the contaminants do get spread around, but Butte is safe for the most part.",t2_88z1oh9r,Liengu,0,1615573508.0,0,t1_gqpt4uw,gqpt4uw,True,topiramate,t3_kuuiwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Butte/comments/kuuiwq/soil_and_water_quality/,soil and water quality?,/r/Butte/comments/kuuiwq/soil_and_water_quality/gqpt4uw/,1,r/Butte,0,1

"I bought a house up in Centerville and as a non Butte native I was initially worried about the water and soil quality. 

I bought a water quality test for toxins and metal and my water is just fine. 

The county has a program that will test yard soil and attic insulation for mine waste and replace it if the numbers are too high. My yard was tested before I moved in and it’s fine. I’ve been told that the numbers need to be really high for the county to replace it but  I’ve also been told that the soil is better the higher you go because the rain washes the waste to the flats. I’ll probably get a private test once I do landscaping.

As for anecdotal evidence, my one neighbor is on her late 60’s and has lived on this street her whole life and never had cancer. She owns in her aunts old house who is in her 90’s before she was moved to a nursing home because she kept falling but also never had cancer. My two other neighbors are in their 60’s and never had cancer. 

I have read recently that cancer rates are higher in Butte than national average but Butte is also economically depressed and there has been a meth problem so it’s probably several different factors that contribute to that. 

On a personal level, I’ve lived in Detroit and Naples, Italy where the air and soil (and water in Naples) was terrible so this isn’t a huge issue for me anyways.",t2_srchhj6,Coder-Cat,0,1610379078.0,0,t1_giw2fpy,giw2fpy,True,topiramate,t3_kuuiwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Butte/comments/kuuiwq/soil_and_water_quality/,soil and water quality?,/r/Butte/comments/kuuiwq/soil_and_water_quality/giw2fpy/,4,r/Butte,0,4
"When I lived up on the hill and was considering buying the house,  someone came and tested our yards soil. It was definitely not good for gardening and did have a high rate of carcinogens. The house was literally put on top of a pile of mining waste is what we were told. A lot of people there seemed to wanna move to the flats, I guess partially because up on the hill has so much old mining waste. I don't live there anymore,  but it is a beautiful town. If you do go there, plan to spend a lot on Brita filters or to buy your own water. A neighboring town definitely was testing positive in their water for unsafe chemicals, so after that I stopped trusting the water as much. 

If you do go, be sure to visit the cute little coffee shop downtown and walk down near the mansions;  go run around near the M.

There's a fault running between them and the Continental Pit contains uplifted geology that has not been exposed to oxidation nearly as long as the Berkeley Pit geology.

"Gas was at $2.20 the other day which is really low, especially for a town so isolated. The wopchop from Freeway Tavern is the best porkchop sandwich around; since they renovated the place it's even better than I last had it. Joe's Pasty shop has some great pasties and is a must-try food! Pekin Noodle Parlor is the only Chinese food, but actually has pretty good Chinese if you're willing to give it a try - it's the oldest running Chinese restaurant in the United States. I think it's food may be seen as ""different"" for the mere fact that it's been running so long and has never had a compete competitor, but my family has always liked it. Alcohol is super cheap in Montana, casinos comp drinks often, and drinks are generally just cheap. No sales tax is a plus. The town itself is pretty rundown like what you would see in the ghettos of a major city, but it's relatively peaceful. You don't have to worry about gangs lurking or getting your property broken into - I have family still living in butte next to some real shacks and they've never had problems. Barwise, most anything in uptown Butte is a good choice. The M&M is great along with the surrounding bars and some nice breweries and distilleries. Sometime you could visit the Lady of the Rockies and she's always lit up at night. One of my favorite things about butte. There's usually not a lot going on in butte, especially with covid.

Everyone's pretty friendly, just don't be a dick. 

Not sure if it's open, but kind of a hidden gem if you're into it, there's a Mineral Museum on the Montana Tech Campus. Should still be free, some world class mineral specimens there. The mining museum is a separate thing next to campus. I haven't been on the underground tour there but I have been down in the mine several times and I think it's an experience people should have.
