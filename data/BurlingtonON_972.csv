"Sorry that I probably came off as aggressive towards you, your comment was pretty neutral and was just pointing out a way new parks can get created in a city. I've just grown tired of the same set of people in this subreddit that often rush to defend the City of Burlington staff and councillors when you point out their shortcomings and what I feel is their outright disingenuous behavior on this issue. I feel it is unacceptable to present plans and drawings that have no funding or proper plan behind them because of course without those two things they will never happen. However in the past when I've done this I receive multiple condescending comments back acting as if I'm being ridiculous and unfair and that of course all these wonderful drawings will come to pass, they just need more time...

Well like I said it's been another few years and I still see no plan or funding for it.

"That has worked for new areas in so called green field developments like north of highway 5 by Appleby, these parks the city is talking about rely on the city purchasing land and doing it themselves in areas that are already built up. They *could* require condo developers to help pay for these parks as part of their community development fees that they pay to the city but instead they have used most of those fees for the type of public art installations I mentioned earlier. Seriously the money from paradigm paid for the portal in the parking lot downtown, I am sure the people that live there get far more joy from staring at it than they would from a parkette where they live...

They have failed to do what you have talked about so far and I see no signs that they will suddenly change course. It is the city that released drawings assuring us of new parks along Fairview for all the development going in there by presenting pretty site plans, none of which are funded. The buildings are going up, some are already completed. The same was done for development by Aldershot GO, lovely drawings by the city assuring us of new park space that still isn't purchased or funded.

Sorry but they have failed so many times to follow through on these plans *in pre existing areas* that I simply don't believe them any longer.

"> that “concept” drawing is as feasible as the “concept cars”

This is the issue I have with so many of the lovely drawings the city puts out about high density development in this city, it seems like all of them are pipe dreams that never seem to come to pass. They imagine all these nice parks and amenities but don't have the money set aside to actually buy any of the land to make those parks. Even if they used eminent domain, which has to be approved by the federal or provincial government, they still have to pay market value for the property. Any plot of land in Burlington is worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Any plans for new parks require millions of dollars of funding which is non existent. The city needs to stop using the funds from developer benefits to install public art like the portal downtown or the pipes plains road and use it for more beneficial projects like parks. They need to actually follow through on these designs or stop lying to people.

Now I wonder if the same set of people that frequent the sub will once again rush to tell me how wrong I am and that all these pretty drawing will come to pass. If they do read this I have the same question for them I posed *literally years ago*, where is the parkette for the people that live in the three building development at Paradigm by the Burlington GO station?

It was featured in drawings released by the city almost years ago as to how the area would not turn into a giant field of asphalt. I was assured that I was being ridiculous and that it would all happen. Well it's been another 2 or 3 years since I was told that on top of all the years before that and the people that live in that development are still waiting for their parkette, all I see is asphalt.

And no don't tell me about they just purchased the existing park from the lions club, that deal was put in place in 1991 and the city got it for substantial discount and it was already a park, show me where the funding is for the new parks they plan to make in existing areas where they plan to put tens of thousands of people. The plans and money for those parks, paths and green space need to be put in place *now* before those buildings are built or it will be too late.

"While I'd like to see more missing middle condos have to be part of the solution. We literally built 80% of our cities as unsustainable low density sprawl. And those who own in those neighbourhoods will fight tooth and nail against missing middle ""poors"" moving into their neighbourhoods into such scary things like, **duplexes**. Until Burlington changes it's zoning, condos will need to be built to accomodate the growth and housing needs. This also looks appropriate to the area as immediately adjacent are similarly sized developments. Especially for Burlington's aging population, flats make total sense.

"A well behaved dog doesn't need to be rescued from a foreign agency.  This isn't some rare purebred breeding dog worth thousands that you got as an investment.

"Below is a statement of known facts, NOT OPINIONS.

The following symbols and corresponding meanings have been used by the Russian Armed Forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine \[17\]

Z: Attacking South-East Region such as Kherson, Mykolaiv, Mariupol. Deployed from Crimea / Rostov oblast, Russia

🅉 (enclosed in square): Attacking Kharkiv Deployed from Belgorod Oblast, Russia.

O: Attacking Chernihiv Oblast. Crossed border at Senkivka, Northern Ukraine.

V: Attacking North-west Kyiv Oblast. Deployed from Mazyr District, Belarus

The invasion has acquired the nickname ""Operation Z"", derived from the ""Z"" symbol.\[20\] The symbol is in the form of the Latin letter Z, instead of the equivalent Cyrillic letter З (Ze) used in the Russian alphabet, which has been described as peculiar considering the symbol's theme of Russian nationalism

The ""Z"" has been used as a pro-war symbol to represent support for the invasion despite the ambiguity of its meaning

On Instagram, the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) posted on 3 March that the ""Z"" symbol is an abbreviation of the phrase ""for victory"" (Russian: за победу, romanized: za pobedu), while the ""V"" symbol stands for ""Our strength is in truth"" (Russian: сила в правде, romanized: sila v pravde) and ""The task will be completed"" (Russian: задача будет выполнена, romanized: zadacha budet vypolnena).\[24\]\[25\]\[26\] The MoD later suggested alternative meanings for ""Z"", including ""For peace"" (Russian: за мир, romanized: za mir), ""For truth"" (Russian: за правду, romanized: za pravdu), and the letter Z inside the English words demilitarization and denazification, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has asserted to be the purpose of the invasion.

Another interpretation for ""Z"" is the Russian word for west (Russian: запад, romanized: zapad), to designate the Western Military District or west-bound infantry, or more generally to underline the Kremlin's imperial ambitions, with the ""V"" symbol similarly standing for the word for east (Russian: восток, romanized: vostok).",t2_kqze32oi,WarriorKnitter,0,1647925617.0,0,t1_i1mkkg0,i1mkkg0,False,ImAzura,t3_tcm259,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tcm259/pro_war_car_spotted_at_use_car_dealer_on_plains/,Pro War Car Spotted At Use Car Dealer On Plains,/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tcm259/pro_war_car_spotted_at_use_car_dealer_on_plains/i1mkkg0/,1,r/BurlingtonON,0,1

"Not all of them.  Some have the letter ""V""

Z is not included in the Russian or Cyrillic alphabet, with the letterinstead being taken from the Latin alphabet to reflect the pronunciationof the Russian word “за” which means “for”.

""за” has commonly featured at the beginning of patriotic Russian and Soviet Union slogans such as “за родину”, meaning “for the homeland” in Cyrillic.

The ‘Z’ symbol was featured alongside the phrase “за победу”, meaning“for victory” and with “за мир” meaning “for peace”, but has alsodominantly featured alongside the hashtag “СвоихНеБросаем” – roughlytranslating to “we don’t leave our own” in English.

What does Russia’s V symbol mean?

Russia’s use of Z and V symbols has been used interchangeably, with ‘V’also used in graphics to stand for ‘victory’ in Putin’s militarycampaign.

But it has also been closely aligned with the phrase “Сила правде”meaning “Power of Truth” and “задача будет выполнена”, which means “thetask will be completed”.",t2_kqze32oi,WarriorKnitter,0,1647924767.0,0,t1_i1mjbmi,i1mjbmi,False,ImAzura,t3_tcm259,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tcm259/pro_war_car_spotted_at_use_car_dealer_on_plains/,Pro War Car Spotted At Use Car Dealer On Plains,/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tcm259/pro_war_car_spotted_at_use_car_dealer_on_plains/i1mjbmi/,1,r/BurlingtonON,0,1

You cannot get a ticket for 1-9 km's over in Ontario. You’re correct about demerit points beginning at 15 over.

"It makes sense based on the logic of price increase of lumber, steel, cement and other materials that have doubled or tripled in price. However, double the price is like saying “we don’t want to lose money here, actually let’s make more profits than we originally were by charging todays market price”. It’s very obvious that they are taking advantage of the current cost circumstances and leveraging out the “pandemic” as reasoning. The cost increase should be shared with complete transparency to all buyers. Like where these costs are coming from and going with all the details that would be in proportion to new evaluation. They need to not explain in summary, but be exact with numbers like a professional developer.

"If you're just getting started no need for fancy equipment. I use a $12 pizza pan I bought at bed bath and beyond and my parents use their 30 year old pans over the pizza stone we bought them as a gift thinking it would be a nice upgrade. 


 Try a bunch of different recipes to see what is best for you and your tools. Some recipes call for heats my oven can't handle well so I've moved on to others. I make my own pizza and really enjoy it. It's definitely best done on a day not at work so you can make your dough after lunch and leave it to rise until you want to eat in the evening. I use a simple recipe - flour (bread or all purpose both work), yeast, olive oil, warm water and a pinch of salt. Normally mix it up around 2pm and it'll be in great shape to stretch around 8-9. We've tried different sauces and toppings galore and have a lot of house favourite combos. 


When we experiment with new toppings or seasonings instead of a big pizza we do a ton of small ones so we can do different combos and taste test them all. Delicious science.

"Yeah I was involved in a somewhat major accident a few years ago just a little further down the road at Fairview/Guelph line. Was going through the intersection down Guelph line and person in intersection turning left onto Fairview didn't wait in the intersection for me to clear. Boom. No injuries at all, we were super lucky. My car got completely totaled.

I suspect this accident was similar given the positioning of the cars involved. Definitely brought back deja vu. I really think the whole transition from advanced green to waiting in the intersection to turn left should be reviewed. A lot of people don't get the memo and serious accidents like the one I was in, and maybe this one, occur. 

The good news is that specific intersection actually will be undergoing some changes soon. I know a new lane is being added on the Harvester side to accommodate the volume of traffic. I forget what else is being added, but I live nearby so all the residents of the neighbourhood got the planned proposal.

"From what you're describing a kamado may be overkill although I'd never talk somebody out of buying one. 

I'm a fan of the classic [kettle grill](https://www.weber.com/CA/en/grills/charcoal-grills/original-kettle/original-kettle-premium-charcoal-grill-22/14401001.html) but you mentioned wanting a side table which certainly is handy. Looks like they only offer that with the gas starter. I've never used a charcoal grill with a gas starter so it could be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but (for me) part of the appeal of charcoal is the simplicity of it. A weber kettle is basically a metal container with some vents, kamado's are fancy oversized flowerpots. With reasonable care and maintenance they can last 20+ years and still be as effective as new. 

But, that's me. As I said I haven't tried it so it could be a genuinely killer feature. I used to use a [charcoal chimney.](https://www.weber.com/CA/en/accessories/what's-hot/must-have-accessories/7416.html) I'm lazy though and switched to an [electric starter](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/grillpro-electric-charcoal-starter/1000413894) so I can see the appeal of an integrated starter, I'd just be concerned about it being a point of failure.",t2_5pohi,nutstothat,0,1647529224.0,0,t1_i10xs7g,i10xs7g,False,Ambitious_Proposal70,t3_tecado,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tecado/skirt_steak/,Skirt steak,/r/BurlingtonON/comments/tecado/skirt_steak/i10xs7g/,1,r/BurlingtonON,0,1

"Back in the 1960s there was a plan afoot to expand and develop Kerns Road. It would become a more direct route to Waterdown. As this was being planned an industrious entrepreneur built a Kentucky Fried Chicken* outlet on Kerns Road near the quarry. For a few short years it was open, but then due to unknown political machinations, Burlington did not go ahead with the Kerns Road development and it was left as a country road. The KFC closed and it was later torn down. For years after my parents would point out where it once stood because you could see the concrete pad just off the road. Ultimately, someone must have been lead to believe that Kerns Road would be the next big thing only to find out that Burlington had other plans.

There's nothing about meat quality per se on the Halton website   
[https://www.halton.ca/For-Business/Food-Safety-for-Business/Requirements-for-Food-Vendors](https://www.halton.ca/For-Business/Food-Safety-for-Business/Requirements-for-Food-Vendors)

And then there's a whole Federal standards on top, which controls what can be moved around.  I think a lot of the meat industry is federally regulated.  
[https://inspection.canada.ca/food-safety-for-industry/food-specific-requirements-and-guidance/meat-products-and-food-animals/eng/1523875902268/1523875902549](https://inspection.canada.ca/food-safety-for-industry/food-specific-requirements-and-guidance/meat-products-and-food-animals/eng/1523875902268/1523875902549)  


Halton region health inspectors might be reporting on a local restaurant using circus animals for lasagna, but the city isn't in control of what laws that would make that illegal or not.  I think.  In Toronto, the city has control of what kind of meat can be sold on the street, which is why it's mostly hot dogs compared to what's available in other North American cities.  On the Halton website there's a section about how hot meat internal temperature should be.  But I think that's really just parroting, essentially saying ""follow Ontario/Canada food laws.""  Because, it's not like Halton could say, ""Hey totally go ahead and serve people raw chicken if you like.""  


Anyone know more about this?

"When I was growing up we had a “conspiracy theory” (more of Burlington Urban Legend) that the Sidrabene Latvian Recreation & Retreat on Appleby Line was actually a Cult/Satanic Temple and kids camp where they indoctrinated children into the Cult.

We got as far as parking when a nice gentlemen approached us wondering why we had parked in his driveway… after explaining our “theory” he laughed and said it was Latvian day camp. We left, very disappointed, we hadn’t uncovered some big evil Burlington secret.

"I have a BGE and don't get me wrong, I love, love, love it. But I have to agree with /u/surSEXECEN a kamado joe is a much better value. As a friend of mine called it, BGE is the Cadillac of smokers, you're paying for the name.


Weber vs kamado style largely comes down to how & what you're cooking. Are you looking to do quick 'grilling' type food? Steaks, burgers, chicken, etc.. Are you looking to do long low-n-slow smokes? Pulled pork, brisket, etc.. 

Kamado types are good for retaining a consistent heat for a very long time which makes them ideal for long cooks. They certainly can be used quite well for direct grilling but they usually have a smaller area so it's harder to set up a proper 2-zone cook, and if you overheat the grill it takes a long time to cool down.  

With a Weber you get more cooking surface for your money (and are far cheaper.) Because they're not insulated it's easier to have a 'hot' side hot and a 'cool' side cool for different temp zones. They can be excellent smokers but require more attention than a kamado. I personally would skip an integrated gas igniter, a charcoal chimney or electric lighter (never lighter fluid) makes it a snap.  

This [site](https://amazingribs.com/ratings-reviews-and-buying-guides/ratings-reviews-grill-and-smoker-reviews/) goes into the benefits/drawbacks of different BBQ styles and the reviews look to be trustworthy.

"Millcroft (the name of your new neibourhood) has some of the best amenities. You have two huge plazas super close to you that will cover 99% of the things you need within a 2 minute drive. LCBO, Canadian Tire, Groceries, take out food, Shoppers. And 5 more minutes up at Dundas and Appleby are Walmart and  a hundred other stores. 

I can think of only two negatives:

- You're really far from downtown, which is where our festivals are, and the bars that have the best live entertainment. Not a huge deal, but public transit north of the highway is not the best. As an earlier poster said, its a very car-dependent area.

- The Orchard was the first development of high-density detached and townhouse in Burlington. Before that, every development was your standard 50-100 lot with smaller homes. A lot of old-Burlington residents (boomers and up) have a really negative view of The Orchard, because they feel like it was the first of something they feel ruined Burlington. Same as the current backlash against condos. Its silly, but there are still people that treat The Orchard like the punchline of a joke. Not to your face, however.

"> I also don't agree with advocating of violence or destruction of personal property. 

I do.

If you see a fascist, one of the best things you can do (other than advocating for systemic change that is going to help deradicalize them) is be willing to show that there is an utter and total disdain for their politics. The only times Nazi marches went poorly for the Nazis, was when thousands of people would meet them in the streets and be willing to physically and violently rebuke them.

This guy is ripping a symbol quickly becoming associated with the mass murder of innocent civilians, if there is ever a time to be willing to brick a window or a throw a punch, this is it.

Karl Popper's Paradox of Tolerance makes that clear that to maintain a tolerant and open society, you must be intolerant to ideas that are fundamentally opposed to such notions.

Edit - I'm not even sure if we should take you seriously. You're a new account with two comments, of which one is this and the other contains

"The Brant St of end of Cavendish is where I noticed it.  I usually turn up Eaglesfield, and can’t comment on the rest. I’ve been riding that stretch occasionally for about 10yrs. 

I recall the bike lanes (pretty sure both sides) quickly became defacto street parking. Later they turned it into actual street parking, but only on one side.  I suspect it was “no parking” initially, but not sure. 

Cavendish isn’t particularly dangerous for cyclists either way. The lanes were already wide enough, and the traffic is light and local. Meanwhile, Burlington’s many highway crossings all remain very dangerous.
