"Look beyond the big names.  Sycamore Terrace, Cobblestone, International Village, Heritage Trail, etc all pop up first but they're going to be pricey.  The places downtown are well outside your budget (I don't know how anyone in Terre Haute affords some of those apartments).  

Try Raintree Village near US 41 North and Evans.  Its well outside city limits but its a quiet area.  With 41, its still a quick drive into town plus Plaza North, Kroger, and Menards are fairly close.  

As someone else mentioned, Pfizer and Berkshire Hathaway have a lot of smaller rental properties all over the area.  They have small houses, duplexes, and apartments.

The Avenues is a less than desirable area.  Its roughly an area between Union Hospital and ISU, from Third Street to around 25th.  East of ISU, avoid the area starting north of Wabash.  So when you see any 1st Ave, 2nd Ave, etc, that's the big clue.  Liberty, Locust, and others are not great.  

All of that said...  I lived on 4th Ave for nearly a year.  I had some really cool neighbors.  One guy helped me a lot on my truck.  We never had a break in and didn't have anything stolen.  Some guy went through out trash in the alley once so that was annoying.  There are some sketchy looking people in the area.  I've found its a lot of people with health issues that's forced them into cheaper housing as well as young couples that can't afford anything else.  

Its been a long time but I also rented an apartment on Washington in Farrington's Grove (an area south of Downtown between 3rd and 7th.

Heritage trail is wonderful but super expensive. Sycamore Terrace is great but even more expensive (for weird stuff like a trash concierge).

"As far as food goes.

If you like Sushi, our local place is considered by many to be one of the better ones in the State. Umi Grill. There are a bunch of ""off menu"" rolls, so I would definitely suggest asking your server.

"I'm not sure what the convention cost so I'm not sure I'll weigh in on worth it. 

Will it help? Well, that depends. I can't picture many conventions choosing Terre Haute over big cities like Indianapolis. Terre Haute is simply less convenient for larger conventions that involve air travel. Then again, is it even the venue for larger conventions? 

Downtown is much better than it was 20 years ago. I remember visiting Coffee Grounds in my teens or even the sad little Children's Museum. Now there's at least a dozen restaurants, a wine tasting room, two nice functional hotels, and several attractions. So if the convention center can bring in outside money, there's good locally owned venues to spend it at. 

Part of the drawer of a convention is the local amenities. I still don't think Terre Haute compares with other cities like Bloomington but it's a good start. 

I also know someone who has a wedding booked there.

"What is the point to ""drifting""? I ask because you seem very concerned about your surroundings - neighbors, property, and laws. That's good. I, for one, appreciate it.

I'm asking you why because I observed this very behavior - in the yard next door. So to speak. A couple of home lots - that have their houses torn down. Just a big empty lot now. I listened to a guy come by and ""spin-out"" over and over again, all day! 

I tried to come up with reasons for justifying this. \~\~\~\~\~

Needs to test some new mod? Nope...did it far too many times to just be testing. 

Wanted to plow up the dirt? Nope. Only left circular divots. Now when the kids go over there to play - they'll have to wade through mud - if it's a wet day. 

Testing for police enforcement? Nope. They never seem to be around in this town anyway (West Terre Haute, not Terre Haute). And they never seem to care if the ordinance ""violation"" is with regards to ""safety for others"", i.e. parking in the wrong direction, or broken muffler pipes (causing permanent damage to hearing if exposed long enough, but def temp damage). Or cutting off a merging car instead of practicing safe driving and use the zipper merge process.

Just want the thrills? Probably. See, I get that. I really do. I jumped out of an airplane just for the thrill. I've travelled to foreign countries just for the thrill. When I was a kid I was always the highest tree climber. So many stories I can tell you but I shouldn't have to.  

\~\~\~\~\~

Here is the problem - we, as a society, have a contract with each other, it is sometimes referred to as ""the social contract"". An obligation to follow certain rules and recommendations. Why? Well, as humans we thrived and climbed to the top of the Apex Predator pyramid. We didn't climb it individually, we did it as a team.  

Long ago, we figured out - if we worked together - we are more than the ""sum total of our "". So once we figured out we were better together - we found that each human is very individual. And ""vive la difference!"" I mean that - everyone deserves to be their own person. But you are now in a ""contract"" with the rest of society - IF YOU WANT TO BENEFIT FROM THE SOCIETY."" 

So what things must you do to succeed? 

Participate when participation is needed, e.g., get a job and contribute to the economy. You see how you are not treated as an equal when you don't have a job? Or drive the same speed as everyone else, following the lines. Should I explain what happens when 1 person speeds all over the lines and others are also out their driving? We do have race tracks to resolved this violent urge for drivers - but in the meantime - ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". Sometimes you gotta do something you don't like or don't do something you do like for the sake of ""community"". Don't want to participate. No problem. Get out. Get out as far as you can away from all communities, social structures, human civilization. There in the wilds by yourself - you have no obligation to support the big picture. You may ""drift"" all you want. 

Don't like the idea of having to move to isolation to do your favorite activities? Find substitutes, like the worlds highest roller coaster, or ziplining, as couple of ""thrill"" activities that are approved. OR ELSE you actively participate in getting your community on board with you - get the ordinances or laws changed. Campaign for reform. *You see how some cities have skateboard parks? That's because they got sick and tired of athletic teens (and adults) using their skateboard on the steps of the courthouse to do slides, nollies, and aerial tricks.* Find a business with a big lot willing to host ""drifting"". Find a big empty lot nearby - and find a way to raise money, awareness, buy the lot, and conform to any zoning needs - and voilà, you can, with community approval drift away...

Listen, I don't begrudge you asking in this forum. I don't begrudge you your constitutional rights. I just think - if you thought ahead and realized why there are rules - you might actually have a great future. I doubt if I will ever sell my house. I was an out-of-stater and didn't know what West Terre Haute is like. But apparently, all of Terre Haute and West Terre Haute know that it's normal to drive around with broken muffler pipes, to use the loud-assed lawn mower on taxed pavement (that we paid for with our annual license plates and registrations), heck, I even hear rap booming by my house. I bought in West Terre Haute because I was told it was ""rural"" which means quiet...countryside living. I feel gypped and cheated.  I did my part - I ponied up the money legally to buy this house and move in. I met all the requirements - now I have to live with my decision - that a vast majority of West Terre Haute has no respect for anyone - not even themselves. Sell the house and move? I'm not rich enough to take the losses - I will incur. So I just find people like you and wonder if I am frank and frankly just a bit ""ranty"" I know...maybe I will get through. 

We get parented for *manners* for 18 years, children are excused from adult punishment, when they violate an adult crime *(please don't come at me with exceptions - it's not the point),* we get called out as behaving like a child, all of this because that's what children are - little humans learning to live in a community. 

And if you respond by calling me names or telling me to take a flying f<bleep>k - then I'll know you are still children - learning. Maybe when you buy your own house next to a train station or airport or racetrack - you'll finally understand why we have so many rules about keeping the peace while in town/city/suburban limits.",t2_7qmja9iz,Greedy-Fennel60,0,1642960714.0,0,t1_htwn41s,htwn41s,True,SpeeedyBoi,t3_g3lpcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrehaute/comments/g3lpcs/good_spots_to_practice_drifting/,Good spots to practice drifting?,/r/terrehaute/comments/g3lpcs/good_spots_to_practice_drifting/htwn41s/,1,r/terrehaute,0,1

"I know the post is an old one, but wanted to answer if someone else stumbles upon this thread. If you are 21 and up, Bar Botics is open on Wabash from 3 to ? ( I don't know when they close) they have arcade machines that are free and a bar. Great place to hang out, if you are >= 21. The Haute City Center ( formally known as Honey Creek Mall ) has an arcade by the food court again. I took a friend who never experienced an arcade before and we had fun, we had a good healthy competition with the games. Also wanted to add that Haute City Center now has a LAN center in the mall by Gamestop called OMEGA (just a way for malls to have another income stream, it was developed by the owner of eBash on 3rd), anyway there's a store called ""Bank of Pinball"" right next to it in the old bank. Nothing but pinball machines, I think they are adding a second story of pinball machines as well. Great way of killing time.   Hope it helps.

"I remember there used to be a local collectible import car club. Don't ask me what the models were--I just remember they were small, European imports, and classics (i.e. - think old man cars and not something like Ferrari or Lamborghini or some other super-car type). We also have a few in the area who attend car shows... 

Beyond those people, it's mostly local high schoolers that hang out in various parking lots (i.e. - Kroger's over on Wabash?) and the 9 or 10 local Tesla owners that you sometimes see plugged-in over at the Meijer superchargers.

But all that aside, there's not much of a ""car scene"" around here like the kind I'm assuming you're hoping for. Nobody (that I know of, at least) hang out with each other to show off their cars, ride up and down Wabash or along 3rd while jamming to tunes or picking up chicks (ha), helping each other out with customizations and upgrades, etc. like they maybe did back in the 80s and early 90s. I hope I'm wrong but it seems as if that kind of culture died when society opted for a ""replace it"" culture over the ""repair or modify it"" culture that it depends on. I mean, with things being the way they are here in Terre Haute where the best kind of automotive shop we have is basically Autozone or shops who tout oil changes as repairs...well, you're not fostering anything that would prop up a cultural scene like the one ""car clubs"" stay alive with. And then you have the soy knobs who prefer electric and or self-driving over gas-powered engines or high horse sounds... I mean, the automotive archetype can't exist in that kind of setting, which is partly due to companies pushing their agendas to prevent customizations or even personal ownership but also partly due to people buying into it, too (see people who prefer moronic touch screens for everything, who turn the environmental concerns into religious beliefs, or who know nothing about personal automotive maintenance in general nor show any desire to know more about it).",t2_iiquk,Elminster_Aumar,0,1580484367.0,0,t1_fg3liew,fg3liew,True,jhole0303,t3_ewn921,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrehaute/comments/ewn921/car_scene/,Car scene?,/r/terrehaute/comments/ewn921/car_scene/fg3liew/,1,r/terrehaute,0,1

"It's a completely different experience. 

To start with, every game you play at eBash is a game you can play at home. Not so much with arcades. At eBash, you have 1 type of person who comes there: computer nerds who have to go 20 rounds to understand the differences between ""arcade"" and ""glorified computer lab."" They have their little seats, 'puters, dirty headphones... It's a somewhat isolated experience vs. the one you have when you're walking around, dropping quarters into multiple machines, all with varying forms of function and use. I won't say that arcades are known for their pleasant scents but I'll be damned if a room full of gamers equates to what one might smell when walking into Smoke N' Peace.

eBash is a very rigid, manufactured experience that gets old quick and one you can easily replace with a couple friends at your own house and some Cat 5, etc. You can't do that with an *arcade*. You can't do that with a lot of the games you get to play in an arcade (or at least, you're not supposed to be able to but given how things have changed with tech, one can debate that).

"Maybe I misled you, so let me be clear: I didn't mean to imply that I knew for a fact that the library would allow volunteers. Rather, I suggested them because they seemed like a place that would / could be. You'll have to ask them directly to be sure, okay?

As for the ""abusing comment,"" what I meant is that I've seen places abuse people volunteering by slowly pushing them to do more than they should. For example, if you go into a place volunteering to, say, work in a kitchen to clean dishes but then slowly get dragged into things that go beyond that, like cleaning toilets, watching kids, organizing storage spaces, etc., that's when a red flag needs to get raised in your mind. 

I once volunteered for a place to work on a website. It slowly turned into not just web design but web development, database design and administration, operations security, user maintenance, marketing, workstation maintenance and repair, account provisioning, order handling, software and server upgrades... The list never ended and only got worse but started from nothing more than one's interpretation of what my volunteerism was interpreted as. The same applies for you: depending on what you volunteer for, be leery of things ""creeping"" into more than what you bargained for and if the person leading the troop tries to push you into doing more than what you're okay with, don't feel bad for putting your foot down. There's always other places to volunteer for who will appreciate and respect your altruism as they should.",t2_iiquk,Elminster_Aumar,0,1575254592.0,0,t1_f9ey5i5,f9ey5i5,False,lulupie2002,t3_e4o9dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrehaute/comments/e4o9dk/places_for_teens_to_volunteer/,Places for teens to volunteer?,/r/terrehaute/comments/e4o9dk/places_for_teens_to_volunteer/f9ey5i5/,1,r/terrehaute,0,1

"I'd suggest any local non-profit. I know the Ryves Youth Center at Etling Hall would probably be open to it (just go there some time and ask for the director). Otherwise, you might consider Trees, Inc., the Terre Haute Humane Society, or Habitat for Humanity. Besides those places, you might also check in with the Vigo County Public Library or the CANDLES Holocaust Museum and Education Center. I would think that even the Atlantis Aquatic Gardens pet shop over on 13th might be open to a volunteer (ask for Bill) but that's reaching given it's not common to see volunteerism taking place at for-profit establishments, though it has happened before; it's just that some laws might come into play when that's the context. Either way, just ask people at those locations and I'm sure they'll come up with something for you. :)

Hope this helps and props to you or whoever it is that's in search of this info. Remember, though: don't let the volunteerism be abused. We all want to help but there's a lot of people out there that exploit / abuse it, too. Don't let that happen.",t2_iiquk,Elminster_Aumar,0,1575243071.0,0,t1_f9eejeh,f9eejeh,True,lulupie2002,t3_e4o9dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrehaute/comments/e4o9dk/places_for_teens_to_volunteer/,Places for teens to volunteer?,/r/terrehaute/comments/e4o9dk/places_for_teens_to_volunteer/f9eejeh/,2,r/terrehaute,0,2

"Yes to everything here!! I’m kind of new to TH, and one thing that has really bugged me is the lack of community pride and respect for one’s own “stuff.” Probably 90% of the time I tell people where I’m from, they’re like “why the hell did you come HERE?! Terre Haute sucks...it’s so boring...I wish I could leave...etc.” 

It’s a cultural thing.

I wanted to take my dumb Insta pic at the mural and saw the same shit you’re describing. Yeah, 12 Points isn’t super great right now, but it’s never going to be unless we start making small consistent efforts.

FWIW, I actually LIKE Terre Haute. I like living here. We have a low cost of living, laid back culture and sone pretty damn awesome restaurants. Out library is doing good stuff. The children’s museum is great. We have good higher education. We’re getting a casino (which I think will be good!).  We have access to cool cities within an easy drive. The festivals are fun. We have good beer. There’s a lot to like and I think we are actually in an upward trajectory if we’ll allow it.

Hi! So ive had anxiety since i was young my doctor diagnosed me which my mom refused to admit. It gets really bad when talking to people i have an out of body experience just explaining that ive had brain surgery. I wouldnt have a ride to therapy since my mom doesnt have a car and she wont make me appointments. I did have therapy for a day this year and my mom kept forgetting to make appointments and they closed down so i kind of just gave up on therapy because she got into my head when she said it wont help and now i believe her because im sick of having out of body experiences when i talk about problems or really anything with new people.,t2_3d55d37k,lulupie2002,0,1566952335.0,0,t1_ey9tqvv,ey9tqvv,False,[deleted],t3_cw7z8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrehaute/comments/cw7z8s/anyone_on_here_go_to_north_or_south/,Anyone on here go to north?

"As far as the anxiety thing is concerned, it's when you leave school with it following you into adulthood that it becomes a serious issue to worry about. Right now, you're of the age where you have access to school resources that can help you learn from it and better manage it, but even then, it's important to not put a cart before the horse as it may not even be anxiety--something you won't know for sure until you speak to a qualified person about this who has the appropriate training and professional experience necessary to determine things like that. I say this because some anxiety can be a *good* thing--it just depends on specifics, the situations, the people, etc. There's a lot to it. But if what you're experiencing is interfering with your life on a daily basis to a point where it shows no improvements or is leading to more severe things like depression, then it might be time to see someone about it to get it fixed. Start with your school: it's what they're there for.

All that being said, have you spoken to anyone from your school about any an all of this? 

What I would do if I were you is either get with a guidance counselor or a trusted teacher and explain to them everything you've explained on here. Explain your concerns about your anxiety, your efforts to find friends to hang out with, etc. Depending on your interests, you should also stress how you'd be interested in being part of some school clubs or activities centered around your interests as that would be a fantastic way for you to meet new people who share your interests, all being awesome stuff that could completely turn your life around in great ways.

Look, you didn't do anything wrong by reaching out on here. I didn't mean to come across like that if I did. In all honesty, that part was actually great because not many people know when to reach out for help or suggestions... I only urged caution when doing so due to how the world can be when it comes to online interactions, especially for younger people. You can't be too careful.

So anyway, start there: go speak with either a guidance counselor or a teacher, turn over some rocks about what options you have, explain the piece about needing a ride to things, too, and I'm betting you'll get something figured out by the end of the week. :)

"Do you have any hobbies and if so, have you had any luck with those? If I were you, that would be the first place to start. 

Call me old fashioned but if I were you, I'd try to avoid liaisons from random internet people, especially if you're still in high school. That reeks of bad outcome, so play it safe, okay?

But that aside, you might consider getting into aquaria (i.e. - starting either a freshwater or saltwater aquarium). There's more people in town that do those kinds of things than you might think, many of which frequent Atlantis Aquatic Gardens over on 13th towards the North side of town.

Maybe get a gym membership and meet some people?

You could also do the whole loiter-at-Starbucks thing, too. I've met a few people that way, at least whenever they raise their heads up long enough from their laptops to realize that they're in a room of actual people.

What makes any town is its people and the relationship you have with them. If people simply look for entertainment then most small towns will fall short.

"If you're moving here, be prepared to experience mediocrity at its finest. Here, a night out on the town boils down to either bar hopping or else making a foray to one of the local grocery stores. At some point, we might have a chance to enjoy a casino (and whatever events or shows it might be possible to see there) but we're still ironing-out the legislative wrinkles to get the shovels going... You'll have to wait to take part in the mega jail tour, so try to hold your excitement for that at bay (sadly, it's not built yet--I know, I know: I can't wait for it either!). Of course, this entire city will transform into a beautiful little butterfly of economic prowess once we're basking in the brilliance of our beloved convention center. Just kidding! The convention center won't change dick about what this place does for its people. If anything, it will just be meeting space for local hotels and their foul-coffee-breath suits for things only they care about.

Look, Terre Haute has everything you *need*, **just nothing you want**. I can be as loyal to the home team as anyone else is but at some point, you have to accept and admit that this place just fucking sucks dirty donkey ass. The mall is all but dead (thanks Bezos, you cheating prick!). We've had numerous SWAT stings on local officials, which is funner to watch than the shows ISU offers for students. You can throw a rock in any which direction and hit the rotten wood belonging to a dozen homes that have more raccoons and roaches living in them than people. Yes, you have a few trails or whatever but once you've done that about 2 or 3 times, the newness of it wears off and you're left spending more energy swatting at Buffalo Gnats or sidestepping snakes than you are enjoying some sort of weird self-conflated enjoyment of nature everyone tries to believe in. Sooner or later, you'll blossom into one of a million kids we all see everyday over at Starbucks or Java Haute, loitering on their little laptops and telling themselves, ""See? I knew there was **SOMETHING** to do in this town!"" Sadly, you'll soon see that you'll have more fun walking around [Atlantis Aquatic Gardens](http://www.atlantisaquaticgardens.com/) (a local pet store on 13th) than you will anything else... Sorry, I shouldn't be so negative. It's just that this city is so mismanaged that once you've been here for awhile, you get tired of hearing the incessant excuses that the loyal locals keep trying to give for the social engine that never seems to turn over despite the headstrong perseverance they all have when trying to turn their little keys to make it work: they've all been brainwashed into believing that walking around on some path, sitting at some bar, or eating at some restaurant is ""something to do,"" like they've accepted their inevitability of lameness and that it's answer enough for the simple fact that this city's limp-dick leadership cares nothing about the quality of life due to this place being managed by over-the-hill losers that care more about publication or their yard landscaping than they do anything their stations were voted for, which is providing more carrot than the stick we're getting for those cursed with residence to this toilet.

...but all that is just my opinion. I've lived here for years... What do I know, right?

Anyway, your first objective before doing anything is getting your living arrangements established. If I were you, I'd be doing everything I could to find an actual **house** to rent. Stay the fuck away from apartments in this city because you'll be driven mad by how shoddy they are or how mismanaged or chaotic they'll tend to be. 

What? You saw a bug? Only **a** bug? Sounds like a good day to me! 
What? Your paper-thin walls are rattling from your neighbor? Hey, at least your stained plaster isn't cracked! 
What? Your pipe is leaking? We'll have the maintenance guy out right away! (Fast-forward a year...)

Best places to search would be on the outskirts of either Seelyville or maybe somewhere in Brazil. They have some okay places for around $5-600 per-month (if you can wing that) and it's still within driving distance from ""Terredise"" (but also, Greencastle). After that, you'll be hard-pressed for employment options. If you're a college kid, you'll probably find something hopefully paying between $10-15 per-hour but you'll probably be lucky if you do. You'll just have to keep nagging people and keep trying to network your way into something probably nobody wants to do. I'm sure you'll make enough friends to have people to hang with, which is good, so socializing shouldn't be a problem but like others have said, you'll have to work at it because everyone around here pays more attention to their bullshit phones than they do the person that's standing right in front of them.

"Terre Haute has gets a bad wrap but I feel like any mid size city gets shit on like there's absolutely nothing to do. That's not really the case but as someone else said you have to interact with TH to enjoy it. It's not the kind of town that will lure you out if you're introverted or just lazy. Bar scene has lost a couple downtown staples but you still have The Verve, Ballyhoo (college aged), and Sonkas. On the near North side there's a newish bar called Tolleys that's really taken off and is heavy on the karaoke. A bit further East on Wabash there's Bohannons if your looking for a low key dive bar atmosphere...same goes for The Teepee on 25th and Hulman or Stephens Inn on S. 13th. There's a new bar in the Medows called Poplar Pub that shows some promise if they can get some personality in the bar...a little plain at the moment. 

When it comes to dining there's probably more restaurants per capita than anywhere else you've been. Seriously...there's a ton of restaurants here. A lot of chains and a lot of mom and pop shops but for higher end dining the best in the area are Stables Steakhouse on Poplar, J Fords on Walnut just on the outskirts of downtown, Tokyo, and there's a new Italian place on south 7th where Simeralls bar used to be. I think it's something like Alimentari de Pezevento (I probably butchered that!) They also have a bar next door called Bosco Bar. There's another Italian place up north called Pilonis that's sort of higher end and really authentic.

For activities there's alot of festivals throughout the warmer months and they seem to be doing more and more along the river in Fairbanks park. Deming park is really nice to walk around and they have a frisbee golf course. Dobbs park further East has walking trails as does Hawthorne Park. There's a vast bike trail called the Heritage Trail that spans miles and miles all the way out to East Glenn. It's a really great option if you enjoy running or cycling. There's also 4 golf courses in town if you're into golf at all. For some more adventurous hiking you can travel an hr north to Turkey Run State park which is absolutely gorgeous. They have some pretty incredible trails and there's also some tube/canoe rentals up there if you want to spend a summer day boozing and floating down the creek. A bus will drop you off at one point and then pick you up down stream a few miles. I'm leaving some stuff out I'm sure but feel free to holler at me if you ever need anything once you get here. I'm a lifer so there's not much I don't know about the place.

"The only real perk living here is how cheap it is.  You sound like an nice innocent young individual so just scout out where you're going to be living.  I've had pretty much all of my stuff stolen while living in the Avenue's for example.  Jobs aren't the easiest to fall into here, either.  Mix of being so old some places don't wanna use technology and others are franchises that require you to apply online but don't follow up on that well.  Word-of-mouth on campus is probably what you need most, tons of temp jobs for college kids that guys like me can never get onto lol.

"It’s a typical modern rust belt midsize town. Dying retail, lots of chain restaurants but despite a lot of negativity there is a heart. 

Terre Haute won’t blow you away with entertainment but there are good festivals throughout the year. It’s less than 3 hours to Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Louisville. 

There’s minor league baseball, dirt track racing, college sports. There is a prominent Asian population due to the university with 2 nice Asian markets. 

There are multiple antique stores. Some great local restaurants including the top sushi restaurant in the Midwest by many.  Square donuts is a staple and Baeslers market is a great place to shop. 

You have great hidden gems like turkey run state park to the north for hiking, camping and kayaking. There is an exotic feline rescue center. 

Local universities put on plays and free concerts. St. Mary’s has an alpaca farm which is cook. The Terre Haute children’s science museum is a wonderful asset. 

Terre Haute has some pretty nice parks. The river has boat rides during the summer. 

There are multiple gaming stores. Some nice boutiques. 

There’s some neat architecture and history.

"It sounds like you guys are starting off with some good ideas. Consider adding decorative trees (perhaps in roadway lane dividers as these always look nice?). Better lighting is a given... I'd also try to see if it's possible to have consistent trash baskets along walkways and (obviously) do something about the graffiti, broken lights and or broken windows, etc. Depending on how much money you guys have or get from any of your grants or other handouts, it might be worth looking into a new park area with a nice fountain that people can sit down by and relax at (or something along those lines to bring nature a little more into that area--something 12 Points might benefit from, especially given the pond area it has near Fort Harrison).

I'd also see if it's possible to implement some form of security, something 12 Points is desperately in need of. Not sure how or what options exist to do this but it's needed.

As for business ideas, well, there's no shortage of those... We obviously need better employment in the area (Terre Haute in general needs that!) but I understand that the kinds of employers we all wish for come in increments... So what would be some ways to incentivize business relocation into that area? First, you'd need / want to inventory what the area's strengths are: 12 Points doesn't have a lot but it does have plenty of sidewalks and potential for sidewalk retailers or foodies. So, think ""sidewalk setups:"" I'm envisioning actual cafe-like things with seating along walkways or else street stands and or other non-traditional configurations you'd see where people spend a lot of time walking around. On a somewhat related note, any ways that exist to get rid of the old and tired low-class rummage joints is a definite plus: we have too many of these and too many of them sell junk, too. Given the sidewalk culture we see in that area, it would be nice to see some low-key (and live) band setups. Not sure how that could be done but sidewalk music with foodies and whatnot come to mind here.

Hope this helps.",t2_iiquk,Elminster_Aumar,0,1555096365.0,0,t1_ekqobs5,ekqobs5,True,[deleted],t3_bcgol5,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrehaute/comments/bcgol5/12_points_suggestions/,12 Points suggestions,/r/terrehaute/comments/bcgol5/12_points_suggestions/ekqobs5/,8,r/terrehaute,0,8

"Apartments are hit or miss in Terre Haute. I feel they are all overpriced for what you get and not “high end” or “luxury living” as they advertise.
 I would recommend cobblestone, sycamore terrace, or heritage trail apartments if you are looking for an average apartment complex type place. 
I do not personally know how they are, but near ISU two or three new apartment complexes have recently opened and are supposedly nice with one directly on the river called River Front Lofts. The others are probably geared more so to student housing.  
For a high end apartment the only one I can think of that Terre Haute truly has is called Haute Maison at 7th and Ohio downtown. I would imagine it is at least double your budget from what I have heard. 
Your money will go farther if you purchase a house. We moved to Terre Haute 3 years ago and could not justify paying rent in these apartment complexes and ended up purchasing a house. Home ownership cost are way lower here than average where as we felt apartments were average to above average in cost. 
For the most part any house in your budget will be in an ok area. I do not feel Terre Haute has a good area for young professionals in general. If children are in the future I would recommend looking in the south side of town as the schools on the south side are supposedly better.

"I grew up in and around Terre Haute, and still have family there.  It is a very blue collar town in terms of housing prices.  You'll find many of the larger houses near campus are used as rentals during the school year, but it really depends on what you're looking for.  $1100 can get you quite a bit.

The Farrington Grove district has historic homes, located between Poplar (N)/Hulman (S)/ 3rd (W)/ and 9th (E) if you're looking for older, but potentially larger homes for cheaper.  But they may have been heavily used by college kids, so beware there.  Also, you may live next door to a rental that throws parties, which isn't awesome at times.

Something like this is beautiful (to me) but a lot of maintenance if you really think about it.

South of Wabash is where I would definitely start.  The ""Avenues"" north of campus were pretty rough for as long as I remember.  Once you get south of Springhill and Wal-mart near Ivy Tech, there are subdivisions and houses, but it depends on how far out you want to live.

"You've got some good replies on restaurants but no-one has mentioned J Fords Black Angus. It's another upscale steakhouse that's in a historic old building downtown and has a ton of charm and ambiance. It'll run you about $50-$60 per person on average depending on what you order. Obviously would be more if you have wine with dinner but they have an awesome selection of wines and spirits as well. 

As others have mentioned there's quite a few nice parks in the area with Dobbs and Deming on the East side probably being the most popular parks followed closely by Collett Park up North which is sorrounded by a neighborhood that is one of the oldest in the city and features some of the coolest old homes in the area. 

If you're trying to decide where to live the East side of town is probably the nicest area and where most of the money in town is concentrated. There's other pockets for sure but overall I would say the East side of town is the nicest area on average. The down side to that is that real estate on the East side is expensive right now (relatively expensive, anyway) and houses go pending in just a couple days if they're priced reasonably. Not quite the Bay Area housing market but it's pretty tight right now. Not sure what your housing budget is but you can get a pretty nice place on the East side for under 200k. 

As others have mentioned downtown has had a bit of a resurgence and can be a good time although I'm not really into the bar scene too much anymore. Used to spend a ton of time at the bars down there and always enjoyed it and never had too many problems with assholes. 

If you're into boating like me there's  Mill Creek that's just a short drive over to Marshall Il and Raccoon SRA that's about a 45 min drive up north just past Rockville. The lake you're leaving in Monroe is better than either of the two I listed above but they're solid lakes that are plenty of fun to get out on. On that note... If you're up north check out  Turkey Run State Park. About the same drive as driving to Raccoon. You can go tubing down the creek if you want or you can just walk the trails which offer some of the coolest hidden gems the state has to offer. 

You'll hear a lot of people bad mouth TH but I honestly don't understand it. I think most of those people would complain regardless of where they lived. TH has shitty areas without a doubt but aside from the Carmel area north of Indy I haven't been anywhere in the state that doesn't have their trouble spots. This place like all others is what you make of it. If you focus on the bad and aren't motivated to get out and explore and meet people it's gonna suck living here. But if you're willing to put in some initial effort this place can be a pretty nice spot to call home. Best of luck.

"There are so many good places to eat although most places are chain restaurants. There is also an Aldi being built on 46 next to the Meijer. 

As far as outdoor activities go, if you're into mountain biking and BMX, Griffin Bike Park located south of town is absolutely amazing. They have numerous pump tracks and trails to ride for all skill levels. Another golf course is Hulman links, located east of town south on Chamberlain Rd past Rose-Hulman, and Mark's Par 3, also located on Chamberlain Rd but north of US 40. Hulman will run close to $20 per round but I always loved walking around Mark's for $6 during twilight hours. 

Favorite restaurants are definitely Real Hacienda (the one on Wabash), Taco Tequilas, Chava's, J Gumbo's, Terre Haute Brewing Company (for both their food and their in-house beers), Cackleberries (dynamite breakfast place but they usually close at 3pm I think), Twiggy's, Spaghetti and Sub House, and Royal Mandarin. 

I know if you like running there are numerous groups around town who do 5k, minis, marathons, 100 Mike races, and other extreme events like those. 

Good bars would be Terre Haute Brewing Company, the Bally if you're into the partying scene ($1 wells on Thursdays), 7th and Elm (also $1 wells but on Tuesdays, and trivia Thursday), Sonka's Irish Pub (Guinness on draft and trivia Thursday evenings), The Verve, and Copper Bar. 

Terre Haute doesn't get as much credit as it deserves because it really is a fun place to live. Sure, there are some rough parts of town but every city has those areas. Enjoy!

"There really is quite a lot to do in Terre Haute, so make sure to enjoy the amenities, especially if you have kids. The Children's Museum is excellent and Terre Haute's schools, especially the high schools, are very good for what you would expect of a town this size and wealth. Similarly, the library and the parks, especially Deming Park (up north) and Deming Park (down south), are well kept and  enjoyable for kids and adults alike.   

If you like golf, we've plenty of courses, at Rea Park, Idle Creek, and the country clubs. There are several other museums besides and the downtown is more booming than you might expect with lots of shops offices and restaurants. The most popular places for fine dining are Umi Grill, a sushi place, Tokyo, another sushi place, and Stables, a steakhouse. As you might expect in a rural-ish area, there is a wide selection of churches, in all sizes and denominations. There are two hospitals, Regional and Union, with Union typically being the more commonly used one and it takes care of most of those who come in without insurance or money. If you're interested at all in going back to school, there are four colleges in town, St. Mary of the Woods, Indiana State, Rose-Hulman, and Ivy Tech,  primarily women's, state-public, private engineering, and community colleges respectively.  

A new Aldi's just opened on 41 so if you're into cheap but high quality food I'd highly recommend shopping there or, for even higher quality but higher prices as well at Fresh Thyme.  Getting a Sam's Club membership can be a good investment if you want to buy in bulk. There are several locally owned groceries as well that might serve you well if you want to be more conscientious about where you buy food.  

Don't be afraid to use the bypass when you can. It makes trips a lot faster oftentimes across town because 41, which runs through the middle of town, is always full of semis and the speed limit is necessarily much lower than on the bypass. There is currently a bunch of construction on seventh street so avoid driving on it for long stretches at the moment. Expect construction to be a pretty regular thing. Terre Haute is in a period of growth.  

The people all around are very friendly and courteous so never be afraid to talk to neighbors or even just strangers you meet. They'll always be certain to want to help. Let me know if you'd like more information, I'm sure I could think up more, especially if you have kids, as I'm knowledgeable about the school system and entertainment for kids, but I'm sure your wife will remember enough of town to get you started. Good luck in all your endeavors in this new town. It's a lovely place to live.

This.  I've been railroaded when heading to work at 6am and when driving home after midnight.

"I grew up in Terre Haute....and did all sorts of Urban exploration in my day.....I basically know all the good spots haha. The train trestle off 1st street near the overpass is a really cool spot. Vagrants sleep in the wooded area on the other side. Be careful though, trains do still use that bridge on occasion....but there is a pretty nice platform beneath the tracks about halfway over.

The old Icon building was awesome. It was a massive empty warehouse with multiple stories. Of course it's being remodeled and turned into housing now.

I was lucky enough to have gone into the Terre Haute House too before it was demoed. Used to be a lot of great Urban Ex potential back in the day but the city is really starting to grow and clean up.

A few other notable spots are the tunnels beneath ISU. There is an unlocked entrance hatch near the butterfly garden. It's really awesome...super warm down there though haha....there is also a roof access stairway nearby off 7th street down the street from the Catholic church there.

The area under the Fruitridge overpass is really awesome too....might find some homeless people though. If you are driving there is a semi scale behind Jadcore you can drive up on and weigh your car....or yourself...it's really sensitive.

Could also go into the sycamore building during business hours and ask if they'll take you to the top...best view in Terre Haute by far. There is an old lady there who manages the building and she's almost always down for a trip up.

There is a stairwell behind the AT&T building off of 7th and poplar....the door at the very top is unlocked (for some reason?)......but you can get in there....there isn't much inside....easy roof access.

One thing I will say when it comes to restaurants of an evening: plan ahead a little. For all that there are a ton of restaurants, the wait times are impressive.

"There's 3 Anytime Fitnesses in town. One down South, one downtown, and one on the East side. They're great in that they're always open and usually not incredibly busy but as far as I'm concerned only the South location has a decent freeweight selection and none would be great for powerlifting. On that front I've heard Terre Haute Fitness (which is also 24hrs) is more geared towards power lifting and is incredibly cheap with no contracts but it's also a ""no frills"" type of place. Old weights, sketchy neighborhood etc.. There's another gym called Barrets Gym across the street from North High School but I have no idea what that's all about. Lastly we have a YMCA that has a decent free weight room but I didn't care for it because they're hours didn't jive with my schedule. For that reason I use Anytime Fitness. Oh..almost forgot, Union Hospital has a fitness center on the top floor of their professional office building. I worked out there for about a year back in '09.

"Sonka's is away from campus on wabash and 14th. It's quieter and a little more expensive but not a traditional college kid bar. Better with a small group of friends/classmates.

Copper bar and the verve are both on wabash by campus and are good hang out bars. Verve has live music pretty regularly but can be loud.

Ballyhoo is a college kid bar with dj and dancing. Loud, dirty, chance for hooking up or vomiting from watery well drinks is high. Can be fun, can be lame as hell if you paid 5 bucks to get in and no one is there.

7th and elm... just doesn't really have an identity. Good craft beer there. Go in and ask for Max, he's quite a character and runs the brewery portion. Otherwise I feel like it can't decide if it wants to be quiet for older folks or a college bar.

"I currently live at Sycamore Terrace and am very very happy with it, and the apartments are really nice.  We have a garage and granite countertops, also the master bathroom has two sinks if you're into that kind of thing (I live in a two bedroom with a roommate).

They pretty much always come to fix (non-critical) things within 4 business hours.  Also all the office people I've dealt with are very nice.  They only one I didn't really like doesn't work there any longer.   Also it's nice not to have to deal with the city of terre haute for sewer bills; they're pretty terrible. I think it's safe here, I take walks around here from around 2-4am around here and feel safe.  I don't bring any kind of weapons and I look intimidating either.

Personally I think the location of Sycamore Terrace is much better than Heritage Trail.

There's also Cobblestone Crossings, but that is on the south side and about a 15-20 minute drive from here.  Based off of stores and stuff I think the location might be better Sycamore Terrace, but it's much farther from school for me.  Also they seem to have a much larger range of apartment styles/price ranges, but I haven't actually checked.

Let me know if you/she has any other questions about Sycamore Terrace (or Terre Haute in general), I'd be happy to answer them.  Also I think there's a $250 referral discount to both sides, so let me know if she decides to move here!

Edit: Added some stuff above and I forgot to mention, at Sycamore Terrace it's mostly college students (Rose and ISU), some families, and some older people.  But there's no trash like there was when I lived at Village Quarter (I'm guessing since the rent is higher).",t2_fqqwv,ElmerJFudd73,0,1504580566.0,0,t1_dmkrlb0,dmkrlb0,True,buzymom3,t3_6y3xfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrehaute/comments/6y3xfe/apartment_recommendation_please/,Apartment recommendation please,/r/terrehaute/comments/6y3xfe/apartment_recommendation_please/dmkrlb0/,2,r/terrehaute,0,2
"The Deming is great location, but the cost of rent is higher, so if she's willing, it's totally worth it! I'm not sure how pet friendly the building is, but she can walk the dogs along the sidewalks in town and on the green space at the university when she's short on time or looking to make friends. She will probably have to drive to larger parks for the dogs when she gets the chance (maybe 5-10 minutes by car) but I think it's worth it and shouldn't be a problem. 

Actually, the Deming is right in downtown (what there is of it) and is located on the one block that separates university and the main drag. Lots of bars, and a few local restaurants will be within walking distance and it's one block from the university, so she would find out quickly that she won't be needing her car nearly as much! If she's lucky, she might even be able to pick up the Wi-Fi from ISU.

Since its so close to the university, there is great security and it is absolutely well lit. I think this is an excellent choice, especially if she wants easier opportunity to grow a social network. From the outside it looks clean and edgy and looks like a really nice building to live in. Probably has higher noise levels than the other two, but what else can you expect in the location...",t2_dmi4s,benasw33,0,1504571904.0,0,t1_dmkl29k,dmkl29k,False,buzymom3,t3_6y3xfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrehaute/comments/6y3xfe/apartment_recommendation_please/,Apartment recommendation please,/r/terrehaute/comments/6y3xfe/apartment_recommendation_please/dmkl29k/,1,r/terrehaute,0,1

"Both locations are well lite and in safer parts of town. Both locations are not within walking distance to the little night scene that exists. 

ST is a newer complex that is next to Wal-Mart, Meijer, and a small strip mall (dollar store, shoe store, tanning salon, pizza place, Mexican restaurant). It's literally 2-3 minute drive right off the I70 exit, so, I guess it's convenient.

Heritage trail does have a few college students and young professionals, as I'm sure so does ST. It is close to the ISU football stadium and within 5 minutes to Deming Park (largest park in the city), rual king, Kroger, goodwill, fast food, coffee, and so on. 

Neither has the best of views or prime location. But overall, both are equally comparable and in my eyes equally safe. I would pick heritage trail if I could only pick one of the two because, 1: it has more stuff to do in the same driving radius as compared to ST, 2: it is 5-10 minutes closer drive to downtown/ISU campus and at night when I'm tired, it makes a huge difference to me.

"My advice is to wait if you can. 

If you go to timewarner.com it will tell you that you can get 60 megabits per second down for $45 a month and a free modem. When you call them they will tell you that that package is not available yet but you can get 30 megabits per second down for $50/month and a free modem. I asked for a supervisor to see if I could at least get it for $45...Was disconnected...Called back, went through the same process and was told by a supervisor that the extra $5 was for a wireless modem and that they would take it off for a regular modem. That is what they signed me up for ($45 for 30mbps down) after 40 minutes on the phone making sense of it all. They said to pick up the modem at the local office on Wabash Avenue.

 When I went to the local office to pick up the modem, they said that I had not been signed up for a plan and that the best I could get is 15 megabits per second down for $50 a month... and that the modem isn't free. I was pretty aggravated...$10/month for a modem...$15/month for one with wifi. I require internet for my job, so I told them I would take it before the deal got worse. (Ordered a $90 Motorola that will pay for itself in less than a year from Amazon.)

In a nutshell, Time Warner's corporate offices, website, and 800 number is nowhere near aligned with what the local office is doing and selling. The more I talked to Warner Representatives the more the speed offered declined  for a more and more expensive price.

If you decide to, then deal with the local office explicitly and don't bother calling or looking at anything on the website. But I would wait until Spectrum fully takes over locally too.
