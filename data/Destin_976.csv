"I just wanted to chime in on Tops'l manor. My GF and I stayed there on our first Destin trip in early October 2019. We stayed in the eastern most condo building, 'surf club', I believe it's called. We absolutely loved it. 

A few things; no pizza is delivered there. We have a tradition of ordering pizza on the first night of every vacay after flying in. Although our condo had advertisements next to the phone, none delivered. You may want to pick up groceries on the car ride in. There is a locker room on the first floor of the condo buildings and if your condo advertised that it includes beach equipment, this is where it will be located. 

The beach spot is east of where you'd expect it to be unless you pay for the beach loungers and umbrella, so, if your place does come with beach equipment, you have to set it up east of the expensive blue colored rentals.

The water will not be warm, that just comes with this time of year. From my experience, it's a bit chilly even into early May (perhaps longer). 

Make sure to follow the print out rules for your unit, they are serious about it. It's nothing too crazy, but I remember our stating that if you leave any trash at all or any wet towels outside of the washer, this will result in a $300 service fee. 

If I remember anythign else, I'll edit this. We had a great time though. We only stayed 4 days in early October 2019 which wasn't nearly long enough. The water was very warm. We came back for a week in late April/early May 2021 and the water was chilly and we didn't spend much time on the beach. It didn't help that the week we were there it was cloudy and rainy, like,  days out of the 7. It was perfect on the day we left, of course.

"[Link to Article](https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/walton-private-beach-landowners-lose-in-court/)

WALTON COUNTY, Fla. (The News Service of Florida) — A Walton County circuit judge has rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of “customary use,” a concept that has long allowed the public to use parts of beaches that are privately owned.

Judge David W. Green issued a 10-page ruling Monday that turned down arguments by Northshore Holdings, LLC and Lavin Family Development, LLC, which own property along the Gulf of Mexico and contended that customary use violates the state and federal constitutions.

The Florida Constitution ensures public access to portions of beaches “below mean high water lines,” often described as wet areas of beaches. But customary use involves dry-sand areas of beaches above the mean high water line that are often privately owned.

Green pointed to a 1974 Florida Supreme Court opinion that allowed the public to use those areas of beaches. He wrote that he is “without authority to enter a judgment finding the doctrine of customary use as established by the Florida Supreme Court unconstitutional as a violation of the prohibitions against taking of property without just compensation or without due process of law.”

Walton County has been part of a series of legal battles about beach access, at least in part sparked by a controversial 2018 state law that put restrictions on customary use.

David Theriaque, an attorney for Walton County, issued a statement Tuesday that said Green’s ruling “is an important step in keeping the beaches of Walton County free and accessible to residents and guests.”",t2_dacu9fw2,LivinginDestin,0,1648161502.0,0,t1_i1zq0jz,i1zq0jz,True,LivinginDestin,t3_tn7hfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destin/comments/tn7hfr/walton_county_judge_turned_down_an_attempt_to/,"Walton County Judge turned down an attempt to ""Privatize"" beaches owned by developers in the Gulf",/r/Destin/comments/tn7hfr/walton_county_judge_turned_down_an_attempt_to/i1zq0jz/,15,r/Destin,0,15

"Jokes aside... 
I would recommend you to find something inside Sandestin... Everything is nice and you won't need a car. Golf, beach, pools, good food everything close distance.
I you choose Destin I would say Sandpiper Cove which is kinda affordable or the Emerald Grande which is in the highlights of all the action.
A car is not going to be necessary if you stay on any of those...
The two first ones will need an Uber ride if you want to go to Crab Island tho...

"It's not an exaggeration to say that 2-3 people die here a month either trying to swim the channel from crab island to the shore, or getting caught in a rip current in the gulf.

Water temp is subjective.  I had a pool in AZ for 20 years.  My ""I'm not putting my jimmies in the water unit its"" temp was 75.  Right now it says the temp is 65.  If you go to the beach now, and someone is in the water it's 100% certainty they are not from here.

For the emerald water you see on all the postcards you want high tide, the water is coming in from the gulf.  Between now and the end of September there will be a crowd out there on the weekends if the sun is out (and even if it's not there will be some people).

"One thing to think about with Crab Island when there are a fair amount of people out there. Everyone is drinking something: alcohol, soda, water, sports drinks, or a combination there of, and there are NO BATHROOMS.

When the tide is coming in, better to stay on the south end for the fresh water coming through the pass.  When the tide is going out, stay on the North end for the water flowing from the bay back out to the gulf.

Speaking of tides, they make a pretty strong current in the pass.  Be very aware of where you are if you are in your boat, and when at crab island itself, keep an eye on the people that are with you when they are off the boat.  It is a sad fact that people die there every year, usually from getting close the the edge of the sandbar either accidently or deliberately, then they get caught in the current, and drown.

"Water will still be chilly, maybe low-mid 70's but if its hot enough out youll see people in - i generally wait until closer to May when it gets close to the 80's.  Water conditions at crab island have more to do with weather, tide times, moon etc. so try to sync with that if you want to experience the clear blue waters vs. the brown water.

As far as college idiots and tourists - that's what crab island mostly is these days, especially during march/april  spring break time, so if the weather is nice, there will be a decent crowd out there (not as big as the summer time ones but you wont be alone for sure).  Not sure about vendors - but they charge a lot , definitely recommend brining your own food/drinks.",t2_dj0pdiy,HammyHome,0,1647451623.0,0,t1_i0wq244,i0wq244,True,patio_himself,t3_tfmur3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destin/comments/tfmur3/crab_island_question/,Crab Island question,/r/Destin/comments/tfmur3/crab_island_question/i0wq244/,7,r/Destin,0,7

If you are affiliated with a branch of the military, the ITT (Information Tickets and Tours) on Eglin AFB will sometimes have a coupon or discount for pre purchase tickets.

Further, if you are EFMP, let me know and I will give you the EFMP coordinator on Eglin, they sometimes have free tickets (this is usually an annual promotion and not likely to line up with your visit but it's worth asking the question if you qualify).

For one part of the excursion, the kids are hauled down inside the ship for a story telling portion, that area is air conditioned but there are no windows and stuff, so kids prone to motion sickness may get seasick.

"The Henderson is about 20 minutes from Sandestin and 15 from the Harbour. Probably your best bet. The Harbour has all of the water sports rentals so if you plan on going out to crab island or jet skiiing there then SanDestin is a lil too far. You’ll have a lot of fun at the Harbour if that is where you are going to spend most of your time. It’s just two different scenes.

As far as bars, AJS gets super rowdy and Maguires is cool. Places like Boathouse and Red Door Saloon aren’t anything special though. Most of the good eats are around the Harbour as well. 

It would be nice being at the Henderson where you don’t have to rely on the boat to take you to the beach when you want to go.

The rooftop bar and pool is very cool. If you want to rent jet skis go to happy’s watersports at harbor walk. You can also do guided tours to crab island which is a giant sandbar in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico that you can only get to by boat. Happys will tell you how to get there. I don’t really know where there’s zip lining. I’m sure there’s somewhere to do it within an hour. I’m not sure what you mean by zoos. Seafood: affordable - pompano joes.

"Personally I would say Effie. It’s very hip, has a rooftop bar with pool. Lots of party drinking. Great restaurants. Baytowne wharf. About a mile from scenic highway where you have all the beach restaurants etc. Royal palm grill has a free beach bonfire on mondays and fridays FYI. if you have a car your 30 min from 30a which has tons of fun stuff to do. Great restaurants, bars, biking, beaches, etc. however, Effie is in Sandestin so you know. About 20 min east of Destin. 

Henderson is without a doubt the nicest hotel in Destin. If you’re looking for more of a “resort” this definitely has more of a resort vibe. Great pools, great restaurants. Hot tub. Spa. But it’s very family oriented. Not to say you won’t see people drinking there, but It’s more of a family hotel whereas Effie is more “hip”. Hope this helps.

"From my experience, not a lot of people stay in the room when they come down for vacation. For instance, most of my condos units are really nice and upgraded inside, and people pay $3-$4k a week for them…but spend most of their time either on the beach, in the pool or out and about in Destin. Aside from Emerald Grande and Henderson, everything else will be more like a condo style. If you wanted to stay further down (towards Miramar Beach/30A area) they have the Sandestin Resort. I hear it’s very nice. It was our direct competition when I worked at the Henderson. 
If it were me, I’d go the cheaper route, whether it be a hotel or condo, and spend the money on actual excursions and getting out and enjoying the things.

"I work at a condo here in Destin, and can say the prices you posted are decent tbh. As a previous employee of The Henderson (resort, not Inn) it’s a decent place. The pools are nice, you have beach access, but the beach chairs are stacked in rows and you have to pay for them. It’s not really a 20’s drinking scene, but there is a little bar area inside, it used to have live music and played sports on the TVs, wasn’t horrible overall. The Inn is nice because it’s adults only, so no dealing with all of the kids. It’s almost much smaller, so WAY less crowded. 
A few people have said Destin Harbor, I’d agree. You’re close to food, bars, boating, excursions. Public beach access is an option, just not necessarily walkable.

Please consider that we are people and our time has value.  Google has the answer to all the questions you seek.  This will also apply in a few weeks when you ask us what are the best restaurants.  Locals are both less likely to swim and less likely to go to touristy restaurants than tourists.  Also we will not tell you recommendations on restaurants ""where the tourists don't go"".

We usually just rent cruisers from Big Daddy's bike shop. You can ride to the small town of Seaside and have lunch on the beach. It's the town where The Truman Show (Jim Carrey movie) was filmed.

Make sure you visit Destin. You should walk the harbor. It's close to the Destin Bridge and you can walk the bridge itself. It's the best free view in the whole area. Near the bridge is a legendary Irish pub and brewery called McGuire's that has great food and enormous portions.

"Is a military town that started half assedly as a tourist town. Is NW Florida so is a redneck riviera. If you drive down, then expect not to drive much once here as traffic in summertime is exacerbating.        
On the island, or beach is decent. There is a Publix just over the bridge and there are oodles of restaurants on the island/beach. Best place to eat seafood in my opinion is Gulf Coast Seafood, on Hwy 98 in town, They will steam almost anything bought for you while you wait, is quite delicious.       
Stewbys is also good.     
The place really is not bike friendly, is doable. In summertime is traffic and more traffic.     
Stuff to do, Visit the USAF museum, is pretty nice. Take a ride/walk downtown and have a look at the Indian Mounds.    
For some really good food, try Magnolia Grill . Is on Brooks St, and has some history also.

"Beach is chill.  Far less crowded than other local beaches.  
It is not very bike-able in my opinion.  You can walk to AJ's Shanty or Fubar on the Island with a short walk, or The Gulf a little further, or the Boardwalk (a handful of touristy sites) a little further than that.  
Downtown FWB isn't bad, and is way more relaxed than Destin.  Plenty of bars & restaurants.  You can technically walk that, but it is a few miles each way.  
If you want a party, Destin any night or FWB on the weekends will get you there.

"Clarity at crab island is not dependent on the time of day.  It is dependent on the tidal cycle.  The closer you are to high tide the better it looks, and the closer you are to low tide, the grungier it looks.  It is just because of the water clarity in the gulf vs the bay.

"Stay anywhere from the 'Destin Commons' and west. The Palms of Destin is a good place to stay, and in a great location, they also have a outdoor pool and bar downstairs.

Coyote Ugly (that's the most party type bar in town), AJs, Red Door Salon, Boat House Oyster Bar, McGuires, and Luckys Rotten Apple (they usually stay open till 4am. The others close at 2 ish. My favorite place in town is Mcguire's Irish Pub. They have awesome steaks. But pretty much everything on the menu is big portions and tastes awesome. Boshamps Seafood is good too. For lunch on the beach I recommend The Crab Trap Destin, or Pompano Joe's. Both are on scenic hwy 98. Both are good local seafood (pompano Joe's is a bit better) and both have beach bars out back. And both are right on a public beach access. Probably the most popular ones too. There are 3 strip clubs out on okaloosa island. Red Rose, mostly people of color there. Sammy's Gentlemen's Club, and Club 10. Uber's are also out pretty much any time night or day until about 3AM. It gets pretty spotty after that so dont get stuck 6 plus miles away at the strip clubs.

"Most people have answered most of your questions, so I'll just tag on:

* Like everyone's saying, traffic will probably be a little rough. Please don't forget to use your turn signal, and I'd recommend glancing over your route through town before hitting the road. There's some recent road construction, so you don't want to be watching your phone Maps and the road simultaneously for your exit, and figure out that you have to jump across three lanes to take your turn. There's a reason people make fun of drivers in Florida - pretend like everyone's trying to kill you, and you'll be fine. I would recommend a dash cam if you're driving your own vehicle.
* It'll probably be crowded; even though spring break ends around the first week of April, a lot of older people take the time between the end of spring break and the beginning of ""season"" (end of may) to come down. However, it's been weird recently, so it's hard to guarantee anything.
* If you want to go to out to eat: you are going to want to make a reservation, or at least call ahead day of to see if one is necessary. You would not believe how often I had to deal with tourists coming into the restaurant at the busiest time of night and getting upset because the restaurant was on a wait.  Also, be cognizant of the weather, as that affects wait times, too; if it's a beautiful day that suddenly turns rainy, you might be inclined to go eat to wait out the rain. Just remember that everyone else who is visiting will be thinking this same thing.
* Family ideas: 
   * Henderson State Park is a beautiful beach with a nice play area and some cool, short ""trails"" to walk along and see local coastal flora and fauna. Grayton Beach State Park is similar, but larger and on the east side of Destin.
   * Axe throwing ranges in Destin and Fort Walton Beach. I prefer the FWB range, The Ratchet Hatchet, as it's situated on the Strip in Fort Walton (about a 20-30 minute drive depending where you're at in Destin; allow more time if traffic is bad). They take reservations, usually have cool ""deal"" nights, I think they even still do live music once a week. This also puts you in a cool spot on the Strip to wander down, with more restaurants and shops, and a small movie theatre (Suds n Cinema). DeFrance antique store is right there, too, and a killer place for vintage stuff.
   * Back in Destin: the Destin Commons are a major ""hotspot"" with a lot of cool stores, restaurants, and experiences (example, Uncle Buck's is a big bowling alley/arcade that your kids will probably love!). On the opposite side of the highway as the Commons is another couple of plazas of shopping, as well. 
   * Towards the east/Santa Rosa Beach area, Baytowne is a great walkable ""village"" wharf with a lot of cool stores, restaurants, and experiences; I haven't been there in a couple of years, but last time I was there were lots of play areas for kids, a small ""ropes course,"" etc.
   * Right next door to Baytowne Wharf is Grand Boulevard, a higher end plaza/development of more cool stores and restaurants. Very nice stuff here, but definitely on the pricier side.
   * There's a Wild Willy's AdventureZone out in Destin that offers ropes course/goofy golf/arcade games (and I believe they also sell alcohol!). A UV/blacklight indoor goofy golf course opened recently(ish) in Destin that was pretty cool, as well.
   * There's an Indian Temple Mound Museum in Fort Walton Beach for those interested; granted, it wasn't wildly exciting (and I'm actually interested in that stuff), but I didn't get to see everything, so it may be cooler now than it was years ago.

Besides that, there's plenty of activities that you can rent out (parasailing, helicopter tours, cruise boats), and if you're willing to travel a bit, Pensacola is only \~1 hour away to the west, and is a much bigger city.

"If you are coming from Alaska, the water will probably be warm.  If you are coming from Cancun, it's probably cold.

I don't think it's crazy yet in mid-april.  2021 was an odd year where we broke records of how many people visited.  

The restaurants will be crowded.  Eat early, like 4pm early.

The gulfarium is a fun place.  It's like a Discount (with capital D) SeaWorld but the entry price reflects that.  It's definitely worth seeing in my opinion.  They do serve beer and wine.

I've never been but there is a goofy golf in FWB that just kills it, that place is always busy.

If your planning on spending any time at crab island, check the tide charts.  You want to visit a little before and a little after high tide to have the best water.

If the wind is blowing off shore DO NOT go to your condo and get the camping mattress you have the kids sleeping on to use as a float.  You'll find yourself out past the 2nd sandbar thinking you're in a rip current and the locals having the time of their life laughing at you before they send a few (dudes who look to be military) paddle boarders out to rescue you and your 2 grandkids.

"I dj in this area, and if you’re looking to club you have 4 options: 

AJs - a mainstream overpriced club full of top 40 club bullshit music, but sometimes has a decent band. 

Coyote Ugly - full of a whole bunch of jits, decent party music, but shitty vibe when it gets crowded with entitled assholes.

vibe night club - in fort walton (about 10 mins from destin bridge) decent night club but only when they play electronic music. It gets a bit too hood, and instead of dancing, a whole bunch of people just stand around and just watch girls who think they’re hot shit twerk.

The Block- also in fort walton & next to vibe. It’s a karaoke bar, country side, and hip hop side. Lowkey has always been boring to me unless wasted, and the music is god awful in my opinion. 

However if you wanna bar hop, Red door (personal favorite), boat house, harbor tavern on the destin harbor are all good and walking distance. Then you have lucky’s rotten apple across the street that does power hour drink specials… only issue is, it’s gotten pretty ratchet. lol

"None of what you mentioned is a plumbing issue.  Plumbing issues relate to pipes inside or immediately coming out of the walls/foundation.  An electrician would be just as likely to be able to fix anything you just described.  Or a roofer.  Or a chef.  

With that said, a plumber will be perfectly happy to fix all these issues, though they will inflate their prices to do so.  Get a handyman instead.  Or check out Youtube.  You're looking at maybe 50 bucks in repairs.  A plumber will cost you around a grand.

Come on, man.  ""My faucet is leaking, better call a plumber.""  You really think this is what plumbers are for when an entire new faucet is like a hundred bucks and cartridge replacements are 10 bucks and replacement instructions come in the pamphlet?  This is the bare minimum of what homeowners are expected to be able to do themselves.  Replacement costs less than what they charge per hour and is easily within the realm of the most basic of all DIYer.

Like I said, they're going to be happy to do all this for you.  But not as a plumber.  As a human with basic skills such as reading the pamphlet.

"The bright green, really fine stuff is called Junegrass.  Guess when it comes around?  The bigger, seedy stuff comes and goes depending on tide and what beach.  The rental comanies are annoying as hell to everybody but the hotel they are hired by.  This was addressed a couple years ago by Okaloosa County (for Okaloosa Island only) that they could not stop public setup between chairs, in front of rental equipment, etc.  Destin is different and I cannot remember what the rules are there.  If you get out early and set up, they can't do anything about it.  There is a lightweight option for shade in those fabric tent things.  Very litttle frame and they have pockets for sand in the bottom to dold the sides down.  Chairs, I'd buy a couple but not from the beach stores.  Sam's Club uually has some that will hold up at least at least a few seasons and are'nt too awkward to carry.  Most importantly to prepare everyone for a good time would be to accept that there may be Junegrass or other floaties, there will always be sharks in the gulf that do not care for you in the least, and that you'll get our very fine sand in an uncomfortable place or two.

Take regular walks around your neighborhood, or if you live in a spot with mostly rentals, try some of the walking trails on the state park grounds or a nearby neighborhood with permanent residents. I met my closest friend here bc she was ‘that girl I see walking with the dog all the time’.
If you’re not super into the bar scene, try to find some smaller low key restaurants with good community (chiringos, grayton beach seafood are a couple good ones)
Get to know your coworkers and their circles, or if you don’t work maybe get a fun part time job somewhere where you interact with people.
