To be honest he may get defensive at first, so be prepared for that, don’t be accusatory like “this is why you’re not having sex with me is because you like guys” because that won’t help you guys in the long run. Talking about is the most important thing. That being said Grindr is tindr for guys seeking guys. Regardless of if he’s seeking men or women, if you guys are supposed to be exclusive then asking about the app makes sense and that could be your route to talking about his sexuality.

"$10 that supposed ""deep cleaning"" won't actually happen. With what staff? 

This isn't isolated to Detroit or any school district. I personally think that most businesses that have dragged out shorter hours, or service that is somehow different than it was pre-pandemic, have leaned on ""deep cleaning"" as an excuse, but I highly doubt it's happening frequently. 

I can tell you that at Meijer, the stores are still only open 6 am to midnight because they are essentially blocking out that time overnight IN CASE deep cleaning becomes necessary, i.e. there is a Covid-positive employee. Then they already have it available. This has happened at my store way more than you'd think. But they aren't going to alert the public in any way or close the store.

"I lived there for a number of years as a kid and later as an adult, and still have family there. I had mild interest in local politics, but like most residents, not enough interest to commit to running / serving. 

What I think South Lyon has going for it -- for better or worse -- is that the local government has traditionally been **so** ineffective at all but providing basic services and congratulating themselves on not going bankrupt, that it doesn't really matter if there's a small contingent of crazy. There's not a whole lot they can really do. Vote against paying bills? Propose initiatives that the council has neither the authority nor funding to implement? 

I also theorize (and admittedly, could be totally wrong about this) that the proximity to Ann Arbor probably helps temper things a bit.

"Thank you so much for the highly-informed insight. Most people find local politics boring, but since my family has a farm in SL we have always paid very close attention to these things. 

I recall the mayor being a write-in, too. I was surprised he decided to run again, because apparently a small group of residents had been overly critical and downright ugly toward him even though there hasn’t been much activity in the city. (They’re updating the master zoning plan, but everything else has been business as usual.)

My concern is that people are already more divided and antsy. The last thing the small town needs is some QAnon guy - or anyone - openly spewing hate and making the rest of the metro think the area is full of bigots. (The aforementioned city council candidate is one skunk shy of posting swastikas on social media.)

"Comparatively speaking, Milford is infinitely more backwoods. I'm hesitant to say ""ultra-conservative"" because I don't think unwavering dedication to Trump is particularly conservative. Milford is where the Tea Party rallies used to be, as well as where the co-chair of the MI-GOP lives (fun fact: when local kids were marching for equality, she was on Main Street yelling at them to get jobs, and calling them losers).

South Lyon definitely leans conservative, but I'd suggest that voters (particularly in the city limits) are more casual about it when it comes to council, even if the council members themselves aren't. The past few iterations have had so much weird in-fighting that they haven't been able to do much with the imaginary authority they believe they have.

Back when Tedd Wallace and pals were basically the city government, they didn't really do much of anything that had a political bend (and people generally liked it). My suspicion as an outsider looking in more recently was that Glenn Kivell was reasonable but wanted to do things as mayor, and a few loud townies discovered that they might be able to do things too, if they got elected. So the council has been dysfunctional since.

Here's a guidepost: the building formerly known as The Artcraft Shop -- three buildings down from the inexplicably named Grande Trunke -- had been a burned-out shell in the center of town for nearly **20 years**. For fun, look at statements from any candidate who has run since ever, and they all say the same stupid ""I want to make downtown a destination for blah, blah, blah"" as though some college dropouts who get $75/month or so to be on council are captains of suburban planning.

Incidentally, it looks like Hamade was gunning for this year's crown in grandiose Make South Lyon Great Again rhetoric. ""I hope to make downtown an evening shopping & destination spot for South Lyon & surrounding communities as well as develop incentives to attract business investment in the commercial & industrial districts."" Industrial district? You mean the tube mill? You gonna propose a tax abatement in hopes the new owners don't go bankrupt like the old owners -- the same way that didn't help the old owners, or the old-old owners? Good luck, my dude.

I might be remembering this wrong, but I think the current mayor got his first term as a write-in with name recognition because nobody else wanted to be mayor at the time, and his family has lived in South Lyon for decades. I see Jennifer Redfern wants a crack at it as write-in this year, and has managed to gain support from friends and family who can't vote for her, judging by the signs in New Hudson and Lyon Township, so that's... something.

But anyway. Yeah, there are going to be some QAnon-loving racist kooks in any town.

"With the criteria you mentioned, it seems like Oxford would be the opposite of what you're looking for. It's on the edge of rural, conservative, a far drive from live music, restaurants, and generally anything artistic.

Agreed Ann Arbor would be great, dependent on your budget. It's more expensive than other areas, but not impossible. ALWAYS REMEMBER: you get what you pay for!

I live in a spot between Southfield and Birmingham called Beverly Hills. I love it because it's got all the amenities of Birmingham (rich area), like schools, library, activities, parks, walkable downtown, but it is not quite as expensive. I like living on the border of southfield, berkley, royal oak, oak park, etc. because there is a fair amount of diversity in the demographics that all come together (race, nationality, sexual preference, income, religion, experience). 

Basically along woodward within 3-5 miles east and west, from ferndale to pontiac will be fine; close to parks, food, things to do. Some towns are better than other for schools.

"I'll repeat the ""anyone can run for city council"" line, and add, don't you remember that Jean Cramer racist chick from Marysville a couple of years back? People usually don't vote for wackos, although sometimes one will slip through.

I have family in South Lyon, and drive through it often, as sometimes even stop. I'd always assumed it was a lefty-liberal type of place, because of things like the bicycle paths, the farmers' market, and I've seen other Mach E's there ('cos electric cars are for hippies, except mine, of course).

Unfortunately, city-data only shows political demographics for Oakland County as a whole, but you'll probably glean a lot of information by looking at the remaining demographic data. There are also links to political donations data, so that might give you an idea of who's donating to whom.

"For what it's worth, definitely check out communities between Ann Arbor and Detroit, like Plymouth, MI.  It's a hip little town with very good schools and only a 20 minute drive to either big city and a 15 min drive to the airport.  

I like it especially because I see live music often and for the most part, bigger bands come to Detroit over Ann Arbor. Plymouth has very little crime, but taxes are high. I think homes are probably a little cheaper than Ann Arbor.

" The U.P. is a different world. Its in its own little world up there. Its the most under appreciated land in the country. If you get a chance, Iron Mountain in the western U.P. Its beautiful. T. Falls is damn near haven on earth. 

But you can literally take your pick of what you wana do. In the fall, the weather will be perfect. I mean like hoodie weather perfect. 

 Your getting here a lil late, but it'll still beautiful. You can make a day of jus going for a drive, getting some food in a random city's hole in the wall restaurant and checking out random spots, in random places. 

I don't know how many times I've been bored, and drove up to some random city, got some food and found a lake to jus chill for a lil and go back. 

I mean jus take a drive from Detroit to Houghton or Higgins lake, and tell me it wasn't incredible. If you don't wanna leave the city, we have like 4 metro parks with lakes and/or rivers, and they all have huge wilderness areas, within 20 min of metro Detroit.

If you really wana impress him, takem to a Red Wings game. You don't even gotta be a fan, there's jus something to watching a live hockey game, that gets a hold of you. I can't explain it, but there's nothing like a good, live hockey game in Detroit.

"Honestly it sounds like Ann Arbor is perfect for you. Detroit is more of a city, for singles and younger couples and A2 is a suburb, more for families with students. They're literally 30-45 min away from each other. Be sure to take him downtown during thanksgiving. The lion's play that day, but we suck, so they do a bunch of activities around the stadium to keep people occupied and not so depressed. 

For what you are looking for A2 is perfect. It has everything, literally every thing you named and then some. You want live music? W have so many venues and shows between Detroit and A2. You jus pick the style of music you want, pick the day you wanna go, and what area you wanna be around and go. Every band comes thru Detroit. And if your favorite band is coming they're for sure playing Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland/Cincinnati and you can be in all 4 cities within a few hours. This is Detroit, Rock City, Michigan.

For food, depending on what you're looking for, we have everything. We're not a perennial top 5 for ""plumpest"" population for nothing. Between Detroit and A2 there's probably 10-15 cities that are full of awesome food spots. 

Regardless what you do be sure to check out Dearborn for Arabic food. They have the best Arabic food in America, hands down, no question. It's like 15 min from the airport, and depending on what time of day you go there you can get the freshest food imaginable.

 And if you're into it and coming up here in November, be sure to go up north for a day or 2. It's deer hunting season and its really big up here. 

You should check out Frankenmuth/Birch Run online. I'm sure you'll enjoy a visit there while you're here. Great food and great shopping. If you're gonna be in Oakland county you're not too far from Summerset mall, which is beautiful. 

And overall Michigan is safer than people give it credit for. We have water on 3 sides and our closest neighbor is Canada, and they're the absolute, nicest people. People don't really drive thru Michigan, they come to Michigan. So we don't get any of those crazy highway killers and shit like that. 

Its a beautiful state, that still gets shit for things that happened during Reagan, and the 1980s. If you come here you'll see what I mean. This is a top 10 state for natural beauty, top 5 in my opinion, but I'm bias. Come during fall and tell me it's not gorgeous, so I can call you a liar.

"What are you trying to accomplish here? Avoid the fine? Avoid the points? Avoid the insurance increase that might come with points?

It's going to work like this: you'll go to court, the prosecutor is going to make sure you're there before the judge comes in, and that's going to be your chance to plea. Ask for impeding traffic. If he agrees, that's what you'll be charged with, and you're done.

If you don't have the confidence to do this yourself, call one of those attorneys who do nothing but this. Seriously, their career is working with the prosecutor every morning to plea down to impeding traffic.

If you don't want to do either of the above, show up in court, give your explanation, and hope that the judge will dismiss. (Typically, dismiss plus court costs.) If the cop isn't there that day, then your case will be rescheduled to a day when the cop is there. If the cop is there, you'll have to hope that he remembers you, and is willing to help you reduce. The thing is, he's still going to have to either recommend that the prosecutor change to impeding, _or_ hope that the judge will value the cop's opinion enough to dismiss. The judge can't change the charge himself, so he can only consider dismissal (plus court costs!) if the prosecutor isn't on board.

Finally, you can admit responsibility and pay the fine, and take the points, and possibly the insurance rate hit. Then you don't have to go to court, don't have to talk to anyone, and just get on with your life.

Honestly, the court and the township only give a crap about the money. If they cared about enforcement and you weren't being a jerk, you'd've gotten a warning. This is simply a **cash grab**, and you're stuck with the bill. The upside is, they don't really care about the violation per se, and everyone involved is likely willing to let you plea down to impeding traffic, because it's still a revenue generator, and the benefit to you is that it's **not reportable**; this means it's not reported to Lansing or anyone else, and it will never appear on your driving record, and never get to your insurance company.

How you handle it is up to you.

tl;dr: 

- Show up and hope you can get impeding with the prosector.

- Pay a lawyer an extra $100 to reduce it to impeding, along with his other 10 clients that morning.

- Show up and hope the cop will persuade the prosecutor or judge to reduce or dismiss. If dismissed, you'll still be on the hook for court costs, because, **cash grab**.

- Pay the ticket as written and accept the points.",t2_4au44,balthisar,0,1628619580.0,0,t1_h8fteor,h8fteor,True,Dumbidiotmetrodet,t3_p1bast,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetroDetroit/comments/p1bast/advice_needed_traffic_ticket/,Advice needed: traffic ticket,/r/MetroDetroit/comments/p1bast/advice_needed_traffic_ticket/h8fteor/,1,r/MetroDetroit,0,1

You say ok and they'll tell you wait to see the judge/magistrate. The judge will say you agreed to this, you'll say yes, and they'll say ok, go pay the cashier. You go to the cashier and either pay all of it, or set up a payment plan. And you're good. I promise.

"I went to Selden Standard in Detroit for Father's Day. The three different cocktails I tried were weird and honestly pretty gross tasting, but they looked cool.

The food, though. The food was probably the best I've ever had in my five years living here. Kinda on the pricey side, but 100% worth it. I had the roasted asparagus, grilled half chicken with vindaloo marinade, and sausage rigatoni. Everything had so much flavor and was perfectly done. I wish I would've tried this place much sooner.

Aside from Selden Standard, I encourage you to check out some Filipino food! There are three places in the Royal Oak area owned by the same guy and have portions of the menu with Filipino dishes: Edamame Sushi, Edo Ramen, and Little Tree Sushi. Before Fort Street closed down, there was a restaurant inside called Isla, and they've recently opened their own place in Sterling Heights. From a foodie perspective, this is probably the Filipino restaurant I recommend. At any of these places, try the iconic Filipino dishes: lumpia, chicken or pork adobo, calamansi juice, and halo-halo for dessert!",t2_mcooc,chrismiles94,0,1624892104.0,0,t1_h3brd18,h3brd18,True,Character-Shame-4587,t3_o9k6vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetroDetroit/comments/o9k6vz/metro_detroit_foodies/,Metro Detroit Foodies,/r/MetroDetroit/comments/o9k6vz/metro_detroit_foodies/h3brd18/,6,r/MetroDetroit,0,6

I went 3 years ago.

The Car show was cool, if you like Mopar. You'll see some of the old show favorites like General Maintenance, and the Wheelie Truck.

"Clinton River/Paint Creek (clinton tributary) are good and fairly easy to access. Yates Cider Mill on Dequindre is a good spot, but there's a lot of places you can go to fish along both rivers. I think further downstream on the Clinton, it might be more polluted so just catch and release. There are trout and suckers in the river. 

If you want a chill pond-type fishing experience try Firefighter's Park in Troy or Spencer Park in Rochester Hills off John R Road. The latter you have to pay to park at but you might be able to walk in for free if you find somewhere else to park. 

Might be too far away but St. Johns Marsh on the way to Algonac seems like a fantastic fishing area.

"Smooth Jazz V98.7 was the best channel in metro Detroit. The only time I've ever paid for radio was when it moved to 98.7 HD2. But then they got rid of it completely. I wish there was a way to get it back or at least find their playlists cuz they had some gems on that station. Im sorry to rant, but every time i remember how great that station was i get anxious. It was so calming and they had the perfect line ups. It was a smooth jazz station you could actually listen to. But we can't have shit in Detroit. Unless the  Ford's, Illitch's or Dan the man Gilbert own it, we can't have it. I swear the 90s were the golden age of radio in Detroit. 88.7, 92.3, 93.1, 94.7, 95.5, 96.3, 97.1, 98.7, 101.1, 104.3,105.9 etc all had good playlists. We had great radio in Detroit.

"Little Rochester rant: Rochester keeps a tight lid on a lot of the negative issues they deal with. Like many other affluent areas, they opt out of SMART, the suburban bus system, because of fears about ""undesirables"" arriving by bus (never mind the fact that equally affluent places like Troy and Birmingham are okay with SMART & are served by several routes).

There's also been some nasty incidents of discrimination once in a while. Desirable school district for sure, but lots of Trumpers around, and the cops may give minorities reasons to avoid the area. Downtown Rochester is pretty nice & walkable but the surrounding suburbia is pretty dull, forces you to drive everywhere. I'm biased though because I grew up there.

In terms of places that are a bit more central, feature walkable downtowns with activities and have good diversity & schools, plus feature mass transit (which you may not care about, but is probably something nobody else here has considered), I would recommend Birmingham, Clawson, Royal Oak, Beverly Hills, Berkley, and Huntington Woods. Ferndale and Oak Park schools are lousy and getting worse, I would maybe avoid them if schools are a big concern.

I would also recommend Troy (be careful which part - parts of Troy are in Warren Con or Avondale schools which aren't as good as Troy Schools), but they don't really have a downtown. Avoid Macomb County! Very few interesting places to live, very few walkable downtowns, and not many good school districts that are close to Detroit (Romeo schools might be comparable to Rochester schools but that's really far).",t2_8ogxwqsw,tommy_wye,0,1618202750.0,0,t1_gu81dd9,gu81dd9,False,[deleted],t3_kpkzb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetroDetroit/comments/kpkzb9/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/MetroDetroit/comments/kpkzb9/deleted_by_user/gu81dd9/,1,r/MetroDetroit,0,1

"Lamphere District in North Madison Heights has raised their property taxes and when a friend was trying to move by the golf course their prop taxes were going to be 10K a year.

On the other hand, LV apartments are close to Lamphere but always have places available to rent and I couldn't see it being too expensive. 20 years ago there were a lot of drugs being sold and used in that area. I couldn't speak on it now.

"Switched to Wow! after my family and I started conducting our lives remotely and I got a sense of how bad my Comcast connection really was. After a time I noticed some *serious* latency issues, packet loss, and just connections dropping all over the place with Wow!, but only for spurts of time and only with specific connections.

I called Wow! and they denied any issue. I got proof, I took screenshots of the proof. Then they reported to me that they were not allowed to look at my proof as screenshots. They sent someone out. This issue is like 7 months old now. When the worker came out, I printed out my screenshots and demonstrated while the tech was over that there was an issue by showing them exactly where, on their networks and infrastructure, the packets were being dropped.

So, just to get them to admit that there was an issue, I had to do a tracerout... in front of a tech, identify where the loss was occurring between my laptop and different servers in the world, research who owns the IP address of the server that is failing, find out who owned that company... it's Wow, and provide that info to the tech. Edit: I also had to teach the tech how to read the results here. Basic stuff like ""Reverse DNS"" and tracerout. Just... absurd.

WTF. I did their job for them on so many levels. I'm a therapist. I have zero training in this shit, I tinker as a hobby. I also need my internet for work on a very non-trivial level.

The tech told me that there is no way to fix the issue, no system in place to address this from their side, and that I should expect some more outages as they are ""updating infrastructure"" in the SE Mich area. This was like.... a month ago or so.

Anyway.

Of those Downtowns will be Northville, Birmingham, Grosse Pointes. But if 'good schools' are good enough, you also have Ferndale, Royal Oak, Berkley, Farmington with also viable Downtowns & Schools.

Now diversity is the tough part.  Detroit is close to 80% African American, and most suburbs are 80% Caucasian.  You'll find most diversity in Novi, Farmington Hills & Southfield.

But all of the above can be easily disputed by anecdotal evidence and personal opinion. A little hard in the middle of a pandemic and lockdown, but I'd say get out, go to restaurants. Talk to your friends. There are so many neighborhoods in metro Detroit, and so many personalities.

"Just my own opinion but from my experience it seems that the tiny added cost, if any at all, compared to the convenience and use you get from a basement make having one totally worth it. They contribute so much w little negative draw. Seems water is the basement's enemy but these days most houses are equipped to deal w it or easily modified to do so. Pitched floors, functioning drain lines, drain dumps, and pumps are keys. It only takes one freak incident to lose everything within a foot of that basement floor but w the above items in place the loss and damage are significantly lessened. Perfect example of that ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure. To make the values a little more accurate I'd say a gram of prevention is worth a kilogram of cure.

"I've lived in a house on a slab, and in a bi-level, and there are some downsides. 

The biggest one (besides the storage you get with a basement) is on a slab, your HVAC is going to take up some space, and depending on where that space happens to be, can make replacement more expensive. In the house on the slab, the previous owners moved the furnace to the attic to win back some space. But the attic wasn't finished, and simple maintenance like changing the air filter meant balancing on rafters so as not to fall through the ceiling. It also meant that central air wasn't happening, and the slab would get pretty cold with the heat only coming from vents in the ceiling.

In the bi-level, it meant that you heard the furnace and central air constantly. This will be the same on a slab, even with a brand new system. 

Plumbing is a similar story. If your drain to the street clogs or gets a root ball and you don't have floor drains like you would in a basement, that water has to go somewhere -- and somewhere is either up the lowest drains, or the drain in your utility room floor... and beyond. If the previous owners did what mine did, it'll also mean figuring out drywall repair when the plumber has to bust through the wall to get to your drain cleanout. 

And if you have (or plan to have) kids, faceplanting on a slab sucks. I don't care how much carpet pad and area rug thickness you have. It sucks.

That all said, because houses without basements aren't as popular, it can put you in a better position as a buyer. When I got my similarly unpopular bi-level, I was able to buy a house that had double the living space as a ranch with a basement. When the time came to sell that house, the smaller house I considered had a much higher increase in value -- but I never would have stayed in it long enough for that to have mattered, because living space was more important to me than the return on investment.",t2_8m0gj,totallyjaded,0,1606380506.0,0,t1_gdn5hk3,gdn5hk3,True,Bluetwiz,t3_k0tw5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetroDetroit/comments/k0tw5q/house_without_basement/,House without basement,/r/MetroDetroit/comments/k0tw5q/house_without_basement/gdn5hk3/,2,r/MetroDetroit,0,2

"I've lived in houses with and without basements, in Michigan. I love having a basement vs a crawlspace, but that depends on the basement in question. Some basements are creepy, buggy, moldy, dark, and generally gross. But if the basement is well-done it's nice, well- lit from the little ground-windows, cool in the summer, and it's a HUGE area added to your living/storage space (especially if you have kids there's so much extra room for toys, hobbies, musical instruments, etc). Note, you can't legally turn a basement into a bedroom unless it has a secondary exit (in case of fire). But for me I love having a basement. The ease of access to pipes and etc is great vs a dirt crawlspace. (Those houses generally have a utility/laundry/furnace room but the pipes are still in the crawlspace usually.) The final thing is I feel so much more secure when thinking of tornadoes, having a basement instead of a crawlspace. This is just my two cents.

I also think that Detroit’s core neighborhoods are also becoming hotspots (downtown, midtown, cork town, eastern market, etc.)  These area have been getting lots of development recently, and if climate change does increase or if people get tired of the heat down south people might consider moving to the Midwest (metro Detroit, and chicagoland mainly)

Metro Detroit’s population is at 4.3 million right now, I think by 2030 the metro will be at 4.5 million and Michigan at 10.3 million. I feel like that Ann Arbor, and Grand Rapids areas are booming in popularity, and since Ann Arbor is expensive af, and most subs over there are practically rural (minus ypsi, saline, and dexter) so if people move in west metro Detroit (novi, Northville, Northville township, canton, Plymouth) they can still have thier A2 job, and then live in the metro area for cheaper housing which will bring up the metros population more.

As of Detroit’s population I have a feeling it’ll decrease again, but not that much though. 2019 estimates are at 670,000 but I think it’ll be at 640,000 after the census, and maybe during this decade we might see population increase since 1950. That all only happened if Detroit gets more jobs, fixes neighborhoods in all parts of the city (w/out gentrifying if possible), and has a more reliable transit system for the metro (hopefully light rail).",t2_63sqxd70,TooMuchShantae,0,1605027630.0,0,t1_gbudtzt,gbudtzt,True,Bluetwiz,t3_iebljq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetroDetroit/comments/iebljq/will_this_pandemic_change_metrodetroit/,Will this pandemic change metroDetroit,/r/MetroDetroit/comments/iebljq/will_this_pandemic_change_metrodetroit/gbudtzt/,1,r/MetroDetroit,0,1

"> Mt Clemens is really cheap, and there’s a little downtown there.

It's the little downtown that tries and fails, and tries and fails. I lived in Clinton Twp. for 12 years, and I tried hard to love Mt. Clemens. Bath Street Bistro is awesome, the Fondue Room was great but faddish and died, and everything else is for the weekday legal lunchtime crowd.

Oh, it also has the only BW3's that I've ever liked. I keep trying BW3's, and am always disappointed, but man, I really, really miss this one. It was usually well run, great crowd, good wings most of the time, and just something that while nice, isn't really part of a downtown scene.

"I am big on walkability and culture—I feel the suburban downtowns are quite limited overall (in regards to practical walkability and variety) with a few exceptions.  I also think it would help a lot to have a better idea of what you’re asking/ looking for.  I agree Royal Oak and Birmingham are priced high by Detroit standards, but I know someone in a nice area of Ferndale renting a (very old, quaint) three bedroom house for less than $1000.  So if you’re excluding even Ferndale prices, which can be quite cheap, then that might be pretty limiting.

Since cost is a consideration, I’m excluding Ann Arbor entirely.  Worth consideration, but all more expensive than Ferndale would be:  Plymouth, Northville, Milford.  I always liked all of those. All those downtowns have a little character, and are nice (in an upper-middle class suburban way).  I’d say Milford is probably the most family-oriented of the three and probably has the least character, but this is probably splitting hairs.  (That said, while I can’t see myself living in Milford by choice, I would certainly give preferential consideration to the former two given the right circumstances.)

Brighton is probably in the same tier as Farmington in terms of price and what the walkable area offers. Which is really not much in my opinion, but it’s also totally fine, it’s something.  Farmington has a lot more cultural variety and is much more centrally located (definitely my preference).  Brighton is probably more “hip” right now in that some of the bars draw a young crowd, but you said you don’t care much about that anyways.

Dearborn is probably around the same price as Brighton and Farmington, but it has a lot more walkable options/variety and character to my understanding—definitely not to be overlooked!

Mt Clemens is really cheap, and there’s a little downtown there.  I think there’s also a couple decent walkable areas downriver these days (Westland, Wyandotte) but don’t quote me on it.

"Northville and Plymouth both have nice, little downtowns.

Northville seems a little larger because of the large park and historic village kind of add to the size of town without densifying it. The only downside is I think they're planning to build a whole lot of apartments when they tear down the horse track, and that tends to bring large amounts of traffic and people that want to enjoy the quaint town, but also destroy it by being there.

Plymouth, while having a small downtown, is bit less elitist in general, although you really have to be in the township for reasonable property. But that's okay, Plymouth city is small and the township line is close.

I tend to see younger folks enjoying the nightlife in Plymouth compared to Northville.

Both Northville and Plymouth are very well located to Hines Drive, should you be a fellow bicycle enthusiast, and there are all sorts of low-traffic roads to the west of both of these.

Ann Arbor is very convenient to Plymouth via both car and bicycle, and although you said you're not looking for the party scene, downtown Ann Arbor has a lot more to offer than any other SE Michigan downtown as far as dining and entertainment, and I'm including Detroit in that.

"I really sympathize with that sentiment, since my gut reaction was that it’s a horrible decision on Whitmer’s part. But I’m unsure after considering the counterarguments. Her administration is worried about…

…which could likely be just as horrible. Both hospitals and nursing homes are overworked and under-staffed… and that’s on a good day. If blame were to be cast, I would also consider laying it on hospital executives and nursing home managers.
