"Quiet and green space are difficult with condos as one of the ideas of a condo for the developer is to put in as many units as possible, often with less land than single-family homes. This eliminates garden-style condos as these usually have a lot of units. A lot of the townhouse-styles have two to six units per building and many are tight on space. Space is an important factor, especially in the winter because we get snow and you have to put the snow somewhere and it decreases the space for driving and walking.

The issues with HOAs are more the rules and philosophy than the fees as these have an impact that can be difficult to change. You may run into a board or set of rules which you really don't like and the only realistic way to change it is to move. I would recommend against a Condex because you and the other owner have one vote each so it can be hard to resolve issues where you fundamentally disagree.

Walkability is generally more correlated with urban settings. It is difficult to find quiet, open space, trees, etc. combines with the ability to walk to services. It is generally difficult to get around Nashua without a car unless you live in the downtown area, perhaps near the heavy retail district in the south or some of the places along Route 101A.

I think that Heron Cove in Merrimack would give you the quiet, green space and trees. They are detached 2-bedrooms homes. It is a senior community though and you can't walk to shopping/pharmacy. I don't know of anything similar in layout and style to Heron Cover in Nashua, There is a community like that in Hudson that I'm aware of but I think that it's also a senior development.",t2_4o6lv4vj,movdqa,0,1647515817.0,0,t1_i106vai,i106vai,False,[deleted],t3_tfttmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashua/comments/tfttmu/condos_in_nashua/,Condos in Nashua,/r/nashua/comments/tfttmu/condos_in_nashua/i106vai/,1,r/nashua,0,1

Rambling House and TaleSpinner also just opened downtown, they have a reasonable if fairly by the books beer selection, nothing standout. Fair warning that their food is pricey tho.

We are at the end of our leash. We talked to the loft property manager on Sunday, he only had an opening for May.

Sadly, because of the housing crunch and the cost of building materials sky rocketing, most apartments have turned to garbage. (I can say this with conviction because I work in the PE space and my company is in the same predicament)

"Congrats! 

I usually go to Smoker’s Haven for vape supplies - I have a Sourin Air Pro and get a cartridge every two weeks or so. Do you have that in stock? I guess it’s a kind of rarer vape. 

I was just reading about how their owner was fined $50k for failing to pay overtime pay to 5 employees and retaliating against them. Put a bad taste in my mouth and don’t really want to support that guy anymore, so your post is well timed. 

Another question - are you planning on selling Pax products, or some other similarly well-reputationed dry herb vape? I used the original Pax in ~2014 and would like to save my lungs and get back into it. Happy to take recommendations too.

I'd also avoid apartments in and get close to street named after trees.

The speed has been as advertised, but I've only tested it for actual numbers a couple times. However, I am luckily on the 1gbps plan, so your experience may be different.

They've had a few outages, but then so did Comcast.

Their support seems ok - I've called them twice and didn't wait long.

The only negative is their user account website appears to have been created in 1995 - not just in usability and appearance and such, but even in how it functions.

For example setting up autopay: they needed an entire billing cycle to ""process"" the setup, meaning I had to physically mail them a check for the month _after_ entering the info on their site. I guess they needed to write my info down on a papyrus scroll and send it somewhere via the pony express or by sailing vessel.

In Merrimack, Sweet Ginger is one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to in my life.

For traditional American Chinese food I love Wok n' Roll and Pan Asia, and for pizza we use Nashua House of Pizza, Milano's and Gianni's. All are very different and good.

"Nashua is pretty good now honestly. I’m originally from Dracut and my wife and I bought a house here in 2012 and then moved to the other side of Nashua to another house in 2019. We had apartments for a few years before that in Nashua as well. 

For the price, you can’t beat it. You have pretty much everything you need in the city and the downtown has improved so much over the last 10 years it’s unrecognizable. 

The performing arts center will be having national music acts And the city is also looking at bring the commuter rail up here. Once that happens, the housing market will take off in the city and it will start to change. 

The poorer parts of the city have started gentrification as well as services are improving.

Of course the down-side with _not_ raising it right now, is that the current wages are only higher while there are more jobs than applicants.

"If you're going to have your dogs off leash be very sure there's no one else with dogs who will be around. A good time is late afternoon or early morning for minimal interaction with others. Ensure you have EXCELLENT control of your dogs in case someone does show up. LEASH your dogs IMMEDIATELY if someone does come by.

Your dogs may be totally friendly cuddle bears. But other people's dogs may not be. My boyfriend's dog is a sweetheart but if she is leashed and another dog is not and comes up to her she goes ballistic. Leashing is safer for everyone including your own dog. Respect anyone who tells you to control your dog. I cannot count the times we have told someone else to leash their dog and they don't and our dogs get into a fight, when I was following the rules with my own dogs leashed.

You also have to be aware if you have more than 1 dog they will pack up against other unfamiliar dogs. That makes it even more potentially dangerous to have your dogs unleashed as they will be more inclined to attack other dogs.

I would start with commands in your own yard and see how they behave before even attempting offleashing them elsewhere.",t2_badbfxe,booandbecks,0,1637504107.0,0,t1_hliemjs,hliemjs,True,AlfalfAhhh,t3_qy88hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashua/comments/qy88hs/off_leash_with_my_dogs/,off leash with my dogs?,/r/nashua/comments/qy88hs/off_leash_with_my_dogs/hliemjs/,2,r/nashua,0,2

"To answer your questions. Yes, it seems to try to increase the number on the commission from 3 to 5, justification of change seems to be mirroring what other NH cities have and increasing diversity. Correct, the Governor and state Executive Council currently decide who is on the commission, justification of change is that Nashua is the only city that still functions this way in NH and this should be handled locally.

Quick history is that Nashua is the only city that doesn't appoint its own Police Commissioners. This seeks to change that from the governor to the Nashua Mayor and Board of Alderman. The current system has been around 130 years. The Board of Alderman were presented with a motion to add this to the ballot and voted 8-6 against doing so. Local groups gathered the required number of signatures to get it added to the ballot instead.

**Arguments For:**

* Provide local control
* Increase diversity of Police Commission
* Supported by mayor

**Arguments Against:**

* State deciders are more impartial than local deciders
* Initiative doesn't have majority support of Board of Aldermen
* Doesn't have support of current Police Chief and Police Commission
* Allows for commission member to be removed without cause by Mayor and Aldermen

Personal aside: I'm not well versed on the current process of dismissing a member of the Police Commission and don't know if the governor and executive council can dismiss them without cause currently.

**Nashua’s mayors’ rap sheets: No jail time for any of them in 160 years, several scandals**  
By Staff | Nov 10, 2013  
NASHUA – Held up against certain chief executives of cities such as Washington, D.C., Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans and now Toronto, Nashua’s mayors appear to be a historically well-behaved group of public servants whose documented brushes with the law are few and far between.  
But there has been a fair share of scandal among Nashua’s chief executive officers, and a number of them have faced recall as a result.  
While it isn’t yet clear whether Mayor Donnalee Lozeau, her husband, David, or anyone else involved in the ongoing exchange of accusations with the Police Department will ever be charged with a crime, the nature of some of the allegations, including bid-rigging and drug use, are serious. Where the flap will end up remains to be seen.  
As far as can be determined, no Nashua mayor has been charged with a felony or served jail or prison time while in office, or because of something he did while in office.  
The same can’t be said of aldermen, however; at least three – Thomas Magee, Philip Grandmaison and Steve Kuchinski – did stints in prison after being implicated in a 1993 scandal that involved peddling influence, mail fraud and extortion.  
The mayor at the time, Rob Wagner, wasn’t involved in the scandal.  
But Wagner, who served one term from 1992-95, did have to defend himself against a recall effort, one of four launched against three mayors between 1978 and 2005.  
Former Mayor Bernie Streeter is another recall survivor, having prevailed in a 2005 recall initiative brought by former Alderman Claire McGrath.  
But Streeter is also remembered in the legal arena for his October 2004 arrest in Manchester, in which he was initially charged with a misdemeanor for leaving the scene of an accident.  
The minor crash, which involved Streeter’s city-owned Crown Victoria and a Queen City Taxi cab, prompted the drivers to have words, during which Streeter asked the cabbie the now famous question, “Do you know who I am?” as he pointed at his government license plate.  
Several months later, Streeter agreed to plead no contest to a violation-level charge of conduct after an accident in exchange for a $1,000 fine; paying Queen City Taxi about $1,100 in restitution; writing a letter of apology to the cab driver, Eddie Mercier; and completing 50 hours of community service at a Manchester nonprofit agency.  
Five months later, Streeter had wracked up 82 hours of community service at three agencies – Manchester Head Start, Girls Inc. of Manchester and the Manchester branch of the Lil’ Iguana Children’s Safety Foundation.  
Later in 2005, Streeter got caught up in something of a whimsical scandal brought to light by then-Alderman-at-Large Paula Johnson. On a Saturday morning, Johnson whipped out her cellphone and began recording when she happened to notice Streeter dropping his personal trash bags into a Dumpster behind City Hall. No illegal dumping charges were ever levied against Streeter as a result of the short-lived episode.  
Longtime City Hall presence Donald C. Davidson, who filled out the final year of Mayor Dennis J. Sullivan’s third term after Sullivan resigned in 1977 for health reasons, holds the distinction of surviving two recalls, although the first came about when he was Board of Aldermen president and acting mayor.  
The attempt in 1992 to recall Wagner, a relative unknown who edged Davidson 50.9-49.1 percent in the 1991 runoff election, was abandoned shortly after its author, beleaguered taxpayer Matthew Gillis, launched it when Wagner refused to grant Gillis’ request to reopen the recently adopted city budget.  
Meanwhile, allegations of an attempted power grab by then-board President Davidson sparked the initial recall effort, which, he said later, drained him severely physically and emotionally.  
It began when Davidson’s critics claimed he was behind a July 1977 change in the city charter that would automatically make the board president the acting mayor in the event the sitting mayor resigns or dies in office. Previously, the charter stipulated the board would choose, by vote, a sitting alderman-at-large to fill the vacancy.  
So when an ailing Sullivan resigned on Aug. 12 – just three weeks after the new provision went into effect – Davidson, as board president, added “acting mayor” to his resume.  
Inflamed by what they saw as a Davidson power play, a group of critics drew up what could be Nashua’s first-ever recall attempt of an elected city official. The recall provision was added to the city charter in 1913, and removed shortly after Streeter’s recall attempt in 2005.  
Davidson eventually gave up challenging the petitions, setting the stage for an unusual municipal election that featured the president of the Board of Aldermen trying to muster enough votes to prevent his removal, while also battling two challengers – Edward Carter and Leonard Dobens – who sought Davidson’s seat.  
“Pulling victory from the jaws of recall” is how then-Telegraph City Hall reporter Claudette Durocher began her next-day story about Davidson’s convincing, 4,785-3,120 victory over second-place Carter.  
Meanwhile, former Alderman Maurice L. Arel was in the process of defeating Alice Dube in the 1977 mayoral race, preventing her from becoming the city’s first woman mayor, thereby saving that distinction for Donnalee Lozeau some 20 years later.  
Arel faced scandal, but after his time as mayor.  
He held the city’s top post until 1984, except for a period in 1980 when he ran for Congress but lost badly to fellow Nashua native Judd Gregg. In 1984, Nashua water company Pennichuck Corp. courted Arel to become its CEO, and he accepted, abruptly resigning his post as mayor.  
Under Arel’s leadership, Pennichuck’s core business grew, as did its profits as land was sold off for development along with the real-estate boom of the 1980s.  
Arel was eventually sanctioned after a two-year state and federal probe concluded he and his son personally profited while he was CEO by steering construction contracts to prominent builder John Stabile. Pennichuck and Arel were fined a combined $390,000, and Arel received a lifetime ban from serving on the board of any public company.  
Arel’s friends and colleagues stood by him through the turmoil, and Arel pointed to his long history of charitable efforts in the community and said he would continue to focus on that.

"> To keep Nashua police and politics separate

Don, it seems like this ballot question would have the police commission appointed by Nashua politicians.  I get that.

What I don't get is why the way it is now, with the Nashua police commission appointed by *state-level* politicians, is supposed to be somehow better.

If the commission has to be appointed by politicians, aren't *local* politicians better than the politician(s) in Concord?

Also, why is Nashua the only NH city left that has state politicians appoint its police commission?

"For southern NH, the only one I found to have any use was [Alexander Technology Group](https://www.bankwstaffing.com/alexandertg/). It looks like they may have merged or been acquired though. I have noticed they operate around Boston too, so they may be worth reaching out to. The person I worked with specifically was a guy named [Dustin Moriarty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustin-moriarty-239b9661/), who seems to still be there and is now listed as a ""Recruiting Manager"". They have an office in Bedford so they may have some leads for you around Manchester, Nashua and Portsmouth like you wanted.

I would avoid Robert Half - they operate around Manchester and are utterly useless IMO. Possible I got a bad recruiter from there though, they are a big name and might be worth working with if you can find a more senior person there. Perhaps someone else can point you in the right direction or will agree with me lol.

For Boston, I worked with a few recruiters that I'm happy to name drop:

* [Kelli McGrath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellimcgrath/) - she got me a few leads with startups. I believe this is the company she works for: [Planet Technology](https://planet-technology.com/). She was awesome to work with. I don't know if she has jobs around NH, but she's worth talking to.
* [Shari Munro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharimunro/?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAHQaoBBxMwkVJFvLc7fbqzgZ-aGMau4Uc) over at [Techpros](https://techprosinc.com/). She also got me some leads with startups and one with Bose I believe but I wasn't quite interested in that role (was more firmware/embedded based and I wanted out of that area).

They seemed to mostly have startup roles, but I also was pretty specific that I wanted a tech company vs the DoD industry that I've found myself in. I just got an offer from a startup I originally connected with on LinkedIn which is why I suggested you try LinkedIn more - there's _tons_ of recruiters on there that will come to you. I've had places ranging from Facebook/Google reach out, to Capital One, Car Gurus, Draft Kings, etc. All Boston based but I set my settings that way. You might find some local companies on there. I know Fidelity is active on there.

Also, I got a few leads from [Hired](https://hired.com/). I tried logging in but it seems they deleted my account after I told someone from hired that I got a job offer. Opps. I remember places like Vonage, Draft Kings, Capital One and a few others reaching out on there.

"There's a bunch and they're all _mostly_ useless IMO. LinkedIn will be your best bet. Turn on the ""interested for work"" setting, mark your location as Nashua, Manchester and Portsmouth and wait for the flood gates to open. I'm a software engineer around Boston with ~4 years experience and I got _flooded_ with messages. ~43 messages the months of June and July and then 188 messages in August. I found a new job so I turned it off, but my guess is I got a 100 messages or so this month too. At your experience and level, you should have tons of messages coming in.

There's not much for bigger companies around Nashua either besides Fidelity and BAE. You'll have a lot more options if you expand towards Boston. Most companies are remote or hybrid/flexible, so you shouldn't have to worry about a commute. Lot's of places around Burlington, Woburn, Lowell, etc that are very easy commutes one day a week.

"Before the pandemic, Parks & Rec's summer concert series and Great American Downtown's street-blocking festivals were doing reasonably well. Smaller venues (notably Riverwalk) were reducing or eliminating their music lineups. Even if they want to play, many smaller groups aren't wanting to do it for tips, and it's \*very\* format and genre dependent. I think the block parties in the Tree Streets set groups up on the small bandstand on Ash Street once or twice per year,

It doesn't help that one is seeing fewer and fewer young people interested in coming out to see live music nowadays.

We had a first floor apartment which was nice but there was also a lot of moisture in it constantly we ended up having to pay for the carpet to be repaired when we moved out because there's so much moisture it sucked some of the dye off one of our bookshelves and stained the carpet also a few of our things that were stored underneath a dresser in our bedroom got some mold on them. 

They were fairly prompt with repairs our water tank started leaking and that got repaired on New Year's Day and our stove started leaking gas so they gave us a temp apartment for one night while they figured it out shut off the gas and then replaced the stove.",t2_7subz,Evil_Superman,0,1628165067.0,0,t1_h7snmgv,h7snmgv,True,itskevinsfamouschili,t3_oy8hue,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashua/comments/oy8hue/boulder_park_recent_reviews/,Boulder Park?

* carne a la plancha : a little tough, but that's probably because it's skirt steak or something similar.  A little too salty for my taste.

* passion fruit juice and milk.  Really nice flavor.  Sort of like a smoothie.

"The city is not big on planning.  I think we still own the decaying warehouse and office building on Burke Street that was intended to house public works and their vehicles, except they realized after purchasing it that it would cost too much.  

You're right about the high schools.  South is right on the highway, there's no residential traffic on that road that would auditorium users would conflict with.  Plenty of parking when school is out.  

The newer North school is in a residential setting which makes it a little less desirable, but still could have worked.  It's not far from the highway.

They keep talking about potentially closing Elm St middle school.  It's not close to the highway, but it's closer to downtown.  Of course that would come with both demolition and construction costs and traffic would potentially be a problem.

"Of course it's an experiment.  There's no evidence to show that it will be successful.  That's the definition of an experiment.  We're not sure what's going to happen.  You suggest it will be successful.  History shows that it will not.

If you're a true lover of the arts, I don't think the seating situation would have stopped you from attending.  The venue still failed.  It wasn't the seating.  What kind of seating do you expect in the future site?  That's not a large parcel of land.  It's not going to be big.

You'll notice for parking, I said ""lazy-people"" distance.  People that go downtown are lazy.  They don't want to park in the garages.  There were even suggestions not too long ago about the city pressuring property owners downtown to let the public use their parking, which of course is insane.  You argue there's plenty of parking.  There is.  People don't want to use it.

Broad Street Parkway has some limited use for a very small number of people.  I've biked along it on different days, different hours of the day.  I never see more than a half dozen vehicles on it at any one time.  Usually, it's just a vehicle or two.  Given the overall cost of that project, it's a disaster.  We could have bought the few users of it their own helicopters and saved money.  It doesn't even have cycle lanes, which is preposterous for new road infrastructure.

Nashua loves wasting tax money.  We need to strengthen the spending cap and only spend money where it's actually needed.  You want a nice art venue?  Get private funding or go somewhere else.  It's not something we should be forcing taxpayers to commit to.  It's not a necessity.",t2_gwhv2,vexingsilence,1,1622662695.0,0,t1_h0co4bq,h0co4bq,False,Datmuny19,t3_nqqoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashua/comments/nqqoon/what_a_great_idea_this_was_huh/,What a great idea this was huh 🤔,/r/nashua/comments/nqqoon/what_a_great_idea_this_was_huh/h0co4bq/,0,r/nashua,0,0
"Disagree

A) I don't see this as an experiment as you've characterized it here

B) I attended many of the shows at that location in the early 90s.  That was a shitty venue for performances and didn't have much seating.  This is going to be a real performance arts center and not a stage in a building designed for not much more than a jr high school talent show.

The parking complaint is a red herring.  There is plenty of parking in Nashua.  For some reason people think that because they can't park in front of the place they need to be that ""there's no parking in Nashua"" and that's just not the case.  There's plenty.

Broad St. Parkway is used plenty.  I use it at least 1/2 dozen times per week.  Depends where you are and where you're going.  I get that people on the south side of Main St. won't use it much but that doesn't mean it's not used.  As soon as it opened, trips from west of Rte. 3 to downtown went from 20+ minutes to 5.

Some of the apartments are really old but most have been redone. Anyone moving in now gets one of those. Also there are deluxe units that are bigger and nicer. It's pretty quiet. Mostly people with kids and middle aged people. The landscaping is nice. Never saw a single bug in the apartment. Hallways vacuumed every week. Not enough washers and dryers. Only 2 each per building. Office manager is a complete bitch but you probably won't have to deal with her much. Maintenance responds fast and the guys are pretty nice. Definitely the best you can get for the price if you want to be in Nashua. Also cats are allowed with no pet fee.

"Just like you said a mask and gloves is perfect for protection. Be sure to keep your gloves and hands clean and change the gloves. 

Most places are opening up to almost normal but they are only at like half capacity for restaurants. Some places have longer lines for drive throughs. Some people have become more friendly while others not so much. But most are just happy to be out and doing things again. 

Keep up on the protection for now the sanitizing has gone way down hill in my opinion but many just don’t care anymore. I’m not sure about your local area but our outdoor mask rules have been lifted here and they are starting to add more capacity for entertainment which is wonderful.

"If you want go south a bit, there is a brand new Market Basket/Demoulas on  Pawtucket Blvd in Lowell next to the bowling alley.

As far as shopping, other than the arrows in each aisle and the spacers in the checkout lines, its really the same. We shop in the same general area and most people are wearing masks and keep good distance. There are always a few that after a year can't figure it out.

Someone mentioned the deli - its full service. Bakeries don't have the cases for you to grab muffins/donuts and there aren't buffets or salad bars.

The stores seem to be cleaner, but they were even cleaner 6 -9 months ago.  Personally, I like ordering from target or home depot and just picking it up outside. So easy.

"Most of the places you mention (I haven't been to the mall), I think the biggest difference is one-way aisles (which not everyone will abide by, depending on where you are and the hour of the day). There are sneeze-guard-like sheets of plastic at the cash registers, and you're expected to keep more space between you/your cart and the cashier or other shoppers in line. That can make for frustrating traffic jams as carts in spaced-out checkout lanes overlap into the ends of the aisles, but this is more of an issue at TJ's or Hannaford (which you didn't mention but is my nearest supermarket) than at Market Basket, because of their layouts.

In a lot of places, the first hour of shopping in the morning is reserved for seniors and at-risk shoppers. Some places this is true every day, other places it's specific days of the week. 

I think that the deli counters of supermarkets are still only selling prepackaged items, not cut to order, but I haven't specifically checked recently.

Overall, things are pretty sane. Last year I would hear from cashiers or friends about fist fights between customers, people throwing things in frustration, etc. I can't remember the last time I heard about anything like that, other than Facebook posts about people throwing anti-mask fits.

There are still weird supply chain blips now and then, times when they'll be out of something you'd never expect them to be out of. But no different than what you've experienced with online ordering, obviously.

The norms of when you should expect a store to be busy have changed, but I haven't mastered the new norms. It feels like this is slightly different now than it was six months ago, when more people were still working from home and kids were doing remote learning. But speaking as someone who has always worked from home, I used to hit the supermarket around 7 in the morning and could depend on it being nearly empty -- and then as soon as toilet paper became hard to find, everyone else started doing the same thing. It's not *crowded* in the early morning now, but it's definitely not as empty as it would have been pre-pandemic. Market Basket seems to be a little more crowded in the morning than Hannaford, but don't hold me to that.

(On the other hand, Trader Joe's? Nearly empty before 11am, every time I've gone.)

"The New England Cottontail was never on the Endangered Species List, but it was on the candidate list. It was removed from that list in 2015 because the population had grown. Further, the population has grown in Southern New Hampshire, but since it's original habitat was considerably larger it could easily be considered endangered throughout its range while being plentiful in Nashua.

All of which is supposition. Somebody must be keeping track of the population and knows whether we are seeing more New England Cottontails or Eastern Cottontails. It could be either, I think.

Update: I just looked up how to tell the difference. It is very subtle, I probably can't tell in the dark, but the next time I see one in the light I'll take a look.

Codex is a 20s themed speak easy restaurant and bar and I’ve never been disappointed with anything there.",t2_tpqqnc,Kuhalsu,0,1614013157.0,0,t1_gocvmz4,gocvmz4,True,GoldenRedhead,t3_lp8bpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashua/comments/lp8bpq/what_are_your_favorite_restaurants/,What are your favorite restaurants?,/r/nashua/comments/lp8bpq/what_are_your_favorite_restaurants/gocvmz4/,2,r/nashua,0,2
"Yeah down town Nashua used to have this great place next to the speak easy. I think they moved to Manchester.

California burritos have been around for years now but they've expanded their operations to Hudson and amherst. 

In N Out/ Baja? Are newer.  They took a while to open.

"That's great, and you're right about it being a family run operation. Someone on the Nashua FB was imploring people to go there because I think it opened during or just before the Pandemic and like everyone else, likely weren't doing so great at the time. I'm not sure if there is any relation to La Santa but they had flyers at the door there the few times I went.

I used to love that Mexican place downtown. There was an older woman with a grill (teeth grill) who would make you table side quac... It was so good.",t2_l3r70bp,suburbanpiratee,0,1614012415.0,0,t1_goctxa3,goctxa3,False,GoldenRedhead,t3_lp8bpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashua/comments/lp8bpq/what_are_your_favorite_restaurants/,What are your favorite restaurants?,/r/nashua/comments/lp8bpq/what_are_your_favorite_restaurants/goctxa3/,3,r/nashua,0,3
"Seems people have got you covered for every meal but breakfast. The downtown area somehow manages to support 2 great bagel places. Bagel Alley is great and has been around for ages. Whatabagel is a relative newcomer (been around a 5-6 years) which has seen 3 owners. The first owner was great but moved away to help family. The new owner is also great and has a great staff. The 2 offer different flavors and style of bagel. I suggest you try both.

In terms of a sit down place I'd head to Bedford. It's not a long ride but they have a Friendly Toast. The Purple Finch Cafe is also very good. You'll probably have people tell you to go to Parkers Maple Barn. It might still be good, but unfortunately the quality had fallen over the years.",t2_l3r70bp,suburbanpiratee,0,1614011882.0,0,t1_gocsp36,gocsp36,True,GoldenRedhead,t3_lp8bpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashua/comments/lp8bpq/what_are_your_favorite_restaurants/,What are your favorite restaurants?,/r/nashua/comments/lp8bpq/what_are_your_favorite_restaurants/gocsp36/,3,r/nashua,0,3
