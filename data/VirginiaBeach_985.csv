"So judgey for a person who doesn't have kids. Saying the parents are bad people because the kids do what kids do - play, explore, learn to walk, drop stuff. Hmmm really bad parenting... because they weren't raised like you to be a church mouse. Okay...

Meet your neighbors instead. Stop by and introduce yourself. Bring a bottle of wine for the parents. And cookies for the kids. There's no harm in being a decent person, explaining what you hear from your apartment and try to work it out.

Maybe they need a carpet in the kids' play area? Couldn't hurt to ask or recommend.

"I thought this was on AITA at first .. there are constantly posts like this in that subreddit! 🤣

From a noise ordinance side, during the day, they would need to exceed 65 dBA measured at least 4 ft away from ceiling. Considering the sporadic nature of the noise, may prove challenging for police to capture it. 

If I were you, I’d buy a decibel sound meter anyway to hold up while recording (just make sure it’s dBA). Even if the decibel meter shows less than 65… it could help your case with your apartment complex. May even be a specific dBA number in your lease that you now have documented as a violation. If it’s over 65, well.. give non-emergency a go and get a copy of the report. 

Def add the camera as a quick open widget on your phone’s Lock Screen so you don’t even need to bother with an app. All phone types stamp the date/time in metadata of videos/photos. 

Keep going up the chain with your property managers (in writing) and keep compiling the evidence (videos, police reports etc). Are there any other neighbors on your floor who hear them too? Get them to email the complaint as well.

"My girlfriend has been dealing with the exact same issue for almost the same time frame. Ever since her upstairs neighbors moved in its been insane. She's recorded video after video of what sounds like someone slamming an encyclopedia on the floors repeatedly for hours on end. She's tried notes on the door and talking with the leasing office, but not much came about the leasing office confronting them about the excessive noise. (The people in question said it was they toddler learning to walk, which if thats thr case this kids sounds like a 300lbs heavy lifter). She ended up calling the non-emergency police and she's had peace for a couple nights now.

I'd recommend doing the same. Take videos of the noise for documentation, note durations, etc. If your complex has security, get their number and call them with the complaints in addition to the non-emergency number. Also, speak to the property manager. Not one of the desk jockeys. Document what they say and hold them accountable. They are supposed to enforce the lease and the clause of reasonable peace is a part of that lease. If they refuse to do something, keep documenting. Get ahold of someone from their corporate office (if it's Breeden or the like) and present everything to them. Going up the ladder is about the only thing you can do aside from seeing what you can do legally. The lease is a contract between renters and landlords, and they are not enforcing and upholding their part of the agreement.

I really feel for you as it's rage inducing to not be able to sleep, work, or go about your day with obnoxious neighbors. I also had to deal with this crap in the past, and is why I hate Breeden with a passion as they are the worst when it comes to property management.

"The Vibe district is the arts district by the ocean front. Murals, street art, some cute restaurants and cafes. It’s nothing as grand as Venice beach but it’s what we have :) 

The Museum of Contemporary Art is by the oceanfront, too. Cool spot. 

In nearby Norfolk, Va there’s the Chrysler art museum and the Chrysler glass studio. The arts district is called NEON. Murals and such. There’s the d’art building with local artists. 

You might want to check out the Raleigh Room bar in the old Cavalier at the oceanfront. It’s a historic hotel that presidents, Al Capone, Frank Sinatra, etc stayed out. Recently renovated. The art in the Raleigh room is pretty bad ass.

HOWDY! Welcome to the East Coast!

There is stuff to do. Quite a bit but the resort area is just starting to rev up a bit as it hasn't gotten consistently ""warm"" yet.

There is the Virginia Beach Museum of Contemporary Art(MoCA)..there might be something at the Virginia Beach's massive conference center so check there..if not..it's a beautiful structure to walk around as it has built in ponds on the outside with fish/frogs a lot. There is also the Stravitz Sculpture & Fine Art Galleries which I heard about. [Check more out here.](https://www.vbgov.com/residents/arts-leisure/Pages/Visual-Arts-Spaces-and-Galleries.aspx)


You can go to the Virginia Beach Aquarium that's been remodeled and upgraded recently..it's fun for all ages.

There is also quite a bit of statutes or little historical aspects walking up and down the boardwalk..a lot are dedicated to our military of course but there is other things and you HAVE to see the Neptune statute which is a well known landmark.

There is public events/activities that go on as well but I don't keep up with it like I should.

"Welp, er...too bad we're a seafood town! :) But you can easily avoid it. For Norfolk, try Waterside, Nauticus, The Battleship Wisconsin, MacArthur Center (Mall), Granby Street, Ghent, the Neon District--all located right in or very near Downtown Norfolk. The Hermitage is a cool old house on the waterfront that is also a museum. Also, the Chrysler Museum is amazing, 225K sq ft on two levels (so plan your time accordingly), as are the free glass blowing demonstrations across the street at the Perry Glass Studio (affiliated with the Museum). The Norfolk Botanical Gardens are a true delight! For VB, try the Virginia Aquarium, Fort Story, DeWitt Cottage, The Life Saving Museum, The Historic Houses...more inland. For shopping and eating, try Laskin Rd, Hilltop, Shore Drive (Chesapeake Bay), The Oceanfront (Atlantic and Pacific Aves and the numbered streets)....and the happening and young Vibe District near 15th and 17/18th streets and the Oceanfront area. IF you are outdoorsy, First Landing State Park, Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge and False Cape State Park (Plus adjacent Sandbridge Beach which is more like the Outer Banks of NC) are beautiful this time of year.

"If you enjoy walking, then you should check out the Elizabeth River Trail it starts at Harbor Park just south of downtown and goes on for 10 miles. The first 3 miles are the best as it takes you through downtown and passes through the historic Freemason District. You also get beautiful views of Portsmouth and some shipyards. Also, Ocean View Chesapeake Beach, and the North End of VB are the best beaches if you don't want all the tackiness of the Oceanfront. If you wanna see some swamps and marshes, then check out First Landing State Park.  Here are some restaurant recommendations:
Ghent-- Mr Shwarma, 80/20 burger bar.
Chesapeake Beach: Bay Local. 
Oceanfront/ Vibe District: Aloha Cafe, Pizza Chapel, and Harvest.

"If you can't keep them and aren't able to properly vet homes for them, contact [Virginia Beach SPCA](https://vbspca.com/surrender/). They will help make sure they are vaccinated, neutered, and adopted into homes that are well suited for them. They can also help you get the mother spayed through their affordable neuter programs. They may have contacts with rescues or individuals who can help you find a place for the puppies.

Its really important to make sure the puppies are healthy, vaccinated, and going to good homes. If you choose to sell them, please do it with their best interest at heart and make sure you know/trust the people, visit their homes, etc. Ask your personal network first. Try to avoid craigslist, FB market, etc. so you don't get 1) scammed and 2) sell to someone who has bad intentions/shouldn't have a pet. Ask lots of questions about how the pet will live (inside, crate trained, etc.) 

I would contact the SPCA first - if nothing else they can give you more detailed information on what to look for in new homes. Its more important they find good homes, than it is too make money off them. They can also help you prevent another unplanned litter.

"Just pulled up old quote - there was some reason we got a discount but I can't remember why - might have had to do with the material? They offer military but it wasn't that. For 1,900 square feet, we paid approximately $2,700 in labor + $10,100 in materials ($8,200 for carpet/$1,700 for the pad/$200 freight) minus the $1,500 discount, we spent about $11,300. 

We only got one other quote, and the labor was more expensive.  Labor costs I listed also included haul away of old stuff, moving furniture, and the work for the two staircases we had done. The carpet I picked was well over $4/square foot, so you can save a few bucks there lmao. Doing the math, our labor costs were like $1.42/square foot, material costs like $5.31/square foot.

"We used [Cherry Carpet](https://cherrycarpet.com/), they're based in Portsmouth but service all of 757. They have tons of options, and would definitely work with a budget if you told them you were looking to spend X amount. For instance, we knew exactly what carpet we wanted, didn't really care about the cost, but the rep suggested going for a lower pile on the stairs to save a few bucks - no one could tell, and it was a great idea. Even though we knew which carpet we wanted, the rep did a great job verifying it would be a good fit for us (asking about pets, dislikes about old carpet, etc.)

They're supper efficient and easy to work with, respond quickly, and install was awesome. Their showroom is beautiful, so if you don't know what you want yet, pay them a visit!

"Whether you actually need this is a question.  It depends in part on when your home was built.  Pre-1980 copper and cast iron were used and they tend to stay relatively sound after many years underground as long as they are not near trees with extended root systems.  Dupont (I believe) began making a plastic based alternative to copper for water lines in the 80's and it was a disaster, decaying rapidly and causing major leaks only a few years after installation.  If memory serves there was a class action suit and Dupont had to reimburse the cost of replacement.  Most municipalities banned its use thereafter.  So anything built recently--say from the mid 90's on is likely to be good. Also check with neighbors, if more than one have had issues in the past it makes sense to have coverage, but I would check my home owners insurance carrier first to see if it is already covered and if not ask about the cost of adding it rather than having to deal with a 3rd party.",t2_cmy49,lindenb,0,1648042994.0,0,t1_i1sl21x,i1sl21x,True,IAskDumbQuestions999,t3_tkh3ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tkh3ac/watersewer_line_insurance/,water/sewer line insurance,/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tkh3ac/watersewer_line_insurance/i1sl21x/,1,r/VirginiaBeach,0,1

"This isn't 1965. There's no shelters, nowhere to run. Deployed subs give you a maximin of 30 minutes and a minimum of SEVEN minutes flight time to target.

">...at the same time providing them with spiritual bread""...

It's right there. No need to cherry pick.

Explain what you believe this statement of purpose to mean.

Please define ""spiritual"", if you can.

At what point did I imply that I thought you were a Christian?  I believe you when you tell me that you are not a Christian. You continue to insist that I am an anti-theist regardless of my correcting your assumption. The fact that you can't seem to return that courtesy speaks volumes.

If you want to know where I stand and what I believe, ask me.

I am an agnostic atheist who holds humanist secular ethical values to be superior to Christian ethical values.

I feel that proselytizers are most often people who have been indoctrinated and are, themselves, to be pitied to an extent . I have an understanding of why they feel compelled to do what they do and realize that it is a result of their own indoctrination. Let me state this clearly for you. I do not dislike theists.  I dislike the act of proselytizing and indoctrination.

Do you feel that proselytizing to war refugees in crisis is a positive act? My distaste for religious proselytizing (whether of the Christian flavor or otherwise) seems to irk you terribly. I'd be sincerely interested to know why.

Had you read the article, you could see what she was reported to be doing:

>She had been helping distribute food to people who were hiding in bomb shelters.

Then you go on to cherry pick what the organization she works for does completely trying to twist what she was doing there but it's not like what you cherry picked was even that bad. It's okay tho, your anti-theism comments and prejudice are oozing out of your pores as much as you are in denial.

One caveat is that track in the article is on 658 acres, which is about four times the size of a typical golf course.  So, pretty big.

"There are 5 public golf courses in Virginia Beach. The median cost to construct a golf course is 14 million USD. The low is 7 million and high is 25 million.

According to [this](https://www.masslive.com/news/2013/08/palmer_motorsports_park_plan_b.html) article, a track constructed in Palmer, Mass. a 2.5 mile track with 14 turns, cost them 20 million to make. Anecdotally I knew a guy in FL who made his own track on his land and his total cost was 200k/mile, though he didn't need to make a parking lot or amenities.

It's an expensive way of getting kids who think they're Ken Block off the street sure, but it is more morally sound than arresting them when they have no legal way to have fun in their cars. Give them somewhere to do their thing and if they still choose the streets, throw the book at them.

"I live RIGHT down the street from these apartments. I watched them get built. There are plans right across the street for some shopping and restaurants but they aren't even built yet. As far as what is around currently...there is a bike/walking path close by but it doesn't really go anywhere special. In one direction you have VB Blvd which leads to Town Center which has lots of restaurants and more of a younger night life. There's a Target, Walmart, and Wegman's for larger shopping. In the other direction, that you could walk or bike safely to, you have a more suburban shopping area with a TJ Maxx, Hallmark, thrift stores, record shop, etc. There are also some decent family restaurants (pizza, Mexican, diners) and chains (Moe's, 5 Guys, Starbucks, etc). In the other direction there is a golf course you could walk or bike to safely. There is also a Top Golf close by. 

I was born in this area and bought my house in the Arrowhead neighborhood of VB about 12 years ago. All in all, I like it. It's a decent family area if you end up having kids in the future.

"As others have stated, you will definitley need a car. There are plenty of places that are walkable (Town Center and Oceanfront for sure) but VB is a huge city and there are fun things to do in other cities close by as well. VB is not only beaches but lots of farmland as well. So, you can be in a busy resort area and then 15 minutes later be in the middle of nowhere. 

I live in VB and am nowhere near jet noise. I lived in an apartment as a teenager and it was AWFUL for jet noise. Like, windows shaking can't hear each other in the same room type of loud. So, it depends on where you live. Here is a site with a jet noise map. Scroll to the end of the page.

"1) How are you coming in? As in, will you even have work authorization? The US has some very very strict rules about working here. A lot of local jobs also are military or government adjacent and require security clearances. This is a hard question to answer without knowing your status and what kind of work you want to do.

2) Hidden pros and cons are very personal. For me, hidden pros are that there are a lot of beautiful off the beaten path nature type trails, good bike riding. The north end of the beach is nice. Cons - the traffic is horrific, we get next to no entertainment (bands literally skip over most of Virginia), the heavy military culture can get irritating and also simultaneously there's a distinct lack of community and culture.

3) There's a decent nerd community here. We get NekoCon in Hampton and a few other conventions are a short driving distance away. We have a few board game cafes/game shops and comic book stores. Most of the activities are in May-October. Winter is pretty dead here.

4) Depends on your job situation. My husband and I got by on one car when he first immigrated here, but public transport was ridiculously unreliable for him. He absolutely couldn't take it to work (he was late a few times and almost got fired), so I adjusted my work hours to drive him in. He would still take it home and at least once every 2 weeks, the bus just wouldn't show up. I wouldn't rely on public transport unless you're just going around the area, never for work.

"Sorry this happened to you--my wife had a much better experience. She put in for a contest for a free session for a military spouse, she won. She still had to pay the $100 deposit and was contacted via a GMail account. I know it seems sketchy as they are nationwide, but the traveling photographers sometimes use personal email accounts as they are contractors, not employees, as far as I can tell.

But I digress, she had to pay the $100 deposit to hold her spot, but that went towards the cost of the photos. She had a great time, I believe it was 1.5 hours - 2 hours, and everything was professional, her female photographer was very responsive during and before the shoot: She wanted my wife to give her outfit and shooting ideas so they could all be prepped and ready to go. Overall, it was successful for both my wife and her friend who did one a little later.

Potentially, it could be someone posing as ATB? I'm not sure if you contacted the owner of the Groupon (i.e. contractor, photographer), as again, they are a nationwide company, not local. Their social media has this email listed: [info@allthingsboudoir.com](mailto:info@allthingsboudoir.com).

"I mean… typically pro bono only happens when there is some kind of severe city/state/federal level issue at hand. 

Your friend probably needs to get her expectations lowered a bit that she will win a suit for illegal recording. It isn’t against the law in most states, as long as a participant of the conversation is the one doing the recording. There are a handful of states that require all party consent, so if your friend or her ex resides in one of them… may have a shot. You can check if their respective states are on the all consent list here: https://www.justia.com/50-state-surveys/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations/

Her best bet is to get her divorce attorney to help add clarifications/context to the conversation. If her current lawyer isn’t helping her, then she may have admitted to something self-incriminating where there is no recourse. If your friend thinks otherwise; then she is within her rights to fire her attorney and get a new one.

"Funny story re: Lynnhaven and jet noise. I know someone who moved to VB in the 60's during the Vietnam War era. The family rented a house not far from where Lynnhaven Mall now stands, when it was an undeveloped plot of trees. There was a LOT of noise over the area even back then. Even more so because of the type of aircraft being utilized at the Naval base.  Anyway, one day all the kids in the neighborhood went tearing down the street on bikes because they witnessed a Navy pilot eject from his plane as it was crashing. His parachute got caught up in the trees on the land there and he survived. There he was, dangling up in the trees in his flight suit, waiting for someone from the base to come get him down.

I've heard that the Navy really tried to strongly object to the building of Lynnhaven Mall back in the day because it was in the flight path and they preferred it to stay undeveloped.",t2_4jjpawjn,SarcasmIsMyBloodType,0,1647321993.0,0,t1_i0prxpv,i0prxpv,False,Kumoufu,t3_te6tbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/te6tbl/moving_to_virginia_beach/,Moving to Virginia Beach,/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/te6tbl/moving_to_virginia_beach/i0prxpv/,2,r/VirginiaBeach,0,2

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) — The iconic Virginia Beach Fishing Pier is under contract to be sold to owners of a well known resort retailer.

The pier is under contract to be purchased by owners of Sunsations USA. The company, which owns 11-stores in the Oceanfront resort specializing in T-shirts, swimwear and souvenirs is based in Ocean City, Md., and is owned by the Siboney family.

If the sale goes through they will be only the second owners in the pier’s 72 year history. Since the pier was built in 1950, it has been owned by three different families: the Murdens, the Lachmans and the Bonneys.


While the purchase price isn’t yet known, the longtime attorney for the pier owners, R.J. Nutter, said a vote before Virginia Beach City Council Tuesday is the final hurdle in the sale. The city must agree to transfer the franchise agreement that allows the pier owner to operate and maintain the pier on the portion of city land that runs between the boardwalk and the “mean low water line” between 14th and 15th streets. The owner must pay the city $20,000 a year for the agreement.

Nutter said the pier is tough to maintain and the families are “getting older.”

While there is no redevelopment proposal on the table right now. Nutter believes there will be one.

“The city knows that once the new owner figures out what they want to do, they will come forward with a proposal,” Nutter said.


Today the pier is home to fishing, Ocean Eddies Seafood Restaurant and retail shops.

There was a push to build a new pier four years ago in partnership with the city. However the proposal for the pier caused controversy and the families who own the pier said they would no longer negotiate with the city to redevelop their land at 15th Street.

An attorney representing Sunsations didn’t immediately return requests for comment. They already do own the property known as the “Pier Shops” across Atlantic Avenue from the pier.",t2_3dg9fyze,dot_matrix_game,0,1647102656.0,0,t1_i0dtouf,i0dtouf,False,EvilTwin517,t3_tccc1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tccc1l/sunsations_quietly_trying_to_buy_the_pier/,Sunsations quietly trying to buy the pier,/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/tccc1l/sunsations_quietly_trying_to_buy_the_pier/i0dtouf/,5,r/VirginiaBeach,0,5
