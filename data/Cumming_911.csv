"The City was established in 1834.
Wikipidia states: ""The community is commonly thought to be named after Colonel William Cumming. An alternate theory proposed by a local historian posits the name honors Rev. Frederick Cumming, a professor of Jacob Scudder, a resident of the area since 1815 who owned land in present-day downtown. Yet another theory is that the town is named after Alexander Cuming, the son of a Scottish baronet""
So, looks like there were several people with the Sir Name of Cumming at that time. Likely the word did not then have the slang meaning that it has now. It was just named after a person, as many locations are. Slang terminology just took over the word and now when people hear the city name they jiggle.",t2_3jzhr,martiniranch,0,1647434061.0,0,t1_i0vl5c0,i0vl5c0,True,Dab_of_regret,t3_tfeepj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cumming/comments/tfeepj/why_did_someone_think_it_was_a_good_idea_2_name_a/,Why did someone think it was a good idea 2 name a city cumming,/r/cumming/comments/tfeepj/why_did_someone_think_it_was_a_good_idea_2_name_a/i0vl5c0/,11,r/cumming,0,11

The only other comment, I just read not so long ago about a Mexican restaurtant in Forsyth that had an absolutely terrible inspection - around like a 46 I think.  I think it was the one in Lakeland Plaza but can't remember.  Any, it would never have occurred to me to check latest inspections if I hadn't heard about that.

"I know the feeling with the one circuit in the garage.  Luckily, sort of, my laundry is in my garage so I run an extra heavy duty extension cord from it to other things.

Oh, wait, I can tell you one NOT to go with - Coffee Electric.  Nice guy but when he showed up after I bought my home, with a list of everything agreed upon to get fixed, he misplaced it and didn't fix half the shit he was supposed to.  I had no internet at the time and couldn't look it up and said ""Go back and print it"" and he just wouldn't.  He did work on some things that weren't on the list but I'd never hire him.

I'm about to get my crappy old LP siding replaced, possibly as early as Thursday (doubt it), so I'll certainly have an opinion of the siding company I went with.  Let me tell you, hiring a contractor without a referral from someone you know is a beeeeyotch.  Seems they're all shady to some degree, and the one guy a friend referred me to came and took measurements but I had to damned near beat him to get replies to e-mails, texts and calls.

"I am sorry for your grandma.  

But unfortunately there is no perfect society and their are no perfect people. Accidents, negligence and crimes are going to happen and need policing(including the police). I don't mean to sound brash, but in perspective, if a person of one ethnicity was injured or killed by a person of a different ethnicity then I would hope you can understand that is not a valid reason for the victim's family to carry hate for an entire group of people because of the tragedy. 

There are plenty of high speed chases that are stopped by police and undoubtedly saved lives as well. We can't have a society were if you run from the police it's a get out of jail free pass. We can certainly work on better protocols, better training, better equipment etc. And let's not forget there are officers that have died in the line of work through no fault of their own trying to protect the innocent as well.  

Plenty of people have been killed by speeders, light infractions, people with driving records that have proven they are unfit for the responsibility to drive  too.  

You lumping cops/bankers/landords/rich together is no different than the POS racist cop with his preconceived notions. You are both very much in the wrong.

"My interpretation of history is as follows: 1865 slavery abolished. 1965 segregation was abolished. There were Jim Crow laws instituted, like: no soliciting, no loitering. Those laws were not meant for white people, but for black people. After segregation; those laws we‚Äôre not taken off the books. Law enforcement start imposing ‚Äúold‚Äù Jim Crow laws on poor whites as well as blacks and Latinos. Those laws have transformed into more laws like disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, loitering, etc. Now, law enforcement has to justify their budgets: new cars, weapons, laptops, uniforms, training. Not to mention, there were poor man taxes instituted like: speeding, tail light infractions, safety violations, tags, licensing. Rich citizens can take their car and get it fixed. Poor people have to fix those themselves, or pay to get fixed. All of these laws now impact daily life, without providing any benefit. A tail light infraction, while slightly unsafe; causes great financial issues to poor people. There is no great saving grace that tag lights fix; it‚Äôs just a light bulb. All of these minor laws, along with poll taxes, and voting laws disenfranchise poor people from traveling and voting. Why, because you‚Äôre poor. 

Now, modern day: we have all these excessive fees/laws that bring down poor people. You get a suspended license, you can‚Äôt drive, you drive anyways because you have to work, now you‚Äôre in the system. Your car may be towed, impounded. It all adds up. Rich people have money and lawyers. They can pay their way out of trouble. Law enforcement budgets keep increasing, and more laws keep getting added. 

I could go on tangents like terry stops; which I consider way unconstitutional. Basically, when you get pulled over, you‚Äôre detained. They‚Äôve criminalized minor violations into breaking the 4th amendment. Now, you no longer have due process because you‚Äôre driving. It‚Äôs a very slippery slope. The reason I call cops racist; is because they still enforce laws meant for black people. They may not know this, but they should. 

All jokes aside; I would institute a law that says: every time you add a law, you have to take one away. It would get rid of frivolous laws, and only keep the important ones that actually impact safety. 

The Supreme Court has also ruled that cops have no duty to protect. The SC also ruled, cops can act for officer safety, meaning they pretty much can do whatever in the name of officer safety. Cops also have qualified immunity; meaning they can‚Äôt get charged for a crime while in duty; there‚Äôs exceptions, but few and far between. Basically, they‚Äôre not held responsible for their actions. 

I say all of this to say: citizens are becoming more scrutinized for the littlest things. I could make the argument: ‚Äúcops are just doing their job‚Äù; I wouldn‚Äôt though. They now have police, and prison unions. Prisons have been incorporated and utilize politics to sway politicians for more laws. All for profit. Not safety. 

I guess why I‚Äôm adamant about citizens not supporting the police is because they already have too much support. The laws are in their favor. Republicans and Democrats both support prison industrialization. Local politicians support them. There has to be an opposing force to them. Just for honesty sake. We can‚Äôt all support them, it‚Äôs not fair to the system. There has to be opposition to make them better. That‚Äôs pretty much why I feel the way I do. Not to mention, my sweet, loving, grandma who taught math for 40 years was seriously injured by a high pursuit chase by a out of control officer. She was a bystander. She wasn‚Äôt even moving. 

I hope this makes sense. :)

"How many laws get added every year for the average citizen? A lot. We can go to jail for disorderly conduct, victimless crimes, petty crimes. How many laws get added for bankers? Unless Congress, SEC, FTC, or the FBI get together, they don‚Äôt get any added. Which crimes have the greatest impact? For instance: asset & civil forfeiture has increased so much for the common citizen; that it‚Äôs greater than all petty thefts combined. If you take 5k to the airport, and they find it; you‚Äôre out 5k. You‚Äôre not getting it back.

"Once again, instead of providing details; you make assumptions of my wealth, and free time. You‚Äôre personally attacking me, and not my ideals. 

Your rhetoric is more akin to a rich person who doesn‚Äôt understand how much the system has helped them, nor understand how complex the system is. The rich has corporate socialism for themselves, and rugged individualism for poor people. Your rhetoric sounds ancient, outdated, and doesn‚Äôt apply to anyone; but maybe you. I‚Äôve heard your rhetoric spoken by rich people, and by poor people who thought they were rich. Thinking a certain way doesn‚Äôt guarantee success. Where you were born, how much money your parents have, how much education you received, and other environmental factors are far greater factors than ‚Äúmindset‚Äù. Mindset definitely helps, but it‚Äôs way less a factor than environment. 

Do you really believe people born with handicaps, poor parents, poor education, can simply will themselves to greatness? It happens, but not very often. It‚Äôs an inspiring story, but not likely; which makes the feat seem greater in hindsight. 

Nature versus nurture is complex, and they work hand in hand. How many great minds have been ruined by their poor environment? How many simple minds thrived in a great environment?

Thanks for confirming that you are in fact the deadbeat that thinks a landlord owes you something because the landlord might be financially better off than you. Being a landlord is a job just like owning a business. Interesting you failed to answer why not just go into the restaurant, eat and refuse to pay?

I suggest you spend less time convincing yourself that it's other's faults for your own shortcomings and take some personal responsibility.

"You don‚Äôt need an attorney: yep, most people getting evicted have law degrees. People getting evicted don‚Äôt have a clue what the laws are; they get taken advantage of, but they‚Äôre all thieves in your eyes. What are private individuals/ corporations who act as slum lords; while they refuse to repair properties rented out to poor individuals? Is that theft too? 

Oh the poor landlords with their 30-40 properties they own, such a shame for them. Here‚Äôs a question for you: when landlords go and acquire property and jack up the rental costs; are the renters responsible for the rates going up? Landlords charge 25-50% more than the mortgage would be for said property. but a poor renter cant get a mortgage; so they have to rent. It‚Äôs a dirty cycle, but who cares as long as landlords make their money. 

What‚Äôs my move when a crime happens: 1st off, I protect my family the best I can. The 2nd amendment is there for me to protect myself and family from criminals, and the government ( but you‚Äôre only worried about the criminals). For the most part, I‚Äôd put on my big boy pants and deal with it. If it‚Äôs a serious crime, the cops aren‚Äôt probably going to help anyway. They hardly recover stolen items, they frame people indiscriminately, and they can‚Äôt go back in time and fix the issue. Can the cops unrape/ unmurder someone; nope they can‚Äôt. If you want justice for the crime, you have to go through crooked district attorneys and judges. Did you know we have 3 DAs in GA indicted for felonies currently?

The reason Forsyth county has a low crime rate, is because it‚Äôs the richest county. Rich areas don‚Äôt have high crime rates, generally speaking. Crime rates in poverty areas are high. When people don‚Äôt get a good education, in a poor area; they tend to fall in the cracks and get caught up in the system. Of course, they stay poor because of probation, and other government hindrances. Good ole government loves to pick on poor people, addicts, and other individuals who are trying to recover.

"You don't need to hire an attorney to take your landlord to court. Plenty of resources available online to educate yourself. Maybe you should spend more time learning than spewing your bullshit narratives. 

The eviction process is NOTHING like you described. Tenants get the chance to answer an eviction in court well before your stuff gets moved to the curb. And even if the court sides with the landlord, then they are still given time to move before the sheriff removes you. 

Not paying rent is theft, period. You don't walk into a restaurant eat a meal and get to say yo cOvId I'm not paying my bill either.

"Yes, you can take your landlord to court; how long and how much money would that take? If your landlord goes through your apartment without your permission; yes you can call the cops on them. Once again, the cops are going to side with the landlord more often than not. Not always though. 

If you can‚Äôt pay rent; for example during COVID, a sheriff shows up with a gun, pepper spray, and taser to forcefully remove you. Can you go to court, nope. They move your stuff to the curb, for anyone to take. 

The point being: the landlord has the advantage. What happens if you don‚Äôt pay rent because your landlord hasn‚Äôt fixed the HVAC? You still get kicked out, while your case goes to civil court. The landlord always has the advantage, even if they‚Äôre wrong. 

Reason # 1,000 why you shouldn‚Äôt move to Cumming: you‚Äôre trying to have a rational conversation, and the person calls you a ‚Äúdead beat ass‚Äù.

I simply do understand how people stand up for the government; when we constantly have tax rates rising, and get less from those tax proceeds. Do you like paying more taxes, for more laws and enforcement, and less services? 

But, go ahead and tell me how great Forsyth is; you‚Äôre a shining example! Are you going to the next Klan rally in downtown Cumming? You can go and hang out with Forsyth sheriffs and tell them how much you love them. You can shake their hands, maybe shine their boots for them.

In other ways they're not equivalent, because you know, every comparison is not perfect.  If you want a perfect comparison, you can only compare a thing to ... itself.  That's the one kind of comparison that is ever perfect, and it's useless.

If you or I murder/manslaughter someone; we go to jail. If police murder/manslaughter someone; they have qualified immunity from imprisonment. Why have judges/juries; let cops decide since they can‚Äôt go to jail.

Lastly, police have no obligation to protect us. The courts have ruled on that a long time ago. If you are not protecting yourself and your family; you‚Äôre in for a world of pain. Police are minutes away, when seconds count. Police hardly find stolen property, when they do it‚Äôs been damaged. Police frame people when they can‚Äôt solve crimes. Police enforce Jim Crow laws that have never been taken off the books, hence their inherent racial nature. 

I‚Äôm not ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù any profession, especially law enforcement. I don‚Äôt go around saying ‚Äúsupport the brown line‚Äù for plumbers. Why would I stand up for police? Americans that are truely patriotic stand up to the government; they don‚Äôt side with police, judges, and politicians. These groups already use mass media to propagandize us to fit their constraints.

"I'm a black man living in south Forsyth County. In fact, I'm pretty close to the border of John's Creek and Cumming. I think this area is very, very diverse nowadays and I haven't had any issues. Even when I had to deal with police for a minor issue,  interactions were very courteous, fine,  and I had no extenuating problems. 

I will say that John's Creek and Alpharetta have great schools as well.  Homes appreciate nicely,  diversity is increasing.  The only drawback ids the difference in Fulton County taxes vs what you would pay in Forsyth County. 

I would agree however,  that,  if you do choose Forsyth,  stay below Hwy 20 for now (not to be confused with I-20).

Lots of quiet racism. People will be nice to your face; but say the n word when you‚Äôre not around. I‚Äôve heard the n word several times in the late night hour. Lake Lanier is a cesspool of someone dying every weekend; or the lake is so choppy you need a submarine to get around.

"The teachers of Forsyth County are wonderful and truly caring people who deserve way more money than they get.  The administrators (well, some of them) are idiots.  So I wish you luck on the school district and hope you have a better experience than we have.

As for racism, it‚Äôs here because it‚Äôs pretty much everywhere and the history of this county has a legacy, though I would agree it‚Äôs much more diverse than it was in the late 80s.  Prejudice of numerous kinds is also around, as one would expect.  My family isn‚Äôt religious, so that immediately put us on the outs in this area once people find out.  We‚Äôre also not die hard conservatives (we are middle-of-the-road issue-based voters) nor are we MAGA-hats.  All of this has made living here more difficult than it should ever have been.  It has made it difficult to find and keep friends.  But then so has COVID and our general homebody-ness, so it‚Äôs multi-faceted for us.

But we muddle through.  Once the kid is graduated, I suspect we‚Äôll move and try to find a place that better suits our mentality and culture.

I am reading the post kinda late but if you are in your 20‚Äôs please move to Alpharetta. I lived there almost 10 years in a condo off of Deerfield Parkway. I ended up buying a house in Cumming four years ago and boy do I regret it.  I still go to Alpharetta for everything such as shopping and restaurants. The shopping stores up here are old and outdated and no good restaurants other than a bunch of chain restaurants. For Cumming only being a little cheaper for home prices compared  Alpharetta you would think the area would look the part. Every time you see a new subdivision go up around here it‚Äôs from the high $600‚Äôs to 800‚Äôs I am like why would I pay that and the amenities are subpar. You are young there is nothing in Cumming for you with a budget of $2000 there are plenty of places you can move to in Alpharetta.

"As odd as it sounds, coffeeshops. I used to work at the Starbucks in the area and there are several groups of regulars that all met by just hanging out around the same times and striking up conversations. Several have gone into business together, a bunch just meet up every day and hang out and shoot the shit. The baristas don't mind as long as you're polite and buy something small while you're there. (Coffee and tea comes with free refills if you're a rewards member.)

"Dawsonville is a neat little town and just up 400.  If you're into cars they have the Georgia racing hall of fame that's pretty neat.  And hey, a distillery right there sells legal moonshine, lol.

Back to Cumming - There are canoe rental joints that drop you and the canoe off right below Buford dam then pick you up downstream.

If you like fishing there's the lake, not to mention the Chattahootchee river.

Speaking of the dam, it's pretty cool to be there when they release water to start generating electricity.  It's no big huge woosh of water, but it's cool to watch the level rise, roiling like crazy, then the air temp drops like 20 degrees from the cold lake water.  Release schedules can be found online.

If you're a veteran, or a direct descendant of a veteran, the Buford American Legion moved to Sugar Hill (closer to Cumming) and their new building just opened and you can likely join as a member of the Son's of the American Legion or the Auxiliary.  Open to the public on Saturdays and bike nights will be starting up very soon (music, food, band, lots of fun).  At some point trivia nights will be starting up and they have cash prizes.  It's just across the dam then a right on Suwanee Dam Rd, and the entrance is about 1.5 miles down on the right.  Not sure if they have proper signage up yet so it's easy to miss.

There are a LOT of good restaurants around.  Some of my favs are Asian House on 20/Samples behind Walgreens and they have some of the best Asian food around (in my opinion), Good Ol' Days Pub at Buford Dam Rd and 9 (warning:  smoking allowed) that has stellar food and frequent live music, Summit's Wayside tavern that's just down 9 a couple blocks from there (no smoking) that also has wonderful food, as well as something like 120 beer taps, and down Buford Dam from them there's Taco Mac (not a Mexican joint), another joint with great food and an incredible beer selection.  Taco Mexico makes good Mexican food, as does Los Rios.

On 20 near Windemere there's an excellent Italian joint named Quanto Basta, and a couple doors down from them is an excellent place called Asian Table that has Chinese, Thai, Indian and Singapore food.

Keep an eye on what's going on at the Cumming fairgrounds.  I think Covid kinda messed that up but events will come back.  Good fireworks on the 4th, usually with a nationally known band headlining the event (Charlie Daniels has played at least a couple times).",t2_4qswvsix,Scooter_127,0,1619730453.0,0,t1_gwcgx9q,gwcgx9q,True,dballzzz,t3_mzln0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cumming/comments/mzln0v/fun_things_to_do_in_cumming/,Fun Things to Do in Cumming,/r/cumming/comments/mzln0v/fun_things_to_do_in_cumming/gwcgx9q/,3,r/cumming,0,3

"As others have said, they are both great places, but if I were single & in my 20's, I'd definitely go for Alpharetta. If I were married with kiddos, I think the Cumming area might be a better choice.

"Hands down Alpharetta. I am 10 years out of college, and I now live in cumming with my husband and daughter (and honestly only moved here to be close to my family), but we consistently head to Alpharetta for the food, atmosphere, and brewery options. 

Cumming is a great place to raise a family- but not much in terms of ‚Äúfun‚Äù - or good dining options, as the vast majority are chain food options. This is the kind of place, in my opinion, you pick if you are settling down and wanting to be near good schools for your kids, etc. 

Downtown Alpharetta has been developing and is, overall, a really cool place. What‚Äôs also great about Alpharetta is it‚Äôs proximity to downtown Roswell and Sandy Springs. And of course, Atlanta is never too far away. 

If I was straight out of college, I would absolutely, 5000% pick Alpharetta over Cumming. Hope this helps!",t2_9oiodwmx,BoredMillennialMommy,0,1619484189.0,0,t1_gvzw9cc,gvzw9cc,True,[deleted],t3_mzbowm,https://www.reddit.com/r/cumming/comments/mzbowm/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/cumming/comments/mzbowm/deleted_by_user/gvzw9cc/,4,r/cumming,0,4
"Sorry, I can't comment on pricing in re: to rent but my gut feeling is that with Alpharetta being closer to the city and more fully developed, it's going to be more expensive.

Imo, Alpharetta living offers more choices that are often found in college towns than Forsyth does.  They have a lot more and varied bars/restaurants/shared spaces (Avalon, downtown Alpharetta)/retail, etc.  The southern part of Forsyth county has the The Collection, Halcyon and Vickery Village. So that growth and diversity in terms of choices for entertainment are slowly spreading from the southern part of the county to the northern.  The good news is that if living in Forsyth is more affordable driving to or Ubering to Johns Creek, Alpharetta or Milton are decently affordable for entertainment if you're thinking of it more like a couple of nights a week.  

I don't know about Alpharetta's green spaces so can only comment on Forsyth County's.  We have amazing parks and the Big Creek Greenway for walking/hiking trails is excellent.

Forsyth has a lot to offer but ""looking for excitement, things to do, lots of fun, "" wouldn't necessarily describe Cumming.  Imo, it's a great place to raise a family and I think that's where we're at in our development stage.  (This would've described Alpharetta 20 years)

My guess is that your decision is going to come down to what you're paying for - again me assuming rentals in Alpharetta are higher than Forsyth.  Renting in place that has a lot of high energy spots has lots of traffic and usually comes with a price tag.  You have more choices in Alpharetta for restaurants but I think you're going to have higher price points at those restaurants as well.  For example a ""hole in the wall"" restaurant in Alpharetta, I'd guess, is going to be higher priced than a ""hole in the wall"" restaurant in Forsyth with similar quality of food just based on real estate rentals.  (I could be way off base so please someone correct me if I'm wrong).

I think budgeting is the key.  Do you want to pay for rent to live in an area that might be a little less conducive to budgeting for entertainment?  Or do you want to pay lower in rent and have more opportunities to spend money on things like concerts, etc.?

I have a daughter getting ready to graduate as well and these are the things I'd hope someone would explain to her if she was asking the same question on reddit. :)

Good luck to you in your quest!  Congrats on being a grad. :)",t2_6ol79da1,r_I_reddit,0,1619483268.0,0,t1_gvzufou,gvzufou,True,[deleted],t3_mzbowm,https://www.reddit.com/r/cumming/comments/mzbowm/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/cumming/comments/mzbowm/deleted_by_user/gvzufou/,1,r/cumming,0,1

Maybe 12 cars a day even go by my house.

If I time it right I can be in downtown Helen in 45 mins.

Yet I am 45 mins away from all that crap 99% of the time.

If I won the Powerball I would just move further down  my street lol.

"Tupelo on Hwy. 20-the best lunch in town, IMHO. Great apps, salads, sandwiches & entrees. (They serve dinner, too, but lunch is more reasonable! :) Owned by the same ppl as Tam's Backstage; also great, but pricier

Marie's Italian deli- Also a great lunch, and their pizza and desserts are awesome. 

Babas Gyros & Kebabs: Great food; one of our favs for takeout.

Rooster's: Although my cholesterol goes up after visiting, the best wings and fries in town.

 Of course, it depends on where you're staying in Cumming. If you're closer to Alpharetta, there are LOTS of choices. If you're close to downtown, there are several places like Village Burger.

There is a cuban place called coco's that is very good.

"No. It is a nice area, but there is no public transportation unless you move into Fulton County. Very few apartments in Cumming are within walking distance of grocery or drug stores, although a few are near strip shopping centers. 

In nearby Fulton County, there are some areas in Johns Creek, Alpharetta, or Roswell where you could use public transportation, There are several (apartment) areas where you'd be able to walk to stores, restaurants, etc. but rent is much higher in these areas,and it is much more densely populated.

"So, I found that link on Next Door after voting today but would so have loved to have seen it before.  Though Sharon Springs is the most convenient, I would gladly have driven to cut the wait time.

My experience - went to Sharon Springs at 1:30 and there was a line and I heard someone from election office say about an 1 1/2 wait from where I was.  It ended up being just at a little over an hour.

Everyone in line outside was pretty much social distancing (maybe not 6 ft but keeping their distance).  95% were masked as well.  As we got closer to the building, the distance decreased maybe psychologically wanting it to be done.

Weirdly inside the building there was very little distancing and people bunching up though I did hear employees/volunteers? ask that people separate and not cross lines.  I purposely stayed back instead of moving forward and that ""reset"" the line a little bit once inside to those behind me.  There were only 2 people not masked in the building - one an elderly gentleman and a poll worker who kept her mask below her nose while I was in there.  To be fair, there were probably 14 poll workers who were in this room and all others were masked and conscientious of distance.

All in all, my experience was very positive and I highly recommend the facilities at Sharon Springs for the way they handled this situation.

"unfortunately so have I. But I have 4 issues 

1.why did they refuse an autopsy when this is the most part of the death investigation.

2.  why wasn't the entire house looked at as a crime scene, why was it only his bedroom and shared living spaces.  

3. why was his injuries to his arms and hand ignored?

4. Why IF his roommate has had 3 prior roommates to die while sharing a shared living space,... was he even investigated?

suicide is very selfish to the living because you are often left with so many questions. I get that.

"I don't really know anything about law but Googled this to try understand why/when the FBI would be involved.  I went on the assumption that the premise is that she was murdered.  So as I read it, the FBI only investigates federal crimes.  I googled when a murder is considered a federal crime below.  I don't have any idea but from the very limited research I've done, I don't think the FBI would get involved.  But, fully admit that I could be wrong.

1. When is murder a federal offense?

Murder is charged as a federal offense whenever the killing violates a **federal law**. In general, there are seven scenarios when an unlawful killing violates the laws of the federal government.

These include when:

1. the murder is of a **federal judge** or a **federal law enforcement official** (e.g., an agent of the FBI, TSA, or ATF),1
2. the killing is of an immediate **family member of a federal law enforcement official**,2
3. the murder is of an elected or appointed **federal official** (e.g., the President, a Supreme Court Justice, a member of Congress, or the murder of a federal judge),3
4. the killing is committed during a **bank robbery**,4
5. the killing takes place aboard a **ship at sea** (e.g., on a vessel that is engaged in interstate commerce per the [Commerce Clause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause) of the U.S. Constitution),5
6. the murder was designed to **influence a court case**,6 and
7. the killing takes place on **federal property** (e.g., on national parks or a Native American reservation).

"You are their perfect use case then.  I am not.  I upload legitimate files all the time because of my work (I work from home at least 2 days a week).  I also have services for personal use that benefit from higher upload speeds (such as remote game streaming, NextCloud hosting, etc.).  And I have a family so 1TB per month is so easy to hit due to all the Netflix streaming and various re-downloading of games I do because I change OSes almost as often as the moon phases.

Data caps are nothing more than money grabs and have no basis in reality in terms of manufacturing or any other incurred up-front costs to the provider.  We already pay for the service.

"Interesting because when I spoke directly with Comcast a year ago, they told me the Gigabit service had a slow upload speed (somewhere in the vicinity of 25-50 Mbps up) and a data cap of 1TB/mo.

Has any of that changed in the past year?  Because if so, that's good news, but I will still not venture away from AT&T (unless I move residences) due to AT&T GigaPower being synchronous.

Edit>> Also, if that requires the use of their wifi device, that's ridiculous.  I don't want my connection open to others and their wifi devices do just that.

Edit 2>> Just researched and they still have a typical data cap of 1TB even on their gigabit service, and nowhere on the marketing page does it list the upload speed.   Just crazy.

"The 1996 Telecommunications Act was supposed to get everyone fiber, but here we are. AT&T Fiber (formerly Gigapower) is a GPON service that's available up to 1gb symmetrical usually for $70-$90/mo thanks to assumed competition from Google Fiber. It's a passive single strand that effectively is spliced up to 24 times (residences). AT&T is leveraging [Corning's FlexNAP](https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/products/communication-networks/products/flexnap-systems-resource-center.html) product line to easily do it. IIRC this particular GPON spec is a 10gb link on the download to the ONT which then only passes that customer's packets on to the router and a 1GB uplink from the ONT that is time delimited so there aren't any collisions. They still use the same crappy RG, but it is a straight ethernet from the ONT, where the fiber terminates, and there are no DSLAMs.

To my knowledge AT&T's deployment is limited and they're starting to scale down new deployments. They upgraded most of the old IFITL service. They also laid down conduit in existing affluent neighborhoods that they predicted would get a decent uptake. They also laid down conduit in new neighborhoods.",t2_4zw4q,noc007,0,1563567451.0,0,t1_eu8yaiv,eu8yaiv,False,_Its_not_the_end_,t3_cf8z1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/cumming/comments/cf8z1n/is_there_fiber_ever_coming_to_cumming_like_ever/,Is there fiber ever coming to cumming?

"They only charge $1000 to get Comcast's Gigabit Pro service installed with two line items of $500 install and $500 activation on top of the monthly fee and I presume a minimum contract period.
