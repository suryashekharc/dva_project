"In addition to the Black Lager (which is my favourite beer or all time), their Bavarian Breakfast Wheat is absolutely top notch.

Cold Break has been unimpressive for me since they opened. I groan if my friends ever suggest it, honestly.

Counterpart and Bench are great.

Oast's seasonals are the best in the region. And their Saison is great.

A newer place that has outright impressed me is Blackburn. The Local Light stands out for me (as i often want a low calorie option -- I'm a gym rat who loves beer), but their entire lineup ranges from decent to great.

Niagara College routinely puts out fantastic beverages. Not sure what their current lineup is right now.

Lock Street had the best pumpkin ale (next to Oast) this past year, but they haven't really impressed me with much else.

Merchant Ale House has a few decent beers. The Blonde is good. And if you like sweeter beers, the blueberry beer is a must try.

Well that’s not bad however at 7 lb per paver ( old style ) 150 weigh 1050 lbs . That’s over the max weight allowable in a 1/2 ton Van . 200 = 1400 lb . Over weight by 400 lbs ! Plus you are not doing yourself any good wrecking your vehicle. My message know what you are dealing with . Most vans are 1/2 ton so moving 150 pavers is already over the limit. 3/4 ton van will allow you to transport 215 pavers . Same limits apply to a truck . Bottomline pavers are heavy - not the easiest to transport or install or remove. To note 7 lbs per paver is on average the weight of 4 in. x 8 in. x 3 1/4 . Some this size can be heavier. Newer pavers can be 4x8 but 2 in thick on average those weigh 5 1/4 lbs . Thinner pavers are not usually used on driveways. I’ve done my fair share of paver jobs over the years . It’s a physical job now is the time of year to do a hand tear out  job .  In the warmer weather it’s brutal .,t2_5uly78yk,Rockeye7,0,1648256764.0,0,t1_i2519xp,i2519xp,False,discattho,t3_tny2gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tny2gw/last_minute_anybody_want_to_help_me_move_patio/,Last minute - Anybody want to help me move patio pavers for 3-4 hours ($20/hour) this Saturday from between 12pm - 6pm?,/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tny2gw/last_minute_anybody_want_to_help_me_move_patio/i2519xp/,2,r/stcatharinesON,0,2

There was a vehicle what was doing that every morning at the same time at the corner of Willowdale and Westchester. This was about two years ago and Old Glenridge residents started recording it. Eventually the cops got wise and waited to catch them.

"That is many of the rules/laws/by-laws though.  There are not enough people for enforcement of every single line item (be it by-law, MNR, NRP, OPP, RCMP, etc).

The previous company obviously did not care for their health and safety record or the health of their employees (and I assumed every company was like that until I joined a company that requires extensive courses to be taken around this).  The new company obviously cares about their workers (or cares more than the previous company) and this could be a legitimate care, or it could be because any injury claims would impact their insurances, so they are giving people (more or some) training on what is acceptable and what they can decline and won't get in trouble for because they don't need anyone to get hurt.

Garbage cans are not standardized and this is a part of the issue.  A training program can be created but it can't be designed to fit every type of can people are putting at the curb because of the large difference in how they all operate/open or how they are designed to be lifted.

You mention the expectation is the collectors are lifting the bags out of the bins, but that takes more time than just lifting the bin and tipping it, especially if you need to fight with some type of vacuum seal that was created.  Also there are no requirements on garbage bag grades, so doing this with someone using the cheapest option will potentially result in the bag ripping and now there is a mess that people will complain about that they should have cleaned up.  Most people have no clue as to weight limits of the bags being used to start, just put stuff into it until it is full or it is garbage day.  Also lifting a bag out of a can increases the chances of getting nicked with something sharp with how the bag will swing.",t2_4mypp7mg,The-Raccoon-Is-Here,0,1648140857.0,0,t1_i1y9rj6,i1y9rj6,False,peptide2,t3_tm4waf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tm4waf/is_a_by_law_not_enforced_for_13_years_really/,Is a by law not enforced for 13 years really necessary?,/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tm4waf/is_a_by_law_not_enforced_for_13_years_really/i1y9rj6/,5,r/stcatharinesON,0,5

"Hi!

I’m not sure if you are male or female, but “Niagara Rec sports” has coed soccer leagues during the summer at various skill levels. Normally Sunday afternoon/evening games. You can register as an individual and be added to a team, or you can register an entire team.

If you are female, St. Catharines Jets has a recreational women’s division that plays Friday nights. You can register as an individual in this league as well. This is the league I play in every summer - it’s a lot of fun. Great mix of soccer and camaraderie. 

Both leagues have a cost to register, but the games have referees, are on decent city owned fields and you will get a jersey. 

Good luck finding a league, my soccer playing friend!",t2_15cjgb,evmcollins,0,1648001235.0,0,t1_i1qt4tr,i1qt4tr,True,ApeGad,t3_tjvcyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tjvcyk/soccer_st_catharines/,Soccer St. Catharines,/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tjvcyk/soccer_st_catharines/i1qt4tr/,1,r/stcatharinesON,0,1

"I understand the construction is necessary but CLV group is taking it to another level. I've been in this building for more than 4 four years only because of how low the rent is and where the building is located. I have gone through more than 3 different property managements that have done construction work in the building and Clv Group is the worse. They constantly work outside of time and not only me but other tenants complain to bylaw and management but it falls on deaf ears. As soon as CLV Group took hold if the building they removed all management from the property, this building has been around for years and this is the first they have not building manager. They make it an effort to have no interaction with tenants besides when they want money and that is the most frustrating thing. 

Right at this moment, they are not only renovating an apartment next to me, but they are also all doing my hallway, the apartment above me, and the garage below and lobby below me, PLUS they are working on the balcony and exterior walls so I am getting drilling from all angles at all hours of the day and I'm exhausted. My balcony and exterior walling were fixed less than 2 years ago and look perfectly fine but CLV is choosing to due this work again. We have community washers and dryers that don't work and they not once have tried to fix those.

"**[Sous vide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous_vide)** 
 
 >Sous vide (; French for 'under vacuum'), also known as low temperature long time (LTLT) cooking, is a method of cooking in which food is placed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and cooked in a water bath for longer than usual cooking times (usually 1 to 7 hours, up to 72 or more hours in some cases) at a precisely regulated temperature. The temperature is much lower than usually used for cooking, typically around 55 to 60 °C (130 to 140 °F) for red meat, 66 to 71 °C (150 to 160 °F) for poultry, and higher for vegetables. The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and to retain moisture.

"I wasn't doubting you at all, but the information the Health Department publishes is not for the masses on the whole based on their comprehension of the information.  I have see too many times people slamming places on various Facebook groups because of inspection results which they obviously don't comprehend.

If a hand washing sink has no paper towels or soap it is an infraction regardless of if that sink is ever used or not for hand washing, you could have 12 sinks for hand washing in your kitchen and one missing either of those items makes it an infraction.  One of the most common notes in inspections seems to be is ""Food is protected from potential contamination (e.g. food covered, labelled, off floor, sneeze guard)."" 

That above line item could be something as simple as putting a label with a date on the container than one of the ingredients is in, regardless of the fact it might be disposed of at the end of the day.  It really isn't cut and paste and the inspections are a snapshot in time.  I have seen reports issued to some operations I work alongside on grocery delivery day because a skid of food was not put into a fridge or freezer right away.  That will be noted as CORRECTED DURING INSPECTION, but again, that does not make the operation a poorly run one, just the inspector showed up at the wrong time.",t2_4mypp7mg,The-Raccoon-Is-Here,0,1647803494.0,0,t1_i1fs7ox,i1fs7ox,False,oooooooooof,t3_tikzjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tikzjr/best_all_you_can_eat_sushi/,Best all you can eat sushi?,/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tikzjr/best_all_you_can_eat_sushi/i1fs7ox/,1,r/stcatharinesON,0,1

2. Big Tuna.  Large selection of sushi and non-sushi.
3. Wind (part of Wind group).  Large selection of everything, sushi and non-sushi.
4. Seasons.  I have found this to be very hit and miss.
5. Sushi Paradise.  I have never had a great experience, but that might be me.

I do like the East in Niagara Falls over the St. Catharines location, as it didn't feel as crowded.

Generally the lunch menu is drastically reduced compared to the dinner menu as well.  From a lunch perspective I would take Big Tuna at the top of the list for sushi alone since you can get some sashimi.

Overall these all suffice for your sushi needs if you are looking for AYCE.",t2_4mypp7mg,The-Raccoon-Is-Here,0,1647797699.0,0,t1_i1fe9xz,i1fe9xz,True,oooooooooof,t3_tikzjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tikzjr/best_all_you_can_eat_sushi/,Best all you can eat sushi?,/r/stcatharinesON/comments/tikzjr/best_all_you_can_eat_sushi/i1fe9xz/,4,r/stcatharinesON,0,4

> Although out of their jurisdiction, a few bounty hunters crossed the border into Canada to pursue escaped fugitives and return them to Southern owners. The Provincial Freeman newspaper offered a detailed account of one particular case. A slave holder and his agent travelled to Chatham, Upper Canada, which was largely populated by Black persons once enslaved in the US. They were in search of a young man named Joseph Alexander. After their presence was announced, a large crowd of Black members of the community assembled outside the Royal Exchange Hotel. Alexander was among the throng of people and exchanged words with his former owner. He rejected the men’s offer of $100 to accompany them to Windsor. The crowd refused to let the men seize Alexander, and they were forced to leave town. Alexander was left to live in freedom.

"Thank you.

I don't think RSO contributed in negative way, but I think it didn't do anything. Basically, his symptoms only improved if he took the chemo pills from the doctor, but he only took them as a kind of ""last resort"" when his bloodwork and symptoms were really bad. He and my sister kept holding onto the belief in the RSO.

So, that belief in the RSO probably made him less likely to just follow the doctor's orders and take all the chemo pills as recommended.

It's not a good idea to rely on testimony that you read online about RSO, either. Only the ""success stories"" ever share anything. That said, I've read studies about cancer that said only about 37% of people who treated themselves survived after four years, versus 60%+ of those who did follow doctor's orders

"I had Rocco concrete do my driveway preCovid. Cost me $20k. Looked great. After the first spring, I noticed the surface started spalling and thin sections started lifting off.

This spring, I am noticing a lot of grit on the driveway which I suspect is more spalling.
