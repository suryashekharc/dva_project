The best swimming water in the Gorge is the Jump Rock near the suspension bridge on the Red.  Rock Bridge and Indian Creek are great for wading.  Indian Creek has trout in it.  Copperas Creek and the Clifty Wilderness is a great place to camp near water.  Just make sure you have a navigation plan in that area.,t2_4a4z4,tkeajax,0,1648217015.0,0,t1_i22e2ei,i22e2ei,True,OG-D,t3_tmukn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/tmukn2/looking_for_backpacking_trip_ideas_12_nights_to/,Looking for backpacking trip ideas (1-2 nights) to do with kids (6 & 9 y.o.) that would hit some cool spots,/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/tmukn2/looking_for_backpacking_trip_ideas_12_nights_to/i22e2ei/,1,r/RedRiverGorge,0,1

Definitely auxier ridge and double arch loop if you are going to backpack halfway through. Most people do it in a day but it is a moderately strenuous trail. I would suggest doing it backwards and starting with double Arch. From there you can a good view of the ridge you are going to hike to and then head down into the valley. Then I would just decide if you want to camp down in the valley or go up tonthe ridge and find a spot there. There are backpacking sites along the trail,t2_5ftecj5u,DeemOutLoud,0,1648162061.0,0,t1_i1zrbbw,i1zrbbw,True,OG-D,t3_tmukn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/tmukn2/looking_for_backpacking_trip_ideas_12_nights_to/,Looking for backpacking trip ideas (1-2 nights) to do with kids (6 & 9 y.o.) that would hit some cool spots,/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/tmukn2/looking_for_backpacking_trip_ideas_12_nights_to/i1zrbbw/,2,r/RedRiverGorge,0,2

"Rock Bridge is a pretty popular swimming hole at the Gorge, and you can do an easy walk or a strenuous/long hike to get there. Other than that, I don’t know if a ton of swimming spots in the Gorge. 

I’d suggest Grey’s Arch, one of the most impressive spots from a short (but moderate) hike with some decent elevation change. 

And Auxier Ridge is the other really popular one that would be good for kids. Since you’re mostly on the ridge line, it’s not too tough of a hike and would still leave you plenty of energy to tackle some other places. Just a word of caution though-it’s truly an open ridge at the end. Make sure your kids are careful. 

If you’re looking for a challenge, you can connect Auxier Ridge to Double Arch. We like going out along the ridge, down and back up through the valley to Double Arch, stopping there for lunch, then ending on the old logging road on the way out. Together it’s a 6-7 mile round trip and takes a few hours.",t2_5bnxxd1b,theporchgoose,0,1648157959.0,0,t1_i1zhbal,i1zhbal,True,OG-D,t3_tmukn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/tmukn2/looking_for_backpacking_trip_ideas_12_nights_to/,Looking for backpacking trip ideas (1-2 nights) to do with kids (6 & 9 y.o.) that would hit some cool spots,/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/tmukn2/looking_for_backpacking_trip_ideas_12_nights_to/i1zhbal/,2,r/RedRiverGorge,0,2

"This story comes from Don Fig's ""Tales of the Red River Gorge""

In the 1930's, a family consisting of an old settler and his two sons lived in a remote drainage of Laurel Fork. When the old man passed away, the sons made a coffin for their father and placed him on a horse hitched wagon to transport him to be buried. The route to the cemetery took them over a steep cliff which was difficult to navigate. An argument broke out between the two sons about whose horse could pull the most weight. While arguing, the coffin somehow slipped off the wagon and tumbled down the cliff. In a fit of rage, one of the sons pulled out his shotgun and shot the other, killing him. While waiting for the law in the days that followed, the son was so filled with remorse that he was driven to carve the events of what happened in stone.

The shotgun has ""J. Stevens"" carved underneath it, which is the model of the gun. Also profiled in the book but no longer there due to weathering and/or vandalism, several other carvings told the rest of the story. There was also a .38 revolver, a pocketwatch showing the time of day, and a hand/arm which represented the arm of the law.",t2_6eiqfujh,SharkeyFarmers,0,1647772143.0,0,t1_i1e09rp,i1e09rp,True,SharkeyFarmers,t3_tii57b,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/tii57b/a_modern_petroglyph_with_a_fascinating_backstory/,A modern petroglyph with a fascinating backstory,/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/tii57b/a_modern_petroglyph_with_a_fascinating_backstory/i1e09rp/,11,r/RedRiverGorge,0,11

Rockbridge is a great suggestion mentioned above. I also think that going to the chimney top parking area and doing the three hikes that start from there would be great. Princess Arch is a pretty good-sized arch with some area around to explore and chimney top is a very short and easy hike with a big overlook.

If you are looking to mitigate the risks being outdoors; snakes are very low on the list. Things like being unprepared for the weather, getting lost or off trail, getting dehydrated and not having basic first aid are the things that most people end up running into. 

Please understand that the red river gorge has a ton of cliffs with false ledges. The stone in the red is sandstone and the cliff edges erode into rounded edges. Leaves, pine needles, sticks and sand build up on top of these rounded edges and start to look like solid ground. Way too many people mistake this false edge for ground and end up walking out further than can hold their weight. As you can guess, it usually ends badly. 

There is a saying in and around the red. You know it is spring when the buckeyes (people from Ohio) start falling. 

&#x200B;

I don't say all this to scare you or dissuade you from enjoying the area. Once you are prepared it is an amazing natural resource.

"A lot of snakes will come out to bask during this time of year to start warming up, but still not a huge thing to worry about. You should definitely pay attention to where and what you're walking on, but not because of snakes. Copperheads normally dry bite, meaning they don't waste venom on you since they can't eat you. If they do inject venom, it's very mild. Should still be checked out by a doctor if bitten but its probably the least dangerous venomous snake in the US aside from a few that people don't even know are technically venomous.

Rattlesnakes on the other hand are much more venomous but the good thing about them is they will warn you 90% of the time, if you aren't paying attention. Which you should be. 

This time of year they will stay near their dens to warm up during the day and go back into hiding at night.

"I think you're spot on. Everybody is freaking out about these proposals. The fact of the matter is that the funding simply is not there to enforce any of this. At this point the proposals are exactly that; proposals. I still have yet to see any implementation dates or any explanation of where the resources will come from to make any of this happen. 

As you have pointed out, if illegal things are not being enforced now how will they take on that much more? I do a vast majority of my hiking off trail. I'm not worried about that going away. Like, who is going to be out there stopping people from going off trail? Prior to the 2008 recession, Forest Rangers were pretty common to see when out hiking. Since then, I have seen zero.

I think that implementing a day use fee is one of the only feasible options to generate revenue which is so badly needed. If people have to pay $5 to camp overnight, why not charge day visitors $2 or $3 each? It could be done on an honor system, which obviously some people would abuse, but most people I feel like would gladly pay a couple bucks to visit the Gorge.

"This is difficult to read, but RRG gets *global* traffic, and it is not a very large area. It’s a precious place and the law of numbers does threaten that. 

There is a ton of dispersed camping opportunities in the greater Daniel Boone National Forest, and I have seen many of the types of gems one might find in the Gorge through DBNF often without encountering a single soul.

I grew up exploring the Gorge, and I cherish those memories, but when I started working in ecology I started to see the Gorge in a new light. The footprint of degradation grew rapidly. Campsite “footprints” reaching for a 150 foot radius, which in many areas just means a whole corridor of heavily impacted forest and riparian zone. New tree recruitment basically disappearing because people want a good hotdog stick. The amazing subcanopy species being crushed to death.  White nose fungus decimating bat species found *only* on RRG, and soooo much erosion, which has a myriad of cascading effects on both the water and land systems. It’s no question that many parts of RRG have been and are being loved to death.

This solution is honestly much better than capacity limits and reservations like a lot of high traffic wild areas in the west. Even the best Leave No Trace practices leave their mark if you introduce enough people.

These delicate systems *can* be pushed over a threshold, and something has do be done to protect such a special place. As much as I dearly love exploring, there are much worse regulations than “please stay on the trail.” And there are so many amazing trails just outside of RRG where you can do that with a fraction of the  compounding impact!",t2_hjvsg0vl,xylem-and-flow,0,1644516021.0,0,t1_hwe9o4v,hwe9o4v,True,tstanley21,t3_spatyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/spatyi/proposed_plan_to_rrg/,Proposed plan to RRG,/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/spatyi/proposed_plan_to_rrg/hwe9o4v/,23,r/RedRiverGorge,1,23

"Hello, I thru-hike the Sheltowee in October 2020, hopefully I can help shed some light!

-First off, there are definitely some obvious spots to camp along the trail. Anywhere with a firepit and a flat place that is cleared out is a surefire sign for a campsite. 

-However there isnt always a site where you need, so you may need to do some improvising. Familiarize yourself with Leave No Trace, and be sure to be respectful of the environment (not trampling plants or foliage, proper bathroom practices, etc.) But it is pretty easy to find places to camp. You are supposed to go 300 feet away from the trail but sometimes if it were a weekday in a remote area and it was getting late I would just pitch my tent (a narrow single person one) right on the trail and break camp down first thing in the morning. Just be sure to be respectful and follow all LNT and local rules.

-If you havent backpacked before 15 miles seems like a lot to start out. Hiking 15 miles is one thing but carrying a heavy pack makes it harder. I would start with about 10 miles to begin, and ramp it up from there if it goes well. If I recall the first section from from the northern terminus to Morehead is about 30 miles, that would fit your 3 day increments well.

-About that first section; if I recall that was one of the areas that was quite sparse on campsites. This was one area I camped directly on the trail and then hiked down to Morehead for the next night. Just be aware some of this area is residential. I think at one point you even hike through a cow pasture!

-As another user mentioned, the TABA thru hike guide is a great resource. It marks a lot of good campsites and water sources. Although keep in mind it is a bit outdated, I left another comment in regards to that. 

-I used the same maps that you linked, they were great. In combination with the TABA guidebook I never got lost.

-There are also a few other notable places to stay that I would recommend, Miguels Pizza is a must, also Lago Linda, the lodge at the Cumberland Falls, Motels in Morehead, and also a very nice Trail Angel named Paul Rose in McKee is building a cabin for thru hikers to use.

-Another point, definitely contact the trail angels!! They are amazing and will be happy to help you out, be it shuttle service, help with resupply, even lodging in the case of Mr. Rose.

"Copperas is definitely a good hike in the snow with little to no elevation change. Besides the falls there are lots of little side features to see. The only problem is getting there. Sometimes the roads in the Gorge are well maintained, sometimes untouched. You just have to kind of play it by ear. If the main roads are okay but the roads in the Gorge are bad, there are some spots on the outskirts you could stick to. The spaas creek and Indian creek areas can be accessed via the Stanton exit. The rock bridge area is easy to get to, but the bridge on 715 going back over the mountain parkway can be really slippery, even if the rest of the road is okay. Tunnel ridge road should drivable too, just depends on how 15 is between there and the slade exit.

"Hiking alone is great.  It's nice to go at your own pace and enjoy the solitude.  Don't let the weather deter you either, try to take the appropriate clothing if you can, but even if you don't have it you can still do some drives or some short hikes (just leave a towel and dry clothes in the car!

If it doesn't rain too much or you do have decent wet weather clothing, then do some hikes.  Plan ahead and find appropriate trails for the conditions.  Look at maps and get an idea of the area, waypoints, trail intersections, things like that if you're nervous about getting lost.  Use a offline gps tracking app that you can just reverse your tracks if you need to.

Most important: Inform someone of your plans (parking area, trails you're hiking, a time when you should be out, a time for them to contact help if they don't hear from you).

If you enjoy it you can invest in a satellite beacon that can call for help if you trigger it, but at a minimum for the weekend that's what you should do to be safe and enjoy some solo hiking.

"Absolutely. I am just trying to gauge what temps to prepare for. Like I know what the average lows are, but if half the days are 10F and half are 40F, the average temp is a very tolerable 25F, but that is deceiving. I should prepare for 10F since I am equally likely to see that temp. 

Contrast to 20 of 30 days are 25F, and 5 are 40F and 5 are 10F. You still have the same average temp, but it is far more reasonable to prepare for 25F and just be mindful of the weather ahead of time.

"Sweet! When I was out that way last month I visited rattlesnake arch but no others. Is it possible to descend down into that valley from the end of the Raven Rock overlook trail?

I'll have to look for deer climb next time I'm out there.

I haven't made it out to Grant's yet. When I visited flat iron a few weeks ago I went to the end of indian creek 9A but I didn't even attempt it.

"The  byway is easy to follow this time of year. There is really only one spot that can get you turned around. It is right past the saddle back ridge and at the top of the uphill there. The trail will create the high point and there is a really big pine in the middle of the trail. Bear right there to stay on the byway. A left will take you to a fabulous overlook and actually a way down to the road(albeit an adventurous way down). Past the saddle back ridge the trail is very easy to follow and was used in the past by the FS to access the top of the ridge that runs along with he road. If you venture off of the main path to explore be cautious. A lot of blowdowns and many are not stable. It is an absolutely fantastic trail imo. Several arches, good views, some cool rock scrambling, and some isolation from the crowds. We have seen coyote on several occasions up there also. It is also possible to go all of the way out to the end near Ravens rock and make your way down to the ridge base. There is a user trail but most of  it is on private property.

"I like everyone’s advice here.

 I have been known to hike in areas, typically less travelled/few people, and my trust my dogs off leash. But this only came with years of working off leash on private land and they still aren’t perfect. It was hard to trust scouts backpacking for the first time in the gorge because, as stated, the perils abound if you don’t adhere to proper etiquette and keep your vigilance. You will see others with dogs off leash and that is another issue. The gorge is not the place for that. For that dogs’ safety and that of others.

I would also like to echo the comfort in strange, new environments with possible triggering sounds through the night. I can’t take one of my dogs camping because they are too ‘on alert’ they are a bark-incessantly-ask-questions- later type and that doesn’t bode well for anyone, whether in campgrounds or backcountry.",t2_4pnhyr3q,go1dfodder,0,1636991601.0,0,t1_hkqcfep,hkqcfep,True,Rmilly18,t3_qtwt5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/qtwt5w/camping_advice/,Camping advice,/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/qtwt5w/camping_advice/hkqcfep/,2,r/RedRiverGorge,0,2

This decision will just drive a large number of people into a low number of crowded and  cramped spots (which will fill up months in advance on-line), taking away much of the ambience and enjoyment of current isolated camps.

I think there are too many of the wrong people coming to places like this now. There are too many that treat it like a theme park and not like a national forest. It is not just in the gorge, it is every one of the 21 national parks I’ve visited in the past 5 years. 

Another one of my pet peeves is people that bag their dog’s poo, and then just leave it on the trail. You did step one! Why couldn’t you do step 2? It’s more of a tax on the system there to leave the bag, then just let the poo decompose.

You are right that we should all want it preserved and Kept in its natural beauty. I agree with that. I think my biggest fear is that this would be less about actually preserving the gorge and more about “bringing it into the 21st century” and controlling where you can go and what you can do. I was there two weeks ago and there was someone with an iPad at the trail head doing surveys about what attractions people would like to see there and how far you traveled or would travel to come. With every restaurant and zip line that goes up I fear it’s going to become the next Gatlinburg.

"I don’t think it’s ever “crowded”. You have to know it’s there and you have to work to get there. I’ve only been up there twice and only stayed the night there once. I was the only person both times.

Go to Double Arch and then take the little side trail that goes up on top of the arch. Once on top, there’s a path that goes towards a spot that gives you a great panoramic view of the gorge below. Don’t go that way. :) Go the other way, into the trees and towards the rock face that goes up. Climb up the rocks. It’s sketchy and I haven’t found an easy way up, especially while wearing a pack. Once you’re up there you’ll find a trail leading to a fire pit and some spots to camp. You can’t miss it.

"Oh man there’s so many good ones! You are going to have a blast! These are my recommendations:

Copperas Falls-there’s a beautiful waterfall at the end and the whole trail is like something out of Jurassic Park. 

Auxier Ridge-miles and miles of endless overlooks and ridge line views. Truly a remarkable trail.

Whittleton Arch Trail-omg this is another Jurassic park-like trail (not as much as Cooperas) but it’s soooo much fun. Bridges abs little waterfalls and great big trees. Def try to hit this one even if it’s on your last day. 

Hanson’s Point-this is a good one if you are going to backcountry camp. The problem with day hiking it is you won’t want to leave once you are there. The view is like nothing words can describe. 

Martin’s Fork-if you want to play among large boulders and towering rocks, this is the trail for you!",t2_pc0pk,wanderlust0526,0,1636255929.0,0,t1_hjmubr1,hjmubr1,True,bernsdork7,t3_qm3bla,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/qm3bla/fellow_rrg_hikers_i_am_going_to_the_gorge_soon/,Fellow RRG hikers!

"If interested, I detailed how to get there in a past comment. See below:

Parking at the first lot on Tunnel Ridge on your left, take the trail for Pinchem Tight. At the first fork, stay right. If you go left, you’ll be headed towards Grey’s Arch.  
  
Keep hiking for a bit before coming to another fork. Go left. If you stay straight at the fork, you’ll be on Buck Trail.  
  
Another half mile or so you’ll reach a sandy intersection with a downed tree good for sitting. You want to go left here, essentially doing a “U-turn”. You’ll descend a little before hiking back up. Nothing terrible. Towards the top, you’ll notice a clear trail on your right. That will take you to Hanson’s. If you miss it, you’ll start to find yourself heavily descending towards a creek. Turn around, you’ve gone too far. The trail to Hanson bobs and weaves among a “tunnel” of pines and brush. It’s very unique and cool as shit.  
  
Hanson’s can be confusing solely because of the enormous “campgrounds” you encounter along the way. The first you come to you want to hang right. Find the trail as it goes along the perimeter. You’ll come across some smaller campgrounds before reaching the last enormous one before the overlook. This can be very tricky to navigate. Stay left, follow the dirt trail that traces the large downed tree.  
  
Come to a few more small camp spots, stay left. Descend until the rock face is in view. You’ve found it. Be careful and enjoy a nearly 360 degree view of the gorge, quite possibly the best lookout the Red has to offer.",t2_5pvilmmu,Big_Vomit,0,1635972420.0,0,t1_hj74iuo,hj74iuo,False,bernsdork7,t3_qm3bla,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedRiverGorge/comments/qm3bla/fellow_rrg_hikers_i_am_going_to_the_gorge_soon/,Fellow RRG hikers!

"Gray's Arch may be a little longer than you are looking for but it is a fairly short hike and is definitely a good bang for your buck. It is also on Tunnel Ridge Road which is not much of a detour from the highway so thatll help make up the time difference. A lot of the other hikes require 20 to 30 minutes of driving once you get off the highway to get to the trailhead. You could also do chimney top rock and/or princess Arch. Those are fairly short and you park in the same parking spot for both of them. Chimney top rock is probably the easiest ""hike"" in the gorge and princess is super easy as well.

"Depending on what type of camping you are doing there are some options. If you want to do some backpacking wildcat trail (hard) has some nice options or even Copperas Falls (easy) has a couple of spots. If you want to be close to your car but not a campground I highly suggest Indian Creek you can find spots within 40 feet of your car plus you are next to the creek! Finally if you want a campground there are a few Koomer, Tunnel Ridge, but my favorite is the Red River Gorge Campground. It is about 10 minutes from the Gorge on the Red River, but do call ahead to get a nice spot. 

As far as what to bring bug repellent is a must. If you are doing any hiking good socks and boots go a long way. My biggest tip download the all trail maps BEFORE you get there because you will lose service. I grew up 5 minutes from the RRG and still can get a bit confused when hiking the trails. As far as food just leave it in the car. The likelihood of seeing a bear are low but not unheard of. 

Also it is copperhead birthing seasons (seen four last weekend) so be cautious. If you don’t know what they look like take some time to google it. The babies are more dangerous than the adults. However, the biggest danger are the cliffs so watch your steps and stay on the trails.

Here's a link to the hike on toredrivergorge.com. It's pretty vague but there is a helpful waypoint on there.

Once you reach the confluence of Clifty Creek, you can also go a different way by crossing Clifty Creek (staying on the same side of the river) and picking up a user trail on the other side. That short trail leads to an old logging road on the left that parallels the river after it bends.

"Yes. But the cliffs are sometimes pretty dangerous for a dog who isn’t used to the terrain, and people/dogs do fall from pretty high places every year. 

In addition, there is a pretty big snake population in the area, they are much heavier in certain places than others, but it’s definitely something to be aware of with a dog. I’ve camped in places there with no snakes at all, and other times it seems like I chose a spot where copperheads lived and bred.

Yes but keep them on a leash as there will be plenty of other dogs on the trails and major cliffs and drops offs depending on where you’re at.

"If you are worried about someone getting too close to the edge, I have two ideas that spring to me.

1) go through Nada Tunnel and find a place to park right along the river, and play in the water (am I right, this is along 715?). If it is a nice day, it could be WAY TOO BUSY along the river.

2) very far from Nada, but flatter/lower/safer - Rock Bridge trail (Usually lower left of gorge maps). Might be a little far, but you wind down to the river, and to my memory, there are fewer places I would worry about a little one falling. This might be less crowded, just because it is a little more out of the way.

"Should be a great weekend for it! One of the most popular destinations in the gorge is Chimney Top rock, and for good reason. It's a flat, easy quarter mile from the parking lot to the viewpoint. It will be crowded but a good place to take a kid. You also have princess arch nearby which is another short, easy hike from the same parking area and well worth seeing. Sky Bridge is another quick little hike to an amazing arch that you can walk on top of and below. I highly recommend this one. Besides those, Tower Rock is about a mile loop around a big, interesting rock formation. No spectacular viewpoints but not much elevation change there. All of these hikes are along or right off of HWY 715 (chimney top is a little further off 715, about 5 miles) which would allow Nada Tunnel to easily be part of the route.

"So I hiked this last night and camped out on the trail.  It was as described. Muddy and lots of horse trails and even an atv track on the back stretch.  

To me improving this trail and creating some more camp spots could be a way to space out the traffic in the gorge. Just seems like a little tlc would go a long way in bringing people out this way.  

FYI I could not find several of the side trails for camping listed on the outragis maps. The trails coming off the Right then left when starting from The road entrance that does not have the parking lot.  Could spot either of those.

"I almost used Tunnel Ridge Rd Trail L from  Hinterlands as my ceremony trail, but ended up going with another unofficial trail. It’s a campsite trail with a nice overlook at the end, at the Pioneer parking area on TRR. It’s very much a microcosm of the whole gorge… ridge top, rhododendron holler, pretty forest, etc. but nice and short. You should hike it to make sure your grandma can do the last part bc the ground is sloped, soft, and covered in pine needles at one point. Be warned that it might be HEAVILY used in peak fall season by actual campers—wherever you plan to have your “ceremony,” you may want to consider setting up camp the Thursday before and holding the spot.

"I'd suggest ordering the Hinterlands book folks sometimes mention in this group as it has all the info you'll need *re* the various trails.  Of all the RRG books i've bought these last 3\~4 years since i'd started visiting the gorge again, the Hinterlands book is the best.  It'll tell you all the pertinent data about each trail, including distances, elevations, what you'll see there, a difficulty rating, etc..  


I don't know what to tell you regarding the gear, sorry.  That first summer i started going again i'd get down there and hike for the day, sleep in my car in one of the lesser-populated parking areas, and then get up to start hiking for maybe half that day before driving back home to Cincinnati.  Then there were a few trips where i tried the hammock thing, just wasn't for me.  Earlier this summer i stopped at a department store on the way out of town and picked up a $25 little tent w/ rain cover and a sleeping bag for i think $15, so i'm happy to be getting back into camping again.  That rain cover worked a charm a couple weekends back, incidentally -- it rained so long i got rather bored sitting in the tent reading a book -- but i sure was nice and dry!  I plan to ditch the sleeping bag for the next trip and use a rolled-up sleeping mat and a light blanket instead as i figure it'll be more comfy and reduce my load a little.

&#x200B;

Oh, and i always bring what i assume will be more than enough water as it often turns out to have been just the right amount somehow.  A Duraflame or other sort of fire-starter log is nice to bring alone.
