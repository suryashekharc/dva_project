"Just because Patricia Cabral doesn’t want to accept or deny our registration and just because Jessica Edwards wants to nitpick over her interpretation of the 330 CMR does not mean that we should be penalized any longer by their behavior. The overreach and abuse of authority has done nothing except make the MDAR look like they hate guinea pigs and that they don’t know what the 330 CMR laws actually are.

So, in regards to everything that has happened over the past seventeen months, we are asking that:
1. Patricia Cabral sign our registration paperwork so that we are a registered rescue
2. Jessica Edwards passes our inspection upon completion of the quarantine room
If these conditions are not met in a timely manner, we will be backed into a corner because we are not going to be able to keep the Sanctuary going. That being said, we will have no choice but to use our attorney (Kathleen Reagan) to bring charges against Patricia Cabral, Jessica Edwards and the MDAR.
However, we are trying to stay positive and, we look forward to resolving these issues once and for all.

"Here is the email we sent out to 22 people on the state, town, and village levels. Feel free to share this information.

We are sending this email to everyone who has been involved, or should have been involved, so that everyone has the same information.

The Guinea Pig Sanctuary is a community resource, emotional support guinea pig sanctuary. We work with many families throughout the community to provide information and emotional support. Our ESGP (Emotional Support Guinea Pig Program) provides guinea pigs to anyone who is on the spectrum or in need of an emotional support animal. We are completely supported and funded by the village of volunteers throughout the world.

Throughout this fight with the MDAR (March 2020 to present), there have been many inconsistencies, illegalities and straight out attempts at bullying and harassment against the Sanctuary.
Patricia Cabral has been breaking the MDAR laws by not officially responding to any of our registration filings within the 90 days as stated in 330 CMR 30.04 (3). This states, “The Department will send a confirmation notice to the applicant indicating that the application was received and shall issue an approval or denial of the application within 90 days after the date of such notice.” We filed it several times. The first ‘received’ registration, as verified by an email by Patricia Cabral on August 14, 2020, shows that she received it but was not going to answer the registration request until ‘early 2021’ and, that she didn’t want us to do any advertising or adoptions until after she decided it was time to review it. She also includes that ‘the licensing portion of the regulations would not be implemented until early 2021’ and that ‘the Department will notify the rescue when it implements filing of the required plan’. We were never notified of this implementation. This means we would have had to have our business closed until ‘early 2021’ which was not an actual date and goes way past the 330 CMR ’90 days’.
Patricia Cabral verbally (via phone) threatened to have the Director arrested, threatened to hit the Sanctuary with a cease-and-desist order, and threatened to call every Animal Control office in the state to say that it was illegal for the Sanctuary to take guinea pigs from them. That was the last time we heard anything until September 17, 2021, when another volunteer was CC’d on the registration (again) to prove that it was done. The volunteer then had to call Patricia Cabral to prove it was received by her office. Patricia agreed that yes, she received it but then, never responded to the filing. Right after that, Jessica Edwards showed up. Mind you, Patricia has never even been to the Guinea Pig Sanctuary.
Jessica Edwards did her first inspection on September 15, 2021, which was a day the Sanctuary was closed (as advertised on our website and the front door), instead of coming during normal business hours as stated by the 330 CMR. She brought four people with her that visit (Fire Marshall, Animal Control, Animal Rescue League, and Building Inspector). They spent two hours here. Then they all left. About an hour later, Jessica and Diane came back for another two and a half hours. Everyone had passed us on that inspection except for Jessica Edwards.

On September 28, 2021, Jessica Edwards called the landlord with misinformation about ammonia levels without actually checking the ammonia levels and bypassing the Sanctuary’s attorney. She also did not provide the guidelines or proof for the levels of ammonia. We did our research and found the ammonia ppm level allowances and also bought an ammonia meter to conduct our own readings to make sure we were within the legal limits. No place in the Sanctuary was over 2.7 ppms which means we were well under the guideline allowances. Jessica also mentions ‘the poor air quality’ of the sanctuary, which is subjective because she made no air quality measurements or testing either. 

On September 28, 2021, someone from the MDAR also went as far as telling Sophia LaCortiglia, 1st Essex District Aide, that we were not in good standing with the IRS or the Attorney General’s office. Both of those accusations were proven to be outright lies as we have had our 501(c)3, since September 2018, and we have been listed on the Attorney General’s website since May 26, 2021 (which was originally filed on August 20, 2020 but was delayed due to Covid). 

On the second visit, November 18, 2021, Jessica Edwards showed up again and brought another inspector (Ali Thompson) and a representative from the Health Department (who gave no name) and none of them wore masks. There is a big yellow sign posted outside, in front of the sanctuary, that clearly states masks are required to enter the sanctuary. The ‘Health Department employee’ also did not give us anything officially and instead used a commanding tone several times saying, “this is not allowed”, when referring to the small non-perishable food pantry at the front door. We ended up just closing the small food pantry, much to the dismay of the elderly community and families that use it for basics (peanut butter and jelly, etc.). Jessica Edwards had come in to do another inspection, even though she had previously stated (via email) that she would schedule a second inspection after we notified her that the quarantine room was finished. This visit was over two hours long. FYI, the quarantine room is almost finished.

Jessica Edward’s official written report for the first inspection, done on September 15, 2021, was not provided to the sanctuary until November 29, 2021. That was two and a half months after the initial inspection and, after Jessica Edwards, along with Ali Thompson and a man who only identified himself as “part of the Health Department for the town of Salisbury” performed a second unannounced inspection on November 18, 2021.

Jessica Edwards has used several variations of the 330 CMR (based on her interpretation of the laws) and has done this through a variety of emails which shows her ineptitude at understanding guinea pigs and borders harassment. We have a binder filled with emails to prove this and a volunteer also created a complete timeline of the events that have happened, based off of the emails that have been going back and forth. 

Jessica Edwards has called our landlord, the Fire Marshall, Animal Control, Building Inspector, and the Health Department on the Sanctuary. Even though she is legally allowed to do this, it has become harassment as all the above had previously passed the Sanctuary on their inspections except for the Health Department person who is still unnamed and who has never provided an official order for removing the food pantry.

Jessica Edwards “suggested” the Sanctuary shut down, euthanize the guinea pigs, and then try to find a more ideal location. She also tried to make the Director unwrap deceased guinea pigs that were in the freezer and even tried to get the Health Department’s approval for this. 

The Guinea Pig Sanctuary has never received anything officially from the MDAR, the Shelter and Rescue Division, or the Inspectors until the first inspection report, which was received on November 29th, after the second inspection.

We invite everyone to stop by and see all the improvements we have made. If you have not been to the Sanctuary, here is the link to the latest walk-thru we did on November 30th, 2021.

The Sanctuary is in a warehouse that has fake walls to create rooms. It is an indoor barn environment as the guinea pigs go through 2-3 bales of hay a day. Timothy hay is 90% of their diet. Next to us is a hair salon. Above us are residential apartments. We are also located next to a marsh. We have spent over $50,000 to adapt this space to what we do and $19,000 of that was just to build the quarantine room. The quarantine room has one more contractor visit and a building inspection clearance and then it will be finished. The plumbing portion of the room was almost $7,000 as we were required to use all copper piping. The town plumbing inspector and the town electrical inspector has passed and cleared what has been done in renovations so far for the new quarantine room.

We have immediately and consistently responded to everything asked from us with no issues from any state or town departments except the MDAR, specifically Patricia Cabral and Jessica Edwards. Anyone who has officially ever been in here legally would have the power to shut us down if we were a bad rescue. That has not happened because the evidence is not there. Nowhere, at any time, have we been accused of or found guilty of any type of mistreatment or neglect of the guinea pigs. Even by Jessica’s own report, there is nothing that says the guinea pigs are not well cared for, well fed, or clean. We have tried to comply to almost everything Jessica Edwards has thrown at us, however, she keeps changing the requirements and it seems to be a never-ending battle.",t2_f27ibvfi,bunniessodear,0,1638467602.0,0,t1_hmyi68t,hmyi68t,True,bunniessodear,t3_r7d0f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/northshore/comments/r7d0f5/please_help_the_guinea_pig_sanctuary_in_salisbury/,Please help The Guinea Pig Sanctuary in Salisbury keep their doors open!,/r/northshore/comments/r7d0f5/please_help_the_guinea_pig_sanctuary_in_salisbury/hmyi68t/,1,r/northshore,0,1

That’s very cool that there’s a guinea pig sanctuary around, I had no idea. But your post could use a bit more info 


Edit: found the petition, whoever wrote that is salty as fuck. Maybe it’s warranted but it looks bad from someone who’s just getting a peek into the sanctuary and the petition. Sometimes you’ve got to rise above those doing you wrong and it seems they’re stooping.

It sounds some stuff went against regulation, and the sanctuary is mad now that COVID is easing up and they’re now being forced to follow regulations. I could be wrong but that’s how I interpreted the details of that petition


This is so not how you get regulators off your ass lol:

"I lived on North St. from 1980-1985, it's a great little neighborhood. My back yard backed up into Klock Park, which was pretty cool. As a kid, I loved having that space for riding my bike or shooting model rockets. 

The baseball and soccer traffic wasn't bad at all. In those days it was really only on the weekends and not intrusive at all. The thing that we did not like about that street is the fact that one end of it connects to Rt. 1, so you end up with a fair amount of ""cut through"" traffic from people looking to take a shortcut from Rt. 1 to Ipswich road. However if things are still the same now as they were 40 years ago, that road is pretty heavily speed trapped. 

I will include that in the winter my friends and I would play ice hockey on the little pond across from the end of Boardman Ln., and when I was even younger, we would sled down the hill onto that pond.

"Yeah, unfortunately the pandemic shut us down before we could show It's a MMMM World, as well as took our 2020 film season right out from under us. In fact, what we'll be showing on the 18th is technically the 2020 film festival.  I talked to the film directors, and they were all good about the idea of showing the festival as soon as it was viable. Many of them are just happy to have their films showing. A number of festivals dumped their entire lineup and started over in 2021... or never recovered.

I'm going to see what I can do about getting It's a MMMM World up some time in 2022. It probably won't be the first movie to appear in the lineup.

"Even with a short drive it can be hard to get a spot at sandy point unless you arrive very early in the morning. 

Options-

Get up v early to get all the way to Sandy point by no later than 7. It is about a 20 min drive from the entrance gate at Parker River reservation by the way. Super popular with people and only about 20 parking spaces. Parking is free at Sandy Point. 

Or you can park in Lot 1 in the Parker River Reservation which remains open year round. The other lots are currently closed for nesting birds. Lot 1 is immediately thru the gate on the left. Bathrooms there. Probably will still be spaces at 8-8.30-9am or so. I would guess around 80 spaces? On the beach you can walk north about half a mile and get an ice cream or hot dog or something at the stores. Vs Sandy point which has no facilities. $5 per day entrance.

Or you can pay around $20 for a day parking pass at one of the places at plum island center - near the stores as you drive onto the island. 

Or you can go all the way to the North end near the lighthouse where there is a large parking lot. I think around 150 spaces for something like $10? But i would absolutely not recommend the beach at the river. This is the mouth of the Merrimack river and people often drown because the current is so treacherous.

Our son goes to an ELC (not in the areas you described, but elsewhere on the north shore) and we are at $85 per day.  
Edit: Also important to note that some daycares charge a fee to apply.

This place is great! Small business with an owner who pays well and takes genuine care of his employees. I personally never worked in lawn care before working here but I have had experience working in greenhouses and out in the field (though neither is necessary to pick up this trade). The guy who trained me is fantastic and got me up to speed in doing the work pretty quickly. You primarily work autonomously/individually which I found empowering. It’s also nice to know that you don’t need to know everything right away and you’ll learn and keep learning as you go. C’est la vie. Took away a lot of good practical and specific skills for life too. 10/10 highly recommend. Not to mention just the shear good walking/physical labor/vitamin D you get just from working.

"People shit on lynn on all the time, but it’s an old perception issue. In the 80s/90s it was as bad as everyone made it out to be, but over the last 20-25 years it has become far better. We are the biggest city in the county and one of the biggest in the state, so crime should be expected especially being so close to Boston. But the people outside the city only ever hear the bad news, which amplifies their negative image of the city. There’s a ton of good happening in the city with tons of diverse restaurants, a growing arts scene (murals everywhere), etc that doesn’t get talked about and is overshadowed by the crime and violence, which is frankly not as high anymore.

Lynn has nice beaches, a great wooded area, and many parks. I’d say there’s no shortage of outdoor places to visit in lynn, maybe more than those other cities. Lynn woods, Red Rock Park, & high rock tower are favorites of mine to visit to get outside and walk around. There are free outdoor concerts every summer (in non-covid times) the friends of lynn and nahant beach put on that are really good and absolutely fantastic for a night at the beach. Lynn woods has tons of great natural trails and lakes. It is also pretty big, it’s actually bigger than Central Park.

That being said, the schools aren’t as good compared to some other spots and there aren’t a ton of entertainment options in the city. Salem and Beverly may be better for a walkable downtown with a decent amount happening and places to visit, and I quite like both cities (except Salem in October). I’ve only lived in lynn so can only speak for here, but I honestly feel like every city has its positives and negatives. At minimum I’d recommend some visits to here.

"IF the walking thing is big for you guys - Salem.  None of the places to walk in Lynn (short of the beach) are places where there is a thriving market area, and Beverly is a little spaced out for that.

Commute wise though, sure it sounds like it's easy to Boston, but it's going to be 60-90 minutes both directions, if you're doing public transport, sometimes longer.

Beachwise, Salem and Lynn are better than Beverly - Swampscott and Nahant have both bigger and littler beaches, plus the Salem Willows area - and they are easier to get to from Lynn and Salem than Beverly.

School wise, avoid Lynn, we are over populated, and under resourced, and the citizens feel like building new schools isn't a priority for our tax dollars.

"I grew up a bit further north but had friends in Beverly and Salem. Since then I've spent some time in Lynn, not a ton. Beverly is the ""nicest"" of the towns. Definitely has the best schools, and given the big money in Beverly Farms area, schools are likely to stay nice (those rich people pay property tax whether or not they send their kids to public school). I moved here with my family about 6 years ago and have been very happy here. It is significantly more expensive than either Salem or Lynn property-wise, but I don't know about renting.

Salem is a great small city. Lynn is the next on the list of cities to be gentrified. Both have rough spots, Lynn definitely has more, but both have (or had, I haven't been to either since the plague started) vibrant downtowns, good restaurants, bars, breweries, and stuff to do. I would say both have larger downtowns than Beverly. 

All three are on the commuter rail. Beverly Depot is the last stop before the line splits, so that's something to be aware of if you're looking in North Beverly. Salem and Lynn are not good cities if you plan to commute via car, but you can easily do so by train. Salem and Lynn are hard to drive to, and hard to drive out of.

I think Beverly is the most convenient in terms of access to Cape Ann. It will be easier to check out the rest of the area. It’s got like 4 commuter rail stops and great highway access.

"All are reasonably good choices, with different trade-offs.

Lynn will be the cheapest, but comes with a bit more sketch-factor in some neighborhoods and a bit more difficulty in getting in and out to major highways when needed. A lot of people around here (especially the more white suburban types) talk about it like it's a damn war zone, but while it is objectively higher-crime than the other two (by a decent margin), plenty of people live there without a problem.

Beverly has a nice walkable downtown, but the town extends a long ways and gets very suburban and residential away from the center pretty quickly; a feature if you want that, and a drawback if you don't. The schools have a reputation as being better than Salem, but I've heard a *lot* of dysfunctional stuff coming out of their school system in the last few years.

Salem is by far the most walkable of the three in terms of getting from residential areas to stuff (except for a few of the further outlying areas in Wards 4 and 7). The traffic sucks, but can be worked around if you have some flexibility in your schedule. If you don't...well it just sucks. Don't move here if you get frustrated at being overrun with tourists. The schools have a terrible reputation, but my kids have had nothing but great experiences in elementary and middle school so far.

Right now, I park at Wonderland, but the 442 runs right through— frequently. As does the 445 (I believe, don’t quote me on this number) to Wonderland through the Lynn area. It’s the most inexpensive as far as purchasing a pass, and the Blue Line is hardly ever crowded.

"I've lived in a lovely house in Lynn for the last twenty years and worked at Harvard for around six years, almost never remote.

I won't talk about the commuter rail much because it was hard for me to keep to its schedule and I found it more stressful than worth it.

You at least have a bunch of options - the bus to Downtown Crossing that drops you a 5 minute walk to Park Street is pretty good, if the bus is convenient. The bus is annoying and slow, though.

I would also take the bus to Wonderland and then the blue line to State. From there, I'd walk to Park St and hop on the red line.  I liked the walk through Downtown Crossing.  This is usually a pretty good commute, under an hour rarely, usually about 75 minutes.

The eventual ""best"" commute I found was to drive to wonderland, take the blue line to state, walk to Park and hop on the red line there.  It gave me flexibility, I enjoyed the walk through Downtown Crossing, and I could more easily meet my family places or do errands because I had a car.

I eventually thought about my commute from Lynn into the city in terms of the fastest way I could get to Wonderland, because from Wonderland you've got multiple options into the city and it's not a ridiculous cab ride if you need one.",t2_6gkb6,djcp,0,1610404157.0,0,t1_gixo29w,gixo29w,True,WhiteHawk1022,t3_kv3rxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/northshore/comments/kv3rxy/commuting_from_lynn_to_cambridge_via_public/,Commuting from Lynn to Cambridge via public transit,/r/northshore/comments/kv3rxy/commuting_from_lynn_to_cambridge_via_public/gixo29w/,5,r/northshore,0,5
"I'm glad I could help.  I love the North Shore, and living here has been great, but the toxicity that builds up from just being helpless on a train for 5h of *premium* waking hours a day when, inevitably, things happen that need fixing or kids need to be picked up, or there is housework that needs doing, or any of the number of things that go with being a family... it is really difficult.

If I worked for 8h (it was always more) and slept for 8h (always less) and commuted for 5h... I got 3h (*maybe*) to try and hold together the fort at home.

Thanks so much for sharing all of those details. The commute is certainly one of the biggest factors in our decision. I was primarily a bike commuter pre-pandemic so the North Shore would be a *drastic* change.,t2_8olkv,WhiteHawk1022,0,1610388890.0,0,t1_giwqp79,giwqp79,False,WhiteHawk1022,t3_kv3rxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/northshore/comments/kv3rxy/commuting_from_lynn_to_cambridge_via_public/,Commuting from Lynn to Cambridge via public transit,/r/northshore/comments/kv3rxy/commuting_from_lynn_to_cambridge_via_public/giwqp79/,4,r/northshore,0,4
"I took the train from Haverhill to North Station for about 7 years and the sheer amount of time that it took (~2h15 minutes from my door to my office door at the Arlington stop on the Green Line) was *oppressive*.  Taking 5h a day to get to and from work was 5h a day that I couldn't spend with my family and it was, ultimately, pretty terrible.

In retrospect, I would have preferred to have lived closer, and been more poor or to have paid for a parking space (and been much more poor), than to have given away a literal *year* of my time with my family (~364 days, 24x7, spent on trains) when my kids were growing up.

That was my experience at least.  My advice would be to factor in all of the variables... if you can walk to the train in Lynn vs driving to the train that adds usually a minimum of 15 minutes to your commute, not to mention the challenge of finding a parking space (which costs $$) and in the winter, clearing out your driveway just so you can even *drive* to the lot...  A house within walking distance is probably $10,000 more (?  I have no idea, I would assume that is a perk that adds value)... That $10,000 will feel pretty cheap if you are getting up at 5am to snow blow your driveway year after year just so you can fight for the last spot in a crowded lot.

On the plus side, I got in a ton of reading, and since I did all this before the internet was in our pockets, I didn't have to do very much in the way of IT work on those trips... and I was able to get an hour or so of sleep in on either end.

"The competitiveness is super frustrating. Definitely stressful to try to make decisions like this on such a short timeline. 

Public transit in the Boston area is in general very good for an American city, but the biggest downside is that it is not connected efficiently. So you have instances like yours where the North Shore would be an awesome commute if you worked at MGH or Government Center, but having your office be only 3 miles away essentially doubles the commute. Whereas living west of the city is great to get to Harvard, but can be awful if you work in the Seaport. 

So essentially your geographic options are limited in order to get a good commute. This is made even worse if you consider spouses working in different parts of the city, or trying to account for future job changes. 

Another option is to look in the Quincy/Braintree area, since taking the red line from there to Harvard is only about 30 minutes. The one downside is that there is no alternative route, so if the red line is delayed, you just have to wait it out.",t2_gje5q,ehMac26,0,1610380126.0,0,t1_giw50ma,giw50ma,False,WhiteHawk1022,t3_kv3rxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/northshore/comments/kv3rxy/commuting_from_lynn_to_cambridge_via_public/,Commuting from Lynn to Cambridge via public transit,/r/northshore/comments/kv3rxy/commuting_from_lynn_to_cambridge_via_public/giw50ma/,3,r/northshore,0,3
">If that is a dealbreaker for you, Watertown, Waltham, and Brighton are much more convenient to Harvard Square and should have some houses/condos priced similarly to Lynn.

Thanks, the commute is definitely our biggest concern.

"Just crunching some numbers for fun here:

Danvers is 93.8% white with a 1.8% Asian population (not broken down by country of origin). (Source: [https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/danvers-ma-population](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/danvers-ma-population)). The total poplation of Danvers is 27,631. (Source: Id.). So, the TOTAL Asian population of Danvers is about 500 people. I am guessing that the number of Singaporeans in that 500 people is very low. But I can't find good data to sort it out.

For some guidance, we see that the ENTIRE Boston MA-NH Metro area has 185 Singaporeans (125 of them over the age of 21). (Sources: [https://archive.vn/20200214004351/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10\_SF2/SF2DP1/310M100US14460/popgroup\~086](https://archive.vn/20200214004351/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF2/SF2DP1/310M100US14460/popgroup~086) \[found via Wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean\_Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_Americans)\]). I am guessing a huge amount of those are in Boston/Cambridge. But for the sake of argument, lets assume that those 125 adult Singaporeans either live in Danvers (population 27,631), Boston (population 694,583) or Cambridge (population 118,977). Let's further assume that the population of Singaporeans is evenly distributed amongst these three towns (meaning: assume the same ratio of Singaporeans to the total population is the same in all three places). The percentage of the people that live in Danvers (assuming the total population is the population of Danvers, Boston, and Cambridge) is: 27631/(694,583 + 27631+118,977) = 3.3%. So, using my assumption that the number of Singaporeans follows that same percentage: 3.3% of 125 is 4. So, we expect 4 Singaporeans in Danvers.

That is probably an over-estimate because, as I said above, I think assuming that the population of Singaporeans follows the same percentage as the total population is incorrect. And we are squeezing the entire population of the Boston-Metro area into three towns, which also results in this number being an over-estimate. It is far more likely there are less than four (zero?) Singaporeans in Danvers.

EDIT 1: It wasn't fair of me to only count the adult Singaporeans in those numbers. If you use the full 185 Singaporeans in the metro area, my estimate is SIX (6) Singaporeans in Danvers. But, again, my assumptions make that an over-estimate. I think zero is a much more probable number.

EDIT 2: Based on the overall low Singaporean population in the US, I think you are better off casting a wider net than ""Danvers."" Here is a Singaporeans in Boston and New England Facebook group: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/SGatBOS/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SGatBOS/).

"Rowley is nice.  Small town and pretty rural for Eastern Massachusetts.  Within driving distance of some decent food options (American Barbecue in Rowley, Clambox in Ipswich, Woodman's in Essex, Sugar Magnolia's in Gloucester).  Good hiking in Georgetown-Rowley Forest. Not far from the beach.  Probably as affordable as you will get that close to the ocean.  Schools are ok, but not outstanding. Go to one of the Masconomet High School sponsor towns (Boxford, Topsfield, Middleton) if you want that and can afford it.  Think about Georgetown (next to Rowley) if your looking for similar affordability and better schools (but further from the ocean).  

Take your kids to the Topsfield Fair when it resumes in 2021.  Great fun from toddlerhood to high school.

"I grew up near Rowley - it is GORGEOUS. Your kids will love playing in the wooded trails there, minutes from the beach, Hellcat Swamp is a wonderful nature reserve... I really can’t say enough great things!

I didn’t go through the school system there but my dad and his relatives attended Triton and only had good things to say. My father particularly is brilliant and very well educated. So hopefully nothing major has changed with the quality of education since then, can’t speak to it directly. 

One issue - mosquitoes and ticks. Some years are worse than others but Rowley is so deeply wooded that you will have to deal with them. Learn how to do tick checks (these things are tiny!), consider treating your shoes and socks with pyrethrum, and keep mosquito spray around. Also, greenheads. If you are anywhere close to the marsh they will bother you terribly, you really just kind of live with it. 

These are literally the only downsides though.

"Depends if you want lab made diamonds. Keep in mind that at first glance you can't tell a real diamond from a lab made diamond, however, if you actually look closer the lab made one will be so shiny it doesn't appear natural.

I ended up getting an engagement ring from Etsy. So many options. I couldn't find great jewelers in the area, though I really would have loved to worked with a smaller business.

We ended up getting our wedding rings from Summerwind Jewelers in Portsmouth, NH. They were really nice and willing to work with us on price, and you get a free sizing as well.

As for what ring to get, well that's something you have to decide. Consider questions like how important is the diamond size? Does she even want a diamond or would another stone make her happier? Does she like something Victorian? Is she sensitive and only wear something small and skinny, or is she someone who wants it flashy and big? You've gotta know, and if you don't, then really start paying attention as she talks about fashion/jewelry, or throw out some feelers.

Over everything else, remember, it's not the ring she's marrying, it's you.

Good luck, and congratulations!

"A part of the reason our unemployment number is higher than other states is because of the comparative competence of our unemployment office.

"Dude's a troll. I definitely see where you're coming from, but you've got to try to relax a bit. As much as we'd like to control other people's behaviors, it's an uphill battle. A group of 5-6 unmasked people in a parking lot shouldn't be too much concern, and I agree that calling the cops probably won't do anything. But I like where your mind is at. If you see a group 10x that size in a public setting then I would tend to agree that informing the police would make more sense.

Problem here is that people are tired of this pandemic, and many people are getting more relaxed about it. ""No one I know caught the coronavirus and if they did, nothing bad happened"" is a commonplace sentiment today (in fact, that's a true statement for me but I'm much more pragmatic about this situation).

"I wouldn't say Beverly is ""ritzy"" on the whole. Beverly Farms absolutely is, but Beverly overall is one of the more affordable towns on the coastal North Shore. Marblehead, Swampscott, Manchester, Rockport, Ipswich, Essex, Newburyport, Hamilton, Wenham, etc. are all more expensive than Beverly. Salem is honestly just as expensive as Beverly these days as well, and if you want to be right downtown in either Salem is actually more expensive.

The reality is simply that the coastal North Shore is really expensive in general. The only places that are cheaper than Beverly are Gloucester, Lynn, and Salisbury essentially. Maybe Rowley and Newbury?

Unfortunately there are a lot of young immature people around because of the colleges but if you avoid certain venues you will be fine. There is not a ""big city, small town"" attitude there.
