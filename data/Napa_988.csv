"Shouldn't be getting turned down for new either way? It's tragic. The thought of carbon footprints getting worse while cars are daily advancing towards electric vehicles. It's not forward thinking from Napa. Turned down 8 to 12 million in sales revenue yearly between the two of them... The hype in the beginning sure will cause traffic jams and cause congestion... But that is what in n out does daily already. It would spread this distribution of people using drive thru around not add to it. Let's face it .. people aren't coming to Napa for a chick FIL a.

I can't see why this is a problem. The environmental effects will happen regardless. Those same people still don't have time to sit down and eat... They'll just choose a different line. To turn down that much tax money... I believe that is why raising cane's got turned down.. but for chick FIL a I believe they got turned down due to their anti LGBTq stance. Which is just insane amounts of tax money to turn down.. I worked for the 3rd highest grossing chick FIL a in the country.

"George Altamura definitely took part in the destruction of town. Making everything so ridiculously expensive does the same thing though. Everything changes, however what Napa has become is not what good change looks like. Pricing out the people who built it is not good change. Sure restaurants have to survive, however an average $20 appetizer and $40 entree is just asinine, especially when the quality does not match the price. Which has been a california issue since the recession. Taxes should be lowered, especially since its obvious  infrastructure sees none and it all goes into private hands under the table via tax funded art projects all over downtown napa. Rent should be capped for both commercial and residential to allow middle class the chance to actually be able to live properly.

Napa does have incredible roots, but the roots are so buried and forgotten that Napa has not changed for the better. Like the rest of California, it will be just for the wealthy and everyone who isn't will be struggling for pennies. Napa and the whole state has destroyed itself.

"My husband and I own an insurance brokerage here in Napa. It's almost impossible to write new homeowners policies. One of our carriers simply refuses any homes in 94558 and another won't accept an address within two miles of a previous burn border, even if it's surrounded by concrete. Clients who are currently insured with companies like Nationwide and Travelers are getting non-renewed, which means they have to go elsewhere at the end of the policy term. If they're lucky enough to keep their policies, the premiums are commonly doubling.

Unfortunately, the only solution for 99% of people is the California FAIR Plan with an accompanying Difference in Conditions (DIC) policy. The FAIR Plan is known as the 'insurer of last resort' and ONLY covers losses due to fire, no liability/theft/etc. which is where the DIC comes in. Yes, it's expensive. I wrote a FAIR policy yesterday that's $5,000/year for $800,000 in rebuild, plus a DIC for another $1,000/year. This is for a 1500 square foot home in Angwin, 94508.

"The Other Side of Napa's Walt Ranch vineyard controversy:  
  
There is a great deal of controversy and confusion surrounding greenhouse gas emissions and real property rights as to the Walt Ranch vineyard development project on their 2,300-acre parcel.  After addressing and resolving all other issues, Napa’s Board of Supervisors upcoming March decision has now shifted to one single remaining concern: carbon sequestration and forest re-growth.  The County has now delayed their December vote to confirm a previous favorable decision of the developer’s planting of vineyards.  It appears the owners, Craig & Kathryn Hall, have done everything possible to comply with the County's mandate to provide a clear plan to address climate concerns from the vineyard’s proposed conversion of 14,000 trees for 209 acres of vines on 316 cleared acres.  
  
Napa is well known for its outsized share of activists that have alarmed the community with reporting of misleading information surrounding watershed, oak woodlands and long term strategic plan. Having said that, the battle to stop Walt Ranch continues. Everyone agrees that public policy should be based on lawful property rights, conservation with reliance on fact-based science.   
  
I would like to offer “the other side” in defense of the Hall's plans for their property. I've never met Craig or Kathryn Hall, however, know of their many contributions to Napa, charities and our community.  
  
Their project is being opposed by people concerned about vineyard projects in the watersheds, groundwater and the possible loss of oak woodlands.  Last Tuesday’s meeting delayed the vote on 209 acres of vineyard development with over 15 years of expert environmental consultant costs and county fees as a result of opponents alleging a conflict of interest by a Supervisor and lack of carbon sequestration mitigation.  If approved, Walt Ranch will be the most expensive 200 acres ever developed in Napa County.  
  
At the heart of the Hall controversy is the clearing of 14,000 oak trees to plant vineyards.  Virtually the entire Walt Ranch oaks were destroyed in the recent fires. Having said that, the county still required mitigation for greenhouse gas emissions as if those trees were still there. So as to mitigate this clearing the Halls have agreed to preserve 124 acres of woodlands and to plant 17,852 new trees, and revised their plan to include a conservation easement of at least 1,000 acres for oak woodlands. Scientific fact: fire promotes acorn germination and growth by reducing competitive pressure from underbrush vegetation, releasing soil nutrients, reducing litter-born pathogens, or improving contact with mineral soils.  From US Forest Service:https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw\_gtr217/psw\_gtr217\_551.pdf    
  
After the 2017 Napa fires, nearly 14,000 acres of fire-damaged trees in Napa, Sonoma and Lake Counties were tagged for removal, according to Cal Fire statistics with more than 20,000 acres of private forests cut in 2018, a number that continues to increase as landowners (myself included) are still clearing the fire damage. Post fires, Napa oaks surrounding our watershed have and are returning in substantial numbers.  Again, virtually all Walt Ranch trees burned in the 2017 and 2020 fires.  
  
There are ecological benefits that follow because fires create a regenerative land.  Reforestation is nature's way of assuring carbon sequestration and forest re-growth.    
  
The county has reviewed the Hall's plans “with a fine-tooth comb” at substantial costs to taxpayers. Opponents shouldn’t mistake the strict agricultural protections with their desire to simply stop vineyard development.  Opponents should consider that California has a 150-year history of legal principles regarding the ownership of real property wherein “property in a thing consists not merely in its ownership and possession, but in the unrestricted right of use, enjoyment, and disposal.”  
   
Regard for another's real property doesn’t seem to matter when you are inciting outrage, along with a massive publicity campaign to condemn the Halls and their legal rights. In the end, the Halls will have spent a considerable fortune for a non-existent threat.  An example of misleading false information by one of these opponents can be found in the following statement published in the Napa Valley Register:  “The science is solid and long settled that all watersheds in Napa County have impaired water quality from human land activities providing undeniable evidence that a yes vote on Measure C is justiﬁable. Sadly, Napa residents, including children, suffer the highest cancer rates in the state.""  
   
Measure C failed. As to highest cancer rates, once fact checked, this proved to be false and a gross exaggeration: American Cancer Society rates Napa as ranking 28th in California’s County cancer list falling virtually in the middle of the pak.  As an example, our neighbor, Solano County has a 14.5% higher cancer rate.   
  
Napa Planning Director David Morrison was absolutely correct in that decisions must be science and fact-based on absolute truth and accurate evidence versus fabricated, inaccurate and distorted misrepresentations:  https://napavalleyregister.com/opinion/letters/facts-are-important-in-strategic-plan-process/article\_67aad01e-62e2-5666-b9e3-7ff04accaba4.html.  
  
If the activists and opponents disagree with the science and facts, then they should buy the vineyard property themselves.   
  
I contend the county’s Supervisors have acted fairly, properly and fully addressed all of your issues.  
  
I thank the Supervisors and the Planning Commissioners for leading a fair and common-sense approach to the issues facing our community, including a focus on Napa's economic health, agriculture, family vineyards and wineries, while balancing growth with protections in a fair and legal manner for all of Napa’s community. Thank you for using science and fact-based information in your assessment and vote.",t2_9dnxtee3,Interesting-Mud-2589,0,1645743614.0,0,t1_hyb1u7c,hyb1u7c,True,greenwizard,t3_sprxoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/napa/comments/sprxoi/supervisor_alfredo_pedrozas_fatherinlaw_revealed/,"Supervisor Alfredo Pedroza's father-in-law revealed to have bought more than 400 acres adjacent to the Walt Ranch project in May 2021, hearing delayed due to conflict of interest",/r/napa/comments/sprxoi/supervisor_alfredo_pedrozas_fatherinlaw_revealed/hyb1u7c/,1,r/napa,0,1

"If you can spend two full days in each location, with a full travel day between each location, that will work. Ideally you would not be driving to Yosemite on a Saturday or Sunday, because the traffic heading up to Napa on a weekend is ridiculous. Also, do not come to Napa over the May 27-May 29 weekend. The Bottlerock concert will be going on and the place will be a parking lot - with those spots going for at least $50. If your late May trip is not that weekend, and you have a full day to travel, head north across the Golden Gate Bridge and stop for the photos/view on the far side. Get to highway 12 where you will see beautiful vineyard covered hills. A number of wineries to choose from. A great place for lunch is the Boon Fly Cafe. You could continue on hwy 12 and skip downtown Napa, making your way East to Hwy 5 and Stockton, on the way to Yosemite. What you don't want to do is get to Yosemite after dark.

"Remember that Napa is always testing a new ""branding"" program to enhance its rep. Unless you stay here for a while you won't know how much of what you're told is reality or part of the latest brand.

Downtown is not the quaint, organically grown location it's supposed to resemble. It is the culmination of some years work by a handful of developers buying up and demolishing or just rebuilding it into the Anthropologie-like downtown you see see. (The earthquake helped, too.)

This is what will happen: Industry workers will live in tiny apartments and townhomes while the upper class will have real ""suburban"" homes and second homes.  Forget the middle class.  They're pushed out.  They'll live in communities outside of Napa with affordable housing.   

Anyone who lives here knows it's already happening!  Schools are closing, families are moving en masse.  Nurses, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and anyone in the middle class are becoming endangered species.

"Depends on what you want.

I'm a bit of a wine person so different stores have different strengths.

Raley's in South Napa is probably the best intersection of quality selection and pricing.  It won't have cutting edge stuff but selection is good and pricing is nice on 6 bottle purchases.

Back Room is a really nice shop especially for the discovery of niche Napa and Sonoma producers - but their import choices are also pretty unique.  I consider them one of the best all-around shops in Napa proper.

Bay Grape is a newer addition, the expansion of an Oakland shop.  Their focus is a bit more new-wave than other local retailers - the selection is a bit more somm-y, natural and cutting edge.  You can expect to find a fairly one-of-a-kind selection here with less bias towards Napa/Sonoma.  Also from what I can tell, the service and inclusive culture of Bay Grape is considered a real strong suit.

The selection is a bit more narrow, but the high-end picks at the Oxbow Wine Merchant are really excellent.  I think their top-end imports are among the hardest to locate in Napa and you can tell that good European wine is their passion based on the selection.

A little bit further away is V Wine Cellar in Yountville.  This is a place that is focuses on only the highest-end selection and I'm sure they cater to a well-heeled clientele.  Pricing is not always sharp but they have access to things many other shops can't source.  Primarily domestic.

In St. Helena, there is Gary's in the old Dean & Deluca space off 29.  This is a very good selection and everything seems priced at market norms.   In particular, I think they have the largest import selection I've found in Napa County.  They are the expansion of a New Jersey retailer which does a fair amount of internet business.

There are other shops that have strengths and weaknesses - Bounty Hunter, Napa Valley Wine & Cigar, Wine Country Connection in Yountville...

There are some high-end shops upvalley that I've never visited - K.Laz in Yountville and Acme in St. Helena - but I've heard they're good at what they do.",t2_cq7pt4vq,StereophonicWine,0,1642799748.0,0,t1_htnheep,htnheep,True,paddletheprimate,t3_s76blx,https://www.reddit.com/r/napa/comments/s76blx/best_wine_shop_for_locals/,Best wine shop for locals?,/r/napa/comments/s76blx/best_wine_shop_for_locals/htnheep/,3,r/napa,0,3

"When you find a good wine, get to know the producers because sometimes there are deals. Call the winery. Ask where they sell it. Knowing what you want is most of the battle. Costco is the lowest cost for what they carry. The wine buyer at Grocery Outlet is very savvy, and is a very good buyer. You will see he is getting some great deals.

"My fiancé and I moved up here 1.5 years ago. She is from napa originally, and we wanted to move back to be close to family, and start one ourselves. I did a lot of research before moving here, and I can tell you that the reality is a bit different than what was portrayed in our research. For one, Napa is a lot older than we had expected. I think median age is listed as something like 38. That might be true from the census reporting, but I don’t think it takes into account the transient nature of most of our neighbors. Our first year we lived in town, and a lot of the people living around us had their primary residence elsewhere. San Jose, San Francisco, Berkeley, etc. Napa is a weekend getaway for them, and while our street was quiet, it also provided little in the way of community. We joke that Napa is boomerville. 

The housing market here is also nuts. While it appears to be more affordable than places like SF or SJ, the houses are often older, and need a lot more work than we had anticipated. We toured some time capsules in browns valley that needed complete gut jobs and still, they sold for over asking in days. Unless you can bid 10% over, all cash with no contingencies, home ownership is tough, and the rental market is incredibly difficult. Our first landlords decided to sell 6 months into our lease, and we almost left Napa simply because we couldn’t find a suitable rental. We were usually touring rentals with 3 to 5 other parties who were all rushing down to the rental office afterwards hoping to get their apps in first. It took a few months of searching, and hundreds of dollars in application fees before we finally found a place. 

From what we gather, the public school system in Napa is nothing special, and for elementary browns valley is the place to be. While we liked browns valley, it’s not really walkable, and the price of housing was higher than neighborhoods in Bel -air or closer to town. All that to say we are leaning heavily towards moving out of Napa. We really thought it would be a great place to raise a family, but we have learned it’s not really for us. Don’t get me wrong, the valley is beautiful, and if you are into food and wine you probably won’t ever get bored, but I’m not sure it’s as family friendly as it’s sometimes made out to be.

"Schools are quite good, though as anywhere your kids’ experience will depend on which of the teachers they get (great and less than great teachers at every school). Two dual immersion elementary schools are great. Skip the private schools here though. 

Also a mixed race family here, very happy we connected with the Rainbow Action Network (RAN) which has regular and awesome family events that are quite diverse (and always fun, purposeful). Browns Valley neighborhoods vary almost block by block but some areas are more diverse and others fly ”Let’s Go Brandon” flags. I’d walk the block before buying, maybe around 5:00-5:30pm to see who’s coming home from work, get an idea of what the neighbors are like. I love the lack of any car traffic on my block, gets more diverse every year as original owners are moving away (usually because of health). 

Walk-ability is poor unless your near downtown (or in Yountville or near the Bel Air plaza). But bike-ability is GREAT! I’m downtown on my bike in 12 minutes, home in 15 (slight uphill on the way home). Same trips by car are about 10-12 minutes. Biking to the grocery store is very quick. The ride (car or bike) to Bel Air shopping is not bad at all, and they have: Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Target, and good Peet’s coffee all in one spot - it’s very convenient for families. Food Shed across Trancas is also great for family dinner pickups.

"While we could absolutely use young families relocating here (Napa's getting expensive to live in and the general population is aging), I'll be honest, I don't think you're going to find everything you want in Napa.

The school system is okay quality but in a bit of a uncertain situation as enrollment drops. A lot of schools, both public and private, are closing. The teachers are good, and do the best they can, but they're limited by the resources available.

To give you an idea of demographic diversity, just a little under half the households in Napa speak Spanish at home. There isn't a lot of intersection between the Anglo and Hispanic population in every day life, but all the kids end up together in the schools at least. Unfortunately, there's really just the two main ethnic groups.

Walkability will be tough. A few spots that have what you need will be Brown's Valley (the Market is a bit of a high-end grocery store and on the pricey side, but it's surrounded by a couple restaurants and a dentist, and the Elementary school is nearby), the Riverpark neighborhood (though there aren't any schools nearby), and Downtown (same problem as Riverpark, but much more expensive).

With all that said, I would be glad to welcome you to Napa if you think it'll be the right fit.

"The Indian Hot springs is worth the price! I was just there Jan 5th. I go every year for my bday. U can check in before ur room is ready and go to the hot springs. Also the day u check out u can pack ur car and still soak untill midnight. That three full days of soaking! They have bike trails, hiking, fire pits everywhere, and just an overall immersive experience. 
BUT if your just coming for the day u can't do Indian Hot springs as due to covid they are a two night minimum. This, ur best option is Dr. Wilkinson's. I think the super soak is reasonable and amazing. Hopefully u get the 6 foot tall guy for a massage. He is incredible!! 

Also, if u have time hit up the town museum. It's worth a look. I always find something new and interesting to see there.

"* **St. Helena**
 * Market - Good food and drink. Best fish and chips I've had (now that Silverado Brewing Company is closed, but some of the staff went to Market). Cozy space. 
 * Giugni's - Great sandwiches with a very good signature sauce. 
 * Pizzeria Travigne (it'll always be Tomatinas to me) - Good pizza and Italian. The garlic rolls are a must have.
 * Gott's Roadside (formerly Taylor's Refresher) - Been a bit since I ate there, but I'm obligated to recommend it since a friend is the manager. Much better than the one in Napa, from my experience. Milkshakes are **thick**.
 * Velo Vino (owned by the Clif Bar family) has a good food truck focusing on bruschetta. 
 * Not quite a restaurant, but Model Bakery is pretty well known. Been a while since I ate there, but it's worth mentioning.
 * Also a little out of scope, but Woodhouse has great chocolates.
* **Napa**
 * Dutch Door - Nice little pick-up-and-go place off of 1st. Sandwiches, hot dogs, etc. I'm rather fond of their Korean fried chicken sandwich. The staff has always been quite pleasant in my experience. 
 * Napa Noodles - General asian foods, largely noodles but also curries and such. Good food. The bao appetizers are fantastic. 
 * Chetuphon Thai - I've only been there once so far but have been trying to go back. The small sampling of food I had was pretty nice. The rotti ice cream was delicious. 
 * Foodshed - Pizza, pastas, and some other stuff, nice little desert cabinet. Their sandwiches are my absolute favorite. Using pizza bread works really well. 
 * Oxbow is an obvious inclusion. Lots of good food in a wide variety. Fairly well known, I think. The Fatted Calf has some really nice sandwiches. El Porteño Empanadas are pretty tasty and convenient. C Casa is pretty nice mexican food. 

I haven't eaten out in Yountville or Calistoga in ages, so I can't really offer any recommendations there. 

I wish I could still recommend Miminashi, but sadly they closed down last year. Absolutely fantastic Japanese food.

"These aren't the ""musts"" per se, but its what I'd do if I was in your shoes. Skip the city of Napa and drive up highway 29. For food, id go for Don Giovannis for great Italian food, or Bistro Jeanty for french food (Bourbon is actually better but pricier). Smaller wineries over the big ones are usually they way to go. I love Sequoia Grove's red wines and they have an awesome little tasting room and outdoor area. Others will have more winery recs for you, but I'd suggest staying away from the big guys, Beringer, Mondavi, Mumm, Charles Krug, etc. Castillo di Amorossa is a beautiful castle, but also quite a tourist trap, so it has its pro's and cons.  Also make sure you call days if not weeks in advance to any winery or restaurant you decide on to make reservations as some wineries are appointment only.

"Hi there -

Never any snow to worry about and not much elevation unless you are staying on one of the surrounding mountains.  We have been getting a fair share of rain this year and I know the highway from Sonoma to Napa has closed due to flooding at least once this year.  Sonoma is about 20 minutes from Napa, so not a horrendous commute.

There might be more to do in Napa, although I can't say for sure since I don't live in Sonoma.  In Napa, there are several places to hike (Skyline Park, Westwood) and plenty of places to bike.   There is Robert Lewis Stephenson park which is close to Sonoma.  Tennis courts should be plentiful in both spots at the resorts, etc., and I am sure there are public courts as well.    I know it can be difficult to find rentals in Napa, but I have seen places advertised specifically with visiting nurses in mind on Craigslist in the sublet section.

I hope you have a great stay and explore the area.  The North Coast of CA is really spectacular if you have a long weekend to check it out.  The redwoods are incredible, as well as Mendocino area and Fort Bragg.  It's a bit of a drive to these areas but if you have two or three days off, definitely worth it.

"Are you talking about the city or the county of Sonoma? The commute is 20-30 minutes from the city of Sonoma and it is a beautiful drive through vineyards. The famous Windows XP background was photographed along highway 12 in the area. 

Ice happens sometimes but it  isn’t a constant worry— California winters are mild in comparison to other parts of the world. The risk of snow is almost nonexistent (I’m sure some Napa native can share the story of some wild storm in the 70s or something). If you are driving in from other parts of Sonoma County like Petaluma or Santa Rosa, the commute is a bit longer and that can get annoying, but usually not treacherous. It’s usually an easy drive that sometimes gets complicated by accidents and weather.

There are plenty of hiking trails and mountain biking in Napa, Sonoma and the surrounding areas.

"Much of the bureaucratic red tape you're citing is nonsense, and has not stymied development in other California cities.

Sustainable, affordable growth is feasible and necessary.  I suggest our council look to the models created by other Bay Area communities such as Dublin (https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Dublin-is-once-again-California-s-13882869.php), which is among the fastest growing cities in CA.

"Sadly you are correct that we're seeing the local decimation of the middle class in Napa County. I'm not sure there's any way to spare the good that we have while also creating a livable environment for the real locals. I was born and raised in Napa in the early 80's so I've seen the drastic changes up close.

Things to keep in mind are building costs, environmental costs (both on the ground and those associated with CEQA), costs for government planning staff time (likely several agencies would be involved), and the need to fund more of all the essential services (water, sewer, fire protection, EMS, police, street lighting, storm drainage, sidewalks, public parks, schools, etc.) to accommodate any significant urban development. Did you follow the Napa Pipe project planning process? It took about 15 years and the end result is under 1,000 new homes to be added to the local housing stock, and who knows when they'll actually be constructed?

I know it seems like it should be easy to just say ""housing is a crisis and needs to be the #1 priority"" but how and where does it get done? Do you have any suggestions?

"Absolutely agree. And as to snarky who says the Ag Preserve isn't sacred, of course it's not. It can probably also be toppled in court with a concerted effort (paid for by developers.) But this round of housing numbers, even if it's shifted to 100 rural units this time, will increase again during the next cycle. So where do you squirrel away the next 150 units? And how many housing units can really be shifted to the city of Napa, cycle after cycle, until the residents get seriously angered and refuse? Tell the county to stuff it and build the units they're assigned in the county? Ask any resident who must cross Hwy 29. Trower, Trancas and Wine Country have all had a minute added during commute times to cross the hwy (4 to 5.)  That extra minute has meant some ridiculous traffic lines waiting to turn, sometimes lines extending onto hwy 29 itself.

I’ve read and reread everything I can find on the story and things are not adding up at all. 

What happened to the food that she supposedly ordered? Why did the roommate not knock on her door when the food arrived? 

The boots and umbrella that belonged to her that were found by the river, she probably gave those items to her homeless friends because of the storm. It sounds like she did nice things like that often. They aren’t exactly a sign that she must have went in to the river. 

Some guy commented on the FB page saying he thought he saw her wandering around town looking depressed on December 16th. Something tells me this girl isn’t just out there hiding from everyone, intentionally creating a missing persons case for attention.

We know that she did not have a car, so she didn’t drive herself away. She had to have been lured into a vehicle and taken away, and for someone to be able to do that without causing a scene, it seems like it would have been someone she trusted enough to willingly get into their car.

"Need to be careful with Celiac. The tolerance thresholds vary between people but generally it's quite low (PPM measurements versus grams or ounces). What this means practically to a person that does not have celiac but will dine with/cook for someone with celiac is cross-contamination in the cooking environment matters. This can take the form of sharing fryers, sharing ovens, sharing preparation tools (knives, spatulas, etc...) with things that contain gluten (wheat, rye, etc.). A lot of restaurants will outright tell you that they cannot guarantee complete separation of gluten in the kitchen, even with gluten free menu items. On a positive note, restaurants making these types of statements also signal that the industry is aware of the challenges involved, which is probably a lot more comforting than a blanket assurance that a pizza can just be prepped with gluten free crust or that they'll swap out to a chickpea flour for their fryer for your dish.

Grocery shopping still will get you into a car or a reasonable bike trip (CVS, Walgreens, Grocery Outlet very close by, Target, Raley's, a bit further; but Whole Foods and Trader Joe's are a couple highway exits to your north but still less than 10 minutes away). 

Safety is good, though like nearly any city you'll want to be a bit cautious if out late. You're less than 5 minutes from the Napa Police department and there are a fair number of sheriff's deputies working at the Courthouse (also very nearby). The churches near Nation's provide some food aid for folks so you'll see some down on their luck people, but normally nothing to concern yourself with regarding safety. More foot traffic than Browns Valley or Alta Heights, but that comes with being closer to downtown and it's good food and evening fun (Uptown, Blue Note, etc). 

Near you is Grace's Table - a great lunch or dinner spot. More to explore downtown for sure.

"At least two suspects were being sought by Napa Police on Thursday at Alston Park following a shooting that left a man hospitalized.

The attack took place at the park off Dry Creek Road at about 3:40 p.m., and led to a police investigation that closed off a section of the road at the park entrance into the night, according to Sgt. Omar Salem. A Napa man suffered multiple gunshot wounds that were not considered life-threatening, Salem said.  
  
The shooting victim was found outside a liquor store in the 2000 block of Redwood Road, just under two miles southeast of Alston Park, before he was taken to a hospital, according to Salem. After receiving information of the location of the attack, officers went to the park at 2037 Dry Creek Road and found spent casings there, he said.  
  
There was no threat to public safety as of Thursday night, according to Salem, who said the shooting is believed to be gang-related.

A short stretch of Dry Creek Road was sealed off with yellow caution tape from Trower Avenue north just beyond the park entrance. A white police crime scene unit van was parked curbside, but little activity was visible as night fell, except for dog walkers leaving the park and passing through the cordon.

The roadblock was expected to remain for several hours into the night, Salem said. Police issued a Nixle alert asking people to avoid the park area during the investigation.  
  
Anyone with information about the attack is asked to contact Napa Police Detective Kevin Skillings at 707-257-9466.",t2_4td2aypy,DangerStranger138,0,1638594913.0,0,t1_hn5ulgo,hn5ulgo,True,juaquin,t3_r7rdnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/napa/comments/r7rdnn/napa_police_seek_suspects_in_shooting_at_alston/,Napa Police seek suspects in shooting at Alston Park; man hospitalized,/r/napa/comments/r7rdnn/napa_police_seek_suspects_in_shooting_at_alston/hn5ulgo/,1,r/napa,0,1

"Fruit flies are usually hatched inside the home rather than coming from the surrounding environment. The most likely source is some produce you brought into the house, didn’t wash immediately and then left out on the counter where the eggs that had been laid at the grocery store were able to hatch in your home. Immediately washing any produce that’s not going to be refrigerated is a good strategy for preventing them, in my experience. For now, removing potential sources of food (no produce on the counters or other uncovered food) from them for the next couple of weeks as their life cycle plays out and comes to a close should help along with the other suggestions people have made.",t2_229i1vta,darkhorse00000,0,1638101450.0,0,t1_hme58ob,hme58ob,True,msyxx3201,t3_r3re4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/napa/comments/r3re4n/fruit_flies/,Fruit flies,/r/napa/comments/r3re4n/fruit_flies/hme58ob/,1,r/napa,0,1

"What appeals to me about AV/RCV is that any sufficiently large interest group can get together and vote as a bloc.

Take your top issue as an example:

I suspect people who want the city to be tough on crime are spread out across all four districts. But with AV/RCV, you could get together and elect a city councilor whose top priority is being tougher on crime.

Plus — and this is where I think it really shines — you can vote for multiple councilors. So if you have a second or third pick who generally agrees with you but doesn’t think crime is as high a priority as taxes, you can support them too!",t2_32up2,gcnovus,0,1637716588.0,0,t1_hludj9u,hludj9u,False,gcnovus,t3_r0268i,https://www.reddit.com/r/napa/comments/r0268i/election_reform/,Election Reform,/r/napa/comments/r0268i/election_reform/hludj9u/,1,r/napa,0,1

"I'd love to hear more about this perspective!

Do you feel like Boudin's views fall far outside the mainstream for San Francisco?

My understanding of AV/RCV/IRV is that they tend to promote candidates who hold consensus views, but may not come from the traditional political establishment. Our current system, first-past-the-post, promotes the opposite. The _spoiler effect_ means that elections come down to two highly polarized options.

I'd absolutely understand if this is a ""the devil we know is better than the devil we don't"" situation. Do you see the risks of change as greater than the risks of stagnation? (I promise this isn't a judgement. We all view change differently. I'm genuinely curious because I'm trying to solve a problem without creating more problems.)",t2_32up2,gcnovus,0,1637688213.0,0,t1_hlsgmja,hlsgmja,False,gcnovus,t3_r0268i,https://www.reddit.com/r/napa/comments/r0268i/election_reform/,Election Reform,/r/napa/comments/r0268i/election_reform/hlsgmja/,4,r/napa,0,4
"My top reasons for supporting either Approval Voting (AV) or Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV/IRV):

1. **Geographic boundaries dilute the power of many interest groups** Groups such as new parents, bicyclists, shift workers, and people with hearing impairments have a harder time getting their issues addressed because they are spread across districts. Under AV/RCV, any sufficiently large group can have a direct impact, no matter the cause that brings them together.
2. **Elections under AV/RCV are kinder** Under first-past-the-post voting, the spoiler effect means politicians are incentivized to attack one another even if they are broadly aligned on issues. Under AC/RCV, they are incentivized to collaborate. Even where we disagree on policies, we all want Napa to thrive, and that requires working together.
3. **We no longer need to do redistricting for city council seats** Redistricting is expensive and divisive. (Though we would need to pay for the initial transition and education. In the long-term, I think AC/RCV is a win here, but it's likely not in the short-term.)",t2_32up2,gcnovus,0,1637687733.0,0,t1_hlsfdbf,hlsfdbf,True,gcnovus,t3_r0268i,https://www.reddit.com/r/napa/comments/r0268i/election_reform/,Election Reform,/r/napa/comments/r0268i/election_reform/hlsfdbf/,3,r/napa,0,3

Thank you so much for the time you took to share your experience - this is exactly the type of intel on the area that really helps. We live nearby in SF and visit Napa every few months, but have no way near this level of on-the-ground understanding.

Our wedding venue is all confirmed in Glen Ellen, so it's a little further away from the fires which have impacted the Calistoga area. Plus we're more looking to visit Calistoga *after* the wedding around July 4. Our plan is to drive up after and stay in one of the hot spring hotels on the main strip - We'll be relaxing there with a bunch of Australian guests who have never done a July 4 before, let alone visited California, so we think Calistoga being touristy will actually be perfect!!
