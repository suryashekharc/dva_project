">Corporan was taken to the Hudson County Correctional Facility and released following his first court appearance on Saturday, March 19. Johnson was released on a summons and is scheduled to make her first court appearance on Friday, April 1.

Johnson the Doctor isn't said to have sold anything was given a summons. Is the story accurate, yes, is this also a shitty thing to print if she had nothing to do with it and the summons was given so they can investigate further also yes.

The Stevens arrangement is not new to COVID; it has been going on for a long time because Stevens increased its enrollments over the last 10 years but did not have the dorm space on campus for all of its students. In theory this will end at some point soon because of the new dorms (the towers) that were constructed during COVID. For what it is worth.

"Really depends on the asset, quality of landlord etc. 

In most cases for CRE assets in our area potential tenants will submit proposals with the landlord and arrive at an LOI. Some people refer to this as exchanging LOIs etc so there could just be a language disconnect with you guys. 

That being said, we submit RFPs (request for proposal) to many landlords when there are more nuances to the project. Landlord will respond in kind with a proposal/ LOI till we arrive at an agreed upon set of terms. Both sign off on said terms and then draft a lease or just acknowledge by email and tell them to draft a lease based on said proposal. 

Lastly, I hope you’re using a CRE broker and not a realtor because those are two very different asset class focuses. Also, just a heads up, a “realtor” is not necessarily synonymous with the real estate search process. It’s is an accredited title of a residential real estate agent.

"Here’s 90% of it. It has way less nuance than football. 

- strategically it’s pretty much everyone runs a qb option non-stop (lateral pass or keep running w ball, bc of this you see a lot of zone coverage)
- no downs. Possession changes on penalty or loss of ball which happens during a…
- ruck:  happens upon tackle as immediately tackler and ball carrier can’t touch ball so each side tries pushing their side over the ball for possession. People formed in Ruck can’t Touch ball with hands, only feet. 
- no blocking. This has huge impacts on dynamic of game. 
- no forward passes, only kicking forward. You drop the ball forward it’s a change possession. 
- all positions play d and o. There’s a forwards (like linemen) and backs (secondary). 
- you don’t score until you literally touch the ball in the end zone. (It’s called a try / try zone) that determines where you kick from so you touch it close to center as possible.

"Highly recommend A Whole New World Academy on 8th & Washington. They have fantastic teachers, a fun filled day for the kids, and I haven’t seen any staff turn over. 

Something to look out for is making sure staff is not a revolving door. Ask about teacher turnover when touring. If staff is treated right & paid well, I find you will get the best care for your kids. We pay $2100 for 1 year old, our tuition gets cheaper as my kid grows up. I found A Whole New World to have better prices than Light Bridge & Cresthill uptown. Tuition was about $2600- $2800 last spring/ early summer. 

I also recommend joining Hoboken Mommies Facebook group. There is a Google Spreadsheet someone made with tuition prices and daycare amenities (such as own playground, meal plans, live camera). Those Hoboken mommies do not play around. You’ll be able to see what daycares are raved about & which daycare often questioned/ criticized. Take a look at the list to try to find a daycare closest to your home or on your commute. You don’t want to have to backtrack on your way into work.

Check hours of care and how the school handles food when the littles are older- major points for not having to prepare food during the week. When you’ve narrowed down your top contenders suggest asking a parent at each school for a sample daily report and how they communicate with teachers. Also ask how much teacher turnover has been.
