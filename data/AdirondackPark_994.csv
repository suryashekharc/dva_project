"Love this post.. so many thoughts and points

Partly because you do the ADKFunPolice the right way.  There, they would say the same thing in a snarky/arrogant way.

I think the same thing every time I go back to Deer Pond and there is a aluminum boat chained to a tree... and of course everything is wrong to someone else (when I go back to deer pond I ride my bike, some probably don't like that)

I have been back to Deer Pond about 10 times. I have never seen that boat on the lake.. so basically someone has littered the area AND said this is MY litter only.   


I think of this much the same way if someone would park their car and take up three spots at the supermarket   


And you touch on the broken window syndrome... first there is one broke window, but because of that, another window is broken

or -- first there is that boat, then someone puts their trash under the boat...

Every time I see a boat left somewhere, I wish I had bolt cutters and wish to hide the boat at the bottom of the lake..or send it across the lake.. or hide it in the woods.",t2_9hxt6du0,couchdog27,0,1648264382.0,0,t1_i25gcmh,i25gcmh,False,phishingstreams19,t3_tjbs6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/tjbs6t/stashed_boats/,Stashed boats.,/r/Adirondacks/comments/tjbs6t/stashed_boats/i25gcmh/,1,r/Adirondacks,0,1

Unpopular opinion: I preferred hiking from the AMR with the “pilot program.” The trails were more enjoyable without the overcrowding. There are other access points and alternate routes than parking in the AMR. I only found it difficult to get a reservation during the fall. The trails are some of the best maintained in the Adirondacks. The rich club members help provide money to the area. There are some positives to it.

there are reasons the AMR can restrict access listed in the document. whether or not they apply is matter of opinion. 

as for throttling / restricting access, it is worth remembering that the easement called for the AMR to provide only 20 parking spots. they provided more than that for years and as part of the permit system they expanded their lots to accommodate 70 vehicles. 

what really grates most folks is that this change came on the heels of parking crackdowns all through the region. if a permit system that came with expanded parking lots happened 10 years after parking was tightened i don't think most folks would mind as much.",t2_bqliq,973845585518,0,1648157659.0,0,t1_i1zgks9,i1zgks9,False,hartlarious,t3_tk1t43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/tk1t43/reservations_to_high_peaks_gateway_continue_may_1/,Reservations to High Peaks gateway continue May 1,/r/Adirondacks/comments/tk1t43/reservations_to_high_peaks_gateway_continue_may_1/i1zgks9/,1,r/Adirondacks,0,1

"hmm. i don't think bailout is quite the right word, but it might depend who you ask and when you asked them. 

3 things happened at that time:

1. the state bought a bunch of land from the AMR

2. the AMR got a conservation easement on the land

3. AMR and state agreed to a hiker easement

1 was a result of the state rapidly raising taxes and wanting to purchase peaks and land in the area. the AMR couldn't keep up with expenses so they sold.

2 is just an exchange of the land owner not developing the land in return for significant tax cuts. this is super common and happens on conserved land all over the country as it benefits both the land owner and the public.

for 3, per the legal language, the hiker easement is techncially a gift from the AMR tossed in. as i suggested in the other post, they had been allowing hikers for decades anyway, this just guaranteed that right. my personal opinion is that A. the state wasn't going to pay more for a hiker easement at the time, the costs of 1 and 2 were already too high and B. keeping it a 'gift' gave the AMR more control over the terms of the hiker easement.",t2_bqliq,973845585518,0,1648123194.0,0,t1_i1x4p9e,i1x4p9e,False,hartlarious,t3_tk1t43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/tk1t43/reservations_to_high_peaks_gateway_continue_may_1/,Reservations to High Peaks gateway continue May 1,/r/Adirondacks/comments/tk1t43/reservations_to_high_peaks_gateway_continue_may_1/i1x4p9e/,2,r/Adirondacks,0,2

1977 

ALBANY,  
 Sept. 5—New York State has agreed to buy 9,311 acres in the eastern   
Adirondack Mountains, including 11 of their highest peaks, to add to the  
 Adirondack Forest Preserve.When the   
land is formally transferred to public ownership, in perhaps four or   
five months, the state will own all of the 46 Adirondacks peaks that are  
 higher than 4,000 feet. The 46 are known collectively as the High Peaks  
 Wilderness Area. One of the most beautifully rugged areas in the   
country, the high peaks attract thousands of hikers and mountain   
climbers every year.The land is being sold by the Ausable Club, a summer vacation retreat for the well‐to‐do, for $744,800, or about $80 an acre.“It's  
 a sad day for the club.” said Williamam P. Dunham, Its president, who   
explained that rising taxes and cost of operation and substantial   
deficits had forced the sale.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe  
 club, which has 315 members, will retain 7,211 acres in a narrow strip   
along the east branch of the Ausable River, including two well‐known   
lakes, Upper Ausable and Lower Ausable Lakes, its huge, old and rustic   
clubhouse and 21 cottages.Both   
properties are just south of the hamlet of Keene Valley on Route 73,   
little to the west of Interstate 87 (the Adirondack Northway) and about   
20 miles east of Lake Placid.Money   
for the purchase will come from $44 million authorized for acquiring   
Adirondack properties contained within the 1972 Environmental Quality   
Bond Act, in which the voters authorized spending $1.5 billion for   
various conservation measures.The   
Ausable Clubproperty is the first major acquisition of land by the state  
 since Governor Carey froze money, which had been authorized by the   
referendum, during the state financial crisis in 1975.The  
 purchase focuses attention on continuing problem in the Adirondacksthe   
maintenance of the few remaining huge estates and rustic mansions that   
were the summer retreats of the wealthy when the property tax was much   
lower.Editors’ PicksVivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier’s Turbulent Relationship, Retold With CompassionDebra Messing Can Age 90 Years Easily. It’s Baking That’s Hard.Yes, You Can Make Your Tech Survive ObsolescenceContinue reading the main storyAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn  
 1975, the state bought Sagamore, a 1,500‐acre estate in the central   
Adirondacks that had been built by William West Durant in 1897. It was   
added to the “forever wild” section of the forest preserve. Its opulent   
buildings were bought by a nonprofit organization as a conference   
center.State Will Pay Property TaxAt  
 about the same time, the state was given another magnificent rustic   
estate, Camp Topridge, built by Marjorie Merriweather Post, the   
cereal‐fortune heiress, near Saranac Lake. Since then, the state has   
maintained the vacant buildings and the land at a cost of about $70,000   
year because it does not know what to do with them.Acting  
 for the Ausable Club in the latest transfer were Mr. Dunham, the club's  
 president; Morgan K. Smith, chairman of the board of the Adirondack   
Mountain Reserve Inc., the corporate name of the club, and its general   
counsel, Arthur V. Savage of New York and Elizabethtown. The state   
negotiators were Peter A. A. Berle, the Commissioner of Environmental   
Conservation, and his deputy, Dr. Theodore Hullar.“It  
 is a very positive step,” Mr. Berle said. “It brings into the public   
domain areas of the High Peaks that should be owned by the public.”Dr.  
 Hullar added that the state could now manage the high peaks area as one  
 unit without the threat of varied approaches to management practices.In  
 Keene Valley, according to The Lake Placid News, the only concern was a  
 possible loss of tax revenues. But both Mr. Berle and Mr. Dunham said   
that the state would continue to pay taxes on the newly‐acquired land.The  
 11 high peaks that will henceforth be owned by the state are Armstrong,  
 Basin, Blake, Colvin, Dial, Gothics, Haystack, Saddleback, Saw Teeth,   
Upper Wolf Jaws and Lower Wolf Jaws. In addition, a peak not quite so   
high, Noonmark Mountain, a 3,586‐foot‐high landmark just south of Keene   
Valley, is included.Up to now, the   
state has been the largest single taxpayer in the area, paying about   
$67,000 a year in county, town and school taxe",t2_5qi977o3,LeftBuffalowing,0,1648066779.0,0,t1_i1ub4g2,i1ub4g2,False,LeftBuffalowing,t3_tl3qo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/tl3qo9/amr_easement_history/,AMR easement history-,/r/Adirondacks/comments/tl3qo9/amr_easement_history/i1ub4g2/,9,r/Adirondacks,0,9

"Idk, personally I kinda like the reservations because I don't have to wake up at 4am and drive an hour or whatever to -maybe- get a parking spot, and as a bonus the trails aren't as crowded. 

Though I 100% agree with the screwing over the day-of hikers. I asked about that last year too because I sometimes decide day of, or late the night before. You should be able to call and reserve a spot same day, which would reduce empty spots due to cancellations / no shows and give hikers the flexibility to not have to know what they're doing by 5pm the day before. I hope that's something they eventually implement. 

I also think they should let you reserve parking spots AND trail spots. Like if the parking lot is full and everyone is hiking Indian Head, who cares if I get dropped off to hike Noonmark? If they really wanna make it look like a trail conservation thing, that'd be a smart move, because otherwise everyone's right, it does come off as restricting access to the property in general.",t2_2qb0hbsx,wh3r3nth3w0rld,1,1647965741.0,0,t1_i1oe1bx,i1oe1bx,False,hartlarious,t3_tk1t43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/tk1t43/reservations_to_high_peaks_gateway_continue_may_1/,Reservations to High Peaks gateway continue May 1,/r/Adirondacks/comments/tk1t43/reservations_to_high_peaks_gateway_continue_may_1/i1oe1bx/,5,r/Adirondacks,0,5

"Tom was a friend and coworker of mine.   Hiking is pretty much which connected us in the office (aside from the actual projects), and he had solid experience and I would often chat with him about my plans and get his feedback.  He was not a risk-taker in terms of personality or behavior, and I can't explain how stunned our office is at this outcome.

We were alerted to the situation when he missed his daily check-in.  However, there's currently no information that is available outside of the news article.  Depending on family wishes, I'll try to post a follow-up here if there's anything that can help future hikers.  We (friends/coworkers) currently don't know if it was hiking related (injury, exposure, etc), or even if it was as unpredictable as an aneurism or heart attack.

His experience level was high, but anything outside of what's in the article is unfortunately just speculation at this point.

Suspected avalanche.


More details on Tom's experience from his family:  Tom was an accomplished mountaineer and hiker. He spent over forty years climbing some of the most challenging mountains on the globe: ascending Mt. McKinley, Mt. Huascaran in Peru, and Xixabangma Peak in the Himalayas, to name but a few. He hiked the 273-mile Long Trail in Vermont and the entirety of the 2,000-mile long Appalachian Trail, from Maine to Georgia. In October 2021, he crossed the entire White Mountain Presidential Range in one day. Tom aspired to climb the second-highest mountain on each of the seven continents and had finished the first part of this journey when he scaled Mt. Kenya in the fall of 2021.",t2_b2o14,Aethermancer,0,1647885200.0,0,t1_i1k2tv3,i1k2tv3,True,NewAgePhilosophr,t3_thd6o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/thd6o4/rangers_in_the_adirondacks_recover_the_body_of/,Rangers in the Adirondacks recover the body of missing Connecticut hiker,/r/Adirondacks/comments/thd6o4/rangers_in_the_adirondacks_recover_the_body_of/i1k2tv3/,7,r/Adirondacks,0,7

"To be clear, the route is very hard on an absolute basis. My comment was only to suggest that my understanding is that the vertical ice portion is limited when it fills in. Anyone attempting it should be very educated in traveling through avalanche terrain. Within the realm of ice climbing (already hard), though, I suspect it’s on the easier end (of an already difficult and dangerous sport).

One does not “dabble” in ice climbing.

"Lake Placid is a long drive from Albany. It is beautiful, but there are closer spots that can give you a feel for the area and still are worth the look.

I'd suggest getting off 87 earlier, at exit 21 and go through Lake George. You can park and check out the lake view. Restaurants are mixed, but I would recommend Caffe vero for coffee, breakfast or lunch. I'm not sure what's open now, but the tourist info center has a lot of details and pamphlets. It is maple syrup season, some farms not far (20 minutes) from Lake George have tours and tasting. Toad Hill Maple is excellent.

From there you can follow the lake north to Bolton and enjoy the ride up there. It's a nice little town and Bolton Brewing is good. The Sagamore is a classic old hotel on a private island and beautiful to see  You can continue along Lake George to Hague and stop at pull off for the the view. From there, cut across route 8 by the Pharaoh Wilderness and Brant Lake and start heading back or go to Schroon Lake which has good food options and stores. This all gives you a sense of the vast wilderness and beauty of the lakes here. 

Alternatively, go across Route 28 to North Creek and see Gore mountain. I'm not sure if it's open but the old train depot is where Teddy Roosevelt found out he was president on his trip down from Mt Marcy and has a small museum. North Creek is nice and is a good spot to stop and stretch your legs by the Hudson.

"story: I was hiking with a group of middle school kids and a counselor... a couple adults and the counselor decided to go do an extra hike. When they were late returning I went to Johns Brook Lodge and informed the people there that they were late (that they were probably okay, but just for a heads up if they weren't back)  


they did a great job of not rolling their eyes. 

(in the end the counselor, who was in charge of he entire group, was mad at me for turning this in (More because he had gone on a little joy trip and left 80% of his group to fend for themselves)

Point being. People are missing or late all the time in the Adirondacks. Even if there wasn't a shortage of rangers.. they would eliminate their budget in six months if they went on a search and rescue every time they saw a car in the parking lot.

Don't mean to be cheeky

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"I have have only done the Trap Dike in the summer, but I actually think it might be somewhat easier in winter depending on the snow conditions. The videos I’ve seen of how it fills in suggest that the crux of the dike (before it opens to the slide) is more gradual than it is during the summer. I have a cousin who has done it in the winter (and loved it) but swears it’s crazy to do in the summer. So, for someone with full crampons, axes, and the experience to use both, I suspect it isn’t a terribly difficult climb. However, it is most definitely a climb, not a hike, and can’t be completed with snowshoes alone. 

If we assume he had that gear and experience (which is admittedly a big assumption) then I think the only mistake was going alone. Even there, it’s a matter of risk tolerance. Would I do it alone? Nope. But for someone who truly knows the risks, I wouldn’t want to stop them. Free soloing is crazy in my mind, but I wouldn’t want to outlaw it. 

Honestly, even if he had someone with him, it still could’ve happened. Above the Dike, on the slide, I doubt you can place much fixed protection. At that point, having a partner just means having someone on the other end when you fall, trying, potentially in vain, to arrest for TWO people. 

When I did the Trap Dike in the summer my buddy and I agreed on how to get help if something happened, knowing that it would likely involve a multi hour rescue and risk of death was real, even with someone to get help. That poor college kid fell to his death probably 10-12 years ago with a group. Even going with someone doesn’t eliminate the risk. 

Part of the allure of the outdoors is challenging yourself. One can only hope he had the knowledge to appropriate weigh the risks he took, and that he didn’t stumble into something way over his level of experience.",t2_b7yyt,yanksftw,0,1647641086.0,0,t1_i17jyy6,i17jyy6,False,NewAgePhilosophr,t3_thd6o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/thd6o4/rangers_in_the_adirondacks_recover_the_body_of/,Rangers in the Adirondacks recover the body of missing Connecticut hiker,/r/Adirondacks/comments/thd6o4/rangers_in_the_adirondacks_recover_the_body_of/i17jyy6/,27,r/Adirondacks,1,27

"To be fair I don’t think there is any offense intended here. The trap dike is a dangerous place and people get themselves in trouble in there all the time, even prepared hikers and even people with trained guides. There is inherent risk in any outdoor activity and everyone has their own risk tolerance. It’s well known that the trap dike is dangerous and choosing to hike it solo in winter invites some inherent risk. I don’t think it’s unfair to say doing so is flirting with disaster, but it also doesn’t mean that this man is responsible for what happened to him or deserved it or something like that.

"Got a reply from Andy! Unfortunately, no available legend but he answered a few questions:

Thanks for getting in touch. Unfortunately we don't have a legend for the outdoors map, although it's something I'd like to work on at some point. In the meantime I'm happy to answer any questions.

The ski routes are coloured based on their difficulty, as recorded in OpenStreetMap. So grey/black is advanced, red is intermediate, blue is easy and green is novice. Those reflect a colour scheme popular in Europe. The yellow pistes are unclassified, either because the difficulty isn't recorded in OpenStreetMap yet or because they are nordic or similar routes.

The different road types are shown in colour and width with the wider and more orange the bigger the road. Paths are also classified using their difficulty, with short red dashes for the most difficult paths and longer black dashes for easier paths.

If you have any other questions, please let me know!

You shouldn't hike in mud season, but not because of trail erosion!

Trail erosion is caused by water (which is, in turn, caused by poor trail design and maintenance); trail _widening_ is caused by feet, particularly where trails are poorly drained.

"There isn’t much to be honest. Always thought we could use a true sports bar downtown. 

Zig Zags is great, but definitely more of a pub - TVs limited but they do bring down the projector. No food really. 

Players is on the other end of Main Street. Not a huge fan there and the space is pretty tight. Never feels like a fun atmosphere but it’s OK. 

Pickled Pig actually I feel like has the best TV set up at their bar. Their BBQ is just OK, but as far as hanging at a bar and easily watching games, that would be my pick. 

Smoke signals is much better food, they have some TVs and a large projector, but the area around the bar is super tight and if you don’t have a seat at the bar which is limited, wouldn’t be a great option for watching the games. 

My favorite place for something like this is Grizle-Ts in Saranac Lake, but obviously is not in Lake Placid - great wings, TVs whatever you want and not that crowded.

"Yeah, April is probably the trickiest timeframe for hiking in the ADKs.  If there isn't tons of snow everywhere it will be mud season, like everyone else has stated.  

Another thing to consider that no one has yet mentioned is that with melting snow, streams may be swollen with meltwater.  What is normally a small stream that can easily be rock hopped across in the summer months very well may be a swollen, raging torrent that can be tricky if not dangerous to cross.  This can also be cyclical- warmer temps in the afternoon can mean that water is running highest late in the day.  Don't assume that just because you can safely cross a stream in the morning that you'll be able to safely re-cross that stream in the afternoon on your return hike back to the trailhead.  

If you can't postpone your trip to later in the season, I'd suggest looking at areas on the fringes of the park- Old Forge, Lake George, etc.  Much of the hiking in these areas is at lower elevations so you've got a better chance of more of the snow having melted by then.  The mud season considerations are still relevant but generally also less of a significant concern in these areas.",t2_4vujr,DSettahr,0,1647342678.0,0,t1_i0qhu7s,i0qhu7s,True,Rockajilly,t3_tedy3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/tedy3o/solo_trip_and_beginner_to_intermediate_hike/,Solo trip and beginner to intermediate hike recommendations?,/r/Adirondacks/comments/tedy3o/solo_trip_and_beginner_to_intermediate_hike/i0qhu7s/,4,r/Adirondacks,0,4

"No. Most of the land between the two ponds, and all the land surrounding Salmon, is private.

Even if it was publicly accessible, there’s over 300 feet of elevation gain going from South to Salmon, so this would certainly not be a navigable route. As a rule of thumb, if you see more than one contour line cross a stream on a topo map (maybe two contours if we’re talking a 10 mile distance), it will not be a flat water paddle. Also, if you can’t follow the route easily in a satellite photo (for example, if it disappears into the woods), chances are very good it’s not a flat water paddle. There are some exceptions, but they’re often a pain in the ass to paddle because when a stream flows through woods instead of a marsh, trees can easily fall across it (unless of course the route is popular enough that people cut out the blowdown).",t2_cag19,AGreatBandName,0,1647313566.0,0,t1_i0pct92,i0pct92,True,RS716,t3_te8kco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/te8kco/south_pond_to_salmon_pond/,South Pond to Salmon Pond,/r/Adirondacks/comments/te8kco/south_pond_to_salmon_pond/i0pct92/,2,r/Adirondacks,0,2

"Well, my home town for example, Ticonderoga, has one hotel, not nearly big enough to support the tourist industry during peak times. These towns whose primary revenue come from tourism, need a places for people to stay. Could zoning be implemented to ensure that neighborhoods still exist and along with how they’re taxed? Of course.  But I can tell you that the downtown ‘neighborhood’ in Ticonderoga doesn’t exist and could use some foot traffic.

I think your argument could also go for seasonal occupancy homes. I would also argue that a house owned by an out of stater and lived in two months out of the year brings less revenue than the BNB which attracts hundreds more throughout the year.  Keep in mind that this potentially is a much more accessible source of income for the local who live in a place where jobs are not as available or high-paying.

"Two months ago I lived in a cabin on someone’s property. I lived there over 4 years. Became good friends with the landlord. He decided to have a third kid. The house they lived in was behind me and definitely too small for 3 kids, so him and his wife bought a new place in the suburbs. Completely understandable, even helped him move. Hoped for nothing but the best for him. Fast forward a week later, 5 daddy’s boys in sperrys and boat shorts buy the property (as well as 5 others in town, it’s a small farm town). I meet them, tell them how long I’ve been there, explain I take care of the pool, know all the little details about the houses, offer services, you know, just be friendly. Try to make a good impression. They like me, tell me I have nothing to worry about. Two weeks later they finish renovating the place behind me and put it on air bnb. I’m a little irritated but hey it’s not my property and I’m being left alone. Or so I thought. A week later I get an eviction notice in the mail for 3 months from that point. Call the boat boy leader like what the fuck. Gives me the runaround, “oh we’re going in a different direction, we want to gut your place next”. I offer him increase in rent and tell him he would benefit more off of me than Airbnb, again it’s a small farm town that no one would visit unless it’s Christmas. Doesn’t listen, hangs up on me. My hands are tied, they’re doing everything the legal way. So let’s fast forward to now. I am now living in the city 40 minutes away, out of my element, both of my parents with major health issues 40 minutes away, feeling lost. Was able to move safely financially as I’ve landed an extremely good job the past 2 years. That income also gave me options that weren’t in the city and so far away from my parents, however most if not all the rental units in the surrounding areas, are AIR BNBS. To wrap this story up, fuck air bnb. Fuck rich people getting richer. It used to be 20 bucks to sleep on a couch before the wealthy found a way to capitalize on it and collect income without doing anything, once again. I was forced out of my home of almost 5 years so they could paint it white and rent it out for a hundred bucks a night.

"You all sound just like my husband and I!  We were living in NYC for 11 years - would come up to Saranac and Indian Lake to do all you mentioned. I'm late 30's he is early 40's.  When the pandemic hit we did what many did and bought upstate but there was no way we were going to the Catskills so we lucked out up here and got a cabin on a lake in Indian Lake.  We even got married on the property during the pandemic.

We wouldn't give it up for the world.  We still have ties to NYC and have to go back every once in a while but have been up here the last 2 years.  There is really no social life where we are but have met some lovely like minded people on our lake.  We didn't come up here to have a social life so it does depend on what you are looking for. 

We do miss the diversity (humans and food) but still we don't regret the move at all. North Creek has a cool vibe and some good food also.  We love Saranac like you mentioned and I'm sure there is a LOT more options there since they even have adorable coffee shops etc.

"I don't really think there is one *best* training experience. Those individual placements are great for exposure to public engagement/education and lots of different parts of conservation work, a ""master of none"" type of thing. Adirondacks Corps is great for getting lots of experience with trail construction. Assistant Forest Rangers do a lot of public engagement and learn more about the SAR side of things. American Conservation Experience has lots of conservation internships that focus on one specific area (botany for example) and I would argue that those are better training for actual management jobs with state/federal agencies. (I have no idea what SCA positions outside the park are like so I obviously can't speak to those).      
   
Conservation work is incredibly varied and, as such, there are seasonal positions that cater to different parts of it. Some are more general and some are hyper-focused.   
   
Regarding that position specifically, I guarantee you would be spending lots and lots of time just talking to hikers/campers about LNT, regulations, answering questions, etc. You wouldn't be getting training specifically regarding SAR-ops. You might get to go on a couple of training days with Rangers but won't walk away with any certifications to show on a resume. You may get to be on a few SAR calls, all depends on where you are when it comes in, if they need you, etc. It's a crap shoot. Again, talking to and educating the public is super, super important but it's a very different position from a trail crew.   
   
I agree there are definitely opportunities for conservation training in the Adirondacks, but I think we need more established pro crew opportunities.

Isn't the best training experience? Especially in jobs in the conservation field? I came across [this position](https://www.thesca.org/serve/position/natural-resource-steward-whitney-wilderness/po-00732663) when considering a 2nd term which covers natural resource management and SAR-ops. Obviously I don't know how involved the position is since I didn't apply but my previous position was 10 months and I was offered a wilderness first aid course and the opportunity to work under a regional biologist. Positions in the SCA/AmeriCorps vary greatly but I just feel as though there are opportunities for training in conservation in the ADKs if people look into it. I haven't even mentioned BOCES/AEC.,t2_7btgc,Zureka,0,1646978880.0,0,t1_i07k411,i07k411,False,adkcouncil,t3_taz07u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/taz07u/editorial_dont_let_moriah_shock_campus_rot/,Editorial: Don’t let Moriah Shock Campus rot,/r/Adirondacks/comments/taz07u/editorial_dont_let_moriah_shock_campus_rot/i07k411/,4,r/Adirondacks,0,4
"Eh, yes and no.   
Trained in natural resource management? Not really. They get exposure to the jobs/responsibilities of foresters/biologists but there isn't really any training to help them get hired for these positions.   
Trained in SAR-ops? Definitely no. Rangers will typically welcome help from the SCA on those operations but there is no formal training given for SAR/wilderness medicine. Assistant Forest Rangers typically fill the need for seasonal SAR-ops help.   
Trained in trail construction? The level of training depends. Adirondacks Corps will get certs and be heavily involved in the construction of new trails. Individual placements are doing more of brushing out established trails but will definitely get involved on a handful on new trail construction projects during the season.   
I think the SCA/AmeriCorps serve a valuable role in the Adirondacks and what they do is great but they differ greatly from other organizations.   
   
I think the author is envisioning something more similar to the California Conservation Corps. Members of the CCC join up for a full year (versus 3-4.5 months for SCA), get paid minimum wage + benefits, and there are established pathways to state/federal certifications (chainsaw training, red card, etc). I also think there would also be a lot to be said for a state run program.   
   
Also, the park is massive. The more trail crews the better.",t2_b1lo8,Ginn4364,0,1646977591.0,0,t1_i07i3r7,i07i3r7,False,adkcouncil,t3_taz07u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adirondacks/comments/taz07u/editorial_dont_let_moriah_shock_campus_rot/,Editorial: Don’t let Moriah Shock Campus rot,/r/Adirondacks/comments/taz07u/editorial_dont_let_moriah_shock_campus_rot/i07i3r7/,2,r/Adirondacks,0,2
"I live near Lake George which is very busy in the summer with a night life and there is transportation available to near by Queensbury/Glens Falls. Workers are in high demand and this year the demand may be even higher or lower due to the WAR. Many students come from  Ukraine to work and learn English but that does not look like they will be coming. Most of them work LONG HOURS, 60 or more. Currently there is a labor shortage but who knows what is going to happen with prices rising due to inflation and the WAR. Working as a server could make you some good money but many people are feeling the pain of higher prices. So the question is Will the summer season be busy and will the tips be as good??????? I have known students who have made 1,000 dollars per week during July and part of August. Many USA students go back to college in the 3 rd week of August which results in someone like yourself picking up more hours but business starts to drop off.  I think the Lake George Chamber of Commerce runs a program to bring foreign workers here and some buinesses offer housing.

Lake George, resort areas rely on foreign workers for summer

You do not want to go to Indian Lake to meet people your own age. Its too small a town for what you want. Others have commented on it. I am not sure about Old Forge but I do know that HOUSING is hard to get. Lake Placid is nice but again HOUSING is hard to get and expensive. Again contact their chamber of commerce in those area. Know the living arrangements before arriving.

Bolton Landing is just north of Lake George but smaller and they also look for foreign workers. There is some night life.  At this time I an not sure if there is transportation from Lake George to Bolton Landing.

LOOK at LAKE GEORGE for work. There are many things to do in this area. There is hiking, biking, swimming, lots of young people with a nice nightlife, a big ammusement park with all kinds of rides just 5 miles away and there is Saratoga Springs NY is just 40 miles away with horse racing and a great nightlife also but remember you may be working more than 40 hours.

Saratoga Srings NY (a small city) also has summer employment.

"On a serious note you should learn how to handle your car in winter. And I highly suggest studded snow tires next year. Best thing I ever did to improve my winter driving was insist on getting studs (as someone who grew up here, I've only ever had 4wd/awd or rwd cars and trucks. Fwd is crap in snow). Once you have a good vehicle and good tires on it, get out and drive during storms (start off with driving to a big parking lot and going around there or driving a short loop around where you live, just like when you first learned to drive, then make the trips longer), when you drive in the worst of it, it raises your confidence in less crappy weather, the more experience you have driving in winter the easier it gets.

"Mt. Van Hoevenberg has incredible views for an easy (comparatively, haha) hike. The new-ish trail from the Olympic Sport Complex is nice! The first half mile or so feels a little weird as you work your way out of the ski center area and up the mountain, but after that it's great. I was absolutely delighted with the views! Under 5 miles, and and around 800 feet of ascent, so very reasonable. :) 

&#x200B;

For a little bit tougher hikes (but still not 46-er intense) try Haystack Mountain and St. Regis Mountain. They are both part of the Saranac 6, and are just really pleasant mountains that offer nice time in the woods prior to summiting. (Don't get confused with Mt. Haystack, which is a whole 'nother beast located in the Great Range which I have certainly not yet attempted, haha!).

Except…& this is the local part I can’t speak to…everything by us shuts down. So you have to travel a little further to eat out & shop. The first year for me was touuuuugh. There’s no street lights so darkness descends and I don’t go out at all, not even to walk a dog. I kind of wish we loved in Keene/LK/Saranac where life is more normal year round. Also the small groceries really cut back in winter. I do travel to Saratoga and even Albany. So being within reach of Utica may help. We are active outside almost all year though and healthier than ever! We sit out black fly season. I love love love it here. Hope you can make the transition!!

"My fishing adventures haven’t featured strange sightings or sounds, just random falling trees. About 6 years ago I was fishing a small pond in the central adk. It was middle of August and it had just rained the night before but the early morning I went was pea soup fog and no wind. Before hiking into the pond, even before getting out of the truck I had a weird feeling of dread and being watched but I decided to suck it up and fish for a couple hours. An hour into it I crossed from one shore to the other and was changing flies when I heard the snapping of wood. A sizable yellow birch (~80 ft) came crashing down the bank and landed 1/2 in the water right where I was only minutes earlier. I sat in silence staring up at the stump, expecting a Bigfoot or a bear to be there laughing at me but there was just silence. I got out of there and never returned. Later that fall I was fishing a small pond in the southern adk on a calm day and a large white pine along the ponds outlet came crashing down. A couple years ago I was mountain biking around Nicks lake in old forge on a breezy day when I narrowly avoided getting squashed when another yellow birch broke its top which landed a few feet behind me as I pedaled away. This spring I was back fishing a brook trout pond when a large dead maple came splashing down into the pond about 50 yards from me. Perhaps the scariest time was camping in the 1995 microburst and having a 12 diameter tree branch land 6 ft from my head.

If you don’t know anyone who does it, it’s unusual to just one day show up and say “I’m going to try skiing”. As for lift ticket prices, yes they’re high, but not to scare away non-whites.

"The author seems to very much internalize race into her experience. I certainly agree that POC are pretty under represented in snow sports, and I'm sure there's a number of reasons from cost to just lack of exposure to the sports. But for what its worth, 

 - falling under the lift and getting heckled is a right of passage for *everybody* learning to ski and ride. 

 - Conditions this past week sucked, I've been boarding for 20+ years, was an AASI certified instructor for several years. I busted my ass HARD on Thursday after losing an edge on some ice. Shit happens.  

 - Cutting lift lines: An unfortunate side affect of visiting on a busy holiday week. 

Skiing and boarding have unfortunately always been expensive and that will always limit who has access to it. BUT I certainly am not happy with the rising cost either.

"In the Adirondacks things are different then out west. Dirt roads just simply wash out if used with off-road vehicles without a lot of maintenance. When they wash out, nothing can get through. You can drive a tracked jeep and still be unable to pass. An off road ATV with a winch will be unrecoverable. 

That's why it's illegal in the Adirondacks to drive a vehicle up trails. You will end up abandoning it because there's no other choice. I've seen vehicles abandoned 100 years ago that are still there. I've also seen vehicles abandoned 5 years ago that sat for months before the roads recovered enough for retrieval. 

If you've watched Matt's off road recovery, it's like operation golden nugget but a bit worse. On the good paths. 

And a 4x4 truck is about the minimum to get through the snow on the roads at times. So they're very common up there.
