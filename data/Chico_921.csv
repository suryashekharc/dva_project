"How do you think it is supposed to improve? The process of renting an apartment involves application fees, credit checks and usually a co-signer. If you make it over those hurdles you can pay $1300 for a 2 bd 1 bath apartment as long as you have the first month's rent and a deposit and want to sign a year lease. Also, some property management places will make you renew your lease in October even though you signed/moved in in July so if your life changes in April (like when a pandemic cancelled school) too bad, you already committed to another year way before your original lease ended.

"Yeah, that's a hard one. I have found the best way to go is Amtrak. The thing about Amtrak is that the train only heads south from Chico at 4 AM and north from Sac at midnight. The good news is that their bus service is pretty frequent, maybe 5 times a day. The catch is though that to get a bus ticket you have to also buy a train ticket. It's only $11 per way for either the train or the bus. Sometimes when I need to, I just buy two separate trips, forfeiting the cost of two train rides, totaling $44 overall. That is still about the same price as a round trip for greyhound which is both lower quality and a bit sketchy at times. Amtrak has been a great experience for me so far. Their buses have a pair of tables in the back of the bus and charging outlets. 

&#x200B;

The only issue with either of these bus services is that it's about another $20-$30 uber to get from their terminals to the airport......",t2_ysgvf,SEA___BEAR,0,1647455422.0,0,t1_i0wznl3,i0wznl3,True,itsalwayssunny10,t3_tfoebk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/tfoebk/travel_to_sacramento/,Travel to Sacramento,/r/ChicoCA/comments/tfoebk/travel_to_sacramento/i0wznl3/,16,r/ChicoCA,0,16

"That's correct in that there is no law making public nudity illegal. However if you're in plain view of others the cops can enforce various laws like indecent exposure on a complaint basis. This was all told to me by a park ranger while skinny dipping in the park. So the rules are very much based on the judgment of the law enforcement as to whether you're in plain view. Some where secluded with no other people is technically fine. But what the other commenter said is also correct in that you need to keep an eye out for any people especially kids approaching. People get real mad about nudity around kids.

"Here is some information/thoughts you didn't ask for, and I apologize ahead of time if some of it isn't your jam or jelly.

  
I agree with another commenter wrote about maybe looking into Durham. It's a 15 - 20 minute drive depending on where in town you live to Chico State, small town, has access to the highway, no complaints about it whatsoever besides being a little Podunk. 

You might also might want to consider Paradise as an option, especially (I hate saying this) if you're looking to buy instead of rent. This is strictly speculation as I haven't looked into the housing/renting market there since before the fire, but I'm assuming--someone correct me if I'm wrong--homes and lots are a buyer's market due to the Camp Fire. Though it could also be the inverse. Still! Something you might want to look into, Paradise is also 20ish minutes to Chico depending on where in Paradise. And it's elevated with lots of pine and trees and if you go high enough during Winter you get snow, which you don't in Chico. I mean... Paradise is still rebuilding itself as well and I don't know what the community is like, so keep that in mind if you do give it a looksie. 

It wasn't asked, but Chico has a ton of culture. I grew up in Fresno which has lots of drugs, gangs, violence and hard-liner, far-Right conservatives. But there's this little bitty area called the Tower District that's a bastion of culture: My favorite coffee shop was next door to a bar on one side, an Italian delicatessen on the other. Across the street from the coffee house was a tea shop, and next to that was an old school record store, next to that Asian-Fusion restaurant, down the road was a table-top gaming shop, and even further down the Tower Theater. I mention all that because Chico feels like the Tower District but more spread out, less condensed. There's local artists and musicians  and theaters (4-5 off the top of my head) and burlesque troupes. The regional manager of the Taco Bell I worked at gave my co-worker two weeks off to tour California with his band. That's what sells it for me, it's beautifully cultured. 

This is more of a side thing since no one else mentioned it--and forget it if it's not your thing! There isn't a huge kink community here, but the one we do have is incredibly friendly and welcoming. Wonderful and wonderfully open-minded people if you know how to look for them.

Drugs is a thing here, but it's more party drugs for college students. I mentioned Oroville having meth? We have weed and mushrooms (some cocaine? Not my thing), and it's not in as much quantity as Oroville (or Fresno, geez).

Fun fact, Kyle Gas did a show here with his band Trainwreck and he signed my new leather jacket. With a silver sharpie. By drawing a big doodle of his face. And the leader singer of the band talked mad smack on Fresno, I'm a big fan.

There's a dog park north of town (also more ritzy, very nice neighborhood(s)), so if you have puppers or plan to have some, there's an easy place to socialize them and take them for a treat :)

For almost half the year we have what we call Thursday Night Farmer's Market, which is separate from the really nice Farmer's Market we have Saturday mornings year round. A large area of downtown is sectioned off near the plaza for local businesses, organizations, food trucks (omg the food trucks), artists, craftspersons, gardners and farmers to sell and show their wares/organization's things. There've been plant sellers, jewelers, speed painters, impromptu shows, planned musical performers, and there's always spots reserved along the ""causeways"" for musicians to sing and play and jam out. Thursday Night Market is one of the best things about this place. Here's an old link about last year's Market: [https://www.downtownchico.com/event-thursday-night-market\_16.htm](https://www.downtownchico.com/event-thursday-night-market_16.htm)

I'll end it by disclaiming that while I've traveled across the country and then some, I've only ever lived in California (besides a few months-long stints in NY and out of country), and then only ever in Fresno and Chico. 

So my Tl;dr is, Chico is a fine town with a lot of flaws and I think you'll be happy here, family and all. 

I'm very open to anyone correcting me if I got any of my information wrong. It's late and I'm bushed.",t2_3d3gw7px,MattDickInABox,0,1646483884.0,0,t1_hzg1wvk,hzg1wvk,False,dlugosac,t3_su2d12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/su2d12/seeking_recent_advice_on_chico_as_new_home/,Seeking recent advice on Chico as new home.,/r/ChicoCA/comments/su2d12/seeking_recent_advice_on_chico_as_new_home/hzg1wvk/,3,r/ChicoCA,0,3
"Hi there! I've been in Chico for about 10 years cumulatively. Came here for college, never really left. In fact the whole family moved up here, and we've been pretty happy ever since. I do want to move eventually, but that's partly because I feel like I'm still very young (your age) and haven't seen enough of the world to know where to plant roots. This place became my second hometown, and I personally feel like I need to leave my hometown eventually.  
  
That said, it ain't perfect. A lot of people have had problems I've somehow avoided, like those that have been posted here, and I've heard enough from friends to second-hand corroborate the stories. I'll try to answer your questions, then throw in miscellaneous input.  
  
*1. How is Chico for raising a family (schools, community)?*  
For a couple years I helped raise my niece while her parents lived with us, she was somewhere in 1st - 3rd grade at the time. I know that she loved her school and friends, and especially her teacher. I've only heard good things about the teaching community and non-college schools in town, and I can only speak for our little apartment complex, she got along phenomenally with the neighbor kids. The community as a whole is a good one. Like someone else wrote, it's a lot more politically Left than the rest of the county, which for me is a positive. What's more of a positive though is that I've found more people who are Right-wing that are open to friendly discussion and debate than anywhere else I've been, and I've a few friends who vote that way (generally). People of either side of the aisle who can speak their differences and even change each others' minds is a very good sign to me. Oh, also! If you're the \[Christian\] religious sort, I've been to a couple churches and I've enjoyed my Sundays there. Somewhat related, if you're part or supportive of the LGBT community, Chico is generally very welcoming. Very strong Stonewall presence. Churches made me think of it because Lutheran First here in Chico is very LGBT+ friendly.  
  
*2. Is Chico’s crime/homeless situation improving?*  
Yes and no? Maybe? The last time I checked bike theft was the number one crime here, but I've heard plenty of stories of auto break-ins (not many of home burglaries). Had one happen to myself, but I was the dingus who left the door unlocked on a side street around the corner from any housing. The homeless situation *is* worsening. I haven't heard a story about homeless development that wasn't negative, whether it's increased homelessness or the city doing something real shitty as policy to them. As an example, the city shut the only recycling center in town that paid CRV for cans, bottles, other recyclables. This hurts personally because I have a family member who makes a full-time job of collecting recyclables to pay rent for his apartment and this development made it so much harder for him to keep a stable income to pay legitimate bills. I think it was meant to incentivize the homeless to leave for somewhere else, but the result is grifters are buying cans at half value or charging (in my guy's case) very high prices to take them to the nearest recycling centers (Oroville, maybe Orland?). Sorry, that was a tangent. Gets my goat. Chico PD is a mixed bag, some are good, some are great, some are crap. On St. Patrick's Day (much celebrated holiday) in 2017, a police officer tased, shot, and killed an unarmed black man named Desmond Phillips during a mental health episode. Links from the local reputable newspaper, Chico News and Review (CN&R), are linked below. Oroville PD, weirdly for all the jokes we make about the town being more methed out than ours, I've only heard outstandingly good things. California Highway Patrol gave me a ride home once when I was caught illegally biking from Oroville to Chico (bought the bike in Oro, busses stopped running, no car, much younger) instead of giving me a ticket or arresting me. Major point in their favor, but I'm biased.  
https://www.newsreview.com/chico/content/looking-for-answers/23948201/  
https://www.newsreview.com/chico/content/phillips-case-closed/28511926/  
  
*3. What neighborhoods should I check out as potential places to live?*  
What we call the Aves has a bad reputation from 10 - 20 years ago when violent crime was much higher. The fact is I've spent most of my time in Chico living in that area and haven't ever had a problem. It's on the other side of Chico State from downtown (avoid living downtown for family life), but the further you get from campus the less you'll be bothered by parties and such. Otherwise rent has been relatively cheap, there are some *really* nice houses if you can find one for rent/sale. Best place I've ever lived (not with family) was in the Aves. Overall a cautious thumbs up.  
The ritzier parts of town are definitely southeast near the 20th Street and Skyway freeway exits. There's more urban development/city expansion happening in that area both residential and commercial, not to mention some remote suburbs. Were I affluent enough (and couldn't find a really nice old house off the edges of downtown (for myself, not a fan for families)), somewhere between 20th and Skyway is where I'd want to live.  
Really the only places I'd tell you to avoid living in is the immediate Downtown Chico area due to great amounts of college students and homeless-- there is a very active nightlife, especially when school is in session (sidenote: town gets pretty quiet during college vacations).

"Adecco (temp agency) has been really good to me and I highly recommend them. Gotten a handful of jobs from them, and one ***really*** sweet gig. It was supposed to be a temp job, but it lasted for 8 months instead of 1, and I would have been hired on in a full-time managerial position if the work location they assigned me to didn't close down. This is *probably* the exception, but it was possible through Adecco.

*However*, if you're open to working for DoorDash or GrubHub, GrubHub's wait list is very short whereas DoorDash's waitlist is huge.

***However,*** if you select your starting market in DoorDash to be in a different zip than Chico, you might be able to start up right away. Starting market does not mean you have to deliver there, DoorDash lets you deliver in any area you're geographically in. ***If*** the zip code you select as your starting market has a waitlist, you can reach out to DoorDash driver support (Driver Care) on the app, text chat with a support worker, and request your starting market be somewhere without a waitlist.

"From the article:

""SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California’s governor proposed a plan Thursday to offer more services to homeless people with severe mental health and addiction disorders even if that means compelling some into care, a move that many advocates of homeless people oppose as a violation of civil rights.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a press conference that he has no intention of rounding people up and locking them away. Instead, he said his plan would offer a way for people to get court-ordered psychiatric treatment, medication and housing, preferably before they are arrested.

Under the plan, which requires approval by the Legislature, all counties would have to set up a mental health branch in civil court and provide comprehensive and community-based treatment to those suffering from debilitating psychosis. People need not be homeless to be evaluated by a court.

But if approved, they would be obligated to accept the care or risk criminal charges, if those are pending, and if not, they would be subject to being held in psychiatric programs involuntarily or lengthier conservatorships in which the court appoints a person to make health decisions for someone who cannot""",t2_kflwb,Tavli,0,1646349664.0,0,t1_hz8x1ou,hz8x1ou,True,Tavli,t3_t64gyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/t64gyn/gov_newsom_proposes_new_plan_to_force_some/,Gov.

"But, yea, no - you don't want to do that counsel thing right now...it's a fucking shitshow, no it's the American Horror Shitshow. Also, the whole recycling center drama is kinda shitty as well. There used to be one on 20th St, but it had been spluging gross chemicals all over the neighborhood for decades and it was not great. I wish they relocated in a responsible manner somewhere out by the airport where it's already an environmental mess from being a military base during WWII. 

There **IS** money, it's just not placed very well throughout the city projects and the planners, and counsel, and basically everyone in charge are a bunch of cronies. They did provide a potty and a wash station for a few months at the beginning of the pandemic, it was in the parking lot where the farmers market occurs, but apparently it was too much effort so they took it out. 

The people here have this ""Small Town"" mentality that they are obsessed with - it's kinda crazy. We're a town of over 100,000 people, which really makes us a *midsized* city. Around 15K of those people are from the Camp Fire, and around a forth or fifth of those people had nowhere else to go so they ended up homeless in shelters, Rvs and tents.

"> As far as keeping it dry, it's not any harder than PLA.

I don't try to keep PLA dry though...its literally in my closet.

With PETG if I don't dry it in the oven I get bad quality prints. But once its dry its good for like a day or so before flaws start creeping in.

Actually printing PETG is easy...much better than ABS IMO.

"As far as keeping it dry, it's not any harder than PLA. I literally don't do anything different than I did before swapping. PETG has some properties that I like a bit better. It has a slightly higher glass transition point, it handles weathering better, and tends to be a bit stronger than PLA.

I sometimes need PETG instead of PLA. The price different between PETG and PLA is basically non-existent. Once dialed in, PETG isn't actually any harder to print than PLA, and going back and forth is a pain. The only thing I really miss about PLA is the extra color choices that seem to be available and the faster print times.

"To the original poster I've been here a year n that park has been off n on closed n idk for sure but have seemed to be tied to their annual events they do there... Like this winter season there was the ice rink there. IDR what it was but thought I saw something going on there in spring/summer too so maybe prep for next 'event'.  


There's a lot to unravel, I too am from so cal n mindblown over the volume of homeless here in chico even compared to LA/San Diego. I'm a doordasher so was complaining to another driver about my run ins with the homeless breaking into my car n how I can't wrap my head around how all these people ended up homeless in the middle of no where (no offense native chico peeps, its a cute town for being in bum fuk egypt). Like if I were homless here, I'd collect enough to catch a bus till I hit a beach... But the other driver explained to me a large number of them are from the paradise fire. Un-Insured homeowners n whatnot... All of these public services cost money... dumpsters/bathrooms/etc all cost a lot... especially bathrooms in the middle of a pandemic... hazmat is no joke... Lookin at the roads n such on the west side of town I'm guessing budgets are tight as is.  


When I first moved here I was collecting cans n plastic bottles to recycle n could NOT find anywhere to take/deposit them... Then read somewhere that Chico shut them all down to detour the homeless to go elsewhere... A) Brutal and B) Like anything when you make something illegal/un-accessible it don't detour the problem it in turn creates a black market, so even today we still have homeless digging through our trash for recyclables... Why, if they can't recycle here in town? Well the handful of homeless that are living our car instead of a tent collecting them up for groups n making runs.

"Can anyone explain why Chicoans think the homeless issue is an assault on them? I mean, I've lived in Santa Ana, East L.A., Long Beach, Santa Cruz and North Vegas - let me tell you -  HOMELESSNESS IS A STATEWIDE/COUNTRYWIDE CRISIS!! It's not the poor attacking a small town located in the rural countryside outside Sacramento, Chico isn't that special. We don't really offer services the way the Nimbys think we do, I know that because I have seen what real services are and Chico does not have them. 

This - is drugs, mental illness, and poverty complicated by a broken system and fascist politics.  Even if these people had sobriety, lucidity, and employment - where would they live? There is no low-cost housing, and the requirements are hard to meet even for someone with full-time employment. 

The pallet houses are a great idea - but any notion that having the shelter will invite more people to our region is crazy. People might be coming down out of the Sierra, but they are certainly not getting 'bused' in or invited, that's insane and a complete fabrication.

Do I like trash everywhere? No! Do I think there is a fix? Um, how about some dumpsters in the park and near encampments? 

Do I like poop? Um, NO! Do I think there is a fix? Porta-Johns - it's not complicated.

"Hi. Teacher over here 🙋🏻‍♀️ I can tell you based on my experience the last two years, these masks are not that big of a deal for a few reasons:

A. Kids are not wearing them at lunch or recesses or PE or at any other time they are outside unless they choose. Neither are the adults working with them. They’re getting loads of facial cues. 

B. Kids step outside if they need a mask break with no problem, most kids don’t, but they could with no loss of instruction or judgement. 

C. The shear increase in positive moral from virtual to in person the last year and a half for us speaks volumes to students willingness to mask up without complaint. 

D. Believe me you, in the classroom masks still aren’t on 100% of the kids 100% of the time. That’s impossible. I remind students more than I’d like to check their masks. They fall when they talk, they forget when they comeback from the bathroom etc. 

E. Teachers don’t want to wear masks either. And we get a lot of crap if we wear them and if we don’t. No one just thanks us for showing up. Now we have protesters outside our schools? Parents putting kids in the middle. To me, someone who studied child psychology, that’s more detrimental to a child’s development. It sends mixed signals and creates emotional turmoil in younger students. We spend more time with your kids than you do. We teach, coach, mentor. We’re there for the ones who are living out of their car and giving them clean clothes and extra food, without being told to do so and not for any glory, just because we understand the more positive experiences kids get with people who care for them, the more resilience it builds. What happens? Termination threats for not getting vaccinated AND termination threats for enforcing children to wear masks. Termination threats for not enforcing mandates and now parents and school board members telling students to protest and not mask up? Who does that responsibility fall to? Teachers. We’ll be the ones to take the fall no matter the scenario. It’s a really old tactic. We’ve done it before, and we’ll do it again because at the end of the day all we really care about is taking care of the children. 

I personally don’t think this is a sustainable approach and we already failed in the face of this pandemic. I mask in class everyday. I got vaccinated. I was terrified of infecting my two year old. But we all got Covid by September because my student’s mom got it, gave it to him and he gave it to me. Probably because keeping kids masked is hard. We experienced very minor symptoms at first. My husband is still struggling to get back to normal. But the fear is gone now. I think most of our own compelling reasons for our opinions start with fear. Fear for hurting our children no matter if it’s because of a mask or no mask. In any case, emotionally driven responses can block our ability to reason and see logic. I just wish the dialogue about our future wasn’t politically driven or based on fear. It’s exhausting. But you bet I’ll be in the front of my class no matter what, because I love showing up for your kids.",t2_78j5eyxd,Snoo_52320,0,1645948265.0,0,t1_hymcdmv,hymcdmv,False,treelineghost,t3_sv0aqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/sv0aqd/the_idiots_are_alive_and_well/,The idiots are alive and well,/r/ChicoCA/comments/sv0aqd/the_idiots_are_alive_and_well/hymcdmv/,1,r/ChicoCA,0,1

"Lower Bidwell Park would be a fun paved bike ride to take your friends on. Upper park is a great local spot for hiking.


Hatchet House is a good time, and they do serve drinks.


Places like Secret Trail and other spots often have live music on the weekends. I'd check their website or IG to see what they've got going on.


As for general suggestions with food and drink spots, there's no shortage of solid options in town. Really depends on what kind of food you're looking for and the vibe that you're after. My personal favorite is Sierra Nevada - great food, awesome beer and a lively, welcoming atmosphere.

"> 2,000 over 2 years across all of America is quite low. Wouldn't you agree? 

It is alarming if you consider the age group, who has a very low death rate in a first-world country. Those numbers make it among the [top 10 causes of death for the age group](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsr1804754), despite being less susceptible to complications than older demographics.

> And does the vaccine not protect teachers and staff who are mandated to take it?

Absolutely, vaccines are associate with reduced severity of the disease. They are not bullet-proof, though.

> What use is the mandates if it does not offer protection?

Protection isn't binary, it isn't an all-or-nothing. Vaccines offer protection and so do masks. Vaccines make a big difference, but masks also help significantly reduce transmission... especially when people are trapped in the same room for prolonged periods of time, like in school.

Unless we could teach outside, there's no escaping the risks involved in being in the same room for hours at a time *without* limiting the circulation of the droplets and aerosols projected from talking/coughing/sneezing/etc. Masks significantly mitigate that risk. And those measures especially help the teachers and students with co-morbidities, which include older age, asthma, diabetes, cancer, and a number of other common ailments.",t2_tze9f,DrKevinBuffardi,0,1645255370.0,0,t1_hxjwxax,hxjwxax,False,treelineghost,t3_sv0aqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/sv0aqd/the_idiots_are_alive_and_well/,The idiots are alive and well,/r/ChicoCA/comments/sv0aqd/the_idiots_are_alive_and_well/hxjwxax/,2,r/ChicoCA,0,2

"I was born here, grew up 30 mins away, and have been living in Chico for about 5 years now. My boyfriend is finishing his degree at Chico State currently. My Dad worked at Chico State for 15 years lol and just transferred to SDSU. 

Pros: 

•Many good places for food, and a lot of diversity at that. About any type of cuisine is available, and also more affordable locations

•Based on your interests, there are a lot of good areas to cycle, hike, and bike! It's also a central location so 1-2 hours from skiing/snowboarding and about 4 hours if you want to see the ocean. 

•Great focus on local groceries. The Farmers Market is great, and since the area has a lot of agriculture there are nearby towns that have local goods as well (I'm from Corning, huge olive production and you can go to shops and get many different local olives) 

•The bar scene lives up to its reputation, and there's also quite a few nicer ones for those wanting a classier evening. 

•Almost forgot, Sierra Nevada! 

•Many antique shops, secondhand furniture is fairly easy to come by (thrift shops here always have something) but really not any affordable quality home goods stores. I wish we had an Ikea 😂

Cons: 

•I've had my car broken into once (I did leave something valuable in there so I take some responsibility) but it was in a Cal Park complex, and at the time I lived off E 1st Ave (like the busiest street in Chico). We live in the Barber neighborhood now, and we've had a couple of things stolen (a tarp, a little grill), but we had left them next to our fence in the front yard. They were behind a picnic table we have. There's been a couple of times a homeless person has been sitting at the picnic table which is weird, but for living here a little over 2 years, incidents haven't been bad. Also the homeless going through the trash thing is real, but we just try to ask them to stop nicely and we haven't had a repeat offender. So this is a Pro/Con? I think the nicer areas are targeted by crime, (I see a lot of package theft on Nextdoor, never had a package stolen personally)

•Next con is a big one, and the reason my boyfriend and I don't want to stay here...Housing. We rent, and the property managements have a hold on like everything. It seems there's a trend where they try to take advantage of the college age population, and they've gotten away with it for so long, it their MO. We would like to buy a house one day, and I know everywhere is expensive at the moment. What is the most frustrating to me is the value. I think Chico is very expensive right now for what it is. There aren't enough pros for us about the area to stay. 

•We're both on our way to finding careers and I feel there's not a lot of opportunities for either of us based on our interests. I would like to work in the arts somewhere, and there's not a lot of entry level options. He's in business and doesn't really want to do ag business so...yeah 😂 

•Don't know how it will be in 20ish years, but if your future children play sports expect high school politics. Also, high school sports are big here and there's that ""whole town goes the Almond Bowl"" thing. 

•There are many different clubs, events, businesses to pursue and learn *interests* (arts, athletics, STEM.) but not a lot of careers to work in those unless you want to be an entrepreneur lol. (thinking about the children thing lol and my experience from ages 18-23) 

To wrap up: The areas I view as most favorable to live in would be off Esplanade in the East Aves, Barber, Doe Mill, and Manzanita area. Keefer Rd if you don't mind living on the edge of town. Living near Bidwell park would also be nice, but the homeless population could make it less favorable. 

There are many unique, beautiful old homes in Chico if you can afford it (my dream at one point) but the ""fixer market"" has been gone through so it'll be full price. Durham is 15 minutes away and it's a nice little area if you want some space. It is more conservative, depending on if that's a pro/con for you. 

A lot of people mentioned the weather as a con, but if you live in AZ you can get an idea. Very hot summers, moderate winters. Depends on what you are used to and can tolerate. Get a good A/C and solar and you're set 😂

If your interest/career based needs are met here, it isn't a bad place to live, but I think a lot of locals are holding on to the old image of Chico and what it was, and trying to promote that. Instead they could be focusing on the problems the city now has and a way to fix them. I hope this didn't sound too negative because I don't mean that! The value just isn't here for us based on our interests and needs. I don't believe Chico is less than ideal for everyone.
