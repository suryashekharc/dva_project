">It's not me being a NIMBY, I'm not even in Canada right now lol. 

Then, why are you so bothered about what is happening in Mississauga of all places? You are in SF or something, right? Why do you care? I can only assume that it must be because you own property here. Or do you regularly go around talking about places you have never lived in or could have a say in? 

>I laid out for you the legitimate challenges that you would face trying to get that thru the planning department. If that bothers you maybe go and show up to planning meetings in person and give this speach there instead. I'd arm yourself with better arguments before you do so tho.

I don't need to... the city hires lawyers, city-planners, architects, etc. to do that for them. The NIMBYs have the same stuff... the government just has a lot more money, lawyers and ""pull"".

I am not happy about building shitty stuff the way they are showing in that ruddy diagram either. However, land/house hoarding has gone on too long and people are literally not having a place to rent/buy. The government of Canada cannot get the BoC to raise interest rates; credit is so cheap, they are literally paying people to buy more debt... which they use to buy more land/house... then the landlords get all pissy when their renters cannot afford to pay their over-bloated mortgages for them and clog up the LTB with complaints about renters refusing to leave. To top that, Canada is raising immigration numbers... and refugees. Where are all these new people supposed to stay? 

So yeah, it is a shitty plan... but better than no bloody plan at all. People won't stop hoarding land/houses, the BoC won't raise rates, the housing market keeps worsening... leaving the government no choice and they will end up building wherever it can. People looking to sell won't sell to regular people because those folks cannot afford a bidding war, which property developers can get into and easily win. 

I cannot see eye-to-eye with a NIMBY... we agree to disagree.

">There's ways of building denser that aren't awful like what's described in the picture. Generally you need a bigger lot, area for parking, and you'd want an on-site park/amenities.

i.e. so long as it is ""not in my backyard"" basically

>In addition you have to build it in such a way that your neighbors aren't going to go to war with you because they will. 

The neighbors cannot pick a fight with the tenants. They will have to take it up with the developer... developers typically happen to have tremendous financial backing for this kind of claptrap that arises... and in addition, many have government backing as well \[read - all-access to the money-printer\]. They also happen to have several lawyers on retainer. 

>Like seriously is not easy to change a lots zoning, 

I never said it was... but can be done and has been done. 

>you have to produce a convincing argument as to why it's nessesary in that specific spot and theres a public comment process to it too. You can't just say fuck it to your neighbors because in the real world people hire lawyers, planners and other architects to produce a convincing arguments as to why this building will negatively effect the community.

and in this case, if it is the government... well, they have lawyers too (and the rest of all the trappings) and lots of money to boot (they can literally print it if they want). 

>Yes if you go out to dieing cities you may have been able to get things like this permitted in the past, not in Mississauga.

Said like a true NIMBY! ""You cannot live in a shoe-box in the sky!"" ""You have no idea how much this will cost over 20 years!"" \[Heard all these shite arguments before\]. 

>I'm an advocate of density too.

No. You clearly are not. You are a NIMBY parading as one of the others and it is laughably crystal clear... no idea why you are bothering to lie about it though. I don't care if you are NIMBY or not. 

> I'm all for having buying a series of existing residential homes, joining the properties and sticking a tower onto it that abutts a major road, has underground parking and is well connected to a walkable community and transit lines. That's the ideal that needs to be strived for.

... and because it is so idealistic, it cannot be done in reality, correct? i.e. NIMBYism at its finest! Well done! 

>In addition, if these guys were to somehow convince the planning department that upzonning that lot was for the good of community, then the adjacent property values wouldn't nessesaily drop. If the argument is convincing enough and they don't receive much push back from the community other developers would come in and try to buy the adjacent properties and argue the same merits.

I'm actually surprised at this. If you rated your pain at let's say a 7 and where in that much pain you were screaming your heart rate would be elevated. They usually prioritize severe  abdominal pain as that could have been ovarian torsion. I one time had a period that wouldn't stop and a walk in sent me bc I had symptoms of severe blood loss (low BP etc). I waited an hr with a nurse who called me every 15min to take my BP.

"Some background of myself… I am born in Canada and coming from an atheist point of view. And I am a millennial/gen y/ gen z - or whatever the term is. When I was growing up in a public grade school, none of these types of holidays or religions were celebrated. There was the more “mainstream” or major holidays, such as Christmas or Easter. I was never taught the true meaning of these holidays other than a big red guy coming down my non-existing chimney and a giant rabbit that poops out chocolate eggs. Might I add, having days off from school was a bonus. 

I see the difference as being taught this religion/holiday versus being exposed to this religion/holiday. This type of exposure can help uplift children of all ages in seeing their holidays/religions being mentioned during school. They are able to connect their own culture in a classroom setting; perhaps seeing their friends from other cultures/religions celebrating what they do at home is overall joyous and harmonious, in my opinion. A classroom is a place to learn and grow. I do not see any harm in celebrating another holiday/religion in a public school - now if they were to discuss depths of a certain religion, is where I would draw the line.

While, Christmas and Easter are Catholic/Christian holidays, which is taught more in depth about in the Dufferin-Peel Catholic School Board. I went to a DPCSB school for high school. I was, then, only taught more in depth about other religions, such as Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism etc.

I wish I was exposed to the different cultures and religions to better my understanding of my classmates of who they are and what their culture/religions/holidays meant to them. This is the start to creating a more accepting future for the generations to come. 

A few cultural songs & fun dancing is not going to do your child any harm. Let them have their fun while they are young.

Also isn’t music a huge no-no in Islam so I don’t particularly understand your point there.

"Lol you’re a dumbass. Your comment doesn’t stand, it’s literally wrong. The municipalities have the legal mechanisms to keep whatever mandates in place that they want. This isn’t Florida, Ford didn’t make mask mandates illegal he just lifted the provincial wide mandate. Each region can continue to have whichever restrictions they think is necessary. 

And no one was crossing boundaries because of mask mandates, it was closures and capacity restrictions they were trying to get around. The reason people did that is because Doug Ford is a shit premier who refuses to listen to scientists and the municipalities had to take action one by one to force him into taking cohesive action, but not before he looked like the ducking clown he is for a couple of weeks.

"> Now you mention the illegal parked vehicle, I used the reporting function before. No one ever came. The vehicle was on the scene for many hours.

How do you know nobody ever came? 

>My surveillance camera had the record.

We drive unmarked vehicles that look like any other vehicle driving on your street. You wouldn't have known if we attended unless we exited our vehicle and you saw us in uniform. We are able to run plate numbers without ever getting out our car. If the vehicle in question had a parking consideration, which you would never know about because we don't disclose that information, no ticket would be issued and we would leave. 

>If it takes days for someone to come by then I shouldn’t even report.

It doesn't take days and you clearly didn't read what I said before. We have up to 24 hours to attend but we are typically on the scene within 60-90 minutes from when we are dispatched. If it takes longer, it's just because we are busy and have other service requests ahead of yours. 

>The frustration at the law enforcement and the government is real with all the good reasons. Anyway, it’s not your fault or anyone here. I will move on.

Your frustration is real but you need to temper your expectations. It is clear that you are making assumptions without knowing all of the facts. Just because you don't see us that doesn't mean we didn't attend. Just because you see a vehicle parked on the street for hours that does not mean they are breaking the law. Just because you don't like something that doesn't mean the other party should be penalized. Sometimes you just need to accept the fact that you are going to have to tolerate behaviour from your neighbours that you can't do anything about. Just like they sometimes have to tolerate your behaviour.",t2_h1sdg,throwawaylogin2099,0,1647729977.0,0,t1_i1c54z0,i1c54z0,False,AdventurousExternal1,t3_t262ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississauga/comments/t262ds/stay_classy_mississauga_drivers_car_parked_on/,Stay classy Mississauga drivers - car parked on pedestrian crosswalk in Streetsville,/r/mississauga/comments/t262ds/stay_classy_mississauga_drivers_car_parked_on/i1c54z0/,1,r/mississauga,0,1

If the vehicle is still present when the officer arrives and a violation is taking place only then will a ticket be issued, not before.",t2_h1sdg,throwawaylogin2099,0,1647727830.0,0,t1_i1c0bic,i1c0bic,False,AdventurousExternal1,t3_t262ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississauga/comments/t262ds/stay_classy_mississauga_drivers_car_parked_on/,Stay classy Mississauga drivers - car parked on pedestrian crosswalk in Streetsville,/r/mississauga/comments/t262ds/stay_classy_mississauga_drivers_car_parked_on/i1c0bic/,1,r/mississauga,0,1

"We can't do that for bylaw violations because legally the officers have to personally observe the offence being committed. The reason for that is so we can clearly establish which offence is being committed along with when and where it is occurring. It isn't enough to just email a photo of a car sitting next to a no parking sign. Random photos submitted by anonymous persons without relevant context like dates, time or locations, which are essential elements required to establish guilt, are useless. 

Let's look at the photo the OP posted. We can see a vehicle parked in a crosswalk next to a no parking sign but what things can't we see? We can't see the license plate number, or the date and time when this vehicle was parked. Where did this violation happen? I know where this location is because I am familiar with Streetsville but that is a fluke. Most of the time we wouldn't be able to figure that out especially if the vehicle was parked on a residential street without any recognizable landmarks. How exactly would you expect a ticket to be issued with the lack of information provided in this photo?

People are constantly emailing photos of allegedly illegally parked vehicles without providing any other relevant information. We also have no idea if photos have been altered in some way which is very easy to do right on your phone with certain apps. We wouldn't be able to tell if somebody photoshopped a no parking sign into a photo or altered a license plate number in an effort to get somebody ticketed. If you think that is far fetched then you really have no idea how crazy some residents can be when it comes to fucking with their neighbours. Altering a photo is nothing compared to some of the things I've seen.

The system is set up the way it is to protect the public from mistakes and abuses. If you opened the enforcement process by lowering the bar for acceptable evidence then that will create more problems than it will solve. If you really want to make a difference then contact your councillor and tell them to increase the budget for bylaw and hire more officers.",t2_h1sdg,throwawaylogin2099,0,1647726945.0,0,t1_i1bybyy,i1bybyy,False,AdventurousExternal1,t3_t262ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississauga/comments/t262ds/stay_classy_mississauga_drivers_car_parked_on/,Stay classy Mississauga drivers - car parked on pedestrian crosswalk in Streetsville,/r/mississauga/comments/t262ds/stay_classy_mississauga_drivers_car_parked_on/i1bybyy/,1,r/mississauga,0,1

If it's a car exhaust like smell you may have a hole in the secondary heat exchanger (also where the condensation drains from) and exhaust is entering the air stream that comes through the vents.  It might not be enough to set off a carbon monoxide detector but is still hazardous.

"Carrytel is a legit company and you'll be fine IF you have no problems. I was with them for a while but after we went wfh we had not one but 2 outages in a short time that lasted more than 24 hours with poor updates from them. 

Was from a cable cut on their end that impacted all of their Ontario cable customers. The first time they gave an automatic minimal credit. The second time only if you called. 

There were other minor blips when my internet would cut out & I cancelled as I needed reliability with wfh and my kids were in remote classes at the time. They also do not have 24/7 support if you have a problem.

Was with Fido for a year, which was okay with a couple outages they fixed quickly. After a year, they refused to extend my promo price although they did for others.

Bell FTTH had just been installed in our area so I tried it and I could never go back. After I cancelled and arranged Bell, Fido retentions called to offer a deal but it was too late. FTTH isn't available everywhere but it's been flawless. No outages or drops. I would never go back to cable... And if Fido had extended my deal I never would have even tried Bell.

For Bell, it's a promo price for TV/internet phone of $99/month for the first year. Then it will go up substantially.

"The redevelopment has always been far off. In fact it shouldn’t even be referred to as a redevelopment plan, it’s more of a vision. It’s always been intended to be a gradual, phased redevelopment which will likely take 25+ to unfold. There’s next to zero demand for office space in downtown Mississauga - it’s always been this way, but Covid has probably worsened it. It’s something the City (and likely Oxford) is actively working on, and until they’re able to attract a multitude of office tenants, we likely won’t see much in the way of development.

I went to high school at Port Credit. It's basically an upscale and older suburban neighbourhood with some beautiful homes. Lots of old trees and greenery. Your neighbours will be mostly white.

The Port Credit business area is about a 20-30 minute walk away and everyone in Mineola is too rich to walk and shop. It's very close to the QEW so it's pretty easy to get to Toronto.
