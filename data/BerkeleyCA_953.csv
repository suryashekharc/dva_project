"Come celebrate my new album with me at The Back Room. This is my first time returning to the Bay Area since 2020 and plan to bring the house down. 

During the show I include an educational piece on the history of the Seven String Guitar and perform jazz standards and original songs, some bebop, and soul. And a special treat will be the jazz reimaginings of (yacht) rock, R&B, and pop songs all from my critically acclaimed new release, ""Standards And My Songs"". The album is currently on the Jazz radio charts at #25 and destined to go higher.

"I live in a 100 year old shack directly on top of the Hayward Fault.  There's a slide zone a block away.  The regional park system is less than a mile up the hill and poorly managed in terms of fire.  The roads are narrow and twisty making evac during a disaster difficult.  Fire generally follows big quakes.  A big quake will bust water lines making fighting a fire after a quake very difficult.  My expectation is a post quake fire in the hills will burn to the flats.  On the other hand it's quiet and safe and while I don't have a killer view that postcard is right around the corner or just across the street.  I've lived here most of my life.  The only place I'd move to is warm and on the coast.  

Your risk tolerance for fires and earthquakes will determine whether they're big enough deal breakers.  As others have said not all hill homes are the same.  Slide zone vs not a slide zone.  On top of the fault or not though I'm not sure a mile or two make all that much difference.  Steepness of the lot might matter to you especially as you age.  Is transit important to you?

TL;DR - if you can afford it, I’m sure you’ll love it. 

The hills are beautiful and you definitely feel far away from the hustle and bustle of the east bay. If you like that sort of seclusion I’m sure you’ll love it. My wife and I went house hunting during the pandemic and looked at a few homes in the hills. Ultimately ended up buying a home in South Berkeley. Primarily it was a financial decision (the hills seem to be about 25+% more per sq ft than in South Berkeley). However, we were both pretty uncomfortable with the natural hazard risk. You’ve got fires, seismic and landslide concerns. That being said, if you’ve got the cash it’s probably not  too huge of a concern, since you can probably buy a fancy home owners insurance policy. 

Also, those really tall decks creep the hell out of me.

"All areas are not equal when it comes to fires or especially earthquakes. You can be in the hills and be a mile or more from the fault or literally on top of it. My advice is more like do your diligence on each property you look at.

But ultimately it was slow-motion sliding down the hill; it had already lost part of the patio.

"I live in the area and it has a lot of perks. Walking distance to restaurants, shopping, BART, Berkeley campus, etc. You won't get much noise from University and the neighborhood is remarkably quite. The park itself is very nice and is quite popular for families (and check out the bagels on Sundays).

That being said, there are people who live in their cars on that street, homeless people do pass through the greenway and some of those streets, and some blocks on the south side of the park feel a bit less safe.

"I can’t speak for whatever reasoning Berkeley NIMBYs have for wanting an enrollment freeze, but I’ve seen summaries about it. There’s nothing to “save” about Berkeley neighborhoods, and Berkeley isn’t a small quiet town. I’ve lived in Berkeley my entire 32 years of life and it’s always been a bustling town. Sure, it depends on where in Berkeley you live. I’m in south Berkeley where my family has always rented, and it’s always been busy, lots of noise, lots of people. There have always always always been unhoused people in Berkeley, they just get pushed around to different parts of the city. People used to camp out right next to the downtown Berkeley BART station, then the city “beautified” everything and pushed unhoused people elsewhere (though I do recognize that there are far more unhoused people here than ever before). So the arguments I’ve seen saying that more students would ruin the small town feel of Berkeley must not be getting out of their little north Berkeley bubble much. 

And at the same time, yes, low income residents/families have definitely struggled to find housing in Berkeley when they’re competing with students who are also desperate for housing and are easily exploitable by scummy landlords (and sometimes have parents that will pay the ridiculous market rate rent that landlords are charging). My own family experienced this when the house we lived in burned down when I was 16. No one would rent a 2 bedroom apartment to more than 2 people, which is a really messed up way of blocking out families who need to find housing (and to favor students who will rent short term, move out, and then allow landlords to increase rent again). 

But there’s also been a larger issue with gentrification going on throughout the entire Bay Area that can’t be linked to an increase in students alone. The tech industry brought a huge influx of people to the Bay Area, and despite all the money people in tech make, even they got pushed out of San Francisco, and have recently started renting or buying houses in the East Bay. 

And I know the city of Berkeley is trying to come up with new housing plans, but it’s moving super slow. I worry that by the time new housing is built, even if it offers below market units, most longtime low income Berkeley residents will be long gone. Luckily my mom and I are in a place that has rent control, otherwise we’d be priced out. And we’ve seen our neighborhood shift and change immensely over the years. The house next to us that families always rented is now jam packed with Berkeley graduate students and folks who work in tech (and they aren’t as friendly/neighborly as previous neighbors we’ve had, but whenever, they’re fine). 

That said, the university absolutely needs to step back an reassess how many students it’s admitting. The university doesn’t even have enough housing for the students that are currently enrolled. Even when I was an undergrad in 2017, I knew so many students who were unhoused, couch surfing, living out of their car, or were commuting from an hour or more away to get to campus. That’s obviously a huge issue. Not to mention the campus currently doesn’t have the resources and amenities to cater to a huge influx of students. Departments are struggling with funding and don’t have enough instructors to teach classes, there aren’t enough grad students to grade undergraduate work. So the issue is complex, and it’s definitely irresponsible for UC Berkeley to keep increasing enrollment without accounting for all of these other interconnected issues. I would love if the university built more student housing, but I also know there are folks in Berkeley trying to block that too. However, I would love for Berkeley to build housing for its *current* students, rather than building with the intention of maxing out enrollment even more. 

So while I don’t necessarily agree with the intentions of NIMBY Berkeley homeowners (because honestly, how is any of this *really* impacting them?), but I do think that UC Berkeley needs to be more responsible and address the wide range of problems that current students are facing. I work at UC Berkeley and I can’t tell you how many students I see that are straight up just not okay, struggling really hard with poor mental health, poor physical health, are caring for loved ones, are working full time, and are slipping through the cracks left and right. For a university that praises itself for being top tier, and for providing an exceptional education, it’s inexcusable that it isn’t doing more to assist its current students. Students can’t thrive academically if they’re dead broke, unhoused, and on the brink of a total breakdown.",t2_4nh166gv,saxaphonessuck,0,1646427811.0,0,t1_hzd6nvf,hzd6nvf,True,jaqueh,t3_t61rf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeleyca/comments/t61rf3/uc_berkeley_ordered_to_freeze_enrollment_at_2020/,UC Berkeley ordered to freeze enrollment at 2020 levels,/r/berkeleyca/comments/t61rf3/uc_berkeley_ordered_to_freeze_enrollment_at_2020/hzd6nvf/,2,r/berkeleyca,0,2

Condition of your place may give landlord cause to seek eviction. There's organizations that can help you if it's really bad.

If just too much stuff, what's worked for me is a combination of flip top home depot storage bins and plastic shoeboxes. Lots of shoeboxes. White duct tape and a sharpie to label them. Take a pic of the contents, include the label so you can have an idea what's in them.

Just put EVERYTHING in boxes. EVERYTHING. Don't sort, just box. Get some cheap wire rack shelves for the shoeboxes. (you can make shelf unit from PVC pipe and cardboard [https://imgur.com/a/VVOfOUe](https://imgur.com/a/VVOfOUe) \- this one holds 48 boxes) Fliptops can stack 4 or 5 high.

Then maybe get a cleaning person to give you a hand doing a thorough cleaning.

Then at your leisure you can go through the boxes and sort them.

And it would be fine, if you need the space, to just get a small storage unit for a few months, gives you some room to work.",t2_j604b,sock2014,0,1646088654.0,0,t1_hyu8pgc,hyu8pgc,False,[deleted],t3_t3qa3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeleyca/comments/t3qa3a/landlord_wants_photos_of_my_apartment/,Landlord wants photos of my apartment,/r/berkeleyca/comments/t3qa3a/landlord_wants_photos_of_my_apartment/hyu8pgc/,8,r/berkeleyca,0,8

"1) Not sure there is evidence that ""California doesn’t like too many people in one area"".  In many situations NIMBYs have an oversized influence, especially in wealthy areas.  That isn't the same thing as a broad policy consensus. 

Most state-wide housing initiatives have passed/failed with pretty thin margins (e.g., 52 to 48).  In the Bay area 49% believe the current rate of construction is too little and 21% think it is about right. I'd love to see any polling or evidence to support your claim.  

2) Just about anywhere with the infrastructure to build a large university is going to have a similar NIMBY response. UC Merced has less than 9k students (including grad programs) over 15 years in.  We have lost ~20k spots with this decision about UCB.  I think you are going to get a very similar NIMBY response in most places you could realistically plunk down a new 20k plus student university (access to at least a regional airport and other transit links, available land, etc.)

3) We can add 5k students a year to UC Berkeley in the next couple of years if we build the housing.  Starting a brand new University, especially one that could handle 20k students, would probably take well over a decade.

"The bike path from the Albany Bulb north towards Costco is nice and flat and runs north all the way to the Rosie the Riveter Museum / Craneway Pavilion. It also runs from the Bulb south past Golden Gate Fields (the race track) but there's a big hill in that direction.

If you start just N of Costco in Richmond you can go for miles to the Craneway without crossing any roads.

At the north end approaching the Richmond Marina there are some very smooth segments with nice views. There are multiple entry points with easy parking.

"Hard to find a good metric to enforce this, but the best I could find was the animal shelter intake numbers:

• Berkeley reports 517 dogs processed through the shelter, for a population of 121,485. Ratio of \~235:1• San Francisco reports 1991 dogs processed through the shelter for the same time period, for a population of 874,961. Ratio of \~439:1

So, based on this metric, there are more dogs in Berkeley than SF. However, let's compare a more rural part of the bay area:

• Marin county reports 899 dogs processed through the shelter for a population of 258,826. Ratio of \~287:1

So it would appear to be accurate that cities have fewer dogs, but also that Berkeley in particular has a lot of dogs.  Part of that could also be that it's right next to one of the [largest dog parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Isabel_Regional_Shoreline) in the United States.  The same article linked indicates that most of the EBRPD's parks allow dogs offleash.

It’s a transit hub - with North Berkeley BART station, several AC Transit bus lines. 

Great park Ohlone Park across North Berkeley BART station. We have a dog it’s fantastic! Park runs for blocks. 

We both commute to SanFrancisco daily only 30 minutes on BART.

There’s a great food corridor off on San Pablo & University, Latino groceries, German restaurant, Donut shop, Spanish restaurant, Italian restaurant, etc. 

We don’t own a car not needed we do GIG car - car sharing(Prius) for local errands, or Uber/LYFT.

Maybe.  Florida has done pretty well at protecting their elderly. They were the first state to reject the CDC's recommendation to give the first vaccines to first responders and frontline workers and gave them to the elderly instead.  They also sent mobile teams into nursing homes to distribute vaccines.  I think the larger difference right now is that California has had measures in place for longer and a higher % of their population vaccinated.  Florida and California were pretty even in deaths until the delta wave that just went through Florida.

">If the police numbers were falsified or otherwise inaccurate, then Walgreens would have stated that.

1) Nobody said falsified. 2) What incentive does Walgreen's corporate spokesman have to wade into the fray on something that's become a political hot-button issue about a handful of stores that they've already decided to close? They had no reason to expect their press release to become a national story, and now that it is there's no upside for them to keep pressing the point.

> Looking at items locked up on shelves isn't objective either; it's still anecdotal. 

But it *is* objective. Items are either locked up or not, you can see it with your eyes. They are facts that a person can draw their own conclusions about. 

> For example the safeway on shattuck locks up a good amount of the liquor, but you can go down to the bevmo on san pablo where plenty of the stuff that gets locked up at safeway is sitting on a shelf, unlocked. Without knowing the store policies behind what gets locked up and what is left out on shelves, we can only speculate as to the logic behind the decision, and there's nothing objective about speculation.

The discrepancy in your example isn't some unknowable mystery. It is the result of stores responding to the incentives of their environment, and can be easily understood with just a bit of common sense. Liquor is a major target of shoplifiting in grocery stores because it's something that a lot of underage people want and can't legally buy. If all the liquor was just sitting on the shelf, it would be very easy for a teenager to come into a Safeway, pocket something, and walk back out. If any store made it too easy to shoplift liquor, word would get around, there would be a lot of theft, and the store could possibly even get into trouble for it.

This is less of a problem for a liquor store precisely because they only sell liquor. For one thing, nobody would open a store just to lock up their entire inventory, that would be ridiculous. For another, shoplifiting is much easier for a liquor store to prevent. There's no reason for an underage kid to even go inside unless they're accompanied buy a parent or something.  A teenager who walks in, wanders over to an area where the clerk can't see them, and then walks back out without buying anything is going to be *really suspicious*. 

Everybody's been to a bunch Walgreens or similar stores in their lives, they know what they're like. The fact that it's visibly gotten much worse in the past few years, and only in this region (as opposed to a corporation-wide change in policy) that tells you that local conditions have changed. And because locks ups reduce sales the only reasons for a store to ever lock things up are either regulations (which don't apply to ice cream or shaving supplies) or shoplifiting. There's no other explanation that makes sense, unless you're tying yourself in knots trying to avoid a conclusion you don't like.

>  And as for the Macy's losing money, is that actual lost money, or just lost sales? If I buy some item from a supplier for a dollar and sell it for five, if it gets stolen I've only lost a dollar, not five. I wouldn't be too shocked that a Macy's would have a high dollar value in shrinkage if you go by retail prices; they're not cheap. Their sales prices however point to a significant markup, so they're not actually losing that much money.

I'll assume, for the sake of argument, that your analysis of the Macy's situation is 100% correct, and Macy's can easily afford a lot of shoplifiting because of their high margins. That doesn't mean other businesses can. I only brought up Macy's because it was another piece of evidence that shoplifting has become a bigger problem *in general* than you would think from simply counting police reports.",t2_kaea,Sparky_Z,0,1635025801.0,0,t1_hhsdwmm,hhsdwmm,False,[deleted],t3_qe97v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeleyca/comments/qe97v0/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/berkeleyca/comments/qe97v0/deleted_by_user/hhsdwmm/,1,r/berkeleyca,0,1
"I was looking for similar things, and I gave Berkeley a try for 3 years - however, the crime, homelessness, and general ""full"" feeling of Berkeley had us leaving.

We lived in 2 places in the flats (North and South), and one place a little closer to Shattuck. All were more expensive than they were worth (small, low quality housing while repeatedly hit by crime).  


We've since moved to Vallejo, where our experience with crime has DRASTICALLY decreased (In Berkeley are car was broken into more times than I can count, homeless people tried to squat in our laundry room, and tons of stuff stolen from our garage).   


In Vallejo we could afford to buy a house, the city is cleaner, and the views are better/more affordable.

I grew up in a relatively high crime city; it's not like shoplifting wasn't an issue before prop 47, and certainly there were cases of organized retail theft on the news back when we had our old tough on crime laws in place.  Walgreens may be having issues with shoplifting here compared with their national average, but I strongly doubt that any store in particular they are closing for ""shoplifting"" is truly being closed for that reason.  If we go off of the data released by the police, those particular 5 stores all showed a general reduction in shoplifting incidents.  This points to some additional factor, such as profitability, driving the closures.  Sure, the straw that broke the camel's back may have been shoplifting, but it wouldn't have changed the fact that the stores were underperforming.  If you sell a thousand of something a day and 50 get stolen, that's only 5% of your revenue lost.  If you sell 100 a day and 50 get stolen, you lost 50%.  If you decide to close shop because losing 50% is unsustainable, you could claim that theft forced you to close, but the reality is that you could not sell enough to offset your losses from the theft, not that theft caused you to close.",t2_cijz7,notFREEfood,0,1635019926.0,0,t1_hhs10va,hhs10va,False,[deleted],t3_qe97v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeleyca/comments/qe97v0/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/berkeleyca/comments/qe97v0/deleted_by_user/hhs10va/,0,r/berkeleyca,0,0

"Why are you so willing to believe that police data represents the ground truth, when we know that 1) There are obviously going to be some number of incidents that go unreported, so these statistics are, at best, a lower bound, and 2) higher crime numbers are embarrassing to the police and city government, (especially if they go up during the current leadership's tenure), so if there is a major discrepancy, they have no incentive to dig in and make the numbers more reflective of reality.

I think a more objective indicator that shoplifting really is a problem has been the progression of more and more items locked up on shelves. The last thing retailers want to do is add more friction to a transaction, so this strikes me as an absolute last resort, and not something that would be done on a whim. (Also, it would definitely result in fewer sales. That's an example of a way that rampant shoplifting *risk* can reduce a store's revenue, even if the measures they have to take result in fewer actual instances of crime.)

Also, anecdotally, a friend of mine used to manage security guards, and still keeps in touch with a lot of people. I remember a conversation I had with him about the enormous amount of money that the Union Square Macy's was losing every week due to shoplifting, according to the people who work there. This conversation was in 2019, before the pandemic, and before this issue became a political football. And not a public statement of any kind, so there was no posturing involved.

The landlord probably just said they were going to raise the rent and corporate determined the store wasn't profitable enough for the rent increase.",t2_cijz7,notFREEfood,1,1635010824.0,0,t1_hhrgjg2,hhrgjg2,True,[deleted],t3_qe97v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeleyca/comments/qe97v0/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/berkeleyca/comments/qe97v0/deleted_by_user/hhrgjg2/,2,r/berkeleyca,0,2

Definitely 1000 Oaks/top of Solano area in Berkeley (or Albany which is basically the middle of Solano). If you go higher up in the hills you can't walk anywhere and the last mile getting home sucks (but the views are great). Kensington and the surrounding El Cerrito area is nice (near El Cerrito High) but slightly more suburban and BUSD (and Albany schools) has their shit together much more than WCCUSD if that matters to you (I have kids in both districts as we moved from Richmond and my stepson didn't want to switch schools halfway through middle school).,t2_3mps3,v_krishna,0,1635002355.0,0,t1_hhqydkg,hhqydkg,True,atomstore,t3_qe5p25,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeleyca/comments/qe5p25/recommendations_for_a_family_friendly_neighborhood/,Recommendations for a family friendly neighborhood?,/r/berkeleyca/comments/qe5p25/recommendations_for_a_family_friendly_neighborhood/hhqydkg/,4,r/berkeleyca,0,4

"Right, the other answers so far are correct. Your lease is part of the building, essentially, so when it is sold nothing really changes legally speaking. But the new owners may try things.

With an owner move-in eviction, the owner has to meet a lot of conditions, and you must be given $21,788 relocation since your tenancy started before 1999. Then the owner or relative must live there for at least 3 years. https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/Owner_Move-Ins_Explanation_of_Owner_s_Obligations.aspx

For a buy-out, you have a lot of leverage. Unless you actually want to move or downsize, I wouldn't even consider it as an option. But even 10 years of the change in rent (about $100,000) could be a reasonable upper bound in terms of the numbers, though a landlord might not perceive that as fair. Five years seems like a good middle ground. https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Home/Tenant_Buyout_Ordinance.aspx

"I'm in West Berkeley and it's great for my needs. It's not super far from BART but if you do need to be close to BART then yea, look around the N.

"Adult league is every Saturday they use both fields sometimes for multiple games all day long. Parking gets pretty damn tough when they are in season.

Weekday evenings varying the days of the week there are children’s leagues. Again often using both fields at once after football is done (or earlier when the youth football isn’t in season)

All summer long the children’s camps use them for both baseball and kickball.

I don’t know any of the exact schedules but I can literally see and hear them play from my house. The lights allow these games to also take place much later than most people would play other sports pretty late into the evening in SP park. I suspect the other parks are also getting used more frequently than you think.
