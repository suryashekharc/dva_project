"Just gonna paste this text from a strong towns article on the matter. 

the shoup test is a simple rule of thumb for determining what the market price of parking ought to be in your neighborhood. the answer is whatever price makes it so that there's just one space open on each block, on each side of the street, at any given time.

if we set the price to pass the shoup test, we make it so people won't cruise around the block looking for parking. if the price is right, it serves to calibrate demand so that people can find the space they need quickly, and those who are willing to walk a bit farther, carpool, bike, or take public transit are incentivized to do so. in addition, more convenient spaces (for example, right on the curb on a busy block of main street) will be priced higher than less convenient ones (for example, a couple blocks away on a side street) to reflect their higher demand, which will make them turn over more frequently. this is good for local businesses, who want those parking spaces to be available to their customers, not hogged all day by a single vehicle.

Here‚Äôs shoup on the startling costs of cruising:

A study of cruising in one 15-block business district in los angeles found that, over the course of a year, the search for underpriced curb parking created about 950,000 excess vehicle miles of travel‚Äîequivalent to 38 trips around the earth, or four trips to the moon. and here‚Äôs another inconvenient truth about underpriced curb parking: cruising those 950,000 miles wastes 47,000 gallons of gasoline and produces 730 tons of carbon dioxide. if all this happens in one small business district, imagine the cumulative effect of all cruising in throughout the united states.",t2_2q7tpgns,yallvnt,0,1648175749.0,0,t1_i20lyg3,i20lyg3,True,Corpsman223,t3_tmjqzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pensacola/comments/tmjqzd/city_is_considering_doubling_parking_rates/,City is considering doubling parking rates downtown.,/r/Pensacola/comments/tmjqzd/city_is_considering_doubling_parking_rates/i20lyg3/,3,r/Pensacola,0,3

He‚Äôs started shit with foreign countries like Iran and made that completely worse and almost brought us to war. Everyone wants to parade him for the tiny bit of fair relations he had with Kim Jung Un yet right at the end of his presidency he showed his colors and completed changed tunes about Trump.

Biden is just being friendly to children; he hasnt touched them or anything. Older people have had a different way of being friendly as they grew up in complete different generations and didnt understand and they didnt see those things as pedophillic or even hinting towards that in anyway.

He‚Äôs never made that out to be sexual in any way and the man is way old so he mayve not felt inclined to explain the demeanor of that more.

His age contributes little to his ability as president; Trump was 74 when he left office and Biden is 79.

"The two party system is a fa√ßade designed to keep citizens polarized and divided.

That being said, I've seen the direct result of local, extreme democratic policies up close and personal. I no longer feel safe being in Seattle after darkness, and avoid it unless I am required to be there. Daytime is still perfectly safe in the more touristy-places, though.

Olympia used to be a beautiful little city. It is still more or less okay to be around at night, but the nightlife has all closed up, moved away, or are still open but with only one or two patrons.

"Bartending at a Pensacola golf course:

PROS:- Most golfers have jobs and money- Most golfers are reliable and consistent.- Most golf course bars are chill with hardly any fights

CONS:- Golf courses are seasonal.- Your clients will be a very small group of people, older, typically bad tippers- Typically no music or ""good"" music is played. Not a space that keeps them there for long- Typically limited to wine and beer (\*fewer sales = fewer tips)

\-TONS OF BETTER OPTIONS Pensacola has badass beaches, badass bars, better than any golf course. Just around the corner is the Flora Bama, one of the nation's best beach bars (Playboy  Magazine, Maxim Magazine) with a ton of smaller great bars heading from Perdido to Alabama line.

\- Not that golfers don't drink but it's not like a beach bar where your sales will be tripled and your tips consistently doubled. There is typically live music, young people, attractive young women, pool, bikinis, and a totally different vibe than a golf course. 

\- Weather impacts everything and nobody golfs in rainstorms and Pcola has a ton-

(CODA) A lot depends on you and your skillset. Don't worry if you have not worked in a high-volume bar as you can learn - just don't lie about it, especially at a bar like the Flora Bama as your fellow bartenders will know immediately just by watching you with the tools in your hand (Psst, they WILL be watching). Most bars in Pensacola are accustomed to bringing on new people so just get in where you fit in as you obviously have experience and have some skills to offer. A general rule is that higher sales bars have seasoned bartenders who can sling their asses off and keep it moving. Just so you have a metric to compare to, during the summer, it is common for a busy beach bartender to sell 2-3k in a shift!!. You can always take a job at this type of bar and work the slower areas/shifts to get your acumen. At one point, barbacks at the Florabama were entitled to half the tips!!! Yes, you heard that right as its a tough job out there. This may have changed but, as I did, you can start by barbacking to get the vibe and learn and you are off. If you need year-round money that is somewhat consistent, go for well-established bars (Bama, Hub Staceys) I will let the locals tell you others. Good luck to you and remember my axiom about bartending = ""Bartend like you are flying a plane, with everyone relying on you. Treat it like a business, not a party, all while having fun. Smile, laugh at jokes, keep conversations short and always look around, ALWAYS. Talk to your fellow bartenders and come up with systems for stock, how cash is handled, and how your areas will be kept orderly/clean as IT MATTERS.

"Not sure if it‚Äôs true, but I‚Äôve seen it on forums like this 
‚ÄúFool's gold, also known as pyrite, has a strong acidifying effect, so it drops the pH. In addition to iron, it may also contain heavier metals such as copper, zinc and lead, and because it acidifies the water, it can ""unlock"" heavy metals into their toxic free-ionic forms. Oxygen and natural bacteria in the water oxidize the sulphide component of pyrite to sulphate/sulphuric acid, and the low pH water produced then activates the iron and any other heavy metals present.

"I've volunteered and cleaned litter on the side of the road, and I've never seen anyone throw anything out the window of a car except cigarette butts.  They probably do, but I think it's not the primary source of litter that we see.

While walking or driving, I *have* seen stuff blow out the back of pickups, and out of garbage trucks.  Some of this is intentional carelessness (if you throw an empty fast-food bag in the back of your truck, you're just littering with extra steps) but some is honest mistake.

Also, much of the litter I find is something that looks like it was honest-mistake.  Someone somehow lost a knotted trash bag of garbage out the back of a vehicle and now it's shredded all along the road, or something.

I have a prejudice against Chik-fil-a (whatever) customers too; it seems like I get the most fast-food litter from their stuff, followed by McD's (usually only if they're nearby), followed by a fairly small amount from other sources.  This, even when I'm more than five miles from them.

I've since moved from P'Cola to Key West, and though the full-time residents keep the island pretty tidy, I live on a mangrove canal and the amount of trash I pick out of the roots and water is so disheartening. Now I carry a scoop net and trash bag when I go out kayaking.

Honestly how many pensacola cops are local? How many pensacola locals drive to Alabama to make money during spring  break or even gulf breeze or fort walton. That money isn't invested in pensacola neither the education system of Florida. Again it is not hate just fact. Temples collect cash for maintenance of their pray halls; never invested in their city. Again follow the money...it's not hard unless maybe you are the church stealing money from communities. It is not unique. Taxes are used to better the community...does our community look better? Would the homeless under the interstate agree? I'm not mad not full of hate. Just pointing out the flow of cash. Pensacola doesn't have the education to fight! Read don't take my word for it. I honestly don't care. Pensacola doesn't care why should I? Do you know the avg income level of pensacola...I do.  Do you know how much pensacola collected in taxes? I do.

"I'm not even arguing that with you. You're biting my finger instead of looking where it points. What I am saying is, build all the crosswalks you want. Turn Cervantes into one giant crosswalk that cars have to wait to cross. The idiots who ignore crosswalks will still ignore all the new ones. I'm not talking about places in town with a distinct lack of crosswalks (where there should obviously be more, for the record), I'm talking about crosswalks that have been there for decades, where people still cut through traffic to cross the street less than 50 yards away.

It does no good to build new roads or sidewalks or crosswalks or any other form of publicly maintained pathway for people who refuse to observe traffic law. That's my point. This city has a problem that needs to be solved with the people ignoring the crosswalks that are already there, before we build new ones. Why would we? The ones we already have are being ignored.

"The fix is to have more safe places to cross the street.

If there's 500 feet between each crossing, then people will jaywalk. The underlying problem is poor walkability. The solution is to make the street - and the city as a whole - more walkable. More crosswalks, slower cars. There's a huge difference in survivability between a collission at 25 mph and one at 35 mph.

In most countries, jaywalking isn't a crime, unless it's done in a manner specifically to impede others or cause dangerous situations. E.g. you can cross the street anywhere but you can't just walk along the roadway in the middle of the street. Making jaywalking a crime in and of itself is symptomatic of a society that values car traffic much too highly.

I'm not even saying get rid of cars - I'm just saying that cars are given too much priority, and bicyclists and pedestrians need to be catered to, to a larger degree than they are now.",t2_d8w2e,wasmic,0,1647789638.0,0,t1_i1eubhi,i1eubhi,False,sevenlights1,t3_ti2v4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pensacola/comments/ti2v4x/whats_the_point_of_this_besides_making_our_city/,What‚Äôs the point of this besides making our city look even worse?,/r/Pensacola/comments/ti2v4x/whats_the_point_of_this_besides_making_our_city/i1eubhi/,2,r/Pensacola,0,2

The Organizers then tried to launch a Global Game Jam weekend January 28-30, which focuses totally on game development (digital, board and outdoor), but 3 of our 7 Organizers came down with COVID the week before so we cancelled.

We are looking to schedule another SW this Fall possibly with a gaming theme and would be grateful for volunteers to join us.

Never?  


>Speaking of following traffic laws, you ever see people driving the actual speed limit on this road, or not texting on their phone? What about not signaling for their turn, or turning on red arrows?

"I agree with you. In the real world, investors do whatever they legally can to increase their passive income. Right now, Pensacola is a great investment opportunity. Investors are scooping up houses everywhere they can. That increased demand is lowering the supply of available homes and driving up prices. Increased housing prices leads to investors increasing rent. Many families that have lived here for decades are having to move because they can no longer afford to live here.


If the increased cost of living also came with an increase in higher paying jobs, maybe those families could afford to stay. But no one is going to be able to buy a $300k house when they're making $12/hr as a cleaner.

"Good breakdown. The supply chain problems are also major factors driving inflation all over the economy. 

Two other exacerbating issues worth noting:

- During the lockdown (and to an extent, still today), many people spent their ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù money on stuff, which added to the pandemic-strained issues above. More demand because instead of going to movies or concerts, they just bought more video games or DIY home improvement stuff. 

- This surge, combined with brief shutdowns/limited capacity due to lockdown, caused a backlog in major ports. Specifically, the port of LA, our biggest port and one the only west coast ports capable of handling the mega-container ships. Going around to the East Coast means an additional 3-4 week trek thru the Panama Canal and Gulf Coast (if the ship even fits), or much longer to go around South Africa, Suez Canal, or South America, so most ships just deal with the backlog. 

Building more capacity to remove the port and factory backlogs literally takes years‚Ä¶ AND equipment that, ironically, is built in China and would have to be‚Ä¶ shipped‚Ä¶ and sit in that backlog‚Ä¶ üôÉ

Right now, container ships are waiting multiple weeks off the coast for their turn to unload. To make matters worse, many retailers and wholesalers globally are ordering many things in greater bulk so that, when their shipment *does* come in, they can weather the backlog. Which, ironically‚Ä¶ lengthens the backlog!

This is also a byproduct of the ‚Äújust in time‚Äù global logistics system that has been built over the past 20+ years to be more efficient and economical than older systems, but is quite vulnerable to any part of the system slowing down, and isn‚Äôt  easy to spin back up. To streamline and make things more efficient, these logistic systems were already close to capacity and didn‚Äôt have much headroom. It‚Äôs not really any political faction‚Äôs ‚Äúfault‚Äù; rather, this is what was efficient to do from a business standpoint so that‚Äôs what these companies did. 

It‚Äôs a situation that won‚Äôt likely get better for a couple years, unfortunately.

Edit: There‚Äôs very little Biden or Congress can do to alleviate this problem in the short term (and it‚Äôs not really trump or Obama‚Äôs fault either). In the long term, the best they can do is policies that aggressively promote relocating factories from China to the US,  Canada, or Mexico. Especially bringing critical parts mfg like computer chips back to the US.

But in any case, the existing Keystone pipeline is not shut down. Its still running right now. The only thing Biden shut down was the Keystone XL, which would have taken like 5 years to build, so it wouldn't have had any effect on gas prices now.

But it is funny how you are neglecting to mention how Trump cut a deal with OPEC to cut oil production by 9+ million barrels a day in order to raise the price of oil because it was considered too low at the start of the pandemic. Article from April 2020.

And that deal is still in effect now (it ends at the end of next month).

And oil has been rising at a fairly steady rate since that deal was made.
