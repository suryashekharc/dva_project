Man sentenced to 34 months in prison for raping woman dying from OD

  
LYNNWOOD, Wash. -- A 20-year-old Washington state man was sentenced Thursday to less than three years in prison for raping a high school student as she died from a drug overdose and texting semi-nude photos of her.  


  
Brian Varela had pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter, third-degree rape, and unlawful disposal of remains as part of a plea deal in the February death of 18-year-old Alyssa Noceda.¬†  


  
Superior Court Judge Linda Krese said Thursday she could not sentence Brian Varela to more than 2 years and 10 months because it was the most prison time permitted for someone with no prior criminal record, The Daily Herald reported.  


  
Krese said she was ""surprised, even outraged,"" by the inadequacy of the sentence and suggested that state lawmakers may not have realized the impact of their decision when they set prison sentences for the charges.  


  
""I'm not sure the Legislature really contemplated something like this,"" Krese said.  


  
Varela told detectives that Noceda came to a party on Feb. 3 northeast of the Seattle suburb of Lynnwood. In Varela's room, he said Noceda snorted Percocet and also ingested liquid marijuana, court documents said.  


  
Tests later showed she had taken a fatal mix of fentanyl and alprazolam, a generic name for Xanax.  


  
She collapsed within a minute of mixing the two, Varela told detectives.

  
Authorities said Varela never sought help for Noceda and instead sent semi-nude photos of her to friends and texting ""LOL, I think she od'd, still breathing.""  


  
Varela played an online game until he fell asleep, waking up in the morning to find Noceda's lips blue, court documents said.  


  
He went to work at Dairy Queen and his co-worker contacted police in the following days after Varela said he didn't know if Noceda was still alive when he was having sex with her.  


  
Court records say he told a friend that ""she died having sex with me.""  


  
Police arrested Varela later that day after executing a search warrant and finding Noceda's body in a plastic crate at the suspect's home.  


  
Varela told investigators he planned to bury Noceda with onions to minimize the odor, police said.  


  
He also told detectives that after Noceda died, he used her thumb to unlock her phone Feb. 4 and send messages to make it appear she had run away.  


  
In court Thursday, Varela said only, ""I'm sorry for my foolish actions. Whatever I get is what I deserve.""  


  
Noceda's mother and aunt cried when they learned the likely sentence.  


  
""You might as well let him walk free with that kind of time,"" Noceda's aunt, Rachelle Palmer said.

  
Noceda's mother Gina Pierson told CBS Seattle affiliate KIRO in February that before the teen left home the night she died, she yelled to each of her family members by name and told them she loved them.  


  
Pierson said she had a strange feeling that something bad might happen, but she kept the thought to herself.  


  
""That was the last person my daughter saw,"" Pierson told KIRO of Varela. ""Just made me sick, made me feel sick.""",t2_ag2bf3jz,HipHop_Local_Legends,0,1646593103.0,0,t1_hzlw5qi,hzlw5qi,True,HipHop_Local_Legends,t3_t85mkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/t85mkq/18_year_old_alyssa_noceda_died_from_an_overdose/,"18 year old Alyssa Noceda died from an overdose while snorting pills laced with fentanyl.

A cause I'm passionate about?  In an odd way I'm not passionate about specific causes.  I feel passionate about helping locally.

I think too many people are trying to sway a nation or change the world but really would be more effective helping the people next to you.

Also...I don't have any professional therapy or consulting background or training...but I think I am good at having conversations with people that help them think about their worries and concerns in a way that helps them open up and understand more about themselves, helping them identify wants and needs and identify obstacles. 

I think there's not enough of these kinds of conversations.  But also I don't kniw if that's even an option.

She was confused and asked what was going on and the guy started swinging at her we got her up the stairs I had to jump the railing. Dude violently swinging hit his own lady twice never connected with any of us. I kinda gave a little shove to move him for my other buddy to come up the ramp and he fell and hit his face on the railing. His girl is now taking care of him screaming at us everyone around is screaming at them for trying to fight us. The bartenders didn‚Äôt care. It was wild. Hope they go out of business.

"Edmonds Rotary has Tuesday lunch meetings, where they chat and plan out recurring and one time volunteering events.


I think the Edmonds Foodbank does Wednesday pick ups, which they always welcome help with.


PAWS has both wildlife and domestic animal shelter shifts on Wed/Thurs, but they‚Äôre a huge organization. Applying to volunteer definitely feels more like applying for a job than gifting free labor.


The libraries ran events pre-COVID, and they might be opening back up in the near future. A lot of them moved online, like reading to kids or specific movie watching groups. ‚ÄúFriends of X Library‚Äù is probably where you want to look for volunteering opportunities.


ENAC (Edmonds Neighborhood Action Coalition) runs a whole bunch of events and programs, and has different committees doing just about anything service or community related. Nice people too (I help out with some of their LGBTQ+ programs)


Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County runs a store in Everett, and also direct help closer to Lynnwood/Edmonds (I think; they‚Äôre cagey about their shelter locations for good reason). COVID also threw them for a loop, and I‚Äôm not sure if they can train more volunteers right now, but it‚Äôs worth a shot.


Treehouse is the local (state wide) foster kids organization. They‚Äôre headquartered in Everett as well, I think, but there‚Äôs opportunities all over.

"I should take more pictures of the place. That could be cool. 

Art makes things cool. You can take an ordinary thing and give it some love, attention, and some *art*, whatever that means, and the subject becomes something more than it was before. 

While we're at it, and I'm still drinking: fuck LA and all that shit. It gets too much attention because that just happens to be where *talent* congregates. It's a tragic product of economic realities. But the truth is that many places matter, not just the big places. There's life in the little microcosms of our lives.

The way the three you mentioned have survived is that they are far enough away from each other to not poach potential shoppers from each other and in Alderwoods case trying to abandon the indoor mall shopping for a more walkable space.

Now how will Alderwood compete against a new area for shoppers/diners in their immediate sphere of influence?

"I grew up in Lynnwood and couldn't wait to get out. I remember catching a late-night show on KCMU (pre-KEXP) circa 1997, indie rock from the likes of Sonic Youth and Archers of Loaf (some of the tracks I managed to record to tape), and it absolutely blew my 13-year-old mind: it happened to be an extra clear night and I could never pick up the station again. I tried, but at best I could get a signal blurred with the jazz station next to it. Lynnwood seemed like a million miles away from the world I wanted to be in at the time. 

From the vantage point of 38 now, having spent most of my 20s and early 30s in Seattle and living far away in Mexico City, a city of ‚âà25m people, I think there's some really lovely things about Lynnwood: I think I have enough perspective now. Number one, it's not the same suburb. It was mostly white when I was a kid and now it's pretty diverse. Almost Live did a lot of sketches about butt rockers, Camaros and blue eye shadow in Lynnwood, it was something I was always curious about because I never really saw it in the late 80s and early 90s, but that's obviously satirical of a very particular sort of white culture. I spent a good part of pandemic-days back home and I joined a gym that was really close knit and very diverse. I didn't really feel at the center of that, but I enjoyed seeing it exist in the Lynnwood of 2020-21, and that's a reminder that community is something you create, not just waltz into. Lynnwood also has some great parks and greenery ‚Äî¬†Meadowdale Beach Park comes to mind, and I don‚Äôt know if that's officially Lynnwood or Edmonds, but Meadowdale is Lynnwood so I consider it Lynnwood. That's really a rare park in the world. And Grocery Outlet: I think of it as Mexico City prices but with all kinds of stuff from Whole Foods. It's probably my favorite thing when I visit my hometown, I‚Äôm not making a joke. The mall‚Ä¶I think of the Alderwood Mall in 1994, so the half open-air portion and newer theater (the exalted temple of movies, as it looks to me) looks very swanky and new to me.

"I've seen the bus ... here's my bet. It is part of a crowd control and/or troop transport vehicle controlled by LE. Much like the militarized tank-like vehicle that is usually stashed in the fire station. It is kept by the 'police' near the police department. Likely the vehicle is used for various training exercises. I wouldn't be surprised to see the bus having circled the neighborhood around Fred's ... maybe looking for adequate on-street parking.

">What are you top three ideas to help give Lynnwood a greater sense of place?

1.	Walkability ‚Äì As mentioned by my post and a commenter who sees Lynnwood in a positive light, a car is necessary to get anywhere in town. Unless you are planning to live AT the mall there isn‚Äôt really a good feel anywhere in Lynwood to walk around, window-shop, or just get a feel of being out and about. Bike lanes are almost nonexistent as well. Yes, I am aware of the project being underway on 196th now to improve that area of Lynnwood for this exact purpose but it also is a couple years away and nothing was ever done before this point leaving this town way behind imho as compared to Edmonds, Bothell, Woodinville, and things even Everett has begun implementing downtown and around the waterfront.

2. Public transport ‚Äì Currently there is a single line that passes by my house, and I have to take a 45-minute ride on it to get to the transit center‚Ä¶ So even without the walking again I am left with little option but to drive to a destination.  The light rail is great for getting to Seattle and Swift line is great as a direct shot to another town but there is little option available if you are anywhere off from those thoroughfares.

3. Fewer strip malls and big box stores ‚Äì The city has repeatedly echoed that it wants to develop and become a denser population but continues to build these hollow large parking lot facilities as if that‚Äôs going to do anything in creating a real feel for the town. I hate the parking lot aesthetic and that new Costco and Home Depot being shoehorned into an area that was already congested only makes things feel worse. Bring in more local eateries and hangout kind of places. We have a number of blue-collar sports dives in town but off the top of my head only Indigo comes to mind as a places with a real chill feel to it, no gimmick, in town. How about a brewery or two in the, ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù area? Or a popular caf√© that isn‚Äôt a Starbucks? I was in Seattle the other day and stopped off at Elliot Bay books, that place was amazing, and we only have Barnes and Noble (Another large chain store) with no soul in it.  

I get the need for the box stores in a general sense but the planning of this city to put them in the center was poorly planned how I see it and those should be the kind of places you find on the edges of town, not your main economic district.

Edit: Just a small edit while thinking about it, I'd like to mention a lot of the general places you could hangout in the area have disappeared over the years, one of which I used to frequent as a kid was Walt's Card Shop behind the Taco Time. Can't really say there are many places around like that anymore.",t2_6q1vy,StoicAthos,0,1640917097.0,0,t1_hqmp0eg,hqmp0eg,False,StoicAthos,t3_rrninx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/rrninx/i_dont_think_im_alone_here_but_i_think_lynnwood/,I don't think I'm alone here but I think Lynnwood kind of sucks.,/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/rrninx/i_dont_think_im_alone_here_but_i_think_lynnwood/hqmp0eg/,2,r/LynnwoodWA,0,2

"Check out Teriyaki Wok Express down by the mall for both sushi and teriyaki. My personal favorite teriyaki place is either Teriyaki Grill (try their teriyaki burrito!) or Highway Teriyaki (their standard chicken meal has been a longtime go-to). If you want the true historical flavor, dip down to Toshi‚Äôs Teriyaki in Mill Creek- Toshi himself cooks there, and he‚Äôs the father is Seattle style teriyaki! It was super cool to get a taste of that flavor. If you like really marinated meat, Misora is super good and some of them are open on Sunday (most teriyaki places aren‚Äôt). Teriyaki Garden in Mill Creek is also good, but if you‚Äôre down there you‚Äôll be about a block away from Toshi‚Äôs, and it would be a shame to miss that.

Breakfast you gotta hit up the Mukilteo Speedway Cafe right off Mukilteo speedway. Their food is just A++, and the decor is all old ferry memorabilia! They have sister cafes in Bothell (all airplane/Americana decor) and Mill Creek (logging/timber decor). Also check out Henry‚Äôs Donuts a block down from Mukilteo Speedway Cafe, they‚Äôre open 24h because of Boeing, you gotta try their apple fritters. They‚Äôre huge, and keep nicely for a day or two past purchase.

Dinner I like to go to Ivar‚Äôs Mukilteo Landing. It‚Äôs right at the ferry dock and the food is always so good, they‚Äôve never done me dirty with their salmon. Ivar‚Äôs also has a walk up fish bar if you want some fish n‚Äô chips to go!

"I was in the same boat as well. But had to give in in this crazy market. We closed in Dec 2020 after losing plenty of offers in Kirkland, Redmond, Bothell. A lot of folks put cash offers with the help of flyhomes. We used them as well for few homes but sellers for the homes we lost only cared about the highest offer and not whether it is cash. 

On inspection contingency, there are a few inspectors who can do a quick inspection when you do a tour for a lesser price since its a pretty shallow one. Useful to keep them handy. I was not willing to put an offer on a pre-1980s house without a pre-inspection. For the house I eventually won, it was a 2014 build, I took a gamble as major issues are less likely unless the house is 20+ years old. I did a full inspection after moving in though and thankfully there were no issues. I highly recommend being present for the inspector walkthrough. Useful to know what secrets are hidden in the house.

On appraisal gap, oddly I was hearing lesser stories of appraisals coming low compared to earlier years. Keybank thankfully just waived appraisal in my case. You cant do much about it. Once you develop a thick skin after losing 5+ offers, you just need to remain firm on how much you can stretch your budget without being house poor. Try to keep aside some cash apart from downpayment anyway to use for repairs/fixes before moving in (specially flooring updates or interior painting as they are much much easier without furniture).

Good luck!

I think you will need to be prepared to write a competitive offer and work with a good, local loan officer. The more confident you are in your lender, the more competitive you can be. 

If you look for houses that are past offer review date you might be able to keep some of those contingencies. But a lot of times those houses are less desirable (though sometimes it‚Äôs because they priced too high). 

A lot of houses are pre-inspected and an agent can look up the reviews on the inspector that did that did it.

"I know Chevy's used to be owned by Taco Bell as a means to retain talent from the fast food restaurants, but looking through their Wikipedia page, it's clear the chain has been struggling for a while. 

I know a common tactic with conglomerated restaurants is that the corporation owns the real estate but leases the restaurant to franchisees. I wouldn't be surprised if PepsiCo still owns the real estate, and is sitting on it until it eventually becomes valuable enough (like a transit center improvement turns the block into a new city hub). 

This is all speculation though.

"Lynnwood is only really bad along HW99. Especially that corner where Lake Serene Safeway and that Chevron are located, as well as the next main intersection North (Home Depot) Once you get a block or two off of it though there are plenty of great areas. 

I have been in the area of Lake Stickney (take that road East from the Chevron) for almost a year now with my wife and infant and we love it. Area is going to be pricey for a single family home but that is the price to pay for being close to work. Have never felt unsafe in that area. Everyone we pass walking along the streets is very friendly. Very little loud cars/reckless driving as well.

Our only gripe is that sidewalks are hit or miss. There will be stretches where they cease to exist.

"I moved from Seattle 3 years ago to lynnwood to buy a house. I'm about 8 blocks west of 99 between 178th and 188th and it's full on Mayberry here. We held a big block party bbq this summer, everyone knows their neighbors.  People always out walking dogs, out for a stroll. It's pretty chill. I do live on a dead end street though and the avg house is now $700k in this part of lynnwood. And I'm nowhere near some of the slummy apartments which lynnwood does have a few clusters I'd steer clear of.

People are right though. stretches of 99 can be a little sus at times. Usually late evening. But not nearly as bad as Seattle's stretch of 99. And the worst things we've experienced in 3 years here was some crazy hobo wagging his dick on 99 at 178th, our mailbox got pilfered(switched to locked after) and one neighbor had his ring cam spot a car prowler this summer.

"Yes, racing is an issue. However, most of what we are all hearing are said ‚Äúrace cars‚Äù driving 5 over on their way home. It has recently become fashionable to advance the exhaust valve timing of 4 cylinder cars, which lets fire and high pressure out of the cylinder prematurely. This is fuck‚Äôn loud. On top of that, they are cutting out their catalytic inverters and removing the baffles inside their mufflers. 
These modifications actually refuse the performance of the engine and make them worse for racing. They are JUST loud and annoying. 
What we need to do is petition the city to put speed camera style ticketing poles in on key routs that activate at a certain decibel level after a specific time. In Snohomish County, that noise ordinance goes into effect at 9:00pm.

"Having just done that super fun house hunt myself, I completely understand. That is a hell I do not wish to revisit for as long as possible. 

I honestly thought you must have been there for a LOT longer than a month if you already got a commitment to remove the bench and shelter. 

If your neighbor has a fence, maybe you can push for an exemption based on that? You might want that fence no matter what happens to the bus stop. 

I think patience and persistence is going to be what it takes. Do look into a window tint too - a lot of them will actually help keep your house cooler in the summer too. That and there should be some landscaping tricks you can do. Maybe consult with a couple of companies and have them give you ideas. You don‚Äôt have to have them do all or any of the work, but their expertise could be exactly what you need. Both of these will make you feel better living there whether or not there is a bus stop.

The primary just happened as well, so you know who is competing for re-election/ election. Make a point to talk to those lawmakers because now is the time. The more neighbors you can involve, the better your chances of success.

You have learned something about yourself, and eventually you will move, and when you do you will end up moving to a house that isn‚Äôt anywhere near a bus stop or a heavily trafficked street. And when you do, you will get a locking mailbox as one of your first agenda items (speaking from experience).

Now, you did not explain any of the things you vaguely mention here. Did removing the bench help? 

It sounds like your best option (other than moving) is to recruit neighbors to your cause. And showing sympathy for the riders/ system users will help you make a compelling case to the city. Look for reasons as to why removing the stop would make the bus riding experience better for them. 

I would still start looking into what it would take to move and how you can build some quick sweat equity to make that happen. Or, if it really makes you crazy, maybe you can rent the house out and find a condo that you can rent to live in while you build up enough equity and savings to purchase another home. It would likely be a great rental property.",t2_7z9ay960,OutrageousVariation7,0,1628608472.0,0,t1_h8f2x38,h8f2x38,False,[deleted],t3_p1fngg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/p1fngg/how_do_i_get_a_bus_stop_removed/,How do I get a bus stop removed?,/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/p1fngg/how_do_i_get_a_bus_stop_removed/h8f2x38/,1,r/LynnwoodWA,0,1

"You knew about the bus stop when you bought the house, and it seems pretty selfish to think the ‚Äúbest option‚Äù is to have it removed. Is that the ‚Äúbest option‚Äù for the people who regularly use that bus stop? People who used that stop before you moved in?

I doubt you will get it removed, so modifications to YOUR lifestyle are in order. Your first option would be to sell the house and find one that is not by a bus stop. If that is not feasible for you then get a mailbox that locks, use a PO Box, put up the fence you can put up, put a mirror tent on your windows, etc. until it is a possibility.

You could also look into ways to make the bus stop not face your front door. Is there a way to reconfigure the seats or upgrade the shelter that would redirect attention from your house?

Ultimately, the chances of getting that stop removed are not great. You seem to be the only one upset by it, and there a greater number of people who rely on the stop than just one family. I imagine you haven‚Äôt got a cadre of neighbors to agree with you or you wouldn‚Äôt be posting here.",t2_7z9ay960,OutrageousVariation7,0,1628574991.0,0,t1_h8dp02f,h8dp02f,True,[deleted],t3_p1fngg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/p1fngg/how_do_i_get_a_bus_stop_removed/,How do I get a bus stop removed?,/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/p1fngg/how_do_i_get_a_bus_stop_removed/h8dp02f/,10,r/LynnwoodWA,0,10

"Spouse is a computer geek, and actually talked shop and compared notes with the cable technician/network engineer sent out to change us over to gigabyte speeds last year.

Our home network is a custom setup, and includes a couple of actual servers, and Ziply has been really chill and pleasant to work with. In fact, since we know what we‚Äôre doing and just want the speeds we pay for without needing tech help, we seem to be very happy with each other.

Frontier and Comcast both pitched fits about using their modems/entry points, and would always try to pull the ‚Äúpretty sure you‚Äôre tech illiterate and we know what‚Äôs actually happening‚Äù BS if we called about speed drops or network delivery issues. We‚Äôd also consistently get passive aggressive jabs about our own setup and how it being different from *their* preference might impede our services (because are we sure we know what we‚Äôre doing?). We haven‚Äôt gotten any of that with Ziply; their techs have even appreciated that my SO can give a partial network diagnosis over the phone and help them get right to the problem faster. 

They still feel like a smaller ISP (almost like Wave in downtown Seattle when we were down there), without the setup railroading Comcast/Frontier would always insist on. Not sure how long that will last, but we‚Äôre enjoying it while we can.

You might not get handholding/actual teaching if you‚Äôre not comfortable setting up your own router, but everyone we‚Äôve ever dealt with have been competent and professional.

"That is if they are arriving head to head at the same time which yes in that case the person taking a left yields the right of way to the person going straight. If they are arriving even slightly before though and even if taking a left will slow down the person going straight they have the right of way if they were there and stopped first. 

Also that RCW references if the approaching vehicle is in the intersection or close enough for immediate hazard. If they are on the other side of the intersection and still are stopping at the sign then that is not an immediate hazard as they need to stop while you are free to take a left as you have already stopped. You don‚Äôt need to sit there and yield if oncoming traffic hasn‚Äôt stopped yet. 

If that is what you were talking about, arriving head to head, then I misunderstood you. But stating must yield to oncoming traffic seems to imply a bit more than that

"> A beaver? That would be a new one!

Beavers are one of the reasons (if not the reason) it is a lake and not a creek. [This is a short snippet](https://wildliferecreation.org/projects/scriber-lake-park-trail-rehabilitation/) about the sorta recent $2M+ rehab of the lake. It mentions the beavers, of course.

[This is about everything you could ever want to know about it](https://www.lynnwoodwa.gov/files/sharedassets/public/public-works/project-folders/scriber-creek-trail-improvements/scriber-lake-park-master-plan.pdf). It goes back to the 1920's. I read it a couple times a year just for fun because I'm there so often.

Do not eat the fish. I got a 13"" trout there about 7 or 8 years ago. I was shocked because I hadn't seen anything about the state stocking it for a couple of years. I love to eat trout so I was stoked. That thing tasted exactly what you might imagine a goldfish from an old ill-maintained fish tank would taste like. Not only that, I learned later that it's a horribly polluted lake because of all of the runoff from 196th St. No amount of breading and deep frying can fix that taste and poison. Still not that bad for fishing if you like to catch and release small fish.",t2_89bad,I_Makes_tuff,0,1620795230.0,0,t1_gxtil3k,gxtil3k,False,Eruditerer,t3_na7ihf,https://www.reddit.com/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/na7ihf/bald_eagles/,Bald Eagles,/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/na7ihf/bald_eagles/gxtil3k/,2,r/LynnwoodWA,0,2

"We moved in to a neighborhood 1 mile north of 164 on Manor Way 4 years ago, and in the past 4 years we have not experienced any crime activity ourselves, or heard of any major incident in our immediate neighborhood. There were some porch pirate thefts, which I think is difficult to avoid just about anywhere, but that was about it.\\

The location of Manor off 164 in relation to surrounding businesses and convenience is great. The Alderwood shopping circle and restaurants in this area are continuously developing, and we're always finding gems.

The overall demographic on Manor Way seems to be shifting to younger people and new families. There are more and more developments happening on Manor Way, so I am optimistic that things will continue to improve.

That said, it's not all rainbows and unicorns:

* There are some houses, or congregates, or shared living houses that are very sketchy. I use the word sketchy because I don't know exactly what goes on in there, but there have been occasional police raids at night. It's concerning to me, but I haven't been personally impacted.
* Litters everywhere, shopping carts everywhere.
* That area of woods across from Fred Meyer hosts... people.

Do I regret buying a house in this area? No.

Do I feel safe walking on Manor Way by myself (mid 30's male)? 90% of the time.

Would I feel safe letting my kids play on the streets (off Manor) under my supervision? Yes.

Would I feel safe letting my kids ride their bike by themselves for 30 minutes? I probably wouldn't.

"We recently bought a home near Lake Stickney as well and we're stricken by some of the same concerns while buying. So far it's been quite good--we moved from a pretty suburban part of Bothell so I feel were doing a bit of pearl clutching initially but we have so far had nothing to complain about. Lots of young families and walking around the neighborhoods, lake stickney park is nice and feels safe.

That said we were initially a tad concerned seeing quite a few of unhoused congregate near where Airport rd and 99  meet but even that seems to have improved as this year has gone on, I'm not sure if there was a camp cleanup there recently. 

Living close to Alderwood has been great and it's nice to be close to mukilteo, mill creek, woodinville etc. I also am really over the moon with the food scene here lots of amazing, hole-in-the-wall like gems near by from all over the world.

With the light link inching towards northgate, then lynnwood hopefully in 2024 and then Ashway (god knows when?!) It seems like a good time to buy.

"Red onions (also known as purple onions in some European countries) are cultivars of the onion (Allium cepa), and have purplish-red skin and white flesh tinged with red. They are most commonly used in the culinary arts, but the skin of the red onion has also been used as a dye.These onions tend to be medium to large in size and have a sharp flavor and eye-watering qualities.

"Lots of people hit on positives, so I'll play the scrooge:

A. Traffic cameras. \*Only about 50% of these tickets are actually paid. Do your own research.

B. Those cameras and sales taxes pay for an abundance of patrol officers. You'll see them everywhere. Learn the traffic laws, and obey them to a T. They wait around corners, hungry for something to do.

C. Construction! Lots of noise and traffic inconvenience for the next three years as the lite rail station gets built, and the 'city' grows to accommodate it.

C. Homelessness problem is growing. Meth issue lingers. I've seen fewer meth heads in my corner of Lynnwood, but encountered someone shooting up in a park just a few days ago. Lots of this filters down from Everett.

"Best:

* subspace comics
* dawn's candy and cake supply
* muto izakaya (extremely bomb sushi and ramen)
* beard papa's cream puffs (inside of H-Mart)
* ichi teriyaki
* fade kingz 
* white rabbit cannabis 
* mukilteo dental center (technically in mukilteo)
* around the table game pub/store 
* gyro guys halal grill
* u lin asian bistro (excellent dim sum!!)
* precise shooter (if you like firearms) 
* nashville hot chicken
* olympus spa (haven't been since covid though, i dunno)
* oil change place by the gas station on 196th and whole foods (literally < 10 minutes in and out last time i was there)
* taqueria el rinconsito (holyyyyyy mole enchiladas)
* pho alderwood is pretty good, but not epic
* bobby's hawaiian
* special brews (absolutely incredible, rotating, imported and domestic selections)
* i like the korean place next to muto izakaya
* pochi bubble tea
* the gyro spot right next door to the game pub
* bluestone psychological services
* if AJ's beauty supply is back, they are excellent



Worst: 

* chinnie's chinese food on doordash 
* pretty much the majority of thai food around here
* the driver licensing office inside of Fred Meyer
* fireworks on sundays
* katsu burger (sorry i just can't do it)
* most of the pho around here, but I'd be glad to be corrected by someone
* shari's pies or whatever

"From the FAQ:



1.) Why are we working to recall Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney?


       
 A.) He has refused to enforce the ‚ÄúStay Home, Stay Healthy‚Äù mandate issued by Governor Inslee

        
B.) He has encouraged the public to defy the ‚ÄúStay Home, Stay Healthy‚Äù mandate

        
C.) He reinstated 3 deputies who were previously fired for cause, including killing an unarmed citizen, costing the taxpayers over $1M in restitution to the family. Two of the rehired deputies were found guilty of lying and can therefore not fulfill their duties to testify in court as a credible witness. Since being rehired, all 3 deputies have engaged in more unacceptable conduct:

   
D.) One lawsuit involved Fortney, Wallin, Boice and others for tasing and having a police dog bite a handcuffed man, 

  
E.) Another lawsuit involves Wallin violating the department's use-of-force policy by releasing a police dog on (and seriously injuring) a man without sufficient cause.



2.) Why were the deputies he reinstated fired?


       
 A.) Deputy Art Wallin was fired in October 2019 for shooting and killing an unarmed 24-year-old man. Taxpayers paid $1million to the family of the victim.

       
 B.) Deputies Boice and Twedt were fired for lying while on the job, and also for conducting an improper and illegal search (because they were fired for lying while serving as deputies they are not considered reliable witnesses in court).",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1612223085.0,0,t1_glo0xu8,glo0xu8,True,EverettLeftist,t3_la9gdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/la9gdi/lets_recall_sheriff_adam_fortney/,Let's Recall Sheriff Adam Fortney,/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/la9gdi/lets_recall_sheriff_adam_fortney/glo0xu8/,8,r/LynnwoodWA,0,8
