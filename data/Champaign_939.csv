"For outdoor activities, there are a ton of great options! I spend most of my weekends going hiking around the area. some of my favorites that are really close:

-	There are a lot of nice parks in town that can get you a few miles of walking in, and the town is generally oretty walkable if you live close to downtown and plan out your route. 
-	Allerton is great and really close
-	Buffalo Trace Prarie in Lake of the Woods rules
-	Forest Glen is really awesome and inly ~45 minutes away
-	The Charleston area has some fantastic trails (lake charleston loop, Warbler Ridge, and Fox Ridge)
-	Homer lake is only ~20 minutes away
-	Kickapoo rail trail is very nice (the portions that are done, of course!) and you can get from CU to St. Joseph on it without any driving.

"If you arrive in May, you will be happy you left Florida for the weather in Champaign in May, which is generally beautiful. You'll have five or six months before you have to prepare yourself for winter. You can always procrastinate. When it gets cold there will still be coats in the stores.

You can transition from your life as a college student and still enjoy the benefits of living in a university community. There are distinct business districts in downtown Urbana, downtown Champaign, and an area that the locals referred to as Campustown. At your age, you should be comfortable in all three locations for nightlife and restaurant meals.

There are nature places in the area, you should check out the University of Illinois owned Allerton Park about 20 miles west of Champaign. There are some city and county parks that are beautiful resources, both urban and out in the country.

If you really want to jump in to volunteer work, you might connect with the daily bread soup kitchen and help prepare meals for the needy which are served seven days a week completely supported by volunteers. There you would work side-by-side with everyone from age 18 to 88. It's a great way to engage in conversation with others in the community while doing something that should make you feel good about yourself. If you don't subscribe to the local newspaper, the News Gazette, you should at least start looking at it online from time to time. It's a better than average local newspaper at a time when many newspapers are going out of business. Reading about the local news will help you get a feel for the issues in the community.

You can also dip in on the website for the local CBS affiliate, WCIA TV Channel 3. That may or may not be useful, but watching a few local stories as presented by the local news, might give you a perspective on the community that you otherwise would not get if you stay in the insular university community.

"Champaign has changed quite a bit since then. Green Street is completely different now with high rise apartments and even a Target store on campus. There was a huge influx of students from China so there are lots of Chinese restaurants now compared to 2010.  There is now a Costco and Binny’s Liquor store at the north end of town on Prospect. Savoy is still far enough away that it relatively quiet.  I’d say the further south you go the more quiet it seems to be.  Again traffic in Champaign is usually non-existent unless there is a sporting event in town.  You can usually get anywhere in Champaign or Urbana in 15 -20 minutes max.

As far as family stuff I am sure there are day care options scattered around town, sorry but I don’t know any by name off the top of my head.  For activities, Curtis Orchard was always fun.

"First of all Champaign Urbana is really safe. Period. Are there problem areas? - yes. Avoid those. They are not hard to find. Second, this is not Madison or Ann Arbor or Lincoln or other similarly situated Big10 university towns. I have lived all over and in two years here, I can’t figure out why it is this way. The combination cities are an incredibly underperforming asset. How unified gov missed this place in the 60’s is beyond me.  So, at your age and disposition, if you want to be walkable to downtown (blind pig, seven saints, farrens, clark bar, watsons) I would suggest you look at the west side of downtown between/near church and university running west out to Eisner Park. Anywhere along there is pretty close to a walkable diverse affordable neighborhood. Super cute.  Hessel park area is also nice and walkable to the university. You are probably not going to casually shop here generally. You are two hours from Indy or a little more to Chicago. Everything in town is 15-20 minutes by car max. Not a big place. There is a mall and a Costco and affordable supermarkets and a great farmers market in Urbana on the weekends. Some people like Urbana a lot and I respect and love those hippies with their chickens and bee hives. Bless them all. But the developed areas of Urbana are few and most large houses have been welcomed into the cold embrace of college student ghetto housing. So agree with other post- expensive small apt or commune living with 12 undergrads under the same roof. Good luck and hope you decide to move here.

"I'm a feminist. A real one. Not a fucking terf.

Minstrel shows came about in the environment of Jim Crow. They were shows for the privileged, by the privileged. They relied on a list of racial steretypes intended to demean and dehumanize Black individuals. This happened in the aftermath of 400 years of American slavery, when Black people still faced the systemic oppression of Jim Crow and violent hate groups like the KKK. Minstrel shows were put on by white people (the powerful) to make fun of Black people (the oppressed).

Drag shows have been happening since basically the dawn of time, but drag as we know it today started in the 1930s. Gay men (an oppressed group, since we apparently have to keep tabs with you) started dressing as women as a form of self expression in gay clubs. Drag shows experienced a renaissance in the 1980s, during the AIDS crisis, which disproportionately affected queer and trans folks. During this time, drag became a point of pride, a way to show that despite the culture's disregard of queer people dying by the dozens, they were still here and proud of who they were. Drag was a radical act by the oppressed, a defiance of the gender roles that were forced upon them by the privileged majority.

My parents and my aunts didn't consciously realize that possibility as new parents until my cousins and I made them grapple with that reality. Thankfully I got fortunate with my middle and high school, thanks in part to conscious decisions.

I'm betting a number of gen X parents at that school are ""suddenly"" surprised that the school they're sending their kids to has that kind of environment.

Here is some info from Chicago if you have any plans to head up there:

""If you’re a tourist, it’s likely you’ll be hitting the city’s famed Michigan Avenue—part of which makes up the Magnificent Mile—anyway. In the Shops at North Bridge, look for Currency Exchange International, one of the city’s most reliable firms.

This exchange accepts coins and bills and guarantees to match, or even exceed, the rate offered by local banks on the same day and time. They are open Monday through Friday until 7 p.m. and closed on the weekends.4 If you’re coming by train (known in Chicago as the “L,” short for elevated) take the Red Line to the Grant Street station.

If you’re staying north of Chicago’s Loop in trendy Lincoln Park, the Clark Diversey Currency Exchange might be your best bet. Garnering excellent reviews for its consistently friendly and knowledgeable customer service, it also offers CTA transit cards. Clark Diversey is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on the weekends""",t2_3i68c482,old-uiuc-pictures,0,1632753012.0,0,t1_heh4fke,heh4fke,False,DarthFett,t3_psimsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Champaign/comments/psimsh/currency_exchange/,Currency Exchange?,/r/Champaign/comments/psimsh/currency_exchange/heh4fke/,2,r/Champaign,0,2

"I’ll just rank them in order for you, the ones you named at least. 

Paxton
Milford
Bement 
Rantoul

Of the towns you didn’t name but are good places to live:

St. Joseph
Mahomet
Gibson City
Watseka 

It also depends on where you’ll be working. I suspect your job will be in the Champaign area. Champaign-Urbana is still a good place to live. Pretty affordable for places in comparison to other university cities in other states. Okay schools, plethora of options for private/magnet schools. 

Of the towns you named, Paxton is the best. Nice town. Low crime. Decent food options. I think there is a grocery store, there’s a few restaurants and the schools are decent. 

Mahomet probably has the best or one of the best school districts in this area, but you pay for what you get. Taxes and housing prices are sky rocketing in that area. St. Joseph would be my next best, home prices are going up but it’s still pretty affordable depending on where you’re moving from. 

If you are going to be working in Champaign or Urbana, I still would suggest just moving to that area. Short commute, plenty to do, still affordable, and all though crime has gone up, it’s still a very safe place to live.

"You've listed some really small towns there.  Towns that make Rantoul (a small town) look big.  

- Rantoul: former air base town, so a lot of the economy tanked when that closed.  It's not all bad, but it is struggling. 
- The others: If rural is your thing, sure.  I don't know much in particular about them. Depending on the town, you may have to drive 30 minutes for groceries.  

If you do want to be a little more accessible to Champaign-Urbana, but still somewhat intimate with cornfields, try Ogden, St. Joe, Mahomet, Tolono.

"Meth related crimes, COVID non-believers, and general intolerance for differences will be the main problems in most smaller towns in East Central Illinois.  

Those towns have their own schools which bring in farm kids too. Looks like they do not go out to larger consolidated schools with adjoining towns. This could limit somewhat the offerings of these schools. 

The towns you have named are pretty far apart so I assume you are looking for some special features in a location and these have them.  

For instance north of Bement, which is a nice place, is Monticello which would offer a bit more in the way of school and activity options. 

A couple of guys from Paxton got arrested in the last year or so for domestic terrorism trying to blow some place up in Wisconsin or Minnesota - sorry do not recall the details. People I know here in Champaign/Urbana were kind of not surprised by them being from there as it has a history of being a sundown town. 

Rantoul used to have a major Air Force Base - closed 30 years ago or so I guess - They have some industries there and the town government keeps slowly improving things over time I guess. But the town struggles with poverty and some gang stuff which is happening in Champaign and Urbana too. 

Milford is kind in the middle of nowhere so it's probably just another nice small midwest farm town.

"Thanks for that comment. It is fascinating seeing this kind of stuff in the 21st century, truly. But you're exactly right, the disparities are in the socioeconomic status of many students attending Unit 4. The schools perform well, actually I believe Carey Busey (as well as Monticello schools) performed better than Mahomet in recent years. But Mahomet totes ""the best school systems in central Illinois"" because they pay their higher ups shit tons of money, so they have to bolster these claims to account for high pay rates. (Don't get me wrong, teachers should be getting paid shit tons. Higher ups are obviously getting most of the money though.) In reality, Mahomet performs about the same as Unit 4, like you said. But people don't want to send their kids to school with minorities and lower income students.

"My wife and I have lived together in Champaign for a while, and had a kid together in 2018.  In 2020 we decided to move house because ours was quite small and not a good fit for a kid. 

Of course when looking at new homes and neighborhoods, we took schools into account. I researched school ranking sites, statistics, demographics, and online discussions. What I found was kind of shocking, since I actually graduated high school in town and held a good opinion of the local schools. 

It was clear that there had obviously been a significant white flight since I graduated in 2001. More students than ever were attending private schools like St. Matthews, Judah, that Catholic school at the northwest edge of town, Academy High, Next Generation.  On top of the migration of some families to Mahomet or St. Joe. 

It didn't occur to me off the bat, although as an Asian person I always kind of had that sense of it. It was the result of constantly finding online discussions nebulously praising the school systems in these neighboring towns and deriding the local school system in Champaign (Urbana as well but I have no familiarity with their school system).  

I wondered why people seemed to think it was so bad here in town. Looking at the stats, the schools in town did indeed have lower average proficiency scores than Mahomet and St. Joe.  This was concerning to me, obviously, so I looked closer.

Further digging revealed that white students in Unit 4 Champaign schools were doing just as well or better than their peers in neighboring communities. Equivalent college entrance exam scores, better college attendance rates.  For black students, they were doing worse on average locally than their white or asian peers, although on par with or slightly better than the state average. The much higher proportion of poorly performing students accounted for the difference in achievement gaps between the communities.  

Sadly, there weren't even enough black or minority students in Mahomet or St. Joe to make a comparison.  St. Joe appeared literally to have fewer than 10 black students in the entire system (and I happened to know the parents of 2 of them). Asian and Hispanic students, I couldn't find enough data since the numbers were also incredibly small.  The number of students receiving free or reduced lunch was also about 4x higher in Unit 4 compared to Mahomet.

So the unit 4 schools were doing worse by comparison, but their primary failing was poor and black students.  I also found that between 2000 and 2010, Unit 4 underwent several changes to its enrollment procedures, in efforts to create more equitable schools across its system.  Elementary schools went from a system where children almost always went to their closest school, to a system based both on distance and on a ranked choice system modified by a computer-determined algorithm which took into account socioeconomic status.  

The current system involves families having priority enrollment at schools within 1.4 miles (door-to-door), in combination with the controlled-choice system.  The data I could find was that parents got their first choice 85-90% of the time, and one of their top five 95-99% of the time.  Seemed pretty decent.  However, the institution of the controlled choice strategy coincided heavily with the white flight to private, religious, and neighboring school systems. It's both surprising and not.  Surprising because of how little the controlled choice system actually affected families, and not because, you know, fear and racism.

I'm not sure where I'm going with this.  Wealth and race still have significant effects on educational achievement America.  Unit 4 is trying, but struggling.  Some scared parents are rushing to send their children elsewhere, but actually not having any better success other than creating more segregation.  Asian parents aren't fleeing to these surrounding communities, but the wealthier ones are certainly sending more of their kids to private schools in the area, and that is doubly true for wealthy white parents and private/religious schools.

Suffice it to say, I decided strongly *against* moving to Mahomet or elsewhere, and that I would be comfortable sending my kid to the schools available here.  The data seems to support the conclusion that all the ""successful"" students of the surrounding towns would be just as successful here.

"A little more detail would help: address or ( if you arent comfortable with that) at least a rough cross street. Knowing something like 6 or 7 hundred block would be helpful, esp. since Green is a major street.

Without more info anything on either Green or Delaware is probably not going to be in a bad neighborhood. Delaware is a bit student but fine near Lincoln, gets pretty upscale as you move East, and gets a bit more downmarket as you cross Vine and head east. I dont know the neighborhoods if you are really far east urbana.

Green is similar, it gets nicer as you move away from campus, and then turns around and gets a bit more downmarket.

"Gotcha. I'll have to go back to GH sometime. I agree, the fact that they have a massive menu is impressive and maybe the biggest thing they've got going. And they ARE Chinese owned, which is why I'm willing to think maybe I just ordered the not as good dishes the one time I went and they can do better. 

I might be getting the menus mixed up since I use chowbus to order and maybe that is why I remember everything being in English. This could be a fault of my own memory. That being said, if you want to order food from the local authentic Chinese restaurants, use the app! They reliably translate EVERYTHING to English, and many have pictures too, so you can get a clear idea of what you're ordering. Chowbus makes it very easy to order from all the local asian dessert and restaurants and the delivery ppl work very hard. (Please tip!)

Crazy! I'm an aggie too! And from Sf bay area so you KNOW we picky about our food ;) damn we have been looking for new friends here from CA. Everyone we have met in chambana so far.... has been from other places where I feel like they have been less exploratitive with food. Someone here from Texas  even asked us what poke was and then proceeded to spit out the tuna we ordered for them because they were shocked it was raw and thought the tuna would be canned.... 🤦‍♀️

Anyways, that's a tangent. Glad to meet a fellow aggie here. My bf and I both went there for undergrad.

I think international market is the best asian grocery we have in town. I love it and their bakery has very cheap but affordable asian pastries, it's awesome. Obviously the groceries we used to go to in South bay (h mart, ranch 99, marina) are huge in comparison but Intl has all the key components we need. 

Glad to chat all day with you about local asian eats and in Chicago too.

"So, GH has 3-5 different menus, depending on how you count (or had, I have only ordered pickup in the past few years). ""Americanized Chinese"" (lol forget that general chicken bs), ""Tradtional Chinese"" (or maybe it's called ""authentic""?) - this one has a few hundred items, and has English and Chinese. Some of the English is very terse/non-descriptive. And a ""Chinese Menu"" that has no English. It has some 20-30% more items, but I'm just a white guy who likes Chinese food and culture but doesn't read it. Unfortunately, I've never had the pleasure of dining there with a friend who reads Chinese (they are all elsewhere). So I'm not really sure what all they are ""hiding"" from non-readers like me :)  


Plus there's a big board of specials, and also seasonal specials, many of which don't seem to be translated to English, but some are. Anyway, part of why I consider it best overall is that the menu(s) are so huge, none of the other places in town (when I first tried GH over 10 years ago) had anything  close to that variety of several different regional flavors etc.   


So GH may warrant another try with different selections, but then again now that I think of it, maybe it used to be better years ago? My main impression was formed back when it was the first place in town I tried that could stand on par with a decent restaurant in SF (I did grad school in Davis, and SF was my first experience with that caliber of Chinese food). And then I stopped paying attention to new places (also moved away for a while and came back, etc)  


But I do love Chinese cooking and am getting better at making (at least what I like) at home. In that vein, what do you think of Fresh International Market? I've been to several other Chinese grocers, but never one so big, and with such reliably good fresh produce.

"I'm confused. The entire menu at GH is In English and Chinese...

At least the last time I ordered there. 

Yes, they have authentic Chinese dishes as part of the menu. I just don't think taste wise they're actually done fully well or authentic, or at least the ones I ordered. Then again, I ate there only once and just wasn't impressed and never went back. I ordered like 10 dishes from them and already had tried places like midsummer by then and decided from those 10 dishes that GH just wasn't up to my standard.

"Not true. As an actual Chinese person, golden harbor is meh at best and caters to the American white crowd too much in taste for me to say it's ""the best"". If you want truly amazing Chinese food, and authentic, there are a million good places in town. Uiuc is a Hotspot for Chinese students after all. Try mid summer lounge (noodle house), new yu yuan (shanghainese), shi Quan (amazing southern cuisine and dumplings), and Nanjing bistro to start.

For desserts, suzu is amazing for Japanese desserts, meet fresh is amazing for Taiwanese desserts (and a major chain too), and moments bakery is a special hidden gem that you can use Wechat to order from.

Also golden harbor is very cheap. Especially in comparison to the ones I listed, I have to say. Then again I order delivery via Chowbus app so my prices are all inflated.

"Hi. Since you've said that I might provide the following info. This may or may not be useful as I haven't visited since May 2 and May 5 (respectively), but the DD on Springfield (I think at Country Fair cross street in Champaign, or at most not more than one block away from that location) and the Starbucks (at Springfield and Mattis in Champaign) both had ""help wanted"" signs on the door as we drove through. May or may not be worth a call since this info is old.  I'll pay attention as things open and post another reply, but also, I'm still Covid-Cautious so don't go out much except drive-thru and trunk=delivery places.

Hope something works out. I think you'll like Urbana-Champaign if you get to know it.

"Well, since you are not yet a student I am not certain what you mean by 'work' off campus. A job? Or a place to study, etc. If not a job, some favorite places are the Urbana Free Library, the Lakehouse (at Urbana's Crystal Lake Park (but no internet, though that may not be important until school begins), Kafe Kopi and Aroma Cafe in downtown Champaign, probably several other coffee houses in town (including Espresso Royale in Urbana near Krannert and Cafe Paradiso on Lincoln, and Flying Monkey in Urbana).  Also the Kaldi in Savoy at Harvest Market. Some people like the coffee house in the County Market on Springfield Ave in campus town. 

I'm less useful if you want jobs. I know SEA Group is looking for people (it's a consulting firm that mostly hires PhD's and doctoral students with expertise in stats, math models, and social science), plus Yahoo and a couple other local tech jobs also are looking for applicants. On the other end, a lot of local restaurants, whether local or chain, are looking for people as they open up as Covid slows. 

As to places to work out (as opposed to work), have you looked into whether or not you can use the ones on campus such as ARC and CRCE? Since you are not yet a student you probably will have to pay a fee, but it probably isn't much, maybe not even as much as faculty and townies have to pay. Plus, almost all of them are nearly empty in the summer (when about 45000 of our 50000 students leave). Not sure if all are open during Covid, but some are.   Also, cheap, but not really recommended, are the various Planet Fitness places in town. They tend to be OK until you wish to cancel.  Also, there are tons of jogging trails and even ""fitness paths"" in this town.

"Most of what we have is cornfields. Busey Woods, weaver park, Barnhart prairie reserve, and the prairie trails at meadowbrook are all great parks but don’t allow dogs on the trails. Meadowbrook has a lot of other trails that do allow dogs but there’s a looooot of dogs usually walking there. Colbert park in savoy has an open field behind the sledding hill where people usually don’t walk their dogs. Lots of mouse holes my pup loves to sniff. North west champaign has a couple parks I don’t know much about that might be good. I’ve heard a lot of good things about the dog park on the west side of town.

Allerton park is about half an hour away and has nice forest trails. The lost garden section of the park over the river from the main buildings is less traveled. People do walk there dogs off leash there sometimes (not allowed) but are usually go about stopping and putting them on a leash when passing other dogs. 

If you go further to Decatur (an hour), rock springs is a really nice park with a couple prairie trails and forest trails that are less used. Rarely met anyone out there when training my pup which was so helpful. Macon county up keeps their parks super well. Also in Decatur is sand creek. It’s horse trails and has a lot of creeks that cross the trails without bridges. Most times I’ve been I haven’t met anyone else for miles. Wide paths and the inner loop doesn’t cross any of the creeks. 

Feel free to pm me if you have more questions! I grew I grew up here and also have a dog who’s “dog reactive”.

"Champaign is a very diverse city - I don't think you would have a problem at all fitting in or finding work, especially in the service industry. There are a million restaurants and bars in town that will probably be looking for more employees once restrictions lift, which seems to be right around the corner. It's a little more expensive to live here (or it was for me when I was young and poor) because of all the college students driving up prices, but there are affordable apartments to rent if you look. (Hint: Urbana is generally cheaper and the bus system is great, so you can get virtually anywhere in both cities pretty easily) 

I don't feel like I can speak to racial issues (I'm white) but there are students from all over the world who come to the U of I and both cities are culturally diverse. Could it be better? Of course. But I think Champaign/Urbana is a unique microcosm of international and American culture, especially for the Midwest. Just my two cents.

"I second the farmer's market as the best place to find a variety of local vendors. As far as I can think, there aren't many 'craft' shops that would sell things you're looking for. There are a few art galleries (Cinema Gallery, The Gilbert Gallery) that sell fine art, although I'm not sure of their prices or availability during the pandemic.

The best bet would be some local cafes and other shops that sometimes sell local goods. The only ones I can think of are Art Mart (home goods and a cafe), Hopscotch Bakery, Checkered Moon, Plant Mode (highly recommend if you want a new plant friend or locally made planter), Enchantment Alley, and Bohemia. I can't attest to any of their availabilities because of the pandemic, but they're all googleable. 

I don't think there are really any cool 'neighborhoods' like a larger city would have, unless you count Campustown as its own neighborhood. It's fun to go drink when the students are gone, but then again, pandemic. 

All else fails, I'm a local oil painter and I know several other local artists. One of us would be happy to sell to you. ;)

"Honestly the best place that I can think of is at the farmers market on Saturday mornings by Common Ground food co-op. 

There is a potter there that I love! My partner and I have multiple pieces from him and they're great and practical. He sells mugs, fruit bowls, piggy banks, etc. 

Also there is a soap maker that is there as well, The Wright Soap, and her stuff is fantastic.

As far as galleries go, I think most of them have been closed due to the pandemic? There used to be one by Sipyard, but I don't think they're open. 

Oh and there's also an art thing on the second floor of Enchantment Alley, which is still open! They have all kinds of art there. 3D stuff, books, 2D art, posters, etc. all from local artists.

"Hi. It sounds like your boyfriend must be a student on campus. Even though CU is home to the UI, there is a ton more going on here. In fact, if you don't live in student areas you almost don't even notice the campus except when it is causing traffic jams, etc.  So, that said, look outside of the student areas and student activities.  Here are some suggestions, some possibly obvious and many possibly of no interest, but there are many things you may be interested in doing here.

* Church activities. I'd say avoid the fanatically religious groups, but many of the mainline churches have tons to do where they almost never talk about religion. (TBT, I go to church because of my SO, but I am active because I really like doing things with some of its members.)  Food banks, gaming groups, hiking and environmental groups, scouting/youth groups may need adult leaders, and so much more.  I've made some good friends this way, and if you promise not to tell my SO, I  say that I don't really care much about the religion.
* Civic organizations. Things like the Chamber and Rotary to neighborhood improvement groups all look for new members, and almost all are pretty informal where you won't be spending time in meetings but rather doing activities with others where you can do things and talk with them, etc.
* The **Champaign or Urbana Parks** groups. Both need a lot of volunteers. In summers there are kid-related things you can help with. Not my bag, but many like it. You can teach arts, camping, nature, crafts, etc. More important to me are adult activities.  I guess here I should mention that both have tons of adult ed options where you might make friends or at least meet people (and these range from archery to cooking to crafts to yoga and other things) but I'm really thinking more of the various volunteer activities. Almost every week I ""work"" for 3 hours with the CPD in their prairies and woods and  3 more hours each week in UPD natural areas. I've made some great friends that way, it keeps me outside and getting some exercise (albeit pretty minimal) and sunshine. We spend time removing invasive plants from the prairies and woodlands, we gather seeds in the fall for planting in the spring, we plant native forbs in the woods, and we have occasional parties and get together meals. Plus, they will help you to learn about natives versus invasives, etc. Very low pressure, and a very sociable experience if you want it to be.
* Join the **Allerton Allies** group. Once a month (sometimes more) they get together to do things at the beautiful Allerton Park in Monticello.  Granted, not CU per se, but not really far. The group begins the day with munchies, chatting, and getting to know newer members, then it goes out into the woods or prairie or other parts of the park to do things to improve the park. They too remove invasives or plant new native plants. They clear trails. They put up signs and lights for people visiting the park. All kinds of stuff. After about four hours of ""work"" (where, frankly, a lot of the time is spent visiting with others), they go out to lunch together. I find it to be great fun.
* Depending upon your interests, you might consider becoming a **Master Gardener** or **Master Naturalist**. These involve several months of (once per week) classes where you learn a lot about our area and also get to meet a lot of people with similar interests, and also ask you to do volunteer work in gardens or natural areas with both a subset of your classmates as well as prior graduates of the programs.
* UIUC has a ton of things for townies. Evening classes through departments, extension, and their adult education outreach programs have tons of offerings. While these are courses, and right now they mostly are Zoom courses, it is a fine place to meet others who may have similar interests. 
* Off campus has lots of clubs in which you can engage. Running groups, biking groups, hiking groups, stained glass groups, crochet groups, knitting groups, parent groups, gardening groups, even groups that plan trips to Chicago, Indy, St. Louis, Nashville, and other places where they eat and go shopping. I am in a townie photography group and pottery group, but there are tons to choose from.
* Read **Smile Politely** and **Chambana Moms**, which are online. Both often list things to do that may be of interest. For that matter, although I find it much less informative about what is going on here (and having a strong political bias), the News-Gazette often lists things to do in CU even though it is no longer locally owned or operated.
* The Champaign County Forest Preserve District also has lots of offerings. The nearest forest preserve is the Lake of the Woods in Mahomet, but there are several other locations. They offer things to do ranging from classes, volunteer activities, day trips, golf, tennis, a clear skies park that sometimes has group activities to show you planets, comets, etc. 
* Some things most people think of as shops need help because they really are volunteer run. The **Idea Store** in Lincoln Square is a volunteer run shop that provides items to teachers; it always needs help, and it is entirely non-profit.  I guess in that same vein (though different) are some of the resale shops like Goodwill, who often look for help. While these may sound like work, they also have a strong social side where you get to know your fellow volunteers. Similarly, the **Common Ground Food-Coop** in Lincoln Square often needs helpers. If cooking is  your thing, you might look into **The Red Herring** (a small, non-profit, vegan restaurant on the Urbana side of campus).
* **Krannert Center for the Performing Arts** always needs volunteer ushers, ticket takers, etc. One nice thing here is that in addition to getting to know some other among the volunteers you also get to see all kinds of performances (for free) that range from rock and roll groups, classical music, jazz music, plays of all kinds, and vocal arts (poetry, etc.). 

Some (but by no means all) of the above things have slowed down during our Covid crisis, but many already are starting to pick back up.  I can probably come up with more, but for now, without knowing your interests, I'll hope that this gives a decent idea of some things that will help integrate you into town and put you in contact with others who may have similar interests. Check in the libraries and park districts for things to do in the community. Check on reddit and Chambanamoms and Smile Politely. Check at local churches which, while obviously advertising their own activities also list tons of things to do in this town. Although they are starting to die off, sometimes the bulletin boards in restaurants and parks and stores will have fliers about groups or about some activity that may be of interest.

In sincerely hope this helps. It can be a crappy place if you don't have things to do and don't have friends. But most people here tend to be pretty open to meeting new people regardless of what they do. Townies and Gownies tend to get along... well, some don't like the undergrads, but grad students and the families of U folk don't face much prejudice.",t2_98fyy,urbanaprof,0,1597948993.0,0,t1_g28oudz,g28oudz,True,[deleted],t3_iala0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Champaign/comments/iala0t/hey_psst_pssssst/,Hey psst pssssst,/r/Champaign/comments/iala0t/hey_psst_pssssst/g28oudz/,2,r/Champaign,0,2

"Hah. Makes sense. I’ve done a lot of theater in a town near here with 1100 people and no stores, one bar, one gas station, and no stop lights lol. It was kind of my second home growing up since I was there 5 days a week for about a decade.

I suggest tryna to meet someone up for a walk at Meadowbrook Park or even checking it out on your own. There’s a beautiful pathway with options of 1-3 miles. Less overwhelming since less people around. There’s conservation prairie land in it and art/statues that are fun to look at.

"Oh goodness! I use to be allergic to cats as well and have asthma. Well I still have asthma but it's not as bad as it use to be. I come from a very tiny town in the middle of nowhere, when I say tiny I mean tiny. There is only one stoplight, and about 5 stores haha. So moving here was a shock, I'm afraid to venture off on my own because of it and I'm a bit of a shy person so that definitely doesn't help. I've been on campus, it's neat, never seen something like it. Might sound weird to say that since it's a normal place haha. 

I've played gta online, it was fun at first gets a little boring if you're not playing with others. I like bethesda as well, my favorite game of theirs is wolfenstein the new order. I've only played fallout 4, I enjoyed it, might reply it because I run through things when I play games sometimes. I didn't really explore much.

"Welcome! 

I’m from town, lived in over a dozen places in town between Champaign/Urbana. Gamer, homebody, audio engineer and music producer.
You’re right - the social scene that’s easiest to see and join is the drinking one. To find the others you really gotta look or happen across someone who invites you / shares interests.

If you have questions, I would help with whatever info I can. I’ve worked at restaurants in this town for about 12 years and often help new people w stuff to find and do.

The other poster is right though, there’s a lot more to this town and area than meets the eye. I like to think it’s the best of the small town and big city - pretty much anything you need available in most locations at most times, fairly low traffic, relatively safe (has been changing in past decade or two as it expands but still not bad for a campus of normally 70k+ students and staff). The campus is kind of its own little city that the town circles around (traffic is the worst there/lots of one-way streets/kids not paying attention to traffic), but living here for 29 years has shown me that the rapid expansion of campus, the surrounding area, and the growing number of local business start ups may create overlapping lines eventually, if not soon.

Cheers,
-G

P.S. (Games) Mostly playing GTA 5 online right now as I’ve drastically reduced my game-time to focus on starting my audio business. I got into gaming with Starcraft, Diablo, Counterstrike and World of Warcraft. Elderscrolls and Fallout have my heart (really, Bethesda games in general). Dark Souls has my ... soul(?). I like the game. A lot.

P.P.S. Cats are awesome and I grew up with them (7+ cats in my child hood). It wasn’t until i moved out of home that I found out I was allergic the whole time. Had been taking two allergy medications daily for about 6 years. Haven’t needed it since I moved out. *sigh
I just grew out of asthma after 16 years so maybe that will change too 🤞


Oh yeah - and in the past couple years, we lost nearly all good regular dance venues and the music scene also has taken some interesting ups n downs. However - whenever things open back up, I think we will see quite the revival of that stuff due to momentum that was surging pre-covid. I’d say this situation screwed us, but I think once people feel safe to get out again, they will crave being social after being isolated from each other",t2_4go7tcv6,HumblyG,0,1597595575.0,0,t1_g1qxuw9,g1qxuw9,True,[deleted],t3_iala0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Champaign/comments/iala0t/hey_psst_pssssst/,Hey psst pssssst,/r/Champaign/comments/iala0t/hey_psst_pssssst/g1qxuw9/,4,r/Champaign,0,4

"Are those people dog trainers? If so, I take it back, but even dog trainers have a hard time. My point is, no matter how well intentioned, there's a high likelyhood that most people you talked to would have eventually surrendered her because if she's failing a friendliness test, she would likely need weekly/bi-weekly sessions with a dog trainer and approximately 10-15 hours a week of dedicated training to help her.

They reassure people that dogs won't get euthanized precisely because the public gets so up in arms about euthanasia of un-adoptable dogs. Like I said, I think you are underestimating the effort needed to keep a dog with these kinds of issues so your recommendation for everyone to stop surrendering dogs to animal control is dangerous for the dogs, other dogs, other animals, and other people. If you, on a personal level, have the backyard space, money, and time to spend on training them, by all means, keep the dog. But unless you know what you're getting into, it is far better to surrender. You are claiming that they should have done things differently when this is what most (nearly all) county shelters would do.

My initial point and what I stand by is that unless you have spent a length of time volunteering or working at county shelters or have educated yourself thoroughly on shelter issues and shelter medicine, you should not be condemning protocols put in place for the shelter to give the best shot to the highest number of animals possible.",t2_qm36e,joanholmes,0,1592930296.0,0,t1_fvrb20l,fvrb20l,False,LazyBriefcase,t3_he6j0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Champaign/comments/he6j0t/dont_take_stray_animals_to_the_champaign_county/,"Don't take stray animals to the Champaign county animal control shelter and if you do, expect them to be euthanized.",/r/Champaign/comments/he6j0t/dont_take_stray_animals_to_the_champaign_county/fvrb20l/,3,r/Champaign,0,3

"I would highly suggest you spend some time volunteering/educating yourself on shelters before demonizing animal control for having the protocols they need in place.

No-kill shelters are 1. often worse for the animals and 2. need to be very stringent with what animals they take in *because* they can't euthanize. I would be veery surprised if any no-kill shelter ever took a dog that failed a friendliness test.

You say that there are plenty of people that would take an aggressive dog and train them but thats simply not true. It is immensely difficult to train a dog like that unless you have loads of knowledge and time. Most people will adopt one thinking they can handle it and then just take it back when it doesn't work out. And the shelter has to take them back every time. She would be taking up kennel space that could be used for an adoptable dog. Whether you like it or not, it's unlikely a reactive dog would get adopted and kept.

You said you didn't have space for a dog but also that you would have taken the dog. If you can take the dog in, take it in. By all means, you do the de worming and all the shots. Feel free to use any low-cost or free programs available to spay and chip her. But don't blame animal control when they have to make decisions based on the very very limited resources they have. And don't go around badmouthing county shelters because they have to make this choices.

"Housing market is weird right now due to COVID. CU is heavily based on the university, and therefore employment and wages haven’t been hit as hard here compared to many other areas.  CU has the lowest unemployment of any of the other small cities around (Bloomington, Springfield, Decatur, Peoria, etc). So combine that relatively strong economy with super low interest rates and maybe a relative shortage of homes on the market...

When I was looking at houses in early May, many homes in my budget (180-230k) were being offered on extremely quickly, and some homes in that price range were getting multiple offers in the first few days.  Sometimes we took our time after viewing to decide on if we wanted to offer, and the house would be pending the very next day.

My realtor suggested we make an offer above list on a home we really liked, since there were a couple other offers likely incoming. That’s how we got our offer accepted. I’ve talked to a few bankers who said they almost can’t keep up with the number of new home purchase mortgage applications

Your realtor might be able to tell you what homes are likely to go quickly when you view them, which should give you an idea on how strong you may want to make your offer. If you are local and know the area well enough, you probably have a sense for that as well. Your realtor might also know through connections how many other people are viewing a given house.

If you’ve only offered on two homes so far, it’s probably just a combination of the strange market and bad luck.",t2_bqn9t,MaiPhet,0,1591713433.0,0,t1_ftha4vw,ftha4vw,True,[deleted],t3_guz8w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Champaign/comments/guz8w1/house_hunting_advice/,House Hunting Advice,/r/Champaign/comments/guz8w1/house_hunting_advice/ftha4vw/,1,r/Champaign,0,1

"People wait outside in lines for breakfasts at “Le Peeps” and “Original House of Pancakes” (OHOP). I once was a lead cook for several years at a fancy hotel and I’ve never eaten a breakfast item that I couldn’t prepare a better version of myself from my home save for a single lone exception; OHOPs pancakes.  I have no idea what their secret is but the base pancakes they make (as in the batter cake only, before any bells and whistle toppings) are outside my understanding.  It will feel like you are experiencing a real pancake for the first time and everything before it was a cheap imitation.

The restaurant selection here is insanely diverse especially compared to most towns in the Midwest and Is definitely a highlight.  The university here is very diverse  with international students who have created a demand for high quality and often very authentic Japanese, Thai, Korean, and Sushi restaurants.  There are many other non-Asian treasures around as well and arguably the best Chicago style deep dish pizza place in a Illinois outside of the greater Chicago area in my opinion.  There are many other exceptional recommendations I would have as well that are hidden gems including some dive bars, food trucks, and 2 different international import grocery stores that also serve Food Network worthy dishes.

There is a university downtown area as well as two regular downtown areas that are each unique to the others.  Although I don’t frequently go out drinking at my ripe age of 29; the age groups, crowdedness, expenses of each location is nice to be able to pick from based on who I’m with and what kind of social experience we desire on a given night.

There is quite a bit to do here despite it being a large town rather than a city.  There are non franchises boutiques, music shows (canopy club is an exceptional intimate venue and mainstream artists play in the stadiums), Big 10 school sporting events; escape rooms, parks (one of the dog parks is exceptional), meetups for pickup sports posted and online, cafes, a pretty dope library, plenty of beautiful strangers to meet and talk to, fun volunteering opportunities, a climbing gym, many house parties in certain areas, board game enthusiast clubs, decently active online dating populations, art galleries that rotate exhibits, a decent enough mall, and more.  It’s a bit different at the moment though with the pandemic obviously.

I’ve lived in Seattle, Phoenix, Austin and spent time in Chicago and this is the only non-city I’ve ever felt that doesn’t feel too boring/small/removed/uncultured.  It’s a decently good looking town too and it is full of diverse personalities and diverse people of different backgrounds.  I took a job here permanently a few months back as an analytical laboratory chemist and have recently begun looking for a house to buy so I can settle down here.  I’m pretty happy with what I’ve found here and would recommend it to those who have enjoyed living/staying in cities but have new needs that make city life difficult like starting a family or buying a home or avoiding higher costs of living (I pay much less for rent now then ever yet have a nicer and larger place then ever).

Like others have said, the water is exceptional and I constantly refill water bottles and place them back in the refrigerator and experience no preference between my opened and unopened bottles.  I did not feel the same about water in other towns I’ve lived in.

I highly recommend this town.  If you move here feel free to reach out to me to hang out.  I love meeting random new people and i don’t find it uncomfortable reaching out to a stranger who just found them self in a new place.  I know it might be tough to move and make friends considering the current status of this our state and country, especially if it’s just you or you and an SO.

Good luck with your decision, hope my life post was useful.  It helped me kill time at work ;-)",t2_58i96555,koala_encephalopathy,0,1588441988.0,0,t1_fpa6twr,fpa6twr,True,[deleted],t3_fydng8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Champaign/comments/fydng8/possibly_moving_to_champaign/,Possibly moving to Champaign,/r/Champaign/comments/fydng8/possibly_moving_to_champaign/fpa6twr/,1,r/Champaign,0,1

"I lived in Charleston for a year and moved back to Champaign because of my family and friends all live in the Champaign area.  You can see movies, eat at decent places, and have decent shopping in Charleston/Mattoon, but it’s so much more diverse and richer in Champaign/Urbana.  Much better restaurants, entertainment, shopping etc.  

I compare the situation to Texas pretty often.  Champaign/Urbana is the Austin of downstate, Illinois.  Everything else is like regular rural Texas.  

It is cheaper to live in Charleston/Mattoon or Tuscola, but I wouldn’t recommend buying a house unless you plan on staying for a long while.  Real Estate prices in the more rural areas are deflated.  Real Estate prices in Champaign are a lot higher, but there is more demand.  

The biggest weather obstacle I have with the commute is wind.  The wind blows out of the southwest a lot and can gust around Tuscola/Arcola area.  The winters are pretty mild and snow doesn’t seem to last more than 2-3 days before it melts.

"The restaurants in Mattoon are a bit grim. There is a Thai place as well as 1 in Charleston. For sushi there is a hibachi place, but they might go out of business at any moment. Champaign is the best restaurant place in Central Illinois.

Hunting is very popular in this area. Mattoon or Champaign has tons of options. I'm not a hunter, but I've known many.

Mattoon is walkable, but most everything in town is built for driving over walking. Champaign is much better there.

The commute is easy. It's all interstate and well plowed. It's rarely blocked in the winter.

Near Mattoon, you'd probably be better in Mattoon. Charleston is a shrinking and the other places are tiny.

As far as Tuscola, it's small and isn't any better for walking than Mattoon. It sounds like you might prefer Champaign. The commute isn't too bad. I still make it often but not daily.

I hope that helps. Feel free to ask more.

"We'd be interested in buying a house over renting and the options in Tuscola look a bit grim. Is there any hope there?

How walkable is mattoon? Within 2 - 5 miles we can walk down to a coffee shop right now and enjoy being able to so that with our dog. 

Whats the restaurant scene like in Mattoon? Any good sushi? We cook a lot but have a weakness for sushi and Thai.
