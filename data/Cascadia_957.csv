"Here’s my idea, completely subjective and very half-baked but at least it’s something:

We have voting pools based on vocation. We can call them Unions or Collectives or something, but basically you and your fellow workers join together and vote on legislation and a representative who goes to a higher Senate to create the legislation the lower Unions vote on. Unemployed/Retired or Military personnel vote in their own pools that are less regulated for the previous and more regulated for the latter. Every 5 years the whole nation votes on a Triumvirate of executives who serve for only one term and are pretty much what the US president but split into three people.

It's culturally, geologically, environmentally, and even economically distinct from the rest of North America. It has much stronger trade ties with Asia and as such should be able to sustain itself independently paired with, hopefully, a sustainable resource economy.

"I don't know the movement very well because there isn't a single idea behind it, but some people talk about bioregionalism, which is basically the idea of the governments and businesses coordinating in order to best utilize the resources of the area without harming it - a sort of refocusing of the regions economy to make it sustainable and of peak efficiency and environmental friendliness. 

There are others, separatists, who have varying degrees of desire for a separate entity. 

Personally, I'm a Confederalist who believes the best path forward for the US is a number of regional governments replacing states and taking on much of the power/responsibility of the federal government, while the Federal government retains a weakened Supreme Court, Congress, Presidency and the military, but without the expansions of federal power that have occurred in the last 70 years. The way I see this happening is through regional separatist movements, states' rights activists and third party working together to push a constitutional convention to create a new map of the country. It's the only way that we would avoid either A). Starting an armed conflict or B). Giving the rest of the country to a particular political party as waves of states' attempt to secede. Afterwards, Western Canada would be more willing to secede from Canada and join the union and in that case, British Colombia's portion of Cascadia could merge with the US' portion. It would take many decades of effort and attempting to create a 3rd party operating at the state levels formed from the DSA, Greens, Libertarians, Constitution Party, Black Panthers, non-voters, Nation of Islam,  White Nationalists etc... who all want to work less with one another. 

So effectively, change the US from being structured

Federal>State>Local to Federal>Regional(>maybe State)>Local.

Canada also has the population of a US state or two, making it more akin to West Virginia and Virginia splitting up than Washington and Oregon splitting away from The USA. There's also not a very large secessionist movement in Cascading right now. It's relatively large, but it isn't popularly supported. Then you have to factor in the political landscape. Western Canada is very conservative. The Northwestern US is very progressive. Western Canada and the PNW only discuss things like this in the context of Vancouver/BC splitting from the rest of their region, but the real Western Canadian independence movement is led by like...Alberta. You're effectively talking about Moderate Conservatives and Far Leftists aligning to remove the means by which they cooperate with...Moderate Leftists and Far Right Conservatives respectively in favor of working with each other. Then there's the White Nationalists to worry about. American white nationalists have picked that region as one of the three in which they are considering establishing a homeland. That region has a disproportionate number of Asian-Americans and LGBT individuals. The first region to secede will attract any community with a strong secessionist identity if it has a low enough population. 

The only way that a progressive secessionist movement will work is if we simultaneously prop up the conservatives. More ideally is we work to push the US to becoming a Confederation with provinces more like Canada's in size and more independent than either and then we push Canada to join the US. The PNW can move towards unification and have virtual autonomy except in international affairs. This preserves our security from both external and internal enemies.",t2_1lf6zu76,Alxndr-NVM-ii,0,1647605729.0,0,t1_i156qmj,i156qmj,True,mpdmax82,t3_tgiadh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/tgiadh/could_a_bloodless_split_between_east_and_west/,Could a bloodless split between east and west Canada precipitate a secession of the PNW and Alaska into a new independent nation?,/r/Cascadia/comments/tgiadh/could_a_bloodless_split_between_east_and_west/i156qmj/,2,r/Cascadia,0,2

"Cascadia is a bioregion and a significant chunk of Idaho is ecologically comparable to anywhere else in the bioregion.

Politically, Idaho has a long history of being a far-right paradise. The KKK specifically called out Idaho as their target for white-supremacist migration back in like the 1930's to 1960's. The overall population isn't all that conservative either, but you'd never guess that except when it comes to the  polls - because when your neighbour is a Grand Dragon wannabe, you keep your progressive thoughts to yourself.

The far right in Idaho is fucking terrifying. We joke about Vanilla ISIS or Y'all Qaeda, but they take that comparison as a compliment. There's even a white supremacist militia group near the Washington-Idaho border who calls themselves The Base (which in Arabic, would be Al'Qaeda). It's a fucking self-identified Al'Qaeda cell in Washington/Idaho. I have no idea how they aren't all in maximum security prison for the rest of their life.

"It's really unfortunate that you interpreted what I wrote as being some racial challenge, or projecting a flattened view of indigenous diversity. I thought I professed my own ignorance on this stuff pretty clearly, and I literally said I want indigenous autonomy haha. I mean that not hypothetically. I was just trying to explore what would be real problems to plan for if it happens, such as internal division and power-struggles, which should be taken into account when considering any human society.

Fact is, you sort of set this question up with an implicit ethnic concept of ""us"" and ""them"", and you reinforce it in your reply here. Rather than assume people are racist zombies that want to reinforce that colonial mindset, let's just look at how to actually dismantle and transfer power under different scenarios. That's all I'm trying to do. I interpreted your post as imagining the Cascadia region being independent and populated as it is now but governed by indigenous people-- is that not the one sentence version? Unless you're defining Indigenous as something other than nations or confederacies that are *ethnically* distinct from Euro-American ones, then I'm not sure how what you're describing wouldn't be a kind of ethnostate, ya know? Would euro-american descendants eventually be absorbed into an indigenous identity and participate in governance? Surely they couldn't and shouldn't at first, right? How would we adapt the existing systems you describe to implement a confederacy the size of Cascade with tens of millions of people living in it? Again, not challenging here, just thinking. 

Also, at this point in history, a Cascadian autonomous indigenous confederacy would be enclosed by hard international borders and surrounded by groups that want to destabilize and take over. I guess that kind of ruins the entire hypothetical of Cascadia, doesn't it.

Again, your knowledge about traditional governances is awesome and it's totally relevant, but so is the fact that existing social and geopolitical realities would introduce conflicts.

"Your assumptions are somewhat fair but I have to remind you, we aren’t “Chiefdoms” we are nations and confederacies. All nations had a diffuse of power among many chiefs and so on. Even then the chief position and titles in general don’t carry the same weight as in our society. One would say “I am chief” and another would respond “so? I am a shaman/medicine man/elder etc.” 

We have checks on power, and systems which specifically prevent coopting power. The only reason there is single chiefs and a single, small council is because like I said, colonialism forced it upon us. 

In my nation for example you had different chiefs, war chiefs for diplomacy and warfare, minor chiefs for running things back home and chiefs for internal decision making within the band or nation or confederated levels. There is not chiefs above the band level. So no national chief or no confederal chief. No representatives above the level of the band. So for a nation to make a decision all bands must agree, and for the confederacy to agree the nations must all agree. 

This is far from chiefdomship, and I believe that this conception is quite indicative of ignorance in terms of how power and governance structures work traditionally.

We aren’t asking for the land back based on ethnicity, our nations aren’t exclusive to ethnicities. I’m half Honduran half Kainai but I’m still part of my nation and confederacy with no separation under law or even informally in the culture/society. 

Our nations are multi ethnic, there’s Crees and denezage descendants and descendants of Lakota/nakota, peoples (nakoda) all live in my confederacy. Though they’ll identify both by their confederation and their ethnicity, because they aren’t tied to another.

For example: the nuchanulth have dozens of nations and ethnicities in their confederacy and not even all of them agreed to the self governance agreement in BC. Since a didhidaht isn’t the same as a pacheedaht. They’re seperate ethnicities part of the same confederacy: the nuchanulth.
The cree literally stretch from BC, to the Hudson Bay and northern Quebec to the maritimes and this one language family area holds dozens of ethnic groups. But they’re still called “cree” as one ethnicity. When I’m reality that’s simply not the case.

We don’t want our nations based on ethnicity, the only reason you see it as such is because you don’t see us for what we are, hundreds of diverse ethnicities living in multiethnic nations and confederacies, but you instead carry the colonial views that we are either all one race so when we want autonomy you view us as one single race asking to seperate from the rest of society, or at best, you see us as single ethnic tribes whom divide each other based on tribal affiliation.

Sorry but we aren’t primitive tribal peoples, whom couldn’t see each other as anything else but “us them different Ooga blogs” we were/are nations and confederacies whom lived multiethnic populations because of many of the forced migrations, the old trade networks, war, adoption, etc. 

So I’ll say it one final time, you’re not giving us our land based on ethnicity/race, you’re giving us our land back because our nations were promised that/never surrendered it to your nation. 

You’re the one who sees ethnicity/race here, when that’s not the case.

"This makes me wonder, how could a realistic transfer of power to indigenous groups occur? Are there any historical examples of a) an indigenous group truly regaining autonomy over heavily populated colonized lands, and b) it didn't devolve into conflict and war? 

If hypothetical autonomy were achieved then the ideas you've mentioned for adaptation of traditional governance systems sound interesting and great, but even given a strong Cascadia movement, how to orchestrate the transition? Even in a collapse scenario with a power vacuum, it seems likely there would be militant resistance between the Cascadians, the State, and separatist groups, which is culturally devastating over long periods (as if U.S. conquest wasn't?). 

I'm in over my head here, but I imagine if there were a large Cascadian separatist movement, it would be mainly driven by a working-class solidarity that has to transcend ethnic divisions at its core. It's hard to imagine an ideology of ethnic supremacy of any kind being successful or humane in the long run-- it wasn't during U.S. westward expansion, it isn't now, won't be in the future. And it *would* be ethnic supremacy if we're talking about transferring political power to individuals or groups based on lineage/ethnicity. I want indigenous autonomy, but we'd need to avoid a situation where chiefdoms start vying for power and ruling over groups of people who aren't allowed to participate in politics, right?

"If Land Back isn't priority one for your American seperatist movement then you're basically just a hipster white nationalist.

"The Indian Act is Canadian, it wouldn't carry over. And besides most of British Columbia is unceded anyways.

And I said the indigenous peoples make the decision as to what happens to them; a smaller band such as the Qayqayt may prefer to still work within the government structure of a Western nation whereas the much larger and more established Squamish Nation would likely prefer full autonomy.

Edit: I've had this comment on my mind while at work today...

I think further clarification might be needed on my part. Essentially, I think we (the members of a colonizer based dominant state) shouldn't necessarily be involved in the decision of how indigenous peoples want to govern themselves. Thus, we present them the opportunity to determine what they deem appropriate.

"> Why, in any scenario are those the only three options? 

It isn't. That's why I said there are ""at least"" three basic models, and I would presume that any first nations within any of those models will look quite different. There is absolutely nothing within any of those models that limits the abilities of any group to form confederacies, establish free trade, have freedom of movement, or any other relationships. If a tribal group wants to use the model of full independence, then establishing free trade, freedom of movement, etc. are all perfectly in bounds with how international agreements are currently handled.

"First of all, mine isn’t a one size fits all, it’s specifically made so that every native nation can do what it did before, this isn’t even close to a one size fits all approach. Returning to traditional governance is always going to be better than the current band councils system where the chief and council are basically autocrats. (Fun fact the chief and council are The only political positions where the politician decides their own salary) 

Secondly, all three of These are terrible suggestions for the natives.

These are solutions meant for nation states, the natives aren’t nation states. 

1. We don’t want assimilation, we spent 500 years fighting it and had a system of genocide justified by assimilation into “greater Canadian society” means we would want nothing less than autonomy.

2. Why would you continue a system of racial categorization and segregation? Seems kind of fucked that that’s even an option. And why remove the ability to have determination by tribe? 

3. Is basically “Yeah you can have full independence but fuck you you can’t form confederacies or have feee trade with us or have freedom of movement with us, fuck you guys. Oh yeah if you don’t do something we don’t like we are in a position to ruin you economically. Yeah we don’t wanna give that power up” also embassies, immigration check points and etc aren’t things that exist in traditional governance. I don’t see why you would want to seperate people, our autonomy under cascadian occupation doesn’t mean we want to be seperate and distinguished and segregated. We want autonomy so we can better self determine our lives. Since whenever we get that power, prosperity follows for us. Doesn’t mean we can’t all prosper together. Just means we need the ability to say no or yes or to opt out with equal footing to do so.

Why, in any scenario are those the only three options? 

Why not give us autonomy so we can do what we always did. Free trade and cosmopolitanism/freedom of movement.

Ofcourse any international agreement Carrie’s the capacity for war, what you d also forget is that there were systems of diplomacy and checks on power to prevent war between First Nations.

"First of course its very hypothetical because Cascadia is unlikely to ever become independent in our foreseeable future. 

I view the idea of Cascadia as essentially being cultural indoctrination toward a more Cascadian First Nations view of land management and ecological cohabitation. The majesty of Cascadia is apparent to everyone who lives here, first nation's or otherwise, it is our privilege to live here, and our duty to protect it. Fans of Cascadia are all united in a reverence for this bioregion, thats what Cascadia means - even if it is never an independent nation.

So I would expect the first nation's to take a leadership role is defining the cultural goals and guiding principles of the nation of Cascadia. I would hope that the first nation's would want to stay and take on that guiding role. Each group would need to decide that for themselves, possibly even individually. 

Its hard for anyone to speculate beyond that point though without defining what a Cascadia constitution would be, what would this new nation stand for, and would that be acceptable to all involved.

I question if capitalism survives at all, which I think it should, but only in niche luxery markets. It's great for grand pianos, not grandmas medicine. An end to usury and a  maximum wage as well.

I'm on the side that all the tribes should/would decide for themselves. Potentially setting up a union of nations (more EU than US) with free movement, etc. Some might decide to enclave, some might decide to close their borders - and perhaps we should let them, after determining a fair path forward for any individuals disenfranchised by the decision.

If we ever move forward into society 2.0, be it forced on us or self determined, I think any organization or individual seeking public office or social power needs to uphold the truth, ethically and rationally and defend justice on pain of death. We need to be intolerant of intolerance, and  corruption - which is intolerance towards social fairness. 

Transparency enshrined. Where there's obsfuscation there's exploitation. The truth doesn't need a defense, it just is.",t2_10i32evz,Onetime81,0,1646638059.0,0,t1_hzofp5e,hzofp5e,False,3Alsjeblieft,t3_t8ey4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/t8ey4r/if_cascadia_gained_independence_would_you_give/,If cascadia gained independence; would you give autonomy to the unceded territories of the First Nations?,/r/Cascadia/comments/t8ey4r/if_cascadia_gained_independence_would_you_give/hzofp5e/,2,r/Cascadia,0,2

"I think that a one-sized-fits-all approach is always destined to fail. I think at the very least you have three distinct processes/models.

The first model would be full incorporation within Cascadian government, with existing tribal affiliations acting as communities for the purposes of legislative representation, and a community specifically establishes for disenrolled or other unaffiliated indigenous descendants. Tribal councils would still administer community lands and programs as is current, and I'm sure there would be a great deal more in terms of utilizing tribal governance in setting resource policies within their traditional lands. In my preferred government, first nations would be one of the four Cascadian sovereignties, with a ""viceroy"" specifically chosen collectively by those peoples who would have constitutional power.

The second model would basically be the continuation of the current reservation system. It would fundamentally be about pretending that Cascadia is simply taking over the lease on colonial treaties that were made with the Canadian Crown and the United States. Legislative representation would be by location, not tribal affiliation.

The final model is full independence of tribal/first nations lands.

"Old thread, I know, but as a Cascadian with a background in digital graphics I feel compelled to make probably my second ever Reddit post. The original Doug is definitely poorly designed. Nice idea, needs improvement. The vertical stripes definitely work better for contrast with the silhouette, but the stripes alone would be too generic IMHO. Using a simplistic Christmas tree-type icon with well-defined branch levels would stand out from a distance and meets the ""construction paper test"". Possibly shrunk slightly so there's a bit more white space to enhance the contrast rather than going top to bottom, and maybe make it black instead.

"> and like everywhere else they're a tiny minority.

I won't say a minority. The way I describe the fandom is that there's three pillars.

Art - Creativity and expression is the biggest attraction. Whether that's traditional art, fursuits, dancing, etc.

Community - I'm willing to bet most people get into furries for the art, then stay for the extremely supportive, welcoming community. It becomes a life style at some point. Speaking from someone who lives in what we call the scaly house, always having furry room mates that have moved in from around the globe.

Fetish - This absolutely is a big pull for a sizable chunk of people. Especially since the fandom is sort of a safe haven for LGBT peoples. People feel comfortable speaking open about things personal to them.

"While I agree that they're usually not the best people, they're hardly the main cause of our housing issues. 

Some of those issues can be attributed to a lack of new affordable housing, as well as a lack new market price housing even. Most of which is voted against by your neighbors, not entirely by investors.

Some of them can be attributed to bad zoning laws and other building restrictions, such as parking minimums, height minimums, % lot usage, setbacks, etc.

A very large factor is that wages haven't caught up with the cost of living *or* the current inflation rate.

Now, house investors aren't a non-issue either. You're absolutely right that their participation in the housing market as a purely economic venture can making things more difficult for those of us in the market just so we can have somewhere to *live*. Unfortunately, as with most times in history except WW2, we can't really put all the blame on one group of people and actually be accurate and correct.

Latest polls have around 40% of Democratic voters on the West Coast favoring secession or something like it, but that's around 15% of the total population. It might go to 30% if Trump is re-elected or a similar asshat is elected, but you'd need 40-50% for a viable movement.  


Alexander Moss addresses some of the issues here: [A More Perfect Union](https://www.amazon.com/More-Perfect-Union-Briefs-Reimagining-ebook/dp/B09RP78T65/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1645278078&refinements=p_27%3AAlexander+Moss&s=books&sr=1-1). Major sticking points in the event of a U.S. breakup are:  


1. Who gets the national debt and in what percentage?
2. Who gets the military and in what percentage and how can we ensure that the successor states won't go to war with each other (since the White Christofascist Republic will have nukes)?
3. If it is only the West Coast that secedes, what happens to Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Samoa, etc? And how does the remaining U.S. cope with or accept the loss of their main trading ports, seeing as how most imports are from China these days?
4. What does California do for water?

Now, all these issues can be negotiated, but it would be tough, and all sides would need to be willing to come to the table, and the sides dominated by conservative whackadoodles have not been known for their own sanity or for compromise.

No, it is not. Again, the only currently operating train lines that have a regular operating speed over 200 mph are the trains in China. The links you posted are about lines being developed and tested, not in current use. Germany has a line that can reach 205 mph, but only does so when it's running late. It's normal operating speed is 186 mph (300 kph). All the other fastest trains in the world top out at 320 kph which is 198 mph. And those speeds are only reached on the express trains that don't stop at small stations. The equivalent train on this line would pass right by Bellingham and only the slower trains would stop.
