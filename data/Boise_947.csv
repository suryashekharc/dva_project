I get where you're coming from with the contract being optional, but I just don't believe that it requires legislation and I believe the legislation might lead to constitutional complications and negative impacts to the work environment for people who serve their four-year residency. In my opinion, this contract creates the potential for lower wages, abusive work environments, and fear of being fired or blacklisted in the state due to our ""Right to Work"" laws to become normalized, which runs the risk of making an already difficult career into an absolute nightmare.

Also, your job is the one that made that agreement with you and the terms of the contract were not defined by the state legislature. Private businesses 100% have the right to create these forms of contracts. The question is not whether private institutions have the right to create contract with their employees but rather whether the legislature is able to mandate regulations related to the educational process that would limit the interstate Commerce (service) of recipients. Given that these are public funds provided by the state and federal government, there are certain legal requirements that must be followed when crafting legislation that changes how they operate.

"Here's the thing. It kinda seems like overall as a society no one wants to raise their kids. Pre industrial revolution vast majority of families worked together on a plot of land. Then we needed men at the factory and women got stuck with most of the child rearing and public schools to prepare for factory work. Then society worked towards doubling the work force by getting women to work (the middle class rose up after the plague wiped out so many people that labor shortages gave workers negotiation power)(I'm not saying women shouldn't work but now both parents are typically not home and give their best 40+ hours a week to not their kids) Idaho economy is construction and industrial based so they support lower education standards so people's options are limited to back breaking 50+ hour a week physical labor jobs.

"My favorite thing about this ploy is that, much like prior attempts to defund Idaho Public Television, the effect of eliminating the ICfL would be kneecapping services to rural, small tax base, deeply Republican communities. 

You know what the Idaho Commission for Libraries actually provides? A[ statewide interlibrary loan management system](https://libraries.idaho.gov/shareidaho/), allowing small communities to tap in to the nationwide OCLC catalog, saving rural taxpayers thousands and thousands of dollars on titles they don't need to physically own. 

[ICfL manages LiLI](https://lili.org/), providing FREE access to scientific and trade journals, research articles, archived news, and other educational material for the public. LiLI is particularly useful for parents and children, whether they're in public schools, private schools, online school, or pure homeschooling. The EBSCO database is an incredible resource whether you're writing a school report or trying to manage an onion farm, I cannot overstate how much information is available to the public here. 

LiLI also gives the public unlimited access to the complete catalog of Chilton manuals and Consumer Reports, which are obviously great resources for anyone trying to spend their money carefully and live as self sufficiently as possible. More enterprising adults may be interested in the Small Business Resource Center, or the Vocational and Career Collection. These resources are vetted, they're high quality, they provide the best information and they protect citizens from being tricked or scammed. 

Finally, the Idaho Commission for Libraries exists [as a matter of state law](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title33/T33CH25/SECT33-2501/). You can peruse [the statutes](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title33/t33ch25/) yourself, and see that there actually are robust systems in place to regulate library activities. None of the existing methods of challenging or altering the system have actually been pursued, these dinguses went straight to trying to blow up the whole thing. Libraries in Idaho are required to serve their communities, and libraries regularly make decisions about service *at the community level,* no nanny-state oversight required. ICfL serves communities, not the other way around. 

PS: Big systems like Boise and Meridian would be FAR less impacted by ICfL being crippled than small libraries in deep red districts. Why should the Little Wood River Library in Carey lose all of the resources provided by ICfL just because Boise has a copy of Genderqueer?

"If it is an agreement being made between the educational facility and the student, does it not make sense for the arrangements to be made by the impacted parties rather than the legislature? They not bound by the same rules of a legislature when crafting a document.

To be clear, I actually really like the organization and what it does but the moment the legislature is involved in forcing this, it's going to open up the floodgates to a lot of questions and I'm going to be honest by saying that I think the State Legislature getting involved does run the risk of violating the Commerce Clause.


I also personally believe that this might violate the Higher Education Act of 1965, but I have to admit that I am not well versed on the standards by which these contracts are regulared:

SEC. 111. 20 U.S.C. 1011 ANTIDISCRIMINATION.

"While I see that residencies are a bigger issue and that this may not be a good law, I fail to see how it becomes unconstitutional. Alaska has had this scheme for years and there was even a TV show about it in the 90’s, northern exposure. If the state is funding or discounting your education they can put terms on that help.

I believe Alaska’s law specifically terms it as “a loan which is paid back by practicing medicine in the state for a certain period.”

So in no way am I arguing this is a “good” law, but it almost certainly doesn’t violate the commerce clause of the constitution, or any other clause of the US constitution.

"My reply was to someone saying “take the church out of government” because of this law passing. This isn’t a law that was passed by or for a church. It may have included people with religious ideology, which is really something the Framers intended to protect. Freedom of Religion implies society would include people of the various religions and those without as a collective. The Framers intended to prevent specific religion from making laws others must follow, aka the British system at the time. For example kosher law is a lot easier to say applies to a specific church (belief system) and would be a violation to enforce those beliefs on all in the USA.

Your own examples list many times when “God” was mentioned in Government activities, like treaties with other countries. Everson v Board of Education 1947 also stated that providing tax payer money for bus fees for students that went to private religious based schools was not a violation of the First Amendment because while tax money was spent on such endeavors it did not favor one religion over another or punish non-religious members. There may be a wall between the church (entities) and the State…. but it was never meant to keep religion out of society.

"The “back” of Veterans Memorial Park, that whole southern-ish end. Specifically, the area south of the path from the parking lot. If you follow that path around as it turns north, there are a few fields in the southeast corner of the park.

Those large fields could be nice, they don’t need to be lawn but it’s ugly as sin when the spring grass dies off (area backing up to some houses). There’s also a pretty big gravel pit south of the the canal footbridge that’s been barren since the pathways were improved several years ago. And next to the canal is miserable.

"Look at the state of foster care in Idaho. Look at funding for education. Look at whether or not these bans decrease abortion. Look at what they do to maternal mortality rates among women who want to keep their pregnancies.

This isn’t about protecting kids. This isn’t about protecting life.

If the GOP in this state cared about protecting life, they wouldn’t be trying to pass HB658 so they could execute our prisoners behind a veil of secrecy.

Add to all of that, there’s no real basis for this in the Bible, and the few passages mentioning anything even close to abortions suggest they can be permissible in certain circumstances. Whether or not the Bible condemned abortion was a matter of debate until 1869 for Catholics, and 1980 for American Christians—years that coincide with major political tensions. Basically, the GOP needed a strategy for defeating Jimmy Carter, and suddenly abortion was a clear cut issue. 

The legislature literally passed the bill on Idaho Women’s Day as a dog whistle to misogynists.

This is purely about dehumanizing women. They know it’s unconstitutional, they know it kills more people than it decreases abortion, they dgaf what happens to the kids after they’re born, if they know *anything* about political and religious history they know it has *nothing* to do with the Bible.

"While this is how the current supreme court is starting to twist things, this is neither historic NOR correct.

Separation of church and state is something that's been a fundamental part of US history.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Religious_Test_Clause

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman

There is no ""originalist"" or traditional jurisprudence that justifies mixing church and state.

Now, the government can't restrict legislators from using their religious views to write laws.  That much is clear.  However, the establishment clause VERY clearly was about not favoring one religion over another.  It restricts government from making a muslim nation.

And, for a clear counter example that's stood for 70 years of ""restricting church from government"".  I present the Johnson amendment.

"Your talk is cheap and tactless. The only word you wrote worth anything is “choice”. That’s the whole fucking idea!!! CHOICE. Privacy! Liberty! In all your research you didn’t even read the case notes of Roe vs Wade or Planned Parenthood vs Casey? You are densely full of yourself.

I didn’t want the responsibility. I got pregnant and placed the baby for adoption with a family that lives in a deep Blue state the farthest distance away from any Red states. 

The experience was not “joyful”, “rewarding”, or any other garbage the pro-birth people vomit. I couldn’t afford to even feed myself. “Welfare” is a joke in Idaho for single citizens. Being a starving poor pregnant person not being able to put on the minimum amount of weight during pregnancy complicates and ruins a person’s body. Not everyone’s adoption journey is like mine, but it’s uncontrollable. Draw sticks. “Not wanting the responsibility” is being self aware enough to know that you’d be ruining a breathing, walking, growing child’s life if you did have the responsibility. Having an abortion is being self aware enough to know that you’d be ruining a lot more than just that.

"Oh even better.

It means that those without the means to get abortions will instead get them in much more dangerous ways.  It will mean more dumpster babies.  It will mean raped children will be forced to have babies.  It will mean children with fatal and painful birth defects will be born.  It will mean raped women will have children.  It will mean that children too young to have children will be forced to go through labor (with some negative outcomes for both mother and child). [1]

Sure, the pro-lifers get to play like they are saving the lives of a baby (or whatever)... Really, this is all about punishing women for having sex while ignoring all the horrific negatives.  But hey, more babies to people that don't want them.  Because, obviously, the absolute best household to raise a child in is one where that child is unwanted.

Now, let's talk about why gay couples shouldn't be allowed to adopt children.  Because the same people against abortion also want to restrict who can adopt.

"I understand his reasoning, it still made my jaw drop that he did this. I thought he would just let the bill pass without taking action, and not say anything about it.  


Copy-pasting from another thread I was discussing this in:  


>The 1st issue is that Little has an election this fall, and if he speaks out against the bill without signing it he hands the election to McGeachin. Also, not signing the bill just allows it to go into law by default. So, leaving it unsigned was a no-go if he wanted to speak against it, and would be pointless from an outcomes perspective.  
The 2nd issue is that if he vetos it it gets sent back to the legislature and a veto override vote is called. Basically a veto just sets a bar that says without the executive branch being on board you need a larger majority of legislature to sign it. Idaho.gov says the veto override is a two-thirds majority. Considering the initial support the bill had, it's likely that it would have a two-thirds majority when it went back. So, not only would it still go through, but again we end up with McGeachin as governor this fall.  
...with all of that said I think the Governor vetoing it on the grounds that it's unconstitutional, will lead to a scorched earth war on our constitutional rights, and turns citizens into state sponsored Orwellian spies would sway at least a few members of Idaho's legislature. I think he could have also made a convincing appeal to Republican voters about why this isn't the right way to fight Roe v Wade. I understand Little's reasoning, but I still think he is a spineless coward that just prioritized his re-election campaign over the future of both our state and country.  
Also, as one of (I hope) many people that called his office to make this exact argument to him, I think part of his speech against it was to appeal to moderate Republicans who see the constitutional issues with these bounty hunter bills. He wants to pro-life vote and the moderate vote this fall.

While not being those things tends towards later awareness.

As for the specific claim that most women don't know in the first six weeks, that is supported by the data:

>In addition, the percentage of women who reported timing of pregnancy awareness at 6 weeks or less was 23 % in the NSFG and 28 % in the PRAMS data.

"Yeah, but that one is even more unconstitutional. The whole warrant system is likely to be ruled incredibly unconstitutional due to the fact that the initial Roe v Wade decision relied on the Constitutional protection of privacy...



>[The Texas law infringed on women's right to privacy, was overly broad and violated the due process clause in the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment here, the decision said.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion-roevwade-explainer-idUSKCN26E1LU)

>""This right of privacy...is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent.

>""Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it.

...and the Restriction of travel to other states is a whole different can of worms, given the Commerce Clause specifically delegates the right to regulate Commerce to the federal government rather than the state governments.

>The Congress shall have Power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes

Either of these you should lead to a swift dismissal if it even gets close to the Supreme Court.

Given that the Roe v Wade decision did allow for the prohibition of third trimester pregnancies except under certain circumstances, I think it is much more likely that any successful attempt to alter the Roe v Wade decision will be based upon modifying the acceptable date range of abortions, as has been the case in many states for a long time and is the case with this legislation.

As much as I hate to say it, a bill like this one stands a much greater chance of altering the Roe v Wade decision. Also, I have a funny feeling that all of these virtue signaling bills are intended more as a weed I thought the electorate in the lead-up to midterm elections than good faith legislation.

"It's a two fold issue:

The 1st issue is that Little has an election this fall, and if he speaks out against the bill without signing it he hands the election to McGeachin. Also, not signing the bill just allows it to go into law by default. So, leaving it unsigned was a no-go if he wanted to speak against it, and would be pointless from an outcomes perspective.

The 2nd issue is that if he vetos it it gets sent back to the legislature and a veto override vote is called. Basically a veto just sets a bar that says without the executive branch being on board you need a larger majority of legislature to sign it. Idaho.gov says the veto override is a two-thirds majority. Considering the initial support the bill had, it's likely that it would have a two-thirds majority when it went back. So, not only would it still go through, but again we end up with McGeachin as governor this fall.

...with all of that said I think the Governor vetoing it on the grounds that it's unconstitutional, will lead to a scorched earth war on our constitutional rights, and turns citizens into state sponsored Orwellian spies would sway at least a few members of Idaho's legislature. I think he could have also made a convincing appeal to Republican voters about why this isn't the right way to fight Roe v Wade. I understand Little's reasoning, but I still think he is a spineless coward that just prioritized his re-election campaign over the future of both our state and country.  


EDIT: Also, as one of (I hope) many people that called his office to make this exact argument to him, I think part of his speech against it was to appeal to moderate Republicans who see the constitutional issues with these bounty hunter bills. He wants to pro-life vote and the moderate vote this fall. Basically, the only real argument you need is that Brad Little has an election campaign coming up, and our rights be damned, he wants to win.",t2_badj2,I_Heart_Squids,0,1648070061.0,0,t1_i1ujo1f,i1ujo1f,False,UniqueRegion0,t3_tlafbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise/comments/tlafbp/gov_little_signs_bill_banning_abortions_after_6/,Gov.

"Therapist here. Yeah, people are booked full these days. And if the person in question is an adult, there is no compelling them to attend therapy. In addition to that, if they were to find a therapist, the therapist could not speak with you about the client unless the client provided an ROI for you for that very specific information. I suggest you and the rest of this person's support system seek individual therapy and perhaps family therapy for those who are willing to attend. It may mean you have to get on a few waitlists.  Don't hold out for just one to call back. Using psychologytoday can help to find someone with openings. Plus, therapy is like dating - it may take a bit to find the right fit. 

There is something called the Stages of Change. I often provide education for my clients who are in similar positions as you when they are struggling with the other person's lack of desire to get help. It helps in recognition of the fact that you cannot force the person in need of help to seek help. We have a phrase as counselors - you can't do more work than the person sitting across from you. The same goes for anyone in a support system. Setting boundaries, reconfiguring relational dynamics, deciding and acting in accordance with what is acceptable to you and what isn't, and working through the grief of loss of this person to addiction/mental illness are all just a few appropriate goals for treatment of someone in a supportive role.  

 If the sibling is ever ready, I have worked with people who have attended programs at Northpoint/Ashwood (they offer mental health and addictions), The Walker Center, and Brick house Recovery. Cottonwood also offers mental health IOP programs in addition to their inpatient services. Again, you cannot force them to attend. Your local crisis center is also a great resource if someone is on the fence w/ risk to self/ risk of relapse and just needs to get through the night or the day. 

(CW: suicide. death by police) If you are worried the person is presenting imminent risk of suicide and they refuse to go to an inpatient center, you *can* call the police and they may be taken in to a hospital for a safety hold. This is not treatment. It is with the sole goal of stabilizing for discharge.  I do not recommend this in 99% of cases, especially as there is a high risk associated with police not being mental health workers and escalating situations to a degree that it results in death. I have never had a client in my office who has reported an involuntary hospitalization that did not experience some trauma associated with the encounter. It is an extreme last resort, but that's really just food for thought.

I second the suggestion made by the previous commenter and will also throw in that calling 211 and asking for mental health aid may be especially helpful if you believe you or your family will have difficulty paying for services.",t2_7duhg2e2,Flabbergasted_Fool1,0,1647988257.0,0,t1_i1pztwv,i1pztwv,False,Remarkable-House-729,t3_tidtj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise/comments/tidtj7/need_resources_for_family_supoort/,Need Resources for Family Supoort,/r/Boise/comments/tidtj7/need_resources_for_family_supoort/i1pztwv/,1,r/Boise,0,1

"As I mentioned to another user on r/Idaho:

The modern day American pro-life movement has no basis in the bible. It was manufactured as a political ploy in the late 70s when the GOP was looking at facing off with Jimmy Carter and needed a way to unite the American religious vote behind them. Previously, Pope Pius IX had banned abortions in Catholicism in 1869 after fears Protestants were beginning to outnumber Catholics (prior to that, whether and when abortions were criticized in the Bible was a matter of fierce debate amongst Catholics). Note, that it took 1869 years after the death of Christ for a Catholic pope to decide abortions were a clear-cut issue. The GOP saw how well Catholics had taken to the myth of ""killing babies"", and decided it would make a good motivator. They started working with Evangelist groups such as the National Rights to Life Committee, to create misinformation pieces they disseminated to churches across the country.

But, even if that doesn't matter to you, even if your sole focus is on saving lives, the basic facts are that study after study have shown that abortion bans do not decrease abortion rates. Rather, what they do is increase maternal mortality. Women who want abortions will travel out of state, order pills online, perform at home abortions, or even commit suicide if none of those options are available to them. But, the truly insidious part of this bill is what it does to women who want to keep their pregnancies. For many women who want to carry their pregnancies to term, if they find themselves needing emergency medical care, [bills like this will leave them to die if they cannot get out of state in enough time to avoid going into sepsis](https://www.kpcc.org/npr-news/2022-02-28/doctors-worst-fears-about-the-texas-abortion-law-are-coming-true)

Lastly, this bill forces victims of rape and incest to carry the child of their assaulter.

…

There’s no basis for this outside of a political power game. What’s twisted about this particular bill is that it’s also offering people bounties to act as spies for the state—it’s a literal Orwellian nightmare. Add to that, this bill structure allows for work arounds of *all* our constitutional rights, including gun ownership.

If it’s a new home for you but not a new build, you can call Idaho power and get the usage from the last 12 months. If it’s a new build, then I’d wait at least 6 months especially since we’re coming on the bulk of power usage during summer.
