"Bingo. Giving more money to cops won't put a dent in crime. They already suck at catching criminals, and it's not because they don't have enough APCs and heavy weaponry and neat-o gadgets. Catching criminals comes down to a) people who are not cops and often aren't even part of the pd, and b) cops doing shit they can do - walking and talking - not only with bare minimal equipment, but arguably they will do it *better* if they're not ultra intimidating.

And that's just *catching* criminals after a crime has already happened. ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" - You know who makes the mental calculation that they are definitely going to get caught for such-and-such crime, but since the local cop shop doesn't have as much SWAT gear as they'd like, getting caught won't be as bad as it could be? Fucking nobody. Nobody makes that decision. People either, in order of likelihood, don't think ahead / consider consequences *at all* before committing a crime, or they do think ahead but they're confident they won't get caught so it doesn't fucking matter how well-equipped the cops are, or they think ahead and think there's a good chance they'll get caught but they don't care, because short of getting killed - which any cop with any cheap 9mm can do - the consequences that *really* matter are the ones that come *after* the cops are done with you.

Police have done a fantastic job of marketing themselves as the answer to crime, but they're just not. They have a role to serve but that ain't it, and if the goal is to reduce and prevent crime, the money going to all their military-grade gear is almost certainly better spent elsewhere.",t2_8aib,oditogre,0,1648285109.0,0,t1_i268lhw,i268lhw,False,IdRatherBeLurking,t3_to2pza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/to2pza/bloom_just_in_a_denver_jury_just_awarded_over_13/,[Bloom] Just in: A Denver jury just awarded over $13 million in damages to protesters injured by DPD officers in the 2020 George Floyd protests.

"No where did I say we couldnt do better. Don't put words in my mouth.

What I am saying is that the majority of police officers are not bad. If you were to find a way to audit each and every officer for their actions vs intentions you would without a doubt find that they are doing what they think is right for the community about 75% of the time with another 20% of that gap being blocked from doing what is right by protocol. That remaining 5% is the problem. People who have the ability to do what is right but choose not to put of self interest of some sort. Now what we see is once again most of the investigations can't prove to the level required to prosecute what the intentions of the officer were. Are there some officers who cover for one another?

"Yes!  if the local cops are corrupt and don’t want cbi’s help the corrupt cops do not request assistance. Then cbi can’t investigate without expressed written permission from the da, the police chief, or sheriff. 

The da in Arvada is inexperienced. The sheriff is old school and doesn’t want to know if the cops are corrupt. The police chief is in on the coverup. I’ve never been able to contact the governor.

So cbi can not investigate. 
 
If your co-workers investigated Arvada pd the way they investigated aurora they would find the same corruption and coverups. Does that make sense?

I want to remove “when requested “ part so cbi can investigate the anything anywhere in the state without being requested by the corrupt cops trying to cover up their own crimes.

"some schools offer the early college programs and you could also look for ""concurrent enrollment"" classes. Those classes give you college credit as well as high school credit and are typically taken at the high school or online but taught by an instructorwho is credentialed or employed by a college. So you could ask around for which high schools have concurrent enrollment options OR if there is a college you have in mind, contact their concurrent enrollment office to see who they partner with. 

another thing you can look at is the ""transfer articulation guides"" on the Colorado department of higher education website. they will show you specific classes to take either through concurrent enrollment or at a community College that will be ""guaranteed transfers"" when you get to a 4 year university, if that is your end goal. The guides also help you determine which classes to take for a specific associates degree. 

it's wise to look ahead because you can save so much money- and also I'll cosign what others are saying... go easy on yourself,  enjoy the ride, and use your resources (like advisors and counselors).",t2_9phiqyf3,bowmar17,0,1648269786.0,0,t1_i25po98,i25po98,True,CeeTechNG,t3_tofv0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/tofv0h/early_colleges/,Early Colleges,/r/Denver/comments/tofv0h/early_colleges/i25po98/,2,r/Denver,0,2

"Who or what agency investigated aurora for the death of Elijah McCain, and didn’t find any wrongdoing until outside investigations exposed the corruption?

In February 2020, Aurora City Manager Jim Twombly announced that he would begin a Critical Incident Review on the case to investigate how police and fire departments reacted during the incident. He also announced an audit on the body cameras of the Aurora Police Department to further investigate how well Aurora police officers comply with body-camera policies. At that time he said that a review of the incident determined that the force applied during the encounter was consistent with training as determined by the Force Review Board.[31]

"I’m talking about official corruption. When a cop breaks the law they’re investigated by other officers in a CIRT investigation. When a cop is abusive CIRT covers it up. So abusive cops stay on the job and abuse people at riots. If CIRT worked there would be prosecutions, and corrupt abusive cops would be fired from CIRT findings. But CIRT never works. 

CIRT is state wide. 

My complaints are from the state level. 

Denver operates under the laws of the state. 

Elijah McCain was in aurora. Arvada, aurora, Denver and wheat ridge, boulder, Pueblo, all use the CIRT system… never once have they ever prosecuted or found themselves at fault. 

I realize this is confusing. But trying to fix one department at a time when we have problems at the state level is a waste of time money and energy. 

It makes more sense to fight the official corruption at the state level. Just because aurora got caught perjuring the CIRT system doesn’t mean the other departments aren’t doing the exact same thing. If CIRT worked there would be evidence in the form of prosecutions and changes to the system. 


But Because they’ve never once found fault in the actions of officers, it’s my position that we change the system.

"This was a Federal trial and it sounds like the officers were not sued individually because of how absurd the Federal court's QI system is. Basically an officer has to violate someone's civil rights, have them go to trial and spend 6-7 figures on legal costs, receive no monetary justice, but fight all the way through to a verdict and appeals, then another case has to be identical and that next person might be able to sue the officers personally. The way Federal courts, with a long history of racism, have twisted 150 years of Federal civil rights laws to render them essentially moot when used against police, is absurd. That's right, QI is an invention of the Federal courts. If the courts bothered to read what Congress passed as far back as the 1870s, the prisons would be full of corrupt cops.

In future state court cases, I believe the part of the new reform law  from last year that ended qualified immunity in CO doesn't take effect until July.

"Qualified Immunity is an immunity from *suit*, not just damages.  The fact that this proceeded to trial means that the judge already found that Qualified Immunity did not apply to the individual officer(s).  There are rare instances where a judge might not decide the QI issue after a verdict is returned, but this probably isn't one of those. 

That being said, this particular trial mostly involved claims against Denver itself for maintaining policies or practices leading to excessive force.  It is my understanding that there was only one individual defendant that was a police officer (claims against the other individual officers were resolved prior to trial, but I haven't really looked to see why -- i.e. dismissal for insufficiency vs. settlement).  So the vast majority of the verdict will be paid by Denver and its insurers and/or taxpayers.

The verdict against the individual officer could result in him being personally-liable for the award against him, but in practice, police union contracts call upon the city to indemnify officers for litigation verdicts against them arising out of official duties or arrange for insurance to cover such verdicts.

"Peak to Peak scenic byway is great. Driving through any of the canyon roads between Golden and Boulder are also fun and eventually all link up to Peak to Peak. My cousin came out a couple years ago in November and for someone who’s barely left the NYC area, he loved the drive. 

If you’re up for a fullish day of driving, you could head out towards Black Hawk, come up through Nederland, have a picnic up at Brainard Lake, then bomb down Sunshine Canyon and end the day with dinner in Boulder (or even the Gold Hill Inn if it’s open!). Nice thing is you’ll skip the RMNP lines/traffic and park fee (especially if they’re still do reservations). Quick Maps route says ~2.5 hrs total driving. It’s gorgeous and you see almost everything but the red rocks and deserts of Colorado.

"I spent 10 years working as an audio visual tech around the Denver area.  I tried to work with IATSE when I first started but it’s a really hard group to work with.

There are 4 lists A,B,C, and D.  You start on the D list as a “referrant” and have to work 500 hours to get off D and onto C.  Then it’s 1000 hours to get from c to b then 2000 hours to get from b to a.  The A listers get the first calls for work, then the B’s and so on.

So unless the city is outrageously busy the D listers don’t get much work.  And most all of the nice theatre and music gigs are going to be filled by people with a hell of a lot more seniority than you.  Most likely, the small amount of work you will see will be at the convention center driving a forklift or kicking carpet.

IATSE does do Red Rocks but not the Pepsi Center.  The Pepsi Center uses Rhino Staging for all thier load ins. For AV work there is Image, Multimedia, and Spectrum Audiovisual.  There were  a couple of large touring groups in town but I think Clearwing bought most of them so I think it’s just Clearwing and Brown Note Productions now.

IATSE is the only union in Denver that I know of that does this kind of work.  Most people find something else and move on long before they make it off the d list.",t2_k8fwgfqz,ResourceOk4637,0,1648251220.0,0,t1_i24poht,i24poht,True,brok3ncor3,t3_tnm5dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/tnm5dc/iatse_local_7_pros_cons/,IATSE LOCAL 7 Pros & Cons,/r/Denver/comments/tnm5dc/iatse_local_7_pros_cons/i24poht/,4,r/Denver,0,4

"Yeah let me know. 

The permitting wasn’t fun, but so long as there aren’t changes to your plan, you can get the ball rolling pretty much as soon as the permit is issued. 

The permitting took like 2 months. I don’t know if that’s normal, or just pandemic delay, but it was a lot of hurry up and wait. 

I think you could realistically construct the thing in 2 weeks after your permit is issued.

Mine took 2 months because I had to make plan changes, so we couldn’t get framing inspected until the revised plans were approved.

But total working time was about 2 weeks. 

Some things to keep in mind: 

1) You will need a boundary survey if you’re building it within 3 feet of your neighboring property line, and near your alleyway set back (which is probably 5 feet). Those can take a couple of weeks to get processed.

2) Concrete needs to cure for about a week before you can build on it.",t2_465fjpz,ovaltine23,0,1648251121.0,0,t1_i24pgms,i24pgms,False,WookieMonsta,t3_tnc79b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/tnc79b/costs_of_building_a_garage/,Costs of Building a Garage?,/r/Denver/comments/tnc79b/costs_of_building_a_garage/i24pgms/,1,r/Denver,0,1

The 3% locked in appreciation would be a major sticking point for me. Although at the same time over the last 20 years a 3% appreciation rate would've kept pace with inflation for the most part; there are a couple of exceptions being between Q3 of 2007 to Q4 of 2008 & from Q2 of 2021 through to the present. I'd think it would be better for the home's equity to at least remain its same value if the appreciation was tied to the annual CPI released by the Bureau of Labor than doing it at a fixed percentage rate.,t2_t064x,gulunk,0,1648245619.0,0,t1_i24d67z,i24d67z,False,brofax,t3_tnp4tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/tnp4tl/this_is_what_net_zero_allelectric_affordable/,"This is what net zero, all-electric affordable housing looks like in Basalt",/r/Denver/comments/tnp4tl/this_is_what_net_zero_allelectric_affordable/i24d67z/,2,r/Denver,0,2

"The traditional definition of ""net zero"" is that the home produces as much as it uses, even if the timing is off.  I have yet to see a battery requirement in the net-zero category of homes.  And my statement about rough cost-parity does not include the cost of batteries.  That would be a straight added-cost.

For the moment, full net-metering is actually part of Colorado law.  It would take an act of the legislature to change net metering.  Could this be changed in the future?  Sure.  But I'd say we're at least a decade out from that being an issue anyways.

California is an instructive example, as rooftop solar is popular enough that the state has excess electricity at peak summer solar production times.  The utilities tried to make changes to the rate structure in order to make rooftop solar less attractive. Their proposal pretty much got laughed out of consideration.

"Maybe. But if electricity rates do go up, efficient homes with solar and batteries will be even more valuable. But with Colorado’s push for more renewables, we may have some time before utilities are able to drop their net metering programs. 

Also, if developed together like this, solar and battery costs will be much better than if each home installed them individually (due to economies of scale, it’s easier to finance these as one big project, mobilization costs spread across multiple projects). There are a lot of benefits to having solar on your home, and it’s something lower income people normally don’t have the opportunity to benefit from.

"Thats what almost every single person under 30 says when they are looking to buy a house (myself included, i just bought one this year). 

The logistics of non-traditional material builds, especially in cheap land remote areas are a nightmare, nobody will even give you a quote to give to your mortgage company. 

Do you know a company that is knowledgable of the materieals you have selected _and_ knows how to apply them to your areas building codes? 

Cheap land also means no nearby utilities. A septic system alone can be 20K, you will need a well too which can add another 20-40K. 

Theres a reason these non-traditional material houses almost never make it past a few demo homes, its because they struggle to scale against the fierce competition from ecologically concious building materials that fit into existing contruction workflows (neutral lumber, rockwool insulatuon, k-briq, HUKR, USG wallboard etc). 

The drastically different looks of the adobe or earthclad buildings are their biggest selling point, but actually dont offer anything substantial ecologically over existing market products.

"Either I put an extra zero, or just put the wrong number - replying to comments while falling asleep isn't the best idea.   But here's the breakdown.

Using rough numbers...Total ""agricultural use"" is roughly 90%, 15% of that is ""acceptable loss"", so roughly 13% of total water use in Colorado goes to agricultural waste.

Total ""municipal and industrial use"" in Colorado is 7%, 25% of which is ""outdoor residential use"" (1.75% of the total).

In my house, roughly 30% of our outdoor water goes to the lawn.  The rest goes to plants.  In other households a portion will go to washing cars, and other uses of outdoor faucets.  So if we say on average 60% of outdoor use is used for lawns, that means lawn watering accounts for 1.05% of total water use in Colorado.

So agricultural waste works out to roughly 13x higher than lawn watering.

"It is super interesting! You might have seen shades or louvers on some office buildings or contemporary residential. Basically the idea is that you minimize the heat from the sun when it's hot and maximize the solar heat when it's cold by being thoughtful about your geometry and materials. 

In simple terms, a house with white paint and four foot eaves is going to take a lot less energy to cool than a black brick wall with no overhang/shade.

If you want to get nerdy about it, look at some of the charts here: [https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/denver-colorado.html](https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/denver-colorado.html). Using the heat/solar insolation chart at the bottom you can decide which months you want to shade your southern and western facades. Then you can scroll up to the sun path diagram, get a sun angle, and do some basic triangle math to figure out how the geometry of the shade you need. Making that shade into useful space like these balconies is a simple and pleasant way to do it.

why i say it wont remain net zero, is when, not if, more people invest in solar to escape rising electrical rates...the utility company is going to start raising rates, customer connection fees for people with solar panels especially for people with battery back up systems due to loss of revenue.  they will cease to buy back energy and instead start to charge customers for electricity being put back onto the grid.  this is inevitable.",t2_2m23055n,poopnada,0,1648232074.0,0,t1_i23g8pn,i23g8pn,False,brofax,t3_tnp4tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/tnp4tl/this_is_what_net_zero_allelectric_affordable/,"This is what net zero, all-electric affordable housing looks like in Basalt",/r/Denver/comments/tnp4tl/this_is_what_net_zero_allelectric_affordable/i23g8pn/,0,r/Denver,0,0
