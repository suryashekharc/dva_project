I think it supposed to wear trails down more evenly/slowly and going in the other direction is a lot like having another trail.  It can make quite the difference. Also you don't have to worry about traffic going towards you. It's pretty nice.  Nicely marked so there is no confusion.  I think they basically call it a red day or yellow day.,t2_5zeud,sneakylfc,0,1647981119.0,0,t1_i1phzuq,i1phzuq,False,sneakylfc,t3_tjp44l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Williamsport/comments/tjp44l/mountain_biking_in_the_area/,Mountain Biking in the area,/r/Williamsport/comments/tjp44l/mountain_biking_in_the_area/i1phzuq/,2,r/Williamsport,0,2
"Oh wow! I haven't heard of that around here, but I haven't ridden much out of north central PA in a few years..

Mostly I think trail direction here is a matter of practicality, considering elevation changes and features.

"If you want singletrack the pocowanache trail at the water authority is fun. Lots of technical rock gardens with a super fun descent (if ridden counter clockwise, the other way is fun too). The rest of the water authority that is accessible to cyclists is pretty much fire roads, except for part of the racoon mtn trail. If you ride the Poco trail, you'll spend as much time on the fire road to the trailhead as you will on the actual trail though, so keep that in mind. Its a short but steep loop. 

If you have access to a car, bald eagle state forest  (about 25-30 mins)has a lot of great singletrack, though like the water authroity (and just about anywhere in this area) you'll have to do quite a bit of gravel grinding to get from trail to trail, so factor that in to your plans. Or you can make the hour plus drive to rothrock. Way less gravel grinding, much more singletrack.

Check out a purple lizard map for whatever area you'll be riding in, they have all the trails, roads and fire roads well marked with access/use.

Also, trail forks had a lot of the mtb trails mapped out pretty well.

Good luck and have fun, PA has some of the best mountain bike trails I've ridden in the east.",t2_86eh0x6m,RoyGBiv-Devoe,0,1647961238.0,0,t1_i1o2n7b,i1o2n7b,True,sneakylfc,t3_tjp44l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Williamsport/comments/tjp44l/mountain_biking_in_the_area/,Mountain Biking in the area,/r/Williamsport/comments/tjp44l/mountain_biking_in_the_area/i1o2n7b/,3,r/Williamsport,0,3

Montoursville is also solid but the least diverse and it may take awhile to not feel like an outside.,t2_7wymo,BBQingFool,0,1645379187.0,0,t1_hxq7ggb,hxq7ggb,True,epichp1,t3_sx3glr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Williamsport/comments/sx3glr/school_districts/,School Districts?,/r/Williamsport/comments/sx3glr/school_districts/hxq7ggb/,12,r/Williamsport,0,12

"I think Williamsport has been s-l-o-w-l-y climbing out of the hole Mayor Jessie Bloom put us in. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me that more people had smaller minds back then due to the criminals she allowed into the city. Taxes had to be raised, police presence lowered, taxpayers moved out because of the crime, taxes were raised to compensate and the spiral continued. She was a tremendous POS for the city.

20 years later, the city started to pull itself out of that hole and it‚Äôs been an uphill but steady battle since then. The last 10 years seem to have been great for pockets like downtown. I would not think about issues like racism, a cultural war or a class war existing. I‚Äôm sure there are areas and humans still thinking that way‚Ä¶no different than anywhere else. Stay away from crime ridden neighborhoods and you‚Äôll be fine. People are blue collar, work hard and seem to just want to get home to their families.

"For the most part it's like small town NJ. 

I work from home and I'm from NJ originally. 

When you find things you enjoy embrace them. The pandemic has made some stuff way harder to do.

I think the important part of any move is to find people who are like minded. It makes any move easier when you have friends. Harder right now because of the pandemic. 

You need to learn people don't rush here. If you buy, make sure you get at least two different inspectors to come out. The older homes here seem to have so many problems that they try to pass off as normal. 

Also they don't love to take care of snow and ice in the winter. Having 4 wheel drive is best.

There seem to be a lot of chain places but you really need to search to find mom and pop places to eat and shop. 

Pajama factory is only open for events right now. 

In some areas it's more convenient than where I lived in Jersey. More access to grocery stores and gas stations. Easier to get to things. Its close to hiking but alot of the parks are still at least a 30 min to 1 hour drive.

"The State College area, home of Penn State University, offers the most cultural amenities in the region. They have many college sports teams, student and touring theater productions, concerts, and community events through the year. The State College area also has a low crime rate, and good public schools. 

Lewisburg is smaller, but quieter, than Stare College. Bucknell University is in Lewisburg which ensures cultural opportunities in a small town setting. It‚Äôs also an easy drive to the Harrisburg area. Lewisburg is an easy drive to Williamsport. 

Danville is a nice small town in central PA, and is home to a very large hospital, Geisinger. It‚Äôs near to Bloomsburg which is home to a small University. Danville is an easy drive to Lewisburg and Williamsport. 

Williamsport itself is an inexpensive town that has been declining in population since the middle of the twentieth century. It is located on the west branch of the Susquehanna, which is a beautiful landscape. Compared to other towns in central Pennsylvania, Williamsport has limited cultural opportunities, though they do exist. Unless you have family in the Williamsport area, or a job there, you should look at one of the other three areas of Central Pennsylvania that I‚Äôve suggested.

The locals are, for the most part, conservative, I have worked with the majority of them in my career here. However, there are great people here with an open mind and very friendly. My wife and I with our kids go to the downtown local farmers market on Saturdays and people are nice and helpful down there. 

Most of the gas business has left, but there are still gas workers here and there as the industry has considerably slowed down from where it was 10 years ago. There aren't any concerns with health or environmental issues as far as I am aware. 

I don't find Williamsport to be boring at all. It's just really what you make of it. There are plenty of great restaurants, breweries, and places to go to in town. The area has an [arena](https://thelibertyarena.com/) with bowling, laser tag, games, and even batting cages, as well as an indoor bar/restaurant.

"I feel like a lot of people have this idea of Williamsport that formed in the 90s and never changed. Boring is definitely subjective. This area is great if you like the outdoors.

There‚Äôs a fair sized art scene and it‚Äôs rare there isn‚Äôt some happenings locally. 

The gas workers have slowed down, and also weren‚Äôt so much of an ‚Äúissue‚Äù in Williamsport as the surrounding areas imo. 

From my experience everyone is nice, I‚Äôve lived in the area but not in Williamsport until I was in my 20s and my neighbors were all friendly. I even had two stop while I was unpacking to welcome me.

"If you read the Webb Weekly or the Williamsport Sun-Gazette you will see that the city is very conservative. However, most people only express these views in the newspapers and online. I have seen some protestors on the Market Street Bridge.

The gas industry does not have a noticeable presence. I think its impact on the housing market is over.

Williamsport is a very boring. Not much happens here. There is tour bus service to NYC with a trip once a month but the pandemic put an end to my travels. Fortunately the bus company is still hanging on. We have a grand theater worthy of Broadway but they only put on the most boring touring shows.

The Pajama Factory is a cool arts center where many artists have their studios. There is an art gallery. There aren't as many public events as I would like, but they try.

There are almost unlimited hiking options if you are willing to drive around and find the trails.

"5G is less important now than it will be in the next 1-2 years, but the way that cellular networks work is that the providers must license radio spectrum from the FCC.

If you‚Äôre looking at 100% pure performance at this very second in every single square mile possible, Verizon is probably the better choice, but you‚Äôll have dead zones on any carrier.

"It‚Äôs much much closer to Verizon now than you‚Äôd think. Verizon‚Äôs 5G coverage in this area is hilariously bad, T-Mobile has great 5G coverage here, although it‚Äôs about as fast as Verizon‚Äôs LTE, or slightly faster. T-Mobile will also probably become the better choice over time, as their FCC spectrum licensing is probably the best of the three going forward for 5G. 

Naturally 5G should have more capacity than LTE. I would say T-Mobile and Verizon are about equal around here now, ATT being noticeably worse than both others. Xfinity is slightly worse than postpaid Verizon, and the other prepaid carriers than run off of the big 3 are going to be worse than their parent providers. I‚Äôve had Mint as well and it was good, but their ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù plan is actually 35GB and then it becomes unusable. I‚Äôd recommend Mint over Xfinity and T-Mobile over Verizon, but neither are bad choices in this area and price is ultimately going to be the decider.

"Race:  Williamsport lacks diversity, but it is so much worse as you move farther away to the surrounding towns.   If you are non-white, I would stay in Williamsport.    One thing that I've learned from my non-white friends and their spouses is they would never live in any of the surrounding areas.

Depending if you are a liberal, or believe in vaccinations/science, this might bother you, but you will find that most people (Trumpers) here don't believe in science,  are really into conspiracy theories, the election is stolen, etc., so it's hard to respect them as people and make any connections with them (but they feel that way as well towards liberals as well).   This really wasn't an issue for me in the past with republicans as I knew a lot of them, but Trump has changed all of that.

There are still plenty of democrats or pro-science people, and some non-Trump republicans to make connections with so it's not that bad.    The real problem with the heavy Trump population is that policies (public schools for example) are based on their ideologies...so it has been incredibly frustrating for people that I know who have kids here.

Culture and Art:  There is some, but if you care a lot about it you will need to drive a few hours to find it.

Music:  surprisingly much more than you would expect, but limited in terms of variety.

Food and places to go: Depending on where you lived in the past, the lack of things to do or places to visit will bother you.   I lived in towns with very diverse populations, so what bothers me the most is that there is nothing to do here, no places to shop, and no good restaurants unless you only care about American food.   The few international foods that exist here (mexican, sushi, indian, thai) are so underwhelming we only eat them when we are desperate.

There are no Korean, (real) Chinese, or Vietnamese restaurants unless you want to travel a few hours.  There is a Japanese/Hibachi place, but it is a joke and their sushi is just sad.  The few ""high-end"" restaurants are again, sad.

There is one  eating experience that is honestly almost on par in terms of variety and quality with some of the best restaurants I've been in, but it is a pop-up restaurant and they only do takeouts on Saturday afternoons/nights.  They change their entire menu every couple of weeks.  It is the only true culinary highlight here.

" I think that is a lot of white privilege right there. I wish I could bury my head in the sand and think it's all rainbows and unicorns out there.

"Because it's tiresome.  And also I disagree with the sentiment.  In my neighborhood for instance, for every trump sign there are at least 4 houses with ""racism has no home here"" signs.  A couple have one of each.  Plus there are numerous minority and mixed households all around.  It's imagined oppression,  and its denigrating an people for a political leaning...and that's dumb.  Just as dumb as saying something like all democrats are socialists and hate America.  I just get tired of political tribalism, on both sides.  OP asks about if Williamsport is a good place to live.  Voting demographic is like the least important consideration.  I don't think it's fair to paint a liberal or a conservative with a single brush.  People in this community are more nuanced than that.

"Consider Hughesville my hometown, feel free to ask specifics. Guessing ads or Kelloggs for that sort of move.

I just left the area again but the last two years there it's noticeably trumpeted unfortunately.  There are good people too, and I have several friends in the area still, but the poison definitely has hold there. I can't think of any physical actions taken as far as hate crimes. Mostly assholes watching fox news with minimal exposure to other worlds.

I was in Midlands last year for a wedding(actually got there the night of the election) and it felt comparable from a political ratio sort of way. Still pulling for fetterman.

 That said, probably still better to be Asian than black in the boonies. Might get the occasional glances, especially at first, but after you get to know people I don't think you'd have any issues. Talk to people, sports, restaurants, work whatever, show them you're also a human. 

As others have said great base area for outdoors trips.

For school districts I'd suggest Hughesville, loyalsock, montoursville, and honestly Muncy isn't terrible from what I know, just meh. Sock and montoursville 10/15 mins from Muncy, Hughesville 5.

Lewisburg is a nice little town with Bucknell based there, but about 40ish minutes from Muncy. 

Larger hospitals are in Williamsport(upmc with 3) and Danville(geisinger), but Muncy has a smaller one with an ER(generally reviled) and a second is building(one for each of the aforementioned corporations).

There is some music to be found friday-sunday. Bars have some bands(often just classic rock covers but some decent stuff occasionally).

Couple of decent breweries between Williamsport and Lewisburg. Penn state is a religion for some. Actual religion is dying off somewhat as everywhere, but definitely still some old school vibes and a fair after church restaurant crowd. Go to Kathy's in Hughesville. The Greek place in Muncy (misnomer of main street grille) is actually decent. There actually are some decent restaurants in the area. Not a wide selection though. 

Pretty much everything but bars is closed by 10, last call at 2. 

Bonfires and some cookouts in the summer. Take kayaks down to the susquehanna or Ricketts. Hike worlds end or go pick strawberries. There's a stable that gives lessons 5 minutes from Muncy if the kids were interested. 

Muncy and Hughesville are small towns. So is Lewisburg but with a larger footprint due to Bucknell and a decent 'Downtown'. Montoursville is small towny but with the Walmart and close to Williamsport. I still don't really know where loyalsock is(though yes I know technically) as it kind of blends in between montoursville and Williamsport on either side.

Muncy mall is dead but they keep shocking it with the aed. If you never go inside you won't be disappointed. Target's near it though.

""Golden strip"" in sock is a couple of different shopping plazas together, giant(h.e.b.), red lobster, dmv, five guys, veterinarian and couple of doctor offices sort of thing. Usually either the strip, Walmart, or downtown williamsport(kohls/3rd and 4th street stores) for any nongrocery shopping.  Lewisburg has a seasonal farmers market, Muncy has a newish mennonite(?) Grocery store with one of the better produce selections. Wegmans in Williamsport is a decent grocery store, regional cheaper whole foods kind of thing.

Rent should be lower than you're used to. Haven't eyeballed real estate in years there but if you're over 200k it better be perfectly move in ready or have 10 acres.

Last winter we had some decent snowfall. Got one then a bigger one hit(or vice versa) and it actually stayed on the ground for close to a month i believe. That was the closest to a real winter in some years. But somehow some of the guys I worked with still claim global warming is a slowly occurring natural process(wtf). Yes there once was an ice age and the world heated up. 

No that time it did not occur across 200 years you seemingly intentionally ignorant dumb fucks, it took over 2 million years to accomplish what you are saying is natural. Rarely drops below 20 anymore. Maybe mid 20s for January and February. Has been staying chilly a little longer though, into May at least can drop into the 40s at night(spitballing anecdotal) then fall can seem to stretch into December.

Montoursville is also a small town. I recently checked out its main street and I must admit it has a better selection of business establishments than I suspected, with some nice restaurants. 

Williamsport is a small city. There are not many things to do. Before the pandemic you could take bus trips to NYC. This was an all day ordeal since it takes 4 hours to drive to NYC but it was affordable and convenient. The Pajama Factory is a cool place with many artist studios.

If you are willing to drive pretty far there are more things to do and see like the Pine Creek Gorge (the Grand Canyon of PA). Jim Thorpe is a popular tourist town with an excursion train. State College has a botanical garden and does a big art show in the summer.

But Williamsport isn't too bad, as long as you like the outdoors, Pine Creek is a really undervalued scenic area in my opinion. Small but nice Americana food scene, some but not much if you want some ethnic options.

Not sure age of children but Williamsport school district is so-so and middle of the pack for local school districts, but definitely more diverse than any of the other options. If you want the best, definitely look at Loyalsock, they always rank way higher than anybody else. Also, if school districts are BIG deal for you, if also take a look at Lewisburg, small college town south of Muncy about the same distance as Williamsport is, but great school district.

"What kind of food are you looking for? Does it have to be in city limits?

Don Patron if you're into Mexican. Usually pretty heavy handed with the tequila in the margaritas.

For bar type food you can't go wrong with either the Crippled Bear or The Brickyard. If you want to drive a little bit further you could head to Muncy and hit up Haywood's which puts a Pittsburgh style flair to their food.

Hana is an asian bistro. They do sushi, chinese etc... Order off the hibachi menu for a show to go along with your food.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"I am replying because you seem like a genuine person with real opinions on this. Its great to see people having conversations about this stuff. 

Black Lives Matter is a plea. It's asking for consideration and equality. There is very real and recent history of slavery, segregation, and denial of citizenship of black people in the US.

These shirts are an attempt to minimize and downplay the simple request for fair treatment. They are not showing solidarity with black people, they are separating themselves from black people, disregarding their request for fair treatment, and making light of a very real and very recent history of unfair treatment. At best, the people in this photo are ignorant. At worst, they are the modern arm segregationist, racist.

You're right - they are not preventing anyone from pointing out systemic racism. They are, however, sending a string message that they don't care and that they are not afraid to say they don't care.

"When you get to the first parking lot you stop there. Good idea to check in. I can‚Äôt give you cardinal directions here because I don‚Äôt remember. Anyhow, you‚Äôll see there is one obvious main trail is you‚Äôre driving in - don‚Äôt go on that one. Walk up hill and to the left in the parking lot and you‚Äôll find a smaller biking trail. Take that trail up hill, it gets narrow at parts and at one time you‚Äôll come to an open field for a period of time, maybe 100yds, you‚Äôll then re-enter the woods. Continue to follow the trail - it stays fairly dense but then will suddenly fairly clearly open up and you‚Äôll walk on the low side of a parallel ridge on your left. You‚Äôll walk through lots of massive, very old white pines. The foundation will be on the left as you approach this way.

"I used to rent a 1 bedroom apartment in this building. It was a great location for me as it was relatively quiet, yet 2 minutes from downtown where you'll want to be for most of the best restaurants, bars, entertainment, and cultural opportunities in the area. My fiance and I lived there for about 18 months and never had any issues. We frequently played tennis at nearby Brandon Park or went on walks/runs in the Vallamont hills. This building is also nearby several of the best gyms in the area such as the YMCA and Fitness Factory. 

As others have suggested it is ""safer"" in areas such as South Williamsport or Loyalsock, but that's the trade off for living closer to the city and having more at your fingertips. Trouble will find you wherever you live if you go looking for it.

"That's awesome!!
I've done things like soft-mod a console (like the Wii for example) to have Homebrew, which is an app that allows you to install emulators on the device.

I've considered getting a pi and jamming it into an old Gameboy casing with a mini IPS screen.
