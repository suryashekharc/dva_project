All three of the clinics above are top notch and I've taken my own animals to both Companion and Westosha for very sensitive care situations. I particularly can not recommend Companion enough.

"If you don't mind a bit of a drive, Country Vet Clinic (Dr. George) in Burlington is the best I've ever been to.  He's not expensive at all (think $400 for an EKG when everyone else charges $600-$1200).  Current patients can contact him at home after hours for emergencies.  He's taken my call at 2am on a Sunday when I thought my dog had bloat.  He literally saved my cat's life - putting in a feeding tube and giving emergency care (that bill was $144).

He won me over about 10 years ago when he got on the floor on his back and examined my dog like he was a mechanic sliding under a car because my dog was too feisty to get on the table.  He talks to them like they're family, is super gentle, and will take as long as you need to understand and be comfortable.

In addition to that, there needs to be more of a Community Policing culture rather than a Cops-as-Paramilitary culture. That would mean more training from the Police Chief down to the academy cadet. Also, the Sheriff Dept and Police Dept would have to learn to decline ""gifts"" from the federal government in the form of surplus military equipment which bolsters the military mindset.

"I used to do criminal defense work in the area. KPD honestly terrifies me with how violent and vindictive they are. It's made so much worse by how the DA's back them up on everything, rather than serving as a legal check and balance as they should. The judges always rule in their favor, too. A right only exists if a remedy is enforced after it's been violated, and Kenoshans do not have rights.

A cop enters your house without a warrant and orders you to drop your legal gun. When you don't do it fast enough, you're charged with Resisting. Surely your 4th and 2nd amendment will protect you? Not in Kenosha.

A cop starts a voluntary contact, and acknowledges that it's voluntary. You leave, he charges you with fleeing. Surely there's no probable cause to support the stop, let alone a criminal charge? Not in Kenosha.

"> In Monday night’s forum organized by WGTD, Kerkman seemed to suggest that Kenosha County was spending $21 million annually to keep Brookside afloat.

This isn't even hard to get answers on, [here's](https://www.kenoshacounty.org/DocumentCenter/View/12926/2022-County-Budget) the county 2022 budget which includes year-to-date expenditures and projected through year end for 2021 and what the county budgeted for 2022.

The projection is currently at ~$19.1m in costs and ~$15.4m in revenues for 2021, leaving an estimated shortfall of $3.6m. Revenues are down from 2020, but that isn't really a cause for concern *immediately*. The fact the county is budgeting for net even costs and revenues for 2022 suggests that they are optimistic that operations will return to normal through 2022. 

If revenues stay down, then the County will probably start asking tough questions about what services will need to be reduced or if positions need to be reduced, but one down year in a pandemic does not fiscal mismanagement make. I don't see Kerkman for a line by line review of law enforcement budgets, despite them being the largest non-capital component of the county budget, so why complain about a largely revenue-neutral service the county provides?",t2_oivpf,viewtyjoe,0,1644356713.0,0,t1_hw50r9t,hw50r9t,True,RM7985,t3_snt8ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenosha/comments/snt8ix/important_info_regarding_brookside_and_the/,Important info regarding Brookside and the upcoming election,/r/Kenosha/comments/snt8ix/important_info_regarding_brookside_and_the/hw50r9t/,14,r/Kenosha,0,14

While there is no requirement for the questionnaire, there is a requirement for documentation of campaign finance; a questionnaire returned by a candidate to an org that says ""yes, I would like to seek an endorsement"" qualifies as that documentation.

"So a few things.... The house has to be in his name before he can evict you, probate takes ages so there's a good chance the house is still owned by the deceased. It's usually a slow process. Secondly, each lease is different but your lease may have a clause about the house transferring ownership and how it effects the lease. Looking up the home owner is easy, that's available through the county website. The Wisconsin circuit court access website will have information about the deceased's probate case, that's easy to look up.  If you need help understanding your lease, I'm happy to help.


Added: though I suppose the deceased's estate might be able to evict you before the deed changes hands, that seems doubtful but probate court is weird.",t2_4b8ll,peace_core,0,1643256853.0,0,t1_huea65e,huea65e,True,ErnestT_bass,t3_sdnhqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenosha/comments/sdnhqe/landlord_hire_a_lawyer_to_nullify_my_lease/,Landlord hire a lawyer to nullify my lease,/r/Kenosha/comments/sdnhqe/landlord_hire_a_lawyer_to_nullify_my_lease/huea65e/,2,r/Kenosha,0,2

You say you have a lease? Is it a one year lease or month to month? If it is month to month usually there is a 60 day period ( I  do not know Wisconsin law) Was there something in the writen agreement ( assuming there is one) that says he can break lease if he sells the home? Above all do not panic. Ask to have his lawyer send you correspondance you you can see exactly what he is requesting. No one likes the meter running on legal fees. You can continue to negotiate rightr up to the court date.

Asiana is the best Asian food in the area. Korean inspired asian fusion. Everything I've ordered here has been phenomenal.

Maple Table might be a touch overpriced but their breakfast is second to none. Favorites are breakfast burrito and their pancakes are the best I've ever had.

Taejavus was a sleeper but the food is phenomenal. Loved their Cajun Alfredo. PoBoy sandwich was awesome as well. Definitely comfort food.

"Gerharts; hands down best authentic German/Bavarian food outside of Chicago and Milwaukee. Even their rouladen is almost as good as Omas. Best place IMO to get a steak or nicer meal in town.

Mars Cheesecastles deli is by far my favorite lunch spot. Coffee Pot, Daily Dose (beef sandwich is to die for), and Ron’s always gets honorable mention. Can’t forget Danny’s either. All of them are a great option for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. 

Best Chinese I’ve ever had… Yees Oriental Inn downtown. Their food is fresh and delicious. Their homemade buns are a must have with any meal. My fav is the kungpao chicken; it is spicy with big slices of jalapeño so caution if you aren’t into the heat. Family owned for decades, the current owner is just a nice person period.

Pimmys Thai is also bomb. Their coconut soup.. omg. 

Ron’s place has the best burger and their Italian fries with ketchup, yessir.

Burrito taco king is newer. We’ve eaten there 4-5x and I highly recommend the fluata dinner. I hope they last bc their food is great.

On January 21st, 2022, at 5:56 AM, Kenosha
County deputies, detectives, and Fire/Rescue
personnel from the Village of Somers
responded to the 1500 block of Sheridan
Road for a serious vehicle crash. Initial

rate of speed, crossed into the northbound
lanes, and crashed into the east ditch line.
The vehicle struck several obiects before
flipping onto its roof, caught fire, and ejected
the front seat passenger.
According to detectives on scene, the
operator of the Buick, a 28-year-old man
from Racine, WI sustained minor injuries.
The
front-seat passenger, a 29-year-old woman

"Not sure their status since COVID hit, but I absolutely love Renzo's. Cash only, old school Italian trattoria.

Los Cantaritos also rips, super good and reasonably priced Mexican food (carryout and DoorDash only as of now).

A smaller, often overlooked pizza place is Pa's Pizza. Genuinely my favorite in town.

For breakfast, don't overlook Hillcrest. Classic Greek restaurant, but The Coffee Pot is my favorite for breakfast (Franks is a touch overrated imo, but still very good).

For cheap as hell bar food, Ron's Place is the spot. Long ass wait times, but their long islands are the shit.

"Not too many apartments (or rentals in general) west of the I, although there are some. Bristol Bay is a nice townhouse/condo development by the County Center and I have heard of people renting directly from owners there. There are some house rentals and small apartment buildings in Paddock Lake, and a couple larger apartment complexes on Hwy 83 in Salem. A couple small apartment buildings ""in town"" in Bristol also, but you'll probably pay a little extra to be in that school district. You're going to be kind of far from most things in any of those towns though; I lived in a rental in Paddock Lake for a handful of years growing up, and I don't plan to ever live there again. 

Is the desire to live outside of city limits just because you like rural areas, or are you worried about crime/riots/etc? Because the crime in Kenosha really is not too bad. The Blake/Rittenhouse ordeal is not a typical occurrence and could have happened in half the cities in America, honestly. The conditions that led to it are hardly unique.

ETA: you'd probably have better luck finding rural or rural-esque rentals in Somers/around Parkside, and then you also wouldn't be so far from everything in town.

"The utterly moronic nurse at 16:50 is unfortunately not a rarity. My wife is a nurse and the stories she tells me regarding conversations she has with co-workers is haunting. It’s unreal to me how many nurses believe gut feelings or rhetoric that directly contradicts their training. On top of that, it’s terrifying how many facilities aren’t reporting their cases and how many nurses in them are allowed to work while positive because of staffing shortages. She works for two different agencies that sends her all over and she constantly has nurses just randomly admitting they are currently positive in light conversation like it’s no biggie what-so-ever. They are often maskless during their admission. None of these facilities value their safety, nor that of the patients. Almost every one she has gone to has told her they are out of PPE and just to handle Covid patients with her personal cloth mask. After she looks them dead in the eye and replies, “No PPE, no contact”, they always are able to suddenly present her with the proper PPE they were just out of a moment ago. This happens at every location.
