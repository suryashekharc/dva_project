Bloosurf - don't know their exact area of service, it might be expensive and I don't know anyone who uses it to tell you good or bad. super helpful! sorry.

T-Mobile - they have a fairly new service where you get your internet over the 5g network. It's like 50/month. I know someone who was in on it early and they seem to like it. I was tempted because it's so much cheaper than stupid Comcast, but I have concerns about reliability and bandwidth because I work from home.

"Seconding Heron Point in Chestertown. 

Almost all of my family has worked there at some point in their lives. Other than them turning a bit more corporate in the past few years (which really only changed things for staff), they are absolutely fantastic. They always seem to go above and beyond for holidays, including a HUGE Christmas tree and everyone seems to genuinely care about the people there. 

Heron Point is very expensive and cares for some of the wealthier and successful people in the area. Personally, I love that in many cases, a brief paragraph is written about each of the residents (generally accompanied by a picture) about their lives. It really prompts the workers and other residents to make connections with them, as an individual. 

I have also heard pretty good things about Atria in Salisbury and have heard GREAT things about John B. Parsons in Salisbury. John B. Parsons is actually run in a historic building and is absolutely beautiful. Residents are treated more as guests in a luxury hotel and every effort is made to maintain their pride, even when the situation makes that a bit difficult.

I ride the Chester, so I hit the dock bars nearby by boat. On the Chester,  Rolphs is fun. The is a beached shell of a boat.  I'd boat in.   In  Kent Narrows,  lots of tourist-y options.  Big Owl's is fun.  Jetty,  Big Owl's and Redeye all have live music on weekends.  If you like hanging with biker and strippers masquerading as a bikini contest on Sundays,   Redeye is what you are looking for.   Jetty  has a nice large bar, but gets crowded.   Head over to Rock Hall, and you've got about six or so to choose from.

Suicide Bridge is a great setting in the middle of nowhere.  I drive there.

Victory Garden has a good brunch with Bloody Mary bar.  Rams Head Shore House also has a bottomless blood mary bar for $10, and decent breakfast.

Evolution in Salisbury

Burley Oaks, Berlin

RAR,  Cambridge

Easton Shore Brewery,  St. Micheals (seen some great local bands here)

Bull & Goat, Centreville.

Then return to Queenstown, or fit in one more stop to Cult Classic.

Ocean City is about 2 hours away - you will learn to hate the bridge traffic

"Get on the island and drive as south as you can go, deep into the federal side, near the off road section. There's a small lot and a nature walk out amongst the dunes. Go there. Follow the old road until it just kinda stops waaay the hell out there. Harrison's harborwatch restaurant has giant floodlights pointed at the inlet, and the carnival atmosphere of the boardwalk gives off a tremendous glare. You should be far enough away if you go down to the south dunes. 

The bigger issue, however, is humidity and ocean haze. Sometimes it's just so muggy you can barely see the moon, never mind the stars. But other nights... you can see the Milky Way with the naked eye.

As the other poster said, I'd bring binoculars rather than a telescope. Maybe you wanna grab a cheapo ""my first astronomy kit"" kind of telescope. 

One last recommendation; study constellations and the myths around them before you head out. Nothing's cooler than Dad knowing that kinda stuff off the top of his head. For example, the star marking the head of the constilation ""Cygnus"" has historically been called ""the eyes of Cygnus."" Emphasis on the plural.

"So the sports complex is where the trail starts. After you pass all of the backyards there is a beautiful wooded canopy and a bridge over a little stream. Then you end up approaching Goldsboro and the old train station. It’s more urban from there unless you walk way far down. They’re expanding the trail on the far end I hear. My dad works for the town of Easton so I get updates from time to time. Anyway, here’s another map that might help you find the trailhead. Good luck!

**Fresh seafood.** I am not so big on seafood, but most places around here sadly import most of their seafood. I see lots of seafood trucks roll into St. Michaels. I think that if you want the good stuff (namely crabs) your best bet is a place that buys seafood from the locals like Lindy's in Woolford or Kool Ice in Cambridge. Dorchester County is a bit of a drive away, but that's where most watermen live, work and sell seafood, from what I've seen. Hopefully someone knows a place in Talbot Co to get fresh local seafood. I would like to know too :P

**Food.** If you are going to be here on Thurs, Fri or Sat the Amish Country Farmers Market is just damn good food. Check their schedule.  Don't skip it!!! If you want more views and some driving check out Suicide Bridge Restaurant in Secretary, MD. Views are great, food and service not superb but OK, but of a drive.  Also can recommend The BBQ Joint in downtown Easton and Crepes by the Bay in Saint Michaels. Both pretty good. Trappe is not a good food destination however. 

**Pubs.** In Easton, the pub is Washington Street Pub, food lunch and snacks, check out Pint Night if you want local IPAs.  In St. Michaels you have Carpenter Street Saloon, good breakfast there too.

**Museums.** Since you are going to the Crab Claw, you will find the Maritime Museum directly adjacent. Can't miss it. There's also the Academy Art Museum in downtown Easton, never been. We also have a theater in Easton, the Avalon.

**Views.** Walk around downtown Easton or St Michaels. Easton is really pretty and historic, if you like bricks, plaques, and trees. Take the back roads in St Michaels by the Miles River. They have some pretty Colonial houses.

**Live music.** There is a place called Brasserie Brightwell in Easton. Never been there but they seem to have bands frequently playing there on the weekends.

**Oysters on an airplane.** I am inclined to say no :(

Hope that gives you some ideas, you caught me while I was bored, lol :P Just don't miss the Amish market!",t2_56bnc,ictu0,0,1506547496.0,0,t1_dnlk9qu,dnlk9qu,True,belinck,t3_72u501,https://www.reddit.com/r/easternshoremd/comments/72u501/going_to_be_in_the_easton_area_for_work_next_week/,Going to be in the Easton area for work next week,/r/easternshoremd/comments/72u501/going_to_be_in_the_easton_area_for_work_next_week/dnlk9qu/,7,r/easternshoremd,0,7
"Oyster season starts on October 1st, so youre right on time! Easton has some good restaurants, and the Avalon Theater usually has some good music lined up. The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St Michaels is a great day trip. 

And unless you have a very, very cold cooler to put the oysters in, dont even bother trying to bring them back. Theyll go bad while you wait in the airport, and youll have a nasty time if you eat em.

"Hi, I moved from Glen Burnie to Centreville back in 2000 with my family when i was 6, and I just moved to Easton as a 22 year old, last summer. So i dont really have to much knowledge on life outside of it.  
Centreville itself is very boring. There is a few sports bars and they have some decent events throughout the year. I'm not to sure what interests you have but its the same case as most small towns, there just isn't much to do.  
Now to good thing about Centreville is I have never heard about any murders, robberies or anything like that around there. The school system is ok, the high school wasn't that great but there is Gunston High too. They have a really good Rec sports program and they added a 2nd park off of 18. Before people fought over the fields.  

In general i enjoyed growing up there, the people are friendly so as long as you go out and do stuff. I personally like Easton a lot better.

"Grad student here. If I can get by on my joke of a salary (and I hope you make far, far more), I think you'll be ok. Rent at a decent apartment complex (of which there are a few in Salisbury, but there are many more terrible ones like Parkside Apts. - so do your homework if you are planning on an apartment) is kind of pricey, my husband and I paid about $850 for a one bedroom, I think a 2 bedroom is in the $950+ ballpark.

As someone else suggested, if you are looking to buy a home, the Delaware state line is literally 5 minutes from North Salisbury. Many people seem to live in Delaware and commute to Salisbury and even further South.

In terms of stuff to do, Salisbury does have a surprising amount of stuff going on. It's not like Philly, but for a town of ~35,000 it's doing pretty well. The zoo someone else mentioned is free and is attached to some nice walking trails. Evolution Craft Brewery is like the best thing to hit Salisbury ever. Good food, good beer and fabulous specials that make it affordable even on a budget. We have a beer fest and a wine fest every fall and Third Friday takes place downtown every month, often with free live music and entry into the Salisbury University downtown art gallery.

Plus, when the weather is nice, Assateague (or Ocean City depending on what kind of beach you like) is close by.

I think the hardest thing for me, when I first moved here, was finding people to do all these things with. I suggest finding an organization to volunteer with to get started with meeting people.

"If you're looking to buy property, think about locating in Delaware just north of Salisbury.

Even in this day and age of smartphones and pagers we still use the Fire sirens to alert us as a fail-safe in the event those don't work. I'm not familiar with how Denton operates but if they run the siren like my company does it will sound for any ""alarm"" as it's called, car crashes, structure fires, etc. Unfortunately that means it will blow at 3 am on a sunday morning when you're trying to sleep in, but from my knowledge Denton isn't particularly busy when it comes to alarms so you shouldn't have to worry much.

"I must have written and deleted three responses trying to say this without sounding like a jerk, but it's hard because it's kind of a dick thing we do out here.

You're not a local, and you can't ever be. In most of America, you move to Ohio or Vermont, you buy a house and bam, you're a local. But out here... we're few, we're slow, we're insular, we're tight knit. And we've had *tons* of people coming in from Pennsylvania and Over-The-Bridge in the last two decades.

We're a people whose family names are on tombstones that are nigh on four hundred years old. We've got our own customs and our own squirrelly accent. And those customs and that accent is dying out. The culture of the Shore is dying; it can't survive the dilution it's getting and anyone who can see lightning and hear thunder knows it. Everyone feels that profound loss, that impending doom when the last chicken-farming mustard-eater turns off the lights on their way out.

So 'local' has become the last refuge, a shibboleth, a code word for 'I am a part of that which is dying before my eyes.' And most people'll get all bent out of shape if you try to make that claim, even after a decade of raising a family here.

"It's verrrrrrrryyyyyyyy slooooowwwwwww.

People speak their minds here.

They are friendly but reserved, it takes a couple of years for them to open up, since everyone already knows each other. 

You have to watch your behavior bc you are always running into people you know. I see my neighbors everywhere. 

It's a real community..people do really care about their community, enough to try to preserve their way of life, as difficult as it is. Watermen everywhere. 

There are no big box stores here. You are forced to buy local, the big exceptions being Safeway and Kmart. If you want to go to target or Walmart you'll have to drive awhile. This is fine with me.

There's a fresh farm stand directly across from Safeway, so everyone goes there in the spring/summer/fall for produce and eggs.

If you want to get anything done, it's best to talk to someone directly. Don't call them, they hate talking on the phone. 
It can be annoying to have to drive 10 miles to talk to someone when it really could have been done on the phone.

Another thing is that as soon as you get over the bridge you have gone back 30 years. Helicopter parenting is rare in my neighborhood. 
Kids just play. 

People smoke around their kids. Rarely do the kids  wear helmets when riding bikes or skateboards, and I regularly see kids riding in cars without boosters.

Phoenix Rising is better than they were anyway, but Illusions was bigger, so they had more of a selection. They're in the Twiley Center, so it's not to big, but they are planning to expand once the lease is up. 

They do FNM and have HeroClix tournaments every Wednesday. I've seen some guys playing Pathfinder on Monday's. The guys who run it are all super nice and chill. Really knowledgeable too. I'm never able to play and Magic there since I'm always at work Friday nights. But I've been a few times and it's good. They also do Monday Night Magic (or did, I haven't been in a while.)

">  waterfowl museum lol

It's called the Ward Museum and it's a great place to visit once.

Skip the Salisbury Mall unless you want to visit an indoor strip mall, it, much like the rest of Salisbury has a downtrodden and depressing feel.
I would pass on Brew River, it's nothing to write home about and certainly avoid it at night.

Ocean city has some great places but it has also seen a decline in the atmosphere as more and more people from Baltimore and the surrounding areas flood in. If you go take advantage of the park and ride and ride the bus for $3 all day.

Traffic in St. Mikes will be atrocious, locals know to avoid it in the summer. Cambridge, which is much closer to St. Mikes has several good eateries like High Spot, Stoked, and Jimmy and Sooks.

"Ocean city is like a haven for families.  It has the boardwalk and tourist beaches which have a perfect mix of night life for the older folks and family oriented or even kid geared restaurants, any type of food you want from gyros to pizza to Mexican, all of quality ranging from gourmet to carnival.  The locally famous spots include fractured prune donuts, which is also in Salisbury, Alaska stand had amazing burgers, ponzettis pizza, there are also buffets.  Oc wasabi is an amazing sushi place, and is a personal favorite but more upscale.  The boardwalk also has rides, games and even a museum of ocean city's beach and resort history, uptown there is an art league where local artists are featured year round.  There's also a Ripleys believe it or not.  For candy go to candy kitchen, for fudge go to dolle's.  And no trip to ocean city is complete without a tub of FISHERS POPCORN! Absolutely amazing caramel corn.  There is also assateague island which has beaches too if you're not into the whole tourist beach vibe, and in west ocean city there are more corporate places like chipotle and Outback Steakhouse, but big shout out to SMOKERS BBQ on 611, they have amazing local BBQ.  Emings is further away, located in selbyville Delaware on the corner of 610 and 113.  It features amazing smoked chicken platters, which people come from miles away for.  Get a strawberry pie, and a quarter chicken platter.  Berlin is also close to ocean city and features an amazing downtown with art galleries, beautiful brick faced buildings with a small town feel and awesome mom and pop shops.  A great restaurant there that would please any foodie is called ""the globe"" which features in season foods and a rotating menu to match.

Salisbury has a local decoy museum dedicated to decoys and waterfowl stuff, called the waterfowl museum lol.  The downtown of Salisbury is walking only for some parts and is beautiful decorated with the brick face buildings giving it the same type of feel as Berlin.  A great restaurant downtown in Salisbury is ""the market street inn"" with a great view of the river and downtown areas.  Close by there is also ""brew river"" which features a more seafood oriented menu with similar views of the river.  Salisbury has shopping with a mall, and also has some of the more corporate chain restaurants and stores in the commercial areas.  My absolute favorite food in this area is ""shalimar Indian restaurant and grocery"" which features real Indian food cooked the right way, a big shout out to their naan bread (brick oven cooked) and mango lassi, which if you look in their menu is described as ""best drink"" and it is.  A mixture of mango and yogurt.  Amazing.  Like I said my absolute personal favorite.

Outside of Salisbury down nanticoke road if you are the outdoorsy type that likes to be alone are amazing beaches and parks run by the state,  search for ""tyaskin park"" on the internet.  It features brackish water, views of the mouth of the nanticoke river, and bay, swimming, fishing, canoeing etc.  there is even a boat launch there if you are interested.  Tyaskin would be a great get away from the city, and in the boonies, to give you that quiet.  If you're not satiated by your picnic under the pavilion at the park, there is one restaurant down that way. Coincidentally called ""boonies restaurant and tiki bar"" it has great food and features local seafood.  There is also camping down this way.  There is also another restaurant number 2 of 2 out there called ""the red roost"" which is located in a reconfigured chicken house and has an awesome atmosphere.  

Salisbury has that corporate vibe to it, ocean city is touristy, and that last area tyaskin/nanticoke road is just a laid back area with not many people to take a break from the fast pace of the city.

In both Salisbury and ocean city this time of year there is tons of traffic, which you'll surely be riding in on your way to st. Michaels from dc anyways.

Let me know if I helped or you need anything else : )
