"Fights in schools are nothing new. I speak from first hand experience that going back to full in person learning this year has something to do with an increase in fighting. It’s almost as if they forgot how to problem solve when things come up with peers. The wcsd behavioral matrix that is referenced in the news segment gets loosely followed by administrators. They typically interpret it in their own ways. Bottom line, until the district takes a tougher stance with fighting this is only going to get worse. Side note, it’s a dirty little secret that students on an IEP can not be suspended for more than 10 school days a year. Even if they fight or are violent.

"I am Asian and my spouse is Black, he grew up in Reno and honestly it’s had more downs than ups. If it’s not blatant racism, there’s it’s fair share of micro aggressions. Going to Walmart my spouse constantly gets his receipt checked even when it’s small items. When I go to Walmart alone, I noticeably can tell I do not get my receipt checked as often. We have children together and get stares. Of course, we also run into people who compliment them, which we are grateful for. Reno is definitely getting more diverse and there’s plenty of opportunity within this city. 

All I know is that the way people have treated me here as a single college student vs. the way people have treated me as a mom in an interracial family has been different, so as always, to each their own. Reno has a lot to offer and I think it boils down to where you spend you time/where you eat/shop. I could write novels about the way I notice people treat my family, and I’m so sorry you had to experience something like that out in the hiking trails.

"I’m a big fan of three levels of feedback/reinforcers: negative, neutral, positive. For many middle-school students who struggle with grades, that might look like: 

* Negative: We sat down together to look at your grades on Friday and you had multiple Fs. This means no phone for the week, no PlayStation, and limited time with friends.

* Neutral: We sat down on Friday and you have one F and/or multiple grades below C. This means your phone will be useless during school hours except for calling/texting me (parental control) and PlayStation time is limited. (This is what I would consider baseline rules for a student not excelling.) And you have one week to bring up your grades or we’re dropping to the lower level of privileges.

* Positive: We sat down… nothing below a C. Nice work! You’ll have phone privileges at school, less restricted PlayStation, and get to go to the movies with your friends this weekend (or whatever is motivating and doesn’t break the bank). 

This would obviously be adjusted for a student with behavioral issues (using, say, a daily or weekly note), or for students who are capable of having a higher bar set. 

I’m not a big fan of extra chores or other directly-punitive measures, but prefer a loss of privileges (including grounding* ), *particularly* since some of those privileges are counterproductive. (You ever see a kid with untreated ADHD try to focus on math class instead of their phone?) 

I think that somehow too many parents are trying to make teachers and schools the “bad guys”… and, unfortunately, it’s working exactly as that and nothing more. Congrats: We’re the bad guys. How’s that working out for you? (General, not literal you.) 

Parents need to stop (only) being their children’s friend and cheerleader. We need to be a team again. Takes a village and all that. Schools and teachers can’t be the only ones raising kids. 

\* And you know what? Come to think of it? I haven’t heard a single student complain about “groundation” or the like for three or more years.

"You would rather allow fights continue longer, than to allow a teacher to break one up? 

Okay, well we disagree on this one. 

What's the difference between a resource officer pulling the kids apart and a teacher?

Either way a child has an adult physically put hands on them, to stop a fight. 

\----

To answer your question, The quicker a fight is stopped, the less the kids are injured.  Sure training is great, but even an untrained adult can physically step between kids, or pull one kid out of the fight.

"Why it can be harmful to feed the ducks bread, from the Truckee Meadows Parks Foundation

"Search and Rescue member here who deals and assists with evacuations in fire areas...

1. If you're in a high risk area, aka against brush/sage, create a fire break best you can around your property. Any amount of feet will help. General rule is anything 2x the flame height, and while I don't know the rules behind how tall flames can get given particular burning sources, 10 feet is a good, solid start.

2. We all live in Reno. We all know it's windy as hell. FIRES CAN MOVE AS FAST AS WIND. I watched the Petrilla fire from my home travel literally a mile in 2 minutes when a wind gust hit it. It blanketed the area solid in flame. Don't think that just because it's 2 miles away you have plenty of time to sit around and watch.

3. Speaking of sitting around and watching... Don't do it. Please, when the fire looks like it's going to encroach on your area, get out. When you see flames/close smoke from only one hill over, get your go bag in your car and call your friends/family to crash on their couch. Don't wait for me to come knocking on your door to get out. We're there to make sure you GOT out and mark your house accordingly. That means there is less for the fire department to have to deal with, like trying to help you get out if the fire starts burning your house down. 

4. Remember, if you wait til the last minute, so will have everyone else, and NO ONE will be getting out, especially with how a lot of these wildland urban interfaced developments were built in recent years (1-4 feeder roads out with a TON of close-knit small streets and cul-de-sacs.) These roads aren't meant to handle the massive traffic load of EVERYONE leaving all at once. Also, remember, as you lot are trying to get out, fire apparatus, SAR, Police/sheriff and utilities are trying to get in.

5. Have a go bag ready with all your important documents ready to go. Titles, deeds, insurance forms, medical history items, certificates... All need to come with. Medication, food, water, changes of clothes and other essentials as well, obviously. Our departments are fantastic at keeping fires at bay around here, but sometimes, like 2 years ago November with the fire off McCarren south west, we lost multiple homes that day, some nowhere near the fire line and very inward from where the head of the fire was. Conditions were right for a massive flare up with the dry weather and the strong winds.

6. This is the last bit... We won't always come back to tell you to leave. We come by and give warnings/assistance. Sometimes our warnings are just letting you know hey, there's a fire 5 miles from you and winds are calm... Just letting you know. Other times, the fire will be at your back fence in about 8 minutes, why are you still here in your pajamas? Get OUT. But, even that first scenario, we won't come back and tell you that your fence is on fire because we have other areas to cover.

Hope this helps someone out there. We're here to help. We know that a lot of ya'll know what you're doing, but there are some that...

"It’s definitely harder making friends as you get older.  Older people typically have a network of friends /family that they are plugged into and don’t have a need to expand it.  I had a group that my wife and I were part of for many years and the “Alpha” couple got a divorce.  We didn’t take sides, but we didn’t shun the wife so the husband basically ensured that we were disinvited to every thing.   

We still keep in touch with the others , but not nearly as close.  I had to take an active stance to cultivate a new group of friends.  I had to not only meet them and have beers and such, but also invite them over to dinners, and long weekend getaways.  I had to take the initiative and somehow add value to these folk’s lives which were otherwise already chock full of friends.  It was a lot of work, but fun as well and we now have a good group of friends again.

"Creative feedback, I would consider restructuring this moving forward as “hey it’s tough to meet people outside of work as an adult” or even “I’m looking to meet new people”. The reality is a lot of people deal with what you’re dealing with, but unloading it all on a stranger is probably not an ideal way to kick things off. Some cognitive biases people suffer  from (all people) are the spotlight effect and transparency bias, and the tldr of both is that people are not looking at you and judging you as a “creep” as much as you think they are, and odds are very good that most people can’t even tell you’re lonely or sad. Highly recommend looking these up, making friends becomes a lot easier when you don’t have to worry about other people seeing your innermost thoughts. Just listen to people, label their emotions (look up Chris Voss), and once you know what they care about give them opportunities to talk about it. A fun game to practice is to see how long in a conversation you can go without saying the word I. You seem very focused on yourself and your own flaws, but strangers aren’t and don’t really have any interest in them unless you draw their attention to them. A little painful to hear, but liberating when you can stop stressing about them.
