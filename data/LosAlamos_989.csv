"As a rental: The waitlist can be pretty brutal and there are two (?) apartment companies in town and both are pretty horrible. The good news is that there is decent churn and it isn't too uncommon for someone to rent in Santa Fe and  then move to Los Alamos (or just stay in SF...)

For a house: Pretty hard. Expect to pay over asking and waive all inspections and repairs AND pay a significant chunk of the downpayment in cash. Unless you get really lucky and can buy something off market or take advantage of SF/Espanola realtors not understanding the Los Alamos market and screwing over the seller due to a bad listing.

It also depends on your previous history and types of crimes.

Documented history of lying on paperwork is bad too, like if you are tied to a bunch of creddit and loans in different names without a good explanation, etc.  Context is important as well.

Typically they don't put you in for the clearance until after you start but that could be the same week you start. There is no polygraph for a clearance investigation but if you have additional clearance on top of it (you'd already be Q cleared by that time) you can be subject to a polygraph. I worked in HR but the area I worked in required me to be covered by a special clearance which I got picked for a random polygraph. Was an interesting experience down in ABQ with DOE  but they tell you how to answer and you follow a script then I guess check that what you said wasn't a lie.

I'm not sure how long they go back for an L clearance but a Q is the highest level and they look back all the way. The misdemeanor is nothing to worry about the other one may ping on the clearance check but if they want more information you'll head down to Albuquerque to the DOE office to talk over the details. Even people with felonies not expunged are cleared.  I'm Q cleared and used to go to Grateful Dead shows...that was a long time ago though. I don't know enough about the mental health stuff but know if you are Q cleared you have to report getting counseling to Security but I've never heard of a clearance being denied due to ongoing mental health support.

"Depends on the position. I would assume the job you hired for has a clearance requirement so being denied a clearance would therefore make you unable to do the job and you'd typically be terminated. They would probably try and find an uncleared position if available but they probably won't try too hard. On the bright side if that happens it's not due to your own fault so you won't have to pay back any relocation benefits. If you got far enough to get an offer I'm guessing you don't have any felonies or major red flags (everyone gets a background check) which they'd pull the plug on the offer at that point since you could possibly not be cleared.

"Interesting u/Jackalope_4213  mentioned time loops.  So last rendia story:   A relatively large group of friends were partying behind the sportsmans club in rendia on friday night.  This was early 90s.  It was a usual party I drank a few beers pulled out a sleeping bag and slept in the car.  Its important to note I never did drugs and my parents were involved with their divorce so it was not unusual to not come home all weekend.  I woke up like usual and realized I had no recollection of  where I was exactly.  I was clearly in the north county and I recognized the general horizon having extensively dirtbiked and hiked there but I did not recall driving there.  Further investigation revealed there were also no tire tracks leading from my car  parked slightly off the road in the soft ground.  It was highly unusual.    Car starts and I find my way home.  Only then did I realize it was sunday and no one had seen me since that party.  Complete loss of time from my perspective, kind of freaked me out for a bit.  Never happend again.

"I always take the relief route/599, then (like everyone else) 84 then 502. I think the most direct way to get to the main gate of LANL (where the badge office is) is to go up E Jemez/the truck route off of 502.

Traffic can be dense on the way home, but it hardly ever slows down. One way is about an hour drive.

I have no experience with taking the Park n Ride, but that's an option too. 

Living in that bit of Santa Fe is convenient, because it takes me like 5-10 minutes to get to i-25 (which in an hour will get you to ABQ) and rt 14 (""the turquoise trail"", that drive is beautiful).

Be aware that you'll lose cell service between where 502 and route 4 merge, and Pojoaque/where El Parasol is. Downloading music/podcasts/etc in advance is good.

Various events (precovid) like festivals or concerts during warmer months. Even trivia nights and karaoke! People here aren't quite the hermits it may seem.

The issue is few bars or restaurants, or really anything that stays open past 8pm. Paired with a general age in the area greater then 45, dating is a bit more difficult. And generally meeting people takes a bit of effort.

Lastly, it's important to remember that a good or bad postdoc program is always determined by your ""fit"". i.e. What is your field, and does LANL do good work in that area? do you like the project? do you like your colleagues? are you excited by the future prospects?

There's a postdoc program, also, where you can have the opportunity to meet/socialize with other postdocs, too, which is a good way to make friends in town (and build a professional network of peers).",t2_rnumf,marlinofdoom,0,1643386100.0,0,t1_huliozg,huliozg,True,popegonzalo,t3_sefzin,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/sefzin/how_good_and_competitive_is_lanl_postdoc_program/,How good and competitive is LANL postdoc program?,/r/LosAlamos/comments/sefzin/how_good_and_competitive_is_lanl_postdoc_program/huliozg/,3,r/LosAlamos,0,3

"My son went to [http://www.bilingualmontessorischool.com](http://www.bilingualmontessorischool.com) till he moved to kinder this year. I was very happy with them, and you could tell how much it helped him when he went to school.

I have heard people say it is hard to get into, but we just signed up, not sure if we were lucky or not. It is in White Rock, so depending where you get a house it can be a bit out of the way.

">>My point is that OP doesn’t have to fear being surrounded by tarantulas 24/7 if s/he moves to NM. Tarantulas are here but they’re not a factor in most people’s daily lives.

Yes, I don’t think anyone has tried to say anything otherwise. I’m pretty sure most of us who do encounter them have said they are nothing to worry about. OP, however has a phobia. And phobias are not rational. 

Which, as some have already said to OP to work on.


I don’t think you’ve made a good argument to 
help OP by simply stating you live here and have never encountered them, while not directly responding to OP and saying how AZ has them more. 


A good response would be, hey OP! I live in the urban or outside of LA area (insert where you live). We don’t encounter them. Of course, we can’t say if you will or won’t but here’s some good info on tarantulas and how they behave. 


>>Which is an actual response to the nature of OP’s concerns, as opposed to whatever you’re trying to accomplish by contradicting me.

I’m sorry? Because someone contradicts you is no reason to be an asshole. Your responses were about never seeing a tarantula here. Especially in comparison to AZ. Ok. But, they are here. And depending where you live here, surrounding communities have people who do commute to the lab and we see these special arachnids. 

>>You can move along now, rather than being pointlessly argumentative.

I’m sorry you felt this way. This was definitely not my intention here. I just know, as someone who is living in an outside of LA area, who commutes that the potential of seeing tarantulas is not abnormal.

They run some of the cheaper apartments in town. It might also be easier to get one once you've got a job in LA to show income.

[Canyon Village](https://www.canyonvillagepeakliving.com/) probably isn't affordable any more, but it can't hurt to call and ask. I guess not advertising prices is probably a bad sign...

Good luck!

"Not sure what your opinion is concerning “cheap”. I just moved out of a dog friendly 2bed in an octoplex that was 1,100/mo. Cheapest I’ve seen but it’ll eat almost all your savings in the first months with deposits. I still have the lease on it for a bit but they’ve been showing it like crazy so I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s already spoken for. 

As for job the search, seems like every service type job up here is hiring. Mc,D’s has a start wage of $14/hr posted on the door for a while. 
 
With that in mind, personally, I’d make the 30 minute drive from Espanola if I was already established there. I’d imagine apartments would be cheaper than the cost of fuel, but who can say what the future holds? Another option that might work is Santa Fe and the bus route. $6 I think from Santa Fe and atomic city transit is free in LA.",t2_jakgy,inoticedyouhavepie,0,1642736315.0,0,t1_htjw653,htjw653,True,soggywaffels,t3_s8tox2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/s8tox2/looking_for_cheap_but_nice_apartments/,Looking for cheap but nice apartments,/r/LosAlamos/comments/s8tox2/looking_for_cheap_but_nice_apartments/htjw653/,6,r/LosAlamos,0,6

You do \_NOT\_ want to buy land in any reservation!

Some previous tribal governors have been explicit that it was their intent to drive non tribal members off the reservation and purchase the land at pennies on the dollar.

"It really depends on your field.

&#x200B;

LDRD has always been kind of a safety net for the soft money divisions and kind of ignored by the more weapons adjacent divisions. Which has led to more of an emphasis on the soft money divisions getting people on review boards and engaging and the harder money divisions just ignoring the process entirely. Which, in turn, makes it really hard for a lot of folk to get anyone who can assess their proposal to look at it.

&#x200B;

Then there are some outliers like computer science where it is pretty much an open secret that actually making a CS oriented proposal is a waste of everyone's time. That isn't to say you can't sneak it in but you generally will need ""real"" science or some esoteric applied math to be the overall theme of the proposal. Although, machine learning is a big enough buzz word that I know of two that snuck in that way.

That isn't to say you can't do CS research on LDRD but... you can't do it on paper. If that makes sense.

"If it snowed somewhat heavily recently? Probably the side roads. A good trick is to check the los alamos traffic cameras. if you see snow piled up in the bike lanes on Diamond or Central then you are probably gonna have some slippery side roads.

But, generally speaking, NM has its  shit together with respect to snow (unlike, say, Arizona...). If there is a projected snow then the plows are ready to hit the highways overnight.

To put it in context: a few years back I visited some friends in Phoenix over winter break. I probably almost died about five times on the drive back because highways and interstates were either closed or should be closed. But once I crossed that state border the roads were more or less spotless... but still incredibly bumpy and poorly maintained.

"It really depends on the field/group. I was fortunate enough to get a pretty nice fellowship from the lab so my PD was fully funded. But it was also explained to me pretty early on that if I wanted to get converted I should support activities of interest to the lab, so I was generally 40% ""me time"" and 60% ""helping to lessen the burden on some other project charge codes"". Made converting really easy though since I already had plenty of folk who liked me and wanted me long term. So the moment my fellowship was up I got the offer and still work with a few of the staff members I collaborated with as a PD.

There is the argument that, as a PD, you need to demonstrate self sufficiency. But you also need to show you are worth converting because you will help overall efforts for years to come and people who are already living off LDRD are just a wildard going forward. It is great that you can pay for yourself but what happens when you can't?

I would say to talk with your mentor, other PDs, and even other people on your team. But as a PD you cost basically nothing in terms of hourly rates and overhead so you are probably better off supporting the effort of early and mid career staff.

I would also say that, depending on the field, you might be able to skip the postdoc entirely.

So work with your mentor and get to know them. But also get to know your team/group and even collaborators.

"Yeah. I recently went through the house buying process and only managed to succeed due to a very poorly listed house by a Santa Fe realtor (significantly under list price and even a bit under the comps prices with inspections and remediation by the seller). From speaking with my (los alamos) realtor, the santa fe crowd still somehow don't understand how stupid it is up on the hill.

I genuinely do not understand how that can be possible at this point but... realtors tend to come across as pretty stupid. And I imagine a lot of the santa fe crowd can't be bothered to drive up the hill (my realtor basically coordinated everything because the seller's couldn't be bothered to let repair people in and so forth).

&#x200B;

That said, a house I looked at in white rock that literally had fire and mold damage (it was so bad that the inspector, who I had a chance to talk to because he did the inspection for the house I bought during closing, felt so guilty that he bolded and underlined ""visible microbial growth"" three times to try and get it across that that was mold and he just couldn't legally call it that) and a roof supported by beams of wood went for significantly over list price. So folk are hungry.

&#x200B;

If folk are willing to drive a bit more then the less primo spots in santa fe tend to be a lot more reasonable (aware of a few houses that even sold with FHA loans). But Los Alamos, unless you get really lucky and know the sellers or the sellers are morons, you are going significantly over asking price, waiving inspections, and probably offering to pay in cash any diference between the appraisal and the offer (although, the appraisers are in on it too so you don't have to worry about that).

Of the four houses I am directly aware sold in Los Alamos and know the sellers/""real offers"" of over the past few years: One was right on the threshold of when stuff got really insane and only went for 3% over asking and the realtors were able to explain what the offer would need to be. One basically cleaned out a couple's savings and involved a lot of money from their parents. One was sold off market in exchange for letting the sellers live there until they finished closing on their new house. And one was very much taking advantage of an idiot from Espanola whose realtor failed him.

"I'm a foreign scientist at LANL, working only on open (non-clearance) science, and I'm leaving my scientist 2 job (early career 'permanent' position, right after post-doc) for a tenure track in academia. This is also a throw-away account as I'll still be at LANL until the tenure track starts this summer.  
Most of my early-career friends (foreign or US, 6 of the 7 early career friends I have here) are leaving or making concrete plans to leave, either to industry or to academia.  
The main reason for that is that it is very difficult at LANL to work only on open science, especially as an early-career scientist. Scientist positions at LANL are soft money, meaning you must find your own funding (for all 12 months of the year, as opposed to just 3 in universities).  
Weapons money is plentiful at LANL but money for open science is actually very tight. The result is that scientists who don't 'behind the fence' as some call it here (money that requires a clearance) spend most of their time writing proposals or networking to find money at LANL and/or from DOE.  
To give an example these days there is the competition for the DOE early career award that gives 5 years of funding (12 months of salary + money for 2 postdocs essentially). This is extremely competitive, with 30 to 40 LANL scientists applying every year for usually only 1 to 2 awards. This award is close to a tenure-track in terms of funding (salary + startup package) with no opportunity for tenure afterwards.   
   
I don’t regret coming to LANL at all as it has been amazing for my career, and the many high-profile publications I authored or co-authored here set me up for getting tenure track offers. I would absolutely advise someone to come as a postdoc, just not so much to stay on as a scientist. I am leaving in good terms and will keep strong collaborations with LANL folks, but in my opinion it's very clear that any tenure track (in the US or not) is vastly better than a scientist position at LANL.  
   
If you still want to join LANL, your best bet is to get in touch with the team advertising the job. The typical career as a scientist at LANL starts as a postdoc, during which you start finding your own funding with writing grants. If you join directly as a scientist you'll be joining a well funded project with a specific task within this project, and you'll have the duration of the project (usually 3 years) to set-up follow-up projects of your own or collaborations.   
When a team advertises a job at LANL (postdoc or scientist) there is often already someone in mind, so you should contact the team lead directly, and they'll reply if they're actually looking for someone.   
   
TL;DR: Scientist positions at LANL are soft-money, and working on open science takes spending most of your time writing grants, so you're better off going to academia or industry if you don't want to get into  weapons/clearance-only money.

I should have been more clear that I'm looking for non-clearance jobs which I imagine are a strict subset of non-weapon jobs, rather than implying that all non-weapon jobs are non-clearance. Long story short, I'm a green card holder, so no clearance for me. I don't have anything against weapons work or work that involves a clearance, but the powers that be probably have an issue with me for that kind of work (for at least a few more years before I become eligible for naturalization, that is).

First off, you said this:

>	I should say I’m primarily looking into the non-weapons science jobs, so no clearance jobs

What’s your field? There is *a lot* of non-weapons science research going on at the lab that requires a clearance. For example, see [this page](https://www.lanl.gov/about/leadership-governance/our-customers.php), which says this:

>	The Laboratory does additional work for the Department of Energy Office of Science, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and others.

So, depending on your field, you may actually be perfectly positioned to do some super cool science that requires a clearance. 

The lab is looking to hire a couple thousand people over the next year or so (I forget the exact number and timeframe). It has a huge budget, and with all the boomers retiring, there’s *massive* hiring all over the lab. The number of applicants for a given position will vary greatly depending on the position, but anecdotally, as someone that’s got a few job ads open right now, I can tell you that the lab is a very popular place to apply, especially for new or recent grads.

">	Has there ever been talk about the lab shutting down? My fear is buying real estate in Los Alamos or White Rock and then a shutdown occurs causing property values to plummet.

Nah. Nuclear weapons and national security science aren’t going anywhere. LANL and SNL bring in some of the most income and jobs to NM. The only way the Lab shuts down is if something catastrophic happens.

>	Is the lab taking on a hybrid or virtual work posture? I realize this may be position-specific, but curious to see what employees are seeing.

For my part of the Lab at least (Scientist), a hybrid approach is totally possible with manager support, but this depends heavily on your position (e.g., if you primarily do experimental or classified work, then you obviously can’t do that from home). 

>	Does taking a position non-research related (utilities, facilities projects, etc.) have good job security? One of the positions we are interested in is non-research related, and I fear those positions may not be seen as important since they are a support function.

Yes, for the same reasons I mentioned before. In order for us to be able to conduct science, we need functioning facilities and support staff. The support staff are *incredibly* important. Without the support staff, everything would come to a grinding halt.",t2_jrgzy,Dr_Geoff_Fairchild,0,1640212799.0,0,t1_hpm4hhv,hpm4hhv,True,TacoMaster7,t3_rmc39f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/rmc39f/considering_move_to_los_alamos/,Considering Move to Los Alamos,/r/LosAlamos/comments/rmc39f/considering_move_to_los_alamos/hpm4hhv/,7,r/LosAlamos,0,7
"Many people at the lab have to work on-site 100% of the time due to the nature of their job. Far more could work from home 1-2 days a week.

"Lab budget is largly at the 2 year budget whim of congress.   There are ups and downs depending on political leanings of DC.  It's looking good and has strong bipartisan support for the foreseeable future however it's been thru unexpected ups and downs before.  

Most recently roughly 2007 thru 2016 it was in a flat budget starting with layoffs and attrition without replacement phase.  Housing was cheap and available though.  Since then budgets and outlook have been high.  

The lab is a diverse place and it is highly unlikely the lab will ""go away"" probably 70% of jobs are largly secure due to the nature of the work including facilities and waste needing long term oversight and security but a lot of R&D and programs are at the will of congress.  This is probably 30% of positions.   

A similar downturn happened a few years after underground testing ended.  The lab had a major RIF like double digit percentage reduction.   Dark times for a bit after that.

"Do you know what would actually help? 

Change the zoning laws to allow in-law apartments  anywhere with a lot that is big enough. 

Another thing the county has been doing is when they prove these new developments, like the large one in White Rock, they're requiring a set aside for below-market-rate housing. These are sold using very complex contracts to you guessed it government workers. They always start out with teachers firefighters and police officers, but then it ends up being any other county worker. 

The developer has to selling some units below-market-rate, so they have to sell the remainder above normal market rate. This drives up costs for everyone else.

The solution to too few homes, is to build more homes.

The idea that you can force the building of inexpensive homes defies economic reality. Let the developers do what they want to do which is to build super high-end homes. The people who can afford them will sell their slightly less expensive homes to buy the more expensive places, and the waterfall of selling will depress prices all the way down the chain of value.

Here's a thought experiment: what if some developer was able to come in and build a thousand million dollar homes in Los Alamos county? Do you think they would all sell into this market? I don't.

I doubt more than 1/4 of them would sell.

That means the rest of them will have to be discounted. If the discount price is $750000, the existing houses on the market at $750 k will have to discount their price.

"I'm okay with it. There's effectively only two low-income complexes in LA anyway. Income limits for low-income housing in LA are like $45k/yr. for a single person.

I'm glad that there are options for people at that income level so they can have a bit more breathing room in their budgets.

"Thanks for your great reply. Before I started teleworking 100% earlier this year my route to work was Hwy 4 to Pajarito.

"Reading the comments on this post, you can tell who lives on the Hill (LA) versus White Rock, lots of incorrect information in the replies.

 I've lived in WR for 17 years. I know the housing market in both locations is expensive and I can not comment on the current price difference between the two communities. When my husband and I were looking for a home, we lived in LA and were at first not interested in WR, however the price per square footage was certainly better in WR. Once we started looking there, I can say that the homes generally were ""newer"" -- built in the late 60s -- and the yards were bigger. This was an important point for us because we wanted dogs and kids (someday).

Amenities in WR include a grocery store, post office, library, two elementary schools, one of the best places to eat in Northern Mexico (Pig and Fig) and two swimming pool clubs. All of this is less than 5 minutes away in a car and my kids and I bike everywhere. I've never spent more than 10 minutes in line waiting at the Post Office. Although the grocery store is smaller, I have never seen lines backed up to the freezer section like the one in LA, and frankly the staff is A LOT nicer than the one in town. And since we have a Pueblo owned gas station, the gas is usually 5-10 cents cheaper in WR than say the Conoco station. Unfortunately, we did lose our Smith's gas station, but the Speedway keeps its prices competitive with the Tewa.

The commute to the lab is actually shorter that living in parts of LA. If you have a Lab badge, Pajarito road is available to you and it sees significantly less traffic than the Truck Route or Main Hill road. I work at TA-3 and the time from home, parking my car, and making coffee  in my office is 20 minutes. Especially right now when there is construction, I've NEVER seen bumper to bumper traffic on my commute. It's quite nice.

Now if you have kids, one down side to living in WR is getting kids to activities and the middle school years. The middle school is quite far, about 30-45 minutes using the Truck Route. Middle School is only grades 7-8, so two years of long bus rides.  For anything out of town, you hit Highway 4, one traffic light and you are off. My trips to Santa Fe from WR are about 35 minutes.

White Rock is suburban, doesn't have things like the Beer Co-op or the concerts on the Pond. But man is it awesome to walk home after the Overlook Park fireworks while a bunch of folks are stuck in traffic and buses. 

Good luck with your house search and check out both places. It's certainly not Santa Fe with the museums or shopping malls. The outdoor access is fantastic in both communities and the schools are excellent.",t2_mx4db,rumplebike,0,1633098124.0,0,t1_hez84sb,hez84sb,True,MontrealMover95,t3_pyrb76,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/pyrb76/are_houses_in_white_rock_cheaper/,Are Houses In White Rock Cheaper?,/r/LosAlamos/comments/pyrb76/are_houses_in_white_rock_cheaper/hez84sb/,9,r/LosAlamos,0,9

"I would say that anywhere in Los Alamos/white rock is going to be competitive for housing. Both towns have way less “action” than Santa Fe. White rock is a bit sleepier IMO but to be honest both are lacking in community events, restaurants and services to the community in general. We’re originally from much, much larger cities.

"Good answers so far, I'll add a little.

There are new homes going up next to Pajarito road in white rock, but they are big houses on small lots.

My job offer came within a week after my interview. If you Google LANL regular hire relocation you can find the document that outlines the benefit.

Read it thoroughly and ask specific questions about your situation to the relocation folks before assuming you'll be reimbursed, especially with family members etc. There is another government relocation document that actually details all the specifics (federal travel regulation or similar) I didn't see this until after my start date and got screwed on some things.

I would recommend joining local Facebook groups to get some housing info. A lot of people use them and I know people who bought a house that way that never got listed on the market.

"About 70+ days average for hiring.  Note this is average actual time may vary.

Housing is difficult at best.   Although I've heard several luck stories like people moving to town and buying the perfect house imeadiatly.   Santa Fe is better with more selection if you don't mind commuting.  Generally if you have kids many people prefer to be in Los Alamos schools though.  

 1/4 - 1/3 acre lot are the big ones most yards are small.  Pajarito Acres and La Senda are the only subdivisions with large yards, all basalt and minimal grass though. 

There are a few open lots left but they dont come up for sale often.  Best bet is to go to the county online property viewer and look for private owned vacant lots and see if the owner is interested in selling, I'm betting they already answer a lot of inquiries.   Quemazon has a few and there should be more opening up at some point in Pondsrosa estates.  

Los alamos by design is surrounded by government land.  Good for recreation and rual lifestyle bad for housing  availability.   

The lab pays only for the length of time on your paperwork.   And only the GSA rate for housing plus perdiem.  You will have to cover the difference for example a short term rental on a fully furnished house (in SF) while your stuff is in storage and you are house hunting may be more than the GSA rate.

"Once you're selected the main wait is getting HR to figure out how much exactly to pay you. Every org has their own HR specialist, and they vary greatly. Some are extremely slow, some quick, some low-ball on your offer (and your management will have to fight them, which can take time). The lab is super cautious about telling you anything concrete until you get an offer letter. So if they're being vague or qualifying their responses, it's not personal, they're just following the rules. 

Relocation: https://lanl.gov/careers/employees-retirees/travel/_assets/docs/relocation-travel-faqs.pdf

Housing: Good luck? Housing has always been tight 'on the hill'. As the lab has been hiring more, it's been insane. Rentals are rare, and housing prices have shot up substantially in the last few years. I recommend broadening your search as much as you find reasonable. Santa Fe is also expensive. Places in the valley (Espanola, Pojoaque) are cheaper and much more likely to be pet friendly.

"I can answer some of these. 

The hiring process at the lab is pretty slow. I knew my boss beforehand and he informally told me I was getting an offer a month before HR sent me the offer letter. I think you can start pretty quickly after getting the offer letter though (I don’t remember, I wanted to take time off). There is basically zero chance of a hiring freeze right now. 

Reimbursement is pretty quick - once you start they will set up a meeting with you to go over all your receipts and reimbursement is a week or two after that. LANL will not pay your salary for the days you are moving, that will be before your official start date. I’m pretty sure they don’t check whose name the cars are in (we shipped mine and drove my wife’s) but there is a limit on the number of cars they will pay to move.  I don’t recall if they paid my wife’s per diem during the move (we were not married at the time). 

For housing, there are a few pet friendly temporary accommodations but they are difficult to find. LANL won’t pay your rent while looking for a house to purchase, just the 2 months in a hotel or Airbnb. 

If you want to live in Los Alamos or White Rock, lol at the thought of a new construction home. There’s literally no space to build more houses due to the town being on a mesa which contributes to the housing shortage. There are some new homes in Santa Fe though if you don’t want to commute.",t2_13wv1q,magnetic-nebula,0,1631078937.0,0,t1_hc0yj79,hc0yj79,True,cman726,t3_pk3h21,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/pk3h21/lanl_hiring_timeline_and_relocation/,LANL Hiring Timeline and Relocation,/r/LosAlamos/comments/pk3h21/lanl_hiring_timeline_and_relocation/hc0yj79/,4,r/LosAlamos,0,4

"Some reasons for long term ads:

Haven't had the right candidate apply yet, this is typical for specialized fields. 

 Many hiring managers keep the job open until an offer is accepted to try and ensure they still have a pool of viable candidates.   If they close the ad on the first viable candidate and the candidate withdraws it's a pain to reissue the job ad.  Going thru the process on two candidates who withdraw at the last step may take 6 months or more to then offer a third for example. 

They may be hiring multiple people from one ad.  It's not uncommon to hire 10 people from a single ad for positions in high demand. 

They could just be busy and have forgot to close.  

Overall I'd say the early job postings get the most attention for hiring and also for competition.  But don't count out the long ones you may hit exactly the right time when a candidate withdrew and they still need someone quick.",t2_9atwkbma,estanminar,0,1628769418.0,0,t1_h8n7je1,h8n7je1,True,UnknownInternetUser2,t3_p2rs1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/p2rs1k/regarding_applying_to_jobs_at_lanl/,Regarding Applying to Jobs at LANL,/r/LosAlamos/comments/p2rs1k/regarding_applying_to_jobs_at_lanl/h8n7je1/,1,r/LosAlamos,0,1

"Using the correct LANL style cover letter will be a huge benefit to the hiring official.  Some thoughts:

1  It helps them understand how you meet the specific criteria for the position or even if you don't you can provide similar experience or help them understand the deltas.

2  It also shows you care enough about the position to fill out the application per the requested format and not just spraying resumes. 

3 some positions may not get a lot of applicants who fill out the LANL style cover letter.  This probably   says something about stereotypes of the average person in the particular field.

"Yep, more is better. Even if you don't meet every required or desired thing, have something relevant to say about each. 

A couple other bits: 
1. Hiring can take a while. It's generally up to the team/group leader, not HR, from screening through interviews and final selection.  That can include doing prescreening calls to a couple dozen candidates, and these people have a regular job to do too.

"Yes, you should copy and paste the requirements and write directly about how you meet or exceed them. Most (all?) Of the time, cover letters are scored against a rubric of the minimum and desired requirements. 

You want to make it as easy as possible for them to score you against the rubric. Non-explicit writing about how you meet criteria make it hard for them to figure out what box to check... Don't give them a reason to score you low. It's okay if your cover letter is several pages.

"Congratulations on your job acceptance at LANL! My fiance works for a subsidiary of LANL and we moved here from Bend Oregon and had a similar predicament. We rented in Santa Fe for a year and he HATED the commute, 45 min each way was just too much on the daily. We couldn't afford a place that we actually liked in Los Alamos and we ended up settling in La Mesilla, San Pedro area about 20 minutes from Los Alamos on a 300K 2 Bed/2 Ba on a half acre with a well. Something you would not get in Los A! Our experience in house shopping was something out of a horror story, our Broker was next level rude and unprofessional with us and I decided I was never going to let us be in that situation ever again out here, so I got my Real Estate license here in New Mexico immediately after we closed. Now, I am helping LANL buyers primarily, find homes - all over the Santa Fe/Pojoaque/Espanola and even El Dorado/Pecos areas! I work for Keller Williams in Santa Fe. I pride myself in my work ethic and integrity, I will help you get re-situated in a new place, because that's what I lacked when we moved out here - solid help from someone invested in our success! If you're ever in need of a Buyer's Broker - please do reach out, would be amazing to work with a fellow Redditor and help you find the dream home.

"Commute is fine. I live on the north side of Santa Fe and it takes me 35-40 minutes in the morning, absolutely no traffic.  In the evening if you leave between 4:45 and 5:15 it will take you \~10 minutes longer to get home, the road from the lab to Santa Fe has a stoplight on it that gets a little backed up.  That's the only ""rush hour"" there is.

I only take the park and ride bus when there's bad weather because my car is bad in the snow. it's always showed up on time and I've never had an issue getting a seat.  They seem to have aligned the number of buses with expected capacity pretty well.  It's basically the most pleasant ride I've ever taken on public transportation in my life. 

I will say that the Park and Ride is a bit annoying if your office isn't in TA-3 (the main section of the lab).  there is a lab taxi that will take you from the bus stop to your office, but it stops running at \~5pm so if you want to take a later bus home you're out of luck.

"Housing is expensive and difficult to find in both areas. Much more to do in Santa Fe, so living there would be an easier life transition. If you get sick of the commute you can try small-town life up here on the hill, but it's easier to have that in-between first. I got sick of the commute and bought a house up here. Sometimes I wish I'd bought in Santa Fe but most of the time I'm happy I live so close to work. 

You won't avoid driving in the snow. It will snow and you will need to go out sometimes. Most of the time it'll snow in both places. Sometimes we'll get 6 inches and Santa Fe doesn't see a flake. Other times it's the other way around. In that case the lab will likely be open and you'll be stuck driving snowy roads from Santa Fe, because closures are based only on conditions in Los Alamos.

Don't know all that much about the bus but I don't think it fills up. There's 3 per morning and evening I believe, but the specific schedule is online. It makes a few stops, so it would be longer than driving yourself, but you also don't have to actively drive. Costs $3 each way. 

Once you're at the lab, LANL Taxi can get you to your work place, and then you can sign out a government vehicle if you need to get places on lab property (the lab is ~40 sq mi, a car is necessary to get around) *if* your group/building has them.

~~It's those that can show residency in FL that can get them....so they're paying taxes as well, and given that they're wealthy, they're likely paying more than you.~~ So apparently it's up to the hospitals to determine if someone gets it or doesn't.

Short term with yard unfurnished suitable for family may be difficult in Los Alamos/ White Rock.   I suggest take the first minimally acceptable one you find so as not to loose it.  Some find one easy some take a long time.  I know several people who ran out of the lab temp housing allowance living in a hotel before they found something.   I also know people who rolled into town and called around and found a place first day by pure luck.  As someone said small town with difficult housing situation.

"I think it really depends on your timing.. Los Alamos is a small town with a housing shortage, so there isn't necessarily a consistent stream of great options. In my experience, most places do not allow dogs (even with fenced yards), which limited my own housing search. Houses with yards do come up somewhat often, and if you'd settle for a duplex or a quad plex you should be able to find something.

You could check out various housing pages like:

"Do you have a realtor? If not, I highly suggest Kristy Ortega with Remax. She's helped us out twice and we'll use her again next time we move. Regardless, you're going to need one and I'd start getting everything ready now (preapproval, etc) because places are snatched up quickly. If you see a place you like, I'd recommend either just bidding on it, or coming out here for a few days to see it and then deciding. Even if you end up not liking it, you could fix it up and wait for something else to come up once you're living here. We stayed in our first house for barely a year, remodeled the kitchen and fireplace/sitting room and sold it for a $30k profit. It's a seller's market so as I said before you'd have no issues getting rid of it if you wanted.

"East coast transplant here. I say this every time someone asks a question like yours - I like the town, but the only reason I'm staying in the area is for the pay at the lab. While the community does (or did, pre-Covid) have a lot of events I liked (art festivals, Halloween, Christmas, etc parades and events), the places to eat, shop, and meet people are extremely limited. There are maybe 3 or 4 what I'd call ""good"" restaurants in the area, the rest are either average to poor and would be out of business if there was any real competition in town. Hell, one of the things I look forward to the most when visiting friends and family back east is being able to eat real ethnic food again. My biggest gripe is the lack of good Thai, Indian, Vietnamese, or any Korean food here, in Santa Fe, or even Albuquerque. Just about any time someone recommends a place to eat I've been disappointed. For shopping, there are a few small businesses in town, but again, very few that are good, and most of those are speciality shops. As far as meeting people - it's a town full of nerds with specific interests, but you can find people at the breweries. If you're looking to date, I've heard the options are very limited in town and you'd be better off looking at Santa Fe.

As far as vaccinations and testings, they're definitely doing them, though I haven't heard of a push to get people outside essential services (hospital, emergency services, teachers) vaccinated yet. There is a driving school, as I've seen the ad for it in the high school parking lot.

As for tips - as much as I bitched about certain things in this town, the area itself is beautiful and I'd take it over an east coast city with all the food I'd want. There's the town's ski hill that's a 20 minute drive from my house to the slopes which is awesome when it snows, lots of trails, hiking, dirt biking all around. The drive through the Caldera is beautiful.

Thanks. This does help us with the evaluation. It’s sounding like there’s probably not going to be (as good of) an opportunity for a favorable market swap from Austin even during recession.

"A few things:

I like this town, but I would not recommend living here unless 1) you don't mind driving to Santa Fe every time you need something that one of the grocery stores or hardware stores don't have here and 2) you don't care about access to really great food. As another poster mentioned, most people that live here work at the lab for 2 good reasons - the pay is great, and 20 minutes max from your office to your house....though 0 minutes for lots of us that are now in a permanent work from home situation. If I didn't work at the lab, I definitely wouldn't be living here. Just not enough access to restaurants and stores. Plus, you pay a premium for living in the town and you'd get much more for your money in Santa Fe. I came from a nice area outside of a capital city on the east coast and paid $325k for a \~2500 sqft house built in 1994 on a half acre lot and was a 20 minute drive to just about everything. The first house we bought here was $361k for about 1850 sqft and built in 1951 with not many upgrades done. The second house we bought was $410k for about 2400 sqft and built 1953, though with a few additions.

There are very few lots available and the ones that are available are not good at all from what I've seen over the past year. All the really nice lots with canyon views already have houses on them...but even those are generally the smallest that LA has to offer. If you want a decent lot you'd have to look in Pajarito Acres....but again, they have houses on them. You can (I think) knock down the house that's on the lot and rebuild but unless you have stupid money I wouldn't recommend it.

Regarding your question about recession: I'm not sure why the other poster said the housing market took a big hit in 2008, but according to my girlfriend's parents who have lived here for the past 40-50 years, the entire area is in it's own little bubble and house prices were largely unaffected by the recession. The only thing that could hurt them is if more houses were available than the need for them which is not going to happen unless the lab begins laying off people - which is not going to happen in the near future as they're still planning on hiring thousands over the next couple years.",t2_4rzq3,sorry_but,0,1614808701.0,0,t1_gpl1ei2,gpl1ei2,True,Bobeerto,t3_lwc1fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/lwc1fk/homebuilder_recommendations_and_tax_question/,Homebuilder recommendations and tax question,/r/LosAlamos/comments/lwc1fk/homebuilder_recommendations_and_tax_question/gpl1ei2/,2,r/LosAlamos,0,2

"I don't mean to monopolize the thread but I find this topic interesting.  Los Alamos county tax info is publicly available via the parcel viewer link below.  If you click on a property you can navigate the popup to the Notice of Valuation (NOV) which will tell you the estimated tax value and the estimated tax.  Keep in mind the estimated tax value of the property is usually not an accurate estimate of what you might pay to live there but sometimes you can cross reference with zillow.  Historically housing prices are basically driven by the labs hiring practices.  If they are hiring prices are high if they are not prices are low.  This is driven by congressional budgets on a 2 year election cycle so one year there could be a RIF and housing crashes and next election/ budget cycle they could hire 2000 people and housing skyrockets.  Currently the lab is on a fairly stable up trend enjoying bipartisan support.  Long term locals know this and buy on the crashes and sell on the high.  This is risky though as past trend does not predict future market.  Id say housing prices overall in 87544 are only marginally impacted by the economy and only to the extent congress diverts money from the lab to pay for other economic woes.  This is all speculative personal opinion on my part.

"I've only been here since 2018 but my understanding is that the housing market took a big hit. LANL employs 1/3 of the people in town, so when they have any kind of layoffs and hiring freezes, it stops any drive in the market. However, the lab has been hiring *tons* of people to make up for the losses during hiring freezes after the early 90s and early 2010s, as well as baby boomers retiring, so the market has been skyrocketing. 

I'm expecting, if not a crash, at least a stagnation in the next few years, but even during hiring freezes the lab hires lots of students, who rent for 6 months to 2 years at a time. I'm hoping my smaller sized house will appeal to students if I don't decide to stay long-term.",t2_mmee2us,Pficky,0,1614741506.0,0,t1_gphsvh4,gphsvh4,False,Bobeerto,t3_lwc1fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/lwc1fk/homebuilder_recommendations_and_tax_question/,Homebuilder recommendations and tax question,/r/LosAlamos/comments/lwc1fk/homebuilder_recommendations_and_tax_question/gphsvh4/,2,r/LosAlamos,0,2

"87544 is los alamos propper. Los alamos county is 100% surrounded by public land many perimeter lots directly abut national Forrest service or other public area trails.  Very active outdoor community if you like mountains and high desert.   Inernet is acceptable for remote work.  I personally like 87544 but it's mainly due to the excellent schools and mountain access.  

Other zip codes in order of personal preference with areas close to LA and Santa Fe include 87505, 87501, 87506, 87522, 87531  These areas have fantastic properties interspersed with less than acceptable areas.   I would highly recommend not buying a great looking property until living in the area for a year and getting to know where is good/ bad based on your preferences and tollerances and  talking with locals.

"Property taxes are dirt cheap IMO, but more expensive than much of the state. Effective rate is 0.83% (2.5% on 1/3 of the sale price). For reference I bought a small 1200 sqft house near downtown for a little under $350k. I paid more than most people would, but liked the home and location so idgaf.  Properties are reassessed in April, and I expect my taxes to double, since I paid a good chunk more than the house last sold for.  Cost of living: NM has income taxes, and the county and state have pretty high sales taxes at 7.13% together. Utilities are only available from the county and are a bit more expensive than basically everywhere else in the state. All goods have to be brought up 1 of 2 mountain roads to service a community of 20,000 people, and it's the 8th best-paid county in the country, so nobody is offering a bargain.

Buying in the winter there's less inventory but far less competition, since many people move here after finishing a university program. Things right now are selling at asking price, last summer things were selling for 15%-20% above asking price. That said, you'll probably still pay a good chunk more to build than buying an existing home. There's very few lots left in Los Alamos. Maybe look into White Rock for that, if you don't mind living in what basically amounts to a bedroom community. There are a couple good restaurants, a grocery store, and library available in White Rock, as well as cable internet too.

I lived in the valley  below town that the previous commenter was talking about for two years before buying in town, and would not recommend it if you need high-speed internet. My only choice was satellite and I was regularly getting speeds below 1mbps. You can pay more to expand your unlimited data cap but even at like $200 a month you'll hit the cap and be heavily deprioritized. Plus, you have to drive on a highway to get anything, groceries, hardware store, food, etc. No delivery options either. It was a nice experience but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone long-term, especially if they enjoy those kind of conveniences. Living in the Jemez is similar, as I have a friend who owns a house up there.",t2_mmee2us,Pficky,0,1614731572.0,0,t1_gph9i8v,gph9i8v,False,Bobeerto,t3_lwc1fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/lwc1fk/homebuilder_recommendations_and_tax_question/,Homebuilder recommendations and tax question,/r/LosAlamos/comments/lwc1fk/homebuilder_recommendations_and_tax_question/gph9i8v/,3,r/LosAlamos,0,3
Thanks! Can you recommend any zip codes or names of surrounding communities? Home price and school district are irrelevant to us. We are strictly looking for 1) low property tax..ie less than half of the $10k/year we pay now 2) proximity to public land and 3) high speed internet.

"Bennett custom builders for homebuilder is the only one I'd go with. 

Cost of living in Los Alamos propper ""on the hill"" is realitivly high as rual areas go and you generally need to drive 40 miles for a lot of things.  Don't generally expect to save any money moving from the majority of other rual/ suburb areas.  You will save money if you live in a high tax metroplex area.  

Cost of housing is driven by the basically single employer.   House cost basically aligns with the maximum loan you can get based on the employers salary bell curve.    Eg many houses cost around the average salary, high end homes sell for a realitive bargain and low end home's sell for a premium due to this effect.  

Build able lots are available but in far less numbers than the average rual community and often located in odd places for high price.   Due to the specific oddball history of Los alamos there are tons of ""crap""  houses and trailers on what would normally  be considered ultra premium cliff and view, etc.   Teardowns arn't really a thing yet again because of the salary reason mentioned above but this is an option.   

There are awesome surrounding communities which can be better and more affordable also but I would recommend you rent for a year before choosing to buy in the surrounding area to get the lay of the land and understand where you are buying from the local level.

I wouldn’t live in Taos for that reason, regardless of commute length. 

I live in Santa Fe and before COVID-19, took the commuter bus when it was snowing. Fairly convenient, you don’t have to transfer or anything if you work in TA-3.

"I will say while your scouting where to live, keep in mind the amenities you would like.  Los Alamos is small and doesn't have as many shops or restaurants as Santa Fe (I'm not as familiar with Taos so I can't speak to it). 

When my spouse and I were looking at where to live when we moved here we picked Santa Fe due to the shopping/restaurants, as well as distance to airport(s). It's also much closer to Albuquerque which has some amenities that Santa Fe doesn't. 

We looked at quality of life vs. distance to work mostly because where we lived before moving here we had picked living closer to our work but quality of life was not the best. 

If you only have to commute once or twice a week to the lab, and that will always be a thing, then I think you need to look more at what you plan to do outside of work and which city will provide you with quality of life.",t2_mijlt,melho,0,1611688008.0,0,t1_gkut4i4,gkut4i4,False,[deleted],t3_l5gbij,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/l5gbij/moving_for_lanl_job_santa_fe_taos/,Moving for LANL job - Santa Fe?

"There is a huge difference between these two bus trips. Coming from Taos, you ride in relatively small RTD buses, sort of like riding a school bus. They rattle and bounce you around. Coming from SF, you ride in big Park & Ride buses, like riding in a luxury cross country touring bus. They give you a smooth and quiet ride. You can read on them. I've seen commuters working on their laptops on P&R buses. The RTD passengers ride for free. P&R passengers pay a reasonable fee.

I recommend that you postpone your decision about where to live, if you can. If you have stuff to move, pay to put it in storage for a few months. Start by living in a short-term rental somewhere near LANL. Spend your first few months living in NM scouting out where you want to live long-term. Ride the bus to Taos and ride the bus to SF, even if you don't feel serious about commuting by bus.

"So as others mentioned, the drive is a bit long, but honestly once or twice a week wouldn't be bad, especially if you've driven in real traffic before. Rush hour here consists of sitting in ""traffic"" for about 10 minutes, if that. Just keep in mind if the lab has plans on bringing you in full time once covid starts settling down the drive could be a bit much. That said, as far as the ""town"" experience - I come from a city back east where Santa Fe would be more like an area of the suburbs. You've got access to a variety of stores, restaurants (though not much of a good variety), etc. In Los Alamos there are few good restaurants, 4 grocery stores (though 2 are specialty), and 2 hardware stores. I can't tell you how many times I've had to either order something online or go to Santa Fe or Espanola to get something that could normally be picked up from a store within 10 miles. A little annoying, but part of small town life. I've only visited Taos a couple times, and while it does provide better options than Los Alamos, the amount and variety is not as large as Santa Fe.

I can't comment on the social aspect of Los Alamos as I came here with my SO and am not a big drinker, but there are (well, pre-Covid) a number of clubs and events in town where you can definitely find people to hang out with.  As far a beauty goes - I personally find Los Alamos and Taos the ""prettier"" of the areas. Santa Fe along Cerrillos road just reminds me of a suburban area that's turning ghetto.

"Firstly, big congrats to OP's fiancé securing a job at LANL! To add information to what others already mentioned:

(i) The commuter rail suspended operation indefinitely due to the COVID. If you end up living outside Los Alamos, you'd definitely need car(s).

(ii) Applying to online job postings is not a complete waste of time, but the chance is razor thin. I myself got my current job of staff Scientist from outside the LANL, it was a super cold application and I still managed to secure the position. But I would agree I was extremely lucky. Actually I was rejected once (i.e., not selected to proceed to on-site interview stage), but then got a second chance because someone withdrew his/her interview and... here I am. 
All in all, I second the others' opinion that building personal network within the Lab will definitely help you landing on a position. And if you got your PhD within the past five years, securing a postdoc position and later getting converted to a staff may be a good strategy. Postdocs here are much better paid than academic counterparts, so it could be a little career setback (since you have a regular, better-paid job) but not a financially too severe one.


Secondly, the comments are helping me as well, I didn't even know there exists a dual career office. I joined LANL in March, it's been 8 months and nobody told me about it, even though I have been telling managers that I have a dual career issue. I am very curious about how things would go with OP. I think my wife and I would have more obstacles because we are permanent residents but not US citizens. I will contact the dual career office. In the meantime, please DM me if you would be interested in exchanging more info; my wife is kinda in a similar situation with OP. We both are PhDs, she has a well-paid job in a different state, she wants to relocate but cannot find a suitable position here in Los Alamos, not even in nearby area, etc.",t2_5wdyls9v,BurnRate85,0,1605441614.0,0,t1_gcdqiwo,gcdqiwo,True,jobweldun,t3_ju4jzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAlamos/comments/ju4jzg/relocation_advice_for_couple/,Relocation Advice for Couple?,/r/LosAlamos/comments/ju4jzg/relocation_advice_for_couple/gcdqiwo/,5,r/LosAlamos,0,5

"A) Your fiancé should have discussed this with his future manager when he got the offer. If he hasn’t, he needs to now. 

B) If you’re just tossing your job applications in the computer system without talking to anyone, you’re probably wasting your time. Email people you’d like to work with. Ask them if they know of any positions you’d be good for. The jobs website is only a portion of the jobs that get hired.

C) You and your fiancé should reach out to the dual careers office. 

D) If you live on the south side of Santa Fe, ABQ is about the same commute as Los Alamos (obviously depending where in ABQ), you should consider that.
