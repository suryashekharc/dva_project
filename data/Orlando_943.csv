It’s fine to criticize the lack of professionalism before the ride started but those who are critiquing how others in the clip  are behaving or conducting themselves AFTER the fact (when his body hit the ground) need to stop and have a little more compassion for them and everyone involved. Those  who had to witness that in real life…. It is absolutely shocking to witness a normal death but to witness one in such a tragic freak accident final destination type way is beyond comprehension. Don’t judge unless you have been in their shoes which you should be very thankful you’re not. What you’re seeing is shock not lack of empathy or lack of urgency so please go easy on them as they are probably all going through terrifying ptsd right now.

If it appears to be a suspicious death, homicide, suicide, accident, etc. - they transport to the Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy, which is completed by a Doctor.

"The ride employees are supposed to recognize that it doesn’t click far enough and remove a person from the ride if their height/weight/shoulder width/build/body type prevents the safety mechanisms from doing their job.  

Every time a person rides on a Disney or Universal ride, the workers check *every single rider* to ensure that the portion that keeps you from- ya know, flying the fuck outta the ride- is secured properly.  Even if you so clearly fit the seat that there’s no need to check- they still check.  Even if the ride doesn’t really do much, much less do a free fall type drop- they still check.  They physically take their hands and pull the mechanism themselves or ask you to while they observe.  If you haven’t made it tight enough, they make it tighter. 

As an example, if you ride Flights of Passage in Animal Kingdom and the seat does not click to a certain point, you can’t ride- *and that ride doesn’t even go anywhere*.  And I swear that ride mold was not made for an average American body because a person that is thin but very tall or has long legs cannot ride that ride.  It’s not always about weight.

My ex was of average weight but built like a line backer and his shoulder width and depth prevented him from being able to ride some coasters that have the safety portion over the shoulder.  Even when he could fit in them, it made him incredibly nervous because the harness never went far down enough for him to relax so finally he stopped riding them entirely.

"Comment by u/funbrians

I understand this isn’t fun, but it’s both Orlando and attraction related so a discussion should be had. I’ve ridden it a few times, I actually have a photo of me in that exact seat or one to the left of it. My armchair analysis is this. Negligence on the manufacturer for miscalculating maximum rotation for the over the shoulder restraint. The limit they calculated to get a light and dispatch was too high. If you look at every other “large” person seat for over the shoulder restraints there are not one, but 2 safety belts. This accident wasn’t an accident. This has been a known issue with over the shoulder restraints and large people for many years. Tyre was 6-6 280lbs.

There’s a ton of misinformation going around in comments about this. Please feel free to ask me any questions and I’ll do my best to answer. I have no OFFICIAL knowledge of this incident. I’m merely speculating based upon my experience with attractions, restraints, and this exact ride.

Here is a photo of the attraction. Tyre would have been in the same seat as myself , or 1-2 to my right. The “video” circulating was filmed just behind that railing in the mid right corner.

The over the shoulder restraints are a bit dark here, but the lower portion of them goes over your thighs like this. That is another installation of the Sky Fall model by FunTimes.

Here is an extreme example of the gap that occurs as a similar over the shoulder harness is rotating up to accommodate someone tall, or with a large chest or stomach. Notice the additional dual safety belts. Also notice without those belts, there’s nothing to stop you from being able to possibly slide out. The raised section in the crotch of the seat, and the bottom of the restraint no longer overlap. If you don’t have belts, there’s a maximum you can rotate that restraint up before there’s enough room to physically come out. Also remember, a body that Has a higher fat percentage is going to “squish” for lack of a better term. In other words the restraint will sit against the riders body, but the riders body isn’t rigid. More akin to fitting a water balloon through an opening smaller than the ballon as a whole- you could squeeze it through.

They aren’t pawl and ratchet over the shoulder harnesses. They have no “clicks”. They are rather tight, and lock into whatever position placed in. Again, the ride trips a light to show it’s rotated “enough” based on calculations. I believe those may have been innacurate. Combined with the lack of any backup such as belts, this can be dangerous. I don’t want to go with anymore suspicions, but I wonder if they simply used the same threshold as their other 3 standing attractions of the same model, But didn’t adjust it based on its taller height, and forces on riders.

"From u/Funbrians on original post:

I understand this isn’t fun, but it’s both Orlando and attraction related so a discussion should be had. I’ve ridden it a few times, I actually have a photo of me in that exact seat or one to the left of it. My armchair analysis is this. Negligence on the manufacturer for miscalculating maximum rotation for the over the shoulder restraint. The limit they calculated to get a light and dispatch was too high. If you look at every other “large” person seat for over the shoulder restraints there are not one, but 2 safety belts. This accident wasn’t an accident. This has been a known issue with over the shoulder restraints and large people for many years. Tyre was 6-6 280lbs.

There’s a ton of misinformation going around in comments about this. Please feel free to ask me any questions and I’ll do my best to answer. I have no OFFICIAL knowledge of this incident. I’m merely speculating based upon my experience with attractions, restraints, and this exact ride.

Here is a photo of the attraction. Tyre would have been in the same seat as myself , or 1-2 to my right. The “video” circulating was filmed just behind that railing in the mid right corner.

The over the shoulder restraints are a bit dark here, but the lower portion of them goes over your thighs like this. That is another installation of the Sky Fall model by FunTimes.

Here is an extreme example of the gap that occurs as a similar over the shoulder harness is rotating up to accommodate someone tall, or with a large chest or stomach. Notice the additional dual safety belts. Also notice without those belts, there’s nothing to stop you from being able to possibly slide out. The raised section in the crotch of the seat, and the bottom of the restraint no longer overlap. If you don’t have belts, there’s a maximum you can rotate that restraint up before there’s enough room to physically come out. Also remember, a body that Has a higher fat percentage is going to “squish” for lack of a better term. In other words the restraint will sit against the riders body, but the riders body isn’t rigid. More akin to fitting a water balloon through an opening smaller than the ballon as a whole- you could squeeze it through.

They aren’t pawl and ratchet over the shoulder harnesses. They have no “clicks”. They are rather tight, and lock into whatever position placed in. Again, the ride trips a light to show it’s rotated “enough” based on calculations. I believe those may have been innacurate. Combined with the lack of any backup such as belts, this can be dangerous. I don’t want to go with anymore suspicions, but I wonder if they simply used the same threshold as their other 3 standing attractions of the same model, But didn’t adjust it based on its taller height, and forces on riders.

"This is not true at all.  I used to work overnight as a news camera man here in Orlando.  I saw multiple dead people a night and doctors did not come to the scene to pronounce them dead.  Paramedics / EMTs would call a No Code / No Vitals for the dead that had no chance to come back.  

Now what would happen often with Juveniles that where No Codes, the Medics would do what has been called a Show Code (Working a code means performing life saving efforts to a patient that has no vitals, so a no code basically means working a code would have no effect).  A show code is when the medics put all the effort in, knowing full well it will not work, just do the parents can see that they tried, because their emotions will not allow them to understand there is no chance.

"""Falling"" from the ride does not adequately describe what happened to the poor kid. 

Basically, the ring of riders went all the way up as expected, then dropped down at free fall speed. When the ride itself hit the brakes about 50 feet off the ground, the poor kid instantly came out of his seat and kept going at speed. He very audibly hit the bricks, just barely off camera. Very unpleasant.

The camera then pans to include him lying on the pavers against the fence, with what looks very suspiciously like a growing bloodstain beneath him. The workers scramble to start letting others off the ride and clear the scene, while a couple people radio for medical assistance.

Some people are commenting that the workers  failed to render aid, but I suspect that between the horrible sound and what you could see even in the video, that it probably would have been pretty obvious the kid was beyond aid.

Induced demand is the concept that the population has more demand for transportation than transportation networks could ever possibly supply.

Which means that any new transportation addition that actually reduces transportation friction will quickly find a new equilibrium of higher usage.

"A few years ago I started attending the “Orlando Informer” private events at Universal. They are a travel blog that does private events at the parks and they sell a limited number of tickets. 

For the price of a 1 day park to park ticket (both parks) you get to go to their private event. It’s usually: 


8PM-1:30 AM (tickets get you in the parks at 5PM but normal guests have to leave at 8) 


Since it’s after park closing, the only people in the park are the people who have event tickets so almost every ride is no line at all - my husband rode Hulk 10x in a row! 


All you can eat food included (there are usually buffets or set menus at each restaurant) 


There are usually some other sort of perks like DJs playing music in the streets, all the games are free (no prizes just for fun), arcade games are free, characters are out (my son played air hockey with SpiderMan) etc. And the HP areas are usually way way less crowded than during a normal day so you can explore and play and cast spells all night.

"I went to the friends and family preview of Islands of Adventure at Universal Studios Orlando shortly before it was opened to the general public.

The box was on a rollercoaster rail that dropped down a simulated water fall. 

I had to physically hold myself in the box as it fell. I was in free fall, floating up off the plastic chair before the box hit the pool of water below. Never was I so terrified on a ride. Not because of how ‘extreme’ it was, really it wasn’t.  I almost flew out of the damn thing. 

It wasn’t long after the park opened that someone fell out and died. Of course the ride was closed and redesigned.

"Has the quality of education dropped over the years and employers stopped training? It’s been a good decade since I went to one of the crappiest schools in Central Florida and assumed every school was teaching the basics. Plus every employer I have worked for, would regularly give training (not just medical, but general emergency responses) to employees and new hires. It’s hard for me to believe that even (most likely adult) “teenagers” wouldn’t have at least some basic skills to be somewhat “prepared” for these situations or at least some common sense to not create distractions (trying to place liability and blame) while standing around a exit with trapped screaming passengers… 

Personally I have seen when job accidents happened and everyone worked fluidly with the basic skills learned and very minimum medical experience to be useful in some bad situations (also staffed by mostly young adults). So I don’t think I am or ever been in the minority here… Being a teen or young adult doesn’t mean you can’t help. This situation should have never happened, but the unfortunate response looks very bad for the employer and crew first responding.

"From what I can tell there's a video out there of three people talking to someone taking a video of them. If you look to your left ( their right ) there's some empty seats. You can see one person over to the left. It's either him that fell or someone close to him. It does look like his harness is too high and not clicked in all the way. It's hard to tell exactly if that's the case or not. It might not even be him. It could be a person next to him. The news says that the 14-year-old was from Missouri and he was with the family of one of his friends on vacation. That ride is the newest ride over at icon Park. I think it opened about 4 or 5 months ago I don't see that ride opening again for months if ever. I'm totally stunned in part because I'm a ride's mechanic. I've worked on every roller coaster at SeaWorld and now I work at Disney. I know a lot about roller coaster harnesses and it's near impossible for them to fail. It would literally take a strike from a missile. However, if one person wanted to make extra space for themselves, they could intentionally allow for a gap between the harness and their body. It's not smart but I've seen people do it. It's also the job of the person loading the ride to make sure that's not happening. Maybe this ride didn't have an additional clip from between the legs to the harness. This was probably a case of double human error. The person who fell did something incorrect and the ride operator either didn't correct it or also did something incorrectly. Also, there's a design flaw if this can happen at all. These drop rides are not like roller coasters. The Force at the bottom of the drop is very high. Way more than most rides . It's tragic.

"**[Gay village](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_village)** 
 
 >A gay village (also known as a gay neighborhood, gay enclave, gayvenue, gay ghetto, gaytto, gay district, gaytown, or gayborhood) is a geographical area with generally recognized boundaries that is inhabited or frequented by many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBT) people. Gay villages often contain a number of gay-oriented establishments, such as gay bars and pubs, nightclubs, bathhouses, restaurants, boutiques, and bookstores.

"Orlando doesn't have much of a gayberhood like a lotta other big cities. The gay bars are also a little more spread out... Southern near the airport, a couple downtown (including PHouse reopening!), Savoy in Ivanhoe, bathhouse down near Edgewood (which is a perfect coincidence), etc. Maybe 10-20 minute drives between them all. I know some guys prefer places that have a little more density so sorry for the bad news if that's what you're looking for. If not, though, you honestly can't go wrong really anywhere north of Colonial, east of OBT, and west of the 417. That mostly keeps you away from the tourists, students, and sketchy areas. 

It's a great city to be lgbtq in imo. Might be a little crass but checking sniffies will give you a good idea what I mean. The whole city lights up. Even if *that's* not what you're looking for, its at least indicative of how many of us are spread all around town.

You can see he's pretty big sitting in the chair because the shoulder part is resting a lot higher than the others (idk if it wasn't latched down or just because he's big).

The ride goes up like normal and drops. When the drop stops, the boy continues falling and slams into the ground face down.. apparently he was going 75mph when he hit. He didn't move or anything. There was deafening silence for a few seconds and then the people on the ride started screaming to call 911 and get them off the ride.

Belts not being a ""safety feature"" and belts that for some reason are not designed to withstand a 70mph impact - which would make them deficient when compared to, say, your average auto safety belt - are very different things.

"Yes and yes.

No one checked.  And he didn't pull it down further.  However I would like to point out that (and I don't know either way) these harnesses may be hydraulically locked instead of mechanically locked.  

Mechanically locked would be a ratcheting mechanism.  You hear clicks as a harness comes down.  The harness moving over the ratchet preventing the harness from going backward until released.

Hydraulically locked would be done through valves.

The reason this might matter is, if it's hydraulically locked, and the ride system says no more movement is allowed then no more movement is allowed...in any direction.  Because the valves would be locked.

So if that was the case and he pulled the harness half down, then the ride system said no more movement because the operators are getting ready to launch, then even if he wanted to pull it down further he wouldn't be able to.

But then that rolls back to the operators not doing *their* jobs.

"Airline seatbelts can withstand 16g

https://aerosavvy.com/airline-seatbelts/


The seat is independent of the seat occupant. The two things decelerate at different rates. 

The seat is bolted to the plane. The bolts hold the seat to plane. Those bolts help overcome inertial forces the seat experiences during a crash. The seat is effectively part of the plane. (It could shear off in a crash but if the tube is intact the seats will still be bolted to the floor).  The person sitting in that seat is free to move and is not part of the seat. The seatbelt helps in that regard but the person’s body will move independent of the seat. That’s where the seatbelt comes in. When the plane decelerates the person in the seat decelerates more slowly (that is the person is maintaining their velocity while the seat is losing its velocity) than the seat putting a load on the belt. The seatbelt must withstand that load. It’s simple physics really.

"I agree with the top down approach, but it does eventually make it down to them. The places I’d look first would be the seat angle/design, the locking mechanism, any additional seat belts, etc… Looking to see if there was any design flaw or defect. I’d then look at the maintenance of the ride, and see if anything was possibly missed that would’ve caused a malfunction. I’d then look at the operators (after all of that), to ensure they were taking the proper steps that they were supposed to.

What I’m saying is that the optics of “Did you check him” after a kid falls out looks very incriminating. They should already know who checked him. The person who checked him should also be confidently saying he was checked… 

Now I’m acknowledging I don’t know if she did, but she should be confirming that someone is calling EMS. Maybe she already did when she was off camera, but if she didn’t clearly ask, someone could simply be calling someone else. Example: The same way she was appearing to cover herself by asking them, the person on the phone could be calling their own lawyers or management. EMS would rather duplicate calls (they’d then tell you they have it) then a slightly delayed call that could’ve helped (likely could not have).",t2_yu4pc,Epcplayer,0,1648219848.0,0,t1_i22kwxo,i22kwxo,False,Femilip,t3_tnkxtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/tnkxtp/boy_14_dies_after_fall_from_ride_at_icon_park_in/,"Boy, 14, dies after fall from ride at ICON Park in Orlando, Florida.",/r/orlando/comments/tnkxtp/boy_14_dies_after_fall_from_ride_at_icon_park_in/i22kwxo/,-3,r/orlando,0,-3

Engineering gives the ride operators the manner in which they are supposed to operate the ride to do so safely.

"Also, when something extremely surprising and unexpected happens, but also happens very quickly, our brains can be surprisingly bad about actually processing it correctly.  I saw a guy walking under the Batman ride at Six Flags get hit by the coaster, but somehow in my mind it ended up looking like he fell off the coaster and hit the ground.  That's actually what I reported when I called 911.  It's very odd--I'd seen what happened, and yet somehow didn't remember it correctly right after it'd happened.  There was even another person standing right beside the one who got hit, and I somehow never saw him at all.  Just read about it in the paper later.

So in addition to the potential for shock, it's also quite possible that some people were sitting there trying to figure out what they'd just seen, even though it seems strange from the outside to say you could see something so simple and straightforward like a person falling and then not be sure what you saw.  But brains are weird.
