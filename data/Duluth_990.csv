I like the idea of accountability and visibility. I submitted snow clearing requests through the existing online form and they went into a black hole, never being serviced.

These apps only work if real action is taken. It will be easy for it to devolve into a map with thousands of requests that never get fixed. Then the whole thing is meaningless and dies.

"I didn't know about this until seeing your post. So I guess that's the main issue is awareness of the app/website.  


However they have 54 ""resolved"" issues and 108 open.  


I guess if people have a community issue great enough they can convince neighbors to report it to the app, then they can assign priority based on quantity.   


Which is a problem because that can open a can of worms. Because then only people with the awareness and access to this app will be the ones receiving the utility service we all need/deserve.

"What the fuck are you talking about? The three examples I gave were: standing in the way (not terrorism, but civil disobedience), locking oneself to equipment (also not terrorism) and ""throwing a whistle into a pipe"" (which alludes to the fact that police attempted to characterize a plastic whistle in a package as a possibly dangerous device), which is also not terrorism. So.... please explain how these examples are ""clearly terrorism."" They are not sabotage (which is vandalism and worse) nor are they damage of any kind.

Deliberately calling non-violent action ""sabotage"" is a blatant lie and you know it. Sabotage by definition involves physical damage to property, not just standing my ass in the way of your actions. Also, when Enbridge hires police to do their bidding, which they did,  that means the boundaries are obviously all kinds of mixed up.

Just facts, indeed. How many millions of dollars of physical sabotage were done compared to Enbridge's damage to our environment again?

P.S.: I know what very clearly what ecotage is, and how it's done. I'm actually not against damaging equipment that is damaging my environment. But that is not what happened, by and large, over the last few years of resisting pipelines.

P.S.S.: when you and your Enbridge cronies call civil disobedience terrorism, all you do is drive more people to our side.

"I think in Duluth it also really depends on what type of house you're looking to buy in addition to the macro level market. Duluth's got a lot of older, smaller houses on small lots. I personally know 6 friends (7 including myself) who bought houses in Duluth in the last year with relatively little trouble (relative to our current crazy housing market that is)-- didn't have to go ridiculously over the asking price or waiving inspection, etc. These were all 2 or 3 bedroom houses in relatively older, denser areas (East Hillside, Piedmont, Lincoln Park, Gary New Duluth etc), some of which required a little bit of work to make look nicer. If you're open to this sort of house, it's what Duluth has the most of and it anecdotally it seems like people are navigating that market ok. Still not a ton listed right now and might pay a little more than normally, but doable.

If you're looking for a larger home, multiple bathrooms, larger yard, newer house, ""nicer"" part of town, Duluth just doesn't have as many of those homes to start with and it's always going to be more competitive and it's only being exacerbated by the current market.

2 : political terrorism intended to damage an enemy's natural environment

"I have a love-hate with this city. Born and raised, though moved to Phoenix and absolutely loved it there (""coldest to warmest"") it changed my perception and standards for a city. Unfortunately, after 1.5 years I moved back due to a family member I lived with fell into drug abuse. I often wonder how much better off I'd be if I hadn't decided to move back. I was happier there for many reasons. People were nicer to me there, it felt more chipper and buzzing with happenings, the warmth and sunlight dissolved my 'SAD' (Seasonal Affective Disorder), many things more to do on any given day, and the economy was booming compared to the historic stagnation of Duluth - it was a natural fit. I do regret moving back, yes. I want to move to a more opportunity-rich warmer, sunnier city, yes. But I will always have a sentimentality to the Duluth area, even though there is a lot about it to be cynical about when one takes off the rose-colored glasses.

As for the people, I find the polar experience is the right word for it: some are cavity-inducing sweet and nice, while others are as cold and mean as the winters. For me, I tend to remember the more negative personalities - probably because many of the nice people have that Scandinavian '*keep to themselves*' mentality and A-holes tend to push their bad energy more easily.

"The connection to the city is an important aspect, like do we want this guy in our employ?  Should we hold city employees to a higher standard than a private firm might?


I think it would depend on his role.   If he is customer facing like a first responder or an inspector, then no.    If his job is to knock down physical barriers like a burning wall with whatever he has in hand, then it's probably ok.  This level of reasoning is likely not allowed as it requires a judgement that might not be applied fairly.

I would bet the city is rightly reserving judgement until there is an official judgement made by the court.  If he's convicted, I do not know that he can or would be fired.  I would hope he's being closely supervised for any sort of breach that would give an excuse.   

The better part of valor for him would be to get out of town.  I would hope that he's considering it, and I'd bet the existence of a leash law is in his consideration of where he might go.  There is a certain freedom and lower level of anxiety in place with no leash laws.   He could rightly blame his troubles on the leash law.      I only choose to live under leash laws to accommodate those close to me.  As a pariah, that equation may change for him.  

When I said homosexual, I meant the two people involved in the incident, like a man attacking a man, or a woman attacking a woman.  Without the imbalance, it'd be less reportable.     Homogendered would be a better word, but I don't know that ""homogendered"" has entered the lexicon yet.

Safety IMHO comes at too great a cost. To guard against the rare occurrence, we live in fear and anxiety with rules that may or may not keep us safe.  It might be better to just know how to handle oneself without having rules that might not be beneficial in all situations.  The rules themselves carry a psychological toll.

"I've sought help, it doesn't.   Some things you can't unlearn, like the futility of life.

What you're saying, is that I'm mentally ill, because I'm not cheering on your one sided view.  Mental illness is subjective.  There's no objective test for it.    

There is a value in mental illness though, a society needs the outliers to question reality, and challenge what is normal.   You can't expand the circle of human knowledge until you know where the edges are.

Even reality itself, is entirely subjective.  This is increasingly proven as the world shapes itself into two entirely different realities, FM radio vs. AM radio,  NPR vs. Rush Limbaugh.   

For you, I'd say don't dismiss someone just because you think they may be ill   On occasion you'll find truth in the rants of a lunatic.    You also don't want to dismiss someone because you don't agree with what they are saying, lest you find yourself stuck on one radio band and ,miss the larger truth.

We should repeal that damn leash law.    We can't control every stupid little thing, and in trying to, we make everything worse for everyone.

I think this is what the red hats, anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers are going on about, and as much as I find them to be a basket of deplorables, I understand their frustration.   

Taking on a bit more personal responsibility and accepting a bit more risk we can reduce the extra ordinary number of rules we have to live under and worry about, and in general lower the anxiety level of anyone.

Having mace on her doesn't really change things. 

And if she felt threatened, then reaching for her mace is not something that should change your view of the situation. She could have been reaching because of the dogs, or because of his behavior.

"Hitting someone is wrong every time, but that woman was being a Karen and in one way or another threatening him.  She wasn't trying to take a picture of the dogs because she thought they were cute, she was trying to threaten him with the legal system.  She wasn't so threatened by his breach of the sacred leash law that she couldn't pull out her phone.     Since threatening legal action not an immediate physical threat, yeah, he was wrong to resort to violence.  

Unless she actually did have mace on her, which would put a reasonable doubt in my mind.  

It's victim blaming, but I do think Karen did escalate the situation and is not entirely blameless.

"We still went $35k over asking. Looking back over our 8 month search, just about every house I would consider ""good"" went from $15-40k over. I would consider $30k over asking the safe amount to get your house, but more if there are a lot of bidders actually.  
We went with a pass/fail inspection. So while technically non-contingent on inspection what I was told is that if the inspector found major issues we could walk away. We may be out our earnest money at that point, but because it was pass/fail it would have likely been something that shouldve been disclosed and so we were likely to get back earnest money after a back and forth.  
Certainly not ideal, but from what we've been hearing the majority of accepted offers are going with no inspections.

"While there could be a number of reasons your plants arent taking to growing, I would guess the sandy soil could be one of the main contributors. 

Water will drain through sand much faster than topsoil or regular dirt so when you go to replant you want to ""amend"" your soil.  This means digging 1.5-2x deeper, and wider than the pot your plant comes in, and adding a nice topsoil/compost blend to the sandy soil that you remove. You don't want to totally remove the original soil, but more blend the topsoil into the sand so the roots are encouraged to grow past the new topsoil into the native ground.  The topsoil will hold on to water a bit longer than just sand, and give the plants a chance to drink.

"I live in Lakeside about half of a block off of the tracks, the access to the Lakewalk more than makes up for the trains. I think the only crossings they blow their whistle for are HWY 61 and the one near Sammy's. The trains move at less than 20 mph and are short, so they're pretty quiet and don't really get in the way too much. I can barely hear them from my house, but the rhythm is nice.

The advantage to it not being a commercial rail line is that it only runs during the day. It goes off of a tourist schedule, so late starts and done by about 8. They do run 7 days a week in the summer and they probably come through 5-10 times (all of their trips are out and back).

"You say: fuck off

To quote from the Annals of the American Association for Urban Planning from 1914, what I hear is: ""Sterilize the 'jews, catholics, and other subnormal populations'""

Although I highly doubt you will ever admit the policies you advocate for have a disparate racial impact, a cursory glance at the historical record makes it clear that you  are the worst sort of racist which exists in America. Although you may be too cowardly to outright screech 'White Power!' at klan rally, you advocate for same land use policies as the klan. Unfortunately, that does not appear to make you question what sort of impact the policies you advocate for may have.

I am sure that many individuals around town feel quite uncomfortable with the racially exclusionary impact of the policies for which you advocate. These folks agree with your rhetoric, yet they hate the impact of the policies for which you advocate.

It saddens me deeply that you feel acknowledging history and citing the historical record is ""race baiting"" - perhaps, just perhaps, an individual should be judged more for the impact of the policies for which they advocate than the rhetoric they employ to justify their bullshit.

Unlike many in this city full of well-intentioned white folk,, I choose to judge others based upon the impact of their actions.

Put another way: who gives a fuck what politicians like Larosn say? If you live in Duluth and aren't rich enough to afford property, do you feel better off now than you were before Larson took office? Do you pay less in rent? Can you buy more calories with a buck than before Larson began their listening tours and endless 'city hall in the city' dicusions?

Will Essentia and StLukes bankrupt fewer individuals this year than they did when Larson first won with less than 100 votes in 2k11? Between 2020 and today, those two entities accepted over 100 MILLION from the City of Duluth. Do they bankrupt more or less Duluthians than before they took Duluth's 100 million?

Hint: It ain't less. $100 million may not seem like much to the Altworths, the Larsons, the Petersons around town - yet G\_D do I wish I had 1\`00 million to throw around.

When you conduct a database search, you find a plethora of literature published between 1889 and 1920 extolling the indelible delights of the ""white race"" and the need for forced sterilization of certain Zenith City populations.

Who did Duluth's parents and grandparents wish to see lynched and sterilized? Did your parents or grandparents witness any lynchings or forced sterilizations in Duluth? I am sure that many good folk around town would say no. Could Larson's Chief of Police?

Before you continue in your advocacy against the rights of Americans, no matter their racial, ethnic, or cultural identities,  to build their future in our amazing city as they best see fit, I would strongly urge you to read the Annals of history to understand how the northernmost lynching city in America has been able to maintain a 90%+ white population for over 150 years.

Hate me all you want. Great. How many children of lynchers are in positions of policy or power in Duluth today? How many nieces and nephews of lynchers now occupy position of power and authority in our Zenith City?

Can you tell me a number? Because I can tell you a number, and unfortunately, the connection of the modern, 90%+ white Duluth to lynchers ain't 0.

Of this, I am sure: you don't give a shit about our city's history - including the NOT GREAT BITS LIKE LYNCHING - nor do you care about the quantifiable impacts of municipal policy.

What you care about is property valuations and how best to maintain the dominance of the land owning class which presently exists in our city. All bullshit rhetoric and fluff aside, that's the impact of the policies for which you advocate.

But Duluth can do better.

It can do better than the crimes of its ancestors.

Yes, our city's forefathers have committed  some heinous crimes like lynching individuals for their race.

And yet: we can achieve a Zenith City, if only we knew what our city stood for.

There are some values in America which one may hope were universal. Does our city stand for honoring service to America? It's a disaster that someone like me can even ask that question. You shouldn't have to pay $6k ""because that's what pride pays"" to have Noah Schuckman value your service.

Unless you pay the Schuckman price, Duluth doesn't value your service. So can we even say that Duluth values other American ideals like racial integration?

Since 20\`10, rates of racial segregation in Duluth have increased: SEGREGATION IS NOT GOOD!!!! INCREASED RATES OF SEGREGATION ARE NOT A GOOD THING!

I gladly welcome to be proven wrong on any of these matters. All I ask is that you show me the numbers, maybe even show me the money, and not subsist solely upon the rhetoric. I am sure that many individuals wish they could prove me wrong, and demonstration that Duluth pays no moneys to the descendants of lynchers. I wish it as well.

But can you, ShakesSpear? Can you shake your spear and make all the wordplay you'd have us engage in come true? And if you'd say so, please tell me or DM me how - because I think we want the same thing, a Zenith City which achieves the potential for which its named.

I don't know whether it's the steel plant pulling out or the downsizing of the air + naval bases overtime; it seems Duluth has suffered a deep trauma and forgotten that it's able to achieve much better than the lackluster leadership its settled for.",t2_2m5xw3da,migf123,0,1647596091.0,0,t1_i14t6cr,i14t6cr,False,[deleted],t3_tf3eg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/duluth/comments/tf3eg4/need_help_or_advice_with_housing/,Need help or advice with housing,/r/duluth/comments/tf3eg4/need_help_or_advice_with_housing/i14t6cr/,-1,r/duluth,0,-1

"Maybe you aren't familiar with the campsites along the brule. 

Offerings are typical, as the sites are used quite routinely. A sealed container of multi-spice was the first offering I came across, 20 years ago, along with a note explaining how the person who left it once lost their spices to the river and had to suffer through unseasoned tofu. Since then, I've been offered things like jerky, emergency calorie cakes, a waterproof map of the river, flashlight and matches, a love note to a random trout, and a rather beat up looking hatchet that came in clutch. 

Hanging a water/air tight offering on a tree branch or leaning a tool against a tree,while seemingly a terrible thing to do, is a pretty welcome treat for someone who has spent a week on the river.

Definitely is 5th Ave W. This was the heart of the wholesale district. The Stone Ordean Wells building seen in the photo was the first wholesale company in Duluth. It is sitting where bayfront park is today. The slip to the left was filled-in in the 1960s for construction of the new Duluth Arena and Pioneer Hall now the DECC. Pier B would be just out of frame to the far right. The Irvin slip is well out of frame to the left.

"I believe the apartment below me is still available, and has been for quite a while. I live in Downtown Duluth in a great big house that was converted into apartments. The bathroom situation for that apartment is a bit strange since you have to exit your apartment, walk through the entryway sort of area, and then go into the bathroom, but it'd be your own personal bathroom. The landlords are really nice and great people, and the building is well maintained and imo very nice considering the building is quite old. My landlord usually does yearly leases, but she may be interested in renting out short term since she seems to have a hard time finding residents for that space. Oh and there's coin laundry in the basement.

The apartment itself is a decent size. Sort of an ""L"" shape with the kitchen in the middle, a bedroom on one end, and a living room type area on the other. If you're interested send me a PM and I can try to dig up more details.

"I‚Äôm moving to Duluth mostly because I‚Äôm going to physical therapy school here , but being from Idaho I can definitely say being out west has become miserable the last 2 years. My hometown has already been growing rapidly but the pandemic accelerated everything even more so.

Being in a drought and watching more people move here to use water that we don‚Äôt have to spare is hard to watch but understand that Californians have gone through the same thing. It‚Äôs frustrating but I‚Äôm happy to move to Duluth because it‚Äôs not $2200 to rent a 3 bedroom and I‚Äôm excited for new outdoor recreation opportunities that Idaho does not have, even if there are no mountains lol.

"I was a visitor for much of my life and a resident for 3 years. I recently moved away. The tourist's experience of Duluth is very rose-tinted in comparison to the reality (most notable in the fact that the census tract Canal Park lies within has one of the highest poverty rates in the state). Wages are lower than average and there didn't seem to be a ton of growth opportunity in a lot of employment areas. For a city its size, it's lacking in most amenities related to food, art, and culture, but is overflowing with outdoor-oriented activities. It's super easy to get to know everyone, but hard to befriend anyone. The city is beautiful and magical, but I found it very frustrating to exist there with it's resistance to change and new ideas. This permeated everything from politics to my career. As someone more inclined towards city-living, I eventually realized that so many of the qualities I was looking for in a city weren't available in Duluth, though I do feel like there's an accelerating improvement largely due to all the recent newcomers.

"The more I think about this the more impressed I am that they were able to learn the song in less than three weeks. The Twin Ports Wind Ensemble is a highly skilled group of mostly professional musicians or those who excelled at playing in college and high school. The high school players are another story. These are teenagers, some of them 15 and 16 years old. 

I talked to one of them after the show yesterday and she said something like ""I want to study music in college now"" after playing with such gifted mentors.

Funny/interesting aside: A few of the kids asked me if I could light up the stage blue and sunflower yellow for the Ukraine flag. I told them I'd be happy to do that. But the wind ensemble needed the lights basically white because as you get older it is hard to read music and see the director. I am in that age group now where it is hard to see so I tried a few things but ultimately we decided that the unvarnished sentiment of learning the song and playing it with full hearts was enough of a statement.

I did not expect the audience to stand but in the moment it was like ""how could you not?"" Everyone spontaneously rose to their feet and by the end there were a lot of misty eyes in the house. I keep thinking of that line that goes something like ""when words fail, music speaks.""",t2_7j91ubdm,jprennquist,0,1647185983.0,0,t1_i0i2k5b,i0i2k5b,True,jprennquist,t3_tczttr,https://www.reddit.com/r/duluth/comments/tczttr/ukraines_national_anthem_played_by_twin_ports/,Ukraine's National Anthem Played by Twin Ports Wind Ensemble and Denfeld Concert Band Tonight in the Historic Denfeld Auditorium.

Best city drinking water I've ever had, access to plenty of outdoor activities all year long, lots of restaurants, pretty good local music scene (lot of concerts hosted by bars and breweries in the summer, some in winter).  Other than that we have the same problems any city has, too many people shooting up and leaving needles around, junkies like to steal catalytic converters. Usually any violent crimes are pretty isolated. Honestly I couldn't see myself living anywhere else and I've done a decent bit of traveling. Most people that live here and bitch about the city haven't really traveled much to see that we've got a lot more going for us than a lot of places.

I was thinking it‚Äôd be a bit more progressive like Fargo and feel similarly bigger, but not as big as the cities. While in some ways it‚Äôs better in terms of views and outdoors, the town doesn‚Äôt feel as lively and is more spread out which kinda kills any kind of decent sized nightlife.

I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre coming from a smaller town it‚Äôd be great to live in as long as you can afford the housing and/or set expectations lower in what your money will afford you here.

"Totally different. Loans were offered at introductory rates that were majorly low and enticing. They were getting bonuses to prompt them to do that. When those rates bumped up at year three they couldn‚Äôt afford them. Why were bonuses being handed out to offer loans to bad risky customers? Because this loans were being packaged together in securities that were then being rated triple A securities. Those securities were being sold by the banks to major players on Wall Street who looked at the packages and saw AAA and thought well damn that‚Äôs profitable. I‚Äôll buy millions of those. When they actually started defaulting on their loans and the investment firms started looking at what the layers and layers of the packages were actually made up of it was way too late. There was billions of dollars in the market of them. And they were all essentially worthless. Once the first firm collapsed (I think in real life this was Lehman Brothers). The Fed and everyone else realized the shitstorm they were in. Hence too big to fail. That‚Äôs why Bear Stern was bought out by the government. If they hadn‚Äôt done that we could have seen our entire financial system collapse. I‚Äôm taking the Great Depression, dust bowls, worthless paper money, mattresses stuffed full of it. No loans being taken out because of the fear. No one pumping any money back into the system because fear and holding on to it hoping it would regain its value.

The masses act irrationally when those things happen and they do the actual opposite of what is needed in a economic collapse. Instead of taking out more loans, and spending their money, and starting businesses, and making investments. That‚Äôs why the Fed took unprecedented moves to step in.

"There are specific rules about this, and everyone there knows the rules very well, which is why just about everyone there has a camera to record someone making a mistake.

It is considered free speech to ""talk to"" someone about whatever you want, as long as you do not threaten them or block their way or touch them. Walking near them or handing out pamphlets or showing altered, blown up, disgusting pictures of aborted fetuses is apparently included in free speech, though obviously annoying and fucked up. If you block someone's way or follow them to their car, you're walking a line where you can get arrested for harassment or blocking a public thoroughfare.

The reason for the umbrellas is to block the view of the antis cameras if they're taking pictures of patients, stop them from handing out pamphlets if the patient asks for that sort of protection, and to keep them back. The building itself had to build that iron fence and gateway area to more clearly delineate where their private property begins so that they can charge antis with trespassing if necessary.
