"Was not aware about Southeast Health! Lots of growth in Dothan IMO. It seems the pandemic has enabled many fortunate people that now work remotely to seek cheaper areas to live. Dothan is probably the best town in Alabama when it comes to being affordable but not being out in BFE. Honestly an underrated place. Mural city coffee is one of the best coffee shops I’ve ever been to, you got the best Dillards in the state, and Eagle Eye has all the “prep” brands you can imagine. REI Corp or Alabama outdoors can’t even compete. It’s funny when I tell people that I live in bham but have to do my shopping in Dothan, but it’s true!",t2_5egg81yg,W-topher,0,1635192259.0,0,t1_hi0z2if,hi0z2if,False,[deleted],t3_qf6emz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dothan/comments/qf6emz/movingjob_searching_dothan/,Moving/Job Searching- Dothan,/r/Dothan/comments/qf6emz/movingjob_searching_dothan/hi0z2if/,3,r/Dothan,0,3
"All good advice, I just need to mention that Southeast Medical is now called Southeast Health, and they have expanded to many different offices around town. Also, there's a newer apartment complex called Oates Estates by Northside Wal-Mart that is a lot like Fox Run. But westside, which is where Flowers is, has been expanding like crazy the past 5 years or so. I'd move out there given the option. So Highland Hills would be my recommendation.",t2_zs7ke,tbird20017,0,1635191575.0,0,t1_hi0xczp,hi0xczp,False,[deleted],t3_qf6emz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dothan/comments/qf6emz/movingjob_searching_dothan/,Moving/Job Searching- Dothan,/r/Dothan/comments/qf6emz/movingjob_searching_dothan/hi0xczp/,3,r/Dothan,0,3
"From Dothan but now live in Birmingham. You’ll like it down there and both of your educations and job experience will be perfect for this town. Plenty of options for work in these fields. 

You are right, you will have an easy time finding employment. Look at eye center south, heard good things about them as far as pay/benefits. The two big hospitals there are Flowers and Southeast Medical. Though SE Medical is a little newer and has better facilities, I hear the work environment/culture is better at Flowers. (Plus a better side of town for food options on your lunch break!) and then of course there are endless specialty clinics/outpatient services. 

For your BF, I wish I had better places to name by name, but I’m just not very connected in that space. I does seem that EVERYONE works in the trades down there. There a ton of general warehousing/logistics/trucking companies down there. For welding, ever heard of trailer world? They are actually headquartered in Dothan. They build trailers. Theres a Johnson controls location in Dothan, too. There’s a ton more I just don’t know it all by name. In all honesty- it’s an employees market right now, especially in the trades so I wouldn’t stress too much about it. Sounds like you two are going to be able to have a pretty high quality of life down there because again, you both have the ideal skills for Dothan. This will be even more compounded by the low cost of living there.

Housing- you pretty much got it spot on as far as affordable/budget apts that aren’t the ghetto. All four of those are respectable, safe, clean, and in good areas. One you are missing in this category is highlands trail apartments- a little outside of town but in the same price point and they are quite nice. I guess it will just come down to price and which one you just like the most. However, I’d just briefly consider magnolia preserve or highland hills. These two are probably a little more than your target rent, but they are the more fancy places to live that still offer good value. Idk your situation and just general rent preference, so I don’t mean to assume too much, but splitting an apt two ways with the two of you likely to find good paying jobs- I don’t think it would be at all wasteful to live in one of those. Particularly Magnolia Preserve, the location is literally perfect. Starbucks, Publix, hobby lobby, and my favorite local clothing store, eagle eye, all within walking distance. Plus it’s practically the center of town so work commutes will be less of a factor. 

On the topic of commuting- two other towns your bf could consider is Ozark and Enterprise- (25 min and 40 min commutes, respectively) theres some really good employment up there too. Especially enterprise with the military base being up there! 

I am sure you are going to like Dothan!

"Heartbreaking update from the rescue:

Nala update- The dreaded post that no parent ever wants to make. Part of Nalas body was recovered today. She’s been deceased since 8/6 (the day after the Malone’s started their adoption trial). 

I’m so sorry we failed to do our job and keep you safe as we promised u 2.5 years ago when we rescued you. I’m sorry your last moments u felt scared instead of loved. I’m sorry we weren’t there to hold your paw as you crossed over this life. Most of all I’m sorry there is monsters in this world that have no regard for life. YOUR LIFE MATTERED. And your life will continue to matter to us 

We will be pursuing both civil & criminal charges on the Malone family. What they did to Nala is to disturbing for details. I want to say thank you to Washington County PD & Chipley Animal Control for going above & beyond today & giving us the closure Nala deserved. 

Today 8/27 marks the end of this search but the beginning of a fight for justice. We will not rest until the Malone’s are held accountable for their actions. 

HUGE Thank You to ALL of YOU who took the time to share Nala & offer assistance. I know she would be amazed on how she made an entire world that seems to be so divided right now come together for one sole purpose. Never underestimate the power of love & unity 💕

‼️We will be putting together a Memorial for Nala near the Malone’s property so a day doesn’t go by that they don’t see Nalas contagious smile. If u would like to contribute or be apart of it please shoot us a DM and we will add u to the group‼️

As of today FBLR will be taking a pause on rescue. We want to focus solely on getting Nala the justice she deserves as well as the current dogs in our foster program.

"Terrible idea, restraints specialize because there are different styles of education and traits to different foods. 
I don’t want my local Italian restaurant to make hamburgers. Nor do I want my burger place to make lasagna... probably cause it won’t be that good. 
Sourcing supplies would also become much more difficult. 
Higher end restaurants, where foods does actually cost $30, are like that because it’s more expensive to source locally and for only the next week.  
A place that can afford to run an app and sell 2$ meals doesn’t exist because it’s nonsensical. 

Land could be utilized better, sure. But it’s not restaurants that cause the problems. It’s poor zoning, laws that affect multi-use, such as a residence above commercial, etc that are the problems.

Also, chains, which can afford to sell 2$ meals aren’t usually owned by locals, nor do they change their menu because of the infrastructure that allows to source that cheaply.

"Honestly it may not be right next to Troy Dothan but pretty close and a great bang for your buck in an ideal area of Dothan are the Park at Ashburn apartments by Westgate Park.

"Having worked in a program that housed/assisted with some of the suspects of these shootings, I can tell you that a lot of these younger suspects were not given a fair chance during their sentence by these programs. They were written off from the beginning and viewed as lost causes. Their probation officers aren't monitoring them closely either as it's really easy to see that they're still involved in gang related activities. Luckily, there has been an effort by some of the older generation to start doing legalized backyard boxing and water fights in effort to cut down on this gun violence and gang activity, but some of these kids are too far gone to notice.

"There has not been a simple explanation released as to why exactly any of this is being done. People who’ve figured it up can see the realignment makes all of the schools in Dothan considered “poverty level” or whatever you want to call it. The city gets more money for schools that are classified as that since most of those children receive free lunch. Since they will not release info as to why this was done, we can only assume it was primarily for money. Why else would a city close literally some of the best and highest scoring schools in the entire state? In return it is driving people away from Dothan and causing others to not want to move here.

It has potential to drastically affect Dothan in such a bad way. We may not see it as much at first, but think of how ppl reviewing cities to move will see Dothan when they research schools and see the new info available? Would that be a system you want your kids in? All schools under poverty level, *and assuming here*- a lot of them will end up with next to failing scores or at minimum we won’t have any that are in comparison to the ones we do now. Mixing in kids with good grades isn’t the solution to this problem. This is going to harm the children that currently have the good grades. Not that they are better than any other child, but if they are that far ahead, how do you think they are going to handle sitting in class while the rest are being taught things that could take a couple years to catch up?

I have no children, so I can look at this objectively; from each prospective and I still can’t make sense of this. We will start to see in this next year what the effects will be. But it is already being noticed by teachers seeing kids being pulled from school and started in other local county schools or private schools in the area. What’s done now can’t be undone. Ppl are not going to switch their children back and forth between schools.

As for the pre-K, I need more info on that system. I do think it’s great that you get children will be educated, but as long as it’s done correctly and for the right reasons. At least maybe they can use one of the old school buildings for that?

The high school situation, that baffles my mind. I went to a local county school so I’m not biased on Dothan High or Northview. I don’t understand how a city the size of Dothan is going to operate with ONE high school. 

I will sit back and watch this unfold because the school board has voted and made their decisions ignoring the fact that MULTIPLE ppl have questioned them [*with no response*] and offered to help find solutions.",t2_1xbx7r1r,Seemoore90,0,1546097309.0,0,t1_ect16hl,ect16hl,False,Seemoore90,t3_aajbwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dothan/comments/aajbwn/dothan_is_making_great_headlines_all_over_not/,"Dothan is making “great” headlines all over!

"This is something I think about a lot actually.

Taj has a surprisingly good gyro, though it's not completely traditional. It's more like their tandoori chicken in a huge pita, but it is very good. If you're not looking for something strictly Greek, I think it's the best gyro dish in town.

Taziki's is legit too. It's a chain but they do good, traditional-type gyros. +1 for having dolmas on the menu too, which I don't think you can find anywhere else in town.

And shockingly, though I can't believe I'm recommending this, Arby's greek gyros are spot-on flavor wise. The flavor reminds me of the grungy small Greek cafes I used to frequent; super-greasy but tasty, heavy on the seasoning. I hope they keep these on the menu; it's the only reason I go there.

And Which Wich has a gyro that's pretty good too. Nothing spectacular.

"Basically anywhere that is not the east side or center of town is good. There are really no “bad” neighborhoods that I know of. Just neighborhoods with different levels of affluence. For example, my brother lives a couple of blocks from a housing project downtown and I would not mind at all living in his neighborhood because it’s very safe and friendly. So when I say a side of Dothan is “good” I just mean that it is more obviously middle class.

"I had to give up my firstborn son when he was born on May 10, 1994 at Medical Center Enterprise. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I’ve spent many years in sorrow and grief over having to put him up for adoption.

I was 23 years old, and more naive than I’d like to admit. But I was smart enough to know that I wouldn’t be a good parent at that time. I wasn’t ready. Back then, I didn’t think I’d ever be ready. But I would have kept him if his biological mom would have allowed it. I wish I had fought harder for him, but she was committed to adoption. Even though I loved him at first sight--and the few pictures that I have of us together are some of my most treasured memories--I acquiesed. I knew he’d have a better home and a better life without me at the time.

But I’ve never forgotten him, nor forgiven myself for not fighting harder for him.

Catholic Social Services in Dothan handled the adoption, and they will not tell me anything. The adoption is closed, and the records are sealed. There was a nun there named Sister Lucy Smoker who told me a few things about his new parents, even though it was against the rules, and about his first name, which she said the parents didn’t plan on using. I believe he was adopted by a couple who were living in the Montgomery area.

I would like to find the boy. Well, the young man, now. He’s 24. I’m 47 now. His biological grandparents are aging rapidly, and their one wish is to meet him. I have that same wish, and something more. I would like to tell him I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the parent--the father--I should have been. I would like to introduce him to my wife, and to his brothers.

I don’t know that he wants to be found. I don’t even know if he’s alive. If he doesn’t, I will have to understand that and live with the regrets I have. They won’t be any heavier than they already are.

If you recognize this precious kiddo from his baby photos--sent to me by his adoptive parents through Catholic Social Services--please DM me with any information you have.

"Glad to hear it. Real estate prices have been trending up in Dothan since 2008, and i've been surprised at the price rise the past 18 or so months. The west side is better than the east side in this regard, but deals can be had (I know of a house near you FSBO, that sell below market most likely). Further west, like in Wicksburg, has seen pretty crazy price jumps the past couple of years just for land. 
I don't know of any major things coming up that might mean a big growth push for the area. In my business, we've watched many of our clients grow over the years, so locally, businesses seem to be doing well enough to invest in their businesses. 
Dothan keeps trying to encourage growth to the east, but the people tend to push to the west - lots of retail growth west of town due to higher incomes and convenience for those who live in Enterprise and Ft. Rucker area. There is talk of Costco, and perhaps other retailers planting a flag locally on the west half of town, but nothing concrete yet. The medical center, SAMC, is developing 22 acres across the street from flowers hospital sometime. They bought the land last year. I kinda like that growth isn't exploding and prices aren't out of control. During the real estate crash in 2007, prices didn't suffer all that much around here. the stayed flat, then rose gradually around 2008 - 2016, then accelerated after that.

"You are welcome.
https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/al/dothan/crime  I have to agree w/ this overview - the lighter colors are the worst. Most of the crime is simple assaults, petty drugs, crap like that. Meth is a thing here, and heroin is moving up the charts. Where that apt complex near SAMC is, I think it's just lumped in with other neighborhoods north and west of there. I forgot one apt complex - Magnolia Preserve, it's by one of the movie theaters - really nice apt complex. Only a few years old. If I was moving to Dothan and wanted an apt. that is where I would move, either there or Highland Hills. I will specifically some folks who will know for sure about the area around the hospital as far as crime.

The general area around SAMC is on the older side, but there are some nice neighborhoods too, esp when you get out 84E. The sketchy parts are generally inside the circle. Just know that like everywhere else, the criminals will get mobile on occasion and leave their neighborhoods. Every few years we get a rash of petty thefts in apartment complexes, mostly people just hitting up cars and apt's left unlocked.",t2_65oea6o,Realtimemsp,0,1520890539.0,0,t1_dvlhq7q,dvlhq7q,False,[deleted],t3_83y6c1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dothan/comments/83y6c1/moving_do_dothan_three/,Moving do Dothan Three!!!,/r/Dothan/comments/83y6c1/moving_do_dothan_three/dvlhq7q/,2,r/Dothan,0,2
"There are some decent places popping up on that side of town, but only one good apt complex, Beverlye Crossing, only a few blocks from SAMC. Almost all of the nice ones are on the west side of town - Highland Hills (very new) and Highlands Trail apts are good. Princeton place is pretty good as well. The rest - meh to no freakin' way.

That said, you can rent a town home or house for about what apartments run in Dothan.

Most shopping is on the west side of town, just due to the way Dothan has grown over the years and proximity to Ft Rucker. As a general rule, crime is highest near the middle of town. 
Dothan keeps trying to force growth out the east side of town, but so far its slow progress.

I'm not sure what else you might be looking for advice wise, but just shout out and I'll answer what I can. I've lived here for ~17yrs, so I'm not a native, but know my way around. there are well over 300 restaurants in town, so she won't starve, and there is a pretty decent Japanese place right by SAMC.

"On my experience, Troy Cable's issues seem to come from trying to expand too quickly with their fiber and high speed internet services without very good planning. That article is a perfect example. I want to say it comes from a general lack of experience in being in the high speed business. They have a 1990's mindset in a 2017 internet world. 

I tried to give them a chance because they had affordable prices and had the more reliable network - if you were lucky enough to have the level of service you want available at your home.

"People are fairly closed off here, nearly all my friends are work acquaintances and some family friends. A lot of it has to do with the nature of the town - a lot of people just pass through either traveling to Florida or training with the Army and not very permanent. 

Plus, Dothan has not really made any strives towards establishing social venues or developments friendly to amenities you would find in towns of similar size elsewhere. The city knows this, but I feel like the money just isn't there for many of the projects they want to bring into fruition. 

That being said, I always have infinitely better luck exploring Enterprise on the weekends. There are a lot of nice venues downtown that is more conductive to meeting new people. At the same time, a lot of people I have met that way are associated with the Army and eventually move away. Either way, that town has definitely gotten on board more with the times and has nice walkable areas with bars, restaurants, and I believe they have a brewery somewhere but I have not yet been.

"It's a shame that Dothan has the potential to follow the trends of other smaller towns that redevelop their downtown areas with bars/restaurants/etc yet not a young enough population to really push such things. I think lack of efficient infrastructure really hurts the city in that regard. As I recall, once upon a time there were plans to attract a minor league baseball team complete with stadium and such.. It was an accepted idea but at the same time rejected because no one believed Dothan could handle the traffic downtown (they're probably right). A major attraction like that could help bring enough money in to support a redeveloped downtown, but the initial investment amounts are a bit prohibitive. 

Another factor is that during the summer months no one wants to hang around Dothan for the weekends when we have all these awesome Florida destinations within easy reach.

Dive/pool? -  Houligans.  Standard and cheap.  One of the few you can actually smoke in. Also it stays open the latest,  given after 2 it becomes a black shirt social from the service industry 

Craft and food?  -  KTs Tavern -  Jason's pizza is spot on and they have a nice craft selection to choose from

"Well, the weather changes all the time this time of year. Hot and humid one day, cold as balls the next. Pollen is everywhere this time of year.

True that's why we are kinda just scoping it out. We thing a bar that catered to a different kinda crowd might work. Something non redneck. Non drunks with loud music blaring.

Our idea is something along those lines. Something to cater to the 21-35 market that would give people a place to go hang out drink beers. People that don't like the bar/club scene.
