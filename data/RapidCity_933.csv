"I have a close friend, she loves Rapid and the area. BUT... here's the the reality of current housing is western SD: You will be competing with either military people or people in their 50 and 60s with deeper pockets. They are paying above asking price sight unseen for land that is only rock and pine needles. Water is hard to find too outside towns. The winters there are extremely cold some years with hardly any summer except for 2 months. Only wyoming and eastern MT are more windy if you look at wind avg maps. The last 2 winters in SD have been crazy warm and drought. That will end at some point. Most these home buyers will move to the south like they normally do, as it is a summer tourist area. Lots of bikers and families traveling thru there. These old farts buying overpriced homes/cabins will sit on their purchases until they get too old to deal with renting and airbnb, or they get sick of the property tax (SD is one of the highest in the country). Until then you are probably out of luck. The area is growing, but most young people don't stay historically. That will probably get worse because they are really getting priced out of the market. Wintersports are usually terrible and it is very windy in that region almost every day. There really is not much value to these people moving their other than right wing politics and some hills with pine trees to look at. A lot of places in the West are going thru transformations but the local economies are not on a sustainable track because it is mostly retiring people who move there and service workers can no longer afford to live in areas like Black Hills or Rapid City.

"Yeah, their argument was that people could just buy flower and make it at home, which ignores a lot of the strengths of proper manufacturing, labeling, and packaging.  Proper dosing is much easier with things that are manufactured to meet consistency standards, and are properly labeled with the specific amounts of different ingredients.  Edibles made at home don't have proper labeling and packaging either, making most of what they claim, as far as unsuspecting children eating the edibles, even more possible.  Like you said, most legal states, even recreational, still sell in child-proof packaging that are labeled with ingredients, including possible allergens.  The same as prescription drugs that are currently in people's houses and medicine cabinet.

"I (amatuer) tudy a lot of midwest climates. Some comments here are telling you to live in Rapid for 6 months to get an an idea of local climate...well...

Unfortunately this will not do you any good because Rapid City is located on a downwind slope just on the northeast edge of the Black Hills, which is called ""island in the plains"".

This winter and last the ""Hills"" (as the region is called) has been experiencing a drought and unusual warm temps. Go back a few yrs and we had 3-4 ft of snowpack around much of the area. Some winters is snows from Oct - May and is below normal (normal is usually fairly cold to California standards). 

Summers can be cold too. Then one week everything changes. There are always harsh wind storms that usually happen 2 - 5 times per year, with damaging winds 60 - 90 MPH. 

Rapid City avoids some snow because it is in a rain shadow, but the city's location gets the worst of the winds and cold, coming from the Northwest. 

So talk to people that have actually lived in a location for at least 5 yrs. That is a typical el nino cycle, which determines the climate extremes one year from another.",t2_4emffgr1,finally_independent,0,1642195532.0,0,t1_hsojj3y,hsojj3y,True,TeamDartos,t3_qlgy1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/RapidCity/comments/qlgy1a/winter_weather/,Winter Weather,/r/RapidCity/comments/qlgy1a/winter_weather/hsojj3y/,1,r/RapidCity,0,1

most of us natives want it removed i mean legally our tribes still owns the black hills but we aren't getting none of that back i guess there was talks of offers of millions going to the tribes for all of the black hills but most of them don't want it cause our ancestors are buried in the hills and that is not worth millions i mean so much for gold i assume since money is what makes the world function but i guess they are tryna recognize our people by putting someone on the mount Rushmore but then again i think that it don't make us forget the fact that our culture was pretty much illegal till 1978 when Jimmy Carter signed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act but that also that also does not defeat the point of our people being forced into Christianity and forced to cut our hair like we don't see it as what white folks see it we just look at it as the 1st genocide not only one our culture but our people like if you think about it who in the hell starts a damn war over a damn ghost dance we gave them the land and it was not by free will but by force but still to this day we feel that impact and to most white folks since they put us on a rez like in modern times when they look in and see how we live you see our people on drugs or they are drunks but most of that happen from boarding schools and our elders trying to find escape from emotional pain and them habits are passed down generation by generation like the church wont even recognize that they did wrong? and they wont bring to light that there was body's found on the grounds of the boarding schools like not only was our culture and people are killed so was our children and in fact i should say my great grandmothers and grandfathers who died young over the man of god a book of fables and fiction i just don't understand why was our culture a sin when all we wanna do is take care of the earth and its resources and take care of our people but besides my rant and my mini history lesson i think instead of praising genocide and murders they need to teach that America was not only built on the backs of the black folks but it was built on the blood of my ancestors but that is some things they don't teach in school but i bet you 5 bucks the old IHS building aka the Sioux san over on the west side has children on there grounds buried too so i don't see this mount Rushmore as a accomplishment i see it in a different way its all dead presidents who take what they want when they feel like it,t2_5nk7avv3,bashmyskull100,1,1636855645.0,0,t1_hkj7uf7,hkj7uf7,False,Wetworth,t3_qt8an3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RapidCity/comments/qt8an3/keystone_sd_the_mountain_known_in_lakota_as/,"Keystone, SD: the mountain known in Lakota as Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe, or Six Grandfathers, is Mount Rushmore today. ~1905 [1600x1246]",/r/RapidCity/comments/qt8an3/keystone_sd_the_mountain_known_in_lakota_as/hkj7uf7/,4,r/RapidCity,0,4

"I am very aware of the tourist surge. I’ve done quite a bit of research over the past few months about Rapid City specifically and South Dakota as a whole. I did not however know about the 2 jobs on a permanent basis, that is definitely a con that my family and I will weigh against the other pros and cons.

If not for a job, most people move because they are uncomfortable in their own state, especailly given the political climate our country has faced these past couple elections. Nearly every city in this nation has a housing crisis, you’re not alone. Tourism is a major industry in California, especially the Bay Area. And yeah sure, it doesn’t drive our economy to the extent it does in Rapid City. Kind of sounds like you hate it there, why don’t you move to another state?

If you can’t see a reason why people are leaving California, you’re not paying attention. First off, our Governor Newsom is horrendous and has been abusing his executive order power for the past year and a half with backwards mandates that he himself violates. Secondly, our homeless population is one of the highest in the nation. When’s the last time you walked by a pile of human poop in your downtown area? I’d guess never. It’s a common occurrence in SF. Thirdly, our corporate offices are leaving in droves because of the excessive taxes and policies our state government imposes on them. This will lead to a huge decrease in tax revenue to operate the state. I could go on, but there’s plenty of info/videos on YouTube explaining this much better than I can. In summary, California is turning into a ****hole quickly and we’re trying to get out before we have to go upside down on our house",t2_5n49rbd,TeamDartos,0,1635955570.0,0,t1_hj5w6pn,hj5w6pn,False,TeamDartos,t3_qlgy1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/RapidCity/comments/qlgy1a/winter_weather/,Winter Weather,/r/RapidCity/comments/qlgy1a/winter_weather/hj5w6pn/,1,r/RapidCity,0,1
"As Stewdman said, this is not a conservative safe haven. 

We have a housing crisis here, and you want to make it worse for us because you are uncomfortable in your own home state?

Did you know that South Dakota leads the nation with residents who have two or more jobs on a permanent basis? Can you figure out why that is? Hint: Tourists.

Tourism is the major industry in western South Dakota. Think about jobs that serve tourism for a moment. Hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, and the tourist attractions themselves have a much higher volume of workload during our well defined tourist season. There are tons of low paid jobs to be had in the summer, but those jobs dry up, and the income the tourist industry generates, when tourist season is over. Hotels close off rooms or close down completely for the season, as do gift shops and other seasonal businesses. 

Oh and by the way, the area is always invaded by bikers in August. No, they don't just stay in Sturgis. For about two weeks, traffic sucks, the rumble of motorcycles is incessant, and we are constantly worried about our loved ones being involved in an accident. Shopping sucks, you can't get a seat at a bar or restaurant, and we have to put up with drunken tourists on motorcycles.

"The good news about Rapid City is that it is sunny (200+ days per year are clear or partly cloudy) and for long stretches in **most** winters, there isn't that much snow to deal with.

**However,** Rapid City has very unpredictable seasonal weather.  If I had to break down the issues you might encounter, both in the winter and in summer, it's these:

1. Western South Dakota gets most precipitation in the fall and spring.  Combined with varied temperatures, that means you could see 3-4 days of constant rain or  3-4 days of snow being measured by the foot, not by the inch.
2. Temperature varies considerably.  In the winter, temperatures can get down well below -20F (sometimes as low as -50F).  In the summer, temperatures can rise above 110F with strings of 95F and above days being common.  Temperature can even vary between night and day since western SD is a steppe climate.
3. Wind is nearly constant.  Rapid City itself doesn't experience that much wind since it is sheltered by the Black Hills.  But once you get a couple miles from the foothills, the wind is blowing.  The wind is driven by solar heating of the landscape, so it pretty much blows any time the sun is up **or** when there is a storm front coming through.  It's not as bad as Wyoming, but it's pretty close.
4. Blizzards, fires, flash floods, Tornados, and hurricane-like winds all occur in western South Dakota.  As I said, Rapid City is fairly sheltered but if you live outside city limits you are going to have to deal with at least two of these issues every year.  Hail is especially a big problem.

I was born in west-central Minnesota, so dealing with all these issues is second nature to me.

"Well in this case it IS some one else’s fault... why else would there be so much PPP, EIDL, and other absurd amounts of govt money. You don’t give business owners trillions to close because it’s “good for business.” It’s quite the admission of failed policy. 

Free markets are just that, free of gov’t intervention. You can’t call mandated closures a “free market,” where the best ideas compete in the marketplace. The lack of a marketplace - and total absence of such competition due to a heavy-handed government - is the antithesis of a free market’s tenets.

But perhaps it was meant to be. We learned of the failures of Gov Jared Polis as a human and a leader. We researched freer lands, and picked SD to start over. And perhaps it was all for the best - we’re already up and running here in Rapid and well in the black. Demonstrating once again...

As long as you aren’t here during a major winter storm, you’ll be fine as the black hills has a very efficient snow removal crew.

"The two main decent providers in town are Midcontinent and Vast Broadband. Midco will generally cost you a little bit more but you’ll almost always have more reliable Docsis service with them. Vast docsis is better for the deals and discounts they promote, you can get gig for $60/mo vs midco gig for $85/mo+. Vast does not take very good care of most of their Ariel coax cable and this causes reliability issues for folks especially if your on the end of a line. Midco tends to take care of their lines and does regular maintenance on them. To Vast’s credit though, they inherited a network that was bought and sold at least four times and they’ve done a ton of upgrades since they bought into the territory. I’m pretty lucky to have both a vast and midco fiber optic node within 500ft of the house so either one is rock solid docsis connection in my specific instance, takes some trial and error. In the last year I have had one 45 minute outage at about 11pm on a Saturday with vast and have had no outages with Midco. 

Now, if your outside of city limits, you’re kind of limited with your provider choice. CenturyLink is available around most of the county but is very often unreliable and has high latency. Never seen a CTL connection out here get more than 15mbps reliably. Sometimes you’ll win the lottery and live right next to a DSL fiber node. If you know that information and can verify with a tech that you live within a 1000ft of one, you might get lucky and have decent internet from them. Very rare from what I’ve seen although they are placing a bunch more of these fiber nodes around the hills. I know of exactly one neighborhood that has Centurylink FTTH out past Errickson ranch road but have yet to talk to anybody out there about it. Heard good things though.

Midco does not have any FTTH deployments in the black hills from what I’m aware of.

I know of at least two FTTH deployment projects that vast have completed, one is on highway 16 around the Old Macdonald’s farm area and the other is out near box elder along I-90

Most likely though, Centurylink just isn’t gonna cut it. I’d go have a look at Celerity Broadband as they are a Fixed Wireless provider using Ubiquiti equipment and serve a good chunk of the outer city limits. They have a map on their website to show coverage. Have a friend using them and it generally works pretty well. They’ve had a couple nasty outages over the years so be prepared to have a backup connection if your day to day work depends on it. The best plan celerity has is 40mbps for about $120/mo. They also offer FTTH in a select few subdivisions but I haven’t heard much about it. Starlink may be a better option for you if you can get it.

Another fixed wireless provider is Western Communications, they use some older Motorola canopy equipment and their best plan is 30mbps for $93/mo. Haven’t used them before so I can’t say much else about them.

And for the love of god, please avoid Mt. Rushmore Tel DSL internet at all costs, they bought territory that CenturyLink didn’t want and then just never upgraded anything and charge more than they should. You can’t get anything better than 20mbps in downtown keystone even on a good day and latency has anyways been 200ms+

"They're not wrong. Being nice in politics won't accomplish anything. Remember the Tea Party? They were hated by establishment Republicans but they got their agendas through by being dicks and playing hardball(withholding their vote).

What does being nice get you when you're trying to influence those within your party? Ask the Squad. AOC and her cohorts are always asking Pelosi nicely to ""please listen to our progressive asks"" and look where that has gotten them.  No Medicare 4 All. No student Debt forgiveness. More taxpayer money to Isreal for their iron dome. More funding for [capitol] police. Whipping refugees at the border by people on horseback. Still drone striking innocent children.....

If you need further proof that being a dick works look at how Queen Kyrsten Sinema and King Joe Manchin are able to completely set the narrative on the infrastructure bill by being douche bags.

I was a Bernie supporter and my number one critique of him was that he was too fucking nice. Kept talking about ""his good friend Joe"" and not calling people out for their shortcomings. He bent over backwards trying not to step on people's toes and the media still labeled him as a misogynist  and grumpy old man. He should have taken the gloves off. Trump didn't hold back punches against Hillary and he became president. 

You might not like it but being a turd is absolutely a viable political tactic. Did you see the video of Nancy Pelosi making AOC cry? Nancy wasn't sharing a no bake cookie recipe with AOC..... she was ripping her a new asshole and AOC quickly changed her vote from NO to PRESENT.

ATM machines will be shut off.

Property may be nationalized.

"You’ll hate it, I promise. The Black Hills and Badlands National Park are the only redeeming features and even those are shit on (metaphorically and otherwise) by the massive tourism industry. It would be different if the residents benefited at all from that revenue, but we don’t. Roads are shit, services are shit, and the governor just doesn’t care. 

Wages are outrageously low compared to the cost of living. There’s no income tax, but higher property taxes to make up for it. 

Homelessness and crime are also big problems here. Last year, someone managed to steal like 40 guns from a gun shop. They broke in with a hammer. And our AG killed a pedestrian, tried to cover it up with a cop he knows, and somehow managed to get away with just a $3500 fine and he still has his job.

independent ale house opens at 3pm. they have a huge selection of beer, and their pizzas are top notch. keep in mind that what's written on the board is not all of the beers, they also have a bank of coolers behind the bar filled with bottles and cans of all sorts of beers...the drekker section is particularly tasty.  

i personally live for the end of august/early september because that's when they have their heirloom tomato pizza made with these huge honking tomatoes grown specifically for them by the chef's parents. i realize tomatoes aren't for everyone, but their other pizzas are just as good. my other favorites are the hasselhoff, dub's thai, and three little pigs.",t2_kpwgv,bubba_feet,0,1631031277.0,0,t1_hby33ra,hby33ra,True,LetsConsultTheMap,t3_pjq101,https://www.reddit.com/r/RapidCity/comments/pjq101/visiting_today/,Visiting today!,/r/RapidCity/comments/pjq101/visiting_today/hby33ra/,12,r/RapidCity,0,12
"I used to play in a band or two a while back. The biggest issue, in my group's opinion, was that the shows downtown would book like... 4-6 acts. Everyone's friends show up for their set and leave, then the actual headliners (usually out state) show up to play at 1030/1130 to a crowd of mostly opening acts.

In general though - it's a bummer how dead this area is when it comes to the arts. The comedy open mic has no goddamn promotion behind it so it's the same eight people. Hell, when they did the comedy festival this summer there was barely any mention of it. 

I'm working a music festival/art market this weekend and I just heard about it two days ago from a facebook ad.

"Late to the party on this, but it's highly recommended for a new shooter to spend some time with an actual instructor if they care about becoming proficient. Bad advice can lead to bad habits becoming ingrained in a new shooter, and there are a ton of people who have been ""shooting their whole life"" and aren't particularly good at it.

NRA Basic Pistol or a state concealed carry class are a great place to start, but I would genuinely suggest looking for instructors who have certified beyond that level; it says they're devoted to their craft AND care about being able to teach properly, too.

As far as places to shoot, other people have touched on Smoking Gun (which also isn't a bad place to find a class) ND Fall River Gun Club, these work well. I'd stay away from Beretta Road; it tends to be full of the aforementioned people who have been ""shooting their whole life"" out there committing some uncomfortable safety violations.

"They left because Nick Tilson enjoys causing chaos, the point where the video picks up they were just finishing (citation signing it appeared) there wasn't a need to be there. 

It is interesting though, in conducting that traffic stop they pulled over and stood in the parking lot, that keeps the officers and the driver of the stopped vehicle (and any passengers) out of the road thereby lowering the chances of being struck by a vehicle, Why would Tilson make a scene and want people to stand on the road and increase the likelihood of injury? 

If Tilson is so sure that the officers are trespassing why didn't he come up and simply ask for their names (or look at their vests, it's on their name plates) and then ask them to leave. If they did cool, if they didn't he could go to court over it and if he was in the right he could get a judgement. He escalated this a ton by flying in and starting yelling.

"I lived on East Adams St right across the street from YFS back when it used to be the food bank. I had my fair share of bad experiences, ranging from my truck being shot in the middle of the night, to a person on drugs breaking the window in my front door in an attempt to come inside one night during a board game session with friends. I've seen people play drunk chicken on North Maple St, driving at each other in the middle of the night with their headlights off.   


It's definitely a wild area, but during my time of the west side I've had my truck broken into 3 times, my vehicles have been egged, my neighbor had his house paintballed multiple times, and a friend that lives not far from here had someone break into her house and steal her dog. But it's still the north side that gets multiple cruiser patrols at a time, all night, every night.   


I agree that there are very good times for officers to be on the north side. It IS a dangerous area. I do also think that the heavier the police presence in any area, the more likely you are to find someone breaking the law. If I spend hours scouring my back yard and only a few minutes in the front, of course I'll find more worms. That doesn't necessarily mean there are more worms in the back, just that I spent more time trying to find them. I do not have enough proof this applied to law enforcement, but it is something I am trying to learn more about.   


I completely agree with your last paragraph. I just want to make sure that interactions that start with a rude cop pulling a citizen over for a broken tail light don't escalate because of a rude cop. And that's mostly what I've filmed. I am not looking to get involved in a suspect chase, or a trauma case with EMTs on scene. I want to make sure basic day to day interactions stay as basic day to day interactions, and there isn't an abuse of power.",t2_e3lz3dm3,FocusonThePolice,0,1629858922.0,0,t1_ha8tkjd,ha8tkjd,False,FocusonThePolice,t3_pa9wvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/RapidCity/comments/pa9wvd/filming_police_in_public/,Filming Police in Public,/r/RapidCity/comments/pa9wvd/filming_police_in_public/ha8tkjd/,1,r/RapidCity,0,1

"I do not agree with spending close to 2 million dollars for a police office space.

"My intention so far has been to be a presence and to record the interactions with as little disruption as possible. In my head I'm kind of thinking of a narration from David Attenborough, ""Tonight we see the Rapid City Officer out patrolling. It is suspicious of the Citizen it is interacting with. Let's see how these two work together to maintain a society..."" and I imagine myself as a photographer trying to disrupt the interaction as little as possible so that I can record an authentic interaction.  


My understanding of the situation, which could be wrong, from the discussions I've had with officers is they would prefer if I were not involved, and in my opinion they would prefer I don't film or post anything.   


If something exceptionally negative happens, whether that is an officer's actions or a non officer's actions, I would want the public to know about that regardless of the opinions of the people being filmed. In this case I would share the information to allow for accountability of the actions taken.   


If something exceptionally positive happens, and those involved agree they would like it to be shared, then I would of course try to share that publicly as well. But if something positive happens and those involved do not want it posted publicly, I would do my best to respect their wishes.   


I do think there is a difference between deciding to share my recordings based on a very negative interaction, and a very positive one. But I am open to changing that view point, and if I've misunderstood the officers I've talked to, I would have no problem mentioning by name the officers I think have treated me very professionally and kindly.   


I do not have a youtube channel, nor do I really post on any social media, though I do have a facebook page to follow friends. I would most likely only go out of my way to create a youtube channel or upload a video to facebook if I felt an action was required and my recordings could help make that action happen.   


To date, even though there have been good, bad, and neutral interactions, I don't feel I've seen anything worth creating an issue over or going out of my way to applaud, and I feel like uploading at this point would not help me form a positive relationship with the officers or non officers I am filming.   


I have shared videos with people I've filmed upon reasonable request, and would share the videos with the RCPD if the situation required it and they gave a reasonable request.",t2_e3lz3dm3,FocusonThePolice,0,1629857905.0,0,t1_ha8rftw,ha8rftw,False,FocusonThePolice,t3_pa9wvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/RapidCity/comments/pa9wvd/filming_police_in_public/,Filming Police in Public,/r/RapidCity/comments/pa9wvd/filming_police_in_public/ha8rftw/,1,r/RapidCity,0,1
