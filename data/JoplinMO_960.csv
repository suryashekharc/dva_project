"Joplin isn't like a lot of larger cities where there is a more defined good and bad side of town. You'll find nicer neighborhoods all over and some junky/sketchy areas scattered about as well. The only large swaths I'd say to avoid the 10 or 20 blocks west of main between \~2nd and \~20th and east of main along Broadway. Those two areas seem to be hotbeds of crime. 

You should be able to get a decent home in a good neighborhood in your price range. But probably not in Briarbrook or Heritage Acres or some of the other more coveted areas. Prices have risen a lot here lately. Homes even very nice ones used to be quite affordable and I guess they still are compared to many areas of the country but it's nuts how much prices have risen.

According to a realtor friend of mine the area is seeing a LOT of people moving here from California and Colorado, two high priced markets and those people are driving up prices by outbidding locals, paying prices that seem reasonable to them but are high for this area. I'm also told there are also out of state ""investment groups"" that buy up homes and sit on them for a couple years then sell them. Which probably isn't helping either since it would be tying up housing inventory that's already in short supply.

If you like to walk dogs there is a nice neighborhood off Zora (just north) that is near the Frisco trail. Some decent areas near it in Webb City too but south of Zora the trail is surrounded by pretty sketchy areas. 

There is also the Ruby Jack trail if you prefer a quieter walk. Some areas in Carl Junction and Oronogo and Carthage have easy access to it. I also like the kind of older neighborhood with the curved streets that fork from Cambell Pwky right by Murphy Park. King Jack Park in Webb City is a great place to walk dogs as well, as is the walking trail loop at the YMCA in Carthage if you can find a home you like near either of those.

Unless you specifically want to be in Joplin and closer to the majority of the areas amenities I'd suggested opening your search to Carl Junction, Webb City and Carthage as well. That will give you some more options. Carthage is a neat little town with a lot of historic homes.

"I am an Investor/Agent/Resident of Joplin! 

There are houses in every price range in Joplin, Webb City, Carl Junction. If you like walks and want to be nearby a few places, I would recommend near Mercy Park or the south side of town near freeman. That will get you close to Shoal Creek where there is roughly 4 miles of trails and paths. 

Generally anything south of 22nd st is newer. As someone stated before, near the high-school is a good area.

"I live in the College Skyline neighborhood that is to the north of MSSU and it’s lovely— safe and quiet and houses in your price range. The only recurring issue is some folks in the neighborhood absolutely refuse to do anything to stop their dogs wandering free! But that’s pretty minor :)

If anything is for sale in the neighborhood immediately north and east of Murphy Boulevard Park, check it out. 

Some other nice neighborhoods include the far south below 32nd street, and some subdivisions off Zora in the north. 

Honestly, there are other nice areas with sub-250k homes, too, here and there throughout town. But what you’ll find is that in Joplin, the character of a neighborhood can change very dramatically from block to block.

Robert Talbot east of Carthage is a larger area with a few trails and some views of Spring River. There is also Walter Woods south of Joplin. And a prairie area, I forget where it is exactly but it's kind of near GW Carver NM. There is  a conservation area with trails just east of Neosho as well. Missouri has LOTS of these smaller public spaces, you won't find much across the border in OK or KS. Shemerhorn that someone mentioned is an exception, worth a visit for sure.

Do be mindful of hunting seasons when exploring these areas. I have confirmed with MDC that these areas are open for ALL types of uses including hiking even during hunting seasons but some hunters are VERY unfriendly if they perceive you as disturbing ""their"" hunt. I've had a few unpleasant run-ins with guys in camo who were upset I was hiking a trail when (according to them) I shouldn't be out there hiking because it was hunting season. 

If you expand your radius to more like an hour and a half you can get into the Mark Twain Forest near Cassville which has some nice off the beaten path places. Roaring River State Park as someone mentioned is nice but it us often (relatively) crowded. Stockton State Park also has some longer trails that are decent and receive pretty light traffic.",t2_c3u54du,sullivan80,0,1647440796.0,0,t1_i0vzge3,i0vzge3,True,LeftHandofG-d,t3_tezk2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/joplinmo/comments/tezk2a/what_are_some_lesser_known_trails_or_places_with/,What are some lesser known trails or places with lots of wildlife?,/r/joplinmo/comments/tezk2a/what_are_some_lesser_known_trails_or_places_with/i0vzge3/,3,r/joplinmo,0,3

"You will be straddling a pretty nice area and a very rough area. So it's hit and miss. Generally speaking it's safe but I would definitely install cameras and security because the areas to the immediate south are very sketchy and downtown hosts a lot of vagrants.

What you've got is a decent heighborhood with some beautiful homes but it's proximity, being walking distance to seedy areas is the main problem so you need to be more aware of your surroundings a bit more than some other comparable areas. 

In my opinion there are two pretty bad parts of Joplin - one is the neighborhoods bordering broadway east of downtown, although broadway itself is seeing some rejuvenation. The other is the area roughly between 4th and 20th and immediately west of Main. But these areas aren't bad in the same way that Prospect is bad in Kansas City or anything like East St Louis. Not even North Springfield bad. Bad is a relative term. There was a tragic shooting a few days ago and it took place in a pretty nice part of Joplin. 

Joplin overall isn't any better or worse than anywhere else. If you are in a rough crowd trouble is going to find you. If you generally avoid trouble and use common sense regarding where you go and what you do you're generally going to be just fine.",t2_c3u54du,sullivan80,0,1647296079.0,0,t1_i0o9wco,i0o9wco,True,Gloomy-Bobcat-7551,t3_td6m8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/joplinmo/comments/td6m8q/moving_to_the_area/,Moving to the area.,/r/joplinmo/comments/td6m8q/moving_to_the_area/i0o9wco/,4,r/joplinmo,0,4
"Just a guess but I think the city WANTS to tear it down and has for a long time but recognizes there is some significant opposition from some groups they are sensitive to - particularly the older veteran community. So they dangle an astronomical cost proposal with a deliberately vague and cloudy vision of the plan.... so when it inevitably gets rejected they can say it was ""you the people"" who rejected Memorial Hall preservation not us the city council.

I am all about preserving history but in my opinion just because something is old doesn't necessarily make it special. Memorial Hall is not noteworthy. It's not an attractive building.

"We live in Murphysburg for reference. North Heights is, sadly, just a largely poor neighborhood. A lot of homeless people hangout downtown, and a lot of crackheads roam through the alleys at night digging through trash and walking through yards trying to find anything useful. As a woman, I feel unsafe walking at night, but in the mornings there are enough people out and about going to work that I wouldn't be uncomfortable exercising anywhere downtown. 2nd and 4th street are consistently busy throughout the day. Most people will leave you alone either way.

Don't get me wrong, I love our neighborhood and the houses are beautiful, and most people are pretty nice and keep to themselves.. but there is an extremely high property crime rate here, especially downtown. Make sure you don't leave anything valuable outside (people often have the dumbest things stolen: grills, garden hoses, mail/packages especially, whatever they can find) and install some cameras. My brand new car was stolen last year from our carport that has cameras aimed straight at it, and they unfortunately never caught the person who did it. Just be mindful of your things. I have never really been worried for my bodily safety, just that of my personal belongings.

Others can also vouch for this, but there is also an active arsonist in the neighborhood. Since last July there have been at least a dozen houses burned down in North Heights/Murphysburg. It may be considerably more, but those are the ones that I can recall. The feds are investigating it still but they haven't caught them yet. The local police department made a post about it over the winter, but I honestly don't think that they have any idea who it is and they haven't mentioned it since then. So that is also something to be mindful of: make sure your smoke detectors work. It sucks to have to be so paranoid about so many things, but that is our reality here. We decided to buy a house across town because we've had so many issues with property crime, but some are luckier than others.

But if you go out in pairs or all of you you'd be OK I'd think. You'll find what streets work and what don't around there - it's not all sketchy.

The only other danger I can think of is tripping on the bad sidewalks. And I mean they are *bad* in some streets - so watch your step!

"Doesn't sound far off.  Shooter was Anthony R Felix.  He was arrested by JPD in January 2021 on multiple charges including possession of drug paraphernalia.   Missouri Casenet also lists Mr. Felix as homeless.

Sounds like it all starts for this 40 year-old in January 2021.   Thing is.  This initial interaction is supposed to fix the issue.   Like broken windows is used to prevent criminals from growing bolder and committing worse crimes.  More like pulling over a speeder, and finding a shipment of drugs, or some other more serious violation.  

JPD got this guy to court.  But he made a deal apparently and plead guilty on the 3 counts.  Judge fined him less than $500 plus court costs.  

In the defense of the court.  They do this alllll the time.  Mr. Felix was a first time offender,  and probably insolvent financially, considering he's homeless.  Interactions like this are supposed to prevent further deviant behavior.   I guess this time it bit us in the ass.

"We're watching our home being built right now, and after a positive word-of-mouth pointed us towards this builder, I'm not impressed. Excessive amounts of nails and fasteners, as if having twice the amount necessary would make up for all the ones punching thru the sides of studs and framing, or just flat out missing entirely. Gaps, gaps, gaps everywhere... 2 bys in walls, end caps, and roofing not meeting cause they're cut too short. Large plywood gaps on ridges and valleys that'll probably be covered over by underlayment. Patchwork pieces of Zip sheathing that aren't even nailed flat, or appear to have the nails driven in too far. What's the depth anyway for those nails before its properties as a vapor barrier are affected?

It's no wonder they throw 'em up so quick. Quality is clearly lacking and it's quite the turn off from an organization that boasts about its reputation and Christian affiliation. Not sure raising a stink in the middle of this process will accomplish much.

"Okay, so this isn't exactly for the stars, but you can prob see them when the moment is right.

 I don't know how well-known this is, either (it wasn't that well-known 5 years ago when I learned about it). There's a little rock that overlooks the interstate by Mercy hospital. It's super beautiful at night with all the traffic passing by underneath, but I'm sure stars are regularly visible too. 

The easiest directions to get there are to get on 44th at Rangeline headed toward Mercy and don't stop until you're at a dead end (alternatively, you can go to Mercy on Main, go straight at the second roundabout, then turn left on Indiana, then a second left at the end of the road). 

There are some woods on your right and, if you go down into them, you'll find the little overlook area. 

It's not overly sketchy, but you may want to go during the day your first time, just to ease nerves and to know exactly where it is.

Alternatively, there's a park in Baxter Springs that's probably good for the stars. It's on 12th Street, as you're leaving Baxter to come toward Joplin.

"Lol, your initial depreciation show a clear and distinct lack of critical thinking and reading comprehension. I give zero fucks about Trump or Biden, they are the same guy. Neither side cares about you, you are a convenient tool used to help divide the populace. You drink the kool-aid and cannot comprehend that there is more than two sides. 

Now, the convoy has been going on for, what, a week? The air quality issue has been going on for far longer than that. Any halfway intelligent layman can figure out that means the convoy is **not** responsible for the air quality. Now, the one thing that you said that actually shows a cognizance of the world is the air generally (not always) moves more or less west to east in this region. So any bad air created by a temporary source will not stick around this area, you need a stationary and continuous source of pollution to create a situation involving bad air quality. 

Lastly, a plan is not a report, it's a plan. Reports contain data, not plans. This particular plan is from 2014, it seems and the link is defunct as well.

"I appreciate the outsiders perspective; thanks for taking the time to post!

It is a weird thing for me because in Joplin, I find myself to be more liberal than most people, but if I go to a liberal city, I find myself to be more conservative. I just want to live in a normal fucking city where people are just nice regardless of who you are or what your beliefs are but that seems damn near impossible these days. I need to live somewhere where there is some levelheadedness cause I've had enough of the radical behavior on both sides. Just happens that I'm at my tipping point with Joplin. I truly despise this town for soooooooo many reason many listed in my original post but that is just the tip of the iceberg. 

You are correct, though, there are many good things that Joplin has to offer and I also agree on the restaurants as an indictor as communities accepting other ethnicities. This town just has so much to learn and I have dedicated so much time with small results. As I have said before, even though Joplin says they want change they are so resistant and so things stay the same. It is like pulling teeth to raise taxes for important needs like the citys infrastructure and schools. Where I am originally from, citizens are willing to increase taxes because people want to see their shit fixed and improvements made. I think people from Joplin are only taught to hate the word ""tax"" and don't understand how important they are. It all goes back to the individualist mindset.

"I am sorry about that.  Due to health concerns, I moved here for my kids to know my relatives from Bay Area California.  The cheaper housing helped financially but it was a culture shock. So I am going to offer some assistance.

1) For people, try hanging out at the more liberal areas which based on your note, I assume you are more liberal than the average Joplin citizen.  Joplin Bookhouse Cinema and the Coda Concert House.  There are people left of center and there are even some right of center who have cooler heads.

2. If your spouse insists in staying in the area, try Carl Junction or Webb City, different water sources.

3.  Can't help with that,I was stunned when I saw the twin lightning bolts of the SS on two separate trucks.  All I can say, there are nazis and Confederate flags everywhere.  First year, I bought a house in the San Francisco bay area, we saw tattooed swastikas at a wine festival.  Joplin may have the confederate flag, but in West Virginia they want to make it illegal to tear down confederate monuments in a state that was founded since it wanted to stay in the Union.  Portland, Oregon has routine Proud Boy riots who sole purpose is to bankrupt the city.  In Ottawa, truck horns are blaring and people are being assaulted when they wear a mask.  Do not think moving will solve this issue.  Despite the low percentage of African Americans in town, there were supporters of the BLM.  This area does trend to view the Confederacy as people who fought for states rights,  but so does every state in the South.  

4.  Unfortunately, Covid is now political and this is Trump country.  Even Trump is booed when he mentions the vaccine.  Before the election, Kamala Harris questioned the vaccine.  As a country, we tend to honor wealth and political issues more than science.  No suggestions about city council except attend and do your best.  Maybe bring people from the neighborhood. It is obvious from the response to the masks, that the city council listened about removing mask rules.  Maybe 20-30 adults mentioning zoning issues will get them to listen.

5.  Go to the area where the tornado struck, there are houses built by different builders.  Also try Briarbrook and areas by Twin Hills.

6.  It is going to be expensive, there is Thomas Jefferson. For religious people there is College Heights and McCauley.  Carl Junction and Webb City used to test better and I know they love it when ever they out do Thomas Jefferson.  I would say that Joplin High seems to have more school organizations such as United Nations Club, Comic Book Club, Young Demos and Repubs, allowing kids to dive into their interests more.

7.  I have no idea what you are talking about for the dog food,probably since I have not been in the path of the wind currents.  North of 4th street seems to be OK and south of 20th is also OK.

I know that Joplin is not the best place in the world but it is not the worst place either.  Restaurants are an indication when a place is starting to welcome other ethnicities and viewpoints.  We now have two Indian restaurants, Thai and even Pho (Webb City).  They are bringing in schools for medicine and dentistry so hopefully some increase in financial diversity.  There is growth in population .  We have manufacturing plants: General Mills, Ajinomoto (love the potstickers) , Dog Food (sorry), Tamko, Leggett and Platt.  There is a lot of small theater groups and yes even bands playing in a house (sorry, like the Coda Concert House a lot).  A university is also good for the town, otherwise Springfield would not have been so angry.  On the other hand, better planning is required and the mall may soon be an empty shell if we cannot lure major chains back, but this is a national issue.  Drug issues are also a major issue for this area, but that is not unique to Joplin. The lack of affordable rental properties is a major issue, but that has affected me personally so I am biased.",t2_d5ff5m7h,tilted_dog7691,0,1644284227.0,0,t1_hw0vz0h,hw0vz0h,True,PartyFalse,t3_smicut,https://www.reddit.com/r/joplinmo/comments/smicut/joplin_sucks/,Joplin SUCKS!!!,/r/joplinmo/comments/smicut/joplin_sucks/hw0vz0h/,13,r/joplinmo,0,13

"I love Joplin. Here’s just a few of the reasons why:  
1. There are wonderful, active communities for racial justice, feminism, LGBTQ+ folks and kind neighbors willing to help each other out.  
2. The wages are pretty good for the cost of living.   
3. The seasons are real, but not incapacitating, allowing us to enjoy their fleeting beauty.  
4. Oak and hickory forests, beautiful prairies and creeks galore.  
5. We have a cool little downtown with some wonderful coffee shops, art displays and community theater. 

Do we have room for improvement? Yes, yes - a lot of room, but this is great community and we will keep getting better if we all keep trying.

"Dude I hate to say it but everything about your post is incredibly whiny and hysterical. You say you live your life ""terrified"" (your own word) about sinkholes, yet when asked to substantiate this fear, you say it's ""just a matter of time."" I could come up with a list of a hundred things that are more likely to kill or hurt you than a sinkhole. I won't do it because you'd probably have a nervous breakdown if you're already this worried about sinkholes. And you say you're concerned about lead poisoning, too? Dude, if I was afraid of being poisoned by any particular city, I simply wouldn't live there. I wouldn't continue to live there and then complain about being poisoned. I'd move. It's hard to take your opinion on the ""research and science"" of masking seriously when you already admit to being ""terrified"" of sinkholes and living somewhere that you're afraid is poisoning you. Not sure how to reconcile your actions with your words. If someone had said, ""I moved away from there years ago after learning how much the city was poisoning me,"" I'd take their opinion pretty seriously. If someone says, ""I'm being poisoned yet continuing to live here"" I don't know whether they're lying or need therapy.

I'm friendly with lots of types of people around here, including the Confederate flag crowd, and they sure sound a lot more tolerant than you are. I honestly have no idea what you find intolerant about them. Have you talked to them; made friends with any of them? Doesn't sound like it.

"In the 10 years I've lived here, I've come to realize that people in Joplin simply doesn't want change. Any new changes proposed, namely with bringing in new businesses or building new buildings, people throws a shit fit. People seem to love slapping the ""historic"" label on any and every old run down, piece of shit building just because it's old and then when people brings up demolishing them, people throws a shit fit. So they don't want old, run down shitty buildings torn down, but they also don't want anything new. It amazes me that by large, the people of Joplin would just rather live in a ghetto looking town with run down buildings. Joplin is the smaller version of Detroit.

3- I agree that the Confederate flag is the flag of the side who lost, and that flying it in 2022 looks silly. That said, it doesn't upset me. People fly lots of flags and advertise lots of things that I either disagree with or don't support. Part of maturity is learning to tolerate living alongside people you don't agree with. 

4- The only thing the local government got wrong on COVID were the worthless mask mandates that did nothing. Thankfully, they eventually let that expire. As far as planning goes, I don't disagree with you.

"I've actually been trying since I have been here but Joplin is highly resistant to change. Take Toby Teeter for example. He was one good thing that Joplin had going for it. He had invested millions of dollars of his own money into making Joplin a better place by being an ""Angel Investor"" in many projects before becoming the Joplin Chamber of Commerce's CEO. Once he became the CEO, he was mocked and ridiculed for calling Joplin ""racist"" which he never actually came out and did, he only implied it and he was correct. He said that Joplin needs to become a more diverse place for Joplin to become a more attractive for youths to stay and settle down in. 

Teeter also said that we need to move away from relying solely on manufacturing jobs and begin to transition to more tech jobs since this is the future. He was hoping to give incentives to young tech entrepreneurs who would more their business to Joplin. You know what happened, though? Joplin ran him out and now he is in Bentonville.

"We have been in our SM less than a year. Problems: It took 6 months to get a new cabinet door, since the originally installed on was not stained properly. There was a 3 inch gap between the trim around the door and the floor. They told be repeatedly that it would be too much work, but I kept complaining and finally they fixed it. It took about 5 months for them to fix issues with the flooring even after I explained that I couldn't walk barefoot in the master because my foot had been ripped open. They still have not offered to fix the floor in the main open living/kitchen area, and tell me that will be too much work as well. It is extremely wavey and you can see it from across the room...so wavey that if I stand barefoot it presses into the high arch on my foot.

With the most recent forecasts, this is rapidly turning into a multiple bread loaf situation.  During extreme winter weather preparations in the 4 State area area, it’s important you stick to the following method:  
\-Panic  
\-Encourage others around you to also panic by uploading pics of crowded grocery store lines  
\-Buy every gallon of milk you can find.  Is two gallons enough for 2 days of snow?  Doubt it, buy 6.   
\-Do not make eye contract with anyone in the bread aisle.  This is a surefire way to incite unnecessary stampedes.   
\-Check road reports constantly by asking on community pages how the roads are.  It’s snowing but are they snow covered?  We don’t know until we ask, again.   
\-For every .5 inches of precipitation forecasted, you’ll need one loaf of bread and one dozen eggs.  For example, 12 inches of snow forecasted X 2 equals 24 dozen eggs and 24 bread loaves.   
\-Become an immediate social media expert on city snow removal tactics, school superintendent decisions & meteorological forecasts.  Who knows better than you?  Not a single person who actually does these things for a living.    
\-Drive your front wheel drive Camry up steep hills during the event and take pictures to tell everyone how they should stay off the roads because it’s dangerous, because of you.    
\-Wear fun thermal socks and post pics of them in front of your fire with hashtag #SnowDay❄️",t2_ptr7d,Chat-_-rat,0,1643748883.0,0,t1_hv6m3ds,hv6m3ds,True,ThiccWurm,t3_si10n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/joplinmo/comments/si10n9/2022_jomo_sleetmagedon_thread/,2022 JoMo SLEETMAGEDON thread.,/r/joplinmo/comments/si10n9/2022_jomo_sleetmagedon_thread/hv6m3ds/,19,r/joplinmo,0,19

"It’s a monopoly in the sense that they bought the other theaters and tore them down.  We used to have other theaters here in town.  The 2 different ones in the mall closed when Northstar was built.  They bought Eastgate and closed it down.  They bought the Cinema 6 over where Sears used to be, turned it into the 2nd run theater and then closed it due to the problem it had from poor upkeep.  They basically in the end were competing with themselves cause they owned all the theaters in town.

And it’ll stay a monopoly until someone else comes in and builds another theater.  Until then, Northstar will continue to be run down because there’s no incentive to remodel.

Closest we have to competition for Northstar is the theater in Webb City, the one in Neosho, and the drive in in Carthage.  And none of those are a big enough threat to their business.

Pizza - Gusanos

Burgers - Tropicana, Blackstone, Famos Grill (Carterville)

Mexican - Habaneros (Carthage) - The place in Webb City across from Flag City is very good as well but the atmosphere sucks if that's important to a person.

Italian - Taste of Italy (Carthage) wins this by a mile. Wise Guys is good too though if you are wanting take out.

I built a cheap spec house in the mid 90s for $58k. Very shoddy construction and had calls at the time from other owners who went with the same contractor wanting me to join them in a lawsuit… but I knew it was cheap and it basically “worked” for me. Still live in it 26 years later and it’s still standing and most everything still works… but that’s just about it. I’ll never put serious money into it since it would cost a fortune… so will just go “as is” if I ever dump it.

"As a transplant foundation worker to the Midwest, I say it is absolutely astounding the shit you can get away with around here. I would think in tornado alley holdown straps brackets and bolts, embedded into piers would be a no brainer, but I guess insurance is abundant or something. Continuous footings? Nah, your basement-garage connection and interior-exterior walls joints can sink to hell if you're willing to live in it. The structural steel works better when it can drink water from the ground, of course... /s

The elevation issues around Mt. Hope are interesting and revealing. It takes a real lack of foresight to have 4ft of elevation change between foundations with a 10 ft setback, and this is only compounded by the slab on grade foundations in the area. I really hope these aren't being framed as plywood boxes as I have seen elsewhere; supply chain inflation seems to be cropping up some interesting framing ideas.

But water would be my main concern for any lot in this area. Where it goes and how much sediment it is taking.

They do everything as dirt cheap as possible and there's seriously no way everything they do is up to code. Plus they actively cover up any bad reviews or complaints. Coincidentally, their houses seem to magically begin to fall apart after their warranties expire.

SM is currently building in my parents' neighborhood,  and my parents have had nothing but trouble and negative experiences with the entire crew. They've caused property damage, trespass and park on my parents' property, block their driveway, sometimes block the entire road, don't clean up their trash, violate noise ordinances, and they recently left a brush fire burning overnight during a high wind warning.... and many other things. There's literally just too much shit they've done to remember and list out.

My FIL specifically blames them for putting him and many others out of business by severely undercutting everyone's prices. There's a reason nobody else will give such low bids- because a bid that low means cut corners and code violations that SM somehow gets away with.

"I built with SM, moved in spring of 2021.  I would bet money the CJ neighborhood you mention is where I am, over by Briarbrook. 

They're a cheap spec home builder and I got about what you would expect for around $100 a square foot.  One of my neighbors has had major plumbing issues from day 1.  I've seen 4 driveways dug out and replaced in the last 6 months for cracking issues.

I've built new before with Pulte in Las Vegas at a much higher price point and I had more fit/finish and quality issues on that home than this one.  The other big spec builders out there like Lennar and American West were no better.  Lawsuits flying everywhere.

One other thing, the base price of my Schuber floor plan has gone up $50-70k (depending on the neighborhood) since I purchased in 2020.

"One thing I've always felt like Joplin was missing is a great outdoor public space where people can just hang out and walk around. Some cities have a river front or a pier. Or some grand central park downtown (heck Carthage has that). Springfield developed some really cool downtown park areas along Jordan Creek back in the 00s. Joplin just doesn't really have anything and never has to my knowledge. The falls is cool but it's too much of a haven for cigarette smokers and meth heads. I wish the city would give that natural attraction the attention and protection it deserves. 

I've heard of far fetched proposals to re-route main street and turn 2nd -> 7th street into a community area with trees and whatnot. Sounds kind of intriguing but no way the public or the business owners would ever get on board with such a radical idea. They lost their minds over the proposal to reduce lanes and reconfigure parking even on a trial basis. 

I've also heard of a proposal to dam up that creek by the old depot and make a lake and a park down in that valley.

"Several of my friends and family members have owned one and none (like zero) of them were happy with the home or the company in general. More than one described the homes as garbage and the owners as snakes. I was talking to a friend the other day who was looking to move and complaining he couldn't find anything except shuber mitchell homes. The homes come with a bit of stigma in my opinion and I don't think they will age well but that remains to be seen. I believe a lot of the people who buy them are new to the area and don't realize a lot of locals avoid those homes like the plague.

But some people must be happy with them as many as they sell, right? And they have overwhelmingly positive reviews online last I knew, which makes NO sense to me because they have such a bad reputation in all my social circles. 

In my opinion they are ruining the home market. They are becoming the only option and building a monoculture of very large neighborhoods that all look exactly the same with that catalogy look you can spot from a mile away. I heard the other day they have over 1,000 home sites currently in development between Oronogo, Duenweg and Carthage. Carl Junction tried to block a shuber mitchell development because residents there were afraid it would devalue the area vs having homes build by literally any other builder.

They use their dominance in the local market to leverage below market rates for various trades - or they just in-source those trades and put the independent guys out of business as well. Which helps drive down their price and put other home builders out of business.

To their credit, their well packaged marketing building and financing plan makes it incredibly easy to build and pay for a new (semi) custom starter and sometimes mid range homes.

"Came here to say this. I keep thinking eventually I'll go to Regal/Northstar and not get pissed off but it just gets worse and worse. Now they have closed the ticket booth. Went there the other day and it took 20 minutes to wait in the concession line just to get tickets which are considerably higher in price than other nearby theaters.

Once in the theater, someone had left all the bright fluorescent room lights on - finally someone got up and found an employee to turn them off after the movie started. 

And the new(ish) trend of blasting patrons with loud commercials for 40 minutes before the show actually starts really sucks. I miss the days of listening to music and looking at a curtain or even the slideshow ads weren't bad. But since the switch to digital projectors it's become super obnoxious to arrive even a little bit early.

Not to mention the seats are squeaky and beyond worn. It's like Regal is just riding their monopoly horse until it dies, putting absolutely zero into the facility and experience knowing that many people will still go there instead of driving to Pburg or Neosho. 

I keep hearing of plans for a movie theater down by Sams Club but doubt it will happen, not in these times of covid and streaming home theaters.

"Those of us who remember know without question it was Stout's. 

Cave Gang (in Carthage) has been my favorite in the area for the last several years until it recently closed, apparently the owners wanted to focus on their gun shop and couldn't find a suitable new owner for the pizza place.

Palace Pizza was good but I am pretty sure it's closed also.

Today I'm not so sure. I like Gusanos but it's a chain, albeit a small one. I used to think Old Chicago was really good but it's also a chain and the last time I went there I got a pizza I swore they must have outsourced from Pizza Hut so I doubt I'll ever go back.

"most electricians have been pretty swamped these last few months. i would recommend Corky's electric, Fox electric and Mike's. if you have some incredibly high dollar fans that need special care then go with A-plus.

if you are installing industrial fans in a warehouse then CDL or A-plus is the way to go.",t2_6c8x2,ArletApple,0,1640565763.0,0,t1_hq371vc,hq371vc,True,[deleted],t3_rp9qje,https://www.reddit.com/r/joplinmo/comments/rp9qje/electricianhandyman_recommendations/,Electrician/Handyman Recommendations,/r/joplinmo/comments/rp9qje/electricianhandyman_recommendations/hq371vc/,2,r/joplinmo,0,2

"I used to go to Executive Spa and Massage and get massages from a man named Darren? I can't remember exactly, but I think he was the only male masseuse there. I thought he was amazing. 

I have a love/hate relationship with massages. I love them but it hurts me a little at the time and then I'm sore for a couple days and feel like I've been in a car wreck. 

I want to try Relax Magic sometime.",t2_ykftd,kasbahjes,0,1640350886.0,0,t1_hpsybbv,hpsybbv,True,[deleted],t3_rnfgba,https://www.reddit.com/r/joplinmo/comments/rnfgba/question/,Question,/r/joplinmo/comments/rnfgba/question/hpsybbv/,2,r/joplinmo,0,2
