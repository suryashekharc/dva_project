Highly unlikely. This story is relatable for me. I've pulled out onto a highway before and immediately been tailgated by a police car that wasn't there when I pulled out (they were doing over double the speed limit without their emergency lights or sirens as well).

">	Three months before the wreck that killed Luna, Klingmann received a verbal reprimand for failing to put his cruiser in park at a gas station, causing it to roll into a gas pump and damage property.

>	“The vehicle rolled across the parking lot and struck a gas pump at 3818 Sutherland Ave. (Shell gas station),” the reprimand form said. “The pumps were damaged, but there was no visible damage to Officer Klingmann’s vehicle.”

"KPD Officer Cody Klingmann was driving more than 80 mph and driving without his emergency equipment on about 3 a.m. August 13 when he collided with Luna. Klingmann was among several officers responding to a commercial burglary call.

Luna was sitting at a stop sign at Cheshire Drive by Olive Garden on Kingston Pike.

A THP investigation found that Luna pulled onto Kingston Pike after the lead officer responding to the burglary call passed by in front of him. 

Kingston Pike makes a slight rise just prior to its t-intersection with Cheshire Drive, a review by the Knox County District Attorney General's Office noted.

Speeding east on Kingston Pike, Klingmann struck Luna's Honda on the driver's side. Luna died at the scene.

""According to data obtained from the (officer's) Dodge, Klingmann was travelling 90 miles per hour .6 seconds before the crash, slowing to 81 miles per hour immediately prior to impact,"" the DA's Office review noted.

The DA's review determined criminal charges weren't merited; it didn't opine about potential civil liability.

Macias's lawsuit alleges the officer failed to use proper care while driving, was speeding and should have been using his emergency equipment.

Macias also names the city of Knoxville as a defendant in the lawsuit.

""The negligence of both defendants was the cause of the collision,"" the lawsuit states.

At 3 a.m. that day there was little traffic on Kingston Pike. The posted speed limit is 45 mph.",t2_12xlyq,Colin_Bowell,0,1648287367.0,0,t1_i26b4j2,i26b4j2,True,Colin_Bowell,t3_tol0ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/tol0ko/lawsuit_seeks_3m_against_city_kpd_officer_in/,"Lawsuit seeks $3M against city, KPD officer in fatal August crash",/r/Knoxville/comments/tol0ko/lawsuit_seeks_3m_against_city_kpd_officer_in/i26b4j2/,3,r/Knoxville,0,3

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

I would highly recommend learning more about these things rather than parroting the same talking points republicans in TN are - that delta8 and others are chemical laced street drugs.

I have used THC as a medicine for years now, and I can say from experience delta8 and other cannabinoids are incredibly beneficial when used correctly and bought from good sources.

Regardless your downplaying of the number doesn't matter because if even 1 person exists who is born and does not fit your strict definitions, then your definitions do not work. You're the one who said we should define gender by chromosomes and genitalia at birth.

And it really doesn't matter because my main point is that in reality you're not asking these questions of everyone you meet. You're going by social cues and what those people tell you. You've just decided in some cases it's ok to be bigoted and ignore what they tell you.

I don't know a single person for whom I could tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt what their chromosomes are and the number is not much higher for whom I'm positive of what their genitalia was at birth.

"Except it's not that simple, you're just oversimplifying things you (wrongly) assume you understand and calling it common sense. 

How many people do you know where you also *know* what their chromosomes are? Genitalia at birth? 

For reference, depending on the study between .02% and 2% of the population are born intersex. Approximately 1 in 80,000 people have Swyer Syndrome, which is a condition in which they are born with female external genitalia but XY chromosomes. 1 in 2000 to 1 in 2500 female children are born with Turner Syndrome, which means they have on X chromosome and the other is missing or incomplete. Approximately 1 in 650 male children are born with Klinefelter syndrome, which is a condition that involves having one or more extra X chromosomes (XXY). And the list goes on.

The craziest part is that many of these syndromes are not diagnosed until puberty or adulthood, sometimes they are not diagnosed at all. So you very well may know people whose chromosomes do not match their genitalia at birth and not know it. They might not even know it themselves.

Do you ask people about their chromosomes and genitals at birth regularly? 

Or do you just go with social cues like everyone else does?

"There’s plenty of issues that Tennessee needs to get up to speed on. Can we just be done with this? Let’s get the real thing. Admittedly, I’ve only read a few pieces of literature on Delta-8.

Why can’t we just have a couple nice things in this state/this country? I’ll accept the “well, if you don’t like it, gtfo.” That’s fine, USA and Tennessee are very middle of the road when it comes to best lifestyles on earth.

"Hi guys,

We've gotten OVERWHELMING SUPPORT from the various Tennessee subreddits in working to try and defeat William Lamberth's HB-1927 that seeks to outlaw Delta-8 THC and other alternate cannabinoids in TN.

If you haven't seen my original posts about contacting state representatives about this bill, please visit my profile and you'll see posts from me in the Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and Murfreesboro subs.

I spoke with the **Tennessee Growers Coalition** who are lobbying to defeat this bill that is getting voted on next **Wednesday, March 30.**

The Tennessee Growers Coalition in the process of hiring an ADDITIONAL lobbying team to directly defeat this bill. They told me that if we donate to the link above, it will go directly to defeat this bill.

I wanted to raise awareness about this in case you can help with a donation. We can donate and we can use my original posts mentioned above to contact those voting on this bill. This is how we can help!

Thank you Tennessee.",t2_hx7o5wwr,IknowIamBreathingIn,0,1648226684.0,0,t1_i232f9g,i232f9g,True,IknowIamBreathingIn,t3_tnq9ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/tnq9ab/new_way_you_can_help_defeat_upcoming_tn_delta8/,New Way You Can Help Defeat Upcoming TN Delta-8 THC Ban Bill,/r/Knoxville/comments/tnq9ab/new_way_you_can_help_defeat_upcoming_tn_delta8/i232f9g/,4,r/Knoxville,0,4

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"> yet she can’t even define what a female is

As she clearly explained, that is not her job as a judge and if a case comes to the court in which the definition of ""woman"" is a part of the arguments made, as seems likely given all the trans-exclusionary legislation being passed, then she needs to be able to objectively evaluate those arguments in conjunction with the law. Agreeing to define woman at this hearing, which would be in no way relevant to her judicial qualifications, would only give conservatives a reason to argue she should recuse herself from any cases that involve gender definition. 

Conservative judicial appointments do the same thing when asked questions about Roe and other cases where we *know* they have an opinion on but don't want to go on record so they won't have to recuse themselves.

"Knoxville School for Disc Golf. His name is Brandon Harrill and he's phenomenal at teaching. That being said, he's had some back issues and I'm not sure he's currently teaching. $35/hr last I checked. 

Grant Howard is doing free intro classes at the city parks (specifically VA and Morningside) that are group events. I'm not sure your skill level, but it's a great way to learn. 

There are currently at least two weekly doubles matches, Mondays at Admiral Farragut and Wednesday rotating between Tommy Schumpert and Morningside. They're $5 usually and are random A/B draw, so if you're a B player, you would be paired with an A player and it's a good way to learn. 

YouTube is also a great resource. I highly recommend videos from Scott Stokely. 

We have a very active competitive scene here in Knoxville, and the most active resource would be the Knoxville Disc Golf Players Page on Facebook. You can also talk to Brian at Pluto Sports and he can provide you with a wealth of information.

"I was pretty happy at Marble Alley.  I just chose a shit time and moved there in Feb 2020, and everything that would have made living downtown fun closed 3 weeks later.

The only reason I moved out of there is I needed 2 parking spots *and* didn't like paying the extra cost for being downtown when downtown was closed.

The only issued I had with the APT was a leaking p-trap under the kitchen sink, and they came and fixed it the same day.

You get 1 spot in the private parking garage, which is a huge plus among downtown places.

The daily(weekday) garbage pickup from leaving the provided trash can just outside your door is also nice.

It's also a pretty new building.  I think the floors are concrete(with walls stick built) so you don't hear upstairs neighbors or really adjacent ones either.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Technically you gave definitions for male and female, but never-mind that.

So you have this strict system depending on both chromosomes and reproductive organs at birth, nice and simple, right? So at birth everyone has to be tested, to ensure their chromosomes are accurately recorded, right? And then we'll need some way to enforce that in social situations, so maybe some kind of mandatory chromosome ID everyone is issued at birth, right? Because otherwise we don't really *know* if someone has the appropriate chromosomes for their gender presentation, right? And I guess we'd also need the mandatory ID to include some kind of sworn proof that their genitals at birth matched their chromosomes too, right?

I mean that's a little intrusive, what with the whole mandatory IDs thing, but we need to know so it's a small price to pay really. And then once we have mandatory chromosome screenings and ID cards issued at birth, we'll know for sure whether someone is definitively a man or a woman at all times, and if you ever get confused you can just say papers please! and they'll cough up that mandatory ID they've had since birth and everything will be clear.

Oh, but... what about intersex people? People with chromosomal anomalies so they don't have those chromosomes or they have a y chromosome but are born with female reproductive organs. What do we put on their mandatory ID then??

"I hear you. Knoxville isn’t perfect. But there are many things to find and love here, if you looks for them. In part, it’s about finding what makes you feel good in general and then finding that within this area. I’m relatively new here and love the hiking trails here personally. They make me deliriously happy in the spring, summer and early fall lol. There’s some really great food (including some great food trucks) if that’s your thing, and I’ve heard the music scene is pretty good too! There are some great libraries if reading or media is your thing, and those vary from branch to branch.

And of course, finding community and connection might also help you create a much better impression of the city. What do you like to do? I joined an adult martial arts class, for fun, when I moved here and made some great friends, plus it was as honestly a blast. Or there are churches /spiritual centers, painting classes, some good continuing education options.

Joy and happiness and connection to your city are things that can be CREATED, even if they didn’t automatically fall into place when you moved here. It’s been a crazy couple of years, so blame it on Covid and find what will make you happy!

"Ah, just saw this whole exchange. 

I think I perhaps caused this with my inexact word choice. My apologies to you both because the exchange between the two of you was caused because you both wanted to help me! Which was kind of you both.

And yes, just to be as helpful to everyone as possible— sadly, sometimes people feel so strongly that they are “right” and that there’s only one way that my open minded belief system IS offensive or uncomfortable for some Christians (and probably some agnostics too). I think that sometimes, those people who are uncomfortable or offended simply don’t know much about Buddhism and think it refers to something that it isn’t (or at least, not at the level that I am studying and practicing). And that’s ok! If my belief system makes someone uncomfortable, it’s not where I belong, and I’m looking to avoid places like that.

For what it’s worth: I’ve also attended very conservative Christian churches that welcomed me open arms for a long time. I was true to myself, they were true to themselves, and everyone talked beliefs together. For my side, I learned a lot of helpful tools there. Did I sometimes feel judged or like they wanted to convince me? Yeah, sure. That’s how we all feel in many places in life. But also: I was there to learn and grow. I wanted them to explain their viewpoint. I was there to be convinced. 

For me, it’s less about an afterlife and more about how to live right now, every day. I want to understand life and how to live without just going around on autopilot, doing whatever impulse comes next. I want to be in a church or community that helps me remember my values, that sort of re-focuses me and helps me stay on the right path in life.

Anyway, thank you to both of you for adding to this discussion. The idea that maybe a traditionally Christian church wouldn’t want me there was helpful and true!",t2_8982vxm1,Sufficient_Island_57,0,1648171333.0,0,t1_i20c7sm,i20c7sm,False,Sufficient_Island_57,t3_tm45ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/tm45ww/unusual_church_recs_looking_for_something_that/,(Unusual) Church recs?

"Sorry to hear you’ve experienced that! Medical billing is incredibly frustrating sometimes.

Have you ever navigated unexpectedly high medical bills? If yes, this advice likely will seem condescending which isn’t my intent. I had never negotiated medical billing until the last 6 months when I had nearly 50k in unexpected medical bills. It’s unfortunately a learned skill :-/

Here’s what I did:
1) reach out to the medical office first. Explain that you expected it to be covered (and why) and then find out why they are billing you so much. Confirm that they had the correct insurance policy and group numbers and that they actually received a response from insurance. Ask what the insurance company’s response was when they submitted and how they recommend that you proceed. Sometimes these two questions alone solve it. Sometimes my medical bills were not properly submitted. As part of this call, explain that you want to fight the bill and ask for an extension. The goal is to ensure that they don’t turn you over to a 3rd party, which typically buys your bill for a discount (YOU want ALL of the future discounting)
2) if the above doesn’t work, ask about resubmitting to insurance. Sometimes my doctors ended up submitting up to three times.
3) call insurance and get more detailed info after the above. In my case, I was able to figure out how the doctor could resubmit and code it differently and get full payment for one of my many bills
4) look into whether or not your insurance is required to pay for it in full (in this case, because it’s related to Covid). In my case, some of the bill had to be paid by insurance due to some specific laws.
4) If the doctor’s office didn’t warn you of this cost, why not? Did they submit it to the correct lab for your insurance? That seems like a threshold at which they should have been talking to you. In my previous city there were lots of places that had rapid test results within 24 hours guaranteed, for a few of around $150, and they explained it EVERY time. 

I found that being polite and taking meticulous notes helped.

I’m not sure if this amount makes it worthwhile to work all these angles, but hopefully my hard earned knowledge of medical billing navigation can help someone.

Hope you had a great trip!",t2_8982vxm1,Sufficient_Island_57,0,1648169345.0,0,t1_i207sc9,i207sc9,True,k310,t3_tn7105,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/tn7105/received_large_bill_for_a_covid_test_for_kid_what/,"Received large bill for a COVID test for kid, what do?",/r/Knoxville/comments/tn7105/received_large_bill_for_a_covid_test_for_kid_what/i207sc9/,13,r/Knoxville,0,13

"She's a big part of why the opioid crisis got as bad as it did.  A choice quote (from one of the below articles):

>Together, the drug industry spent $106 million over two years lobbying Congress in support of favorable legislation, including the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. After the bill passed, Rep. Blackburn collected a $120,000 campaign contribution from the pharmaceutical industry.

The law in question basically hamstrung the DEA when it came to slowing down drug shipments to corrupt providers.  There are also quite a few DEA agents that have come forward to talk about how she knew exactly what was going to happen because she was warned before the bill was passed.

Here's a random selection of articles on her involvement.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"There are three federally recognized tribes of Cherokee. Two, including the Nation are in Oklahoma, and the Eastern Band is in Cherokee. Each sets their own requirements for membership. My lineage traces back to the Dawes Roll and the Cherokee Nation, therefore I belong to them.

I'm not certain I meet that because I don't know much about my biological father's side of the family and my maternal grandmother was Irish. I do know that there's lineage on both sides, but my family took the easiest path to prove eligibility, so I don't have a full picture of my native history.

"This is a helpful comment. “Offend” might be a strong word, but my experience is that some people have different opinions than me, and I never want to cause harm. I don’t think that Christ or the sacrament is the *only* path.

Do I think that I “fit” in all churches? No. But do I think it’s okay for me to attend, that I am capable of taking it in and using what can support my path? Yes. And I think that I can do that without causing issue for those around me. I would think that attending a church and having a spiritual practice of some sort, even if not a perfect fit, is a step in the right direction.

I would definitely like a perfect fit though! Which is why I am here asking.

"Hm. Do you think a Lutheran church fits? 

Maybe you’re pointing at the answer: maybe I’m looking for a spiritual center and not a church.

My beliefs about Christ might offend people, so I will keep quiet. But I think that there are a lot of paths that support us in living well, thinking about our values and acting within them, and I think that many schools of thought would be supportive of that goal and the goal of connecting with God/spirit/higher-power or other words used by other places. 

This makes me sound more … something … than I really am. But it’s as close as I can come to expressing what I mean.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Good points.  I actually work in this market so the topic interests me quite a bit.  Oak Ridge is a weird town....the ""modest"" homes are largely the old Cemesto houses.  As you're probably aware, many of those have fallen into disrepair since the 1970s.  The Woodland area is a good example--it was originally a working-class/middle-class neighborhood, but it has fallen into nearly all low-income housing.  When they built the new Kroger, they literally had to raze an entire (old) neighborhood (including at least one church).  That was sad, because the houses they tore down were actually in fairly good condition.  Years earlier, they tore down a bunch of brownstone apartments in order to put in a Food City.  That's what it's come to in Oak Ridge--there's no more room for development and the city approves the destruction of homes to make way for business.  

As to people wanting larger houses and acreage, that's true.  But there's also a *massive* apartment shortage in Oak Ridge.  As of right now, there are only 2 A-level apartment communities in the city--Bristol Park and Centennial Village (which is actually far outside the city proper).  They're about to open a new complex on the site of the old Museum of Science & Energy (which they razed).  Rolling Hills (which is the largest apartment complex) is full and has a waitlist until the fall.  The same is true of the next largest complex, The Manhattan Apartments.  There are no available apartments currently in Oak Ridge AFAIK (and I'm pretty well informed in this area).  And with the labs and the constant influx of post-doctoral students *requiring housing,* it's created cascading problems.  The ""rush hour"" traffic into & out of OR is horrendous because there is effectively only 2 ways into Knoxville--Pellissippi Parkway or over a 2-lane bridge through Claxton (and down Clinton Hwy). Pushing all those grad students & post-docs over to Knox County has helped erode the tax base in Oak Ridge even more which has led to a decline in the schools, etc.  When I was growing up in Oak Ridge, it had more PhD's per capita than anywhere *on Earth.*  Now it's got a lot of meth-heads and fast food restaurants.",t2_4jj5b,zerozed,0,1648078786.0,0,t1_i1v4xp3,i1v4xp3,False,saveryquinn,t3_tkxc7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/tkxc7g/city_eyeing_a_fix_for_papermill/,City eyeing a fix for Papermill,/r/Knoxville/comments/tkxc7g/city_eyeing_a_fix_for_papermill/i1v4xp3/,4,r/Knoxville,0,4

"I agree. No need for a traffic light at McKays. 
People manage the in's and out's there seemingly friendly. A light would gridlock that stretch of road much more.  People turning out from McKays need not make a left. Go right! Its just simple to take a right out of McKays onto Papermill then take another right at whatever that street is where the Waffle House is located.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Yeah, there was never an incarceration rate anywhere near as high as that in the US today, so I’m not defending any of it but let’s have a little bit of perspective. And I mean I guess I just really empathize with the people who didn’t want the Nazis to overtake Europe and genocide millions of people. I mean hell, US media was still praising Hitler’s “accomplishments” in the late ‘30s; the global capitalist class would never have gotten involved until their own interests were threatened. Of course they had an agenda to spread the Soviet sphere of influence. They wanted to spread communism because they saw the measurable effects of socialist policies and the massive accomplishments they’d made as a society within such a short time.

What you’re saying now is biased, but not completely incorrect.

Now it has turned into a full blown create your own story and if they don't like a certain outcome they simply go back to a previous page and try again. Then a small group decides to go a slightly different direction and the next thing you know they're all trying to go a completely different direction and blame everyone except themselves when they realize that they're worse off than they previously were. I've tried explaining to my brother who's a conspiracy theorist. That if there is a ""deep state conspiracy"", that they're more likely to use the CT crowd to their advantage to create misinformation and utilize mind control, than any crazy complex fluoridation or other chemical/electronic mind control system.

Hi Fellow Tennesseeans,

I'm posting this link to raise awareness about Representative William Lamberth's new amendment to Bill HB-1927 that will effectively outlaw Delta-8 THC and other legal cannabinoids derived from legal hemp. Please remember, this bill is attempting to criminalize Delta-8 THC and other cannabinoids that are legal under both State and Federal Law.

This bill will:

Decrease State Revenue – Net Impact - $4,840,900/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

Increase State Expenditures - $2,900 Incarceration

Decrease Local Revenue – Net Impact - $1,975,400/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

This is a very poorly thought out bill that will negatively impact sales revenue in the state, will increase incarceration and expenses thereof and will decrease local tax revenue. This will hurt many local businesses and hemp farmers operating legally under state and federal law and will result in more Tennesseans getting incarcerated and becoming felons in possession of a FEDERALLY LEGAL compound.

Please my fellow Tennesseans, do what you can to raise awareness about this and help stop this bill in it's tracks. Representative Chris Hurt is pushing through Bill HB-1690 that seeks to regulate Delta-8 THC and create sales tax revenue in the state. This is a better approach and I hope that the bill to regulate vs outlaw takes precedent this year.

Both of these bills are going through the process now, so please do what you can to contact local reps, local businesses who legally sell Delta-8 THC and anybody who benefits from this legal medicine to try their best and fight back.

Much love Tennessee.

"Does it really matter who broke the pact? I get that you're coming at this from a specific lens and all but like they made a secret agreement to divide territories that did not currently belong to them and then annexed and invaded the territories that they had secretly agreed to take. That seems bad?

> because the annexed areas had a lot of ethnic minorities that Hitler wanted to kill, the Soviets decided to “invade” (there was little resistance; in general working people knew that their lives would be impacted more favorably by people who want to ensure their needs are met rather than those who want to literally murder them)

The Winter War was relatively little resistance? 

What they did in Poland was just to help the people?

>The Soviet government announced it was acting to protect the Ukrainians and Belarusians who lived in the eastern part of Poland, because the Polish state had collapsed – according to Soviet propaganda, which perfectly echoed Western sentiment that coined the term ""Blitzkrieg"" to describe Germany's ""lightning war"" crushing defeat of Poland after just weeks of battle – and could no longer guarantee the security of its own citizens. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded that the defense of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all uniformed troops to then-neutral Romania.

So they made a secret agreement to split Poland, then the Nazis invaded Poland, then the Soviets invaded Poland, then the Polish government caved, then they ended up splitting Poland as they had agreed to in their secret agreement?

Well at least they did it only to protect the Polish people and especially to protect the ethnic ~~Russians~~, wait no that's the current rationale for Russia invading Ukraine, sorry it was to protect the ~~Kurds~~, oops that was part of the US justification for invading Iraq, sorry, got it, it was to protect the ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians, right that was the line. 

Well at least everything went ok for the Polish people once they got Soviet citizenship... let me just make sure of that... and... 

>The Red Army, which vastly outnumbered the Polish defenders, achieved its targets encountering only limited resistance. Some 320,000 Polish prisoners of war had been captured. The campaign of mass persecution in the newly acquired areas began immediately. In November 1939 the Soviet government annexed the entire Polish territory under its control. Some 13.5 million Polish citizens who fell under the military occupation were made into new Soviet subjects following show elections conducted by the NKVD secret police in an atmosphere of terror, the results of which were used to legitimize the use of force. A Soviet campaign of political murders and other forms of repression, targeting Polish figures of authority such as military officers, police and priests, began with a wave of arrests and summary executions. The Soviet NKVD sent hundreds of thousands of people from eastern Poland to Siberia and other remote parts of the Soviet Union in four major waves of deportation between 1939 and 1941.

I knew she’d be disappointing when her entire “campaign” was “I like Trump so vote for me”. I couldn’t vote for her out of principle. And don’t get me wrong, I actually kind of liked Trump (for most of his policies, not his character or in a MAGA-worshipping sort of way). But if all you have to run on is that you support the president, you have no real platform. 

I don’t follow a lot of politics stuff on Twitter, but I follow her just because I like to see what the people representing me are saying, and my god, it’s just Tweet after Tweet of whatever the new Fox News hotness is. 

I was hoping that the Republicans would play nice during this SC hearing because let’s be honest, even if she does lean left ideologically she’s replacing someone who also leaned left ideologically plus the court is still going to be right-leaning overall. It’s the perfect time to just be the bigger people and make it a nice boring Supreme Court hearing and show the public that despite differences, lawmakers could work together.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

so the issue is that black men and women have been told there are limits and shown those limits, but they shouldn't believe in those limits, like you and other successful people?

okay well, that's honest and also a problem. do you understand why it's wrong to think racism doesn't help some and hurt others? are you willing to conceed that point or shall i explain with examples who racism helps?

> I think everyone should be treated equally.

okay so let's unpack this amazing egalitarian statement, because it's totally contrary to your position on CRT.

do you think our society, at any level you care to slice, is treating everyone equally?

imo, thinking that everyone should be treated equally is mutually exclusive with thinking that society is already completely equal. so do you think we are an egalitarian society or are their individual limits on that equality? do some people have more freedom than others? do some people have less?

because i'm here to tell you that if you think that our society can be more equal and that freedoms should be universal and granted equally to everyone regardless of race, color, sex, or creed, then you probably already believe in the relevance and message of CRT.

"> Their interests were actually diametrically opposed! Their ideologies elevate completely different, fundamentally antagonistic social classes and use different tactics to build support. 

Ok, fine? That's kind of what I meant by buddies was a stretch. Obviously there were ideological differences between the two, but they did sign a non aggression pact that included measures of cooperation and divided territories.

> At the signing, Ribbentrop and Stalin enjoyed warm conversations, exchanged toasts and further addressed the prior hostilities between the countries in the 1930s. They characterised Great Britain as always attempting to disrupt Soviet–German relations and stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact was aimed not at the Soviet Union but actually at Western democracies and ""frightened principally the City of London [British financiers] and the English shopkeepers.""

I'm not sure what exactly you mean by ""Their attempts were also demonstrated in protective measures taken to annex territories occupied by Soviets,"" but if you're saying that the Soviets occupied the territories named before the signing of the pact, you are wrong.

>Soon after the pact, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September... After the invasions, the new border between the two countries was confirmed by the supplementary protocol of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty. In March 1940, parts of the Karelia and Salla regions, in Finland, were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. That was followed by the Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region). Concern for ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been used as pretexts for the Soviets' invasion of Poland. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact since it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence that had been agreed with the Axis.",t2_azysy,AhabFlanders,0,1648056386.0,0,t1_i1tjq0g,i1tjq0g,False,KrautKuttar,t3_tkg7o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/tkg7o1/increase_in_wlm_propaganda/,Increase in WLM Propaganda,/r/Knoxville/comments/tkg7o1/increase_in_wlm_propaganda/i1tjq0g/,1,r/Knoxville,0,1

I am not going to pretend that there aren't bad aspects of our society that need to be addressed, especially ignorant ass racists but I disagree with CRTs methods of doing so. Teaching a little white kid that he/she oppresses other people merely by existing is nonsense. It's just as much nonsense as believing you are held back by some hypothetical social construct. It genuinely hurts my heart to think that a child of any race is told they cannot succeed because of the color of their skin. I'm just not on board with the victim mentality.

"Their interests were actually diametrically opposed! Their ideologies elevate completely different, fundamentally antagonistic social classes and use different tactics to build support. 

If you’re referring to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was not a formal alliance, it was well documented that the Soviets intended for it to avoid or delay war, and they expected other European countries to do the same. Their attempts were also demonstrated in protective measures taken to annex territories occupied by Soviets. It makes sense because they were all still recovering from the Great Depression. It was also known that much of Eastern Europe was going to be targeted by the Nazis due to the subhuman status of many of these ethnic groups to the Nazis and their belief that Jewish people were associated with communism, which they hated.

"Ok, since you are at least appearing to be civil.
My childhood wasn't the best but far from the worst. I was raped by my uncle repeatedly around 6 years old until my mom left my abusive biological father. I grew up eating red beans and rice most nights, as that was all my parents (step-dad) could afford working at a textile factory. Eventually through hard work on my parents' part, we were able to afford a nicer home and nicer food. Although my mom continued shopping at the salvage store (expired and damaged food). I attended a tiny ass podunk high-school in South Louisiana where my graduating class was 31 people, and we had very little extracurricular options to expose myself to various career options. When I say podunk, I mean shit hole. We didn't have A/C in every class, mold growing in various places, and it wasn't uncommon for ceiling tiles to fall on students. Not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, I enlisted in the military in hopes of finding some direction. After 11 years of service, I was medically retired after breaking my back and a botched shoulder surgery. I moved my wife and kids back to the States with no employment prospects from the UK where we were stationed at the time. I eventually got a job after nearly a year of searching at Second Harvest Food Bank and started college while working full time. Eventually, I was able to earn an MBA and have a decent job now.

hold up. do you really think white people haven't oppressed black people or anyone else for 200 years? that's crazy man. you can't ignore that redlining was an offical bank policy. desegregation was only 60 years ago. 

200 years, seriously? you are fucking loopy if you think racism ended with the civil war. there are countless, undeniable examples from the last 60 years. plenty in the last 20.
