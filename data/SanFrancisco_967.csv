"The voluntary slash is actually helpful for current employees - even those who joined recently - because it means new equity grants will be calculated at a fairer price, as opposed to the company continuing to sell itself at an inflated price.

My original point is that you claim a mostly federal program is under state control, or within the sole discretion of our state reps to do it. 

California could pass their own version of single payer within the state, and has declined to do so for 20+ years because they can’t figure out how to pay for it.

"Agreed. But unfortunately even that has limits.

We had large scale protests in support of black lives and only made minor progress on one of the most important social issues of our time. Protests can be effective but their success rate is actually pretty low. Usually, there's a deeper set of actions that drive the change and public protests are sort of along for the ride, following in the wake of less visible but more impactful action.

We need to get into the system and create change and unfortunately it means playing the political game and as one other person commented throwing money around.

To be clear, I think climate change is real and that we need to something about it yesterday, but there's gotta be a more cogent and thoughtful plan to play a game set up to keep us losing every time we try to fight the fossil fuel dynasty.

"Weird flex, but ok, here you go: “Nowhere is that truer than in California, where their proliferation has reached epidemic proportions, according to local and federal law enforcement officials in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco. Over the past 18 months, the officials said, ghost guns accounted for 25 to 50 percent of firearms recovered at crime scenes. The vast majority of suspects caught with them were legally prohibited from having guns.”  -NYTimes, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/14/us/ghost-guns-homemade-firearms.html

That quote tracks with what I have heard from law enforcement personally. (It is a bit higher in Southern California)

Straw purchases (the scheme you are describing) fell out of fashion when the cost of manufacturing reenforced polymers strong enough to mold handgun lowers became easy to work with in small scale batches.  Why would someone pay a crackhead $200 to walk into a gun store when you can produce the entire firearm for about that much? It’s also logistically difficult to do straw purchases in the same volume as you can do a manufacturing operation.

Decriminalization would vastly decrease the profit margins in gun importation and those same people will move on to counterfeit printer ink or whatever else makes them more money. Production volume goes down and you lose the economies of scale that make the parts readily available. People now have to go back to thefts and straw purchases which are much harder to do at scale.

Reminds me of my last apartment building. The greedy landlord turned the garage space into 2 more units to bring to a total of 14 units. I looked at the new units and inquired about the rent.

This was about a year before COVID-19 hit us, so around 2019. The tenants who rented the two units both left as soon as their leases ended.

OP was riding south.  Riding on the sidewalk there helps you avoid riding in traffic that you would have to face at every intersection on the west side of the street.  The bikeway is very short, there's not too much point in riding in it for two blocks or whatever.  It'll make more sense when they hopefully extend it.

"You started off by trying to argue that Houston area traffic design is superior as evidenced by shorter average commute time. I showed you how Houston area traffic design, and overall urban planning, is actually terrible, as evidenced by relatively long commute time.

Now you're moving goalposts and trying to turn this into a discussion about comfort and living space.

Yes, people will generally spend equal time in their own private auto than on mass transit. And people generally like having larger homes with more space. You might as well move goalposts even further and try to turn this into a discussion about state income taxes or gun rights or whatever you can summon up to change the conversation.

But Houston's commute time is proof of how sprawl, lack of density, poor urban planning, and lack of mass transit results in less efficient commuting for people.

So go ahead and try to move the goalposts if you want. But now you know that the support you used for your argument is a bad one. If you're too prideful to admit that, it's not a big deal to me. But there's no point to have a discussion with someone who just digs in their heels when confronted with reasonable points made that ought to be considered, and not just simply swept aside.

"> The actual City of Houston

This is meaningless, because nearby cities also contribute to traffic. It's just as meaningless as looking at Seattle or San Francisco on its own. So I specifically got the number for Houston and the immediate cities around it.

> So if you want to limit ""average commute"" to these two areas and populations, and NYC has an average commute time that is 25% longer, that makes Houston look like shit, because the NYC commute moves 380% the number of people in 50% of the space, with only a 25% time penalty.

So what? Why should I care about how many people NYC moves? So called ""urbanists"" are obsessed with density and the number of passengers.

The real obsession should be with the _comfort_ of people. 

> Now compare the Houston Metro Area with the NYC Metro area. You'll still see the empirical efficiency of density and mass transit.

Now compare the average living space for NYC citizens and Houston citizens. Go on, do it.

"> Houston area has 2.5 million population. It's a big area, so the commutes are actually pretty efficient.

What's the point of discussing or debating if facts cannot be respected?

The actual City of Houston has about 2.3 million residents inhabiting about 640 square miles.

The actual City of New York (the five boroughs) has a population of about 8.8 million residents inhabiting about 320 square miles.

So if you want to limit ""average commute"" to these two areas and populations, and NYC has an average commute time that is 25% longer, that makes Houston look like shit, because the NYC commute moves 380% the number of people in 50% of the space, with only a 25% time penalty.

Comparing the two cities and their average commutes literally proves the efficiency of density and transit and traffic planning that de-emphasizes private auto commuting and sprawl.

You've disproven your own argument.

Now compare the Houston Metro Area with the NYC Metro area. You'll still see the empirical efficiency of density and mass transit. 

You'll also see how lack of density in the city center or central city leads to sprawl.

">The takeaway is that Houston actually actually has relatively bad commute times considering its relatively low density.

Houston area has 2.5 million population. It's a big area, so the commutes are actually pretty efficient.

>Only if you want to pretend as if there isn't increase in population and exhaustion of roadway capacity over time.

So build more. Duh. And we will also have technologies in the near future that will improve the utilization of the existing capacity. Even fully automatic cruise control already improves the flow by about 20%, and self-driving can double the capacity.

>Which happens with increase in density as well as outward sprawl.

Nope. By avoiding the obsolete ""The Downtown"" urban model, the ""outward spiral"" doesn't result in growing congestion. Houston is a good example, because only a fraction of commutes begin and end in the downtown (which might as well not exist).

>Only if you want to disingenuously reduce something to an absurdity.

You're the one raising the nonsense ""transformative change"" argument.

> If you prohibit greater density (and zoning that decreases commuting) and force sprawl as a result, then movement becomes less efficient and commute time goes up.
> Just look at Houston versus NYC

Nope. Houston shows that you absolutely can keep the commute time in check by not forcing the workers to go to The Downtown every day. Instead the workplaces in Houston are distributed across the city, resulting in much healthier traffic flows.

This should be the aim of any actual planner who doesn't have a goal of packing as many ~~sardines into a tin can~~  people into high-rises as possible.

In cases where the urban morons already sabotaged the city beyond all hopes of help, the best way is to promote hub-and-spokes model with rapid transit (rail, maaaaaybe real BRT).

"> So basically, the takeaway is: do not build dense hellscape cities like NYC

The takeaway is that Houston actually actually has relatively bad commute times considering its relatively low density.

It illustrates how lower density sprawl that has designed in longer distance commuting via private auto makes for less efficient commuting.

> That's incorrect. As Katy Freeway shows, traffic gets BETTER although the freeway speed itself doesn't improve a lot.

Only if you want to pretend as if there isn't increase in population and exhaustion of roadway capacity over time. 

Which happens with increase in density as well as outward sprawl.

> Yup. That's why I'm against densification. Instead the region should build outwards.

I don't understand how you can argue that in this conversation. It's simply counter-intuitive by your own measure.

You cited average commute times showing NYC average commute being 26% longer than average Houston commute.

But the NYC Metro Area compared to the Houston Metro Area has easily 200% the population if comparing similar square mileage footprints.

So the density and mass transit of NYC allows 200%+ the amount of people to get to/from work in only 25% more time.

That's empirically more efficient.

> And why do we need ""transformative change""? To allow for more density to allow for better public transportation to allow for more density?

Only if you want to disingenuously reduce something to an absurdity.

Density is the best way to accommodate development with regard to commute and travel time.

If you prohibit greater density (and zoning that decreases commuting) and force sprawl as a result, then movement becomes less efficient and commute time goes up.

And development will occur either through increased density or wider sprawl.

Just look at Houston versus NYC.",t2_y275w,FuzzyOptics,0,1648244448.0,0,t1_i24ahqq,i24ahqq,False,tamaleringwald,t3_tnbyc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/tnbyc9/traveled_1_block_in_25_hrs_the_whole_time_maps/,"Traveled 1 block in 2.5 hrs, the whole time Maps has said 12 min delay lol",/r/sanfrancisco/comments/tnbyc9/traveled_1_block_in_25_hrs_the_whole_time_maps/i24ahqq/,1,r/sanfrancisco,0,1

"> Those differences look pretty good, considering that Houston has a fraction of the population density of New York, Seattle, and even San Francisco.

So basically, the takeaway is: do not build dense hellscape cities like NYC. Houston allows people to live in individual houses and have a shorter commute than in denser cities.

> Whatever we do to expand the carrying capacity of roadways for private automobiles just gets filled and, very quickly, traffic is worse than it was before the increase in capacity.

That's incorrect. As Katy Freeway shows, traffic gets BETTER although the freeway speed itself doesn't improve a lot.

> Ultimately, unless one wants and can effect a freeze on development and population growth in this area, increasing capacity for people to commute by private automobile leads to a dead end.

Yup. That's why I'm against densification. Instead the region should build outwards. There's plenty of land near Enumclaw, for example.

> Increasing capacity is just kicking the can down the curb and making it even more difficult to make the transformative change that's necessary to reduce the amount of life that is wasted on routine commuting.

">	A recent report found that San Francisco police stopped Black people at a rate of nearly 39 times per 1,000 residents in 2021. In comparison, data show SFPD stopped white people nearly seven times per 1,000 residents. San Francisco supervisors discussed the racial disparities at Tuesday’s board meeting.

>	“Bottom line, we have to address this disparity problem we have,” Scott said Thursday. “We can’t keep doing the same things and expect things to change.”

1) Do they realize that correlation doesn’t always equal causation? More blacks being stopped doesn’t mean they’re being stopped **because** they’re black. 

2) Do they realize that they can improve the stats by simply pulling over more white people instead of pulling over fewer black people?

"This seems reasonable. Mar opposed the recalls, showing that he's out-of-step with the electorate which supported them overwhelmingly.

Mar's support for making recalls harder is also pretty terrible. Keep in mind that recalls are already incredibly hard — normal working people with jobs need to organize themselves, spend thousands of hours volunteering, spend tens of thousands of dollars, and even when the recall is hugely popular like it was in this instance, it still takes a year or more to go through. This allowed Lopez and Collins to do plenty more damage on their way out, hurting kids, making San Francisco the laughing stock of the entire world, and just generally wasting everybody's time.

I'd contend that by far this city's biggest problem and root of all other problems is its politicians. You talk to most people who live here and they have pretty reasonable stances on most issues, but somehow a hugely disproportionate number of our supervisors and other elected positions are crazy people who reliably hold the most awful positions on almost everything. But they keep getting in anyway through a combination of name recognition and the fact that most voters don't research very deeply.

There are also a ton of other unethical things people may do. Most if not all contractors I know are paid under the table. They report working for like half a year, then go on unemployment / benefits for the other half (while still working and getting paid under the table). They cycle this time to report wages for however long until they can go on benefits again. Tax free + unemployment benefits puts them at a significantly higher compensation than you would expect. There's also a bunch of other benefits, full rides/extra cash for their kids for colleges, setup LLCs under their kids names for tax benefits, etc. etc.

"Ah, since humor isn’t quite to your taste as a relief mechanism in trying times, I’ll do my best to provide a real answer just for you instead. 

1. Consider purchasing a thief prevention technology, like the Cat Clamp. Similar solutions include a “cat cage” or a “welder”

2. Sell the vehicle, do not replace the cat and rely on public transit / bicycling. Do not own a modern vehicle with an expensive cat unless you have a secure personal garage

3. Purchase a classic car that does not require a cat or emissions testing

4. Move to a remote rural area with less crime

e: 5. DIY your own cat cage! The CatClamp (https://catclamp.com/) is just aircraft-grade wire rope routed through two split clamps, which attach before and after your catalytic converter (https://catclamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ccm175300.jpg). 

You then create up to 7 attachment points to your vehicle's frame, crossbars, etc. with the routing of the wire rope. This deters thieves because they have to cut through several attachment points instead of just two. But the CatClamp costs ~$400 plus labor to install. 

50 ft of 1/4 inch aircraft grade wire rope costs $18.99 per roll at Harbor Freight https://www.harborfreight.com/50-ft-x-14-in-aircraft-grade-wire-rope-61789.html

CatClamp appears to use 3/8 inch thick galvanized aircraft grade wire rope so to directly match that you could purchase the same thing here at $2.24/foot https://www.ziplinegear.com/products/gwr500?variant=14439987970093

*""The Patented CatClamp® design requires only a 3/8"" hole/opening for the wire rope to pass through and secure the CatClamp® to the vehicle chassis. This process is repeated until all cable is consumed, and each of the eight holes in both split clamps is used.""*

Now all you need to do is select two suitable split clamps and you've successfully embarked on your journey to prevent catalytic converter theft: https://www.google.com/search?q=split+clamp&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=shop&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj83ejTkeL2AhURKn0KHXgIBhYQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1562&bih=879&dpr=1",t2_z5jtph7,pentax-k-1000,1,1648234942.0,0,t1_i23ng4e,i23ng4e,False,foundmonster,t3_tnp3vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/tnp3vv/how_do_you_protect_your_car_from_being_robbed_of/,How do you protect your car from being robbed of its catalytic converter?,/r/sanfrancisco/comments/tnp3vv/how_do_you_protect_your_car_from_being_robbed_of/i23ng4e/,-2,r/sanfrancisco,0,-2

"> As far as I've read, in Huston, when they built out the highway  it reduced traffic

I really hate these kinds of publications. They are vapid and moronic.

Katy's Freeway expansion did not increase the _speed_ of traffic on the freeway, but it increased its throughput. So more cars per minute can pass it. This in turn reduced the congestion everywhere else in the city.

The results speak for themselves. None of the ""urbanist"" publications tells that Houston has one of the lowest commute times for the large metro areas in the US.

The average commute times:

Houston - 27 minutes

New York - 34 minutes

"What do you like?

The ocean / nature? Take the Hyde cable car up to Fisherman's Wharf and then walk West until you get to the bridge (or get tired). Then take the 28 to Golden Gate Park and go through there, maybe the botanical garden or conservatory of flowers.

Chinatown is also fun to explore the markets and restaurants there. You can go through the Dragon Gate and head North. Then catch the historic F train (giggity) that will go down Market to the Castro and explore that area too.

If you're a shopping fan you could check out the Westfield Mall, and I think they have a sort of selfie museum in there if you're so inclined. It's also right near the Metreon which is a great theater where you catch a huge IMAX film if you like movies. Ride the merry go round then bowl a few rounds. 

Just like to chill and people watch? Go to Dolores Park and just hang out. Smoke some weed or eat some edibles and vibe.

The super secret is out, and now we have the MoonSwatch in our lives. And what is that? Well it's basically an Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch, but Swatchified. Instead of a stainless-steel case the MoonSwatch is made from Swatch's BioCeramic, which comprises a mix of ⅔ ceramic and ⅓ bio-derived plastic using the seeds of a castor plant. Nobody really knows what that means, but it's provocative and it gets the people going.

"I'm interested in those case studies. Generally American city spending on roads and infrastructure is a single digit percentage of municipal budgets. Cities are generally under spending and not keeping up with replacing aging pipes and roads, but the question is by what percent do taxes need to increase to keep up? If it's 9% that's tough but doable. If it's 59% that's a massive problem. Also ""keep up"" means stop the situation from worsening, not getting all infrastructure back to good conditions.

Bedroom communities are going to be in different financial conditions than big cities with considerably more business revenue. Tracy compared to San Jose for example. 

Despite the anti-density sentiment in most suburbs, lots of those cities are upzoning near their commuter train station or downtown as much as they have downtowns. They can see the fiscal problem even if voters generally don't. That upzoning and new development will make some degree of difference to future budgets. 

It also matters how expensive homes are in those suburbs. Higher income earners will pay more taxes to replace aging utilities and keep them reliable.

"It says nothing about multiple tenants. Taking this further because I really am curious and would like to know, I found [this from the rent board:](https://sfrb.org/topic-no-019-partial-exemption-certain-single-family-homes-and-condominiums-under-costa-Hawkins)

>Pursuant to the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, as of January 1, 1999 single-family homes and condominiums are generally exempt from the rent increase limitations (but not the just cause eviction provisions) of the Rent Ordinance, but ONLY IF the tenancy commenced on or after January 1, 1996.

>Any tenancy in a single-family home or condominium that commenced before January 1, 1996 is still subject to the entire Ordinance. This includes continuing tenancies even where there is no original tenant remaining who was living in the unit prior to January 1, 1996.

>A single-family dwelling with a legal in-law unit constitutes a two-unit building and is not exempt from the Ordinance. A single-family dwelling with an illegal in-law unit also constitutes a two-unit building and is not exempt, unless both units are rented together as a single tenancy.

>A single-family dwelling is not exempt if there is another residential structure on the same lot.

>**A house occupied by an owner who rents out more than one room as separate rental units, in a situation akin to a boarding house, may not qualify for exemption as a single-family dwelling.**

>Effective January 1, 2002, certain condominium units that have not been sold by the subdividing owner, are not exempt from the Ordinance. For such units, the lawful rent in effect for the unit on May 7, 2001 is the initial base rent for the unit.

>The exemption for single-family homes and condominiums does not apply where there was an outstanding citation for a serious health, safety or building code violation that remained unabated for six months or longer preceding the last vacancy. The exemption is also not applicable if the prior tenancy was terminated by a notice to quit or based upon a change in the terms of the tenancy for which notice was given under Civil Code Section 827.

>Since units exempted from rent control limitations by Costa-Hawkins are still subject to the just cause eviction controls of the Ordinance, the annual Rent Board fee will continue to be collected for these units.

So basically you can qualify for rent control in a single family home if it's owner occupied and run like a boarding house.

"> The interesting point I gleaned however was simply the fact that she was in a position to be sued as a landlord almost 5 years ago.

Actually that's not much of a barrier. Even if you don't own property people can and do get sued as landlords because they sublet. Unless you're renting a bed, virtually any type of renting can be further sublet though doing so may be in violation of the lease and/or law.

>That'd mean she went from immigrating to the US and working as a janitor and farm laborer to owning property in America's steepest housing market within 7 years.

Maybe she did, but just because she got sued as a landlord doesn't mean she owned property. She for instance could have rented an apartment then parcelled it out by subletting to her coworkers.
