"I‚Äôve rented for 15 years with pits. I always just listed them as mixed breeds, and because they are the most LOVEABULL animals on the planet..no neighbor ever complained. But times are changing and they are such a popular breed, it‚Äôs not crazy to think that landlords are more open minded (especially with rental prices rn)..but you can always get a emotional support or CGC certification, which allows you to live anywhere and prevents them from questioning or charging you for them. I lived in Camden Bay for 2 years with two pitties, and because I paid pet rent, every time someone left üí© anywhere near my place they slapped a fine on my door. And despite paying a double deposit they still billed me $1000 for carpet when I moved out. Best bet is finding a property owner that isn‚Äôt a  corporate complex, I‚Äôve stayed at my south Tampa duplex for 9 years because it‚Äôs never been an issue. Pit bulls are never the problem, only people. I‚Äôve always felt guilty for lying because I love to show them off and prove people wrong. Good luck!

Why would a homeowner not want to maximize their solar usage to be as close to net zero as possible?

First off, I'd be shocked if this were the only component of my electric bill that was similarly not a direct benefit to all customers. But more importantly, why is this any different than say myself, as a homeowner, paying taxes for public schools when i don't have children? I'm happy to do so because it's a benefit to my community, and quite frankly for society to have an educated populace, much in the same way it's a benefit for us to have and promote cleaner energy .

">She also has an advantage without it.

Her testosterone levels now could be ""fixed,"" but that doesn't change the fact a decade plus of testosterone makes bones denser, muscles bigger and gives a massive advantage regardless of the sex at birth.

I think we need to separate the obvious advantage of testosterone during puberty for athletes from someone with body dysmorphic disorder or who is transgender.  We shouldn't disqualify her for what she is going though now, but what she went through in puberty with all that testosterone gave her an advantage that is simply not fair for the other athletes that didn't have testosterone during puberty.

It doesn't make her a bad person to be transgender, we should have no problem with that.  We should do what we can to make her feel accepted without hurting other people.  This is a clear case of harm in sports, but there wouldn't be in most other things.  You can't deny there is a serious performance advantage with testosterone fueled puberty and that is the disqualifier here, not her current hormone levels.

"I‚Äôm 37 ‚Äúwins‚Äù in traffic court since 2005 or so, either fighting my own tickets directly or going and helping friends and family do this exact same thing. If you didn‚Äôt commit the offense they wrote the ticket for, fight it with a not guilty but remember you‚Äôre going to need a lawyer or a lot of reading up on traffic laws.

If you know they got you - they got you. Radar speeding tickets, cop witnesses you run a stop sign? Time to plead it guilty. If the cop doesn‚Äôt show they almost always reschedule for another date so it really takes the cop not showing up twice. That said - most of the magistrates who run traffic court love giving breaks like no points or reduced fines when you just straight up plead guilty to it.

"""It's not political"" and then you list reasons that have become political. I can see where you think you aren't making it political by not specifying that. Hey, I hate hypocrites as well and if you are going to promote something, stick to it- but I myself have removed my mask at times to take pictures, and I have indeed held my breath too in some situaitons. That's neither here nor there. My kids did do school virtually until this school year and both still wear masks to school by choice, so it's not things I find oppressive. How the pandemic was handled by your state and how you feel about that is political for most people who had problems with mandates (thinking CA=bad, FL=good). Life in San Francisco and LA is way different than that in Tampa, way more populated, people taking public transit, way easier to spread a virus around. They did things they needed to do. 

As for the prosecution, it's untrue they are not doing what they would normally do in misdemeanor theft situations- same things they do here. They are however prosecuting ""rings"" (individuals stealing less than $950 individually but with coordinated plans to resell later) as felonies. Where's the outrage that you can steal up to $2.5k of stuff in Texas without it being a felony? It's just something political to raise arms over in CA. Literal quote, Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.), ‚ÄúWe removed the consequence for stealing ‚Äì and what do you know, it caused a lot more stealing. Under Prop 47, you can go into a store and steal up to $950 worth of merchandise and it‚Äôs not even charged as a felony."" Yeah, it's not a felony in a TON OF STATES. Purposely misleading. Governor has encouraged localities to stack individual thefts when prosecuting as well (so steal a few times and it's over $950? Felony).

Reality is Prop 47 didn't do anything to stop cops from arresting shoplifters nor prosecutors from pursuing charges. And bail is bail- people with money can afford it, others can't or use bail bondsmen- it's again not any legislation stopping anyone from faces consequences (innocent until proven guilty, that's our legal system- but we can detain someone who has not yet been found guilty of a crime simply because they don't have money, and that's a whole other depressing topic).

"How is this a one-sided argument?  The thing I always see from Republicans nowadays are attacks or indifference to women.

Refusal to renew the Violence Against Women Act

Undermining abortion rights.  

Criminalizing ending ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES.  Which have a 1 in 60 million fetal survival rate, and left medically untreated, an extremely high maternal mortality rate.

Defunding birth control from insurance companies

Supporting child marriage.

Flirting with the idea of decriminalizing domestic violence.

Deriding Me, Too movement.  Talking about ‚ÄúLegitimate Rape‚Äù.

Etc, etc, etc.

Always Republicans.  I can always count on them to be on the wrong side of every issue that‚Äôs important to womens‚Äô lives, health, and safety.

So it‚Äôs really quite difficult to take at face value that they‚Äôre doing this for women‚Äôs rights / well-being.

"You need to consider that even as Tampa may be expensive when measured against the national average, it is ludicrously cheap when you are coming from SF or NYC.

I have lived in NYC since 2006. It used to be a great city for the first eight or so years but then the cracks started forming. New Yorkers are aware that their city is expensive and many of them are willing to pay that premium but increasingly less so when it offers a quality of life that sometimes feels more reminiscent of Lagos, Nigeria.

Right now NYC is seeing a totally implausible jump in rents. A friend of mine just moved all of his stuff into storage and is temporarily hanging out in Spain because the landlord literally wanted to double the rent. My rent's okayish by NYC-standard but would pay for something a lot bigger and nicer most everywhere else.

It really doesn't matter that the real estate market has gone bonkers in your neck of the woods because a) ours is too and b) we have to live in a state that is for all intents and purposes bankrupt and the only solution that our mediocre breed of politicians can come up with is raising taxes further. I pay $30,000 in NY state income tax alone. And I get very little in return for it.

That's my perspective as someone living in one of those very expensive places and, for full disclosure, why I am lurking in a number of Floridian subreddits (but I am not limiting myself to Florida - it's just one option). I will be moving away here towards the end of the year but I don't yet know where.

It may well be Tampa and I know you folks hate the idea of us New Yorkers descending upon your cities like locusts and you certainly haven't deserved that. But what are we supposed to do? My city sucks, most of my social circle has eroded (or will) as my friends are moving away. We are not coming because we are all political extremists (as has been suggested in this thread elsewhere) or try to be assholes and ruin your days. 

We are looking at your cities because your state doesn't have income tax, real estate is still incomprehensibly cheap compared to what shit costs here and while you do have unpleasant summers, we have them as well.",t2_13ftv,parkerpyne,0,1648219992.0,0,t1_i22la0c,i22la0c,False,VTX1800F,t3_tmeiw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/tmeiw5/tampa_3rd_most_popular_city_to_move_to_in_us/,Tampa 3rd most popular city to move to in US,/r/tampa/comments/tmeiw5/tampa_3rd_most_popular_city_to_move_to_in_us/i22la0c/,1,r/tampa,0,1

"Alright, they are moving here because Florida and our politicians are amazing and help every resident of Florida to live their best life. Protecting FREEDOM! WOOO We're leading the way in quality of life, healthiest people in the country, most educated, best paid, least amount of crime, amazing infrastructure... better? /s

There are cheaper Republican wastelands than Florida, none of this explains why they would flock to the most liberal city in Florida. 

Start looking at some crime rankings for property theft, violent crime, etc. There's no march to the top of that list for liberal only cities at all. In fact, there's tons of very dangerous cities in conservative leaning states. Reality is violent crime is on the rise nationwide and CA isn't at the head of it. This often comes up, so let's look at the change in their policies regarding theft- now it's a misdemeanor (and no, it's not ""allowed"", you still face charges.) to steal $950 or less in CA, more- that is a felony (previously the cut off was even lower, closer to $500). Similar to Florida where its $750. In Texas, that's up to $2,500 as a misdemeanor.

"House insurance will adjust with whatever overly inflated prices the crooked landlords and people selling homes wants it to be worth. With demand going up, they know they can ask for more money and that's all they care about is making more money. I won't get into taxes much because that's already more of an illegal thing that's unconstitutional but everyone accepts it so it exists. When property value goes up though, you can bet the greedy ass government will want to steal more money via taxes.

I won't blame the government on this one because government isn't responsible for the increase in demand for homes. This is why it's always a bad idea for a city to see rapid growth. The biggest cities have the highest costs of living in most cases. There are some exceptions but generally more people creates the impression that a location is in higher demand and higher demand gives those owning the properties to charge more money to rent it or sell it.

Insurance companies have to go up if the home value goes up so that if the home were destroyed then the insurance would actually cover the value of the home. America has largely become a nation devoted to debt slavery. In the past 10 or more years, it's become far more common for people to remain at their parents homes many years longer than what would be considered normal due to increased housing costs and inflation.

It's become more common for people to take on roommates to avoid downsizing their way of life.

"Technically a male that transitions to a female and then dominates against females is cheating. They have a biologically physical advantage that is almost impossible for a biological female to overcome in sports. If there is a sport where there is 1st place, 2nd place, and so on and the winner was caught cheating then typically the 1st place ends up going to who was originally 2nd place.

This doesn't and shouldn't apply in this particular situation because the male that wanted to become a female was allowed to compete in the sport. DeSantis shouldn't be able to strip away the win but the transgender situation should be stopped regarding sports. It doesn't matter what the guy's feelings are in all of this either. He chose to transition into what society has deemed a female and that's his choice.

When he chose to transition into a female, he fully knew the endless backlash that would come with it. We don't see females transitioning into males then getting involved in sports because they know how pointless it would be. The fact of life is that the average male would still beat a top tier female athlete in most sports that were not largely dependent on skill and this is simply biology, it's not my opinion.",t2_q7l447a,southbeatz11,0,1648197406.0,0,t1_i21ixx4,i21ixx4,False,Sharkey-McStevenson,t3_tkqhok,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/tkqhok/gov_desantis_issues_proclamation_declaring/,Gov.

"Back in 1992 my parents moved to FL and the road they lived on at the time was still dirt. There was about a quarter mile tunnel of trees which looked pretty cool. At night the trees made the road very dark but as it seems to go, the once peaceful area had the road paved. The paved road wasn't a problem but it opened up an opportunity for lots of semi trucks to fly down the road with a 45mph speed limit going at least 70mph and destroying the road.

The county would come out and do a quick patch on the road that last a few months at a time. A road that once was in a peaceful area where you could walk down it was turned into a highway out in the county. I haven't been there in a few years but last time I was in that area I noticed nearly half of all the trees along one side of the road had been cut down for something.

I'm fine with people moving to FL because everyone should be able to choose where they want to live if they can afford it but way too many people move to FL. Since you were talking about Brandon, I moved from Tampa about a year ago so I used to live in Hillsborough county. One problem is population because Hillsborough is roughly around 1.5 million people while the entire state of West Virginia is 1.8 million for the entire state.

There's a lot of empty space around America so it would be nice if people stopped trying to flock to FL and over crowd this state. I'd hate for it to turn into an over populated shit hole like NY or CA. Sometimes people remind me of rats, they want to all flock to the biggest cities, biggest areas and leave hundreds upon hundreds of miles of empty land. If people that wanted a new city or even a new state would choose some of these states that are not so crowded then FL wouldn't be gradually losing its beauty.

People can say anything they want about the city but without nature and all those trees, we all die from lack of oxygen. Bigger cities far too often just look dumpy and dirty like a giant concrete jungle with no beauty. FL used to have a lot of wonderful nature to explore but gradually it's getting destroyed just so some millionaires can build and get richer while there's less of the outdoors for us actual residents to enjoy.

I know there are plenty of parks to go to but people should get their heads out of their asses. Not but but probably quite a bit of those flocking to places like FL are among those fake people that preach climate change but if we were to talk about that never ending lie then big cities contribute to that more than anything else. Many of the small businesses have been crushed by the Walmarts of the world as well.

Some people don't know what they're missing out on because it was destroyed before they were born or old enough to remember. Some people might choose to stay home and never enjoy the outdoors but that's no life to live and certainly not a healthy life. I'm currently in north FL but intend to move back to south FL but probably will skip Tampa this time for maybe Fort Myers.

I enjoy the ocean, boating, scuba diving, hiking many miles in parks and other places. That hasn't been destroyed entirely yet to be replaced by more useless buildings that will end up sitting empty when more businesses start than are needed. I've seen that a lot over the years, it seems especially bad with Dollar General having a store about every 5 miles literally.

I wish 30 years ago technology was like it is today, then I'd have plenty of videos and pictures but all I have is memories of what used to be. It is the way things go and nothing we can do about it but that doesn't mean myself or others have to like it. In many other countries it's pretty common for major cities to commonly have over 10 million people. One day America might suffer that same fate when people flock to the nearest bigger city.

At least the Tampa area isn't quite as bad as the Miami area yet with over population but things I've heard and read about lately makes it seem like Tampa is headed in that direction.",t2_q7l447a,southbeatz11,0,1648186452.0,0,t1_i215ebp,i215ebp,True,Concertcat24,t3_tnck14,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/tnck14/brandon_peeps/,Brandon peeps‚Ä¶,/r/tampa/comments/tnck14/brandon_peeps/i215ebp/,5,r/tampa,0,5

You‚Äôll be less than two miles from a key entrance to the toll road that can quickly get you into Tampa or beyond. That‚Äôs worth a lot since Brandon traffic can really suck.
