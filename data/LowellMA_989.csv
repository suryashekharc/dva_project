"This is amazing. Thank you! 

Great to hear from someone with a western MA perspective.

I was considering Waltham / Newton as well, but honestly, my ex lives there and I think it might freak her out üòÖ maybe that‚Äôs petty of me.

Personally I‚Äôve explored Waltham a good bit, and I just like the feel of Lowell better.

Something about the complexity of the downtown area, small streets, walkabikity etc that really works for me.

I work from home, and I just can‚Äôt be in my apartment all day.  To me, the city is an extension of my office, and I need to be able to move around, work at restaraunts, and feel good about the area.

Thanks again",t2_e4ad8c04,zuluana,0,1648276013.0,0,t1_i25y7i2,i25y7i2,False,zuluana,t3_tncxfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/tncxfd/thinking_of_moving_to_lowell/,Thinking of moving to Lowell,/r/LowellMA/comments/tncxfd/thinking_of_moving_to_lowell/i25y7i2/,1,r/LowellMA,0,1

"I‚Äôm from Amherst, MA currently in Lowell. Take your time finding a place I didn‚Äôt have that luxury as I‚Äôm in school. Lowell is pretty low key has more jobs in the general area then the pioneer valley but definitely a city which comes with city problems. Greenfield has its fair share of issues but it is peaceful which noise wise moving to Lowell I didn‚Äôt find that where I ended up sadly only in winters as there‚Äôs street racing near me. I do love the fact that location wise really nice between ocean and mountains near major city Boston and close to the NH border(tax free). Take your time scouting apartments it can seem like one thing and then it‚Äôs another, overall happy about the area for being in a city it‚Äôs a manageable adjustment.",t2_3xk0kqwh,Midnight_3,0,1648265613.0,0,t1_i25iked,i25iked,True,zuluana,t3_tncxfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/tncxfd/thinking_of_moving_to_lowell/,Thinking of moving to Lowell,/r/LowellMA/comments/tncxfd/thinking_of_moving_to_lowell/i25iked/,2,r/LowellMA,0,2
"I think you have a lot of good info here. I grew up in Chelmsford, went to UMass, lived in Northampton and now live and work in Brattleboro, VT so I am probably more familiar with where you're coming from in Greenfield than most other posters here. 

Compared to Greenfield there is a lot going on in Lowell.  There's quite a few bars and clubs. The Tsongas Arena brings in some decently large music acts to go along with NCAA D1 hockey and basketball games. We are hopeful the Spinners will come back and there will be minor league baseball in the city again. The Lowell Summer Music series hosts outdoor concerts most weekend over the summer and is really great. 

The tech/startup scene is smaller in Lowell than along 128 or in urban Boston, but again relative to Western Mass there is a substantial tech and bio med industry. Youre also only about fifteen minutes to half an hour to Burlington or Waltham, depending on traffic, which are both major hubs for start ups. 

There are many renovated mill buildings that have beautiful condos and apartments in the Downtown area and around the college. For a one bedroom you are looking in the range of $1,500 to 2k. Depending on your age you might also like to live in the sections of the city around the college where there is a large student population.The only area I would avoid is on Appleton and Summer streets. 

Crime in Lowell in all honestly is not very different from Greenfield, just on a larger scale. In any given year the violent crime rate in Greenfield is actually higher than in Lowell, and it is a much safer city than Springfield or Holyoke. 

The food scene in Lowell is so good. It's one of the best things about the city and really eclipses anything in Western Mass, even Northampton. Simply Khmer, Pho 88, The Athenian Corner, Panela and Romeu and Juliet are a few of my favorites but there are so so many more. You can find food from all corners of the world in Lowell. Espresso Pizza is the best pizza in the City and for grinders I recommend Santoros or Zesty. The Owl Diner is my #1 for breakfast.

Sorry for such a long message!

"I‚Äôve lived in Lowell‚Äôs Highland neighborhood for 13+ years. I‚Äôm older and lazy so I don‚Äôt go downtown much.

You have the Tsongas Center for concerts and sports, the Lowell Auditorium for concerts, and the Merrimack Repertory Theatre all within walking distance. Mill 5 has a movie theater, a coffee shop, and great little independent stores. The local bars have music and trivia nights. The Lowell Summer Music Series brings in great acts for outdoor shows June-Sept. The restaurant choices are varied and amazing, plus a quick drive or a Grubhub delivery can get you so much more.

"My partner and I moved here from a Boston suburb in August 2020, where there were limited dine-in options (if any? feels like a world away now) and a lot of closed spaces (museums, stores, etc.). We have loved every single day here.

We live downtown and have two pets, so our rent is a little higher than your budget. But I think you can find something for that price.

There's a new club/bar that opened up downtown called Thrive (edited to say it's actually called ""Trend."" I said I couldn't hang and I meant it.). That was really bustling last week or two with St. Patrick's Day celebrants. My dumb old bones could never hang, but there is a variety of spaces where you can be out and enjoy yourself, depending on what your particular speed is.

Lowell is a great place to be, I think, especially if you're excited about being in a diverse space that has its own character. (One of the things I tell people a lot since moving here is how great it is to be out of Boston's center of gravity. Sure, you can get down there easily, but Lowell has its own character and identity. You're not in greater Boston... you're in Lowell.)

I will complain about local politics - there's a lot of antiquated thinking and a bit of a ""good old boy"" network. But I get the sense that some of that's changing. Overall, I'm happy to be part of a community here.

"Lowell has some gritt that reminds me of Pittsburgh. You'll be safe walking around, but have street smarts. Everybody's comfort level is different. 

We do have tech, but its nothing like Boston. UMass Lowell has the Innovation Center, which includes a robotics center. Some of the mills like Wannalancit house companies too. For social, there is a Lowell techworkers meetup.

There's alot of range in downtown apartment complexs. I know people that live in Mass Mills complex for 1700 in a 2-bed. There are also 2000+ luxury mill apartments. That said, it may be more expensive now with inflation. You may want to search craigslist/FB/discord for other listings. If you want lower rent, expand your view to lower Belvidere, Centralville, or the Highlands.

I, honestly, feel like Lowell is far away from the beach. But, if you have a car, it could be a nice weekend trip. There's also some good outdoor activities in Lowell.

"No, definitely not. That's not to say Lowell never had its fair share of gang violence.

"Take for what it's worth below. Born and raised in Lowell, lived there for 30 years before moving out to Nashua. Lowell is a great city surrounded by 495 and Route 3, you can cross into NH and pay no tax or head to Boston for more entertainment and come back to a relatively quiet city. I wouldn't take advice from people who never lived here, as people that don't generally have negative views about Lowell. Not all the time but usually I'll hear someone in college or at work say that Lowell is a shithole.

 It has a rich environment, bunch of different ethnic foods from a lot of cultures, good schools in UML and Middlesex Community College. To answer your questions:

There's really not much of a nightlife. There are certainly bars in downtown but they are usually only open til midnight or a little after. Unless that much has changed in the 3-4 years I left...

With UML and MCC, there are some smaller tech startups but a lot of that is still in the Route 3/Burlington area. That's not to say there aren't any companies in Lowell. They're just more spread out. But I'm sure if you look close enough, you may find something. It's just not going to be a Somerville or some Boston-area type startup.

There are certainly apartments throughout the city; however, more new construction/apartments are being constructed in the downtown area. It's part of the larger change Lowell is going through. The newer apartments obviously tend to be more expensive but may be in your budget. It's also possible if you want to save some money, there are multi-family houses you can rent out as well. You don't necessarily have to budget for $2k. I lived at the Hadley Park Apartments for 10 years and paid ~$1100 a month.

I'll say this- Lowell is only dangerous if you hang out with the wrong crowds. There are a few murders per year but usually involve people who know each other or are gang-related. Lowell residents usually, usually mind their own business. Again, I think the location of Lowell is what makes it great. Nothing is ever too far to get to.

"I believe that Canal Place 3 used to be the wool washing mill for Bigelow carpets. 

My friend bought and lives in a 2 bed there. They did have to use electric plug-in heaters in mid January because the condo boilers needed to be repaired. Despite the new parking facility hiding the swamp locks, there's still a lot of natural light. The hallways are tight and winding. But no issues of noise. I haven't heard of any other issues. Perhaps you can request the condo building association's meeting minutes and budget? 

Some things to note:

* 246.1 Market contains the old turbine (?) building and coal pocket. The attached one to Canal Place 1 has plans to be turned into 23 apartments. No idea about the coal pocket, but it's a beautiful yet forbidden secret garden. 
* Cute lil garden alley between Canal Place 1 and 2

"You've got a lot of good suggestions here. Doing my best not to repeat places that are already mentioned.

I'd add Espresso Pizza Downtown Lowell for my favorite pizza in the area. A little bit out of the way but Pini's Pizza in Billerica is great.

Zesty Pizza in Chelmsford has great subs, best in the area imo. Pizza is pretty decent Greek New England Style. Santoro's in Lowell is the classic spot to get an Italian sub or a Steak and Cheese. Original owners sold it and it went downhill, but its been sold again and the new owners brought back a lot of the old staff and its back to being pretty close to as good as it was. Also really like Eliu's Hole in the Wall in Lowell for Pizza/Subs.

Big fan of Pita, greek fast casual in the large plaza in Chelmsford center.

Owl Diner in Lowell. Summer Street Diner in Chelmsford is also good, Rosie's in North Chelmsford and Belly Buster in Billerica. I'd avoid Rosco's Diner in Chelmsford Center.

Top Donut in Lowell is great for take out breakfast food. Basically a better Dunkin Donuts.

Yummy Express and The Saigon Sandwich Shop, both in Lowell for Banh Mi and other Asian takeout.

Romeo and Juliet in Lowell for awesome Brazilian takeout.

Four Seasons in Lowell for Portuguese. The Olympia and the Athenian Corner for Greek Food. Olympos Bakery in Lowell is another great spot for sandwiches and greek baked goods. 

Other restaurants: Mama's in Dracut for Italian, Good Thymes in Lowell for standard American food. Tequilas in North Chelmsford for Mexican food. Pho 88 in Drum Hill for Vietnamese Noodle Soup. Fishbones in Chelmsford Center for Seafood.

Other stuff in the area: The Butterfly Place in Westford is an indoor greenhouse full of hundreds of species of butterflies really love that place. If you get a little further from the city there  are a lot of great hiking sports in Acton, Littleton, Carlisle and Concord. I'd especially recommend the Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in Concord, Nagog Hill in Acton, Nashoba Brook/Spring Hill/ Camp Acton in Acton and Great Brook in Carlisle.

There are a lot of bars in Downtown Lowell, but right in Chelmsford the main bars are the Brickhouse Pizza in the Center, the Hong Kong for a real dive bar, and the Princeton Station.",t2_4a02mcj,canadacorriendo785,0,1645768333.0,0,t1_hyciypn,hyciypn,True,dukeofender,t3_t0af82,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/t0af82/moving_into_town/,Moving into town,/r/LowellMA/comments/t0af82/moving_into_town/hyciypn/,2,r/LowellMA,0,2

Cafe 12 has great breakfast and great sandwiches.

Beadles is a cute shop where you can make your own jewelry.

"Food: 

* Panela (Colombian) 
* Simply Khmer
* China Star 
* Mill City BBQ
* Pho 88 
* Holly Crab
* Life Alive
* Sushi Yanagi 
* Madras Grill (Indian in Chelmsford) 
* The Keep (also has awesome craft drinks)

Food to avoid (from personal experience)
* El Jefe - drinks are good but tacos meh. 
* TreMonte - food is alright but making the trip to north end is more worth your time and $ 
* The Establishment - basic American food that doesn‚Äôt stand out 

Tea/Coffee:

* Brew‚Äôd Awakening
* Snowdaes (especially for bubble tea and desserts)

Natural areas:

* Lowell/tyngs/Dracut state forest
* Great brook farm in Carlisle right next to Chelmsford
* Minuteman national park in Lexington 
* Of course the boott cotton mill museum (will tell you a lot about Chelmsford and Lowell) 
* the riverwalk in Lowell 

Local events:

* Lowell summer music series, fun outdoor shows throughout the summer 
* Lowell folk fest!!! It‚Äôs been cancelled the past couple years due to Covid but hopefully this year things will be different

"Madras Grill on summer street in Chelmsford is great Indian food. For pizza I‚Äôm a fan of Venetos and Brick House, both in Vinal Square. 

For Chinese food I really like Feng Shui in Tyngsboro, it‚Äôs not too far from North Chelmsford. I haven‚Äôt tried China Mountain but I‚Äôve heard good things about them.

"For food, you got a ton of Asian options already from others-- Lowell is quite Asian-centric.  I'll try not to duplicate.   I'd add China Star for good Chinese with an incredibly diverse menu.  We also like Blue Taleh for Sushi as well as Sushi Yanagi in Drum Hill.    If it hasn't been mentioned yet (I've lost track!) A bizarre, delicious fusion of pasta and Asian exists at Sizzling Kitchen--  crazy, awesome  hot stone bowl dishes called Bipimbap among others.  The place rocks.  Egg roll Cafe on University and Tasty Dumplings on Market at Dummer are also great, quirky little places, though with much more limited menus.  

Asian aside, the Old Court (Irish pub & food) Gormley's Cafe (diner-- full Irish breakfast year round) the original Life Alive (Vegan) Holly Crab (Louisiana seafood boil) Mill City BBQ (BBQ, as noted, owned by one of the nicest people you'll ever meet) and there's GREAT pizza and beer selections at TreMonte pizzeria,--  all downtown -- and all are excellent. Traditional, well-performed  American/mixes are found at the aforementioned Warp & Weft downtown or at  the Establishment on Princeton in Chelmsford.  I don't love Fuse Bistro myself, but others do, so definitely give them a shot as well.  Lowell 's also historically Greek so you'll find Olympia and Athenian Corner in/Near downtown.   Always a battle to see whom likes which one better.  (Hint: they're both great.)  Olympia was trying to do live music for a time.  Don't know what's on the schedule at this point.   

2 places I haven't been yet are El Jefe on Cabot (mexican/street taco I believe) and a French place that opened just before the Pandemic (yikes!) on the corner of Market and Worthen streets.

"Rather a lot of live music, or rather there will be again when things get back on track.

And while I'm on the subject of the Mill No. 5, there's the Luna Theater (which should have the Luna Sessions jazz night coming back... sometime) which is currently open and showing movies Wednesday through Sundays.

Warp & Weft has live music on certain days. You can also sometimes find punk shows over at Thirsty First. The Worthen is also a spot that does live open mics.

In April you'll have [The Town & The City](https://www.thetownandthecityfestival.com/) Festival returning to town. Not to mention the [Lowell Folk Festival](https://lowellfolkfestival.org/) coming, in theory, in July.

"This was 10 years ago so they very well could have changed it since then but when I took it they take you out of the garage to the right and you stop at the stop sign on Middlesex street, then take a right out on Middlesex going towards what used to be the Lord overpass. 

Then we took a left on Elliot st. and the right onto Appleton. Took the next left at Haffners, and then we stopped to do the parallel parking part of it behind Haffners next to South Common. 

Just make sure you go slow and come to a full stop at all the stop signs. Good luck.

"In my book, the train wins hands down, no contest.  It's just so much better to be able to read or watch something or even just do a crossword or something, than it is to have to drive in traffic, where 100% of your time is wasted.  This changes if your commute is super early or late (so you have no traffic), or if your work hours are unpredictable (so you might miss your get-home train). But, for sure it's doable, and you should definitely try it to see if it works for you.

I can't tell from your post if you know this or not, but the train from Lowell goes to North Station, not South Station.  To get to South Station from there, you have these options:

1) Walk. It's about 1 mile, so that's about 20 minutes for me.

2) Take a ""blue bike"". You can pick one up at the dock at/near North Station, and return it to the dock at South Station, then do the reverse after work. https://www.bluebikes.com/

"Not sure where you are in Lowell, but from the time the Commuter Rail leaves Lowell, you can expect the commute to take an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.  I would much prefer this than driving in to Boston as it might be a little slower, but the commuter rail is far more enjoyable than driving in traffic. 

The train from Lowell to North Station takes about 45 minutes then you can walk to South Station in about 20-25 minutes.  

Or you can shave off a bit and use the T from North Station, but since there is no direct line from North Station to South Station, it is probably not worth it.

The best method is riding a bike through Boston, but during commuting hours you can't bring a bike on the Commuter Rail.

You can always Taxi or Uber, but that adds up quick, and morning traffic means you probably are better off walking anyways.",t2_awpjl,Skeeter_206,0,1642565490.0,0,t1_ht9xggh,ht9xggh,True,biography_biology,t3_s7gc2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/s7gc2v/commute_from_lowell_to_south_station/,Commute from Lowell to South Station,/r/LowellMA/comments/s7gc2v/commute_from_lowell_to_south_station/ht9xggh/,11,r/LowellMA,0,11

"I don't really care about the mask mandate, but how else would you boycott it?  If a city imposes a policy like this, boycotting that city means boycotting its businesses.  I agree that those businesses will suffer and have no direct control over the policies, but the idea with any boycott like this is that you generate enough pressure on those local businesses and within that local community that the politicians who DO have control over the policy are compelled to change the policy.  Of course you need enough support to make that happen, and that doesn't seem likely here, but the boycott as a concept still makes sense.  Imagine if Lowell did something outrageous, like impose racial segregation in public businesses there (I am not equating this with a mask mandate).  How would you boycott that policy if not by avoiding segregated businesses in Lowell?  You can still say those businesses have no control over the policy, which is true, but boycotting them would still be an effective way to put economic pressure on the city.  Of course, with such an outrageous policy, there would be much more support for a boycott which would generate much more pressure on the city.",t2_9pmke,SandyBouattick,0,1641788382.0,0,t1_hs0nowz,hs0nowz,False,agnad,t3_rzviuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/rzviuy/is_anyone_else_choosing_not_to_do_business_in/,Is anyone else choosing not to do business in Lowell during the mask mandate?,/r/LowellMA/comments/rzviuy/is_anyone_else_choosing_not_to_do_business_in/hs0nowz/,-12,r/LowellMA,0,-12

"The whole thing seems silly to me. There is close to zero enforcement, and many people seem unaware of the mandate.  Seen plenty of people in the last few days entering Lowell businesses with no masks and nobody in the businesses saying a thing.   

If go to any surrounding towns there are no such rules - which just adds to the confusion.  Do people not cross town lines???  DUMB!

Walked into a popular restaurant downtown Thursday night.  Walked in with mask, went 10 feet to my table.  Got a drink, mask off once my drink arrived.  95% of patrons had masks off - all of them sitting there well over and hour.  Door dash people who were coming and going the whole time - not a mask on any of them.

"Other local point of interest: The Francis Gate on Broadway Street, Lowell-Dracut-Tynsgboro State Forest in the Pawtucketville neighborhood, the Hell's Angels grave at West Lawn cemetery (Plain St. Once you're inside go to 2nd and D, four rows back and three stones in between two bushes). Kerouac is nearby at Edson Cemetery (technically on Gorham St, but you can get in from the back on Plain Street when you exit West Lawn). Once inside it's Lot 94 (Lincoln and 7th). Jack is middle of the lot, fake stone is the size of a backboard and has his in-laws. Real stone is twelve steps in front of the right edge and is just a flat marker for him and Stella).

For public art you'll find a few murals, old painted billboards, sculptures and statues. Also if you park at the far end of the Target lot on Plain Street (allll the way down) you'll find an abandoned rail bed that's recently been cleaned up to make way for a bike path. Follow that a couple of hundred yards and sometimes there's good aerosol art.

&#x200B;

If you have a car and want to check out some interesting green spaces try Mine Falls in Nashua, Benson's in Hudson, The Andre's Institute in Brookline, NH (sculpture park built on an old ski resort), Walden Pond in Concord, MA (also while you're near there: The DeCordova sculpture park, Sleepy Hollow cemetery where a punch of author's are buried,  and Pony Henge).

For scenic drives hit the New Hampshire coast. To see some cool old military stuff get out at Ordiorne Point in Rye, NH and keep going a little into Maine for Fort McClary in Kittery. Since you're up that way Portsmouth, NH is also a nice little walk-around town with a retired submarine.",t2_bofbb,ratbas,0,1640427492.0,0,t1_hpwkyiy,hpwkyiy,True,manaspachauri,t3_rny8za,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/rny8za/some_fun_things_to_do_in_the_city/,Some fun things to do in the city?,/r/LowellMA/comments/rny8za/some_fun_things_to_do_in_the_city/hpwkyiy/,7,r/LowellMA,0,7

"If there's two things I'd recommend in Lowell, it's mills and Cambodian food. Check out Pailin Plaza (Rose, Le Petit Cafe, etc.). For seeing some mills, you can do the riverwalk which lets you see the Boott and Appleton Mills. If you like history, definitely check out the Visitor Center and see the power looms at the Boott Mills Museum. Remember to wear a mask; the omicron variant is currently spreading rapidly. Other ideas:

* Go see Jesus (the ""Lowell Grotto"" near Franco American School)
* Get international food at the grocery store (Sophia's Greek Pantry, FoodLand International, Valentinas, Banyon Market) 
* Eat a Boot Mill Sandwich at Arthurs 
* Eat a sardine sandwich at Ma Cusine and learn about why he has 50 Bond figurines (hes not a collector)
* Go to the Lowell Cemetery and see some graves of governors. Then have a killer filling breakfast at the Corner Cafe.
* Check out the 3 record stores in 1 block radius: Garnick's, Vinyl Destination, RRR
* Use the 10$ weekend commuter rail pass to check out Boston 
* Get spooked at the Tewksbury Hospital and see the onsite public health museum
* Enjoy coffee at our many hipster establishments (Tiny Arms/Nibbana/Coffee & Cotton/Brewd)
* Get on the 41 bus to Lawrence and see more mills and eat amazing Dominican food 
* See the Pawtucket Falls and take a walk on the Vandenberg Esplanade

"I moved to Lowell 2 years ago, so here's my perspective of what the city has to offer, although I don't know specifics like if there's somewhere specific with techno.

The city has a good blend of quiet neighborhoods/proximity to very quiet towns/forests, while also having a downtown that has places (bars and such) open late.

As someone who was just living in Boston before Lowell, Lowell isn't the same size with the same options of Boston, but there's plenty.  I always say ""Lowell has absolutely everything I need during the week and there's stuff to do, but it's close enough to Boston if I want something specific on a weekend""

To respond to one of your questions in another comment thread, there's a commuter rail train to Boston (it's the Lowell line, ends here).  It's not fast, nor does it come that often (about once an hour on average) but it's definitely an option and I'd certainly recommend going into Boston at least a couple times, even if it isn't a regular part of your week/month.

There's certainly plenty of food around of all sorts, and there's bars with music - one of the first things I did after moving was finding Thirsty First's annual punk show with a ton of local bands.  Not a club, but definitely a place with live music.

Events and attractions are posted various places- pre-pandemic I usually just checked Google Maps and saw a few random events in case something new caught my eye, there's also random Facebook groups that sometimes post things going on.",t2_pf3sz,CodeLenny,0,1640013193.0,0,t1_hpavwei,hpavwei,True,alina7penguin,t3_rkkleu,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/rkkleu/what_to_do_in_lowell/,What to do in Lowell,/r/LowellMA/comments/rkkleu/what_to_do_in_lowell/hpavwei/,8,r/LowellMA,0,8

Rush hour in all of eastern Massachusetts is terrible, so unfortunately that‚Äôs not really something that you can avoid. However, you‚Äôd be going the opposite direction of the main flow if you‚Äôre driving north in the morning/south at night.

Much of Lowell‚Äôs bad reputation came during the 80s and 90s. The Lowell of today is much different looking than the Lowell of back then.

One of the more frustrating things about Lowell is the rising rent prices, but this is true everywhere in eastern Massachusetts.

"As a taxpayer, and history buff, I like the cobblestones. I don't see any paved streets in Lowell, other than Andover Street, that lasted. They paste over cracks and movement joints and tear it up and do-over a few years later. I'm 40 and never seen work have to be done to the cobblestones. That was a great endeavor putting them in. A very green material indeed. A lot of the cobblestones were so we'll installed, they paved over them rather than trying to unEarth them. Another couple decades they can do a reveal of the cobblestones. A simple 10lb sledge will break up the pavement and lift it off the rock. It's not like there was any bonding agent to attach pave to stone anyhow. Typical cold joint.

"What do you like to do? Go do that. 

Need suggestions? 

Go to each of the 6 museums in the city

Go to the Pollard Library, admire the architecture, see the historical and beautiful murals that cover the walls of the 2nd floor, check out the 5ft tall priceless Japanese Vase and learn why it lives in Lowell. 

Walk the River Walk until you get hungry then go find something on or just off Merrimack St to eat. (There are like 35 places between Middlesex Community College and City Hall.)

Vandenberg Esplanade is a beautiful walk/run/ride/sit destination. And the UMASS Lowell boat house rents out canoes and kayaks for just a few bucks. 

There is also a beach into the river along the esplanade (for warmer days) 

Do you like Bowling? Bolero is a good spot and they have leagues you can join.

You will find no shortage of volunteer work. The Lowell Litter Krew is well known and are on this subreddit to find and meet. Go magnet fishing in the canals. 

We need more people to help run the election polling places, mostly older people are helping and they need help. 

Adopt a piece of Lowell through the parks department and keep it beautiful.

"I will bite.  

Nashua is a fine commute. No problem.   

I think you'll be priced out in Tyngsborough, Dunstable, Westford.    Maybe parts of Dracut too.  

Yes, you'll miss out on Zero income tax in Mass.   Pelham NH is safe and possibly affordable, but dead* 

Dracut is also safe, but partially dead.  Mostly dead*.  

In Lowell, Look for an Apartment downtown if you want activity* around you.   Look in the Highlands if you want some quiet.  Highlands will have space for your car (most likely).  Downtown will not (most likely.) However, there are three Downtown garages, priced very reasonably* and they're conveniently placed.  You'll always have room in one or another and can get your car off the road during snow emergencies.... not to mention, covered parking during same.  

Don't expect a big apartment with luxury* amenities and you can do fine for $1800 in Lowell.  Check Craigslist.  

Many apartments are in old homes.   Get used to this-- you're not necessarily going to land in an ""apartment  building."" more likely it's a unit that's been carved out of a house or it's someone's condo.  This is all quite normal here.   I'd embrace the quirky architecture of an old home, myself.  

Wife and I moved to the Acre and had NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. YMMV.  Stay west of Fletcher, east of School, and North of Broadway, and you're probably in reasonably good shape.  

If the ad says ""Belvedere,"" check the address:  if it's east of Rt 38 you're definitely safe.  If it's west toward Downtown, it depends.   

*****ASTERISKS: I have no idea what your values or experiences are, let alone your expectations. Garage parking in our region can be like $40.00 a day, so the $60.00 a month-ish here in town is quite reasonable bordering on dirt cheap.    The clubs and bars aren't open 'til 3, which may be good or bad, depending on your point of view, and the City is embracing for those who appreciate different cultures, foods, viewpoints. 2 breweries, plenty of bars, sub & pizza shop on every corner-- you'll find yours; sample widely.    Landed here 18 years ago and fell in love immediately.   

Lots to do, lots of history, an Urban National Park and really cool vibe.  College town, but still has vibrancy among full time residents too.
