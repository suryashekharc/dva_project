"you have the [shootout](https://lakeoftheozarksshootout.com/), labor day and memorial day are huge. other weekends are chill but these weekends and maybe the 4th are choppy so have a boat that can handle it. there's swim up bars from swimming pool or lake around. i really miss bikinis and martinis, they used to have a high swimming pool and a lower deck helipad. million dollar cove isn't what it used to be but i always boat by augie busch's place. bagnell dam strip is special, expect a couple hours traffic jam just to get in on hot weekends. look at a cabin instead of a motel/hotel. you can do about $300 a night next to the water.

"Branson is a big tourist hot spot, Marvel Cave is definitely a sight to see over at Silver Dollar City as well. Table Rock lake has tons of boating opportunities. Gas is also pretty cheap in the area in case that’s a worry. As far as places to stay, if you’re fortunate enough to find a room, I recommend staying in a hotel and not one of the many many motels along 76 Country Blvd. If you’ve got money to splurge Big Cedar, just south of Branson is a great outdoorsy hotspot with tons and tons of (expensive) things to do with about a 20-30 minute drive to Branson.

"It depends what you're going for but Arkansas definitely earns its nickname ""The Natural State"" Missouri has some nice parks but nothing that rivals the Buffalo National River and Ozark National Forest in Northwest Arkansas in my opinion.

I live in Las Vegas now but grew up in Branson, MO. That's a decent little tourist town good for a couple days, it's more of a family vacation town but there's some fun to be had if traveling there with friends. If you've never been to St. Louis you might as well do a stop a long the way; the Arch is really cool to see in person, there's a lot of good restaurants, plus there's a lot more fun and relatively cheap things to do like City Museum and Forest Park.

If you're interested in Arkansas' nature you can check out my YouTube channel, I've done a ton of hiking in the area.

"**[Killifish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killifish)** 
 
 >A killifish is any of various oviparous (egg-laying) cyprinodontiform fish (including families Aplocheilidae, Cyprinodontidae, Fundulidae, Profundulidae and Valenciidae). All together, there are 1,270 species of killifish, the biggest family being Rivulidae, containing more than 320 species. As an adaptation to living in ephemeral waters, the eggs of most killifish can survive periods of partial dehydration. Many of the species rely on such a diapause, since the eggs would not survive more than a few weeks if entirely submerged in water.

"Northern Arkansas is my favorite region, there's so much to do!  Some really good suggestions on here already, but here would be my list if I had a few days in Northwest Arkansas:

[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art](https://crystalbridges.org/) in Bentonville.  It's a world class art museum, and just amazing, and free.

While you're in Bentonville [rent some mountain bikes](https://www.phattirebikeshop.com/articles/bike-rentals-pg386.htm) and ride some top notch trails.  When I say top notch, I mean it.  They may or may not be the worlds greatest mountain bike trails, but they are absolutely the best maintained and are truly innovative.  Bentonville calls itself the [mountain bike capitol of the world](https://www.visitbentonville.com/things-to-do/mtb-mountain-bike-capital-of-the-world/).  People in Whistler laugh, but it's no joke.  If even two of the people in your group ride bikes, at any level, you should make time for this.  Ride the All-American trail, Choo-Choo, and Leopard's Loop at least.  

Hike around Eureka Springs.  There is so much to see and do.  You can spend the whole day (or multiple days) just walking around the neighborhoods.  Eureka Springs also has insane mountain biking, but not as dense or approachable as Bentonville.  Eureka Springs also has one of my favorite skate parks in the country.  It may not be the best skating, but the setting is out of this world.  There's no signs and you can't see it from the street, so you have to know it's there.",t2_af923,WendyArmbuster,0,1640489377.0,0,t1_hpzjtsl,hpzjtsl,True,dontgoforthe1,t3_rojtfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ozarks/comments/rojtfz/traveling_through_arkansas_with_family_and/,Traveling through Arkansas with family and requesting advice on visit,/r/ozarks/comments/rojtfz/traveling_through_arkansas_with_family_and/hpzjtsl/,3,r/ozarks,0,3

"Check out the [Ozarks Haints N Hooch podcast](https://ozarkshaintsnhooch.weebly.com/). They drill down into one ""big"" and one ""little"" story per episode, along with a cocktail themed to match the stories. They're a fun listen. 

Anyone who is serious about learning Ozark folklore should check out the books of Vance Randolph. He was a folklorist who did most of his work cataloging the stories of southwestern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas in the early 20th century. His books are hard to find to purchase, but they're widely available in public libraries in the Ozarks, and you can often find copies online. 

To add my local stories/sites from in and around Phelps County, check out:

\- Spook Hollow Road near St. James, along with its resident goatman;

\- Highway 72 between Rolla and Salem, which is supposedly infested with flying saucers; and

\- Crawford County, which according to some sources has one of the highest per capita rates of Bigfoot sitings in the country (although obviously the proper term is ""MoMo,"" aka ""Missouri Monster,"" rather than Bigfoot).

"**Paddleboard:** There are some nice spots near the Table Rock Visitor Center, and a place you can park right across the dam from the visitor center. A fun, easy paved bike path goes from the visitor center to the state park marina - about 4 miles.

**Mountain Bike:** There is a great network of mtb trails right across from the dam. There are 3 different places to park depending if you want to finish with a downhill or start with a downhill. My favorite place to park is the one kind of across from the branson showboat. Just check the website because part of the trail closes during some hunting seasons.

[https://www.trailforks.com/region/white-river-trails-12651/](https://www.trailforks.com/region/white-river-trails-12651/)

Also, Two Rivers mtb park is not far from Branson and totally worth checking out. [https://www.trailforks.com/region/two-rivers-bike-park/](https://www.trailforks.com/region/two-rivers-bike-park/)

There are also trails at busiek but I've never rode them. 

**General outdoors** \- I enjoy hiking the trails at Henning. There is a short trail to a tower overlook and a longer loop that goes to a few waterfalls which are probably dry right now. 

Outside of Branson if you want more solitude Piney Creek Wilderness and Hercules Glade Wilderness are both great places to hike.

Never been to Dogwood Canyon but it's heard it's really fun to explore - pricey though.

"Just found this sub and there's not a lot of posts, so this is a super late reply.

I'm on the outskirts of Joplin, just outside city limits. Not exactly where you want but I can give you some numbers. I just bought a house Aug 2020, half acre with septic and well water, 3 bedroom 2 bath, like 1200 sqft listed but the actual space is quite a bit bigger. Original build was 1967 but they've done several add ons and some (shitty) renovations. Fireplaces, decent decks, and a double 2 car garage, mostly fenced. I'm like 3 blocks from Shoal creek so while I don't have river access it's still extremely close. We paid $135k for that. Another property we looked at was more rural but just across the street from river access, 5 acres and a smaller house for the same price.

On zillow there's only like 3 plots of land for sale that meet your criteria. The home building process is extremely fucked right now if you weren't aware. Most contractors that I know are booked out for months and turning down jobs. There's tons of supply issues. Price of lumber was crazy high last year, it's pretty much back to normal now.  There's just straight up [shortages of random things](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/pandemic-demand-causes-unprecedented-building-supply-shortage) like paint, concrete, sand, windows, doors, appliances, etc. If you do build it might take 2 years longer than normal if you want specific things and waiting for builder availability, plus costs are high.

"**[Big Piney River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Piney_River)** 
 
 >The Big Piney River is a 110-mile-long (180 km) tributary of the Gasconade River in south central Missouri in the United States. Via the Gasconade and Missouri rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River basin. The stream headwaters are located in southwest Texas County just north of the community of Dunn and U. S. Route 60. The stream flows east and southeast passing just south of Cabool passing under Route 60 Business, Missouri Route 181 and U. S. Route 63.

"**Update Jackson Street (Route 14) Widening Project - Ozark MO - Pedestrian Passageway weak link?  Time will tell.**

  
In geotechnical engineering, a nuclear densometer or soil density gauge is a field instrument used to determine the density of a compacted material. The device uses the interaction of gamma radiation with matter to measure density, either through direct transmission or the ""backscatter"" method.

  
How do you test soil for compaction?  
The best way to test is to probe the soil with a compaction tester to a depth of 36"" to 48"". The testing rod should move down through the soil with steady, even pressure, Hard, compacted soils resist penetration with the rod. Often penetration abruptly stops at a fairly uniform depth across a field or landscape area.  


Methods of Soil Density Testing  
The typical field soil compaction testing methods comprise using a nuclear meter, and a sand-cone. Other test methods are less preferred due to their inefficiency in the field (such as a tube-density sampler or a balloon density device).

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"I definitely consider the ozarks to be magical wilderness and all of the things you listed can be found here. 

However ""peaks"" with insane views are relatively rare in the ozarks due to the trees and the fact that much of hilly terrain is not actually peaks but ridges and valleys.

The other thing to be aware of is the time of year you mentioned is when non-spring-fed streams/waterfalls are at their lowest or even completely dry. The ozarks are the most ""magical"" in the spring when it's lush and green, wildflowers are blooming, and water is everywhere. Fall is a close second because of colored trees but it's often dry. 

Of the places I've been here are my favorites for overnight:

Ozark Trail from powder mill to Stegall Mountain - It's not even close to the highest point in the ozarks but you can camp on the summit with a **great** view. Along the way you'll pass Klepzig Mill and Rocky Falls and a few other neat points of interest. Just note there is NO WATER on Stegall Mountain. 

Also I really like Hercules Glade Wilderness east of Branson. It has one area (off trail) that has an exposed summit with a hella great view. There are lots of great places to camp and Long Creek (when it's flowing) has the sound and feel of a legit mountain stream. There are several waterfalls in the area that are just rad.

"If you're interested in printing and binding technologies, the old Ozark Family Bibles weren't clay tablets or anything--they were just the typical printed books of the day. Even 100 and 200 years ago, there were well-established printing industries in America, and the Bible was a big seller. The Ozarks were isolated back then, but not so isolated that Bibles couldn't make it in. 

If your question is about the translation that was most common, I haven't seen an old Bible that wasn't King James.

Something to bear in mind, though, is that the old time Ozarks weren't as religiously devout as some assume. It was easy to be unchurched when you lived in a remote holler, and one reason you might move to a remote holler was to get away from church people. Nowadays the stereotype of the region often focuses on religiosity, but there was also a very strong anti-religious streak in the people of the Ozarks. Truth be told, the anti-religious folks in the hills served as substantial inspiration to the revival preachers of the sort we tend to remember nowadays.",t2_68dbwb47,MissouriOzarker,0,1626094094.0,0,t1_h4wxs15,h4wxs15,True,sweaty_stinky_balls,t3_oh30aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ozarks/comments/oh30aj/what_bibles_did_people_own_in_the_past/,What Bibles did people own in the past?,/r/ozarks/comments/oh30aj/what_bibles_did_people_own_in_the_past/h4wxs15/,3,r/ozarks,0,3

He would walk home every night around midnight when his evening shift ended. He's not easily scared, he's a big guy, not superstitious. But he literally RAN in the door one night-- Said he was being followed by someTHING.

Apparently he thought he was hearing a dog barking, but as it got closer he realized it was the sound of a PERSON, imitating a dog bark, so he booked it, and it chased him all the way back home.

"Okay, I have a full keyboard and a few moments to spare, so I can be more verbose about a topic I adore. 

First, I've never heard stories of windego in the Ozarks. I'm sure that there are some folks who tell those stories and probably even think that they've encountered one of those critters, but those tales haven't reached my ears or eyes.

As for the Howler, that's a cryptic critter I adore. I think that most of the stories about them probably are based on big cats (aka, ""paints"") screeching, maybe along with a few bear sightings, but they're still great stories. That said, the one time I maybe heard a Howler it sounded more humanlike than any big cat I've ever heard. That one time was more than 30 years ago with my parents and grandparents. Both my dad and my grandpa were flummoxed by the sound and didn't know what it was. Granted, neither of those men were (or in my father's case are) devoted outdoorsmen, but both of them spent a lot of time hunting and foraging out of necessity on our farm over the years. A screech that they didn't recognize is enough to make you at least pause and wonder, ya know? That sound we heard together so long ago probably was just a big cat of some variety feeling like mixing up its calls for the evening, but I can't say for sure.

Probably the most famous supernatural happening in the Ozarks after Howlers are ""spooklights.""The most famous of that phenomena is found down around Joplin. Basically, they're lights that hover and bob and behave a bit like a will-o'-the-wisp. A bit of internet searching will produce a bunch of stories about spooklights, all of which should be taken with a grain of salt. 

Then there's Bigfoot, which may or may not be the same thing as MoMo (short for ""Missouri Monster.""). The MoMo phenomenon began in Louisiana, Missouri, and involved a creature that resembled a Sasquatch or Bigfoot but was arguably different (I don't have time or space to get into all of the argument as to whether these unproven and likely fictitious creatures are the same or not). Of course, the City of Louisiana is not in the Ozarks, and the creature that was allegedly running around there may or may not be the same large biped frequently spotted in the Ozarks. I don't have the links at my fingertips, but allegedly the Ozarks in general and Crawford County in particular have a very high per capita rate of Bigfoot spottings. Alas, even though I'm in Crawford County often to visit family, I've never once seen a Bigfoot or a MoMo or anything else of that nature.

Something else I've never spotted is a flying saucer or other UFO, despite being out at night a good deal. Allegedly Highway 72 between Rolla and Salem is a hotbed for UFO activity, but I've never encountered anything along that stretch of road.

One of my favorite stories is of the ""goatman"" that is supposed to live on Spook Hollow Road near St. James (I'm from the St. James area). Basically, there's a cleverly named road that's sort of spooky at night and at least used to be a great place to take a girl on a date when you're both about 17. And there's supposed to be a creature with the body of a man and the head of a goat out there in the woods, as well as maybe a cult. Back in the day me and my buddies and sometimes a girl I was partial to would go out there looking for a goatman and a good time. All we ever found was a good time, which I count as a win. 

I'm about to have to scoot, but that's a good start. Of course, there's no end of haints that have allegedly troubled people or houses. My dad once owned a rental house and the tenant caused trouble claiming that it was haunted and that he needed to get the haint out. My guess is that she was short on rent, but who knows?",t2_68dbwb47,MissouriOzarker,0,1623258424.0,0,t1_h16azmx,h16azmx,True,CountySubstantial498,t3_nvipr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ozarks/comments/nvipr9/ozark_folklore/,Ozark Folklore,/r/ozarks/comments/nvipr9/ozark_folklore/h16azmx/,7,r/ozarks,0,7
"I love Ozark folklore. There are some great books out there about the subject. A couple of my favorites are by Vance Randolph are ""Pissing in the Snow and Other Ozark Folktales"" and ""Ozark Magic and Folklore"" the latter us more along the lines of superstitious beliefs, which I do love. Such as when to plant crops and weather superstitions or putting an axe under the bed to help with labor pain. 

I really love the ghost stories and stories about the cryptids as well. There's the Fouke Monster, but I don't think that counts as Ozarks since it's southern
Arkansas. If you're interested in the Fouke monster there's a movie roughly based on it called The Legend of Boggy Creek or something similar. 

You should also be able to find some books and websites about Ozark legends and ghost story type folktales.

"Allegiant has affordable nonstop flights from LAX to both Springfield (SGF) and Bentonville (XNA) depending on what specific activities you end up deciding to do.

* An overnight float trip on the Current or some of the other scenic rivers has no rival in my opinion - **just avoid weekends**! If you flew to SGF and made Branson your 'home base' you could hike Hercules Glade (one of my personal favorites) or even backpack overnight there. It's not too far from other great hiking or floating around upper buffalo in northern AR. And the Current/Jacks Fork/Eleven Point rivers aren't too far either. The Current has a cave you can kayak up inside.
* If you made Bentonville AR your base there is a lot of beautiful hiking in that area. Mountain biking is also super popular. Not as much floating though, at least that I know of. The Mulberry River is a fun float but will probably be dry in the summer. Buffalo is gorgeous.
* Third option is fly to St Louis and explore the eastern Missouri ozarks. I rarely make it out that way but it's very beautiful, probably my favorite in terms of scenery. Hawn State Park, Pickle Springs, various Shut-Ins, Elephant Rocks. This is the only part of the ozarks where you'll find granite. Some of our springs are insanely beautiful. 

If you are trying to decide between Missouri or Arkansas. The way I usually describe them... overall similar but Arkanas ozarks have more elevation and appearance of mountains. More waterfalls. A lot of areas with dark brown 'arkansas' sandstone.

Missouri is rolling plateaus with steep valleys that give the appearance of hills. Mostly karst topography limestone with lots of caves, springs and clear streams. One area has granite with formations we call shut ins... basically rapids jumbled with big boulders and small waterfalls between. Missouri seems to have more infrastructure in terms of developed trails and parks and information. 

Coming from CA you may not be used to our humidity if you come in the summer so just be prepared for that!

"There are many good options already listed out, but you can also fly into St. Louis and drive into the Ozarks real quick. Interstate 44 cuts southwest out of St. Louis and goes clear to Oklahoma (and further). I've known lots of folks who claim that you're not in the ""true"" Ozarks if you're within 30 or 40 miles of I-44, but even if you buy that (and I don't) the interstate is a handy way to access the area. 

I'm a Salem Plateau kind of guy living over here on the eastern portion of the Ozarks, so I would recommend things in my neck of the woods. Hit up [Maramec Springs Park](http://www.maramecspringpark.com) (it's a private park run by a non-profit foundation), [Meramec State Park](https://mostateparks.com/park/meramec-state-park) (same river, different place, different spelling of the old Native name), and state parks in the St. Francois Mountains like [Taum Sauk](https://mostateparks.com/park/taum-sauk-mountain-state-park), [Elephant Rocks](https://mostateparks.com/park/elephant-rocks-state-park), and [Johnson Shut-Ins](https://mostateparks.com/park/johnsons-shut-ins-state-park). Take a float down the Meramec and/or Current Rivers. 

In terms of accommodations, camping and smaller motels are going to be your best bets, although there are a few bed and breakfast operations that I have no personal experience with. 

You can't really go wrong in the area, though. While I'm a proud Missourian, I will admit that the Boston Mountains down in Arkansas are pretty, too. And while I prefer to live in my little home here on the Salem Plateau rather than to live on the Springfield Plateau in southwestern Missouri, I travel down I-44 to the southwest frequently and always enjoy my visits.",t2_68dbwb47,MissouriOzarker,0,1622750493.0,0,t1_h0hayj8,h0hayj8,True,novemberalphak,t3_nrdxtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ozarks/comments/nrdxtp/i_finally_have_the_time_and_money_to_go_on_my/,I finally have the time and money to go on my dream trip!,/r/ozarks/comments/nrdxtp/i_finally_have_the_time_and_money_to_go_on_my/h0hayj8/,3,r/ozarks,0,3

"If you are wanting higher difficulty and western ozarks I really enjoy Hercules Glade Wilderness, about 30 miles of trails and a waterfall. Long Creek has the look and sound of a true mountain stream and Pilot Knob is one of the few places in the ozarks where you can scramble up to a summit view that isn't covered in trees.

Piney Creek is a less known wilderness area that I like a lot. The trails can be pretty steep and strenuous. It's nice anytime but when the seasonal streams are flowing, it's particularly good. It's also one of the few or only places you can legally disperse camp on the lakeshore. These are both in the Branson area. 

I haven't done a ton much hiking down in Arkansas but there are some beautiful areas around the upper buffalo. 

If you were to stay around Branson you'd be in a decent position to hit up the areas I mentioned and pop down into AR as well.

Very rustic but enough creature comforts to not feel like frontiersmen. The dude built the cabins himself. It's a 700acre property full of animals like longhorn steer, great pyrenes, and exotic birds he keeps on the property. 

It's very nearby to a small Forest Service lake and you're between the Current River and the Eleven Point River, great float spots. 

The Greer Spring Trail is nice. I know there's a trail at The Narrows. There's Falling Spring Mill, Boze Mill, Turner Mill, which are all pretty cool.

"To echo what others are asking, where are you? The Ozarks are freaking huge, so you probably don't want to go looking for fun activities in Rolla if you're living around Fayetteville. 

That said, you mentioned hiking and fishing, and those are certainly two popular activities that the Ozarks provide in excellent quality and astounding abundance. I definitely recommend both, especially the hiking since it never really goes out of season if you have the right gear. 

Wherever you are, I am pretty sure that there's some live music and quirky museums at least sort of near at hand. I'm not talking anything fancy (although some of our bigger cities have pretty fancy music venues and swank museums), but things like the [Harlin Museum](https://harlinmuseum.com) in West Plains are fun. 

There's also the question of how old your son is and what his interests are. When I was a kid, I loved [4-H](https://4-h.org). My participation in 4-H taught me a lot about things like, well, hiking and fishing, but also about things like how to run a meeting and do community service. Most of all, I made a lot of friends in 4-H. 4-H is sort of old-fashioned, I guess, but there's still a lot of 4-H clubs throughout the Ozarks. They may be worth checking out. I'm less familiar with some of the other youth clubs and activities are around, but 4-H is by no means the only option there. 

I should also promote one of my favorite inter-generational activities as a child that I still do with four generations of my family: gardening. Gardening is big in the Ozarks. Some of my earliest, fondest memories are helping my great-grandpa tend his tomatoes, and the odds are good that your son might enjoy growing something with his mom. If you have the room, it's not too late to start something like a watermelon or cucumber or okra or even sweet corn, but you probably will want to look for quick maturing options. And it's never too late (or too early) to plant radishes, and you always have room for them if you have room for a container of soil, although hot weather might make them taste a little more fiery than you would like. 

That's just the tip of the iceberg, though.

"I've started and stopped a reply a couple of times because it's a struggle to articulate my thoughts on the Ozarks as a cultural region right now. First, I should say that I'm happy to help in anyway I can, but that I'm simultaneously pessimistic and optimistic about a renaissance of Ozark culture and historical awareness. 

I'm a pessimist because I think that people are always oblivious about their history and community, and I don't think that Ozarkers are any different. Most people don't think much about local history, and most people aren't on Reddit. Throw in how relatively sparsely our region is populated and how the region skews a bit older (and therefore less internet savvy) and it's a real heavy lift to have a vibrant Ozark community on here (although I love this sub reddit, I really wish there were more of us posting more frequently). 

I'm an optimist because there are some really good things going on. Blogs like Ozarks Alive and the Accidental Ozarkian, as well as podcasts like Ozarks Haints 'n Hooch, are both recording and creating Ozark culture. I'm doing my own little screwball projects to try to contribute to Ozark culture as well (I won't promote those here, but I've posted about some of them before), and it sounds like you're sort of in the game as well. All over, I encounter people, often younger than me (I'm nearly 50) who are interested in learning about the region, its people, its history, and its culture. Sure, they're a small minority of the population, but it's more important to have a few enthusiastic, talented people than sheer numbers! I think that we're maybe turning a corner. I sure hope so.

Anyhow, like I said, I'm happy to help if I can. I will shoot you a message (or message me) to discuss things more. For the moment, I have to check a couple of things off of a honey-do list to ensure that my bride will remain pleased with me.

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE & AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE & AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

"In my opinion May is maybe the best month of the year for the ozarks. The explosion of lush greens is just stunning and the streams are often flowing, although it's been pretty dry here (Missouri) lately.

"My favorite cafe story: my dad was helping fill the cooler with 8-ounce sodas (or pop, as my grandparents called it) and found a Dr. Pepper bottle with a clearly visible unsmoked cigarette in it. He showed it to my grandfather, who said, “Gimme that,” and put it in on a very visible shelf behind the cash register.

A few days later, the delivery route driver comes in, sees the bottle with the cigarette in it, and asks, “Walter, can I have that bottle? I’ll pay you for it.”
“Nope.”
This goes around a couple more times, with the driver offering a couple of free cases. My grandfather won’t budge.
Finally, after a few weeks, the sales manager comes in and says, “What’ll it take, Walter?”

"The story behind this:

My Uncle Lawrence ran a still for himself and a few family and friends, set up in some holler near Parthenon, Arkansas. As with many other reformed drinkers, he traded in the firewater for the living waters (probably because Aunt Helen gave him an ultimatum) later in life. At a family reunion in 1986 or so, my dad said, “Why don’t you see if Lawrence will tell you how he made his shine.” I did, and Lawrence said, “Let’s go off a ways.” We left the pavilion and I wrote down everything he told me. 

By the way, wheat shorts is basically animal feed, and it was cheaper than corn—that’s why he used it. That, and I would imagine buying a hundred pounds of corn from the feed store in Jasper when you don’t raise hogs might attract the attention of a revenue agent.",t2_7b72ngqz,Electrical_Prune6545,0,1615653418.0,0,t1_gqt82vo,gqt82vo,True,Electrical_Prune6545,t3_m49u25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ozarks/comments/m49u25/my_uncle_lawrences_moonshine_recipe_written_down/,"My Uncle Lawrence’s moonshine recipe, written down at a family reunion at Pruitt Landing around 1986-7",/r/ozarks/comments/m49u25/my_uncle_lawrences_moonshine_recipe_written_down/gqt82vo/,11,r/ozarks,0,11

"the part about the ozarks that the mountains to the east don’t have nearly as much of and that’s major beef production, and it’s why there is so much more of a western influence in the ozarks. There is also way more Poc in the Appalachian areas, soul food isn’t around in the ozarks, ozarks have almost strictly oak hardwoods, it’s much less populated and more isolated in the ozarks, there are some tourist attractions in the ozarks, but Branson mo would be the largest city of that type, as opposed to say, Gatlinburg.. it’s nothing.

"I would recommend parking at Hemmed in Hollow trailhead and taking that Trail (white blazes I believe) to Hemmed in Hollow. After enjoying Hemmed In Hollow go up river on the Old River Trail (Yellow Blazes) until you reach a turnoff for Centerpoint trail heading up the hill on the right. Take Centerpoint up to the Goat Trail on Big Bluff. You you follow the entire bluff you can take a spur trail back down to the river. Camp wherever you like (except on the actual bluff on Goat Trail or close to Hemmed in Hollow).

The next day hike up the Sneed's Creek trail and back to your vehicle. You will want the Buffalo River West Trails Illustrated Map. You can get it online or like others said JB's Outfitter right by the trailhead should have maps, also the Buffalo Outdoor Center down in Ponca usually has some.

I also pay like 20 bucks a year to download maps to use for offline use on the all trails app and it works with your phones gos. I have found that helpful a few times as well. You might consider that as well.

"I was born in the 70s, so can only speak to the late 20th century. People around me sometimes wore small, plain gold, silver, or other metal crosses.

"Exactly this. Growing up in the 1970’s and 1980’s, crosses weren’t worn and weren’t displayed outside of a church EXCEPT for the Catholic families in the area.

The Ozarks are more culturally limited than Appalachia, which can broadly be split between the north and the south.  I know the OP is likely referring to southern Appalachia and the Tennessee Valley, which feels very similar to the Ozarks.

I think mining is, or was, more prevalent in Appalachia.  The same is true for livestock in the Ozarks.

More recently, there has been an influx of Hispanics and those cultures in NW AR and SW MO.

"I think that there are certain cultures that trend in the same directions, and the lesser of those get heavily influenced by the more prolific of them. Sort of like substrates in linguistics.

For instance, rodeos and cowboy kind of stuff is pretty popular in the Ozarks, but we were never 10-gallon-hat, wild-west cowboys. We were poor farmers with a few cattle. Western movies appeal to the machismo of our own Ozarks culture, and there was not an ""Ozarks Movie"" genre, so we latched onto the closest thing. The same with country music talking about Texas. There wasn't other popular media to consume that was specifically for Rural Ozarkians, so they listened to the closest thing they had and were influenced by it.

"Arkansas ozarks are definitely more southern because at that point you're actually in the south. 

Missouri is not a southern state but there are parts that are somewhat mistaken as being southern because of the ozark/redneck culture which is in many ways similar to the south.

"The ozarks on both sides of the state line are beautiful (ESPECIALLY IN OCTOBER) and both have great hiking and scenery. The 'mountains' on the Arkansas side are a bit larger (but still small by mountain standards) and there are more waterfalls (many will be dry now though) and more sandstone rocks. The Missouri side has more springs and caves due to limestone/karst topography. One part of the Missouri ozarks features an unusual type of granite with a feature called ""shut ins"".

The crowded areas will be the rapidly growing Bentonville-Fayetteville cluster of towns which attract a lot of mountain bikers. The other crowded area will be Branson in Missouri which is by far the most touristy town in the region. But it's still not a big town. I wouldn't describe Eureka Springs as crowded - it's very interesting.

In my opinion the parks and trails are nicer in Missouri than Arkansas unless you are talking about the booming metro area inside Bentonville,etc. Arkansas has a lot of great trails but it's sometimes more difficult to find them.

If you are set on visiting Bentonville then Devils Den is not far and has some good trails. Others have mentioned some other good areas nearby.

You could also stay in/near Eureka Springs and then you'd be closer to the excellent Buffalo River area trails, as well as Hercules Glade, Roaring River, Piney Creek and others just across the line in Missouri. 

Another suggestion is stay around Farmington, MO and each day check out a different state park. There are SO MANY in that part of Missouri. Tall pines, deep blue springs, a couple rocky summits - some granite boulder strewn streams that in pictures look more like Colorado than the midwest. I love that area.

Another beautiful area I am keen to is the ONSR area - if you can get a reservation at Echo Bluff state park it's in the heart of that area. Beautiful trails, rivers, springs. Lots of good day hikes.

"I generally agree with this, but in my experience it's more true the further north you are in the Ozarks.

"A great place to go to experience the beauty of the ozarks is the buffalo national river and camp at Kyle’s landing. Hike hawksbill Craig, and lost valley. Maybe camp at horseshoe canyon ranch if you are a rock climber. 

Eureka springs would be a cool place to stay, they have lots of vegan friendly restaurants. It’s a tourist town but only because it’s so pretty. 

There is a little Ozark town called jasper that’s right in the heart of the buffalo river and the Ozark mountains, but they don’t really have vegan/ vegetarian restaurants. It’s a very small town. 

If you were wanting to do stuff in Bentonville like go to crystal bridges, and have more restaurant options, I would recommend staying in bentonville, it’s very pretty. 

Bentonville is a booming city and the headquarters to Walmart. Their town square is very pretty. 

Eureka springs is a tourist town. But the hipsters paradise. The town is beautiful and very friendly to the LGBT community. I love eureka springs 

Jasper is in the middle of the Ozark mountains and has its tourist spots but is a small town that is mostly untouched by the world. If you want to experience small town USA this is the place. Jasper and it’s surrounding areas in my opinion has the best camping and hiking.

"Kingston/Ponca area might be nice.  I think there are several cabins out that way.  Carrol or Madison County.  Close to Eureka (less than an hour) but even more rural.  The other direction is Harrison (gorgeous area but not a lovely city) and Yellville area (White River, I think?).   They are pretty but Eureka has the best VIBE and is actually close to Benton County, where the museum is, which is great.  The town of Eureka Springs is VERY SMALL. Like less than 3k locals.  So, it is touristy, but it's gorgeous and very very Victorian and quaint. Super artsy and anti-corporate.  Ask where you are looking at booking how busy they are! Most of the buildings are tiny B&Bs with maybe 6 or 10 rooms.  There are bigger hotels, but tons of hole in the wall places, too!  I love Eureka so much, if you can stay there, I would!  


 Really, all that stuff is within a few hours of each other, because Arkansas is tiny and NWA has good highways connecting it.  If you want a scenic route, try the Pig Trail-Hwy 23 instead of the interstate.

Baby boomers are retiring and buying land to play with or live on - the other post hit the nail on the head, they'll build a home, drill a well, spend about $25,000 to get electric on site, and put up a cutesy sign that says ""So-and-So Ranch"". They live there for about 10 years then get too old to take care of it and don't want to be out in the sticks. 

Plus now because of the pandemic, people (especially boomers who don't need an income) are leaving expensive crowded areas and larger cities (even within Missouri) and coming to rural Missouri with dreams of homesteading and living the idyllic simple life.

"The Ozarks is one of the few places with undeveloped land that is still cheap. It's also still owned in very large tracts that are coming up for sale as the Greatest Generation owners die and pass it to their children who already own land elsewhere, or when the boomers who run the company that owns it decide to retire. When these larger tracts get sold, they get broken up into 20-40 acre sections which are very affordable for people from other states where the land is super expensive. In the area where my parents live in Howell Co, MO, this has been happening for about 20 years already. A couple retires and wants to move out of the suburbs and give the country life a try, where the cost of living is cheaper and the retirement checks go further.

Seconding the suggestion to check out Brooks Blevins' work. He is a professor at Missouri State whose specialty is Ozark Studies. He's native to the Ozarks and has several books in publication. I just started his ""Hill Folks,"" which looks good so far. 



Regarding music: I didn't know it at the time, but my church congregation may have sung in a traditional rural Ozark style. We used a shape note/sheet music hybrid hymnal (Heavenly Highway Hymns or Hymnal) that I believe was published out of Pangburn, Arkansas. Our singing style was very unadorned and straightforward - no vibrato unless you were just so old or nervous your voice shook, and the only real embellishment was the occasional lift on the end of the last note at the end of a phrase. Sister Harris, who was very old, sounded like a cross between a bluejay and an angel, and by God, when she sang, I believed. I thought I was a good singer,, but when I started school in town and auditioned for choir, the choir director told me I didn't really ""sing.""

Brooks Blevins has a great trilogy on the Ozarks, and the first book in the series, The Old Ozarks, covers the history from the formation of the land through 1860 and is a pretty great intro into the region and its culture. He extensively covers Native Americans and their history in the region as well which is often overlooked in folk culture. African American influence and history is discussed as well.

"I heartily second the Vance Randolph suggestion. He's already done most of the work here. 

With regard to the dialect and language, and for that matter music, your best bet is to look for some old recordings. I think that at least Missouri State University and the University of Arkansas have some that can be accessed online. Once again, Vance Randolph is a great source on this front if you can't track down audio files. 

There aren't many folks that still talk the old way around anymore. I'm old enough to have listened to relatives born in the first years of the Twentieth Century talk, and I can't replicate it, much less describe the nuances in a simple comment. The pronunciations aren't Southern or Appalachian or Midwestern, although there are hints of all of those American dialects there. It's something that was unique but that has pretty much been lost due to national radio and television. 

On the topic of music, something that I dimly remember from the old timers, and which I now know was a musical tradition of the region, is the old-fashioned a cappella songs. Almeda Riddle is the best known example of the style in the Ozarks. Riddle's recordings are a little hard to find, but her singing resembled some of the a cappella work by the more famous Ralph Stanley (Ralph was an Appalachian Blue Grass musician who also sang some of the old songs that sprang from the same British Isle sources as the old music in the Ozarks).

In my experience, religion in the Ozarks used to feature a few ardent evangelists and a whole lot of ambivalent hill folk who reckoned they had better things to do than go to church--things like drinking and fighting and working.

"Grad student in theatre here who has adapted Ozark folklore for the stage in the past. You'll want to know about [Vance Randolph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_Randolph). He's widely considered the greatest Ozark folklorist. Most of his stuff is probably going to be hardcopy books (I don't know of a lot of digital resources), but it's not hard to find. I found them for sale and at local libraries in Texas when I lived there, and even found a few more books in Portland now that I'm living in the PNW--so they're out there.

Most of the books are anthologies of folklore and anecdotes he collected over a number of years, but he has a few others that cover a wide array of Ozark culture: *Ozark Folk Songs* is a 4-volume collection of songs and poetry; *Ozark Magic and Folklore* is his most prevalent work in my opinion and probably the closest you'll get to ""religion,"" as it ""contains a vast amount of folkloristic material, including legends, beliefs, ritual verses and sayings and odd practices of the hillpeople, plus a wealth of general cultural data"" (according to [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ozark-Magic-Folklore-Vance-Randolph/dp/0486211819)). And judging by his Wikipedia page, it looks like some of his earlier works involve folk customs and mannerisms, but I have yet to read those.

On that map, it ends at Twin Falls. But just 15 minutes' walk further, you can see Richland Falls too.  I've drawn a little map here over google maps. when you come from Sandstone Castle (the red trail on my map), you cross over the waterfall on the right (about 50-100 feet from the waterfall itself). There is a tall, washed-out area on the far side that you have to climb. After you climb that, you should look in the downstream direction, and you will see an old road bed going up the hill. Follow that trail around the hill. It will go up for a ways, change directions to go more rightward toward Richland Falls, and it will go downhill. After it goes downhill, there will be a split in the trails. Going off to the left will take you to Richland Creek, but not to the falls. Going straight takes you to the falls. Continue straight, and you will come to a place where there is another chance to go left and down to the creek. This is the one you want to take. After that, you should be able to hear and see the falls.

"It reminds me of An admirer of Shakespeare released 60 European Starlings into Central Park in the 1890s in a misbegotten attempt to populate the American landscape with all birds celebrated — or at least mentioned — by the bard. Once established, these birds, which originally inhabited Europe, southwestern Asia, and North Africa, quickly spread.

Starlings now occupy all of the continental United States, and with a population of 46 million, they are among our most common songbirds. Even so, their numbers have dropped by more than half over the last 50 years.

It's estimated that Starlings cause more than $800 million in crop damage each year in the United States. In addition, they often evict native birds from their nests, which has raised concerns about their impact on other species' reproductive rates. They are also known to carry a variety of avian diseases (transmissible gastroenteritis, blastomycosis, and salmonella), and their droppings provide a growth medium for Histoplasma capsulatum, a fungus that causes lung infections in humans.",t2_2hjblwcr,BadAccount888,0,1596690205.0,0,t1_g0j15zq,g0j15zq,False,Maxwyfe,t3_hvg8te,https://www.reddit.com/r/ozarks/comments/hvg8te/alligator_found_in_lake_taneycomo_kolr/,Alligator found in Lake Taneycomo | KOLR,/r/ozarks/comments/hvg8te/alligator_found_in_lake_taneycomo_kolr/g0j15zq/,1,r/ozarks,0,1

"FYI your post is kind of vague. What are you asking? Where to move to?

Bull Shoals Lake and Norfork Lake in Northern Arkansas are probably the most beautiful lakes in this region in terms of scenery and water visibility, but they're in the middle of no where so jobs are few and far between.

Table Rock & Lake of the Ozarks are both much more developed with large tourism industries. Both are so big, you can totally find a peaceful cove, but the main body of these lakes can get quite busy during holiday weekends. 

Missouri is not really known for (but should be) it's large concentration of Class 1 freshwater springs. We have a cluster of the biggest springs in the world and they feed entire rivers that run clear and cold all year round. Check out the Current River, Jacks Fork River, Eleven Point River, Black River and Norfork Rivers. Those all are world-class beautiful streams. 

Missouri doesn't have the dramatic scenery of ""out West"" but we have plenty of beauty and our parks aren't always packed to the gills.

"Re: Lake of the Ozarks, yes!  It is man-made and the water gets gnarly.   My in-laws lived there for many years and when we went boating my FIL would swim with me, no problem (he is from there) , but my MIL and husband would  BEG me not to jump in and talk about how disgusting the water was and never ever swam in the lake water in the ten years I knew them there.    


Honestly, the Ozarks are really lovely and have a lot of smaller rivers that may be what you are looking for, but Lake of the Ozarks specifically is probably not it, although it is beautiful. It is very touristy, in that ALL the economy is built on tourism, and the town shrinks in the winter.

 Lake of the Ozarks, is what I would consider the upper-most region of the Ozarks, so there is a lot to choose from below there.  North West Arkansas and South west MO are also just as pretty and less developed. Rolling hills is an apt description for the Ozarks more than mountains.",t2_435968ef,EarnestHemingweed,0,1595967170.0,0,t1_fzjqspo,fzjqspo,False,untempered_schism,t3_hzldlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ozarks/comments/hzldlj/comparing_lakes_ozark_tv_filmed_georgia_lakes/,Comparing Lakes: Ozark TV filmed Georgia lakes (Lanier/Alatoona) VS.

"Almost all of our large lakes in this part of the country are also man-made, including the Lake of the Ozarks. You can definitely swim in them, but they are not clear (visibility at LotO is going to be 10 feet on a really good day, and maybe as little as 2 feet if it's rained recently or the lake has just turned over).

You are far from alone in wanting to move to the lake. I know several people in the market (Table Rock) and they have a price range similar to yours and are having a terrible time.
