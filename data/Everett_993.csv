"While this is tragic it is not national news worthy unfortunately.  It has nothing to do with fitting the narrative and you don't hear about everytime a cop kills a suspect.  What you do hear about is when a cop (who is supposed ro be well trained and maintain composure in stressful situations) overreacts and take a life of a suspect.  Far too many times suspects have been killed while running away or innocents have been killed because the cops engaged in a high speed chase over something trivial, or (once again supposedly well trained officers) got jumpy and took a life.  

Once again and let me make this perfectly clear, I am not saying that what happened in Everett today is less important or less tragic than if the reverse were to happen,  but I can fully understand why someone in Maine would not care about it.

"EVERETT — The Everett Housing Authority has purchased Huntington Park Apartments for $118 million from New York Life Investments.

The complex at 9009 W. Mall Drive in south Everett has 381 apartments and is within a mile of public transportation, grocery stores and schools. The housing authority bought the property to keep rent prices affordable for people earning as little as half of the area’s median income, said the agency’s executive director, Ashley Lommers-Johnson. It means a single person earning at least $40,500 annually, or a four-person household earning at least $57,850, can afford to live in the complex.",t2_3m7h1y3b,flowersbloomglitter,0,1648219958.0,0,t1_i22l6v0,i22l6v0,True,flowersbloomglitter,t3_tnnn7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/tnnn7p/everett_housing_authority_buys_381_apartments_its/,Everett Housing Authority buys 381 apartments — its biggest purchase yet | HeraldNet.com,/r/everett/comments/tnnn7p/everett_housing_authority_buys_381_apartments_its/i22l6v0/,9,r/everett,0,9

"Democratic state Rep. Emily Wicks of Everett announced Monday she will not seek re-election, saying it’s time to reset how she serves the community following three satisfying yet exhausting years as a lawmaker.

The departure of Wicks and Sells sets the stage for potentially competitive primaries in a district that encompasses Everett, Tulalip and a large part of Marysville.

It’s long been a Democrat stronghold. However, it may be less so this year after redistricting added a larger piece of Marysville with its Republican-leaning voters.

“I find the 38th has a history of bleeding blue and I don’t think Republicans have a chance at either of those seats,” said Paula Townsell, chair of the 38th Legislative District Democrats.

Doug Roulstone, chair of the Snohomish County Republican Party, is confident the GOP is well-positioned for success.

“We feel like the Democrats have handed this to us on a silver platter with redistricting, and the mandates and the policies they’ve passed,” he said. “We think there is a better than 50-50 chance that we will win all three seats.”

As of Monday, Democrats [Julio Cortes](https://electjuliocortes.com/) and [Mary Fosse ](https://www.maryfosse.com/)and Republican [Mark James](https://www.electmarkjames.com/) had launched campaigns to succeed Sells.

When the Broadway Alfy's reopens it should have space for such an event, but will likely only have a beer and wine license. You'd also need to organize something. The new Tapped Mukilteo or one of the area breweries such as Middleton, might have space for board games as well.

If you were looking for more traditional bar games like darts and pool along with stiff drinks and good food, there are several area bars which would meet that criteria.

"> The county’s new legislation removes prohibitions of detached ADUs (DADUs) on lots that aren’t at least five acres in the R-5 zone and 100,000 square feet in the RC zone.

I'm not feeling ambitious enough to go double-check the prior law, because it's tedious to find a specific provision in Snohomish County Code in the best of circumstances, and even worse if trying to find a previous revision.

However, I could have sworn the above is not new. I had looked it up when a big, new house was being added to a nearby property, and the existing house was being downgraded to an ADU to rent out. That example was over the 5 acre minimum, but I was fairly certain I had determined as a result of that research numerous other nearby properties smaller than 5 acres were eligible.

The rural ADU changes might be a moot concern in some areas anyways after the 2024 comprehensive plan update.

"Obligatory late to the party but I just wanted to say that u/Orillious is absolutely right! The restrictions on gay and bi men are outdated and need to be repealed. It’s important to understand the origin of these restrictions so that it’s clear why we don’t need them anymore. This started in the 80s when blood banks has limited abilities to test blood. To deal with this, the FDA banned donations from gay men since they had higher rates of HIV. The technology from screening blood today has vastly improved since the 80s and now the CDC has ensured that all donated blood is tested for HIV as well as syphilis, and the hepatitis B and C virus. Obviously, this means that there is absolutely no reason for continuing with these restrictions. In 2020, the pandemic-induced blood shortage forced the FDA to modify the restriction so that a man had to abstain from having sex with another man for 3 months before he was able to donate blood. If the FDA had removed all restrictions on gay and bi men, the blood supply would have increased and we wouldn’t be facing this national blood supply crisis. You can [check out this article for more info](https://www.everydayhealth.com/public-health/blood-shortage-crisis-in-the-us-has-experts-calling-for-revision-of-policy-for-gay-men/) on how changing these restrictions would affect blood supply.   
Since the start of this pandemic, blood donations have fallen by 10 percent. Also, a lot of blood drives were earlier held at schools which has now dropped by a whopping 62 percent. The American Red Cross released a statement that it now has less than a one-day supply of critical blood types. This has forced doctors to make difficult decisions about which patients can receive life-saving blood transfusions. People often think that the blood supply is adequate because they see statistics like almost 7 million people in the US donate blood every year. This may seem like a lot but it’s only 3 percent of all eligible people. Furthermore, it’s important to realize that less than 50% of the population is eligible for blood donation – it’s currently at 37%. Approximately 29,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the US and according to the American Red Cross, every 2 seconds, someone in the country requires blood or platelets. It’s not just accident victims who require blood, people with diseases such as sickle cell disease depend on blood transfusions to survive. Many people undergoing cancer treatment also need blood transfusions. Blood donation generally takes about 45 minutes to an hour and you can get complete a RapidPass online through your local Red Cross to speed up the process. If you have never donated blood before, you can [check out this link](https://www.hhs.gov/oidp/topics/blood-tissue-safety/donate-blood/index.html) to the Department of Health and Human Services which covers everything from requirements, what you should do before and after your blood donation, what to expect during your visit and links to online locators to help you find a blood donation center near you.",t2_368kz76u,heatheruff,0,1647256514.0,0,t1_i0lreh4,i0lreh4,True,LRAD,t3_sajadr,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/sajadr/the_american_red_cross_is_facing_a_national_blood/,The American Red Cross is facing a national blood supply crisis – it's our worst blood supply shortage in more than a decade.,/r/everett/comments/sajadr/the_american_red_cross_is_facing_a_national_blood/i0lreh4/,3,r/everett,0,3

"It seems like Trader Joe's is paying tax on both locations according to the county assessor's records.

To make things even more confusing, Safeway used to be located where the Big Lots is now, hence the telltale wavy roof design at that location. The current Trader Joe's location is legally platted on maps as ""Food Pavilion"" aka Thriftway (presumably the Bellingham-based chain which also owned Stock Market/Cost Cutter) due to the initial use when the property was developed.

With Kroger doing a sell and leaseback of many of its Fred Meyer locations, WinCo is left as the only area grocery chain which owns the land under most of its locations. Property tax records show it finally bought the property for the Edmonds location in 2020, which suggests it's doing very well as a location.",t2_es9c1,SEA_tide,0,1647187494.0,0,t1_i0i62ys,i0i62ys,False,2point8,t3_tcgq6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/tcgq6x/more_everett_mall_way_action_xpost_ridiotsincars/,More Everett Mall Way action (x-post r/IdiotsInCars),/r/everett/comments/tcgq6x/more_everett_mall_way_action_xpost_ridiotsincars/i0i62ys/,2,r/everett,0,2

"first. I've downvoted nobody in this comment feed, to get that out of the way.

I'm one of the people blaming serious drug issues for a lot of the problems, but victim blaming was not my intent. I'm simply saying - I can see how this is happening frequently in this area, as I've personally seen people very strung out, or potentially with serious mental illness, or both - placing themselves in very real danger... I barely avoided hitting a man who was stumbling down the sidewalk, then abruptly (without any indication he was about to, or even looking at the road at all) zig zagged his body into traffic, right in front of me. After I managed not hit him, continued to meander without a care in the world through 3 more lanes of traffic nearly causing multiple accidents.  These aren't even people ""trying to cross the street"" these are people who aren't even well enough to realize there IS a street...  


I've seen this same scene and similar play out dozens of times along that stretch of road. I think that's what most of the others are talking about as well.

Of course not every pedestrian related accident is due to this but, with it happening so frequently... its bound to cause accidents. and deaths. which is horribly sad. when I drive down that stretch of road I am always watching all the pedestrians like a hawk because there is a good chance one of them will not behave as expected, and I'm always worried one of them will just randomly step out in front of me without warning.",t2_3xtm7,snowpony,0,1646970391.0,0,t1_i075caf,i075caf,False,LRAD,t3_tb1j7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/tb1j7r/everett_police_shut_down_evergreen_way_again/,"Everett police shut down Evergreen Way again after another person hit, killed by car | KOMO",/r/everett/comments/tb1j7r/everett_police_shut_down_evergreen_way_again/i075caf/,3,r/everett,0,3

"road design helps if people are not so drugged up that they are completely unaware of their surroundings. this seems to be the biggest issue. the people i'm talking about are not bypassing safety for convenience, and trying to j-walk.. they are out of their minds wandering down the middle of a very busy street, giving absolutely zero f's about any of the vehicles around them.

"Welcome! Where are you moving from? I've been in and around Marysville a lot over the years and end up spending a lot of time there. It is quickly growing, especially in the unincorporated or newly annexed areas. Traffic can be bad if trying to commute to Everett or if one is unaware of some side streets.

Overall, Marysville is a very working class city even more so than Everett. A lot of the social life is centered around the Quil Ceda Creek and Tulalip casinos, the latter attracting a younger crowd. Cristiano's is a popular pizza and pasta restaurant that has reasonable prices. It used to have the top Golden Corral in the US, but the franchisee sold the business and the new owner wasn't able to keep the franchise agreement. There's a great taco truck on the Reservation (Tacos El Rey, which is not the truck near the freeway, but is the one about a quarter mile past the roundabout).

Typically people will either drive to SeaTac airport and park in an off-airport lot or get someone to drop them off at the Tulalip Casino to take the Bellair Airporter. The casino used to allow free parking up to two weeks for Bellair passengers, but I think that ended. Shuttle Express doesn't have the state's franchise/regulated rates for airport transportation north of the Snohomish River, so rates are even higher.

Nearby, Arlington is about 50/50 in terms of being suburban or rural. Granite Falls has a reputation for being very rural and low income (the new homes there contradict this) and Stanwood/Camano Island feels a lot more remote than it is. A lot of people forget, but there is some housing on and around the Reservation as well.

I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the area.

">What many don't know, is the slow down isn't really from the ports, but from the trucks and rail used to ship the containers out.

Yes and no.   There are many factors that create bottle necks in the supply chain.  At the high level,  Supply Chains need to work in a predictable rhythm, or they can quickly overload a step in the process. 

What started the snow ball was obviously Covid. As the US economy adapted and was stimulated with cash to consumers and business, demand for goods soared. 

The Supply began to struggle when there was a sudden shortage of physical containers in China to ship goods to the US. Essentially,  more shipping companies routed their boats to run the China to US deliveries, because of the demand,  which changed the balance of how much supply could be on the water at any given time.  It's like drag racing between red lights, you get there quick,  but you're still going to wait for the green light.  

With the influx of more containers hitting the US, the inland infrastructure struggled to keep up.  Trucks, rail, 3PL warehouses, ect.  We couldn't move the containers fast enough,  which caused its own rippling effect.  Train yards in Chicago overloaded with containers, could not schedule more to come from LA/Long Beach, which meant their yards filled,  which meant boats sat in the water,  which means port congestion, which means containers not going back to China in a normal time line,  which means a shortage of containers in China,  which means Supply delays, which means companies buy more stock to cover the lead time,  which means more container demand,  which means rinse and repeat everything above.  

Sorry for the long rant,  but there has never been a Supply Chain storm like this ever, and for those who are in it, trying to calculate every possible impact,  cost,  delay, ect.... it's been wildly impossible at times given all the factors that create rippling impacts weeks later on the other side of the world.",t2_5rj4cg8t,FrontButtPunt,0,1646661194.0,0,t1_hzpbjib,hzpbjib,False,chattytrout,t3_t8h85l,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/t8h85l/port_of_everett_terminal_waiting_for_a_ship/,Port of Everett Terminal Waiting for a Ship,/r/everett/comments/t8h85l/port_of_everett_terminal_waiting_for_a_ship/hzpbjib/,4,r/everett,0,4

Peterson was trying to smoke drugs, according to trial testimony.

Meza told him to stop, thinking it could trigger a seizure. He testified this conversation went “not as planned.” He also claimed Peterson threatened to put him “to sleep.” Peterson did not threaten to use a weapon, Meza said in a police interview after the shooting.

Peterson punched him in the face, surveillance video showed. That footage was shown to jurors many times throughout the trial.

A fight ensued in the aisle.

Meza landed several blows. Peterson grabbed the other man’s hood. That blocked Meza’s vision.

The defendant felt a hand on his waist where he kept his gun. He thought it was Peterson’s hand. The security footage showed it was the hand of Peterson’s friend reaching in.

Within seconds, Meza racked the slide of his pistol and fired a shot into Peterson’s stomach. He told police the first shot was an accident.

The first 9 mm bullet sent Peterson to his knees, with his back to Meza. The defendant fired another shot down into Peterson’s back and through his right lung and liver. That bullet was intentional, Meza reportedly told police.

After the shooting, Meza could be seen on security video taking the magazine out of his gun and putting his hands in the air.

Meza said he was in fear for his life the whole time. Prosecutors argued Meza had no reason to be in fear after the first shot, but he fired a second one anyway.

Sturdivant called it a “senseless killing.”

“It’s as simple as this, ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Meza brought a gun to a fistfight,” he told the jury, adding later, “Nobody is saying Mr. Meza is a cold-blooded killer … What we’re saying is his decision to kill a man is unreasonable.”

The defense attorney, Leary, argued: “He doesn’t have to wait for Peterson to successfully further escalate the situation. He is entitled to act on appearances provided that he’s acting in good faith and on reasonable grounds.”

After a weeklong trial in front of Superior Court Judge Richard Okrent, eight men and four women convicted Meza of the lesser charge.

The jury made a special finding that Meza committed the crime while armed with a firearm. The sentence enhancement will tack on a mandatory five years to Meza’s prison time, Sturdivant said.",t2_343fh,LRAD,0,1646508493.0,0,t1_hzhif9e,hzhif9e,False,LRAD,t3_t7348r,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/t7348r/mistrial_declared_in_deadly_everett_bus_shooting/,Mistrial declared in deadly Everett bus shooting over prosecutor ‘errors’,/r/everett/comments/t7348r/mistrial_declared_in_deadly_everett_bus_shooting/hzhif9e/,2,r/everett,0,2

>The Lokey Group is responsible for redeveloping the nearly 100-year-old former lumber company office and showroom. It would operate the building as the tenant, and the Port of Everett would still own it.

That second paragraph I quoted says ""the port estimates paying up to $1 million"" but then the third paragraph says ""The Lokey Group is responsible for redeveloping…"" so which is it? Hmm.

edit: Looking at the least pdf linked above, it is clear that **the port** expects to spend ""up to a $1 million"" just to get the building *ready* for the tenant to take over.

"I like how it's not an alliterative mascot name. Too many schools take the easy way out and choose something which starts with the same letter as the school's name.

I kinda like the idea of Kamiak's mascot being a ferry, but the really common knight mascot was chosen instead. The school colors being purple, silver, and white are also more unique in the area.

My college went a step further and chose a nickname which was unique and eventually got a mascot which has little to do with that nickname except both being remotely related to football.",t2_es9c1,SEA_tide,0,1645996519.0,0,t1_hyozh7f,hyozh7f,True,Rbmui13,t3_t2u7js,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/t2u7js/award_for_the_most_embarrassing_least/,"Award for the most embarrassing, least inspirational school mascot goes to Everett High School!",/r/everett/comments/t2u7js/award_for_the_most_embarrassing_least/hyozh7f/,4,r/everett,0,4

"Everett High alumni of ‘08 here. What I learned about our mascot, towards the end of my days there, is that the reason it’s a seagull. Back in the 40’s or 50’s (I think), they choose Sammy the Seagull to bring luck to games. They had a superstition, that whenever they saw a seagull fly over a field before a game, they had a better chance at winning the game. Even though seagulls are a plenty in Everett, but why not bring that luck everywhere you go? 

They did try and change the mascot around ‘07 or ‘08, can’t remember, and that was the story they gave. And the mascot still stands as, Sammy the Seagull.

The main library, 2702 Hoyt Ave., is set to be open again on Sundays; its hours will be 1-5 p.m. Both the main library and the Evergreen Branch, 9512 Evergreen Way, plan to extend their evening hours until 8 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
“We’re kind of doing a soft launch of it,” said library director Abigail Cooley. “We’re trying to work our way backwards to pre-pandemic hours.”
The COVID-19 pandemic created an economic crunch that resulted in budget cuts for many city services, including libraries.
Public libraries across the state closed in March 2020 for public health reasons.

"I don't have a specific recommendation and your situation could call for something different, but don't overlook people who aren't CPAs and just do taxes.  It's worth a search.

It obviously depends on the CPA but tax pros often have more training and experience specifically with tax issues.  Actually, sometimes the CPAs even farm out the work to them - especially if the CPA doesn't want to bother getting the 'enrolled agent' certification from the IRS.

They usually cost less, too.

"I recently bought. And sold! Market was definitely crazy. 

We sold our house in south Everett that we have been in since 2005. So definitely saw it tank and were underwater for years after the ‘08 crash and before surging up the last few years. 

The only way we could afford to buy was by virtue of making a stupid profit on the sale. We had to have a little more room after having kids, so that was the motivation. 

I can also say that just before Covid when we first considered selling we had our agent come through and give us a list of things we should do to the place before putting on the market. We did some of them. When the same agent came through again recently, it was a totally different story. Basically, you don’t need to do anything. Sellers are 100% in control and someone will buy it no matter what. They did, for 15% over asking price and they waived inspection too. Totally insane.

Thankfully we lucked out and did not get into a bidding war when we turned around and bought, but that felt super luck of the draw getting something where the sellers had just lowered their asking price.

I think things will slow down from where they are now, but they’ll still continue upward - definitely so in Everett. You’ve got the Waterfront Place and Riverfront developments underway, bringing more shopping, dining, entertainment, etc. I.e., more stuff to draw in new people and raise prices. Downtown is better than it’s been in years and feels like it keeps improving.

"The price pressure in Everett is unlikely to change in the near or medium term. The only potential for it to decrease is a global economic catastrophe or a shocking decision by Amazon to abandon Seattle entirely.

As long as Amazon continues to pump lots of sign on bonus and stock options in to new hires and retention in Seattle, the value of real estate anywhere on the I5/I90 corridor will continue to grow.

Furthermore, the opening of the railroad in Everett in the 2030s, with Lynnwood opening in the mid 2020s is going to even more tightly integrate the Everett market with the Seattle market.

So to summarize:

Everett real estate driven by the knock on effects of people moving out of Seattle, or moving into the area and not being able to afford to live in Seattle. The engine of that growth is Amazon.

Desirability of Everett will continue to go up, combining a great airport option with fast rail transport.

"We just bought a house in Port Gardener that was built in 1904. We are remodeling/cleaning the place up and there is a basement that looks like you'd find some bodies hidden in it. There are also two old garage type buildings that are super disgusting and sketchy looking that we'll be tearing down. It has knob and tube wiring, which we've had to replace. The heating isn't central, the toilet has been recalled, and the water heater was almost as old as me. The pipes are iffy, so we're cleaning up the plumbing too. We also just discovered a raccoon has been trying to move in before us and did $2,400 in damage under the house. That probably happened because the previous owners let the place get completely overgrown, so we have to do a lot of work to the yard, including cleaning out a seat that came out of a vehicle and somehow ended up in the yard. 

We do love the location and are happy with the price we paid, especially compared to the Eastside and Seattle. We found that we had to do the work ourselves or pay $1,000,000+ for a place that is completely renovated. 

When I say ""do the work"", I don't mean actually do it yourself, but it is really hard to have it done if you can't afford to live elsewhere for months while you hire people to fix everything. Plus, just tracking down people to do the work is a lot harder than we expected. And then you get the plumber out for one thing, but then need to bring the electrician back to finish the wiring, or can't put in the floors in until the painting is done, and so forth. Coordinating it all has been really time consuming. 

We found Port Gardener and Bayside doable, but the Northwest neighborhood is so expensive and competitive and will probably only get worse as they develop the waterfront, grow EVCC, and bring the light rail up here. It seems like the other neighborhoods in Everett will also continue to get more expensive as people move further north, because people can no longer afford  to purchase in Seattle or the Eastside.",t2_hlniivci,Upbeat-Mess-9952,0,1645085249.0,0,t1_hxa8gdc,hxa8gdc,True,erollic,t3_su3hk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/su3hk2/home_buying_in_everett/,Home Buying in Everett,/r/everett/comments/su3hk2/home_buying_in_everett/hxa8gdc/,3,r/everett,0,3

"All the chips on the PCB in the ECU are soldered in place. How else would they be attached? I'd say soldering is generally not used to join 2 wires in commercially produced machines of any kind because it's easier and more reliable to simply use a wire of the correct length in the first place. Solder is almost exclusively used to attach stuff to boards, it's really only hobbyist grade projects that are joining 2 wires with solder.

"I was looking to buy a house in Everett last year until I settled on a different nearby city. 

If you're buying now, expect at least 450k for a 3 bedroom (which is like the smallest size you'll find).  Houses in Everett are old as hell and people have done weird shit in them sometimes.  Like one my friend saw had 2 kitchens.  Other one I saw had no dishwasher area at all it was so old.  The longer the house has been around, the more creative ideas the owners have for improvement projects.  Supply was also really low.  Don't know if that's changed in a year. 

The prices are going to go up for the foreseeable future.  As long as there continues to be a lot of liquidity in the monetary system, housing is going to be heavily invested in because it's seen as one of the safest investments.  The reforms after 2008 have made it so the housing market will likely be the last domino to fall in an economic recession.",t2_i9i9sktz,yangwenli99,0,1645040293.0,0,t1_hx7nish,hx7nish,True,erollic,t3_su3hk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/su3hk2/home_buying_in_everett/,Home Buying in Everett,/r/everett/comments/su3hk2/home_buying_in_everett/hx7nish/,8,r/everett,0,8
"Short answer: It sucks for homebuyers.

Unfortunately, we haven't built much at all in the close-in areas over the past 10 years. In my immediate neighborhood (the Longfellow part of Port Gardner) I can count on one hand how many new housing units of any kind have been added. As a result, prices have gone absolutely bonkers. I paid $225,000 for my home in 2011. Nearby homes that are smaller than mine are now selling for over $600,000.

Unless we start building a lot more homes, unfortunately I only see this situation getting worse in the near to medium term. Increasing mortgage rates (the 30-year is [currently up to 4.1%](https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/mortgage-rates/mnd)—it was 2.8% a year ago!) may put some downward pressure on home prices, but as long as people keep moving here and demand for housing keeps going up without a corresponding increase in housing supply, prices are going to be stupidly high.",t2_1c4bb,TheTim,0,1645040183.0,0,t1_hx7n8bu,hx7n8bu,True,erollic,t3_su3hk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/su3hk2/home_buying_in_everett/,Home Buying in Everett,/r/everett/comments/su3hk2/home_buying_in_everett/hx7n8bu/,12,r/everett,0,12

I have a house in the area and would want to sell it before moving to the new house but that’s fairly impossible if you want anything “hot” up here.

"Yeah that’s probably a good option too if you wanted to avoid that one hill by the Safeway/salon. It seems like federal way has a nice view of the cascades on a clear day. Those streets going east before 35th can be kinda steep, so that’s why I’ve mostly avoided biking them. Everett really just has random steep hills for whatever reason lol.",t2_94y8g7sj,ping439,0,1644988228.0,0,t1_hx4xjv1,hx4xjv1,False,snarkaplump,t3_staszt,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/staszt/is_mukilteo_blvd_safe_for_bike_commuting/,Is Mukilteo Blvd safe for bike commuting?,/r/everett/comments/staszt/is_mukilteo_blvd_safe_for_bike_commuting/hx4xjv1/,2,r/everett,0,2
"If only slightly because there’s more than one lane in each direction at least on Everergreen and there’s a better sight line than Mukilteo Blvd. Generally, if I’m heading north in that area walking or biking I head up Hoyt and the merge onto Rucker by the YMCA and the cross over to Flemming once I hit 52nd street. Maybe not the most direct route, but if cars are the issue like they are for me, that’s best one. Really wish there was some way to connect the roads south of forest park and west of evergreen before you’d hit Pecks. It seems like pigeon creek gets in the way, I’m fairly new to Everett, but would love to see that area become more accessible to bikers/pedestrians (not cars) somehow.",t2_94y8g7sj,ping439,0,1644987705.0,0,t1_hx4wme9,hx4wme9,False,snarkaplump,t3_staszt,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/staszt/is_mukilteo_blvd_safe_for_bike_commuting/,Is Mukilteo Blvd safe for bike commuting?,/r/everett/comments/staszt/is_mukilteo_blvd_safe_for_bike_commuting/hx4wme9/,2,r/everett,0,2
