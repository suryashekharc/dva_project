"I would never consider killing them, but since they all live in one enclosed space, it would not be difficult, theoretically, to find one dead.

I have been in contact with Crocker Snow Jr. and a few of his professional contacts for months, attempting to track down a skull; he has simply never taken the time to collect any vole specimens, though he does still travel out to his beach house with family and colleagues quite often, and all of the skulls and skins from animals trapped and killed by scientists were donated to museums. Since none remain in private collections, this explains the lack of photos outside of publicly inaccessible databases. There is also only one photo of a live beach vole online!

Only part of the island is privately owned, the western half is owned by the government of Nantucket, so if a third party did go there they would have to stick to that side - and I would definitely attempt to find a way onto the island outside of the seals’ breeding season, not only to leave them alone, but also to avoid getting attacked by one! 

Thanks for your advice and concerns, but I have already considered nearly every obstacle I might run into in this search.",t2_3nsrbf1b,qdotbones,0,1634869257.0,0,t1_hhkkq2p,hhkkq2p,False,[deleted],t3_qd6q53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nantucket/comments/qd6q53/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Nantucket/comments/qd6q53/deleted_by_user/hhkkq2p/,9,r/Nantucket,0,9
"My understanding is that Muskeget is currently closed to the public. It is privately owned and not open. I believe you would need special permission from the owners (the Snow family). Also, since the vole is quite rare, I do not know if killing them is currently legal. You might consider checking with local biology and conservation groups including the University of Massachusetts Field Station on Nantucket, the Conservation Foundation, or a similar group. 

Additionally, during most of the year, the island is illegal to access due to the Commonwealth's laws on the molestation of seals, since it is overrun by them.",t2_5g7e06uw,AloysiusGrimes,0,1634868636.0,0,t1_hhkjez4,hhkjez4,True,[deleted],t3_qd6q53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nantucket/comments/qd6q53/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Nantucket/comments/qd6q53/deleted_by_user/hhkjez4/,5,r/Nantucket,0,5

Have you ever been to Nantucket or were you just running your mouth? Because no one who owns property in Nantucket would ever upvote you for saying use a bike. It’s mostly cobblestone which is horrible to ride a bike on and the only people that ride bikes are day trippers or people that bring bikes solely to get on the fast ferry before everyone else. It’s also SUPER annoying to drive around town with a bunch of 30-50yr olds riding around who barely know how to ride a bike being in your way.

Unfortunately this is going to be the case in any predominantly tourist economy community. I would say Nantucket and others like it are relatively special as a large number of their community members are technically non stakeholders. They only summer there or perhaps they have a seasonal business. It’s obvious they have some influence and importance but how much should that dictate. And how much should one weigh the opinion of a native resident? What about a two generations native? Three? In broader society native borns get no additional input wherever they are.

"I agree that you don't *need* a car, but if you do rent one there are some cool things you can do...

Whenever we go in the shoulder season, we always check in with Affordable Rentals to see what they have for deals.  If you can get a Jeep / 4x4, you can go up to Great Point and drive on the beach up to the lighthouse.  You can pack some snacks/drinks and pull off and have a little picnic next to the water.  Its a very nice / fun drive if that's something that would interest your family.

A car also makes it much easier to explore other parts of the island, which we have found to be a lot of fun.

Hope you enjoy the trip either way.

"There have been numerous investigations for several years. It is currently, I believe, with the Cape and Islands District Attorney's Office. 

There is also a civil—*not* criminal, note—suit pending before district court that names an alleged perpetrator, a 2014 graduate of Nantucket High School. 

There are, additionally, rumors swirling that one perpetrator was the child of a prominent town official and a member of the police department (I won't be more specific, for obvious reasons). A relative of that family later pleaded guilty to making false statements to police. 

It is, of course, very possible that the police simply did not solve the case because there was no particularly hard evidence, and the rumors are unfounded—or could be founded, but no evidence could be then found to confirm them. It is also possible there was some form of cover-up.

Consider getting into Hyannis a day before hopping on the Nantucket ferry. My wife and I broke up the whole trip with a night at the Hyannis Comfort Inn which was very comfortable and affordable.  We hung out at Hyannis that night for a good dinner an listened to a free outdoor concert. All just a short easy walk from the Inn. Parking was free for the night and the Inn served a filling continental breakfast.  We strolled around Hyannis Main Street in the morning and visited a JFK museum before heading to Nantucket on the ferry mid day.

"It's a great time to visit. Most restaurants are still open—you might struggle a bit more with ultra-seasonal things like ice cream stands, but at your ages I imagine that's less of an issue—and the museums and other major activities will be, too (brewery, etc). It's a bit past peak beach season, but the nature trails/walks are, I think, at their prettiest that time of year. The Squam Swamp/Squam Farm area, the middle moors (including Norfolk Farm and Stump Pond), Masquetuck, Tupancy Links, and the Sanford Farm/Head of the Plains trails should all be stunning at that season, and less buggy than in parts of the summer. 

Just make sure you book lodging early! Supposedly it's filling up later and later into the season.

I’d say that if you were single, didn’t know anyone, and didn’t have a hobby…the winter would be hard for you here. But as someone with family, a partner, and a flexible year round and seasonal job — it’s perfect.

"Last year's summer on the Cape and Islands was… not as bad as people thought it would be (largely because a lot of people came to second homes to WFH). 

The economy on Nantucket has a ton of small businesses and nonprofits—e.g., conservation groups do a lot, historical groups, etc—and the largest private employer is the hospital. The town government also employs hundreds of people for the usual things: Teachers/school staff, sewer workers, sanitation, etc. There're pretty typical businesses like restaurants (a couple dozen stay open year round and many more for at least half the year, rather than just a few months) and bars, a car dealership, etc. 

Taxes: Yeah, I've heard varying figures for the share of town revenue paid by ""non-voting taxpayers"" (official-speak for ""people who have second homes""), but they go as high as 90 percent of the revenue. The town budget is actually shockingly large—including education, it's over $100 million most years for a community of \~15-20k, year round. That said, the actual house-to-house property taxes aren't *dreadful*, though I'm not sure if they're higher on second homes. It's certainly not as high as some of the rates you'd find in some suburbs of major cities, e.g., in northern New Jersey/Fairfield County/Westchester or something like that.",t2_5g7e06uw,AloysiusGrimes,0,1625017964.0,0,t1_h3igbbt,h3igbbt,False,[deleted],t3_oalyqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nantucket/comments/oalyqj/what_is_life_like_on_nantucket/,What is life like on Nantucket?,/r/Nantucket/comments/oalyqj/what_is_life_like_on_nantucket/h3igbbt/,6,r/Nantucket,0,6

"Ah gotcha. I assume the wealthy pay a ton of taxes? Property taxes must not be cheap. Hopefully that can go towards some affordable housing.

"The year-round community is very middle-class, but the summer tourists tend to be quite wealthy, yes. 

Affordable housing is a really hot-button issue locally. Everyone agrees it's a problem, but solutions are more challenging. The local government is putting about $20 million a year (last I checked) into buying up affordable housing stock. An uninsulated 3-room shack is on the market for $1.8 million right now. 

So yeah, it's a problem. Some of the older island families are able to give land to their kids (the Bartletts, who own largest of the local farms, have basically a compound, for instance), but mostly it's very hard for folks to get housing full-time, and you regularly hear stories—particularly of young seasonal workers and folks in the immigrant community—living in incredibly cramped conditions, e.g., many families to a house or something.",t2_5g7e06uw,AloysiusGrimes,0,1625017374.0,0,t1_h3if60a,h3if60a,False,[deleted],t3_oalyqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nantucket/comments/oalyqj/what_is_life_like_on_nantucket/,What is life like on Nantucket?,/r/Nantucket/comments/oalyqj/what_is_life_like_on_nantucket/h3if60a/,7,r/Nantucket,0,7
"Well, I can answer a bit here. 

It's pretty normal, tbh, in a lot of ways. Yeah, you have to take a boat to go to any other town (and the high school spends bananas amounts on its athletic transportation budget), but functionally, imagine living in a decent-sized town. Grocery stores, museums, bars, restaurants, library, the usual. 

Going to high school here? Pretty normal. Graduating classes are in the 100-150 range, so you will know basically every name but there are definitely gonna be kids you don't see much. It's a very, very diverse high school—minority-majority school district, and about 30 percent English language learners. (Nantucket's current minority population is mostly from Central America, Jamaica, and a few other places, but it's been diverse for a long time and has a long history with Black activism (Frederick Douglass's first public speech was on the island!) and its Cape Verdean community is historically quite significant.) It's also a very sports-oriented school, since \~2/3rds of students play at least one sport. 

People are born and raised here, and people move here—like anywhere else! 

In the summer, the island basically becomes a small city. It's very hectic, very crowded, a bunch more restaurants/bars/shops open up, and the airport becomes one of the busiest in New England. The wealthy crowd comes then. Off-season, it's a standard middle-class community with a few island-related quirks (like when the ferries shut down for a few days when it gets stormy). There are a ton of nonprofit organizations that employ a lot of people in the professional class—as do businesses—and a lot of focus on the trades (carpentry, construction, etc), which is both due to the constant building of summer homes and because the island's homes take a lot of wear and tear due to the sea weather.

"Honestly the only way you're getting lodging on Nantucket at this point is if your holiday can be rescheduled on a moment's notice for whenever something opens up due to cancellation.  OR if you wait until after (American) Labor Day.  The larger of my two rental houses was already booked solid back in March.  In terms of weather the island cools off very quickly by the last week of August, but it's still a beautiful destination well worth the visit in early Autumn.
If you had your heart set on Summer, you should look into rentals on the South Shore or Southcoast.

"LOTS of remarkable dinner spots — and, yeah, many of them indeed crazy expensive. A few favorites that are (slightly) more reasonable:

Slip14 for chowder, incredible calamari, excellent fish, all served on one of ACK’s most adorable wharves.

Pi Pizzeria has a mediocre mid-island location and INCREDIBLE Italian comfort food — excellent pastas, parm, pizza, and a surprisingly diverse and well priced wine list.

SeaGrille is a local fave (in part because it stays open all year) with terrific oysters, clams, shrimp, and a chorizo-crusted cod that I order basically every time. Reasonably priced by Nantucket standards, which admittedly isn’t saying much.

Keepers is the new(ish) joint from the Fog Island Diner family. A strong burger, great guac, and unbelievably good smoked chicken wings. Their location a little off beaten path, but outdoor dining on front patio is very pleasant.

Sandbar at Jetties is literally on beach, with great bar and live acoustic music, plus oysters and fried clams, burgers and wings, reasonably good seafood. You’re coming for drinks and view and scene, but food is… good.

Saltbox has a wonky location near Nantucket’s little airport (sensing a theme here? more casual and reasonable joints are all mid-island) but there front yard is adorable, believe they’re doing live music again this Summer, and food is actually quite good. Terrific spot with kids, who can relax outdoors and are basically eating at a picnic table.

Drive or Wave (our public Transpo) out to Millie’s in Madaket for a Sunset, margherita, and great fish taco.

Poster above mentioned Summer House. Look, we’re fans. But it’s as far from town as it’s possible to get… and I worry you’ll ultimately find it VERY pricey. Especially for what it is. We go a couple times per season, but if you’re springing for this kind of fine dining, would suggest Straight Wharf, Languedoc, or even Chanticleer if you’re up for the Sconset trip.

"Those (most) of us with ebikes have been extremely careful about staying under the radar, lest the county should decide to get involved regarding regulation. This means being extremely cautious and courteous on the bike paths (wide berth, alerting others when overtaking, staying off the throttle if so equipped, maintaining reasonable speed etc), obeying signage prohibiting motorized vehicles, being really considerate if on the beach, and blending in with traffic as much as possible when on roadways. There is no enforced licensing/regulation as of yet. I really hope it stays that way.

There are fantastic rides to be had on ebikes around the island, but if we aren't careful too many other user groups (pedestrians, dog walkers, joggers, little kids on bikes/trikes) will begin to complain.

Richard Haliburton, with his Princeton background, movie stars looks, and mysterious death is ""maybe"" who Indians Jone's is based on. He used to tackle his writer's block in Siasconset. Way back when.

**Richard Halliburton (January 9, 1900 – presumed dead after March 24, 1939) was an American travel writer, adventurer, and author who is best known today for having swum the length of the Panama Canal and paying the lowest toll in its history—36 cents in 1928.\[1\] His final and fatal adventure, an attempt to sail the Chinese junk Sea Dragon across the Pacific Ocean – from Hong Kong to the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, California – made him legendary.**

"Sounds like to me when reading this, is the problem isn't that the Steamship Authority won't hire black owned businesses but instead when contracts are put out to bid, they are not getting any bids from black owned businesses. It also sounds like some of the contracts are for very specialized work that there simply are not many companies that do that work to begin with.

So the issue appears to be more about how can the Steamship Authority expand its contract process to encourage black owned businesses to bid, rather than some sort of racist agenda by the Steamship Authority as the title of the article might imply.

What is unclear to me in the article is it seems to concentrate on more specialized contracts such as ship repair that are Coast Guard regulated.
