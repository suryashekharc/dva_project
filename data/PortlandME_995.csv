"> Also internal NSA documents from the Snowden leak showed how they struggle with tracking users on Tor

The memo you are referring to literally says they are in favor of Tor remaining active because ""a critical mass of targets use Tor and scaring them off might be counterproductive.""

I began writing about Tor after the CIA's Snowden began to promote them in 2013, so yeah I'm aware of the memo but maybe you should go read it before using it in arguments. (It's called Tor Stinks and I'm sure you can find it.) The memo literally says Tor makes their job easier. But you're also talking about a ""leak"" from an amoral Ron Paul supporter who happily went to work for the CIA and maybe you shouldn't base your reality around what people like that tell you.

.

To clarify I was not implying that the USG wants to help child abusers share images and videos of abuse. I'm saying they need the traffic to hide in and thus allow it - to some extent. While they're doing that they're free to arrest anyone they can find. But they have to be aware that too much success in this area would probably cause that needed civilian traffic to dry up. I did provide an embedded link on my comment that directs you to a site that updates ""dark web"" arrests. I've found over the years that if actually read these articles (at least ones in MSM) they seldom if ever mention Tor. Which was the only point I was trying to make.

The only people who want Tor are black marketers, pedophiles, paranoids who hero-worship CIA Nazis like Snowden, and of course the CIA itself.

">He was probably using the US Pentagon's Tor Project, which is meant to hide your IP address from websites you visit by mixing it in with other traffic on the Tor network. I call it the Pentagon's project because it is. The Navy invented Tor, but they realized they need ""civilian"" traffic on the network to hide in. So they turned Tor over to EFF (corporate lobby group for tech billionaires) who began marketing Tor as a way to evade the government that invented and still funds it to this day.

>To make sure the CIA has enough traffic to hide in as they commit their crimes against humanity, the USG willfully allows child porn and other criminal activities to take place every day on their network.

"One of my favorite moments as an Uber driver took place in that parking lot. I picked up a fare in Cape Elizabeth and 4 guys my age come out, one of them had big bandage around his leg. It turns out they were from Long Island and were up here for a bachelor party, the bachelor had managed to trip and slash his leg open on a sharp coffee table corner. After I made sure the injured guy didn’t need an ambulance and wouldn’t bleed all over my car, I took them across the bridge to Mercy. We were chit-chatting and found out we were all musicians and in fact we played the same niche genre of ska. We knew a lot of the same musicians and had played a lot of the same venues over the years. We had pulled into the emergency lot just after 11pm and I decided this would be my last fare for the night. The best man had snuck a couple of 4-packs of Bissell Brother’s Substance under his coat and I was all to eager to take one off his hands after a long day of driving people around. We stayed in that lot and chatted until 3 in the morning until I decided I needed sleep and the bachelor should get his stitches.",t2_1cqy9txz,SaabTurb0,0,1648233854.0,0,t1_i23kq20,i23kq20,True,soulbarn,t3_tnpe48,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/tnpe48/in_case_you_missed_it_the_emergency_entrance_at/,"In case you missed it, the emergency entrance at old Mercy Hospital was demo’ed yesterday.

"In the scheme of things, Portland actually fared better than many other American cities. Newburgh, NY immediately comes to mind as place that got completely wrecked, losing like 1/3 of its downtown built environment (everything along the Hudson).

I’ll say this much though… you gotta wonder what stuff is going on today that later generations are gonna think was really dumb. My thought is that we’re gonna view the “modernization” and partial destruction of the Portland Co. Complex as well as the B&M as abominations.

"“Affordable housing.” OMG, you such a kidder! 

Actually, some affordable housing is planned, according to a December MaineBiz article:

The building will include  “165 market-rate apartments, commercial retail space and self-storage units. The 3.5-acre campus also will feature two new buildings next to the main hospital building. They are slated for roughly 95 affordable housing units developed by nonprofit partners Community Housing of Maine and the Portland Housing Authority.

I feel like the people that are opposed to the food trucks in the area are curmudgeons that dont 
 like fun and complain about too many poor and ethnic people are congregating near their million dollar condos. 
In a city that is know for its food why bother stifling a up and coming food scene. The food trucks today are the next James beard nominees. Take Mr. Tuna for example because of the food trucks and the stall at the market they are blowing up and now have two brick and mortar spots. As far as restaurants in the area complaining, it breeds competition and drives up the quality of food; most likely the places complaining are not very good. The food trucks bring foot traffic which will pay out later down the line when people ask where to go to eat they will think “oh let’s try that cute bistro that we walked by up by the food trucks”, or “let’s get a beer and app at the front room before we head to the prom for some tacos”.

"I ran a food truck in Portland and the city is less than accommodating… or at least… it was when they first approved food trucks. Firstly, they didn’t designate nor issue permits for any permanent parking location. This resulted in having to pay meters to remain in a location, and also having to move locations every two hours when the meter expired… often we would just move ahead one spot and back every two hours for no real logical reason. We got ticketed, often. I’m assuming since they are on the hill that the City has finally designated this area to them… which is great! I agree that the City should be providing assistance with disposal services since, after all, they pay for licensing as well as taxes in the City. In my opinion, they should designate the upper parking lot area to these trucks and add a large disposal unit to help with this. As far as those living on the hill (as I also did at one time) and complaining about the view and obstruction… I would like to remind them of what made Portland attractive to live in in the first place: a bustling food & art community with young entrepreneurs… many of whom, not by choice, have their backs to the wall trying to keep a business going while also no longer being able to afford rent in areas such as the hill or in Portland in general.

">Cutting coke with fent is weird and stupid.

Of course it is. I don't think anybody does it as a smart business decision. It's a mistake that happens when producers/distributors don't thoroughly clean their tables.

Even reputable people can have a dumb mistake happen somewhere in the supply chain of an unregulated industry, so for me, it isn't worth the payoff.

"I love the Portland vintage shops and think they are great for a curated vintage shopping experience. If you want to go further afield, Orphan Annie's in Auburn is a gem, and they have a sale every Monday in their warehouse from 10-1 which is an adventure in digging. 

Heirloom Vintage in Waterville is another great spot.

I'd also recommend driving down Route 1, there are lots of antique shops and thrift stores along the stretch between Arundel and Kittery, including a flea market next to Arundel Antiques. They are busiest on summer weekends but there's usually at least one person set up there unless the weather is terrible.

If you want to go further out, Todd's Farm flea market in Rowley, Mass starts at the beginning of April. If you really want to go for it, make a trip to the Brimfield Antique Show which runs the week of May 10. It's the largest outdoor antique show in the world and just walking through it is an incredible experience. It's about 2.5 hours away and definitely worth the drive.

"I've never seen anyone be such a bully and victim at the same time. 

It doesn't matter whether she wrote the proposal or not. There's no merit behind the claim that executive mayors are better for Black people. The cities with the highest income disparities are all executive mayor led. The most brutal police murders over the past decade have occurred in executive mayor led Minneapolis, New York City, Baltimore. Flint Michigan's city finances were ran into the ground by their elected mayor, leading to their water crisis. To say that executive mayor specifically means better outcomes for people of color is flat out wrong. 

Dressing up her own proposal as the only one another Black commissioner could support is manipulative. She throws her identity around in ways that don't make sense, and then lashes out with accusations of ""racism"" and ""islamophobia"" at anyone who dares to question her.

"Here are some things i can think to add: 

Portland is close to 1/3 the size of providence population-wise, portland is much closer to hiking/mountains, portland has a great restaurant/brewery scene but I imagine providence has more variety given the larger scale, portland is only a 2 hour drive to Boston (or 2.5 w/ Amtrak) but providence is much closer and convenient for getting to Boston/Cape/NYC. 

Portland has a serious limitation on available housing, the cost has skyrocketed accordingly,  and overall cost of living is pretty comparable to Boston. 

The greater portland area is fine if you’re looking for a quieter existence and the overall infrastructure in this part of the state is 100% car dependent vs the greater Boston/providence area

I grew up in Portland and boomeranged back for work so I can’t speak about the experience of transplants who are looking to make friends, but I bet that’s easier in Providence for new residents just based on size and the different activities available.

If I had to pick between the two I’d pick portland, but I’m extremely biased.

I think the Deering Grange would probably also be about the same price, but its a little bit harder to get into contact with them.

The south portland community center on near the highschool in non-covid times has a small conference room that I've seen used for meet ups and stuff. I don't think they've lifted their covid restrictions yet though.

"“boomer-brained” were specifically chosen words lol. 

Anyway, Rose Slate had zero affiliation with DSA other than some brand appropriation and, if you’ll remember, everyone but Houston and Washburn wrote op-eds decrying the incredibly anodyne mailer People First Charter, which WAS a DSA electoral project, sent out. 

The Chamber and by extension the Press Herald’s messaging has been incredibly effective at making DSA out to be exactly what you’ve described us as: a group of gullible, idealistic twenty-somethings being taken advantage of by a sinister ex-mayor bent on reclaiming the throne. 

I work with Ethan a lot and the idea that he’s a mastermind is, honestly, extremely funny. He and I and some others organized our tenants union, and both just got elected to the new DSA campaign committee, so maybe i’m under the sway of his evil tricks, but I like him despite often disagreeing with him on tactics. 

He’s extremely opinionated, has an ego, does not know how to use technology, and can generally be a pain in the ass but accepts when he’s lost a vote and does the work that the body has decided to do, which is invaluable in a volunteer org. 

Also I haven’t interacted with Steven Biel but he seems like a liability and I personally have no interest in associating with Progressive Portland, but outside of that Strimling got successfully smeared by Jennings and the PPH, and that narrative is uncritically accepted by most armchair Portland Politics watchers, as well as the majority of people holding office right now. 

Because of that perception, plus the fact that DSA has been historically unable to prove very useful in a local campaign, there IS no locus of power within the left. I think that’ll change, as DSA’s been taking time away for the Portland electoral cycle(to Ethan’s chagrin) to develop better internal structure/ discipline as well as be a better coalition partner, but in the meantime “progressive” electeds can still get mileage out of perfomatively blaming us whenever they do something unpopular because of our association with strimling.

"the ""accountability"" part comes because if the mayor does not do what you want, you (the voters) can fire them in exchange for someone who will (or at least says they will :p  ).    


Currently, with the city manager making decisions, if they don't do what you like you can not fire them. (we dont get a vote on this :( )   


The ""blame"" is spread out enough that no one can be held to task.  You gonna get 5+ councilors run out of town?  Unlikely.    


Instead, we need a ""buck stops here"" type of thing, so that someones job is on the line if they do not do what voters want.  


For me, its the portland Housing Safety Office and the Permitting and Inspections department that needs to be held accountable. They really fail at their work, and I would love to get into it with you.

"If you've been attending the governance committee meetings, you'd understand her logic. She's asked good questions and brought her own research.

Our first black mayor (Jill Duson) supports the council manager form of government. Our former Jewish, Irish, Gay, Women, etc... Councilers and mayors support the CM form of government.

It's interesting how all of a sudden, Duson's, Thibodeau's, Costa's, Geraghty's, Pringle's, Brennerman's, Snyder's, Chong's, etc opinions don't matter because they don't fit the rich white people's (Biel, Figdor, etc) narrative. Tom MacMillan's paper was like half true too. The CM form of government came about to fight curroption. Over 400 cities in non-klan influenced elections had already switched in the two years prior to Portland starting in 1920.

And who would have thought? Data still shows that council manager forms of government are far less likely to be curropt.

"In Cumberland County, Family Crisis Services offers a wide array of services, including all levels of intervention, hookups with legal support and housing services.  They’ve been around for a long time and they are well and truly tied into everything that’s available. 

It sounds like you’re trying to keep this whole situation managed in some kind of super discreet fashion and I have to tell you, there is only one person that works for, and that person is not you.  

You need help.  The price of that help is probably going to involve people knowing you need help, which means people are going to know things have not been okay.  Try calling Family Crisis Services for a start.  They’re pretty solid, and they may be able to help you navigate a way out with the level of discretion you’re seeking.

"I'm going to preface this by saying my home buying experience was in the Farmington area not Portland. Me and my wife bought our first house in Wilton in 2018 for 110k. It's 1800sqft, on 1.25 acres. It's nearly in the middle of town, close to schools, stores, gas stations, on a small hill with only 2 neighbors and access to the multi use trail. I was in contact with the realtor we dealer with to buy the house recently because we've come to the decision we want to move a little farther north, say Bangor area. My realtor told me if we wanted to be out of the house in a week he could put it up at 200k and get bids only increasing from there. That's great for us, literally double our money in 4 years. But who's paying that much money for this house, that was appraised at barely 120k 4 years ago? It's not average Mainers. It's rich coasties or out of staters. We bought this house as first buyers in our mid twenties, nothing to our names except 2 auto loans for 10 year old cars. So far it's been our home, a crash pad for friends, party central, a temporary home for family in need, home to 2 dogs and 2 cats, and soon to be home to our first child. There is no way in a cold day in hell we could've afforded this house for much more than we originally paid. I told me realtor we'd have to think about it, because who are we as Mainers, who were once young, broke, inexperienced, and just looking for our little slice of the dream to price this house out of the realm of reality for others *just like us* for nothing other than our own greed. Maine is being destroyed by Mainers that have lost their way after bring tempted by people from away waving Benjamin's in their faces, knowing if they just kept living the way they were they'd never see money like that. Then they bitch and complain that we're being overrun by out of staters trying to make Maine anything else than what it already is and should be. If we all love Maine as much as we say, it's our responsibility to do what we can to keep it this way and to help our fellow Mainers first and foremost and to keep Maine for Mainers.

"I think you’re right - it’s been on the market 11 days, so realistically the sellers talked to a realtor anywhere from 2-4 weeks ago when there would have been even fewer houses for sale on the market.

I searched for active listings between 400-500k in the Portland/Sopo/Cape/parts of Falmouth and Westbrook, and this is just not an attractive listing. 

This house isn’t even a thousand feet away, is bigger and more updated, and is listed for 30k less:

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/56-Fall-Brook-St_Portland_ME_04103_M42683-68339

And then there is 145 Mitchell Road in Cape… this actually sold in December for 394k. Now listed for 445k. Which is absurd in and of itself, but as someone who went under contract in November after missing out all summer and fall, I do think that there was some fatigue around that time and the current seller might’ve seen it as a value buy. Regardless: that house is listed at 445k and gives you Cape schools and puts you walking distance from Willard Beach:

""Maine law requires that dogs who are 6 months of age or older must be licensed in the municipality where the dog resides. 7 MRS §3923-A. Dog licensing can be done online or at your local city or town hall and involves a small fee. In addition to licensing, Maine requires that within 30 days of turning 6 months old, dogs must be vaccinated against rabies. 7 MRS §3916. Your veterinarian may recommend additional vaccines and certain businesses such as dog groomers, boarding kennels or doggy daycares may require those vaccines in order to provide services.
So your dog is licensed and vaccinated and now you’re ready to hit the parks and trails? Hold on – Maine law states that it’s illegal for any dog to be “at large” except when being used for hunting. 7 MRS §3907. “At large” is defined as being off of the premises or the owner and not under the control of a person “whose personal presence and attention would reasonable control the conduct of the animal.” Many municipal ordinances refer to this as voice control and require that any off leash dog be under the voice control of its owner.""
