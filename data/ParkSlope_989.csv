"Hi everyone! Thanks for the shoutout u/AndydeCleyre. I'm down to share my opinions here and hope I can help you out u/poseidondieson, but it sounds like we already have a difference in taste. I will say this: I live in Windsor Terrace, closer to Kensington, and it's a good slice desert out here! Park Slope has some decent options, but I generally stick to two on either end of the neighborhood.

First off- Antonio's on Flatbush is my go-to slice place. I'm sorry your experience their last week wasn't a good one, but I've personally never had that problem. I've only ever had great pizza there. For South Slope, I go to Luigi's on Fifth. 

Over the years I've lived nearby (about 10-15 years) I've had good experiences at Roma, Smiling, La Bruschetta, Pizza Plus, and Pizza Town, but never amazing- just decent. I would go to any of those places if I'm hungry, but I would never seek it out. It's all strictly based on convenience. I used to like Joe's a lot, but it has really gone down in quality over the past several years. Someone recommended La Villa to me and I did not enjoy that one at all. 

For what it's worth, I've heard L'Arte Della Pizza is pretty good, but I haven't been yet so I can't speak from experience.",t2_4sth0,ontherok,0,1648245642.0,0,t1_i24d7zs,i24d7zs,False,poseidondieson,t3_tntcdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkslope/comments/tntcdw/smiling_roma_or_pinos/,"Smiling, Roma or Pinos?",/r/parkslope/comments/tntcdw/smiling_roma_or_pinos/i24d7zs/,2,r/parkslope,0,2

"The baby pizza at Pinos is great. Especially if you love onions. 

I’m more from south slope area so grew up on Joe’s. That pizza is garbage (talking about ppw/prospect Ave Joe’s). There was also sabella back then (now Sicilian) and that pizza ain’t great either (but better than Joe’s). 

Agree about da nonna Rosa. Probably best traditional pie in the hood (I’m not counting lavilla or peppinos style pizzas). 

I also think Antonio’s on Flatbush has crap pizza. Had a slice last week and it was not good. Just dry chewy meh.

"Current Harbor Fitness member here. I’m also a pretty big gym nut and have had memberships all over the city and Brooklyn over the years. 

Harbor Fitness is a good gym. It’s clean, the staff is nice, and it’s surprisingly big/roomie given the space. 

My only real complaint is that it’s super broey. It’s a gym so that’s to be expected, but it’s definitely more broey than say Body Elite in CG (RIP) or the gym on Union and 7th Ave. 

The downstairs generally has too much testosterone and is too cramped for my liking which is a drag because that’s where the free weights are. 

But overall it’s very good and well worth the cost. I would also avoid the Armory unless you need to swim. I would go to Crunch across from Harbor Fitness before going back to the Y.

"Tl;dr:

Layla Jones (delivery to park slope)

Giuseppina’s

Public Display of Affection

Peppino’s

Luzzo’s (doesn’t deliver to park slope but worth the trek down Atlantic Ave)


I believe it’s in Cobble Hill but still delivers to Park Slope (where I’m located at least), Layla Jones “Sweet Jane” pizza is incredible. They have a pesto sauce on it that absolutely takes the flavors to the next level. (If you’re like me you’ll also want to have some Tums on standby for this one). 

Other than that, I’ve found Giuseppina’s mentioned elsewhere in this thread to be pretty great. Also check out PDA (Public Display of Affection) for a great Neopolitan pie. If you want something more traditional I’ve recently found Peppinos to be pretty solid, not the absolute best pizza I’ve ever had but a strong contender with more topping options than a lot of other places (if, like me, you like the occasional pineapple pizza). 

The only pizza I’ve had in this area worth traveling outside the neighborhood for would be Luzzo’s on Atlantic Ave, really high quality stuff plus amazing non-pizza entrees and cocktails.",t2_78qgl,Articunozard,0,1641232646.0,0,t1_hr3ld97,hr3ld97,True,Raspberry__Queen,t3_rv4whe,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkslope/comments/rv4whe/can_we_get_a_pizza_thread_going/,Can we get a pizza thread going?,/r/parkslope/comments/rv4whe/can_we_get_a_pizza_thread_going/hr3ld97/,3,r/parkslope,0,3

"No, but two stories.  I was having breakfast at a large table and there were two options,  order off the menu or pay the flat rate buffet.  I ordered off the menu.  I took one bite of my nieces buffet donut that she was discarding.  They charge me 50 cents for that.  I took that out of the tip.  Yes that is the wrong thing to do, but it was only 50 cents.  It was more of the principle that they were watching us very closely and that I was taking a bite out of a donut that was being discarded.  I am sorry waitress, but really?

Not a restaurant, but a negative tip.  I took a cab from the airport home  He clearly, deliberately made a wrong turn and added 40 minutes to our ride.  I've taken this ride many times before and it is generally a $20-25 metered fare.  I left him $20 and had an argument with him.  He actually confessed and acknowledged what he did, and said that I should pay him $25 because thats what the fare should be.

The type of person most commonly moving Park Slope these days (upper-middle/upper class with a family) has a car for lifestyle purposes, not as a preferred alternative to public transit for their daily commute. And they can afford the luxury. There are families on my block with two cars, and they don't even bother to move them for street cleaning, they just pay the tickets!

"i didn't downvote you. i'm also not a NIMBY and i'm not some kind of industry booster.

the point i was trying to make is that sometimes people see a functioning business as ugly nothingness, with the blanket assumption that it's always better to add new residential construction because of the benefits it brings, irrespective of the less-visible ripple effects it might have and the greater trends at play.

even your (semi-smug) opportunity cost link assumes we're just weighing ""more productive vs. less productive"" or ""better vs. worse carbon footprint"" when my main point is that it's a layered issue with difficult-to-account-for effects. add to that the fact that we tend to push these types of businesses on neighborhoods we deem expendable, which is always more-distant and less-rich, and yeah i'm not really YIMBYing.

you'll notice that in the end i basically agree with /u/JacksonHeightsOwn in terms of the net benefit of this one  situation, but in terms of the broader trend, I can't help but wonder if it's healthy for a city to shove everything but residential, service, office, and retail out to the fringes? doesn't seem like it, but i guess we'll find out in like 50 years.",t2_4eqr0,hatts,0,1634791807.0,0,t1_hhgfon9,hhgfon9,False,PaleRain4581,t3_qc68cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkslope/comments/qc68cq/17story_tower_might_replace_taxi_business_on/,17-Story Tower Might Replace Taxi Business On Fourth Avenue,/r/parkslope/comments/qc68cq/17story_tower_might_replace_taxi_business_on/hhgfon9/,1,r/parkslope,0,1

a taxi depot like that serves a large fleet of cars, which go on to serve thousands of people. every half mile out from manhattan we push it means longer trips for the cabs, worse business for the depot, more emissions from the cabs, more inconvenience for the drivers, etc.

-Next time Hertz had a line out the door 2 hours long for a scheduled rental. It was insane.

-Next (Zip-Car again), the day of rental, they changed the car I was supposed to rent without a notification, I found replacement the car they assigned to me with the trunk crushed in from being rear ended, and they had to reassign me again with a car a 30 minute walk away.

"Part of the trick is that car ownership skyrocketed during the pandemic, when people who could afford to invest in a car at that point wanted to avoid public transit.

With luck, as things get better, we'll see those cars sold back off.  This isn't going to reduce traffic beyond levels that it was pre-pandemic, but it'll help.

But really, buildings keep getting bigger. More people keep moving to the city. Without continuing to improve mass transit, this problem will only get worse over time.

We need more trains. More buses. And very likely even more solutions. (Driverless car service that times when it picks people up and drops them off, for example.  Fewer owned cars that way, which should mean fewer cars on the road total.)

But none of this is a tomorrow solution.  Killing off workable roads is only going to make other roads more congested.

"Yes ... this is from the 2007 study:

The study, which looked at 7th Ave. between Union and 12th, finds some alarming things about the vehicle traffic in Park Slope.
45% of total traffic is cruising for a parking space. 
64% of local traffic is cruising for a parking space.

free street parking allocates public space for an excludable private use that is only available to the minority of city residents who own cars. you can think of free street parking as theft because the city is effectively redistributing the foregone revenue of what the parking “should” cost to the car owners - it’s a regressive tax on everyone else. more reading here https://econlife.com/2010/08/parking-problems/,t2_5bx7z7a1,sonoroso,0,1633728720.0,0,t1_hfwkrsc,hfwkrsc,False,michaelmobile999,t3_q45c3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkslope/comments/q45c3r/cars_in_park_slope/,Cars in Park Slope,/r/parkslope/comments/q45c3r/cars_in_park_slope/hfwkrsc/,12,r/parkslope,0,12
