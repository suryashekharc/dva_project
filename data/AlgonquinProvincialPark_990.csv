"I really don't think you'll need to worry about portaging the 3400, or the 1580 or 2065 before it, even with fairly new canoeists. The first like 100m of the 3400 is class II, but otherwise that whole section is just fun, bouncy class I. All you need is to pay attention and have the basics of how to maneuver. Have your group spend some time watching videos of how to canoe whitewater (Bill Mason's videos are great resources) and do some practice on flatwater, but you'll be fine.

"The beaches on Traverse are glorious. Highly recommend you take the first afternoon to lounge out. The three on the north shore, east end, but before the three in a tight triangle are all stellar.

We pushed hard the first day and made it to the Natch. If you've done any research on your route, you'll know the ones under it are grand. Best is the right one to the left of the cliff face, but it tends to get taken pretty early in the day though. Of the five around the Natch, the one to the south around the bend is by far the worst. Avoid if possible.

I really like the site at the NE of Whitson. Have camped on it a few times. None of the sites on Smith are particularly great (or if any are, it's back from the waterline). McManus is busier, but has nicer sites than Smith.

"> 1) Do you have a dedicated solo boat or do you paddle a tandem solo? If so what kind of tandem?

I paddle a 15' Swift Keewaydin Pack canoe. I've paddled solo in a regular solo canoe, and in the pack, and the pack is far easier to handle as a solo. Especially with a kayak paddle (though, as has been mentioned, you need a pretty long one for a pack canoe).

> 2) Do you single or double carry portages?

I single all my portages. On a 10 day trip, my pack comes out to ~60lbs with food, so with the canoe, paddle, lifejacket, etc. I'm carrying ~100lbs (over half my body weight). Be aware of what you can carry when making this decision, though. If you're contemplating single carrying, definitely recommend going around the neighbourhood with everything to see how it feels.

> 3) Do you use a single blade or double blade paddle?

As mentioned, I use a double blade. I find it far easier to steer with, and it's worth it's weight in gold when it's windy on the larger lakes. I've put some kayak clamps on my yoke so I don't actually have to carry it on the portage, too. Single portaging everything with hands free is very nice.

"1. Always a dedicated solo boat when tripping solo. I've paddled a tandem boat solo many times but it's way less comfortable and efficient to paddle solo compared to a dedicated solo boat. If you've never paddled a solo boat before it will feel tippy at first, but you'll get used to it very quickly. It's also way more fun to paddle since each stroke has stronger influence / the boat is more maneuverable with each stroke
2. I double carry portages but that's because I'm a small guy and the full weight of all my gear including food, canoe, camera gear, etc. is more than 75% of my bodyweight. It's less about the boat you have (solo vs. tandem) and more about the total weight of your gear relative to your carrying ability. I've single carried while travelling solo before, but for my size relative to my gear weight, it's just not worth it. Although like u/Gunner22 you'll want to pay attention to the seat placement to make sure you can comfortably portage all your gear at once if you plan on doing single carries (but this largely depends on your pack size and shape as well).
3. Always a single blade. I brought a double blade on my first few solo trips and it definitely helped in windy conditions, but I much prefer paddling with a single blade and I'm at the point where I'm comfortable enough with a single blade in all safe paddling conditions. 

I wrote this article recently that you might enjoy reading, it covers these exact questions plus a bunch more: [https://algonquinbeyond.com/blog/15-tips-to-help-plan-your-solo-canoe-trip/](https://algonquinbeyond.com/blog/15-tips-to-help-plan-your-solo-canoe-trip/)",t2_tpajv,sketchy_ppl,0,1648048194.0,0,t1_i1sxu1f,i1sxu1f,True,LeutDan,t3_tkthz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/tkthz5/solo_paddler_questions/,Solo Paddler Questions,/r/algonquinpark/comments/tkthz5/solo_paddler_questions/i1sxu1f/,6,r/algonquinpark,0,6

">1) Do you have a dedicated solo boat or do you paddle a tandem solo? If so what kind of tandem?

I paddle a tandem prospector 15 solo.  I was looking at solo canoes, but after lots of test paddling I decided a prospector 15 was the best fit for me, regardless if I was going to be solo or not.


>2) Do you single or double carry portages?

Single.  Another reason why I bought a tandem.  If you have a full pack, single carry is very uncomfortable as your pack will push up on the seat while you portage, thus pushing the bow of the canoe down.


>3) Do you use a single blade or double blade paddle?

I much prefer single, but I do bring a double if I want to cross big water or am fighting a stronger headwind",t2_e6aw5,Gunner22,0,1648043140.0,0,t1_i1sleb7,i1sleb7,True,LeutDan,t3_tkthz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/tkthz5/solo_paddler_questions/,Solo Paddler Questions,/r/algonquinpark/comments/tkthz5/solo_paddler_questions/i1sleb7/,3,r/algonquinpark,0,3

You might want to check water levels for that time of year. We went on Canada day weekend and had no problems but I’m sure they drop later in the summer. You don’t need the portage. We drop our stuff on the side of the hwy then park our vehicle in the spruce bog parking lot. The first site you come to after travelling the creek has a steep landing.

"If you're going on a weekend in the summer months and want to do an easy trip without too many portages, it's going to be hard to avoid the crowds.

Magnetawan to Ralph Bice or Little Trout is a good option with pretty lakes and lots of nice sites to choose from. It will be busy though.

Source to Bruce is good if you want something quick and easy, and you would have Bruce to yourself.

I really like Ragged Lake and think it would be a great choice. You're right that Smoke can get choppy but if you get on the water right after sunrise you'll avoid the worst of the winds and more importantly, the worst of the crowds.

Shall to Shirley is another good option with only one portage (though it's longer than the option options at 1km). Shirley won't be too busy with through traffic and has plenty of nice campsites, most with a beachfront, and they're spaced away from each other so there's a feeling of remoteness.

"The route is better done clockwise but there's no reason you can't do it the other way.

If you go counterclockwise you'll be doing the longest 3km portage on Day 1 with your heaviest load (all of the food weight), and then you'll be paddling west on Louisa against prevailing winds.

There's a steep incline at the Louisa end of the 1.7km so you'll be climbing that at the start of the portage and it will drain you for the rest of the trail.

Those are pretty much the only negatives, so it's really not a huge deal. If you have the luxury of choice, go clockwise, but if things are booked and counterclockwise is the only option, definitely still do it.

"This is all excellent advice. The one point I would make is that your paddling times while solo will vary greatly depending on weather. Much more so than tandem.

"A kayak paddle helps for when the winds pickup. Personally I prefer one to a traditional paddle when out solo, just find it more efficient. 
Routes would depend on which access point you're willing to travel to.

"I mostly solo trip, you can check out my trip reports for a lot of details re solo tripping: [algonquinbeyond.com](https://algonquinbeyond.com)

But to summarize some tips...

\- Paddling solo is very different than tandem, but it depends what type of boat you have or will be renting. You can paddle a tandem boat by turning it around and sitting in the front seat facing backwards (if the boat has a symmetrical design). But the boat is still likely longer and wider than a dedicated solo boat, and you won't be exactly centred, so overall you won't move as fast and you will have less control of the boat especially in windy conditions. If you can get a proper solo canoe, do that. It will feel more 'tippy' at first but you'll get used to it quickly

\- It's a good idea to bring a backup paddle, and if it's your first time and you aren't sure about your abilities, make one of your two paddles a double blade paddle. It will help you in windy conditions if needed

\- Lots of solo trippers are choosing 'pack boats' these days where you sit on the ground instead of an elevated seat, and you use a double blade paddle only. I personally do not like these but you can look into pack boats vs. regular solo boats and see which you prefer

\- Stay close to shore, especially in windy conditions. Doing a self-rescue with a flipped boat when you're by yourself is extremely difficult. You probably won't flip, but if you do, you don't want to be in the middle of a huge lake.

\- Once your gear is out of the boat and at the campsite, if you want to go for a paddle and there's any chance of it being windy on the water, make sure you add weight to the boat to help with control and prevent the wind from bullying you. Some heavy rocks and/or firewood in the bow and stern of the boat will do the trick.

\- Keep a GPS communication device on you at all times, ideally one with two-way communication. Not just in the boat but literally on your body somewhere. I personally use and would recommend an InReach Mini.

\- Assume you will be double carrying all of your portages. Even if you think you can single carry, plan your timing around double carrying. You don't want to plan a trip expecting to single carry, and once you're out there you find out it's not possible and you need to double carry, but now your route is way too long and not doable.

\- Give yourself extra buffer time for every single task. Setting up a tent, collecting firewood, prepping and cleaning dinner... everything takes longer when you need to do it by yourself. Until you get comfortable with all chores and know exactly how long it will take you, assume it will take 1.5x longer than normal.

\- I won't give route advice here because there are just so many options, but the trip reports on my website (linked above) should be some good inspiration and give you some ideas. Plus, you never mentioned how long your trip is going to be so no one can really give route advice without that info.

\- Always err on the side of caution. Always. Don't do any cliff jumping while swimming, don't try and be superman on the portages carrying your bodyweight worth of gear and end up injuring yourself, etc. You're by yourself and if something goes wrong, no one is there to offer immediate help. Be smart about everything you do.

\- Plan a rest day in the trip, or at the very least a couple really easy days. Take some time to appreciate the environment and being alone out there. It doesn't always need to be a constant hustle. Wake up for the sunrise and go for a paddle, stay up late to stargaze, etc. Those will be your favourite memories.

I'll stop here because I've already written a ton but if you have any other specific questions feel free to ask. I'll probably take this comment and turn it into a blog post for my website with the amount I just wrote lol",t2_tpajv,sketchy_ppl,0,1646696679.0,0,t1_hzrrsfn,hzrrsfn,True,Pai467,t3_t925jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/t925jf/first_time_solo_canoeing_advice/,First time solo canoeing advice,/r/algonquinpark/comments/t925jf/first_time_solo_canoeing_advice/hzrrsfn/,40,r/algonquinpark,0,40

There is still a way to get the maps even though they've been pulled from the Avenza store by the creator.

The most important part is that you first try it logged in and it will fail. Sign out but while signed out go to the link again in the “+” symbol and try downloading it again in signed out or offline mode and it will download just fine. I have done this for many friends and it has always worked. When you sign back in it will be there. On my phone I had to make sure the screen stayed on because if the screen went to standby mode to download in the background it would need to restart for some reason.

"Start small and spend enough time preparing the proper materials.  Find some decent sized logs to use as a base to start the fire on.  Then get your birch bark.  Then small branches (dead spruce branches work great).  Get a bunch of small sticks about the diameter of your index finger.  Then pieces that are slightly bigger.  Find a nice dead standing hardwood.  Cut it down and split it into appropriate sizes.  Dead standing is crucial because it doesn't absorb water so it won't be frozen.  Once you get the fire going good enough there should be no issue keeping it going.  It does take some patience to get it going well though.

I like to test my skills and see if I can get a fire going in the winter with just the materials around me and a ferro rod.

Depending on the direction you're doing the loop, I would probably choose whichever of those two lakes you're doing last (smarter to keep the buffer day towards the latter half of the trip).",t2_tpajv,sketchy_ppl,0,1645898349.0,0,t1_hyjfz9m,hyjfz9m,True,GryphonBoi,t3_t225ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/t225ix/i_have_one_relaxation_day_on_my_loop/,I have one relaxation day on my loop catfish>burntroot>la Muir>hogan.. which lake should I book for the off day?,/r/algonquinpark/comments/t225ix/i_have_one_relaxation_day_on_my_loop/hyjfz9m/,3,r/algonquinpark,0,3

"On mobile but…I went to Camp Ahmek on canoe lake as a kid and did a lot of tripping in the park from 7-14 years old. Late 90’s early 2000’s. There were so many ghost stories they told about Tom Thompson and others. The scariest though were always about stairs in the woods. Tripping through the park and other wilderness sometimes you’d come across random sets of stairs in the middle of nowhere off a portage or game trail. All styles of stairs like they were just removed from a house. You were never, ever supposed to touch them. Stories ranged from getting bad luck or dying, haunted houses they used to be attached to where the inhabitants were eaten by bears or murdered etc. They were nothing but spooky stories until one day on a 7 day trip when I was about 11, this kid in my group climbed one. All the way to the top and jumped off. Everyone, even the councilors were a bit upset , freaked out and superstitious about him doing that. Well that evening while we made camp, that kid took an axe to cut some dead branches off a downed tree and he slipped and nearly cut his damn big toe off!! They had to duct tape the dangling toe on and one adult and the biggest kid tossed him in a canoe and paddled hard to the closest road to hitch hike to a hospital while the rest of us stayed with the one other adult. Never saw the kid again. I kind of blocked out the memory until a few years ago when there was series of posts on r/nosleep where a search and rescue officer told some stories including one about random stairs in the woods. Wish I could find it.

"We hiked for about 6 hours along the western uplands trails in late fall. We started later in the day and barely made it to our camp site. We arrived at our site about 30 mins after sunset. I was extremely exhausted, wet and chilly. The first thing we did was pitch our tents. The two other guys I was with finished up before me and went scrounging for wood.

I went about  laying my sleeping mat and bag in the tent. I turn around to reach into my backpack to get my flashlight to make sure everything was set up properly and I point it at the head of the sleeping bag and I see this face staring at me with a wide eye smile. I was startled and quickly recoil for a second but immediately punch my hand into the “face.”

If this is your first winter backcountry, you may want to consider something with shorter legs and more established routes.  The Highland trail out of Mew Lake is perfect for a first timer in winter.  It also gives access to some lakes for that experience you are looking for as well.

I haven't done that specific trip, but have done plenty of paddling in Georgian Bay near the French river as well as further south.  

Georgian Bay is big water, and the winds can whip up pretty rough water, even in relatively sheltered areas.   That being said, some days can be like glass.

APP's average ice out date for canoeing is late April to mid May, but this doesn't necessarily mean *all* of the snow or even ice will be gone from the area.  I've been on ice out canoe trips where portages still had snow, lakes still had some shore ice, and we experienced snow at night. 

Last year, the park wasn't giving out overnight permits from late March until they declared ice out, so this could foil your plans entirely.

Bugs can be completely non existent. Less heat and humidity is more comfortable for hiking. Much easier to get the good camp sites without the crowds.

Kawartha highlands is great, I did my first backcountry there a couple summers ago from the bottle lake access point. They have campsites right on the lake, and you can portage deeper if you want. We went swimming on our campsite but it’s not a beach, just rocky. I believe some sites on the end of the lake have small beaches which might be good. 

There’s also Bon Echo, which is probably a bit busier but has more sites on the lake. I’ve never been so I can’t comment on the swimming part of it or the how busy it is. 

I really did enjoy Kawartha highlands as a first trip so keep it in mind. Also you book the specific site you want instead of the lake like Algonquin.

"Almost every lake will be good for swimming, it's the specific campsite that matters more. Since campsites are first-come-first-serve on a given lake, it's kind of impossible to answer the question. Rock Lake for example has paddle-in campsites (ie. no portaging) and some of them will be great for swimming, but some others may not. 

If swimming is your main priority I'd recommend choosing a lake like Rock Lake where there are plenty of campsites, as you'll likely find one available that suits your needs.

It also depends where you're coming from. If you want to start a trip from Hwy 60, Rock Lake is your best option for the reasons I mentioned, considering that Canoe Lake, Smoke Lake, Cache Lake, and Source Lake (some of the other access points off Hwy 60) all don't have campsites on them so you'll need to do at least one portage.

My comments are just so others who read this post are aware that it may not be reliable to count on in its current state. 

I found significant portage distance errors on the most popular Algonquin loops close to the access point like heading from canoe lake to burnt island so in its current state, I wouldn't trust it to plan a trip with.

Access 1 offers some short loops from North Tea into Lost dog, sisco, lorne.  Or you could grab a site in the west arm of NT and do some day tripping.

Access 9 Rock to Penn or Clydegale, then Galeairy and back out through Rock.  Very historical area, busy in the summer but beautiful none the less.

"Yes and no on the snow shoes.

On the way in there was a trail that was pretty packed down by previous Hikers.  It was rather thin, and snow shoes may or may not have been good.

On the way out, a groomer had gone by on some of the trail, which fluffed up the snow a fair amount and made it a little more difficult for travel.  Snow shoes would have been helpful here.

So I guess the answer leans more to yes than to no.

"Hey there.

It went well! A good time was had. 

I don't have the exact list of sites we stayed at on hand, but we did start at Access Point 22 and leave via Squirrel Rapids. I think I'd recommend that, because Barron Canyon is very nice. If you really wanted to come and go from the same place, I'd say make that near Squirrel Rapids. 

All this said, the amount of Portaging on one of our days hit our limit. We were 4 guys in our 30s, and the day of the most portaging was also the day it rained. Because of booking, out site that day was a little out of the way, and I had to quell a rebellion that said no one is in the park because of the rain, let's just grab a closer spot. 

All that to say, maybe if you book early, you can get an efficient route. I don't know what your level of fitness is, but there are certainly portages in this area that are nothing to sniff at. 

Let me know if you have more questions, and I'll see if I can pull out our map...",t2_2uk76dd1,WLMKing,0,1642870245.0,0,t1_htreylq,htreylq,False,WLMKing,t3_nrvct1,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/nrvct1/first_timer_looking_for_outfitter_recommendations/,First timer looking for outfitter recommendations - Access Point 22,/r/algonquinpark/comments/nrvct1/first_timer_looking_for_outfitter_recommendations/htreylq/,2,r/algonquinpark,0,2

"Don't take this the wrong way as I'm totally not trying to be an elitist or anything and just want to give you the best recommendations, but how experienced are you with a canoe route like this yourself? 

Dry bags aside, with all the other stuff you need to bring everyone else is going to need a pack of some kind, so it's probably an easier arrangement just to have everyone carry their own stuff plus spreading of the shared items.  If you want to keep the dry bags separate in another large dry pack for double insurance, it really depends on your gear and how much stuff you are putting in dry bags. If it's just an emergency pair of clothes for everyone sure. If you are trying to cram everyone's clothing and sleeping bags in there then probably not.

September weather can be anything really, hot and dry, or rainy and quite cool. If you run into multiple days of rain and cool weather and have to tear down and set up camp multiple times in that weather, you better have a plan and the right gear to keep sleeping pads, bags and clothing dry or it's going to get miserable fast.

"I don't think it's the best route, especially for first-timers. I would choose lakes with nicer campsites and more expansive views, it's more likely to impress people if it's their first trip. Start from #3 just north and loop from Mag > Ralph Bice > Little Trout > Queer > Little Misty > Daisy > Mag

There's only one long portage but if you can snag a reservation on Little Misty, then you can take your time on the portage because you know exactly which campsite you're getting (only one permit on the lake).

Something like Little Trout x2 > Little Misty > Daisy. A mix of travel days and rest days is great for first-time trippers to really let them enjoy the peacefulness of the park. You can always day trip on the rest day if you want to explore, or just relax around camp.

Ralph Bice x2 > Daisy x2 would be a really easy option that would be good for first-timers as well.

"There's lots of good advice here so I'll keep it to a minimum.

First aid knowledge and supplies are really not optional for backcountry camping. Prepare for the worst.

For a first-time trip, ten people seems like way, way too much — considering that no one in the group has experience. I would *strongly* recommend building your skills and gear with a smaller, more manageable group before undertaking a large trip like this. I have over twenty years of backcountry experience and I would still be very, very hesitant to travel with such a large group, even if it was only a minority who had no experience.

I can't speak to the hiking sites, but 9 is the maximum number of people who are allowed to stay on any paddle-in backcountry sites.",t2_b9795,eachfire,0,1642434646.0,0,t1_ht1sj0f,ht1sj0f,True,[deleted],t3_s64mhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/s64mhg/first_time_backcountry_camping_tips/,First time backcountry camping.

"Other advice, coming from a Scouter - you're going to want to divide yourself up into smaller groups/teams for food and cooking. Large stoves are not practical for backcountry camping. With 10 people, you might want to do 5 groups of 2, each with a jetboil type stove, or you could maybe do 4 groups (2 of 3, 2 of 2), each with a small stove. If you have something like a dragonfly stove (bigger jet type stove) you can cook for 4 people, BUT then you'll need bigger (and bulkier!) pots.  


Agree with others on water - I personally like gravity filters, but you do need to have some time to let them do their thing. You can also get filters that fit on water bottles (Lifestraw makes one that fits on a Nalgene and a few other brands) and then have a couple packets of aquatabs as a backup. You should ALWAYS have two methods of water purification on hand.  


Also, with a group that size doing a backcountry hike, I would HIGHLY recommend that you have at least 1-2 people with some first aid training and that you carry a decent size first aid kit and a basic supply of common meds (benadryl FOR SURE, chewable aspirin in case of heart attack, basic pain/fever relief like ibuprofen, and then immodium/pepto). Think about the most likely things to happen on a hike - twisted ankles, scrapes, infected bug bites, burns, sunburn, heat exhaustion, etc. - and make sure you have some supplies for those. BTW, nuun electrolyte tablets are awesome for dehydration and also make (filtered!) lake water taste better.  


I could go on, but others have shared lengthy lists, but as someone who spends most of their time before trips thinking about what could go wrong and how to react if that thing does go wrong, make sure you did a little advanced planning for different scenarios. Some sort of emergency beacon would be a good idea for a novice group of that size (most areas of the park have no cell service) - not 100% necessary, but a nice-to-have.  


And last, for food, remember that there are lots of foods available in grocery stores that are dried and shelf-stable. You just might need to repackage them - stuffing mix, instant mashed potatoes, ramen noodles, mac and cheese, freeze dried hashbrowns (costco!), just-add-water pancake mix, beef jerky, shelf-stable pepperettes, oatmeal, powdered milk, instant coffee etc. You don't have to just get the pricey foods from MEC.

"For that amount of people and first time backcountry camping I would highly recommend a gravity filter for producing drinkable water. People can get dehydrated easily, especially if consuming alcohol. Here are some options:  
[https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5035-528/GravityWorks-4-0L-Filter-System](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5035-528/GravityWorks-4-0L-Filter-System)

A filter of this nature may seem expensive but is extremely valuable. If needed you could divide that price by 10 and get a really reasonable dollar per person ratio.

You should know that you likely won't have to poop while squatting in the bush unless en route. Most (if not all) campsites have a ""thunderbox"". Bring TP in a waterproof container. A Ziploc bag is easily accessible and lightweight. While travelling to your destination you can always stop at a campsite (preferably unoccupied) to use the ""thunderbox"".

If travelling by water, for a group of this size and without experience, I'd suggest choosing a single site to stay all three nights as opposed to a route where you stay at a different sites each night. If you want, day trips from a base camp will allow you to see more of the park. This is my preference when travelling with a big group. As you/the group gain experience, picking a route with multiple sites might become an option.

Lists! Make lists! Provide list to others. Forgetting things suck. The best way to make sure you bring the items you want is to make a list and check off as packing.

If anyone has initiative, it's very helpful to learn a few knots. Helps for bear hang, setting up a tarp, tying canoe to a vehicle, etc. Not everyone needs to go to this effort but maybe someone in the group has interest. Knots to know would be: end of the line bowline, ,truckers hitch or modified truckers hitch, and a clove hitch.

The other commenters j89m and tuydbuyglar have excellent suggestions.",t2_d8593,fun4willis,0,1642432045.0,0,t1_ht1mfim,ht1mfim,True,[deleted],t3_s64mhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/s64mhg/first_time_backcountry_camping_tips/,First time backcountry camping.

"Its great you folks are interested in backcountry camping.

First and foremost, I recommend doing some reading beyond reddit and the internet. Pick up a copy of Kevin Callan's *The Happy Camper: Essential Guide to Life Outdoors*, which will cover all the basics you should know before you go.

To answer your questions:

* You can bring water purification tablets and/or a gravity filter. I usually rely on the tablets, but have also used a filter.
* I have a dehydrator and I dehydrate all meals before the trip, but you can buy freeze dried meals from MEC.
* In Algonquin, there are toilets called ""thunder boxes"" at every campsite. Its best to avoid pooping in the woods if you can (though sometimes on a portage, it has to happen)

Some tips:

* Read about bear safety. Its important to know how to hang your food/garbage at night, keep a clean campsite, and not have any scents in your tent (snacks, tooth paste, etc)
* Don't clean your dishes in the lake, clean them at your campsite and dump the food scraps in a hole in the woods far from your tents.
* If you're planning on canoeing, choose a very easy route for your first time. Maybe even stay at one campsite for all the nights 1-2 portages away from the access point.
* Ensure you are prepared for the weather. You should all have good rain gear, warm sleeping bags, etc.
* Bring a saw instead of an axe. With 10 people an axe is just an accident waiting to happen.
* ALWAYS leave the campsite cleaner than you found it.

10 people might make for a pretty hectic back-country trip. It should be noted that you're only allowed 9 people per site in Algonquin. Backcountry camping really requires everyone to pull their own weight, so it could be worth going car camping with these people first as a trial run. Really make sure everyone is on the same page, especially about safety.",t2_5wkhi4e5,Bongo_Goblogian,0,1642429717.0,0,t1_ht1hdf4,ht1hdf4,True,[deleted],t3_s64mhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/s64mhg/first_time_backcountry_camping_tips/,First time backcountry camping.

"For water, you should get either a water filter/pump to fill water bottles while you’re out there, or buy a platypus water bag that has a filter built in (usually fill the bag, then hang it and has a filter built into the line where you can fill a water bottle)

Make a solid food list where you plan meals for each day - bring lots of things like trail mix, granola bars, dried fruit, etc for snacks.  Bring a couple days worth of extra food in case of an emergency where you are stuck.

"The exact opposite is true here.  When in a hammock or a cot, the air gap between you and the ground is too big to retain any heat.  The heat circulates too much and is continuously pulling heat out of you and your sleeping system.

An underquilt creates a smaller air gap that is easier to heat up, with your body and that Boiled Nalgene bottle. This is what sleeping pads do on the ground, create a small air gap.

"I've always found the 745m between McIntosh Lake and McIntosh marsh to be really nice.  
The 1465m from Shippagew to Longer is a nice meandering walk through a hardwood forest. 

 A number of portages along the Tim and Nipissing rivers deeper in the park are very scenic, and are less traveled so they feel more remote. (Nipissing between Loontail Junction and the Remona Lake portage.  Tim between Shah and Shippagew)  The 1300m portage along the Nipissing River around ""High Falls"" is spectacular, and I think it's going to need to be rerouted to not have as nice a view of the falls soon: there are parts that are just about washed away long a steep slope down to a section of the falls!

"Did Tim river last July and I’m also really interested in the spring conditions… Our trip went like this…
The water level was so low that everyone was turning back after the 2nd beaver dam on Tim river (after Tim Lake). I’m estimating about 6 inches of water above the mucky bottom at best. We were dragging bottom the whole way and it took 7 hours to “paddle” to Rosebary. Half of the time I was using my foot to essentially turn the canoe into a water scooter (like skateboarding the canoe down the river) There were 12 Beaver dam’s to cross, each one lowering the water level beyond. The bugs were bugs. We were 1 of 2 canoes to make through that weekend as everyone else had turned back. So we decided to stay at Rosebary and cut our trip short a few lakes.

That being said it was one of the best trips I’ve done in the park. The Rosebary beach is a small paradise. The campsite to the east of the beach is one of the best I’ve seen in Algonquin. We saw a Moose along the Tim near the beginning.

The thing the to keep in mind is that it was July and I’ve since heard that you have to hit the river in the spring when the water level is higher.

If I remember correctly, the 'unmaintained' one from Maybe Pond to Potter's Creek is like that, though not one of the best I've been through.

The 3km portage east of Lake Louisa is also beautiful - we did it once during the yellow time in fall and it was honestly somewhat magical with all the shades, barely any green, and the leaves that were still hanging on the trees forming a tunnel to go through on a lot of the portage.

The openness of the short portage at the southwest end of Phipps lake is also quite neat to walk across (45.473394,-78.573847)

I don't know if there's a minimum number of people required, and it would obviously be more expensive, but if private car-camping in Algonquin is absolute must, this makes it possible.

"POG lake is great, you're in for a treat! I've been going with a group of friends for the past few years and there is a ton to do and I'll give you a little list of some things below:

\- IF you don't have one, rent a canoe right away! There are several outfitters that come by the campsites and it is very easy to do! Algonquin outfitters and Opeongo outfitters are both great companies with canoe's.

\- Once you have a canoe you're options really expand as Algonquin is basically just a ton of small lakes and rivers connecting together! Recommend getting a map and looking around POG lake but off hand there are I think 3 or 4 different rivers that branch off of POG lake that you can take to explore the surrounding area (There is even some small portages you can do). 

\- Fishing is a great time at Algonquin and depending on where you are you can get some really nice trout.

\- All the main trails are located on HWY 60 and are a nice break from canoeing if walking is more your style! I'd recommend lookout trail, it's pretty close to POG lake, is fairly short hiking trail but the view you get at the top is really amazing! On a nice summer day with a few cloud in the sky you'll think you've gone back in time cause it's just rolling hills, trees, and lakes as far as you can see. Great location to have a picnic/drink and hangout for a bit! Also great spot for pictures if you're into it! Beaver lake trail is also really cool/interesting and you will likely see a beaver while doing it!

\- There is a store at Lake of two rivers that sells some basic camping stuff so if you forget something you don't really have to fret to much (asides from the premium price you pay). It's also nice sometimes to get a meal when it's raining outside somewhere warm and dry. 

\- Sunsets on POG lake are some of the most tremendous sights I've seen in my life! Truly it's worth taking the last 15-20 minutes of the day, heading down to the beach and grabbing a spot to watch it set! The Loons start to come and fly around (dazzling stuff if you haven't seen it before) and the hues that the sunset gives off are super pretty!

\- If you can get your hands on one, get a portable grill! We roughed it the first few times and just cooked over the fire with the grate that they have at the designated campsite but this year we bought a coleman grill and actually made real food instead of just hotdogs and hamburgers! I love camp food but it's nice to eat something thats good for you while you're being active and outside all the time! Also, it was nice cause we each took a turn cooking a meal for everyone during our trip so we didn't all have to individually cook a meal. 

\- If you're into biking they have some really good biking trails too! You can rent a bike at the Lake of two rivers store or bring your own.

\- To me though, the real pleasure of Algonquin Park is the freedom to explore! I've been going for 5 years+ now and each time I go back I always feel like there is still so much to explore and see/do! 

We got lucky this past year and had our camp site right in front of the beach and some really interesting neighbors who were from Sweden! We ended up partying and playing music with these random people and honestly it was super sweet! Something about camping in the summertime in Algonquin is so special. Its hard to put into words but I always feel like my soul/being has been cleansed after a week there with friends outside of the city.

"Pog is a great campground! We've camped there a few times and have always enjoyed it.

May will probably be very buggy (mosquitoes and black flies), depending on the weather. Make sure to bring a good bug repellent! We always make sure to get one with DEET.

Spring is usually a good time to see moose along highway 60! Drive carefully and keep your eyes peeled.

Track and tower trail is my personal favourite on the west side of the park! Barron canyon is also a great little trail, but is a couple hours drive on the east side. Whiskey rapids trail is also a lot of fun but did have some flooding last year. I've heard great things about Mizzy Lake trail and Centennial Ridges but have yet to tackle these ones.

So I scream out and pretty sure wake up the whole campground but you could hear him run off . 
We wait a little then hear him dismantling a kitchen tent across from us  Then voices and car lights come on.
Turns out they left on granola bar out in the kitchen tent.  The two women left the next morning, i talked to one and she said her friend wouldn’t stay any longer. She asked if that was us who yelled and i said yeah. Only thing i could think of to do. 
talked to the rangers shortly after they said they knew the bear and that he was an older bear who they had been trying to trap but he was too familiar with their methods. One smart bear. 
They were kinda sad because they knew this bear well and usually they relocate but i got the impression this bear they would have to put down.

"Their shuttle service is amazing.

You'll have the canoe/other gear ready waiting for you at your chosen access point, and you simply leave it there right where you found it after the trip (unless you're not doing a loop, in which case you can arrange that they pick it up at your endpoint location).

One thing to consider: I had to still go to their Opeongo location to pay for the canoe/provide ID the day I needed the canoe. So plan to drive to their location in the morning, AND THEN drive to the starting point of your trip. Again, the gear will be there waiting for you, but you do need to visit them before you go on your trip for payment/ID information.",t2_65pq4o91,curiousfryingpan,0,1641225290.0,0,t1_hr3251o,hr3251o,True,kram1000,t3_rtm8vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/rtm8vk/canoe_shuttle_service_questions/,Canoe Shuttle Service Questions,/r/algonquinpark/comments/rtm8vk/canoe_shuttle_service_questions/hr3251o/,2,r/algonquinpark,0,2
"Rock lake is your best option. I've been to every single lake with a campground, and Rock is by far the best. Cedar lake could be an absolute nightmare to paddle if weather is windy, and Canoe/Smoke lake are extremely busy and don't feel like true camping.

Rock lake is beautiful, you can hike up the huge rock face there (I can send pics, just pm me), campsites are great and paddling isn't challenging when windy.

Another great option that isn't popularly mentioned is Magnetawan lake. There are campsites that are labeled as back-country sites right at the parking lot, so you can camp next to your car. The lake itself is small so you're not wind-dependant for paddling, and the surrounding portages are small/great for young ones. Fishing is also great.

There are only 2 or 3 sites on whitefish. One on the island so picked over firewood but nice and on on the west side. I stayed her a few years ago.
