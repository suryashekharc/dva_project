"When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, Bradenton photographer Allan Mestel immediately knew that he wanted to travel to Poland to capture images of refugees escaping the war-torn country.

""It was a calling,"" he told our Patch reporter. ""A need.""

Wanting to show how Russia's aggression in Ukraine has impacted real people, Mestel traveled to the Polish city of Medyka on the Ukraine-Poland border on March 11 and spent a week capturing heartbreaking images of refugees escaping the violence in their homeland. He plans to eventually organize a showcase of his work.

That totally depends on what you want to do- but honestly it would be significantly easier to do things with a car.

"If you cross over to the island from Bradenton on Manatee Ave (64) you will drive straight into the Manatee Public Beach. There is ample parking there normally but as everyone is writing you will be hard pressed to find a good spot during Eastertime. If you do get there, there is also a beach cafe/restaurant right there that serves breakfast through dinner. There used to be live music at night, not sure if that is still true. There are also chair/umbrella rentals there and a little store. If you travel north toward Anna Maria parking is harder to find. There are basically two different areas in that direction with shopping and food, etc. There is some public parking near the bayfront park. If you wanted to go to the beach south of the Manatee beach, cross over at Cortez instead and then drive south when you hit the island. You will find parking here and there and plenty of restaurants. You could also continue south to one of my favorite areas, Coquina Beach, there is plenty of parking there normally but again could be crowded at Easter and it will take awhile to get there. There is also another beach cafe down there and restrooms, changing rooms, etc. This would be at the southern tip of the island before crossing over to Longboat.

"Get up VERY early and head to the beach if you want to avoid sitting in traffic for an hour or more. By 8am traffic will start to thicken up, so if you can get moving around 7am you'll have the best luck. 

There are plenty of free parking spaces if you get there early enough. Forget it after 9am. After 10am you won't be able to find a parking space anywhere. There are restaurants all around there, so you can walk from the beach to the nearby places. Again, it's a holiday weekend, so be prepared for long waits and slow service.

Go between those and rainbow festivals and you will be around other like minded people and pick up some survival skills. Then you become part of the net work and stay in people farms in between gatherings. There are a lot of people who do this. They don't consider themselves homeless in the traditional sense but more so living off the land. Kind of like traveling communes. There is an expectation to contribute and skills are appreciated.

"My brother has been living this life for more than decade. Frankly, I'm shocked he is still alive. What you are describing is risky, but you know that so I won't preach. I do want to say, however, that it's not fair to blame your family for your situation. You're a 33 year old man, not some hapless teenager kicked out the day they turned 18. Owning up to your situation will help you survive out there, and will grant you a good deal of respect from others living outdoors.

The problem is, once you get ""known"" around a certain area, cops can fuck with you for any and no reason. Doesn't matter how well you behave. My bro has been arrested more than 50 times, not always because he was doing anything wrong. But moving all the time isn't practical either, especially if you're not familiar with the new area. And it can be very hard on your feet. Seriously OP, take extra good care of your feet. Wear socks and good sturdy shoes. Once your feet go it's very hard to get them back into shape.

My brother likes to meet fellow outdoorsmen at shelters. Apparently they're usually neatly divided into cliques, which makes finding his fellow drunks even easier. Maybe there's also a clique for the adventuring types like yourself? Dunno, might be worth looking into. A buddy can make life way better.

I would suggest trying to budget a cheap hotel once a week. Shower, watch some TV, soak up some AC and sleep in a real bed. Will do wonders for your outlook on life (works for my bro anyway). You can sometimes get away with using a Visa prepaid gift card if you don't have a credit card. 

Watch where you sleep, and stay away from bus stops after dark. Respect the local homeless heirarchy, they mean business. And seriously, take care of your feet.",t2_nq35m,FLORI_DUH,0,1643579175.0,0,t1_huwoatp,huwoatp,True,HaloRingHoneyBadger,t3_sgiv21,https://www.reddit.com/r/bradenton/comments/sgiv21/homesick_for_homelessness/,Homesick for Homelessness,/r/bradenton/comments/sgiv21/homesick_for_homelessness/huwoatp/,10,r/bradenton,0,10

"Bridge Street has several bars and decent restaurants, you can definitely do some bar hopping. However, it's not a hugely expansive street. 

Most bars/restaurants are pretty spread out around the island so I highly recommend renting a golf cart. The island is a fairly quaint community so night life is not exactly vibrant, if you want a late night then downtown Bradenton is about a 15 minute drive. I'm also in my 30's so my wife and I prefer more day drinking then night life, so Anna Maria is perfect for us.

Definite local restaurants to check out - Tide Tables for fish tacos, Mr. Bones, Wicked Cantina for happy hour, and The Beach House. Absolutely stay away from Gulf Drive Cafe (it's the huge tiki hut) it's a tourist trap - highly over priced and terrible quality.

Sarasota has great streets for cycling (wider bike lanes, actual markings for bike lanes, etc) but the same dangerous drivers. Typically when I see cyclists it's outside of rush hour traffic. Those bright 6-7pm nights in summer, or similar are very popular.

My office is in Sarasota - I live in Palmetto across the river from Bradenton. Before we went 100% remote, a few of my coworkers were very active cyclists, and one of them did triathlon events.

"We’ve moved a few hot tubs for my folks cause they always had one and we’ve moved a couple of times. All you need is a trailer and like for our five people. Some round posts (about ten) to act as rollers. Move it like the Egyptians moved slabs. You use a plank or two as a lever to pry the tub up and place rollers under it until its fully up. You need enough rollers to evenly spread across the bottom of the tub and a few to go in front of it, then as you roll it forward, replace used rollers from the back to the front.  After googling for example photos apparently this is a very common method and some people use pvc rollers instead of wood. We always used wood.

"About 8-9 months ago i went for a walk to my local WaWA for a cup of coffee. It was around 1am in the morning. Thats just the hours i operate, it is what it is. Anywho...

As i left my driveway i heard some yelling across the street at a bank. I stopped and observed. It was 2 black indivuals, 1 male, 1 female. The female was pounding the ever living shit out of this poor guy. He broke away from her and tried to run away, but she was relentless and the beating continued.  Not much i could do and im certainly not injecting myself in their mess..

As i got to the wawa i see a cop, hes walking to the door and we arrive at the same time. I said hello, very polite to him and mentioned what was taking place less than 300 meters away. I will never forget his response. ""Give me your ID"".  Not exactly what i has expected, so i politely refused. His response was, if you're not willing to help me then dont waste my time, and he walked inside.  

I walked home and the couple were still going at it in the parking lot, no a cop in sight, except the cop sitting in his car at the wawa, who was fully aware of the situation, and he did nothing other than try to violate my rights. And im not anti-cop in the least, but this was rather shocking to endure.
