"Nice, right by St. Matthias. It’s pretty chill sometimes you see a little commotion but it’s never a big deal. I have to second the fireworks comment, on Putnam by the train you will hear fireworks going off EVERY holiday especially in the summer but if you got to the roof/ sit outside it looks pretty so eh. There’s nice spots to eat, Ridgewood Ale House is pretty good and Hungry Burrito makes pretty good drinks, and all that but nothing is really stands out. Idk if Tasty’s on Myrtle reopened but my mom and grandma used to take me their all the time when I was little, it’s small but it has small town diner energy.

"Restaurants I like: Ltauha on Myrtle, classic bistro fare, great people run it, Porcelain for a fancy dinner with spouse, amazing Szechuan-Korean-adventure-fusion, Garam Masala for everyday indian, the pupusa place on Fresh pond for a cheap and filling lunch.

"I've lived in that area for over 10 years now. It's really safe. I've never ever had an incident. I've witnessed maybe a neighbor dispute ever so infrequently and they seemed like very very minor incidents. Its close enough to the city but also close enough to Flushing. The L, M, and Q58 bus are mostly reliable. The L can be really terrible during rush hour though. Parking is indeed terrible like the other person mentioned. You may want to keep an eye on garages for rent. Some house owners in the area rent out half their garage. 

Grimaldi's Bakery is excellent for donuts. True old fashion donuts. But you have to be there before 9 for the best selections. Very limited quantifies. 

Las Margaritas has AMAZING tacos and burritos. Quite frankly the best Mexican food in the area IMO. Huge portions and delicious. While in Kathmandu, great Nepal restaurant. All their dishes are excellent but definitely start with the momos. Variety Coffee, Dock Asian Eatery, Derek's food truck, and Nene's Taqueria also really fantastic. Walk a bit further to Metropolitan you'll find La Cocina de Mama, it is the most excellent Dominican food (and I used to live in Spanish Harlem up at 110st)!!

"Welcome. All my friends ended up moving here years ago, so about a year ago I moved myself. I’m thrilled, couldn’t be happier with the neighborhood.

I grew up on the edge of Jamaica, and Ridgewood is an entirely different Queens, commutes are pretty easy, interesting things are accessible. It’s great.

As for safety, NYC is incredibly safe these days. Growing up I had guns pulled on me multiple times, my family home was broken into multiple time. Now, it seems like the most common crime is people stealing Amazon packages, and even that seems to be less common than in the suburbs.

"Who is QNS Collaborative? We are a diverse group of Queens-based makers, organizers, community members and entrepreneurs collaborating to create a community space that makes creativity and community building accessible.

We envision the fullest embodiment of QNS Collaborative as a cooperatively owned and operated physical space that will offer retail space for small creators and curators; community workshops; resource, knowledge, and equipment sharing; and services + space to community members, organizers, mutual aid groups, and grassroots efforts. We seek to create a solidarity economy, built and controlled collaboratively and cooperatively by community members, for community members.

In this first iteration, QNS Collaborative will manifest as a collaboratively and cooperatively run temporary storefront at 25-09 Astoria Boulevard.

Why Now? Queens has always been full of small creators and self-made businesses, but it has not recently made accessible spaces to amplify and encourage these creators to thrive.

Earlier this year, QNSC surveyed the local community of small business owners and found that the large majority of them were looking for very simple things: an affordable place to sell their goods, resources that would help them take a fledgling business full time, and connection with creators in the broader community. We at QNSC hope to provide that space: one that provides resources, encourages a more localized economy and helps people get invested in their neighborhood’s wellbeing.

What’s happening next? It’s true, we have the opportunity to [temporarily] take over a storefront space at 25-09 Astoria Boulevard [the former home of @earthandme.nyc] and will be hosting a collaboratively and cooperatively run store showcasing Queens-based makers beginning mid-October through March 2022.

Here’s what we envision in this space:

Space for ~25 Queens-based makers/creatives/curators in a retail store. These Vendor Members will pay a monthly rental fee, consignment fee on sales, and participate in the care and coordination of the store [check the link in bio for more details on this]. Curation and collaboration with 3 Queens-based organizing communities (@queensliberationproject; @therollinglibrary; and @kaleidospacenyc) ~300 SqFt of storage, coworking, and small-meeting space for Vendor Members Pop-ups; Skill-shares; shopping parties; and small events for the QNSC @patreon Community [more on that coming soon!]

The QNSC Organizing Team has spent a lot of time the past months visiting available commercial spaces, building budgets, and working to realize some IRL version of QNSC in Queens. What we’ve learned is:

There are a ton of you who support the idea of a community-supportive space that connects community and creativity and fosters community over competition; Landlords don’t want to (read: won’t) rent to an unknown entity without any proof of concept and no financial foundation; We need to start now - even if it’s in a small footprint - to put this idea into practice, engage in new economies, and build the world we want to see for our futures.

How can you get involved? Our application to be a Vendor Member is OPEN [check link in bio] and applications must be submitted by 11:59pm EST on September 20.

"Try centers urgent care.

Make sure to do it quick if you want a quicker time.

"I live 1 block away from Milk & Pull (on Seneca btw—is that the one you mean?) and the area is very quiet at night, relatively quiet during the day (but I’m on the first floor in a street-facing apartment, so probably very quiet to most others).

Regarding prices, I moved here 1.5 years ago but I pay $2,025 for a 2-bedroom with a private backyard. I got a good deal, but I would say the 2/1 for $2100 is relatively standard pricing, although a bit better than average for sure. 

I can’t recommend this area enough—super close to the Seneca M and the Myrtle/Wyckoff M/L and lots of conveniences in the area, plus close enough to Bushwick to walk or take a <$10 Uber/Lyft to bars, etc. for when things are back to normalish.

Yes the rental market in this area is seeing prices about 25-30% lower because the rent really was being held artifically high by richer young people who have left due to the pandemic.

"Overall ridgewood isnt strongly divided. Multiple groups have pockets but its pretty mixed. Around freshpond its more European groups like polish, italian, albanian. Near bushwick/williamsburg its generally more latino groups and younger out of state people getting priced out of the more gentrified parts of Brooklyn. In terms of the quieter areas I would say the side blocks along fresh pond or the side blocks near Grover Cleveland. From myrtle avenue up to gates avenue to where it combines with forest avenue and back down to myrtle avenue is where it can get rowdy. A lot of cool bars there, Aunt Ginnys is a really chill place with a banging kitchen. Nowadays is also a sick spot. It is a great neighborhood but keep in mind we are are rapidly getting gentrified. Ive been here 15 years and seen this place transform. Real estate developers are offering millions in cash to some people that own the town houses around here. A lot of the town houses have been modernized already. Some of the out of staters have had multiple rent increases within the span of 6 months to a year. This is generally more in the rowdy area. The quieter area near fresh pond, to my knowledge, are not getting rent increases. Things could change because of corona, younger people have had to go back home.

"That sounds like a good plan. 

Your best bet will be to find him once the rain lets up as well. He’s most likely hiding somewhere from the wet and cold, so he may not come out even if he hears you right now. I know that’s not comforting but just telling you so you don’t get discouraged if you don’t find him right away. The street cats I care for won’t even show up for feedings on days like this because they’d rather take shelter from the rain.

"Used to live near the middle school just south of Myrtle in Ridgewood, close to Halsey L. I had a roommate who had a car but didn’t do garage parking. He needed it for work everyday, so he moved it pretty often. Sometimes he would get lucky and find a spot instantly at night (like 10pm), but sometimes he’d have to drive around for upwards of an hour. Sometimes he’d have to move the car in the morning or pay for the meter or something if it was that day for street sweeping. It’s a lot to keep track of, but it can potentially save you 200/mo as long as you can avoid any parking tickets or damage to your car.

"Krisch Realty is a small, old school operation (it's like its out of the 1970's in there, Barney Miller style). They have one incredibly negative review, but after reading it, I realize its a problem with the landlord and not the agent. We're a mixed race couple too, and had NO problem like what that reviewer said, so don't pay any attention to it. It's worth giving them a shot. The apartments they showed us were all units owned by homeowners; like upstairs apartments and the like. Even though we ultimately did not get an apartment through them, I liked the cut of their jib, and its worth giving them a shot for a day. 

Another one to try is Werba Realty. From what I can tell, they are the ""kings"" of Ridgewood realty. We never got a chance to try them out, But you see their name all over this neighborhood. 

There was another one that was GREAT, but unfortunately the name of his business escapes me at the moment, and I misplaced his card. It's unfortunate, because he showed us like 3 apartments in an hour, and they were all nice in one way or another. 

Ultimately, we got lucky and found a great unit ourselves on Craigslist that was up for like an hour, and then was taken down (I guess after we reached out), but we did try plenty of agents too who showed us a variety of apartments that we liked.

"its funny people are saying aunt ginnys had a wierd old man vibe because there is literally a weird old man i used to work with who i see there all the time when i pass by. ahaha

anyways, ive been to paradise for the burgers and fries let me tell you this... the burgers look nice but they are super salty.

the cheese fries just have a slice of kraft thrown on them and they leave it be, let it melt like its a dead body without a casket. they dont give a fuck.

thats not how u make cheese fries bruh.

shame on you.

 also the two times ive been there the cooks seem generally unhappy and the bartenders aren't much different.

i still think the bar is kinda nice.

"* Antica Trattoria: Great, non-pretentious Italian joint that's been there forever (or at least a few decades). great food and friendly staff.
* Krolewskie Jadlo: Polish restaurant with fantastic food. 
* Julias: New American type cuisine. Good food at a good price. 
* Houdinis: Gourmet brick over pizza in an old warehouse. 
* Zenith Thai: Might just be the best Thai in the city. At the very least; it's my favorite overall Thai place. 
* House Of Gyro & Shawarma: Not really a restaurant so much as a little shack that makes delicious... gyro and shawarma. Good prices too. You can eat there, but its mostly takeout. 

A lot of these places are on fresh pond road.
