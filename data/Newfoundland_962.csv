It's important to remember that most people on Reddit are socially dysfunctional and have little to no life experience. Feeling like they're making a difference by telling others to live their lives a certain way or they're selfish assholes is all that they have. They'll rant and rave about having empathy and doing the right thing, but then behave like self-righteous cunts towards anybody they disagree with while making absolutely no attempt to view things from a different perspective - not even to be able to argue in good faith.

1. Newfoundlanders in general ( not everyone) have no idea how to be inclusive , government has to create programs for that

3. So many remote communities, the infrastructure to support them is so costly and they bring in so much less revenue ( a very sensitive topic but needs to be addressed)
4. The government doesn‚Äôt give a damn about bringing in immigrants, the processes and help we have in other provinces compared to Newfoundland is like an elephant and ant ,no services , no nominations , no vetting people before they come in etc

Some of those items are easy to get. There are no Whole Foods, that being said Amazon should fill in the gaps.

\-Healthy food at specific restaurants, others can recommend better options, St. John's has some good food options but outside of St. John's, it's all deep-fried this and fast food that. It's absolutely not like the food scene in LA.

\-Lots of places to go Hiking. Lot's of outdoor activities during the summer.

\-Alcohol and tobacco/pods are easy to get, keep in mind alcohol sales are state-run, at least for some forms of liquor.

"What I find interesting is that you have one side that asks ""how can we pay for all of these social programs?""  Then they suggest a cut to government revenue like that will make it better.  

I'm not from Newfoundland, I just moved here in February, so I don't have a pulse in local politics yet, but this sentiment is pervasive in my home province of Ontario, where they scrapped the license sticker program eliminating 1 billion in province revenue that the province will have to find else where; that's if it wants the same level of services or they will face cuts. 

How much does 5% in fuel costs affect the lives of people versus the lost revenue, affect federal services.  Do they equal out? I'm assuming not.  The issue is that the pumps are  more forward way of facing the issue rather than the behind the scenes of federal programs.

"I'm not opposed to immigration, we clearly need people to fill some jobs in the Newfoundland economy right now. It is particularly difficult to find people for low-skilled positions and construction/trades. However, the myth of unlimited growth into infinity is toxic and killing the planet and our economy. The only reason we portray population declines or stagnation as being the end of the world is because our entire system is set up like a ponzi scheme and I think that's the bigger issue that needs to be addressed.

The idea that everyone who is non-native is an immigrant presented in this story is also false. You cannot immigrate to a country that does not exist. I agree the treatment of Canada's native people throughout history was wrong, but the abstract construct of Canada as a country you can immigrate to was created out of thin air. Anyone coming to say, Newfoundland, in the late 1700s was just coming to a random landmass in the middle of the ocean that happened to already have people on it, just like the natives that came here thousands of years before that were coming to a random landmass with no one on it. It wasn't Canada at that point. A country is an abstract concept. It isn't something that just exists in nature prior to the establishment of a governing body, infrastructure, etc. The idea that people settling in the woods and building a house out of hand cut timbers a hundred years before any kind of local governing body was established is analogous to immigrating to a country with roads, buildings and a welfare state where you can rent a move in ready apartment within walking distance to a publicly funded school and hospital is foolish.",t2_j3dibpqh,woodchipperthrowaway,0,1648209297.0,0,t1_i21ymxb,i21ymxb,True,BurstYourBubbles,t3_tmxy5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/tmxy5g/immigration_can_be_newfoundland_and_labradors/,Immigration can be Newfoundland and Labrador‚Äôs salvation,/r/newfoundland/comments/tmxy5g/immigration_can_be_newfoundland_and_labradors/i21ymxb/,2,r/newfoundland,0,2

"I rent a basement apartment in my own home and the price of rentals has gone ballistic with the demand far outstripping supply. I had over 150 messages within a three day span trying to find tenants.

I have friends who have immigrated here and because if the price of everything they always have their eyes to Ontario and their home country to paint a better life for their children.

I think if you want to recruit people you can actually retain we should be looking at those who have left.

I, myself, have one foot out the door. I have extensive experience in construction on the tools and as a foreperson with a masters in a related field and I can't get a response from employers.

If you can't find gainful employment or know how much better it can be somewhere else - you're probably not likely to stay. Hebron created a massive boom for population that may have not been seen in the statistics in an accurate way - but almost all those that returned to the province for the work have now left once more.

"**Oops**: So I reached out Sunday night, got an email on Tuesday from economic development. Also got a fast response from economic dev in St. John's. These people are actually on their game. 

Contacted 2 people in economic development to ask about any programs that exist for helping tech companies relocate including to know if any incentives exist. Left 1 phone call, 1 email and 1 linkedin message on Monday without a response. Just followed it up with another linkedin to the other person and and email to the 2nd person. Will give them some time next week to respond. If I don't get any response then I'll lose interest.

As someone that has visited often with friends there, I think Newfoundland should be trying to make itself a more tech friendly place. My personal experience in talking to people in rural areas is they are less aware of how they can make money online doing freelancing work.

There doesn't seem to be much in terms of angel investors to support tech companies and startups and also doesn't seem to be a regional innovation centre (RIC) either. You'll find RICs all over the country especially in Ontario. If anything, Halifax is becoming the go to centre for tech and innovation.

My thoughts are that if the island doesn't change and only relies on more natural resources, then it won't stop younger people from leaving for better opportunities.

Immigration and/or helping adults who moved away but want to come back home seems it would have more of an effect on population growth than babies. At least from a financial standpoint.

My reaction was coming from a place where I'm used to many people not from Newfoundland thinking that we all live in igloos and are stuck in a time warp back to the 1950s or something. 
We have modern amenities here. Grocery stores have aisles that sell the foods you mention as well as other smaller speciality stores. Produce can be diverse at times but not the best quality due to our northern location and the fact Newfoundland is an island. You will notice differences in freshness big time. 
Convenience stores sell beer and *some* coolers. They do not sell wine. 
Wine, beer, liquor are all available from the NLC liquor stores and liquor expresses (smaller versions attached to a few convenience stores/gas stations).
St. John's is not as safe as it used to be at night. In my twenties I bartended in the downtown area and walked home all the time alone (this was 2010s).

We passed.  This was back at the end of Jan and the builder was confident that the home would sell quickly.  It still hasn't sold.

Not defending Trudeau because he has made a lot of unforced errors and he reeks of ‚Äúout of touch elite‚Äù, but if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôve got, you‚Äôve clearly never looked very closely at any other leaders in Canada or the rest of the world.

If you don‚Äôt agree with his policies, vote against. If you think you can do better, run for office, but give your head a shake if you think he‚Äôs the worst we‚Äôve ever had.

"I'll chime in here with some examples of why Trudeau is by far the worst leader Canada has ever seen and how some of their policies have affected my life. Obviously I can't speak for OP but this is my take on it:

WE Charity Scandal

SNC Scandal (in particular booting Jodi Wilson Raybould and Jane Philpott from Caucus for not obeying their master)

Blackface

Dressing up in traditional Indian Clothing and having a family photoshoot in India only to get ridiculed by their leader for doing so

Anti oil bills:

Bill C-48

Bill C-69 - This one in particular is causing me grief right now as Steven Guilbeault is taking full advantage of this and causing delay after delay with decisions on our oil industry. I'm currently working in another country and was (and still am) hoping for Bay du Nord and natural gas platforms to get the green light so I can get a job back home again.

"81k seems like it‚Äôs a quote they gave you as they are busy and need to make it worth their while, unless you have incredibly expensive taste.

I would get more quotes

My basement had subfloor already installed and drywall done and primed on the walls only. I had a rough in for a bathroom as well. 

My cost all in will be around 20k, but I‚Äôve done 95 percent of the labour. I also didn‚Äôt go with cheap materials.

Looking at my spreadsheet and my prices were tax in:

Electrical parts 600 
24 Pot lights 300 
Lighting 500 
Plumbing parts 600
Vanity 560
Tub plus surround 1350
Shower fixture 350
Faucet 170
Toilet 180
Two pre hung doors 500

Flooring 6000
Baseboard 960
Framing materials 1200
Drywall 1200
Plaster 200
Paint 700
New carpet steps 1200 (installed by them)
Double barn doors 680
IKEA cabinets 1700
Misc 1000-2000 (random trips to HD add up) 

Misc I had a few oddball tools I had to buy I didn‚Äôt think about originally (diamond blade for grinder, copper cutter, violet meter, etc. also things like heaters, towel racks, door knobs. List goes on and on).

If I had to put down the subfloor it would have been another 2k. Wall drywall and plaster probably another 2k max for materials.

If I wanted to do it on the cheap I could have probably saved 20 percent pretty easily. 

Last thing I‚Äôll add is I‚Äôm not in the trades and managed to get it all done through YouTube. Highly recommend The Home Renovision channel. His channel is dedicated to showing homeowners how to do their own work. You can save a lot of money tackling some of the jobs yourself. We paid a local company a lot of money to do a bunch of tile work when we bought this house. It was a disaster and I‚Äôve done as good or better tile work since.

"The other day, someone on twitter likened world oil consumption to the ""war on drugs"". 

If you concentrate on eliminating the supply (cancel Bay du Nord etc) supply will only crop up elsewhere (Russia, Saudi, Venezuela etc.). The same way there's always a new source of drugs, new channels for import, and new street level drug dealers. 

You need to concentrate on demand. If you stop demand, the supply will stop itself. Carbon Taxes, incentives for oil replacement etc will lower demand for oil the same way that providing supports for the end user will get people off drugs. 

Stopping Bay Du Nord, shutting down Alberta Oil, hell... even closing the Gulf of Mexico would do nothing to stop people from driving gas cars, cruise ships from burning Bunker C and companies from using refined products to manufacture everything.

Trying to develop wind power at the moment wouldn't make any sense.

I see that as a whole separate issue from BdN.

We need to transition away from O&G, but in the meantime companies like Equinor will be developing O&G projects. We need oil as long as things like airlines, cruise ships, tankers, manufacturing plants exist. Third world countries can't afford to upgrade their infrastructure to accompdate renewable energy. If equinor don't do a project here, they'll go do a project in Africa or Brazil where environmental regulations are much more relaxed. Why wouldn't we develop a project here to lower our dependency on oil from places like Russia and other dictatorships.

We could mandate mining and wind platform work be done on renewables. We could spur agriculture that is regenerative. We could fast track green energy companies into Labrador that work equitably. Maybe making iron air batteries, or processing aluminum, maybe carbon free steel etc.

We could do a lot of things but they are hard. The longer we wait the worst things will be when we are FORCED to try.

If we set the stage as the place along the Atlantic Ocean with cheap renewable energy, plenty of space, in an area that according to the worst climate models, might survive even RCP8.5, then we get ahead of the game and reap the rewards.

">Dude, you are claiming housing is going to crash by half. I am asking you to explain why. You are just saying ""It's a bubble"" over and over again without showing how. Take this latest chart you posted. Ok, it shows the 10-year-bond rate. It shows it spiked in the 80s. It shows we are at near historical lows. Even if that returns to a historically normal level, it is not going to cut house prices in half. That giant spike in the 1980s did not come close to cutting house prices in half.

I am trying to be patient, this is painful for me because of the depth of my understanding, but I want you to understand because there might be things you can do to help you and your loved ones as we enter into this difficult stage (if you can understand). When you are discussing economic matters, the gravity of each term you are discussing has to be measured. The gravity of the bond market is for example extremely serious. How government works is not that they tax people and distribute that taxed money; that would be pointless. Rather they have a tax base which they can reliably extract taxes from and then they go to the bond market and they say, this is how much money we can get to pay back loans and its safe because we are a big first world province with lots of resources. 

So 40 years of lower and lower rates (bullish in the case of bonds) cannot go any lower, it can not go below 0 wherein the bank starts sending a cheque to people for having a mortgage. But that is where all the economic growth is coming from (the stock market has an inverse correlation to the 10 year bond over those 40 years).

The only way to respond to market crisis is to turn on the money printer, since bonds have hit that floor of 0, which sends inflation spiraling (we are seeing the early signs, a pack of burgers was what, 16 dollars, now its like 32). Interest rates rise to soak up all the excess money floating around.

This does NOT mean we enter into Weimar or Venezuela style hyperinflation. That is hyperbole. We would stop eventually. But this leads to us being stagnant in a worse than Great Depression style environment since global debt is at 300 trillion, we have quadrillions in toxic derivatives in our current markets, and we will have a very high interest rate environment. This is worsened greatly by ecological controls which are antithetical to the machinery of the economy.

You really can't use past charts because we are in uncharted territory.

You are like John Cabot sailing to Newfoundland here using maps of Europe. What you keep trying to do is useless. You need to develop the ability to forecast, which is to look ahead. The ability to forecast is not the same as having a map; forecasts are best guesses.

>I moved into town from my hometown when the fishery collapsed and everyone in my family lost their jobs, so I think a know a little something about economic hardship. Unless you are over the age of 80, you have not experienced an economic event more cataclysmic as that in Newfoundland, because you'd have to go back to pre-WWII.

Something worse then that is going to happen because the fishery collapsed in a highly favorable economic environment. Newfoundlanders made out quite well in the last 20-30 years. It's going to be bad to the point where you have to grow your own food, raise your own chickens, goats etc. Our urban townie environment can probably accommodate this, peoples backyards and frontyards are big enough to raise a good bit of food. 

Again depending on how the pandemic goes etc, will determine much of how the future looks like. I'm actually painting the best case scenario here, severe economic hardship (10 years from now) with potential hyperconflict. 

I'm not being entirely clear here, this will come in two stages. 1 being quite soon, another being 10 years out. So housing prices here will get hammered soon, then gradually get worn down over the next decade, bottoming out 10ish years from now. But they will get hammered pretty good here shortly.

"Dude, you are claiming housing in St. John's is going to crash by half. I am asking you to explain why. You are just saying ""It's a bubble"" over and over again without showing how. Take this latest chart you posted. Ok, it shows the 10-year-bond rate. It shows it spiked in the 80s. It shows we are at near historical lows. Even if that returns to a historically normal level, it is not going to cut house prices in half. That giant spike in the 1980s did not come close to cutting house prices in half.

[Look, here is a list of median US house going back to **1953**.](https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/) That's 70 years of data. There was no massive pullback when interest rates were high. There was no massive pullback when inflation was high. It dips by maybe 10-20% during the great recession and recovers.

[Even in the great depression they dropped by around 35%,](https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-and-education-magazines/housing-1929-1941) not half, and again in that situation there was a clear run up of prices leading up to the crash.

You are making a huge claim here that house prices in St. John's are going to be cut in half. All I'm asking you to do is to show something to back up that claim and you just attack me and say, ""Even muh daddy knows this."" Will housing pull back eventually? Sure.  Do I think the markets in many areas are overheated? Sure. Some areas have seen 100% year-over-year growth and prices are well above inflation adjusted historical norms. Do I think the market in St. John's are due for such a severe correction, they will be cut in half? Nope. Gains in the St. John's market have barely outpaced inflation and you have yet to provide any numbers demonstrating it why such a pullback would occur. Houses and land have inherent value. They are not stocks or bonds or cryptocurrency. They are tied to their real world utility and that generally makes a floor for prices.

">It does not show housing prices being cut in half by inflation.

I don't know what to tell you buddy. It's the most irritable sort of argument style to try and win. The time period from 1950-1970 is very very different from the late stage period of 1980-2020. I mean I can bring up charts all day. You might be in your late 20s or 30s, the bond market has been in a secular bull market your entire life:

https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart

In many ways you've never known hardship. The TV commercials have always had toys, consumer products etc on them. And that is different from before 1980, consumerism never had taken off to such an extent. 

>Where is the evidence? Show me. Show me some charts specific to Newfoundland GDP, incomes and the housing market and explain how it's a bubble. Show me the bubble being inflated. Saying your old man who is uneducated agrees with you doesn't exactly inspire confidence in your argument.

At this point I think that you have a house and have a lot on the line, that is not the kind of argument I wanted to get into. I wanted to get into a basic intellectual theoretical argument (on a touchy subject). There are no charts for the future because the future hasn't happened yet. But you are what I would call complacent on this subject. 

I don't want to particularly spend a lot of time looking up charts but I do have data points. When my parents were shopping for houses in the early 80s they paid around 60k for a house that is worth around 200k today. Markets love to go and retest old bottoms. 

>So you're making shit up and not presenting any evidence for it, and when someone asks you for evidence you're saying ""No you don't get it. This is some doomsday shit like we've never seen before. Here is some Bitcoin doomer shit."" Cool.

This is how you can view the world if you don't want to get educated. Fossil fuels, the bond markets, etc, these are the things educated me is pointed to that indicate massive problems in the world that we can't put under the rug.

>Look dude, if we have a complete financial collapse along with hyper inflation to the point you are talking about no one is going to be worried about house prices. People are going to kick in your door and kill you and take your shit. Your Bitcoin isn't going to save you.

Now you are engaging in hyperbole. No one did that during the Great Depression. I watched a video on the depression featuring Jerry Stiller and he said back then, all the men felt guilty, even though it wasn't their fault. Jerry said he knew a guy who went and hanged himself because he couldn't get a job, and he teared up.

So one time when mom was away from home at mealtime (which was a very unusual situation in itself), and us kids were desperate for supper, dad took some of those pizzas out of the freezer, found a pan, figured out how to turn on the oven, and popped them in.

Witless Bay is a prime example.  people have been fighting the current council for years over some common house developments that has no bearing on what they want to stop.  and a few people dont want a road near their property etc.. all small town BS.

Now the new councill are many of those people who was against the previous councill and are doing everything to stop certian developments because they dont like certian people making it personal or putting their own agenda in place.

I guess many towns are the same once councill gets in they run their own agenda,  but I hope regionilization comes in effect sooner than later,  to cut down on these ways.

This is just a blatant ignorance of history. Interest rates did go up in the late 1970s. Banks wouldnt loan to big companies like airlines. They were so desperate for cash that they offered lifetime flights for 250k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fcH6-WQUAw

They definitely werent giving out loans for houses like they were today

"Long answer, so bare with me...

You'll see most of the crew changes by helicopter.

Reduced capacity isn't an issue, they'll just make more flights.

Change by boat is usually a last resort even in the existing oilfields, usually they'll just make a second or third attempt on a helicopter, often once it gets to the point you're changing by boat, you've got two more flights worth of crew changing on the boat.

Not sure what you mean by a day and a half by boat to ""help""?

All installations are required to have a ""stand-by"" boat in the field at all times, they're there for fire fighting, evacuation, etc.

Depending on the installation, there's usually more around as well, usually an ROV intervention vessel, and there may be a supply vessel or two (though they could also be anywhere between there and st. Johns moving cargo/passengers)

There also resource sharing agreements in place between the operators, so, all the installations have supply boats assisting them, if one of them had an emergency (say worst case, a fire or sinking, or another helicopter crash), any extra boats from the other installations would be immediately tasked to help.

Fueling supply boats isn't an issue, they wouldn't be fueling mid way, they usually take fuel once every month or two, they can make multiple trips out and back no problem, they deliver fuel to the installations.

Fueling helicopters isn't a huge issue either, they can carry extended tanks or they can fuel mid way, though, fueling mid way requires you're able to land, and that's often an issue due to fog.

Like I said, I wouldn't be surprised if high speed boat crew changes were a thing, normal supply boats are relatively slow.

Fast crew boats in the gulf regularly travel double or triple speed what normal supply boats travel, and are often used when working beyond helicopter range.

The major trade off being they can't carry much or any cargo, and they're not suitable in rough weather (we have a lot of rough weather)

The logistics of the field really aren't a show stopper as long as the price of oil is high enough, and even the extra cost of transit is minor compared to the overall cost of the field.

It would definitely be more expensive to operate than the existing fields, but the existing fields are also profitable at prices well below what oil is trading at now.",t2_6wlvg,TheCapedMoosesader,0,1647979071.0,0,t1_i1pcpq8,i1pcpq8,False,Proof_Device_8197,t3_tk5dqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/tk5dqn/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_bay_du_nord_project/,What Are Your Thoughts on the Bay Du Nord Project?,/r/newfoundland/comments/tk5dqn/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_bay_du_nord_project/i1pcpq8/,3,r/newfoundland,0,3

"The logistics of getting supplies out aren't any more complicated than any of the other fields, it's just further.

It's about a half day sailing by supply boat from St. John's to the existing fields, it's about a day and a half to bay du nord.

Supply ships have also gotten progressively larger but also more fuel efficient over the years, so the distance isn't a show stopper.

Moving people isn't really an issue either, you'd just need more flights to move the same number of flights.

May actually be easier, as the Flemish pass isn't as affected by fog as the grand banks is, so you'd have less fog delays/boomerangs.

"I would prefer if the project came with the decommissioning of a worst extraction project and guaranteed refining and usage within Canada. We should be using our own fuel instead of getting it from some nutter petrostate.

For example if we remove some tar sands. Alberta tar sands EROI is like 3:1 and ours is 25-50:1: that means we use way less energy to extract the same amount of future energy.

End of the day, the more we promote O&G the longer people will think it is fine to continue burning it. We just can't continue. I don't buy the 'if we don't someone else will' argument. The easy access fuel is dwindling. If we let supply constrain as the world moves away from O&G, we could make more money holding onto it.

">That is a common false belief. Housing prices are based on people's ability to borrow money. It's actually not complex to understand. Interest rates in 1980 were high so housing prices were low. 

Show me the data. Show me where interest rates went up and house prices got cut in half.

Even in the [great recession in the US](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS), when the US economic system was collapsing, median house prices did not get cut in half.

>OK so why are you so optimistic. 

Literally all I'm saying is there is no evidence of a housing bubble in Newfoundland. I'm not saying prices are going to the moon. I'm not even saying they will continue to rise unabated. Housing prices may very well go down. I have said this multiple times. It's the amount you are claiming housing in Newfoundland is going to go down that is the issue. All I've argued is it's extremely unlikely they will get to the point where you are getting a move in ready townhouse for $50k because there is little evidence of a bubble in Newfoundland and there are several factors that would establish a floor in the market above that. You made the claim that $160k houses are going to drop to $50-80k multiple times now and have yet to provide any logic or evidence to back it up. Like can they drop to $120, maybe even $110? Sure. However, you're claiming there's going a massive drop in Newfoundland that's unprecedented in Canadian history. [For example, in the 1989 crash in Ontario, houses dropped 34%.](https://www.readthepeak.com/blog/housing-market-crash-canada) [In Japan's lost decade, they dropped by around 45% over 10 or so years.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QJPN628BIS) In both those cases, there was a huge spike in prices leading up to the crashes indicating a bubble. You're claiming that we're in for 50-70% drop with a $160k townhouse going down to $50-80k with little evidence of a bubble as prices have been relatively stable. Again, if you have some stats or evidence feel to back up this claim, feel free to present it.

>I think I am being realistic when I am painting a dark picture.

"> That's not really the point. Minimum wage is about to go to $13.40 an hour. The point is even with an interest rate of like 7-8% two people working full time minimum wage at $13.40 can get approved for a mortgage in the low $100k range. Housing is very unlikely to drop further once it reaches a level where even the people with the most bullshit, low paying jobs can afford to buy a house. Minimum wage creates a floor in the market.

I was approved for something in the 150k range off one income & my wife makes more than me, but that is actually the problem. And some of the houses in that range aren't even that bad. But the problem is that I got approved. When rates go up I would not have been able to make the payments. And of course as soon as rates go up, what you just said becomes untrue because of course minimum wage people would not be able to make the payments. You have not found any trick here that mortgage advisors can't figure out; they are going to calculate your cost of living. If cost of living goes up, the amount they are going to permit you for a mortgage is going to be more conservative. Not to mention the higher interest payments that you wouldn't be able to make.

>You're saying things that contradict each other. If the government turns on the money printer and we get runaway inflation, house prices will shoot up, not down, because money is worth less. Saying ""The government is going to turn on the money printer and house prices will get cut in half"" literally doesn't make sense. Having assets like property is traditionally a hedge against inflation, because they have an inherent value.

That is a common false belief. Housing prices are based on people's ability to borrow money. It's actually not complex to understand. Interest rates in 1980 were high so housing prices were low. You'd be more likely to save up cash in a savings account (with a high interest rate paid to YOU) and buy a house in cash. Nowadays it's easy to loan large amounts of money and just about anyone can do it, so housing prices go up. But as things revert to the mean, that puts all those people in a highly unfavorable position (there is still time to get out).

>You called housing a bubble. Now you're saying we missed out on the bubble and that's not good. lol?

If you sell at the top of the bubble, that's good for you is it not? Am I painting a pretty picture here, I thought I was describing hell.

>Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? The entire Newfoundland economy has collapsed multiple times now. Like, you can't get much closer to a total economic collapse than Newfoundland in the early 90s. The fishery closing was the biggest mass layoff in Canadian history, unemployment went over 20%, still a record in Canada, and around 50,000 left the province over the course of 10 years. Newfoundland's net debt to GDP was worse in the 1990s than it is now. The amount of debt per person is a huge problem, but in terms of debt as a percentage of GDP, we have actually been in much worse shape before.

OK so why are you so optimistic. I think I am being realistic when I am painting a dark picture.

"I will share my experience trying to get a new build.  It depends on the builder and your asking these questions up front.

Things like glue and screwing floors can be factored in, as can plywood exterior sheeting.  Although I will tell you that I have several builder's appendix that state that OSB or plywood would be used and is up to the builder's discretion.

Roof shingles are a big concern.  A builder's rep asked me specifically why I wanted metal open valleys on the roof as they don't install them that way.  When I replied that was required by the shingle manufacturer it was met by silence from the builder.  When I also noted that the manufacturer also has specific requirements for high wind installation that was also met by silence.  

When I brought up smart home features to a builder the response was built in ceiling speakers.  I personally don't know why any homeowner would want that today with so many small portable wireless speakers are on the market.  And of course, that has nothing to do with creating a smart home.

When discussing windows and whether 3 pane versus 2 pane, I replied that 2 pane is okay as I believe the ROI on 3 pane is simply too long.  OK, said the builder.  I replied but Energy Star certified 2 pane and the response was, ""OK, I will make sure to quote for that.""  This is just an example to make sure you know exactly what you are asking.

Personally, I am hesitant to select a builder who constructs to minimal code and then try and have them build above that.  That builder just does not have the experience building to that standard.  Is it smart to have a builder who only builds damp proof basements to expect them to install a water proof basement system?

"This ""pay your fair share"" is a slippery slope when it comes to taxes because it's inherently regressive.

I consume an average amount of services here in the province.  I also pay 2-3x in income taxes compared to the provincial average.   Do I pay my fair share?   I make a lot of money but I only do so because I've worked my ass off since I was 14. (No silver spoon here, I grew below the poverty line).  Is my fair share higher because I sacrificed leisure time to work when I was younger?  I certainly pay far more for the provincial services I receive than most people.   

Even when it comes to property taxes, it's a lousy argument.   You take two houses.  Same frontage, same square footage, same size family living in one.    One family decides to spend their weekends and disposable income making their house nicer.  Property value gets re-evaluated, goes up and suddenly all the services they pay for are more expensive than the other guys.    They still paying their fair share?    Or even better:  One family does nothing but their neighbors do.  Now they pay more for services because of it. What's their fair share?

Your example also totally sidesteps my point.

"We've been down this road thirty years ago when amalgamation was the buzzword, and we welded together dozens of communities into single municipalities. Everything that wasn't done then was left undone for a reason. As others have said, this is going to be a tax grab in exchange for minimal services. It's not going to change the reality that these regions have to cover large swaths of land with small populations, many of which are providing their own limited services.

I do think regionalization will help with some issues. It's getting harder and harder to get municipal councillors in small towns, and there's no budget for some important jobs that could perhaps be filled if the responsibilities were coordinated. Have a look at the provincial list of boil order advisories - there are towns that have been on boil orders for longer than some redditors have been alive. Some of those arise simply because there's nobody who can maintain the existing water treatment system.

A person who is barely making ends meet, which is a lot of people these days, having to spend out of pocket for at least two rapid tests that may or may not work is crazy.

When the decision is to use $40 towards keeping a roof over your head or food in the cupboard, vs paying for covid tests because you have a sniffle, then people aren't going to be testing themselves..

">min wage doesnt keep up with inflation

That's not really the point. Minimum wage is about to go to $13.40 an hour. The point is even with an interest rate of like 7-8% two people working full time minimum wage at $13.40 can get approved for a mortgage in the low $100k range. Housing is very unlikely to drop further once it reaches a level where even the people with the most bullshit, low paying jobs can afford to buy a house. Minimum wage creates a floor in the market.

>when the bond market is in bear market territory then the money printer is the only way to go, which increases inflation, which increases interest rates

You're saying things that contradict each other. If the government turns on the money printer and we get runaway inflation, house prices will shoot up, not down, because money is worth less. Saying ""The government is going to turn on the money printer and house prices will get cut in half"" literally doesn't make sense. Having assets like property is traditionally a hedge against inflation, because they have an inherent value. 

>i mean, you pointed to our stagnant housing market as being a positive.

I didn't point it out as a positive. I pointed to it as evidence the market isn't overheated.

>we missed out on the housing bull run that big cities experienced; thats not good and we can still go down

You called housing a bubble. Now you're saying we missed out on the bubble and that's not good. lol?

>we've never been here before economically so you can't say we wont have huge unemployment, literally unprescedented. 1929 had more prescident

Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? The entire Newfoundland economy has collapsed multiple times now. Like, you can't get much closer to a total economic collapse than Newfoundland in the early 90s. The fishery closing was the biggest mass layoff in Canadian history, unemployment went over 20%, still a record in Canada, and around 50,000 left the province over the course of 10 years. [Newfoundland's net debt to GDP was worse in the 1990s than it is now.](http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/canadian-fiscal/prov_fiscal.pdf) The amount of debt per person is a huge problem, but in terms of debt as a percentage of GDP, we have actually been in much worse shape before.

"I have been finishing my basement since mid January. Prices are ridiculous. Every time I went for lumber run you can see increases (on what we‚Äôre already at high levels)

"I've been months getting quotes on a new build in the St. John's area.  Looking at building a bungalow.  Quotes ranged from $253 sq/ft to $390 sq ft including land cost.

If you check out the prices of new builds listed on [Realtor.ca](https://Realtor.ca) you will find many are priced from $260 - $380 sq ft.  This includes the land cost and no finished basement.

Several things I have discovered in the process:

1. Build quality is low.  Most builders construct to minimal building code.  This means damp proof and not water proof basements and minimal insulation levels for instance,
2. Most builders quote allowances for things like kitchens, baths, flooring and fireplace.  These amounts tend to be on the low side,
3. With reference to insulation levels, it is very difficult to find a builder that will build an energy efficient home to the Energy Star or R2000 level.  I find this amazing considering the high costs of home heating in NL & Lab,
4. Many builders who install laminated fiberglass roof shingles do not install them to the manufacturer's install directions.  This will void the manufacturer's warranty on your new roof,
5. Most municipalities do not require builders to complete their subdivisions in a timely manner and allow them to leave open lots for years and years.  Look at Southlands, for instance.  Many home buyers there have been living with rock pits all around their homes for years,
6. Builder Appendix's are woefully lacking in detail.  It will be difficult for you to have a clear understanding of what you are getting from a builder's appendix,
7. Make sure that you verify all facts.  We have repeatedly run into an issue where things that are advertised are not in fact what you are getting when you start digging.  I'm talking about things like an advertised lot size being smaller or completely different when you review the actual survey for the lot.  New builds being advertised with features that are not actually in the build.  Floor plans advertised for the build are not what are actually built.  We have encountered these issues so many times that we have decided to take a break from our search as we feel we cannot trust that what they advertise and say is what we will receive in the end,

"No, it's your job to preserve your own life always. Full stop period.  That holds true when you're walking across a parking lot, on the job or driving a car. 

You are literally the only one ultimately responsible for your safety.  If you run behind 5000lbs of moving steel driving backwards you're an idiot.  

Pedestrians should have their head on a swivel anywhere, especially in parking lots. Having the right of way is cold comfort to your family when you're dead. 

Drivers have a responsibility to drive carefully and watch out diligently for pedestrians, dogs, other cars, shopping carts, and basically everything else you might squish with a car but sightlines aren't perfect and lighting often leaves something to be desired.   

Cars have reverse lights that come on when the car is shifted to reverse. If you walk behind a car that has those lights on, you're a moron. You have effectively walked into traffic. Bravo. 

If a car is driving down the road and you walk out in front of it, would you figure the driver did something wrong?  Why is it somehow different when the driver is in a parking lot? How hard is it to understand that you don't walk in front of moving vehicles?

"min wage doesnt keep up with inflation

interest rates will easily reach 10%. when the bond market is in bear market territory then the money printer is the only way to go, which increases inflation, which increases interest rates

st johns is generally the poorest statistically in anything you can think of, i mean, you pointed to our stagnant housing market as being a positive. we missed out on the housing bull run that big cities experienced; thats not good and we can still go down

gas is relevant when we start reaching extreme pricing. like where 10 dollars worth of gas doesn't get you to your job. we've only just begun

comfortable paying 80k because its all they can afford in the future, maybe, depending on what happens

I don't see how this is particularly relevant. We've always paid more for gas. If you look at the chart I posted earlier and compare it to your chart, gas prices do not seem to particularly influence housing prices. 

>but overall structurally, i think people would be far more comfortable paying like 80k for a house that is asking 160k today, as the entire interest rate environment changes. not to mention fuel/heating oil costs.

Well, no shit, ""People will be more comfortable paying less for something they need.""

>we have a tax and spend government on both provincial and municipal level with much higher % employed via government

>as such they heavily rely on the bond market which we were recently laughed out of because we're not big like ontario and we have less of a market

I don't disagree, but that's not going to cause a $160k townhouse to drop to $50k. As the price declines there will be too much demand at that end of the market for it to reach $50k. Like, once we hit the low $100s, we're in a territory where a couple working full time at McDonald's can comfortably afford it. People from the mainland will start buying up houses just to own something if prices on a decent townhouse drop below $100k. There's an inbuilt floor due to lower prices increasing demand.


>if we get into a high unemployment situation, more likely to see like 50k with people selling just to get out of here. a lot of these houses have tenant renting bottom, one person in the house with a good job, one with a crap job, just to pay the mortgage. and thats with young people mind you. if the tenant moves out, if the person with the big job gets laid off, or if interest rates go up a lot, that is earth shaking and produces sell pressure

"some of these houses that are asking 160k today are probably only worth 50-80k. i mean they are asking over 150k for an acre of land in logy bay, it's a joke. 

you are pointing to ""stability"" but our gas prices have so much variance and an unfavorable curvature where we generally pay more compared to our neighbors

https://i.ibb.co/NKQL8kw/chrome-E7j-Yf-Oy-Dn-S.png

we have a tax and spend government on both provincial and municipal level with much higher % employed via government

as such they heavily rely on the bond market which we were recently laughed out of because we're not big like ontario and we have less of a market

its going to be a complex combination of factors at work, not to mention that strong rallies in gold and oil will definitely counteract the forces bringing our housing prices down

but overall structurally, i think people would be far more comfortable paying like 80k for a house that is asking 160k today, as the entire interest rate environment changes. not to mention fuel/heating oil costs.

"I can answer this: 
It really depends which store your placement is at that determines how much notice you get before being called. The busier stores like howley estates and kenmount will call you the day-of, sometimes an hour before. Other stores will give you a heads up saying for example ‚Äúwe have a shift on *this day* available and wondering if you want to take it‚Äù. 

The guaranteed number of shifts each week is determined by how many hours your position is allotted to. So if you have a 20 hour per pay period position, you will most likely get two 5 hour shifts a week for your guaranteed hours with the possibility of being called for extra shifts that aren‚Äôt necessarily part of your schedule.
