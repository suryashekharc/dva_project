They aren't. They can't, and won't, intervene in something just because its on their property. They'll just call the police and let it play out.

So stick to police stations for meetings. The only reason to go to a bank, is much farther in the process of selling a car (e.g. verifying payment/funds and/or withdrawing and handing cash on the spot).

"Exactly right. The police are very well funded everywhere and it's obviously barely a fucking deterrent, especially in cities with huge income inequality. These are career criminals with no other options. The police are reactionary anyway. If he calls 911 the second he got there, would they have arrived in time to stop it? Unless we're under a fucking 24/7 police state, throwing more money and officers at the problem isn't going to fix it.

Does that mean close police stations overnight and send out social workers with clipboards? Of course not. But it's equally idiotic for people to think the solution is to do more of what got us here.

We're experiencing late stage capitalism and there is no easy solution. Seems that treating people like disposable resources and corporations like people isn't quite working out. There has to be a middle ground somewhere

Arguably, Caltrain electrification *and* a Caltrain bridge is also required but the state (justifiably) doesn't trust Caltrain's owner with $25 billion needed to rebuild the latter. This is part and parcel of the larger statewide project, because there is no way HSR can work without Caltrain's involvement.

">The only reason to keep that information from the police is if Choi was actually involved with the organization of the jump.

First of all, you don't have evidence that Alex knows the driver. You made an assumption.

&#x200B;

Second, even if Alex did know who the driver was, and lied, that doesn't mean you can immediately jump to the conclusion that Alex organized the event. 

I know logic is hard when you practice mob law, but try to keep up.

&#x200B;

What is entirely possible is that someone told Alex and his list of goons that someone was planning on jumping a tesla, and Alex was like hell yeah, content, and went to the location to film. This doesn't mean he organized the jump. Why is there so much rage towards Alex instead of the actual dude was thought it was a good idea to jump a Tesla with a cat inside?

Unfortunately also, normal angelinos work 9-5 and don't have the luxury of keyboard warrioring into every county BOS meeting occurring in the middle of the afternoon.

"> You couldn't explain why ""you can't force people to accept help"" is a lie. You went off on a nonsense tangent that didn't address the comment. You literally diverted into something that wasn't even addressed.

Because it is not what I was talking about. You are cherry-picking. I have implied since the very first post and clarified explicitly in the second post about this. You keep going back to this point which means *absolutely nothing* in this discussion.

> This is where you didn't read correctly. He wasn't assuming a specific person didn't want help. He is addressing in general that you cannot force to take your help if they did not want help at all. This is where you went psycho and not even understand what they're trying to say. Colebrv went into detail of his response but you didn't even bother read it. It's a fact if you ask someone 100 time ""do you want help"" and everytime they say no. You cannot force them to take your help when they don't want it. Idk how hard it is to grasp this concept. This is a true fact not a lie.

> Are you seriously saying you can force someone to get help?

> Areyu saying you can force someone to accept help. Yes or no?

> Seriously it's a yes or no question. Can you force someone to accept your help. Yes or no. Not hard to answer.

">Can we agree this is where I started and what I was talking about, or do your facts differ from what everyone on the internet can see?

You couldn't explain why ""you can't force people to accept help"" is a lie. You went off on a nonsense tangent that didn't address the comment. You literally diverted into something that wasn't even addressed. 

>In this context, you can clearly see I am arguing against the assumption this person made about homeless people who do not want help.

This is where you didn't read correctly. He wasn't assuming a specific person didn't want help. He is addressing in general that you cannot force to take your help if they did not want help at all. This is where you went psycho and not even understand what they're trying to say. Colebrv went into detail of his response but you didn't even bother read it. It's a fact if you ask someone 100 time ""do you want help"" and everytime they say no. You cannot force them to take your help when they don't want it. Idk how hard it is to grasp this concept. This is a true fact not a lie.

Are you seriously saying you can force someone to get help?

>It is easy to say so many homeless people do not want help and you cannot force them into help because it puts the burden on them instead of on society. 

Areyu saying you can force someone to accept help. Yes or no?

>You cannot reach the point in the argument of forcing homeless people to get help without the premise of that there are homeless people out there who do not want help.

So are you agreeing that you can't force someone to get help?

Seriously it's a yes or no question. Can you force someone to accept your help. Yes or no.

"After reading for a couple hours, I am humbled how complex wind is. 

I think I understood why wind might blow towards the east inland into the LA basin from the ocean. I assume winds always blow towards a lower pressure area, in any direction. If the land heats up during the day, the air at low elevations heats up as well, creating an upwards draft and thus creating a low pressure system. 

Is this correct so far? I am already somewhat doubtful because I thought that a higher temperature itself could create more pressure, as air molecules would be vibrating faster. Perhaps this is outweighed by the effect of the hot air rising upwards (to lower pressure upper atmosphere) and being replaced by the cooler air from the ocean (to replace lower pressure inland air). At any rate, moving on. 

The lower pressure system created over the LA basin creates winds eastward because the air pressure over the oceans is higher. The reason it's higher is that the ocean doesn't heat up as much and thus the air over it stays cooler, and thus doesn't rise as much as it does over land. This air moves eastward and reduces that pressure over the water and increases the pressure over the land. 

What I don't understand is why the wind often blows westward instead. I suppose the Santa Ana winds in the winter that blow westward offer one explanation, but I don't fully understand. The air normally very cold at night east of Los Angeles where there are deserts and the air is very dry. In the morning, the sun heats up the land and this air rises over the mountains that surround LA and go towards LA. The air over LA is also warming during the winter, but rather than being replaced by air from the ocean as is more the case during the summer, it is being replaced by the air from the east. This occurs because the ocean doesn't cool overall as much as the desert land does during the winter, thus the temp *increase* during the daytimes for the air over the desert is *greater* than that over the ocean, which means that there is more of a low pressure system created over the desert areas. The air the replaces that in the desert comes from further east and the west is blocked by mountains? 

I'm getting very hand wavy at this point. None of this explains what would happen at night where ground temperatures cool off even more in the desert areas. Would the winds then blow eastward again overnight? I don't really have this data except this seasonal data: [https://weatherspark.com/y/1705/Average-Weather-in-Los-Angeles-California-United-States-Year-Round#Figures-WindDirection](https://weatherspark.com/y/1705/Average-Weather-in-Los-Angeles-California-United-States-Year-Round#Figures-WindDirection).
