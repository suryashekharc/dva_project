"We have a pretty active Facebook neighbourhood group but it has its usual shenanigans. Our kids really enjoy the programs and swimming mentioned above. 

Other programs include the public library, Early Years centres, toddler time at Go Bananas, little leapers time at Sky Zone, funvilla, and play-a-latte. 

In the fall there are tons of farms around such as Shantz, Benjamin tree farm, Steckley’s, Seilings, and Sniders.

For food, I find family friendly options include Boston pizza, graffiti market, Descendants brewery (seriously), and Fireside Deli.

If you need childcare, I suggest you register with Waterloo OneList asap and start contacting home daycares and centres asap. DM me if you need more info. 

Lots of great splash pads and parks including Huron natural area, Victoria park, and Waterloo park which also has animals like peacocks and llamas.

"Kiwanis park has a nice climber, and a really lovely outdoor pool that's perfect for tiny humans in the summer. 

Victoria park has a great playground, a splash pad, *public bathrooms*, and a population of Canada geese who should be given plenty of space. 

Waterloo park (technically not Kitchener, but easily accessible) has animals in the summer, and ongoing construction if your kiddos like excavators. 

Kitchener public library offers a great service online called Billy's Books, where you tell the librarian your kid's age/interests, and they'll make you a custom pile of books.

The Kitchener farmer's market has great prices for produce, and is a great Saturday morning jaunt. 

You'll get a transit pass with your student ID, and your kiddos will ride free. Transit is okay-but-not-fabulous.

"Hey, it sounds like you're really feeling frustrates with how the world works lately. I can certainly empathize with that, considering how polarizing some media can make the world feel. You probably feel isolated after your decision to not get vaccinated.

So you come to reddit to share in the community, but get downvoted just for giving your opinion - it must make you feel frustrated! But I'd like to take a moment and lend you a helping hand.

The facts and opinions that you're sharing have been debunked by fact-checkers. Some opinions are even harmful to share (like anti-vaccination sentiments) since they can misinform others into making decisions that could be harmful to their bodies. 

I'm not here to judge you for your decisions, though! You're a member of the same community as I am, and I just want to help a neighbour in KW. 

It seems that you have been misinformed about certain topics, likely from the news, social media, or your personal acquaintances. This is unfortunate, but there is a skill that you can learn to defend yourself in the future:

"Fingers crossed that this happens.

Not sure if this story tells anything in favor of FlixBus keeping up with the cheapness in Canada, but here it goes. In 1931 Germany enacted a law which outlawed long distance domestic bus transport in favor of Deutsche Bahn (German Railways). It pretty much gave monopoly to Deutsche Bahn over entire passenger transportation within Germany (here's one article ranting about it from 2010: [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/business/global/10bus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/business/global/10bus.html)). I think that the ban was lifted a year after, in 2011 ([https://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/germany-lifts-ban-on-long-distance-bus-trips/](https://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/germany-lifts-ban-on-long-distance-bus-trips/)). That same year, FlixBus was founded in Munich to finally be able to provide long distance bus transport in Germany. I moved to Germany in 2012 and from the beginning of their operations in Germany I recall that prices were really low. At the beginning, there were I think 3 operators next to them who were fighting in this (funny enough, but) new market for Germany. 10 years later I think that the FlixBus was the only one which survived and in all the honesty I am not sure if they have any competition right now in Germany. Still, the prices remained pretty low and decent and I never noticed any increase even though they were crushing the competition and becoming absolutely dominant company (at least in Germany) for this type of transportation.",t2_13pbni,uerceg,0,1648159205.0,0,t1_i1zkecc,i1zkecc,False,WhisperingSideways,t3_tmx8qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchener/comments/tmx8qm/new_bus_operator_to_offer_trips_between_kitchener/,New bus operator to offer trips between Kitchener and Toronto,/r/kitchener/comments/tmx8qm/new_bus_operator_to_offer_trips_between_kitchener/i1zkecc/,4,r/kitchener,0,4

"I'm late to this topic but I  moved to New Hamburg 9 months ago after living in Kitchener my whole life. 

Pros: 

the kids at school are nicer and relatively younger (meaning they talk about sex and drugs less and there have been no fights at school, which used to happen in Kitchener) and therefore my kids have more friends that they can relate to (not just grew up with). 

K-6 in Kitchener was great and I loved the diversity, but 7/8 was a different ball game entirely. So yes, a little more racist/homophobic in New Hamburg (although they existed in different ways in Kitchener, too) and the misogyny was way worse in 7/8 schools in Kitchener - sexually inappropriate comments and bullying by the boys to the girls. 

Sports teams. Most of the kids you play with go to your school so great for making friends. Parents and families are nice. Kitchener hockey was less of a community and there were no kids who played at my child's school. 

I've had friendly neighbours in both cities but generally everyone waves hello in New Hamburg. 

It also has most of what I need here: groceries, restaurants, LCBO, Service Canada, LifeLabs, Dentists, physiotherapy. And it's right off the highway which makes it super close to Boardwalk and Sunrise and even Conestoga Mall doesn't take that long compared with, say Beechwood. Lots of convenient gas stations and no long lines for anything! No more clothing stores since Murray's closed but Boardwalk and Sunrise Plaza (both of which have Walmarts). Plus, online shopping ships just as quickly to New Hamburg as Kitchener :) 

It's beautiful. Lots of nature, bigger lots, nice drive. 

Cons: walking trails. I would have thought there'd be tons of trails out in the country but I was wrong. Not a decent trail to be found (unless you drive to the Rec complex and walk through the forest. I'm used to paved walking trails and Wilmot does not have any!  They totally need one that goes from New Hamburg to Baden via the Wilmot Rec complex that has solar lights so I can go on late night strolls, like I did in Kitchener.  

Night life. There is stuff here, but things close early, and it's dark. I'm used to walking late at night and it's just dark here. However, I have had people over to my house more since my yard and deck are much bigger. We order in and it's great! I have a lovely view in my back yard so I'm enjoying hosting more. 

PRO - proximity to highway makes everything accessible. It sometimes feels like a longer drive than it is, but it's really only 7 minutes to the outskirts of Kitchener and it's straight highway, no traffic, beautiful scenery. 

PRO: Less busy. Grocery shopping and gas are much easier here. School pick ups are easier.

"> The vaccine does not stop transmission.

But it reduces transmission significantly by reducing viral load in the individual which then reduces the amount of viral particles in the droplets they breathe out.

Plus nobody ever said that this vaccine 100% stops everything.

Nobody has ever said that about any vaccine, ever.

Vaccines are there only to reduce risk of outcomes (transmission, hospitalisation, death) to manageable levels.

"Apparently the tick thing is a myth developed by a flawed study where they caged different animals and dropped hundreds of ticks on them and counted how many fell off after 4 days. Since very few fell off oppossums and squirrels, it was assumed that the ticks were eaten by those animals. Not a very convincing study to make claims that oppossums eat thousands of ticks a week as is often repeated. 

In a new study, the stomach contents and scat of oppossums were dissected and they found no evidence of ticks. Here's an article summarizing this whole debacle.

"Used to enjoy going to the live house shows there during the 80s boom with Grandpa, (I mention live because they used to do Wrestlemania on closed circuit). I recall when Macho Man Savage had the world title and put Liz on his shoulder after the match.

Was even there in March/April 1999 during that peak (edit, in popularity of wrestling, WCW was already in downward spiral) when WCW Saturday Night did a taping, Chris Jericho was a heel and buried a Hawaiian guy and people marked out to Raven and Perry Saturn's theme music.

"Union doesn't make these calls.

This is a direct result of taking away buses and creating bigger ""walk zones"" and doubling and in some cases tripling bus routes. 

My kids, for instance, should have went to a school less than 120m from their house. That school was folded into a bigger school (the real cost of gentrification in my city), and then the boundary of THAT school was changed, so now my children walk 2km to their school as they aren't considered in the bus zone. I work for the board, so they come in with me. They walk the 3rd furthest distance of all 300 kids at their school. We live in the downtown core.

When all of these boundaries were changed, the responsibility of the safety of the students walking remained the jurisdiction of the individual boards.

Add inclusion of all children (for instance wcdsb does not have DD class placement), and you have a situation where you can't pick and choose who the weather is safe for and who it isn't.

The custodians do salt with the limited amount they are given. We also have schools that are in desperate need of paving, new eaves, new, well, everything.

"This has all been good information.  Please post an update,  if you have one OP. 

I have a dog with severe allergies and I do my best to be a responsible owner. He is always on leash because I don't want him eating something he shouldn't.

We also have a neighborhood rat infestation that we have been fighting for over a decade. Leaving food around cannot be helpful.  

It also is unsightly.  They food is put in multiple disposable plastic containers that you would buy meat in. It literally looks like garbage.

He's actually an incredibly sweet boy. No one believes that he has aggression but we ensure he's never put in any position to fail.

"It changed in part due to covid and increased comfort with online school but it can also be looked at with an equity lens to keep education consistent across the board. On bus days, schools with mostly walking populations would learn, while at bus schools so few kids would show up that those who were there wouldn't be learning anything. Now everybody will have access to learning tools. I don't know if that's necessarily good - buses have arguably driven through some extra horrendous conditions this year to avoid calling it, and we usually don't miss enough days to have to make them up anyway so having these days count as learning days doesn't really matter. For those complaining about teachers, in the past teachers had to go to school on snow days in case anyone showed up, and if 4 kids from your class showed up on a bus day you wouldn't be having a regular lesson regardless. Either way the teachers are working a lighter day but also either way they're still working and this doesn't change any of that.

"How come every other institution and business can figure it out? There's over 2 million kids in elementary schools across Ontario. If you're going to hold isolated cases up as if they are the norm, then you might as well shut schools down permanently.  People fall down stairs, get hit by cars, fall off bikes, trip over curbs etc everyday. Why arent hospitals closed today? Why didn't the OPP close down the 401?

Every school has custodial staff that could take 10 mins to salt the sidewalks. This is just unions creating obstacles that prevent common sense from taking over and finding a way to make it work. But what's the incentive, everyone in the school system is getting paid today for not doing their job, unlike thousands of people who have to stay home with their kids and bail on work.

Locally, the economic impact of closing schools is literally millions of dollars of lost wages each day and that trickles down through the entire local economy.

You can get her a membership for about $50/month, which includes lots of swimming options (for both of you - you swim free), weekly swim lessons, indoor gym sessions, and free PlayCare (where you drop her off and enjoy some personal time, you have to stay in the building).

"I dont mind a good bar, but its definitely not my thing. Heres the crap part though... most stuff in kw closes by 10pm (yes even on weekends) unless its serving alcohol. So, bearing that in mind here are my favourite activities for evenings in kw with general price ranges:

1. Climb mount trashmore and look at the city lights. Remember that you are not in toronto. Bitch about it. Go home.

2. Pinup arcade bar (stay away on weekends) is full of old video games, pin ball machines, dance dance revolution... 5$ flat fee entry plus whatever you spend on drinks (no food options available inside tge arcade but you can pop out and grab something after since its in the uni area and surrounded by cheap digs. 

3. Play pool at break room or heuther hotel. Both serve alcohol but you don't gotta buy it and tgey lack tge telltale signs of being a real bar. Avoid heuther on weekends, uni kids swarm the place. Tables are usually 6-12$ per hour and come with everything you need.

4. Apollo cinema and princess cinema often have fun little shows going on. Yes they show movies but they also have events. Sometimes really great, sometimes memorable because they were scary bad but always a good time. Last week I saw the Cats movie from 2019 there  with burlesque dancers, z comedian, and terrible audience participation. Idk how to feel but I definitely wasn't bored. 

5. Bowling (pretty expensive without a group) but I like to go with 4 ppl to Victoria bowls and its like 8-15 $ per person for an hour ish of time. 

6. Rusty nails comedy at tge crazy canuk often has semi decent comedy shows happening for reasonable prices. Usually 10 to 25$ per person plus whatever food you want. Jane bond has tge same thing occasionally 

7. I don't remember the place but I used to do Square dancing lessons on Thursday nights and then same thing but ballroom dancing. I think its named after a celebrity and I remember it came out to like 15$ per 1.5 hour lesson. That was a while ago now bit I think they still do it. 

8. There are board game cafes all around town that offer things like community game nights and drop in dnd sessions. These places also often throw theme nights and there are special foods, ppl in costume, special games... they can be fun if thats your thing. Admission costs are different here but usually you just need to buy something worth 5-10$ on the menu so just order food or something

9. In the winter there is Chicopee for skiing/ snowboarding / tubing and lots of places to go skating. Most are open until 10pm  

10. This isn't z night time thing but clay and glass gallery has some super fun programs for all ages. I did their clay time thing a few weeks ago and go to make some fun stuff for about 20$. You get 2 hours at that price and its super fun. 

11. Drive to Elora quarry and go for a summer swim. Watch out though, a lot of high school students take the plunge nude for who knows what reason. 

12. Mustang drive in theater in Guelph is great too

"Slightly unrelated but why does it seem like 90% of volunteer opportunities are only available during the day?

That said, Rogers sucks but adding another layer to the problem such as going through a 3rd party, just means yet another link in the communication/troubleshooting chain when something goes wrong.  In situations like that, Rogers likes to play games like skip appointments in what I believe is an attempt to make your experience with the 3rd party terrible.  For example, when I was with Teksavvy, I moved twice which required a visit of Rogers.  Both times, Rogers no showed and said I didn't answer my door.

"I've heard nothing but good reviews of TekSavvy and they're one of the few ISPs that actually advocate for consumers (when they get a discount, they drop their customers rates too). The only downside is that it appears the fastest speed they offer (that I can find on their site) is 100 Mbps.

Edit: You can apparently get faster speeds, 100 Mbps was just the fastest I found on their website on their ""Internet"" information page.

Alternatively, if you'd like to choose the lesser of two evils, Bell has been giving me decent rates the last two years. They seem to always have a promo available, even if it's not a big promo. My first year with them I got 500 Mbps for like $60 after promo.

"All of your points are valid; I just want to add every time I have lived in a noisy neighborhood Ear Plugs were a life saver.  They are a cheap and easy fix to help you get a better sleep.  If you are worried about sleeping in and missing your alarm clock (which I was) I reccomend a smart watch of some kind (fitbit, apple, garkin, etc.) because they often have a vibrating function for alarms that will wake you up if worn while you are sleeping (they also have the added benefit of helping you track your sleep cycle/REM patterns which is interesting to see in a data format over time).  If you are concerned about fire alarms or CO2 detectors going off in your sleep you (or atleast I) can still hear them through ear plugs.  Ear plugs were great for drowning out street/outside noise.

I often travel for work and whenever I stay at a hotel I either bring them with me or ask the front desk for ear plugs for the same reason - it helps drown out hallway noise/people closing doors/hotel staff cleaning and vacuuming (especially helpful if you are working night shift and are trying to sleep during the day when people are constantly moving around)",t2_jnpdijsu,WelcometoKW,1,1647883526.0,0,t1_i1jyijh,i1jyijh,False,reddit-and-forgeddit,t3_tjb7n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchener/comments/tjb7n8/have_a_friend_moving_to_kitchener_and_looking_for/,Have a friend moving to Kitchener and looking for a place.
