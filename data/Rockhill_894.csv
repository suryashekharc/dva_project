"Density is Not necessarily required for non-car commutes. Just the safety and infrastructure is. I would gladly ride a bike to work if it was safe enough to do so.

"Let's be real, we need to think ahead now, and get political action for this kind of stuff moving now. Not later. Otherwise we'll end up like Charlotte.

Rock Hill needs a properly planned and mapped out bus system, and designated bike lanes.

Hell I'd even argue what we really need is a ""Metrolina Lightrail"" running from Belmont through Lake Wylie to Rock Hill on top of the eventual Pineville line running through Fort Mill to Rock Hill (Charlotte, being as sprawling as it is, just needs a ""wheel and spokes"" system in general).

I say all this as someone who commutes from Lake Wylie, but wants to see Rock Hill be a city where you can commute from your apartment to Winthrop/Work/etc. by bicycle or bus safely, or even just walk.

The problem is, there's going to be massive opposition to anything like this outside of Rock Hill itself.

"I would avoid Piedmont at all costs. My fiancee had to be admitted and was kept for 8 days cause the doctor took a long weekend and came back a day later than he was supposed to. 

They misdiagnosed her the first time and missed a serious infection so we were back in less than two weeks, for another 8 days. During this trip, when she had to go to the bathroom she asked the nurse to help her up and unhook from the iv. She was told to just go in the bed and is their join to clean it up. 

She was not the one that ended cleaning it up and when the nurse that had to clean heard what was says she immediately went to the head nurse because it was ""unacceptable behavior"".

All in all, she had to be admitted to the hospital three times total and then go every day for a month for any antibiotic infusion. Most of it could have been avoided if they didn't beat around the bush the first time and give her timely service.

"I moved here from Charlotte about 18 months ago and there's been problem after problem that make me regret moving here. For the first year I thought that the smell was my septic tank and even had a few people come out and look at it to see what was wrong.

I'm looking for a new place to move soon and hope to be out of here within 6 months.  I've experienced issues with violent crime with no help from police, shady developers destroying my property and Rock Hill City pressuring me to give part of my property to the developer for free and also allowing them to annex my property so I would have to pay Rock Hill City tax with no benefit to me or my property but they would almost double my taxes.  The violent crime has left me in a constant state of distress and it seems like things tend to happen when I start to relax. I caught some sketchy person trespassing on my property yesterday and they took off running when I tried to ask them what they were doing and they got into an old truck full of people that was parked a few properties down, I'm thinking they were probably trying to figure out if anyone was home and had planned to rob my house.  The scariest thing so far is one night I was in my driveway at around 1am and one of my neighbors came out yelling and then fired 6 shots in my direction, the police didn't even go to the person's house.

"Ahh maybe they’re just referring to it all as the Randolph Yarns site.  It looks like on Zillow it got bought in Late Jan this yr.  Its also apparently Site B for the new Panthers complex, but maybe it’s not actually going to be developed now that Site A is a full go.  There were articles claiming that Ralph Norman owned all the property through multiple holdings and was trying to get this Site B approved instead of Site A.  The whole thing is pretty weird.

"It’s always sad when rich and interesting history of a place is diminished into absurd spooky stories. 
I’ve come across several people online with grandparents like yours who worked in the mill and yarn factory. Seems that it was important to Carhartt to be progressive during his time and the mill provided jobs to lots of women, and Randolph Yarns continued that tradition. Unfortunate about the child labor,  even though it was typical for their time. 

I wish the history of this little space was more readily available. Considering it’s all going to be razed soon enough and turned into an industrial park :( 

Exploring the area felt like a little step back into history, except for the modern-yet-desecrated trailer.

"So, Randolph Yarns is what took over the mill way back when- and it became a yarn factory. They still own the land where the mill was, but according to property tax records all of the land on that street is still owned by David R Lafar III Family LLC. He bought it all up in , I can’t remember, the 90s or 2001. He is deceased but his family manages all the properties in the LLC name- his daughter maybe? 

Randolph Yarns did buy the plot I mentioned, that was previously owned by Karen Burson - the site with the trailer on it. 

I have NO CLUE why Randolph yarns bought this plot. The company in the document you linked, which I read last night - list the applicant for this project (an Industrial complex) as SCP Acquisitions. Randolph Yarns is listed as one of the owners, along with the Lafar family and Ms Burson (who sold her land to Randolph yarns just after this meeting) .... but the plans seem to be labeled “Randolph yarns industrial park” so I wonder if SCP is a company they’ve hired to assist with all this. 

Totally weird tbh because Randolph Yarns was a local manufacturing company that went defunct between 96 and 2000, when the factory was demolished- so they’ve owned that land without using it for 20 years (but they’ve owned it since the 30s , I think they bought it either shortly before or after Hamilton Carhartt’s death). I wonder who, for more than twenty years,  has sat on the remains of this dead company until they found a use for the land.",t2_y9c9n,sirmaamalot,0,1599578317.0,0,t1_g4g53sj,g4g53sj,False,sirmaamalot,t3_iolw2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockhill/comments/iolw2c/lynderboro_st_demons_trail/,Lynderboro St / “Demon’s Trail”,/r/Rockhill/comments/iolw2c/lynderboro_st_demons_trail/g4g53sj/,2,r/Rockhill,0,2
"My grandmother grew up there before the Depression. She used to drive me through there in the 70s. Everything was mostly gone (remnants of houses). She described it as having lovely rose bushes as you turned onto thre street. Her father worked at the mill.  She did too as soon as she was able to see over the top of the loom (age eight). She described a circle of houses (several round but not all). Two of the houses had a well in the yard. All of the families could access the wells at those homes. She said families would often exchange homes (don't know why). She said the structure in thre back was the school for the employee's children.  I think (not sure) that the church beside the mill was their church.

"I’ve got some info that was passed down from my parents who grew up in Rock Hill during 60s and 70s when the mill was still there. I think you really nailed most of the spooky origins of the place. The houses were round, with round windows, circular roofs etc, which seems pretty odd for the time and surroundings. Apparently it was a fairly insular community which I imagine made outsiders feel a bit weird and out of place when visiting. Maybe adds to uneasy feeling that sparked all the stories in the first place. I got taken down there in the 90s and you could still see some of the round houses intact and inhabited and the mill was still there. I think without the mill looming over the woods it’s less spooky now but nonetheless it still felt a little creepy when I was there a couple of years ago. 

As for the church, the story goes that they were building this church for the mill workers on this road. I don’t think it was in the center of the cul-de-sac but behind it. You can probably find the remnants of the structure in the woods. Anyways, they were making this church and the time came to hoist this big ass cross on top. I guess it was a pretty big cross made of iron or something and took a lot of effort to get up there. The next day when the construction crew came back the cross had mysteriously turned upside down in its place. This halted the construction of the church and it never got finished and spawned a ton of stories about the place locally. It also turned it into a shitty car tour performed by high school kids looking to scare their dates. 

Honestly the stories are probably all BS and the people were probably just victims of othering. I imagine if I lived there I would hate having bratty kids drive through gawking at my community while I’m just trying to earn a meager living and make the most of the cards I was dealt. So that’s my story about the place. I’m looking forward to see if there are any other stories out there.

"I’m not sure I agree about the over priced statements on here. Once the Panthers practice facility opens, I think the value will go up and nice equity is probable. Also, the new Legal Remedy Brewery just opened rounding out a nice little bar crawl in the neighborhood. The walking trial is one of the nicest around and there is plans for many more cool developments to come.  It is also my understanding that one of the conditions of the Panthers moving down to RH was that the RH airport had to lengthen the runway allowing large airliners to land and take off. This will likely open the door for service from discount airlines such as Allegiant and Spirit to begin at the RH airport.  That could be huge.  The area is booming for a reason.

"I just moved back to Rock Hill after being away for about five years.

When I went kayaking recently, I couldn't even park at the dam it was so crowded. It was almost all people in tubes. And there was so much trash everywhere. My kids even commented on the trash floating down the river.

I'm glad the river has become more popular, but please show some respect to the environment and the other people there. Don't leave trash lying around and, especially now, don't crowd around close to people and take forever on the ramp so that you create a huge line getting in and out of the water.

">[Blacks] make up a majority of violent police interactions. (...) [A] white man with no weapon is twice as likely to be shot than a black man with a legally classified ""deadly weapon.""

>There is no unjustified brutalization of specifically blacks. In fact, most studies have proven police handle blacks with kid gloves, often hesitating to use force 2 seconds longer than with a white person. They're also more likely to misidentify a white person as a threat 14 times more often than a black man. Black officers are three times as likely to shoot a white man than white officers are to shoot a black man.

Where are your sources? Without them, these are baseless claims. You say “most studies”, so surely you must have several come to mind.

>Your whole comment is regurgitating propaganda

It’s funny you should say that.

>Just because you have ONE statistic doesn't mean you have the whole picture. I'm tired of hearing about how racist this country is to a group that commits over 80% of interracial violence.

I have several statistics, actually. Again, where are your sources?

Anyway, by “icon”, I meant “a person or thing regarded as a representative symbol.” I did not intend for you to interpret it as a synonym of saint. I suppose a better choice of words would be to say that Floyd is the face of the movement, along with all of the other black people unjustly killed by the police. His death was a catalyst for the protests.

Additionally, I know you never said that meth was the cause of his death, but you did imply that him being high at that moment was reason enough for the police to murder him. I added that source to reiterate that it was mostly irrelevant to what happened.

>There is no such thing as systematic racism and your source does nothing to prove it.

Yes, there is no such thing as “systematic racism”, because the actual term for it is “systemic racism.”

> It's literally just propaganda made by a company that has, for at least a decade now, tried to push their branding into the political space.

Politics encompasses all parts of society, big and small. I respect that they are using their platform to educate others.

>Your need actual facts to make claims like this.

I am simply stating the facts as they are presented. If you click on any of the hyperlinks in the Ben and Jerry’s article, they will lead to sources that have facts to support their claims.

>You should read your source. It says explicitly that yes, he is a convicted woman beater but the photo being passed around is not the same woman.

It does not explicitly say that. It does not even imply it. Indeed, it states the exact opposite:
“Floyd served five years in prison for the armed robbery, but there is no evidence that Henriquez was pregnant at the time, and ***her injuries were inflicted by another man.***” Floyd participated in the robbery, but he did not inflict any physical injuries upon that woman.

"While your website shows more blacks are killed by police, what it leaves out is they make up a majority of violent police interactions. When you remove criminals from the total population and look solely at what percentage of police interactions go sideways, you see that a white man with no weapon is twice as likely to be shot than a black man with a legally classified ""deadly weapon."" You are looking at a single statistic without context which is known more commonly as ""propaganda.""

There is no such thing as systematic racism and your source does nothing to prove it. It's literally just propaganda made by a company that has, for at least a decade now, tried to push their branding into the political space. Your need actual facts to make claims like this.

"With respect, I disagree. While data is hard to come by, what we have shows that black people are the most likely to be killed by police. I recommend that you check out [this website](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org) and the way they collect their [data.](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/aboutthedata)

I do agree that white people experience racism and I condemn those who say that we don’t. However, it is important to clarify that it is to a MUCH lesser extent than what POC experience; systemic racism is on a much larger scale than individual accounts of prejudice. See [here.](https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2016/systemic-racism-is-real) 

Additionally, I want to state that George Floyd was not a woman-beater. [Source](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/16/instagram-posts/no-photo-doesnt-show-woman-george-floyd-allegedly-/) 

While he was shown to have meth in his system, it was proven to be not the cause of his death. [Source](https://knsiradio.com/news/local-news/expert-drug-toxicity-had-no-bearing-george-floyds-cause-death) 

Furthermore, “[Hennepin County] attributed the cause of death to ‘cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.’
In other words, Mr. Floyd’s heart stopped beating and his lungs stopped taking in air while he was being restrained by law enforcement.”

I do not agree with your statement that people are representing George Floyd as a “saint”; he is simply an icon for the BLM movement, as his death brought forth a resurgence of the public’s anger towards the police and their unjustified brutalization and targeting of black people.

"My wife and I moved to Rock Hill in 2014 and we love it. Our son was born just after we moved and it’s a great place to raise a family. There’s so much to do in the area with kids and we go to Charlotte very rarely. We live out near McConnells and got a couple acres so it’s great for us. But there’s all kinds of neighborhoods in Rock Hill that fit whatever kind of lifestyle you’re looking for, whether it’s close knit neighbors, larger properties, big rural lands, apartments, etc. Lots of choice. And it’s still pretty cheap considering the area. 

Now, as far as the commute goes, that depends, both on where you live, where your kids go to school, and so on. I work near Carowinds, so I drive into Charlotte pretty much as little as possible, and yet my drive from as far southwest as I am is about an hour. If I had to drive another 30-45 minutes into Uptown, I would hate it. But if I lived closer to the highway, it wouldn’t be as long a commute. If you have a job that you really love and pays well uptown, then that may make it worth it. If your kid goes to school elsewhere that may make it worth it (my kid goes to school in Gastonia so I would be driving a bit anyway). 

I lived in five different parts of Charlotte over the course of six years, and I wouldn’t want to live in any of those areas again. The whole city has become incredibly crowded and just so hard to drive through at most times of the day. And I grew up in Toronto. The only place my wife and I would consider moving to now if we left Rock Hill is somewhere in Gaston County, which is becoming pretty busy itself.

I am currently researching Dolphin proof vests and head gear.  They can read our thoughts and we can't risk this. It's extremely difficult to uppercut a dolphin if they know what you are going to do before you even do it. We need meeting spots and a crew.

"This was posted by RH around 10 PM 

Crews were able to expose the broken pipe, and will secure the surrounding dirt to begin making repairs. The pipe, originally thought to be 24”, is actually a 20” cast iron pipe. It is one of several that feed water from the water plant into the distribution system. 
Due to the volume of water, the plant had to be shut down to stop the flow and allow crews to expose the broken portion. They will begin to cut away the ruptured section to replace it with a new piece. We hope to have the plant up and running around midnight, but we expect it to take about 12 hours to re-pressurize the system. Starting tomorrow morning, field crews will flush hydrants to move water through the system, reducing air in the lines and clearing sediment. 
We’ll pull samples from across the water service area to monitor water quality. The boil water advisory will be lifted once chlorine levels are stable. City crews have been working diligently since this afternoon to make repairs as safely and efficiently as possible. We thank our customers county-wide for your patience as we work to return to normal operations.
