"Yes, the individual sites are past the group sites on the left as you drive into the valley. Stay left (east side of the valley) to reach the numbered individual sites, and stay left again when the road splits. There are several sites at the base of the hill as you continue south on this dead end road. If you go right at the split, you end up on the road to the pictographs, which is a nice shortish hike.  If you have time you should drive around both sides of the valley floor as there are other sites for camping. The roads are well marked and you can't get lost.

And the rock garden well, like everyone here says, it was cleared and graded about 2 years ago. I don't have a clue why but it's no longer the challenge it once was.

"Had a fun time taking my 23’ R-Pod to Holmes Camp in Ocotillo Wells last February:

1. Internet/cell signal drops off the further you head off the main road/beaten path

2. Campers are generally friendly and helpful; expect the smells of campfire cookouts, barbecues, and a general 90s morale (pre-Internet, pre-social media, etc.)

3. If you need Internet in a pinch, there’s the “cell-phone lot” back a ways up the road, or at the top of the hill between Camp Holmes and the road.

4. The nearby commissary/equipment rental place is overpriced (forgot the bacon, I know..) but the guy who runs it is a family man which is nice

5. **Don’t forget the backup (insert commodity here)!** It’s the desert and stuff breaks - I helped my neighbors MacGyver a few work-arounds last time which was neat

6. Informally, check-in (for most people) starts Friday afternoon and by noon/midmorning Sunday, most folks hit the road

7. Public bathrooms are surprisingly clean and well-serviced (our tax dollars at work) though a decent walk from part of the main campsite (becomes more of an issue at night)

8. You’ll have your speed demons on tricked-out and lit-up quads, bikes, trucks throughout the night, so try to wear hi-vis clothes, bring ear plugs, and either a sleep blindfold or your curtains",t2_90nquqg3,TheBuddingCactus,0,1643611207.0,0,t1_huypsfy,huypsfy,True,Wave-Extreme,t3_sgisxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnzaBorrego/comments/sgisxw/anza_borregoococtillo_wells_camping_advice/,Anza Borrego/Ococtillo Wells camping advice?,/r/AnzaBorrego/comments/sgisxw/anza_borregoococtillo_wells_camping_advice/huypsfy/,2,r/AnzaBorrego,0,2

"I'm unaware of the restrictions of OHV in the park.  I know you can ride all over Ocotillo wells (I mean, I know you're renting there but in case you didn't already know that).  


Very near there is a campground at the opening of split mountain/fish creek and it's one of my favorite places in AB. Look south from Ocotillo wells and you may be at to see the giant mine. Right there.. So much back there you'll be amazed.  Elephant knees, wind caves, overall tons of very very cool geological formations. It's like a slot canyon you can drive through. Keep going and there is the mud caves. 


Again, I don't know the exact restrictions since I was always in a jeep or truck, but some of the terrain out there would be very beneficial to have a dirt bike or quad.

Do they rent street legal dirt bikes?  That would be ideal.

">I didn't throw Fonts point, fish creek, or the main area of Blair valley since they're the most popular places in the park. Technically here is a way to go from Fish creek to Arroyo seco, but it's a one way drop off into Fish creek from Arroyo seco.

While these areas are very popular with ""tourists"" it would be a shame for you to miss out on the views and scenery in these areas if you've never seen them. During the winter months there's always people around even in some of these remote areas. However it's definitely less busy on weekdays. 

Regarding Fish Creek, to Arroyo Seco to Canyon Sin Nombre...you can run it north to south. Yes yes I know that Diablo Dropoff is technically ""one-way"" but as a Ranger once mentioned to me, if vehicles are safely using spotters to control uphill/downhill traffic, it's rarely an issue. It also depends on the condition of the dropoff. Sometimes it's really rutted and beat up, other times it's nice and graded that you can make it up in a Honda Civic. In any case, excellent scenery and camping spots on that route.

"I'd recommend checking out Coyote canyon from Borrego springs. Head up to indian/cougar canyon and hike around for half a day. Check out the Salvador canyon area and middle willows from there. Not a lot of people go out that way. That's a day in itself. Plenty of spaces to camp

From there, check out thimble trail, east on short wash, south on fault wash which takes you to the Ocotillo Wells boundary. I'd head west on Cut across trail til it hits San Felipe wasn and check out hills of the moon and rainbow wash. Not sure on the condition of San Felipe beyond that as it gets into Borrego Sink and it can be pretty muddy and soft, so I'd go out towards Texas dip. From here I'd head south to and west on highway 78 and camp at Pinyon, Nolina or Mine wash. Or check out any of the washes off hwy 78

Day 3, head out on the 78 west and go south on S2 towards agua caliente. I'd drive through little Blair, hike around a bit, go out to Mason Valley and head north towards Oriflame and Rodriguez canyon just to drive around. Then head south on S2 and hit up June wash for the evening and camp out there. 


Day 4, head South and across the highway from the community of Canebrake, is Vallecito creek, which gives you access to the Carrizo badlands. Check out all the washes there. I like View of the Badlands and the north ends of Arroyo tapiado and Arroyo seco del diablo. The mud caves are at Arroyo tapiado. You can then head south towards Carrizo marsh and there's a series of washes that lead west with plenty of areas to camp. You can even check out Carrizo gorge on the west side of S2 and camp here or head up Canyon sin nombre (closer to the Marsh) and camp in a wash further south. 

Day 5, you're pretty much at the south end of the park along S2. There's Mortero wash, and dos cabezas to check out. At this point you can settle here or continue south to BLM land down to the town of Ocotillo Wells, hop on the 8 west to Jacumba. Here you can find BLM land and some Parks land surrounding the town where you can end your trip. You could see the border from here. 

I didn't throw Fonts point, fish creek, or the main area of Blair valley since they're the most popular places  in the park. Technically here is a way to go from Fish creek to Arroyo seco, but  it's a one way drop off into Fish creek from Arroyo seco. 

I've lived and worked here for a while. Remember to have plenty of water and food, know rules about where to camp and where to drive your vehicle. If you see ground fires/rock fire pits, don't use them. Use a proper metal container for fires. Pack in your trash and pack it out. Certain campgrounds have dumpsters and bathrooms, such as Tamarisk Grove which is right off hwy 78 and yaqui pass Rd. 

Cell service can be extremely limited. At&t and Verizon work best, and let people know where your destinations are.

You can get a fire license online. Never been asked for it, though.

Rule is: everything you bring must leave with you, including the burnt fire wood.

In the desert things don’t biodegrade like they do elsewhere.

They take aerial and satellite photos to search for signs of ancient campfires used by the native peoples. When we leave campfires it makes it hard to find them.

"Of course you can enjoy your trip in two wheel drive. The park has a wide variety of terrains, elevations, and vegetation. It is too big to see it all in one day, even if you stay on paved roads. 

Visit the park visitor's center or Agua Caliente county park, drive county road S-2 from Ocotillo to Ranchita, or route 78 from Julian to the Salton Sea or drive from Santa Ysabel to Borrego Springs and then on to the Salton Sea in a completely different terrain. Just don't try to do all of these in one day.

If you do want to get off paved roads then just be sure to stay within walking distance of a paved road and carry plenty of water. 

I suspect that your Mercedes would do well in sand, better than the Mazda that I drove on my first visit.

About a mile drive over a wash and on the left, you'll find an extra amount of bush's (maybe). On the left look for a cement slab. That is where the spring used to be. There were a couple of other seeps in the area. One at the tree line. At the end and down a slope there was a small trickle of water. At the time there was a pipe punched into the ground.

"I'm assuming by your question that you aren't super familiar with the ABDSP.  Apologies if that's not right.

1) Its hot out there right now.  Even though the weather says its only high 80s/low 90s, the ground has been heating up out there and the sun can be brutal.

2) Traffic in the park, especially off the asphalt is really low right now.  If you get stuck in the sand, you won't see anyone drive by for days or weeks if you go really secluded.

3) Washes are sandy, after a long hot summer that sand is super soft.  Unless you know what you are doing, you will get stuck, and without others to help you will be in trouble quickly.

4) Cell service is very spotty in the park.  Its generally ok on the highway, but on the dirt you can't count on it.

That being said, I suggest rock house canyon.  You won't have to go far up the canyon to be away from people.  If stuff goes bad, then its a hike back out to the road and you will have cell service, and you are only a few miles from Borrego Springs, so worst case, 10 mile hike .

Bring at least 2  gallons of water per person per day, and if you leave sight of your car, bring your phone and at least 1/2 gallon of water.

"It really depends on your comfort level. I've driven a FWD audi a3 hatchback to the mud caves, but I've been going out there in my Tacoma and other more capable vehicles for the better part of 15 years. With that said I absolutely do not recommend driving to the mud caves your first time. You can head that direction just to see how far you can go with the plan of turning around, but rains will constantly change the road and portions might be impassable with low clearance 2wd.

The first time my buddy and I went out there we drove as far as we were comfortable then pitched a tent on the side of vallecito. Your confidence will grow each time you go out there. Vallecito Creek Road is pretty navigable, the first 100-200 yards after you turn off of S2 are in the poorest shape which scares most people away, but it smooths out after that. Just pick good lines, avoid the soft sand, and if you're really worried have your friend step out of the car and walk in front of you about 20 yards as you find the best route. He can chuck the bigger rocks out of your way if there are any and help you avoid any soft areas.

In October you'll start seeing more vehicles out there so in the event that you do get stuck you'll likely see some folks to help you if needed (bring a tow strap and know where to attach it).

Another nice thing about camping around Vallecito Creek Rd. is that you're decently close to Agua Caliente County Park. If you feel the need to clean up you can pay the day-use fee and use their showers (bring quarters) and pool. You can also elect to camp there as a back-up plan.

When the sun rises or sets make sure you're on top of one of the hills doing absolutely nothing but sipping a beer/coffee and enjoying the show.

Downloading a GPS app on your phone would also be helpful. I've used Gaia GPS which allows you to download maps for times you are without cell service. Full moons are great for night time walk-abouts, but the star filled nights are my favorite. It can get pretty cold out there at night starting in October, bring some warmer clothes just in case.",t2_21nzqut4,Spoonlala,0,1629822757.0,0,t1_ha6gf3s,ha6gf3s,True,Metzhara,t3_p9wdw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnzaBorrego/comments/p9wdw4/basic_upcoming_break_needed_any_suggestions/,"Basic Upcoming Break Needed, any suggestions?",/r/AnzaBorrego/comments/p9wdw4/basic_upcoming_break_needed_any_suggestions/ha6gf3s/,3,r/AnzaBorrego,0,3

"Not at the edge, there's a barrier that states no vehicles past that point,. The end of that wash is pretty uneven if you have a roof top tent. If you'll be setting up a tent, you can park and walk out to your camping spot. 

The series of washes leading up to and in that area can get very sandy over the summer. I live in Borrego Springs, and know the park really well. I  have pulled people out of the sand in various washes near there and fonts every summer for the last few years. Like stated above, I'd wait another month or two before venturing out. 

If you decide to come out, bring more water than you think you need. A few gallons per person, per day. There is not really any cell service in the washes leading up to these view points, until you get to a high spot or the viewpoint itself. And that's if you have Verizon or ATT.

I’ve only been once and it was over a year ago so take everything with a grain of salt but as I recall the wash is very flat but it is very sandy. I think you should be fine with AWD as long as you somewhat know what you’re doing. When I was there there was a regular stream of traffic passing through so I’m sure you could pretty easily get help if you do get stuck. Of course it’s impossible to know if there will be a spot available but it is fairly late in the season so I’d wager your chances are good.

"It's going to be fairly hot, so please bring way more water than you could actually use.

Look for the 'Canebrake' community sign along S2 shortly before the mud cave turnoff. I was out there not that long ago and found that the main wash heading toward Arroyo Tapiado is wide and has multiple roads. This can make it easy to miss the turn as the sign is pretty small. Do your best to follow along with the map and be in the left side of the Arroyo when the turn is coming up. 

One you make the turn into Arroyo Tapiado, it's another mile or so until the canyon narrows. At that point, just explore slot canyons and caves that look interesting. Each person should carry multiple light sources. You will also get very dusty, so keep that in mind when deciding what electronics to bring with you hiking.

Have fun!

PS - ""The Slot"" is another very fun area to explore, and access is much easier as it's a short distance from the paved road:  https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/the-slot-anza-borrego-desert/#:~:text=Simply%20named%20The%20Slot%2C%20this,will%20be%20much%20more%20profound.",t2_8pg40qc6,SanMiguelDayAllende,0,1617419641.0,0,t1_gt7kzzf,gt7kzzf,True,PasadenaNative,t3_mixt62,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnzaBorrego/comments/mixt62/tamarisk_grove_to_the_mud_caves/,Tamarisk Grove to the mud caves,/r/AnzaBorrego/comments/mixt62/tamarisk_grove_to_the_mud_caves/gt7kzzf/,2,r/AnzaBorrego,0,2
"Done this a million times in my wrangler... the 4 by 4 helps in some of the soft sand areas, that's where you might run into a bit of trouble. I've seen regular SUV's out there that didn't seem to have a problem.  Just remember to keep moving, momentum is your friend, don't stop on the soft sand. Also, the mudcaves are always changing and shifting a bit with the rains each year. There's been times where a spot I loved exploring was no longer accessible. My favorite one out of all of them is Carey's Cave, takes you through some beautiful areas, canyons, and ends up on a very dry, desolate stretch of Mars like soil.

"Not sure how used to Anza you are or where you're coming in from. The temperature is still going to drop a LOT at night now. What temps are your tent(s) rated for? Sleeping bag and mat? Do you have warm layers? if you're car camping (vs backpacking into a spot) you have a lot of flexibility to bring extra stuff. That's probably a good idea (to bring extra) until you are more used to camping and have gear dialed in. My typical winter camping set up looks like - 3 season tent, sleeping bag rated for 15 degrees (keep in mind most sleeping bags are rated for \*survival\* temps, NOT comfort. I do sleep cold though so 15 may be overkill for some), an inflatable sleeping mat, and then I wear wool leggings, a wool long sleeve shirt, a fleece, and sometimes a puffy jacket. ymmv. I'd say overprepare for this trip and you can always take layers off or leave them in the car. 

If you've never camped before - practice setting up your tent and other equipment before you go. They are usually straight forward it's good to be familiar before you're out there, and to make sure nothing is damaged or missing. 

Are you using a camping stove or bringing food you don't have to cook? Test the stove too if you're bringing one. 

Leave an itinerary of where you're going with someone who isn't coming on the trip. 

If you're off-roading, do you have multiple vehicles or are you sharing one car? If you're sharing one car - consider bringing an SOS beacon or sat phone (eg a Garmin InReach Mini)- there's no cell service in Anza and if you get stuck in a remote area that's not great. Blown out tires, damaged rigs, etc - things happen.

"Totally fine to visit during summer but:

* Don't push your limits in your 2WD car.  I would stick to trails that are totally fine for 2WD.  This is mainly because during summer, many trails will have NO other cars/drivers.  So it will be on you and you alone to get unstuck (especially if you don't have cell service -- which can be spotty in the park).  Which can be dangerous in extreme heat.
* Bring lots of water in case you do get stuck or have a breakdown.  I usually take a 5 gallon jug for emergency, and then the normal gallon per person in more usable (smaller) formats.
* It's still fun just to cruise the various desert roads, check out christmas circle and the sculptures.  Get out and stop whenever u see something interesting.

Fun fact: if you've got 4x4 and explore the dirt roads just north (maybe, 1/2 to 3/4 mile) of the checkpoint, we found some really strange voodoo like shit out there.  It weirded me the F out.

OK, here u go: https://imgur.com/dVqOYpf

Still have no idea what it was.  Our best guess (and this is a reaching) was that it was some kind of curse on the station.  My wife's quote ""That is some santaria shit right there"".   The pinkish ""bubble gum"" bottom part was really off-the-wall man.  Pic might not do it justice, you've gotta remember - there is NOTHING but scrub and sand in every direction from this thing.

Anyways, frankly, I find this CBP stop a little ""off putting"" as well, kinda wish it wasn't RIGHT at the park entrance.

"Here’s a handy guide to checkpoints from the [ACLU](https://www.acluaz.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/aclu_border_rights.pdf). 

If you want to take a deep dive into the law, read [United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/543/). There’s a recording of that hearing online too that’s interesting to listen to. 

In short, they are only allowed to ask you brief questions for the purpose of establishing citizenship, and take a quick peep through your window. You are also not obligated to answer. Your tags are beyond the scope of their duty and if they wanted to press it they would have to call CHP. 

It’s a good idea to record your interactions with Border Patrol. They are highly militarized and have a difficult time code switching when interacting with the public. As such, they have a tendency to overstep, especially at the more rural outposts. 

I work out there, so that checkpoint and the one in Palo Verde are the bane of my existence.

* *Do not camp farther than one car length from any dirt or paved road*
* *Park on the side of the road, so others may pass, but please do not trample vegetation or drive over geological formations.*
* *Ground fires are not permitted. Use a metal container to hold your fire.*
* *Pack it in, pack it out. Take trash away with you and dispose of it appropriately.*
* *Pets must be secured with a leash no longer than 6’ and are not permitted on hiking trails.*

"From experience, I can say that if a park ranger finds this, they'll destroy it.

We camped at a spot in Blair Valley a couple years back and a ranger stopped in to make sure we had our fire off the ground, etc.  On her way back to her truck, she spotted that someone had done a small cairn and carved a granite stone for their dog.

"I could be wrong, but isn’t Sandstone Canyon the wash coming down from Diablo drop off?  If so, it’s one way (west to east).  If you’re going from Fish creek, you’d be headed east to west so I wouldn’t recommend driving the narrow wash in the wrong direction.  I haven’t been on that wash in a few years, but that’s my recollection.

That said, if you’re asking about traveling on fish creek wash from Split Mtn road, then you’ll be fine in your vehicle.  Going into FCW, there are only two spots that I think you may have to worry about with lower clearance, but if you go slow and have a friend who can spot you on the rocks, you’ll be fine.  The good thing about FCW is that there are plenty of people out there (especially on a weekend) so if you get into any kind of trouble, there will be lots of vehicles who can assist you.  Be sure you have recovery points (somewhere to hook a strap) on the front AND back of your Sub, just in case you need a pull.

"So, I was hiking my way down a road, And I stumbled upon this weird looking car, it was mostly covered in dust and was incredibly rusty, the license plate expired 2 years ago and the doors were unlocked, but were bolted shut, and there was lots of vulgar things written in the dust on the car, does anyone know how long this car was here for, who it belonged to? The insides were full of old things and open cans of food.

Edit: I tried to run the license plate number and it turns out that the vehicle is a 2003 Toyota echo, it was reported stolen in Kentucky in 2009, I’m not even sure who to report it to.

Edit 2: I couldn’t help but take a look at the car again, As I’m visiting a friend who lives nearby, I called the local authorities and let them know about the car, and they told me they would send somebody down to look at it, anyways upon closer inspection, the door was bolted from the inside, as the door handle opens without issues and the locking mechanism was jammed closed, there is a huge pile of clothes and oddly enough, there was a ton of oatmeal sitting in the back seat, and there was a huge mass of towels and old clothes piled on top of each other in the backseat, I couldn’t help but wonder if someone was still inside there?

"Forced guy hit all the right points, as others have pointed out.

If you have a truck/SUV, you can drive down dirt roads and camp anywhere. Do not park your vehicle ON the dirt road- find an area where you can pull off the dirt road, but no more than 1 vehicle length -- basically, the minimum required to not block the dirt road. 

The Slot and Font's Point are great, but (a) I'd recommend a truck. People do it in cars, but I really wouldn't recommend it and (b) they're both great, and I've camped at both, but they'll have visitors during the day and I setup camp after sunset to avoid the crowd.

If you do not have a truck/SUV, there are still plenty of options. 

McCain Valley, Blair Valley, and Yaqui Pass are all good for cars. The first two have ""campsites"", free and no reservation. There's always availability. No firepits and no water, but there are pit toilets. Yaqi Pass doesn't have campsites, water, or even pit toilets - it's a HUGE hard-dirt parking lot, and that's it. It's meant to accommodate RVs, but I've never seen anyone there. Just find your little corner of the lot and setup.

"What is safe? Do you mean ""allowed by the park"" or ""safe from thieves?""

**Allowed**: As Jeff said, yes, basically anywhere that is not directly on the road and within 1 car-length of the road and not damaging vegetation. That's fine and allowed.

**Safe from thieves**: It's *extremely* rare to encounter any issues. However, if you have anything ""fancy"" on/in your vehicle (*after market rims, expensive looking equipment, etc..*), then I would advise that you don't leave it overnight within sight of a paved road. If you're down a dirt road away from the pavement, then I'm sure you're fine overnight. But if you're parked on the shoulder of a paved road where *non-park visitors* drive over-night AND your vehicle has something fancy, then you're at a small risk. I had someone steal all 4 of the wheels off my Nissan Sentra in 2016. I was parked at the Villager Peak Head trailhead. It had after-market rims. Pics: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidwkennedy/albums/72157662121281864](https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidwkennedy/albums/72157662121281864) \- now I have stock rims and I haven't had a problem at that trailhead overnight.

Edit: If you encounter any crime within the park, don't call the police -- they'll tell you that it's not their jurisdiction. Call the State Park Rangers. The park has lots of different employees, but the actual *Rangers* are legit cops and the park is their jurisdiction.

My family used to camp in one of the washes that run off of Fonts Wash that was called Ella Wash.

"forcedguy hit the main points.  It's not BLM though, it's state park.  But he has the rules right.  The big one is ""Vehicles must be parked no more than 1 vehicle length off the road. Do not trample
vegetation or drive over geological features.""

Anza is chock-full of random camp spots that are ""no reservation"" because they are kinda all over the place.  Just drive in any direction and keep your eyes peeled and you'll find something.  Arrive in the daytime though so you can see, don't hunt for spots at night.  Truck or high clearance helps tremendously.  

The experience is AMAZING!  You're not camped next to a ton of people and you're fully self-reliant.  Take shit ton of water and watch the weather before leaving.... you can get lucky in October and sometimes not too hot, you can also get unlucky.  Keep an eye on wind and rain as well, it's not just temp that can get you.  Culp Valley is a good spot if it's super hot because it's higher elevation.

"It's gonna be hot, most important thing is having water, since there won't be any provided. MINIMUM 2 gallons, per person, per day. It's all state park land so there are specific but generous camping rules.

* Do not camp farther than one car length from any dirt or paved road
* Do not camp within 100 feet of any water source
* There is no garbage collection outside developed campgrounds so pack-in pack-out
* Ground fires are not permitted, and NORMALLY metal containers must be used for all campfires, but heads up, fires aren't allowed right now, you'll need a permit and right now you probably can't get one because of the wildfire risk -- so if you want hot food, etc, bring a camp stove.

I personally enjoy [the slot canyon](https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/the-slot-anza-borrego-desert) area, you can camp pretty close to that location right on the dirt jeep road. I recommend car camping for this reason, i.e. using your car (ideally but not necessarily 4 wheel drive) as your mobile ""base"" and then sleeping in a tent near your car. Don't be the idiot who starts another wildfire accidentally. PACK OUT EVERYTHING AFTER, ""take nothing but photos, leave nothing but footprints"".

You might have better views from Julian/Mt.Laguna areas if you're only interested in stargazing.

I doubt backcountry camping will be open at the time of your trip-that being said-use Caltopo with the public land filter and find areas where BLM boarders the park.

"You could probably boondock on S22 east of the airport at the curve - private land that snowbirds stay on. or head out to the BLM land closer to the Salton Sea. I think Fish Creek is BLM east of Split Mountain but it could be sandy.

Last Friday I drove from scissors crossing to Ocotillo on S2 and the entire desert was shut down. Vallecito had the gate shut and Aqua Caliente looked closed too.  I think someone was parked way out in Blair valley and was possibly camping but I did not want to take the chance. We ended up boondocking in Plaster City but it was too windy to enjoy.

Take the 8 East, hope north on the 111, and continue east when you meet the 78. I \*believe\* that to be BLM land, but I'd encourage you to do your own research. Took about 2.5 hours to get there.

No great camping sites but tons of open land. Just drove a few miles down Vallecito Creek Wash on the way to the mud cages and scoped out a ton of flat possible campsites.

"Just to clarify, Anza Borrego is \*not\* BLM land.  There is BLM land nearby (to the east of Fish Creek, for example), but AB is a California State Park and is thus governed by different rules and overseen by different folks.

That said, ""almost anywhere"" is still a decent answer, but to truly avoid other people, you're going to have to work a bit.   Areas near campgrounds will likely be crowded (Blair Valley and LBV beyond the campground, for example), as will popular non-campground areas (the wash leading to Font's Point).  

If your vehicle has good ground clearance, capable tires, and maybe a locker or 4WD/AWD, you should be able to go most places in the park, so the best option will be to pick a more obscure trail and head down it until you find a good spot to pull off.  Many of the roads tagged as ""Primitive Road"" on this map are a good place to start, but again - be sure your vehicle is capable and that you're well prepared before setting off - I never would count on someone else to find you if you get stuck, and even less-so in the current situation.

"Expect nighttime temperatures to reach a low of 80 and daytime temps to be around 105.  Unless you have other more extensive desert hiking experience I would not suggest hiking in those conditions.  

If you absolutely must hike and cannot select a different season I suggest each person bring 2L of water to drink while on the hike.

Ensure that you are completely hydrated before you start.  Urine should be nearly clear.

Do not hike in places where you cannot call for help by radio or cell. 

Wear long light colored layers to help reduce the amount if water lost as sweat.  

DRINK YOUR WATER, it's better to drink the water early and make good time than it is to carry heavy water and become dehydrated.

Check in at a ranger station or fire dept to let them know when you will be heading out and when you will come back by.  Follow up with them at the end if you do this.

If you have a couple days I suggest working your way up to distance as well.  For instance, park 1/2 mile off the main road and make a round trip of 1 mile.  See how you feel and then trying something lo ger after you rest.
