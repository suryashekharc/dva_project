I tried contacting local companies, via Google, and had no luck for blow-in insulation this past Fall. I picked the 3 highest reviewed companies in our area.

1 wouldn't talk to me over the phone and directed me to their website but ended up having 2 different websites unbeknownst to me. I filled out the form on the first website and finally received a reply telling me to go to the other website to schedule a meeting. This was in October and the earliest available date they had was Dec 15th.

The last went right to voicemail explaining that they are merging with another company and not taking any new customers.

Finally, I turned to Home Advisor. Only 1 company from there replied. And they wanted to charge me $6k+.

"Just make sure you get a good system that you will be able to get replacement parts for. Since so much is imported, and with economic games being played by every country. Make sure you do not cut your nose to spite your face.

">""Gender affirming health care"" is the language used by the Texas law.   Talk therapy is health care, and is included in the Texas law as child abuse.

This is false on multiple levels.

The Texas ""law"" you appear to be concerned about is not a law at all, but rather a non-binding legal opinion issued by the Texas Attorney General.  It is here:  [https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/KP-0401.pdf?utm\_content=&utm\_medium=email&utm\_name=&utm\_source=govdelivery&utm\_term=](https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/KP-0401.pdf?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=)

There is also a letter issued by the Texas Governor directing the TX Dept. of Family and Protective Services to investigate potential child abuse.  That letter is here:  [https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/O-MastersJaime202202221358.pdf](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/O-MastersJaime202202221358.pdf)

Neither of these documents includes the phrase ""Gender affirming health care.""  Neither of them relates to talk therapy.

Both documents are concerned, explicitly and unmistakably, with ""gender reassignment surgeries"" and ""drugs that induce transient or permanent infertility.""  It's right there on the 1st page of the AG's opinion.

I will also note that earlier in this conversation, I asked whether your use of ""gender affirming health care"" included drugs and surgeries, and you said ""it includes everything."" 

Again, you seem to be sincere in your views on this.  And if your sole concern is access to talk therapy for kids, I don't think we have much disagreement (nor, ironically, do you disagree with the TX government officials you mentioned).  But that's not what you said earlier.  And if you want your opinions to be based on research, you should check the primary sources.

"“Agenda-driven therapy” isn’t sanctioned in any venue. 

I know that the birth control example is common. That’s kind of my point. I was started on hormone therapy as a minor but it was no big deal bc it had nothing to do with my gender. 

The APA doesn’t view being trans as being mentally ill, so saying such is scientifically inaccurate.

"“Gender affirming health care” is the language used by the Texas law. I specifically used that language to avoid this conversation.  

Talk therapy is health care, and is included in the Texas law as child abuse. If a parent brings a 10 year old girl who thinks she might be a boy to a therapist, the parents abs therapist could be brought up on criminal child abuse charges. No licensed health care professional who wants to remain licensed would perform surgery on a 10 year old girl. I don’t know enough about hormones, but they’re not drugs, and are also prescribed for reasons other than gender affirmation and confusion. 

The reason I said Travis County and not Austin was because to compare 1 city to the whole Hudson valley is off. Even outside of the city limits, Travis County is still super pricy. It’s a great area, but hard to live in, and even harder to relocate to now. 

I don’t intentionally spin or insinuate. I will say what I mean. I’m sorry that you disagree with me. But my opinion on this Texas law is based on research. If drugs and surgeries to small children were an actual thing, my opinion would be be much different. But it’s not. I’m sure it happens, in the same way that there are people in every profession that do illegal and dangerous things. I am most certainly against that. But whether you “agree” with kids knowing their gender or not,  it’s a point of confusion for the kid and denying them talk therapy is dangerous.

"Well, I'd say the idea of giving, say, a 10-year old girl, whose body is changing and who has other stress factors in her life, drugs or surgery because she thinks she might be trans, is pretty messed up -- and does not constitute ""health care,"" at least not until there has been a pretty exhaustive attempt to help the child through talk therapy or other means.  I think the vast majority of people, especially parents, agree with that view.

I also think that if you want to have a real conversation with someone, it's important to be honest.  Using Orwellian, politically engineered phrasing like ""denying certain people the right to live as themselves"" and ""gender affirming health care"" is not honest -- it's just an attempt to spin the discussion away from the troubling reality, which is giving impressionable and fickle young children drugs or surgery, thereby changing their physiology, in ways that can't be undone.

For that matter, it's not honest to compare real estate pricing in Travis County (i.e. Austin -- but you chose not to say Austin) to that in the HV.  Of course Austin costs more than the HV.  It's apples and oranges.

I don't doubt that your feelings about this issue are sincere.  But hiding the reality behind spin control, and insinuating that those who disagree with you are bigots, doesn't do anything to advance your view.

"Hi! I moved up to the Hudson Valley a while ago, but haven’t played any shows (for obvious reasons) since coming up. I would call my music (my band is called Stimmerman) experimental rock. It’s not shoegaze-y, but has garage-y and prog-y elements

"Typically, if you've bought a plant or tree from an online retailer, such as Gurney's, they won't begin shipping to a zone until it's safe to plant. I actually have blueberries and raspberries on order with Gurney's and they're due to ship late this month or in April. Your best bet is to ask the nursery that you purchased it from.

That said, for trees in general, the DEC says the following:

>late winter/early spring prior to buds opening, or late fall after the tree goes dormant but before the ground freezes.

[https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/5303.html](https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/5303.html)

Additionally, the following PDF from [Cornell.edu](https://Cornell.edu) states the following:

>Early spring is the best time to plant fruit trees. Plant as soon as you can after the soil has thawed and drained enough to work without destroying its structure and before your nursery stock starts to break bud and leaf out.

"I don't commute anymore but I moved up here expecting to commute. 

My advice is to pay attention to the TOTAL time and stress of commuting. For me, all I have to do to get to my (now nearly empty) office is walk to the metro north, and then walk from Grand Central. The actual trip is much more pleasant than the subway. (I was already spending an hour door to door on the F train.)  

Add any type of driving to or parking at the train station, and you've basically doubled the inconvenience. You need to be within walking distance of the train to make it feel like an outer borough commute. 

Check the train schedules when you're house hunting. There is basically one morning and evening option for me without transfers, where my commute door to door is under two hours. 

Also, use your company's transit benefits or request them.

"Hey u/pankuthankoo, always nice to run into a fellow (potential) Texpat! I'm originally from Houston but my roommate and I were living in San Antonio before we moved to Newburgh last summer for work. I'm sorry you are in a position where you have to explore relocating - I'm hopeful November will bring the necessary changes back home but not holding my breath. I do not have kids, so I cannot speak to the day care options but you still might find my experience useful. 

I will preface everything I’m about to say by pointing out that everyone has been incredibly friendly - as you can tell from the posts in this thread! 

With that said, I have found the Hudson valley to be incredibly expensive for the available amenities, lacking in diversity compared my community back in San Antonio, and  much more conservative than the spaces I lived in back in Texas. I’m strongly considering moving when my lease is up. Probably not back to Texas but certainly not in this area. I’m not sure where you are located so this may or may not be a good point of reference but I would equate the Hudson Valley to the smaller towns in the Hill Country - both the good and bad. Incredibly quaint and a great place to visit but if you are more accustomed to the convenience and lifestyle of urban or suburban life it will be a hard adjustment. Expensive, few amenities, long travel distances, not very diverse, etc. 

You mention you are looking to relocate due to the political situation in Texas. I do want to warn you - I’ve seen more MAGA flags, hats, and bumper sticks here in Newburgh than I ever did back home. It seems like during the height of the Omicron surge there were mask protests happening at least once a week. I just want to prepare you for that as it was a total shock to me! Before moving here, I never would’ve believed that more people voted for Biden in Texas than New York but now I can totally see it.

Ending on the positives - there are so many fun things to do outdoors and being able to experience seasons is a treat! So much fresh produce, the apple cider donuts are killer - almost makes up for no kolaches… almost :-)

Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions about the area or my experiences so far. Happy to buy you and your family a Shiner when you come up for your recon trip!

"Western Orange County isn’t talked about much, but it’s kind of a hidden gem. There were a few comments about Minisink having high taxes, but that’s going to be dependent on a few factors. Without getting too specific I have a large home, roughly two acres and my taxes are 7K minus the STAR credit and veterans exemption. I also live in Minisink.

Middletown is one of the “smaller” cities in the area, but it has the diversity you’d like and a lot of the neighboring towns (Mt Hope, Wawayanda) can be very affordable. It’s also going through a bit of a Renaissance right now with two major breweries (one which has gone national) and an Asian influx which is bringing even more diversity to the area. I think just mentioning food in regards to culture cheapens it a bit, but there’s literally an Indian, Asian and Hispanic food market in Middletown along with an Adam’s Fairacre farm coming soon which is another classic of the region.

If you follow rt 17 in OC, you’ll also hit on towns like Goshen & Chester, both of which I’m big fans of. Again people talk about taxes, but with enough research you most likely can find a house within your budget.

Schools. I’ll rep Minisink bc my kids go there and we specifically chose the area for its strong schools, but Washingtonville & Goshen are also great. Pine Bush is a a decent school, albeit large, and it’s a very cute small town. I will say it’s tough to break into PB though, and the parts of the school district that are Ulster might be cheaper.

For cute town factors I’d vote Pine Bush, Goshen, Washingtonville. Hell I’ll throw Chester in for Sugar Loaf. Pine Bush is also VERY community oriented, having what seems like an endless amount of festivals on Main st, to include an alien festival. Did I mention it also has a UFO museum?

Anyway, I love to rep the HV and specifically OC, so if you have questions you can message me too.",t2_7jm5l,sonaked,0,1647298615.0,0,t1_i0ofsmu,i0ofsmu,True,pankuthankoo,t3_te1a53,https://www.reddit.com/r/hudsonvalley/comments/te1a53/diversity_in_the_hudson_valley/,Diversity in the Hudson Valley,/r/hudsonvalley/comments/te1a53/diversity_in_the_hudson_valley/i0ofsmu/,2,r/hudsonvalley,0,2

"I grew up in the Hudson Valley, large part in Kingston, then I lived in Texas 30 years, and I now am splitting my time between the Hudson valley and Texas. I will breakdown the lifestyle differences between the two places. I am black, married to a Cuban, so I am aware of diversity in both places and what that means. I am not sure what part of Texas you are coming from, but I am from Austin if that helps. I did live out in Prairie View and Pearland near Houston for a while as well.

I'll answer your questions one by one from my Texan/New Yorker perspective. 

* **We want a safe place that our child will feel loved**. - This will vary widely from place to place. If you are in Kingston, look into the Woodstock area for a hippy school if feeling loved is important to you, because as a New Yorker I can tell you, we can be very cold and kind of rough around the edges. When I am in NY I seriously miss southern hospitality. My parents sent me to a hippy school in Woodstock for two years because the Kingston elementary school just wasn't very good. You are going to have to do your homework to find a place that works for you. In Austin, I was able to find a great hippy pre-school for my kid and got right in. I tried it in New York, and there were seriously long waiting lists at a couple of the places I wanted. 

* **Diversity**- Hispanic culture in the New York area is largely Caribbean based, so my Cuban spouse loved the food in the NY area. So you can't find great tacos in the HV area, but you are going to find great picadillo. But make no mistake, there are some serious white areas. For a few years of my schooling, I was one of only a couple black kids in my entire school. You are going to have to do your homework to find diverse areas, schools and neighborhoods. You can have seriously Hispanic or black areas in some places, and you can have hardcore Trump-loving white areas in others. Driving up and down route 9 it is not uncommon to see a diesel truck with Let's Go Brandon flags next to a Prius with a Love is Love rainbow sticker on it. It's a lot like Austin in that respect to be honest.

* **Public schools**- Very hit or miss. I spent half my childhood in public school and half in private school. Kingston suffered greatly when it lost a good chunk of its population due to layoffs from IBM in the 1990s. Although not the only way to rate schools, Great Schools will give you a good idea. [Here is Kingston](https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/kingston/schools/), notice how none of the public school are rated very highly, [here is Austin](https://www.greatschools.org/texas/austin/schools/), tons of highly rated schools. 

* **Cute little town vibe**.- Downtown Kingston is cute, but there are tons of cute downtown areas, don't limit yourself to Kingston if you don't have to. There's Rhinebeck, Highland, Hyde Park, tons of great cute places. 

Here are the pros of moving from Texas to the Hudson Valley-

* Natural beauty- You have the Catskill mountains and the Adirondacks just a couple hours north, so there is lots of natural beauty. There are great parks to take your kids to and enjoy views of the Hudson. 

* Proximity to New York City- this opens up tons of activities. Music, Museums, Sports, etc. The Bronx zoo is amazing, but I often take my kid to Central Park Zoo. The Met is an amazing experience for people of all ages, the list goes on.

* History- I love taking my kid to French/Indian war sites, Revolutionary war sites, etc. 

* Pizza- Pizza is just better in NY, it is one of the things I miss most when I am in Texas.

* Bagels- Same as pizza.

Here are the cons of moving to NY from Texas:

* Cost of living- NY is just more expensive in a lot of ways. You have state income tax, which when you run the numbers, is significant. You are going to pay around 6%. Also, groceries are more expensive. There is no HEB equivalent in New York, although Price Chopper and their ""Market 32"" re-brand makes an effort. I do prefer Adams in the HV to Whole Foods in TX, only because Adams tends to be a bit cheaper than Whole Foods. But overall everything tends to be more expensive, gas and groceries. 

* Winter- A couple weeks of winter is novel, but after a couple months it can get old really fast. Life just gets more difficult when there is snow, ice and mud everywhere. You are limited to indoor activities for a lot of things because of the weather. That's not to say that Texas weather doesn't have its drawbacks. Right now I stay in New York June to December, so I get some snow, but I avoid January and February in NY. But I would much rather be in NY in July and August, because Texas sucks those months. 

* Housing- Housing in NY tends to be older and you don't get as much for your dollar, depending on where you are moving from in Texas. This isn't necessarily the case for me coming from Austin, since the market here has exploded, but if you are coming from one of the more affordable suburbs in Texas, you might struggle to find someone as nice in NY dollar for dollar. This can be offset by finding a cute older house in NY, but maintenance is a pain on the older houses. 

So the final issue you raised- government. I left Texas for the Hudson Valley because I hated Texas COVID policy, or lack thereof, so there is something to be said for NY on that front. On the other hand, one of the annoying things about NY is that it is like California, it is a bit of a nanny state. The one thing I love about Texas is that you tend to have more freedom in some areas. For example, there are a lot more rules about camping in New York than there are in Texas. I can just drive down to the national seashore and pitch a tent on the beach. There just aren't as many places to do stuff like that in NY. In fact, you will see that places in NY just have more rules in general than places in Texas, which again, can be a double edged sword, there is good and bad about it. 

One final thought- the major difference you will notice between Texas and NY is that in Texas most cities are growing in population and thriving, [while in the HV most cities are either stagnant, or slowly declining in population](https://www.google.com/search?q=kingston+new+york+population&oq=kingston+new+york+pop&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i512j0i22i30l2j0i390l3.7636j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). There are people from NYC moving up to the HV, so cities like Beacon or Rhinebeck will be growing, but overall things are kind of flat population wise. Here you can see a graph of [Poughkeepsie, Newburgh and New Paltz, all places that are rather stagnant](https://www.google.com/search?q=poughkeepsie+population&oq=poughkeep&aqs=chrome.0.0i67j69i57j0i67j46i67i433j0i67l3j46i433i512j0i67l2.3394j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). You can definitely notice this in the energy of the cities, so depending on where you are coming from, it can feel a little strange.",t2_55nn5,urstillatroll,0,1647295296.0,0,t1_i0o839d,i0o839d,True,pankuthankoo,t3_te1a53,https://www.reddit.com/r/hudsonvalley/comments/te1a53/diversity_in_the_hudson_valley/,Diversity in the Hudson Valley,/r/hudsonvalley/comments/te1a53/diversity_in_the_hudson_valley/i0o839d/,16,r/hudsonvalley,0,16

"Hudson Valley isn’t Waspy in the Anglo sense like parts of New England and the South.  As others have said, the “white” people here are pretty diverse - Italians, Irish, Germans, Albanians, etc.. still some old Dutch families.  Probably more people with native ancestry than you’d think.  Lots of African- Americans in cities like Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, Peekskill, and used to be in Beacon although they’ve been one of the demographics hardest hit by gentrification. There are black families who go centuries back and others who came up from the South last century… lots of Jewish Americans, especially the closer to NYC you get, but there are major Hasidic communities in Orange and Rockland County… somewhat controversial neighbors.  As far as Latin populations go, there are actually many in the lower HV, even in the small towns.  Peekskill has a big Ecuadorian population, Poughkeepsie Mexican, Danbur Brazilian, Beacon used to be Dominican…. It’s a great area but it’s cities are similar to NYC in that people stay in their own nighborhoods a little bit. I’d encourage you to give NY white people a chance, the ones that are from here know a lot about the area and are generally more tolerant than you might think.

"I'm very sorry about the political situation in TX. I expect many ppl who love their kids and value democracy are in the same situation as you. 

I moved to New Paltz after 15 yrs in California. It wasn't a total culture shock, b/c I grew up in Syracuse, NY, but I can say that it feels like a different world in every way from Los Angeles. NP is one of the more diverse towns/villages in the area, b/c of the college, but it's still incredibly white. Housing is very difficult to find, and prices/taxes are very high. Home buyers are often outbid by wealthy NYC ppl who are buying a weekend home or ""escape home"" for the next pandemic. Schools are mostly good, but not exceptional. New Paltz teachers and parents tend to be on the progressive side, on balance, but like everywhere there are ppl from the other side of the political aisle. There tends to be a lot of drama, and turnover of school administrators is high. Thankfully, NY State values education, and so we are in better shape than a lot of states. 

Most of the truly rural areas in between Hudson Valley towns are Trump territory. Summer and fall are gorgeous, but winter here is very gray and bleak, and lasts for 5 months. Jobs are very hard to come by here b/c the population density is lower than other areas. Be very careful about job prospects in your field before you make a move. Many types of industries are simply not represented at all in this area, and if you end up commuting to NYC, it is a huge time-suck.  If you have never lived in the Northeast, I would be careful of uprooting your family before you are totally sure. There are so many places out west that are more progressive and safe than Texas that you might not need to risk such an expensive move. Just food for thought!

"Kingston is a very large area and has three distinct sections, or districts, and I think between all of them will check most of your boxes.

1. Downtown aka Rondout. Has the historic cute little town by the water vibe. Antique shops, some boutiques, a handful of good restaurants. Mostly white and mostly older crowd.
2. Midtown. More of a small city feel. Very walkable. Also just renovated the main road, a massive project which added a protected bike lane. Many mexican eateries, and also keegan ales, one of the most well-known breweries in the HV is nearby. Probably the most diverse area of kingston.
3. Uptown aka Stockade District. Historic area with a mix of high end restaurants and boutiques, and some mid range food options, 2 record stores, a new wine bar opening soon, etc. Stockade probably has the most character, a mostly younger ""hipstery"" crowd, and gets busy on weekends, probably because the busses from the city disembark a block away.  


I know Texas has some great mexican food and NY cannot compare, but there are many solid spots in Kingston. But hey, we have better pizza!

"So nothing is perfect... but I do think you'll find its more expensive here than in TX- maybe not in taxes, but electric cost, gas cost, etc.  general cost of living.

New Paltz is a great area- smallish town with lots of people walking around and drive 20 mins to some Catskill mountain areas. 

One thought for you could be Fishkill, NY.  It is pretty good- has a downtown- public schools are- ok.   The thing about Fishkill is that you could find townhouses to purchase.  That could get you a foothold in the area and then spend the next couple of years looking around to find your final town/location.   Something like this: [https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/15-Aspen-Ct\_Fishkill\_NY\_12524\_M32747-25663](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/15-Aspen-Ct_Fishkill_NY_12524_M32747-25663)

These flip pretty fast, so if you get one you kinda know that you should be able to sell it pretty quick when you're ready for your final home (that's what I did).

Also Fishkill is a few mins drive from the Beacon Train station, which is the Hudson Train line into NYC.  Whenever I moved into an area I always tried to figure out if the economy crashes, how do I find work. NYC is a decent job well- though it would be a 1.5 hr each way train commute- but at least it goes right into the city.

The end of the line for commuting into NYC by train is Poughkeepsie-  but Poughkeepsie has good areas and less good areas (same as Newburgh). 

Keep in mind- generally trains on the east of the Hudson River go into NY City- while trains on the west side of the Hudson River go to NJ- and then you have to cross from there.

"I've spent the majority of my life in the Hudson Valley and I love it. You'll find some locals who are resistant to ""transplants"" from NYC or other areas, because there is definitely a high demand for housing and rising prices due to an influx of people moving here, as well as a lot of gentrification happening, but I personally don't begrudge anyone looking for a better quality of life and I think most people are welcoming. Kingston is a good start when looking for a diverse area, but the surrounding and more rural areas of the Hudson Valley can be a lot less so. I wouldn't call it waspy though.  You'll find some very conservative neighbors in some of the rural areas. The further upstate in New York you go, the more conservative it gets (except for larger cities). All states have their issues, but it's not Texas and the state government is generally pretty reasonable in my opinion. Cute little town vibe brings to mind New Paltz, Rosendale, Saugerties, Beacon. New Paltz is probably my favorite town personally. Make a point to visit these areas on your trip if you can. Bigger and more diverse would be Kingston, Poughkeepsie. The City of Newburgh is diverse, but there are crime concerns in some areas and I'd be hesitant about the schools. I can't speak to daycare options personally. Be aware that demand is high so the ""cute little towns"" you're looking to find are going to be pretty expensive to buy property in. And competition is high. But for families, you really can't beat the Hudson Valley. Close enough to NYC, generally great schools, plenty of cultural activities/art museums/colleges, lots of outdoor recreation opportunities, and also local farms, apple picking, farmers' markets, etc. Be ready for high property taxes in NY.

"Here is the rest of this story:  
  
Alexander King didn't like how he was treated when Brewster police Officer Fernando Quinones gave him a traffic ticket one afternoon last fall.  
  
So King went to police headquarters to file a civilian complaint against Quinones, prompting a confrontation in the parking lot that ended with King's arrest.  
  
A short video recording of the encounter, made by King, appears to show Quinones with his hand at King's neck and raises questions about the officer's account in the criminal charges.  
  
King now intends to sue Brewster, the police department and Quinones, alleging false arrest and excessive force and accusing the cop of filing a false complaint to cover up what he contends was the wrongful arrest.  
  
District Attorney Robert Tendy would not comment on the state police probe, but said there was still an ongoing investigation by his office.  
  
A screenshot from a cellphone video taken by Alexander King shows Brewster police Officer Fernando Quinones with his right hand at King's neck during an arrest in the parking lot at police headquarters on Oct. 28, 2021.  
  
Quinones faced no discipline and likely will not based on the investigation, police Chief John Del Gardo told The Journal News/lohud. Mayor James Schoenig, shown the video on March 2, defended the officer's actions and said he thought the video showed Quinones grabbing King by the shoulder, not the neck.  
  
""That's a tactic you use to arrest somebody,"" Schoenig said. ""Does Freddy's hand slide? You can't tell.""  
  
Shortly before 3 p.m. on Oct. 28, 2021, Quinones pulled King over on Route 22 and gave him a ticket for using a cellphone while driving. Schoenig said the body cam footage from the traffic stop included King getting out of his car and going to his trunk despite the officer's directive to stay inside.  
  
There was no alleged crime at the scene. But according to the criminal complaint Quinones later filed, King yelled profanities and made obscene gestures at him and then followed the officer back to headquarters. In the parking lot, the officer claimed, King again cursed at him and told him he was waiting for his lawyer.  
  
As King walked to the police station, Quinones pulled up in his patrol car and got out.  
  
""I'd watch what you do, I'm going in to see your supervisor,"" King warned Quinones, according to the video.  
  
The video shows Quinones then grabbed at the cellphone and moved to arrest King, with his hand near King's neck before getting King to the ground.  
  
King was handcuffed and taken inside. He was charged with third-degree attempted assault, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.  
  
But in the court document, he claimed to have told King that the chief was inside to take the complaint and that the ""Defendant then advanced at officer with his fist clenched yelling (two-word expletive)."" Quinones, ""fearing for his safety,"" then told King to get on the ground, that he was under arrest. The officer claimed to have grabbed King by the shirt and pulled him down to control him.  
  
Whatever King may have said initially in the parking lot, the video did not show him utter any expletive right before the officer became aggressive. And while the recording does not show King's hands the entire time, it does show him holding car keys and a driver's license in his right hand and the phone in his left.  
  
King said he managed to turn the phone off as he was on the ground – otherwise he believes Quinones would have been able to erase the video.  
  
The recording, though limited, does appear to back up King's version of events and suggests that ""the officer was the aggressor"" in this instance, according to Gideon Orion Oliver, a New York City-based civil rights attorney who frequently handles cases involving police misconduct. (He is not connected to this case.)  
  
""The narrative that the officer gave in the last few sentences of the \[criminal\] complaint was about the alleged physical aggression,"" he noted. ""We just don't see that in the video. It's just not there.""  
  
Oliver said that police officers are generally trained on a use-of-force continuum, where the expectation is that they will deploy less aggressive tactics before escalating into more serious displays of force.  
  
The Brewster Police Department is located at the corner of Main Street and Peaceable Hill Road.  
  
Quinones previously pulled King over during a traffic stop on Oct. 4. After King drove off, Quinones went to his Brewster home to give him additional tickets for how he pulled away. King wasn't there but his father then brought him to headquarters, where he was charged with reckless driving, after Quinones said he had fishtailed away from the traffic stop, ran a red light and sped off.  
  
The notice of claim alleges that Quinones assaulted him at that time. King said that Quinones hit his head against a wall while he was handcuffed to a bench.  
  
King suggests that Del Gardo, who was present at the time, knew his officer was out of line because he told Quinones to just release King on a desk appearance ticket.  
  
Del Gardo said last week that was not the case, that he just wanted King out of the station because he was unruly.  
  
""It was mind-boggling,"" Del Gardo said. ""He was on our bench screaming his head off.""  
  
Del Gardo said last week he had not been informed the state police had wrapped up their probe. Quinones has faced no disciplinary action as a result of King's complaint and Del Gardo said he almost certainly wouldn't if cleared of criminal wrongdoing.  
  
But the chief acknowledged that the first time he saw the entirety of King's recording was last week when reporters showed it to him. He said he had previously only viewed a snippet shown him by state police.  
  
He was noncommittal about the recording. And he wouldn't answer specific questions about it while the investigation was pending.  
  
""Officers some times have to do things when making an arrest, if the person isn’t wanting to be arrested,"" he commented.  
  
King had taken the video he captured on his cellphone to state police but said he wasn't surprised they chose not to charge Quinones.  
  
""It's the Blue backing the Blue,"" King said.  
  
A day after a cordial conversation about the case in his office with The Journal News/lohud, Del Gardo was at the front desk when he told a reporter he was refusing to talk further about it, suggesting the press ""twists his words.""  
  
Two other police officers at the desk area reiterated that the chief wasn't supposed to say anything. One even shuttled the chief into his office after Del Gardo said he hadn't been told the investigation was closed.  
  
The mayor, Schoenig, said the department handled the matter properly by letting an outside agency investigate King's claim to show it wasn't ""being brushed under the carpet."" He said he supported Quinones and that his actions were justified if state police found no crime was committed.  
  
The mayor said that after hearing the witness' account and seeing King's behavior on the body cam footage, ""I'm leaning very favorably towards my cop.""

"Not a fight, but courtship, in Saugerties. Six short seconds of action here, tumbling toward Earth, as seen from Saugerties Beach, today, early afternoon.  
They broke off the death grip as they approached the tree line, and both sailed off, presumably, hearts pounding. This is courtship, after all.  
This pair was among seven eagles circling high, a mix of mature bald eagles and younger, brown-plumaged juveniles. Great show.  
Tech note: Shot with a 400mm tele on a monopod, and heavily cropped.  
From Birdnote.org:  
""Two eagles locking talons high above the ground might look like they're risking injury, but it's a normal courtship behavior called the “cartwheel display.” Fully entangled, the two birds begin spinning to the earth, disengaging just before they smack the ground.""

My husband and I (and our three yorkies) live in Hunter with a view of the mountain :) we had our Swiss chalet style home as a weekend ski place while living in the East Village in the city and then Pandemic-fled to live here full time. Very small-town but good restaurants due to the ski hill. Influx of tourists on the weekend. We really like it but it is a 40 minute drive to the nearest good grocery store. I like Catskill as an option to Hudson.
