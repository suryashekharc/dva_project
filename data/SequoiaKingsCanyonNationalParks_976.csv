"I lived in San Diego for 13 years and have driven every conceivable route from SD to Lone Pine, and some that are inconceivable.  For several trips into the Sierra, I recommended that partners fly into Vegas, and picked them up & dropped them off there.     

DVNP is an amazing place, especially if it's your first experience of the desert.   Going from Badwater to the summit of Whitney is kind of classic.  July is brutal, though. 

There is usually enough traffic congestion in the LA basin to add an hour or more to the driving time.  Getting in and out of Vegas is always a breeze.    

For LA to Lone Pine, the shortest route (14) is kind of tedious. I prefer 395, or really any other route.

Mineral King is intense without snow... you can't attempt any of those passes in May without self arrest skills.  Lower elevation loop def recommended.  Day 1 - Lakes trailhead to Pear Lake (5.6mi).  Day 2 - Pear Lake to Mehrten Meadow (6.2mi).  Day 3 - Day hike up Alta Peak and camp at Mehrten Meadows again (5.4mi).  Might need spikes for Alta but it's a fairly easy trail without dangerous exposure.  Day 4 - You can hike south to the HST and hike out to Crescent Meadow (8mi) or follow Alta Trail back to the Lakes trailhead (5.5mi).  Just one idea but I've done this route and it's pretty awesome.

"While this season is likely to be another dry one, we have had enough snow to cover the passes. I have hiked over black rock in June, this requires a good knowledge of the area, an ice axe and shoe spikes. I wouldn't do this for your first hike in the area, not only because of the difficulty in hiking over snow and ice but also because of how easy it is to loose the trail when hiking in those conditions. There are a lot of cliffs very close to the trail on this route. The cliff creek crossing can especially be hazardous. If you plan on going early, go ""clockwise"" and be ready to turn back if the creek is too high for you to safely cross. It would be disastrous to be a so close to returning to the trailhead going ""counterclockwise"" and find the creek too dangerous to cross. 
Lastly I want to advise to become more familiar with the area. This popular route is not a signed loop, and you will need to choose the correct direction at each turn.

"In 2018 I hiked the PCT, another year that had about 60% snow conditions in the Sierra. I entered the Sierra on June 5th, made it to the Rae lakes area on June 14th. When I got to Glen Pass, I was pretty terrified, even after doing forester pass. Early season snow conditions were still very prevalent. Descending Glen was not fun - I ended up falling a couple of times, the trail was not able to be followed so it was basically a scramble down between snow, rocks, and the sandy grit covering the granite, which is super slippery when wet. Forester pass was much easier a few days prior, mind you, and it’s higher. Maybe it would be better ascending Glen in these conditions. Glen was my least favorite of all the passes I went through in the snow.

My year there was also a snowstorm that came in and left about 1-2 fresh inches of snow Memorial Day weekend. 

All of this to say that there were PCTers in the Sierra at that time (late May) and it is doable, but I would be carrying microspikes and ice axes and actually know how to self arrest. If you are experienced mountaineers, you wouldn’t bat an eye at the conditions, but if you have no snow experience, I was recommend against it. If you are looking for it to be “open” by the end of May, I’m assuming you mean no snow on the trail, and that will just not happen. You’d need the snow levels to be more on par with the 2015 winter.

Another thing that never seems scary is the water runoff and creek flow, but that actually kills more people than snow accidents. Water runoff levels will most likely be at their highest around this time, and the bridge over the south fork of the kings river is still out. It’s a long ford, and can be very powerful. So another thing to consider. 

But if you’re looking for snow free, south facing slopes under 10k ft will be your best bet.",t2_znhn5,hikergal17,0,1647872633.0,0,t1_i1j7fh0,i1j7fh0,True,the-fris,t3_tizcc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEKI/comments/tizcc8/rae_lakes_loop_in_late_may/,Rae Lakes Loop in late May?,/r/SEKI/comments/tizcc8/rae_lakes_loop_in_late_may/i1j7fh0/,2,r/SEKI,0,2

A small hybrid SUV would be far preferable in my view, the proximity to SNF means you have access to a wide range of hiking opportunities off the beaten path.

"I’ve never been asked to show chains when going into Kings Canyon in over 7 years. I don’t carry them either. Keep in mind doing this is breaking federal law so that may not be something you want to do. Though the ticket isn’t anything extreme, and that’s IF they give it to you. $100ish. 

I should also say I have well over 20 years of snow driving experience and grew up/live in the snow. 

No rental company will allow chains, and the other types of chains they have out there, like socks or something don’t really work. If you have a vehicle with AWD or 4x4 you will definitely be okay. 

As others have said, take it slow, keep more distance, and don’t panic stop. If you start to slide get off the brake and slowly try again. Most people crash because they take turns too fast or jam up on the brakes and go into a skid. 

They keep the roads pretty clean up there so you shouldn’t have an issue. Just make sure you don’t pull into areas where they’ve plowed snow into. Or haven’t plowed. There could be something under the snow you don’t see.

"If there is chain control in effect, if you are driving all wheel drive or 4-wheel drive with tires rated for snow (many are) then you will be required to carry chains but not necessarily put them on (in fact, usually not). If you have 2-wheel drive, you will be required to put the chains on. Now, there is a decent chance no one will be there to stop you and make you use or have chains. But, without chains there is a pretty good chance you will end up in a snow bank with 2wd and little experience.

As for driving in snow, take it slow, keep plenty of space between you and the next car, use a lower gear to slow the car instead of brakes when possible. If you start sliding, do not panic. Essentially, you want to avoid sudden turns or braking. All that will do is put you in a slide you won't be able to control. Patience is the key.

If you purchase chains through Les Schwab, they allow you to return them if they have been unopened. 

Looking at the Grant Grove and Lodgepole forecasts, I do not think you are likely to have an issue. The temps look like they are going to be rather warm (40s) and there is not snow in the forecast for next week.

"I'd recommend getting chains/cables for your car.

Imo, February is a great time to go. There's no one around. The air is clean because there are no fires.

"What is and is not open in Sequoia National Park has a lot to do with the weather of the day before. It will be difficult/impossible to plan on what WILL be open more than a week out. This is because the fire burned across the highway along multiple areas and during weather events, the park closes the road to reduce the risk of anyone getting stuck/hit by a land/mudslide. When the road closes it can close at Hospital Rock or the entrance station it just depends on the weather. Either closure location would result in not being able to see the Sequoia trees within Sequoia National Park. Although Hospital Rock is a very interesting and beautiful place to visit.

1) Without weather, you can drive all the way up to the Sequoia trees and there's lots of walking around there :) the beauty is incredible along the whole drive. 

2) The drive from Visalia to the sequoia trees in Sequoia National Park is about 1.5 hours. 

3) Weather changes every year. Last year, the end of Feb was pretty snow-free, but historically the park should be under 20 feet of snow at that time. This year is supposed to be dryer than last year :( 

4) air is beautiful throughout the winter :D 

Additional thoughts- You may want to plan your trip for Kings Canyon instead of Sequoia. The road into Kings Canyon was not burned and is far more consistently open. About the same drive time from Visalia although there are closer towns/cities (Sanger for a town, Fresno for a city). Tons of beautiful fully grown sequoias live within Grant Grove, just inside Kings Canyon :) Essentially Sequoia is the southern entrance and Kings is the west entrance to the same very large park.

"I would check out the NPS site so you have a good idea of what they have. [NPS website- all information for people who have never been here/have no idea what it is like here.](https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/backpacking.htm) IDK what the difference between established and designated **backcountry** sites would be. established sounds more like a campground site.

Its important you only camp in designated campsites. There are rarely fire rings in the backcountry of this park and you shouldn't make them. There are no perm tent pads like in a campground and you shouldn't make them. There are rarely pit toilets in the backcountry and no flush toliets- be prepared to pack it all out. There are rarely animal-proof food storage cabinets in the backcountry and you should bring your own bear can for your food.

Some really great backpacking for all levels exsists in Sequoia and Kings canyon though and it's a great place to get your feet wet/backpack the rest of your life. 

The great thing about the mineral king is the valley and high peaks all around, but it's a high elevation valley so the oxygen is already thin when you park your car.

"Short answer is yes, but learning to snowboard short run or hill you have to boot pack will be hard. Also back country skiing and snowboarding is nuanced.  

My advise if this is something you want to get serious about is go to china peak and get comfortable on lift accessable groomed runs. Once you get that, take an Avalanche 1 coarse and buy the needed avalanche gear and get a friend that is also well equipped and then go.

Even if you arent that serious about back country stuff and want to hike a hill near a road and go down it on your board, learning to stay up, steer, and stop is alot harder on ungroomed snow. Yes it's possible and you can have fun but the learning curve is far steeper. And if you arent capable of stopping or turning a hill full of trees will be dangerous.

Wolverton Ski hill (sequoia side) is a good suggestion but access is limited currently. 

The road to panoramic point (grant area) is typically groomed with a snow cat to keep access to the cell towers and would be a good option to learn on. 

I used to go with friends to a hill near quail flat when I was younger to do short runs and build kickers.

Their are lots of marked ski trails in the front and back country of Seki but more for crosscountry skiing and snowshoeing.

I would again suggest learning on an actual ski resort with groomed runs and staffed with ski patrol.

"Honestly, anything out of Cottonwood fits the bill for ""intro to Eastern Sierra"". It can get crowded and seem like a lot at the trailheads, but I rarely run into too many people while hiking - it's a big area, people are all over - but you can camp near people easily (or not) or just day hike it. I just day hiked last visit, Lakes one day, Pass the next. The two trailheads have camping but they are supposed to be for single use prior to entry overnight (I might have... slept in the lot, shhh). Last visit was HOT days and COLD nights - south can be brutally hot, over 80 at 10k, but fall to below 40 still. Spring is flowers, early summer is mosquitos, late summer is hot, rest is either cold or snow - the passes to Langley are not great in high snow years sometimes well into summer due to cornices (danger!) but that only matters for summits, can still visit and have a blast.

It's spread out but you won't ever feel alone unless you hit a side trail. You won't go for more than a half hour without seeing someone in the main Pass and Lakes trails, maybe 2 hours outside them max - always someone around (sometimes pack trains of horses). The Pass trail hits PCT pretty fast (which I found pretty boring for a loop back south and east, lovely meadow views aside, though it was hot that day, but Chicken Spring Lake is cool going north, I stayed there once and views just up from it are great - 6 miles one way with moderate incline but well maintained/easy trail), and the Lakes between main 4 and 5, below Old Army Pass, is typically a crowd of tents - the main lakes is where everyone tends to be (typically planning a Mt Langley summit - it's worth it once: views are astounding and it is a total moonscape up there - vast and mean and lovely with a sharp drop east, but all use trails, and I far prefer New Army Pass and staying away from the crowds near lakes on that side).

The only caveat is the road hits 10,000 ft so even though it's possible to do very little gain hiking, you'll be at high altitude the entire time. Lone Pine is just a drive down to the desert, but unlike other roads this one doesn't have car camping places along the way. Often I've seen gliders take off from the roadside turnoffs, I've also seen giant rock slides trap people up there for a few hours (rare) after a quake or a heavy rain. fun, right?

edited to say: I do winter, but not ski, so more like tromp around until I am sick of postholing or glassiding. Overnights I usually wait early spring: all snow but warmer temps. Actually, this last year was the first time outside of Pear Lake I'd done SEKI in the winter proper (twin lakes and around Panther / HST). Snow really clears out those trails! Almost no one, sometimes no footprints in days old snow. (I like being alone, so not seeing anyone for 16 hours or more is my idea of heaven)",t2_hg16a,terraelise,0,1634113468.0,0,t1_hgglafh,hgglafh,False,[deleted],t3_q3mvjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEKI/comments/q3mvjx/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/SEKI/comments/q3mvjx/deleted_by_user/hgglafh/,1,r/SEKI,0,1

"Oof, I typed too much, warning.

I adore Redwood Mountain, and living without it for a while, or ever if damage is that bad, is very depressing.

It's amazing that both of us didn't get to Redwood Canyon, and it's unknown that status - I mean, the fire made it to Atwell. ug!

I love the HST views and flowers and where it leads, but, man, that loss and gain is very annoying - I haven't done the connector trail and maybe I'm glad I haven't! In the High Sierra Topix forums, one couple just tried the abandoned trail on the other side of the creek (what you look at from both trails) and it was, as you'd think, gone so mostly bushwacking - fun? That's all burned up now - I wonder if crews remade any old pack trails or if these trails are destroyed and pending rebuild. Maybe the quickest way back is to join volunteer groups to rebuild the trails.

As stunning as Yosemite is, the crowds are a bummer even if you quickly leave them behind backpacking (honestly, after 4 miles there's nobody) and now that SEKI is off limits for a while, I figure worse. Probably first place I'll hit in SEKI is way down in the canyon - my Bubbs Creek / Forester Pass / Sherman Pass goals were thrwarted twice this year by Inyo closure then the fire.

Eastern: there is NO shortage of trails. If you have a specific type you like, I can give something more specific... Since you have to drive around, Cottonwood (Pass or Lakes, Lakes being more fun to scout side trails) and Whitney Portal (Meysan or just to Lone Pine Lake on the main trail, the trail in the foothills is closed due to a recent fire, but that was lovely to do) out of Lone Pine and Onion Valley (must say Kearsarge is the best, the other two are a bit much and you might hate but glad you did once) out of Independence offer a wide variety of short and long,  connecting loops, summits and lakes, etc. Problems are: off season the roads close, on season everyone from my neck of the woods (LA or OC) fill up the parking lots quick so it's best to go on a Thursday or Friday to start trips. Even in winter with roads closed, it's a good snow hike test and the wee hikes to lakes that were 3 miles turn into 6 or more. Good news is day hiking only is pretty easy as there are a ton of campsites in the desert and nearly no one around when there is snow! Early spring it's great: open roads, warm weather, thawing flowers, but snow everywhere and, just like the west in higher elevation, frozen lakes and stunning views. Winter is just a bit longer and harsher on the east - but the Lakes Trail (Pear Lake) can be pretty brutal, so it's comparable - ditto mosquito issues early summer. For the east, CalTopo website is great for looking around. 

If you really want a drive, North Lake, Sabrina, and South Lake out of Bishop is \*the\* primo location, IMO, and there is no hike I've not liked. I spent this year doing the non-main trails and loved every single one - often the only person that kept going after the rest stopped at lakes so easy to avoid the main trail crowds. 

Bonus: autumn colors first half of October are stunning from Big Pine to Mammoth, and that Bishop area is routinely the best. That is something the west doesn't really have... though dogwoods in May is similarly lovely and special. I wonder how those fair after a fire? Aspens send up shoots really quick and wee 2 foot tall autumn leaves show up the year after a fire.

Since you are on the west, though, have you spent time driving in to Lake Edison? I know that terrible fire near Shaver / snow resort mucked up that area a bit, but VVR is a drive that is nearly east (but only for next summer) with amazing trails - just a hassle to drive to but there is a lot on the way and it feels more foothill-ish with creeks and forests vs east where you can often end up on the moon (rock fields above 12k aren't barren, lots of wee flowers, but it's not for everyone).",t2_hg16a,terraelise,0,1634063156.0,0,t1_hgduiij,hgduiij,False,[deleted],t3_q3mvjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEKI/comments/q3mvjx/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/SEKI/comments/q3mvjx/deleted_by_user/hgduiij/,1,r/SEKI,0,1
"Man, I feel that. I figure it's all Eastern Sierra for me autumn/winter/spring - which is a bit more difficult / brutal for snow and closed roads.

But, haha, I absolutely hated that trail. I went early winter and had to climb over a lot of down brush and trees, somehow there were still ticks even in freezing weather, I couldn't bring myself to make it to Redwood Canyon as the second bridge is out and the places was all snow and ice and it seemed impossible to cross when solo, had a heck of a time finding a good campsite (hammock - though, it's true higher up on the western HST, too), there wasn't much wildlife (not even birds), then I slipped on a rock crossing one of those creeks and busted my knee (why I was jumping rocks when it was raining, I cannot say - like, just step in the water, I'm already wet).

"The central coast is fantastic for hiking and outdoorsy shit. There aren’t any granite domes or Sequoia trees, but just up HWY 1 is Big Sur, where you’ll find some great coastal redwood groves. It’s also a spectacular drive. 

I actually just wrote out some good hikes in the San Luis Obispo/Paso area: 

Bishop’s peak is the most heavily trafficked, most iconic hike. It’s not “easy” but with a steady pace and like 3 hours you can do it, and it’s well worth it. Amazing views all the way from the city to the coast, nice little oak grove below. Use the Highland Trailhead, not the Foothill Trailhead. 

Architecture Graveyard is cool, nestled in the hills behind Cal Poly. It’s where the really big final projects for architecture students get built, and many of them are very otherworldly and/or abandoned. It’s a nice flat hike on a dirt road. 

Cerro San Luis/Madonna peak is okay, gives comparable views of the city, and there’s a weird huge cement flat up top. Dude who owned Madonna Inn tried to build a restaurant up there in the middle of the night before anyone noticed. They noticed. 

If you don’t mind a bit of a drive, Montaña De Oro is the state park in Los Osos. They planted a ton of eucalyptus trees in rows there to use for ship building before they realized euc wood is shit for ships. There is also a ton of small beaches and coves teeming with sea life. 

A very nice, VERY short hike is Terrace Hill. It’s a small park in the city that rises just above the town to give a great view of the city and the two iconic peaks in the background. Seriously it’s like 10 min max but the view is great. 

If you want a tough, tough hike with a way better view than Terrace Hill, you can do the Lizzie Trailhead. It’s super steep, lots of false peaks, and there’s a neat bell structure at the top.

"SNP has been doing prescribed burns since the 70's, I remember being excited to see them from the roadway. That started because of research done in the 60's indicating prescribed burns are a part of managing a forest once you remove the natural cycles.

There aren't any tourists back where the control burn I mentioned took place - just cows in the summertime.

Form over function as with so much of governmental activity.

Contrast the complete lack of drama for SCE managed forests up in the Shaver Lake area. The disastrous hard/hot burns were all USFS managed lands, while SCE, despite being a blight on humanity second only to PG&E, had almost zero damage and impact on the land they manage (responsibly, despite their lobbyists). 

I looked at lawsuits going back to 2007 in Colorado regarding safety harvesting of dead trees due to bark beetle infestation following drought conditions, and the mere threat of a lawsuit for thinning forests gives the USFS cover for do-nothing policies.

"The Paradise Fire that you refer to has two options to get to Kings Canyon - 1) across the General Highway and Lodgepole Road, which have had fuel reduction work done, or 2) across the Kaweah-Kings Divide, which is basically just granite. It would have to spot over it. Either present good strategic fuelbreaks, and given how late it is in the year, onshore flow/northerly winds that could carry it to KCNP are typically pretty weak. I don't see it very likely.

The Colony Fire, however, is a different story. IF it crosses the Generals Highway, the Giant Forest and Lodgepole are in deep trouble. Not super friendly terrain in the Jennie Lakes wilderness that it would have to cross to get to get to Kings Canyon. Lots of granite and sparse fuels.

I really appreciate the feedback. The trip is too last minute to try and overly plan.

My wife has asthma, we passed on going up the hill last Sunday because it was pretty bad, but she's not been in distress this summer(in contrast to last summer). I don't recollect we've gotten to 200 this year, so not THAT bad.

Go up and down on Highway 180, 198 is steeper and has a lot more turns and unless you're planning on walking up Moro Rock, going to Cedar Grove in Kings Canyon is a more dramatic drive for scenery. Don't pass on seeing the Giants, they are amazing!

* For RLL there are (I think) 5 permits a day reserved for walkups.
* Hikers who fail to pick up their permit and haven't made arrangements for late pickup

Two follow-up questions if you don’t mind:

1) I know you are able to reserve permits online starting at Copper Creek but then selecting the 2nd night for Woods/Bubbs, are you saying that the rangers might not allow this? My thinking was that worst case scenario, you hike to Copper Creek the first day, and then backtrack and go to Woods the 2nd night and continue with RLL. Also, I realize it’s not the legitimate way to get on the RLL, but do rangers check permits after the trailhead? Copper Creek starts from the same spot so it doesn’t seem difficult to just go to Woods anyways…

2) Does the line/waitlist open at 7am? I thought that existing reservations weren’t forfeited until 10am.

"Wilderness permits are only valid for the trailhead on the permit. If you pick up a permit for Copper Creek, you have to enter the wilderness on the Copper Creek trail and then your permit is only valid until you leave the wilderness again. So the only legitimate way to get to the RLL from Copper Creek is to take it 30 miles north to where it meets the JMT at Palisade Creek and then follow the JMT back down, or use some cross-country method to get over to Paradise Valley.

Road's End opens at 7am for permit issue. You might have good luck if you go then.  They start issuing permits at 1pm the day before, but you have a good chance if you get there by 7am day-of I'd think, particularly if you go mid-week.

Keep in mind there's no quota after September 19, and you can self-issue after that date.",t2_cirls,MatthiasW,0,1630335775.0,0,t1_haxppy0,haxppy0,True,entirelyunique,t3_pej4oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEKI/comments/pej4oo/rae_lakescopper_creek_permits/,Rae Lakes/Copper Creek Permits,/r/SEKI/comments/pej4oo/rae_lakescopper_creek_permits/haxppy0/,2,r/SEKI,0,2

"The Walker fire is burning to the south in the Golden Trout Wilderness area.  It's still going after a couple of weeks. The smoke from the fire will have an impact as the winds shift during the day and over the next few weeks.

"I am very afraid of heights too, especially while driving. I've driven to Sequoia a ton from 180, less from the other access points. I white knuckle the portion along the cliff coming out of squaw valley every time. It's not even bad, I'm just pretty afraid of heights. Why I spend all my free time hiking as high as I can get, I'll never know. 

I've only taken the entrance from 198 a few times as I don't live near there but I don't remember anything that was particularly scary. But I'm more committed to getting to the mountains than I am fearing heights. 

Mineral king road isn't that bad to me, but can get dicey when you have to pass by someone. It's not a nice 2 lane like the entrances from 180 or 198 to generals highway are. It's a rutted up old road that's not wide enough for two medium sized cars in many places. I usually cede the right of way just so I don't have to worry. However, I went up there at the end of July for a backpacking trip, when we came back 5 days later a big portion of the road had been repaved and was very nice. I know they got funding to redo that road this year so they have probably made a ton of progress by now and I'm sure it's much nicer than the old road.

Once you're into the forest there's nothing to worry about as the trees provide a feeling of security and there aren't really any major drop offs. I feel the overall driving experience in SEKI is fantastic.

I encourage you to go. I hate heights too but that's never made me consider not going or avoiding any routes. It's too worth it.

"Walkups are generally a crapshoot and it's even harder to tell right now with all the smoke. It's a very, very popular time of year to get up there on a very, very popular trail but they air quality is also pretty bad. I've seen posts on here and other subs of people considering dropping trips left and right. I personally wouldn't be confident at all to make that long of a drive, having it all ride on a walkup on a Friday morning in peak season. Not to mention you'd get there at 9 or 10 giving people a couple hours to grab walk ups.

Continue to call the ranger and see if you can get anyone. If you want you could call other ranger stations in the park and see if they happened to have any offhand knowledge. Some rangers I've met are pretty familiar with areas of the park other than where they're stationed.

Another option could be calling the REI in Fresno and potentially getting advice from whoever leads their backpacking classes. I've seen their groups specifically on the lakes trail. Chances are they can give you a feeling for your chances at a permit as they get permits as part of their job and know the area you're going to.

If you could wait about a month, the quota season ends at the end of September. All permits are self issued, there's just a 25 person and 2 night limit at each lake. The longer you wait into the season the more the cold drives people off.

"I second all these hike recommendations, but really the lakes trail is hard to beat for how short it is and I can't think of many alpine lakes that are more accessible than Emerald and Pear. It's pretty mundane until about 3.5 miles in, then it's spectacular from the watchtower onward no matter where you stop. It might put you closer to 8 miles round trip to go to heather lake, but it's worth it. Just past the watchtower, you walk on a cliff for about a mile that has a sheer 1k ft drop into Tokopah valley. You can easily spot the trail to Tokopah falls down in the valley. (I don't know if the falls are running, it's been two very dry years in a row and we're getting pretty late in the season.

"It will be very crowded.

My advice is to go as early as possible (like  start waking up at Sunrise).

The drive in to Kings Canyon is beautiful and I'd recommend the Mist Falls Trail. For Sequoia, I'd recommend going up to Moro Rock and going out to Tokopah Falls. These three trails are the most popular trails in the entire park but they are for a good reason. They're easy/moderate and have a good payout which means a ton of people (probably less in Kings Canyon, way more in Sequoia).

If you're able to up the difficulty, that's one of the few ways to reduce the number of people. It'd take a full day but the hike up to Heather Lake, Pear Lake along the Watchtower is one of the best (not just popular) trails, hands down.

"It may affect some views. If you decide to hike up to eagle view or something like that it will definitely put a haze in your pictures. Considering you have a kid, I'd maybe check out moro rock and hike that. You get a great view of the great western divide and middle fork valley all the way to the Central Valley - again smog will surely obstruct some of this but moro rock is close. Most of the really great views are at least a few miles hike.

The air quality won't matter for walking through the sequoias. The only thing I can think of is that you may miss out on seeing how red the trees truly are without direct sunlight but that's no big deal.

Just for your information, Lodgepole is the campground and contains the visitor center and gift shop. Down the road is Wolverton parking lot and it has trailheads that allow access to the high Sierra. A couple miles further is Giant Forest and the Giant Forest Museum. They're all connected by shuttle that runs every 7 minutes until 6pm I believe. Last I was up there, the shuttle was not going to Wolverton but was running between Giant Forest and Lodgepole.

"Oh! I didn't pay attention to your date. Disregard all the permit stuff. You just fill out a self issued permit and you're done! That's why I always go after the quota ends, usually in late fall. Hardly anyone up there and permits aren't an issue.

I've never rented from the parks as I own two cannisters. I'm assuming the permit ranger is the same who rents out the bear cans and when the quota season ends they leave, so if that spot isn't staffed they don't rent out cans. 

The bear lockers are there from way before they required cannisters. Simply put they are from a past time when places in the Sierra never got crowded. Bear lockers can easily fill up at popular spots and it leads to improper food storage. Further, on most trails you may camp at any suitable spot past a certain point (unlike the lakes trail which only wants camping at the lakes in established spots), so if the sun is going down and you need to just set up for the night, the bear cannister provides storage. 

Really it's to protect the animals. The marmots are absolutely relentless and WILL get any improperly stored food, and bears that learn humans are a food source have to be shot.

"There are a bunch of hikes that can start off a Sunset (Sequioa Lake, Ella Falls, Viola Falls, etc.) but we didn't have time to do any of these. I wish we would've done them. What we did do: 

* horseback riding from Grant Grove Stables - highly recommended. My kids loved it. 
* Moro Rock Trail - The road up to Moro Rock is closed on the weekends so we took the shuttle from the parking lot. Get there before 10:30 because the parking lot is full after that. They pack you in to the shuttle but I would recommend hiking from the parking lot instead. We hiked back from Moro Rock instead of the taking the shuttle, so I recommend that. There are a lot of little offshoots you can do and lots of things to see, away from the crowds. It's mostly flat, so fairly easy, but it's not a short hike. Moro Rock itself isn't to bad, but it's something like 200+ steps going up stairs. There's cell signal near the top if you're desperate for that. lol.
* Boyden Caverns. Crystal Cave was all booked up, so this was a good alternative. After the tour, we climbed down to the river and dipped our toes into the water.
* Road's End was closed when we were there so we couldn't go to Muir Rock but we did get to see some of the falls in the area.
* Big Stump Trail - super easy trail. It was the last hike we did on our way out of the park.
* If you're into foraging, there are wild gooseberries all over. They are wild so they're thorny but really delicious. 
* No showers at Sunset, but there are showers near the cabins. I'm not sure if they're public-public.
* There are great views at sunset, so make your way to the western edge of the campgrounds when the sun starts to set. Great views of the lights of Fresno (?) at night too.",t2_usrvz36,jiggiepop,0,1629386760.0,0,t1_h9jk3ga,h9jk3ga,False,ineed100answers,t3_p0ribi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEKI/comments/p0ribi/grant_grove_cabins_packing_and_running/,Grant Grove Cabins packing and running?,/r/SEKI/comments/p0ribi/grant_grove_cabins_packing_and_running/h9jk3ga/,1,r/SEKI,0,1
"Thanks for the super helpful reply. Just a quick follow-up.. I did find this online. We will be visiting in non-quota season? Seems like we can just roll up and get a self-issued permit?

Wilderness Permits During Non-Quota Season (9/19/2021-5/26/2022)  
Outside the quota season wilderness permits are free, self-issued, and are not limited to daily entry quotas. Non-quota season this year will be from September 19th, 2021 through May 26, 2022. Self-issue wilderness permits are available at the nearest permit-issuing station. Please fill out the permit legibly and completely. The information you provide on your self-issued permit may be helpful in a search and rescue incident.

Separately, does anyone have experience with the bear cannister rentals they offer.. says they may not be available during the non-quota season. Why would that be?

Also, why would they have these bear lockers if cannisters are required? Was this a recent development?

"1. So for permits, there's some rules. If you reserved one online you can pick it up the day before (I think after 1pm, don't quote that). Or you could try to get a walk up permit. I believe there are a certain number of walk up permits available per day, plus any cancellations. Your best bet for walkups is to get there very early. The lakes trail is a very popular trail. The permits are not from the visitor center, they're at giant forest museum. The ranger is set up a ways to the left of the museum entrance.
2. Pear Lake to Moose Lake is all entirely off trail, completely exposed, has a lot of elevation gain, and I'd only recommend it if you're experienced with off trail navigation and a very strong hiker. It's all moonscape so you have perfect vision but like it said it's entirely off trail route finding and scrambling over granite. You also have the ever-present risk of thunderstorms up there on all that exposed granite so reading the weather is a necessary skill too. I've never been to Moose but I've seen it from Elizabeth pass, and the route to it would use to connect with the saddle at Pear Lake. It's definitely doable, I plan to someday soon, but like I said, for someone who knows that they're doing off trail and knows the area.
3. I have not been to Emerald or Pear in almost a year but something tells me a locker at pear was broken. I think it only had one chain or one of the knobs to close it was broken or something like that. I don't know if they've fixed that. Sequoia NP requires bear canisters anyways.
4. See no.2
5. Again, super popular trail so the easier you get started the better. It's uphill and rather unremarkable until you get to the watchtower about 3.5 miles in. Be careful of thunderstorms between 2-6. No fires are ever allowed on this trail, and no fires are allowed in the park at all currently.  There are pit toilets at Emerald and Pear lake, which is amazing. Both lakes are incredible and cathedral-like. The strips of trail just after the watchtower and then between Emerald and Pear lake are particularly remarkable. Most of the tent pads at Pear lake have little soil to stake into. One last tip that everyone going to any alpine lake needs to hear - it's dead silent and you're basically in an enormous amphitheater. If your voice goes above a 4/10 everyone there will hear you clear as day.
6. Lodgepole would definitely be the closest. I hardly ever stay in campgrounds so I'm not really useful here. I live close to the park so it's not relevant to me to use them.
7. I'd explore giant forest and crescent meadow, then check out eagle view and the view of the great western divide, maybe hike up the HST as far as the view would go. I could and have spent entire days hiking around the Sequoias.

"I too was camping in Lodgepole about 3 weeks ago, the ranger spiel included that he could fit inside a bear box and still have room. And there are additional extra bear boxes close to most sites if you have overflow. You'd have to bring an entire fridge's worth of food IMO before you'd start to be encroaching on not having enough space to store your food and toiletries.

You're definitely safe to swim by the campsite, though you're more likely to be able to like...submerge yourself (maybe dunk your head under if you find a deep enough pool) and wade more than anything...the low water year has been particularly unkind to the river and Tokopah falls (it was a barely there trickle when we hiked out to it). There are lakes and faster moving rivers certainly in the park but the one right by the campsite is mellow to mildly underwhelming this year.

As others have noted...this is a BAD fire year and it's doubtful those restrictions will lift as we head into the MOST high risk season for wildfires. Sucks that you can't use even the fire rings unfortunately. We tended to just call it an early night and got up with the sun instead.

"Your reservation only covers your campground reservation. You still need to pay the park admission fee to enter the park which you’ll pay when you arrive or you may be able to purchase online in advance. I would do that if you can, it’ll save you time getting into the park. 

I can’t speak on the bear boxes in Lodgepole specifically but I was just in Yosemite and they fit a RTIC 45 without issue. I’m pretty sure the bear box is likely the same size as it is in Yosemite. 

For the fire ban, I would not anticipate that being lifted in the next 30 days. Fire season is in full swing in CA and they’re being very cautious there, likely due to the devastation from last summer. I would guess that won’t be lifted until there’s snow on the ground. You’ll likely need a camp stove powered by propane in order to cook. Coleman makes some cheap ones that work great. 

Last but not least, would also recommend giving the Ranger Station a call to confirm all these questions as well, they’ll give you the best answers to your questions and ensure you have everything you need to know.

I also saw some similar reviews to yours when I was researching it.

"Definitely do the giant forest loop trail - good for your lil one and you’ll get to see some amazing sequoias AND you’ll likely get to be the only ones on the trail for significant amounts of time. It’s pretty flat most of the time too. I think you might be able to get a stamp at the grant grove visitor center - I didn’t try to go in but, there were rangers set up out front to answer questions etc etc. I saw some little kids present some filled out coloring/activity books? to the ranger as if the ranger was checking everything over so they could give the kids something for completing it. In terms of Moro rock, I personally say skip it and go to eagle view instead. It’s not the same level of exposure but you won’t have to deal with any crowd and the view, in my opinion, was just as good. I felt like the destination was heightened bc it was 1 more of a hike (it’s a moderate trail versus Moro which is just like going to a theme park, so it’ll be more in line with your back country desire) and 2 I could actually take my time up there. I didn’t make it to tokopah falls - it had been in my original plan too - a ranger I spoke to said that it wasn’t totally worth it at this point in the year bc the fall is really small. I did go to mist falls though and loved it, I highly recommend if your toddler is gonna be strapped in and you feel comfortable doing some elevation with them on your back. For mist falls, I would recommend getting an early start as it gets hot and the first bit of the trail (basically a very flat walk to get to what actually feels like the beginning of the trail) doesn’t have any coverage. The rest of that trail is super covered though. I know I’m going on and on here, I apologize! Last recommendation - I did the hart trail and combined it with the sugar bowl/redwood canyon trail. I think doing that would be way too much for everyone but, I think you could definitely do one. I started with sugar bowl (so at the trailhead next to the parking lot, I went right instead of left) and again, completely alone the entire time until I got to where the trail connects to the hart trail. I felt like I was in a storybook for probably the first two, maybe three, miles of that trail. I think it’s a significant elevation gain most of that time too so maybe just going in as far as it’s comfortable and coming back out would make sense. After that, you’re going down for a while and there were a couple short sections where the plants were overgrown some and you gotta walk through them.  I was less enthused with the hart trail -  I didn’t even see/couldn’t find the two major draws of that trail! And neither did the other people I talked to on that trail!

"You can, there's just a lot of considerations - mainly weather. You should read up on summer thunderstorms in the Sierra.

Bears or cougars aren't going to be stopped by a tent so cowboy camping is no more or less safe. It's much more important to cook and store your food properly - away from camp and in a bear locker or cannister if you're backpacking.

"On my hike out of Granite basin I encountered a group camped a few miles down the trail. It was a beautiful area with lots of flat tent sites. They had planned on going into Simpson meadow but found no water at Dougherty creek.

Ate outside. If you get the main meal like burger or any sandwich, the side options include a cup of chili, it's really like 1.5 cup, it's a big portion and delicious. Add a single serving hot sauce packet they give you to make it spicy.

Kid menu offerings: Mac n cheese, grilled cheese, kids burger, turkey sandwich, fruit cup (5-8 dollar range)

Breakfast seems to offer a lot, but still basic stuff, none of this is like great eating. French toast, big breakfast (eggs, pancake, sausage, bacon home fries), breakfast burrito, omelette, oatmeal...

"I just finished the loop a few days ago. 
The trail from Dourhty creek basin down to Simpson meadow is a bit rough, but pack stock resupply runs  for the trail crew camped at the Simpson meadow footbridge have helped. Once at Simpson Meadow, there is obvious evidence of trail maintenance. Brush and small trees have been pruned back. 

I encountered the maintenance crew maybe 2 miles upstream from their camp. They were rebuilding a granite block creek crossing damaged by rockfall. One of the crew warned me of ""some brushy areas"" up ahead. 
In real terms, it meant many yards of pushing thru dense brush following the path of least resistance. Running shorts weren't the best clothing option.....

There were a handful of sections like that, making for slow going. I also recall one fairly substantial rockfall that required some athletic balancing skills to maneuver over.

"What I mean by ""transit route"" is that new NPS land usually gets a shitload of road development. There isn't a road corridor between Yosemite and SEKI directly, but with a national monument there probably will be. 

I'm not talking about trails. I have no problem with trails. There's metric assloads of trails in the national forest now.

>And it's not like Forest Service lands aren't overcrowded as well. Try to get a permit to hike the Whitney Trail or a reservation at any of the official Forest Service campgrounds in the Sierra. It's true that I don't know of any USFS areas with entrance fees, but plenty require parking permits (for instance almost anywhere in Southern California--in the Angeles, Cleveland, Los Padres, and San Bernadino NFs--requires an Adventure Pass.)

That's nice, I'm not talking about those forests I'm talking about this specific one. And yes, some places in the USNF that require fees I'm not arguing that but a 5 dollar parking pass or 20 dollar per year is different than a 20-40 dollar per trip entrance fee. 

Also, according to a federal court decision, the FS can only charge you to park if you use developed facilities like a campsite or bathroom. Just parking and using trailheads you do \*not\* have to pay.

>Uh, everything in this photo is National Park

I was referring to a specific type of park. Sure among the 462 parcels you can find ""undeveloped"" areas but a large portion of them have been modernized to be easily accessible to increase the tourism count, and I don't doubt that this national monument would undergo the same modernization. Right now there's a handful of roads, some of which are one lane, and a metric assload of dirt roads in this region and I'm reasonably certain, due to this land's location and proximity to two of the busiest parks in the nation, most of that would be developed.

My overall complaint is that this will create a barrier for locals to access the land and is not necessarily the only or even the best tool for conservation and feels more like a development project to ""assist"" Yosemite and SEKI than it does an end in itself.",t2_slkjx,Flatline2962,0,1628611627.0,0,t1_h8facvy,h8facvy,False,jakdak,t3_p1f1m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEKI/comments/p1f1m7/inside_the_political_battle_to_preserve_a/,Inside the political battle to preserve a sprawling national forest in California,/r/SEKI/comments/p1f1m7/inside_the_political_battle_to_preserve_a/h8facvy/,1,r/SEKI,0,1

"It's already overflow for SEKI and Yosemite. I'm not sure what you mean by ""transit corridor between the parks"" but the JMT and many other trails already traverse between the parks through National Forest land. It's easy to construct a relatively direct walking route between any two points in the Sierra Nevada. There are still plenty of areas in the SEKI (and Yosemite) back country where you can find wilderness and isolation, even in the height of summer with the front country teeming.

"That is a \*massive\* swath of land that I'm not entirely okay with that. Generally I'm fine with conservation, and could get behind a portion of the land being transferred into a national monument or even a wilderness designation, but from what I can see it looks like it'd kind of steam roll shaver lake, Dinkey Lake/Creeks, China Peak, etc...

That's basically most of the Sierras that the Central Valley can access, for free, right now, and they'd basically paywall most of the southern Sierras with this. That I'm \*not\* okay with because fuck paywalling. The Sierras shouldn't be just for upper middle class professionals willing to pay a 20+ dollar usage fee.

And we \*do\* have other options. You can redesignate national forest land to be less open to logging and still open to most of the recreational activities people enjoy without turning it into NPS land full of fees and concessionaires and development. NPS protection actually is kind of shitty when it comes to conservation anyway compared to things like wilderness designations because by charter they have to make the lands accessible to people and balance that against conservation (and usually the balance goes towards development for access, it's hard to find a national park that is ""rustic"" or ""undeveloped"" any more), so I don't buy the whole idea that this is \*purely\* conservation driven.

I don't want to turn that bit of land into another Yosemite or god forbid a transit corridor between the two parks. Yosemite is basically disneyland during the summer and SEKI isn't far behind any more and it breaks my heart but I take some solace in the idea that I can go way, way, WAY out into the boondocks and find some pristine land still in the USFS land.

"I cant tell you much in the way of literature of trail building. But I can tell you some of what I know about the oral history. Most of the trails you see today were built in the 30's by the Civilian Conservation Corps. They were old game trails, improved by the Native Americans, then used and improved again by sheep and cattle hearders, then used and improved again by the U.S. calvary, then used and improved yet again by commercial mule and horse packing operations for the use guiding pack trip into the wilderness. The height of the trail network building and improvment was then with the CCC, with the intention of improving trail for pack stock. As pack stock was the only way most people accessed the wilderness until the 80's. Most of the trail built by the CCC have been set as unmantained due to lack of funding since about the 80's. A few reroutes have happened to the CCC trails have happened since the 30's for various reasons.

The High Sierra Trail is an engineering feat as it is a trans Sierra route through the southern sierra with the least amount of elevation gain and loss possible. And is a perfectly graded trail as far as trail building standards go. 

Colby pass area has along history of livestock grazing and the pass was the only passable way between the roaring river area and the Kern-Kaweah, two prime forage areas. The ""shoot"" between Kern-Kaweah and Junction Meadow on the Kern is a more noteworthy section of trail in my mind. At one point, before trail improvement it was considered a one way trail for pack stock as the animals would have to be let down on ropes, making an upward passage near impossible.

The ""Spinx Trail"" from Bubbs Creek trail to Avalanche Pass, I believe was built later then the CCC era, and made use of the army corps of engineers for trail design. It is quite the engineering feat, and in my mind only rivaled by Forester Pass.

The JMT as you see today was constructed by the CCC in the 30 as well. The JMT prior the the reconstruction my the CCC followed a much different route. One that was far less direct but bypassed all of the passes that were impassable with pack stock prior to the 1930 reroute. Most notably Forester, Glenn, and Pinchot. The attitude of the day seaming to be ""Fuck it weve got the time, man power, and resources were putting the trail THERE!""
