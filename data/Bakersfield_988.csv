Just moved to Bakersfield 6 months ago from the central coast . Moved over here because of the mortgage prices . I got a 250k home with 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. That wouldve been 600k over there. We're a family of 3 so it's a decent size. The area we live in is not the nicest but it's very calm and I've never seen any robberies or crimes here in our neighborhood. Cars barely pass by here it's pretty enclosed. The real test would be the summer heat 😬 . Ppl don't die of it often so I don't see a problem.

"If you move here you will have to get used to the weather.   

The summer’s are awe inspiring with their intensity.  
Heat like you’ve never experienced.   
Around mid may it starts to get hot as all get out during the day.   
By mid June the over night tempts stop going below 80 and at that point it’s just hot. ALL. The. Time.  

Then in the Winter around Christmas, it gets freezing cold. But let me explain why the cold we get here is truly awful.  
People in other places can see their cold.  What I mean by that is in other places it snows, or rains more. So people can see why it’s cold, it makes sense and folks accept it.  That’s not the case here.  
It will regularly get below freezing here but never snow, and rarely rain. Because of the high pressure and low humidity, it’s a cold that you can’t see.
An invisible biting cold that sinks into your bones and through your walls. You look around and wonder what it so cold??   
That cold sticks around day after day, until it seems like you’ll never be warm again.  

Until mid February rolls around and winter is suddenly over and it’s spring and everything is beautiful and the sun is shining. The flowers bloom and you go for walks, sit at the park, and enjoy being outside. Then it’s mid may again and it’s time for another 6 months of summer.  

So to recap:   

Mid February to mid May = Spring, beautiful.   
Mid May to mid August = 🎇🔥🎇.  
Mid August to mid October = Regular Summer.   
Mid October to Mid December = Fall, beautiful.

"If you care about city development in the future you may want to consider the far south west. Around maybe Panama/stine - Panama/buena vista.   
The city is going to push that way towards LA.   
That’s the way it was always going to be because the end goal (think next 50 years) is for the city to push a lot closer to the base of the grapevine.   
The City doesn’t really have any interest in pushing closer to Fresno or Tehachapi.  
However, if trying to stay away from areas that may eventually become developed and more urbanized then yeah, the northwest or Far East would be great options.  
Just steer clear of central/east/oildale. These areas are old and only getting older.

Ignoring that: Yes, I read the article you linked and after consulting and verifying corroborating information from other news outlets, the info you shared is indeed correct (though I'd like to add that Elder still had inconsistencies in his financial disclosure forms as of 13 August 2021, as reported by the LA Times; I'll link that article at the end of this reply).

"Lake Isabella and kernville are known for their outdoor activities like boating, mountain biking, whitewater rafting, and hiking. If you're not an outdoorsy type, then I wouldn't recommend the area outside of a quick day trip.  However, kernville makes for a fun day trip. Shirley Meadows right by Alta sierra has the most accessible hiking in the area though there may be some snow up there that may make trail access difficult. There is also the Cannell and whiskey flat trails which are by town. I wouldn't recommend swimming in lake Isabella due to the water likely being cold.  You could visit the local hot springs in the area which include hobo and miracle hot springs off of the old Kern river road. The food scene in the area is quite good with Ewings, Kern River Brewery and the 178 cafe as personal favorites.

"It gets up to 105 - 113 and pretty much stays there throughout the day, the night time will actually be in the 80's to 90's. AC is an absolute essential, and tons of fans will help save electricity.

Wear very light layers, light colors, and I found a personal fan and a spray bottle with water do wonders if I have to be outside, definitely wear sunscreen, and plan ahead of you have pets that you're leaving if you go on vacation.

"“Some of us worked to purchase affordable housing” and “purchasing a house in a different city than where I work” are two different statements. Kern County is “affordable” because the area has less opportunity for its residents to have a higher earning salary. By taking a salary in a larger income generating area (LA) and buying in a lower economic area, you deprive home ownership from those who don’t have the means to do the same. 

But luckily you’re only going to live in that property for three years before turning it into a rental, so we that house is permanently unavailable for others!

Yeah, it definitely depends on the side of town though, right? If that dude were on the side of town I work in (southeast) he'd be pretty uncomfortable about his tattoo decisions.

And then a lot of people would be reacting like your mom on the side of town I live in (southwest).

And he probably shouldn't even go near the northeast end of town. He'd probably be corpsified pretty quick.

You should be saying move here and THEN go buy a home in LA with the $200k you just profited from selling here.

"Do not move here.
If you do, you will get stuck here.
The thing about Bakersfield (and really this applies to most of the valley) is that money works different here.
It may be cheaper but that will bite you in the ass should you ever choose to try and leave. 

Let’s say your house here is worth 300,000k and you make 60k a year.
If you sell it; after paying off what you owed (let’s say) you now have 200,000k.
Say you move to LA, and a home you want is 800,000. You apply the 200,000 to that home and now owe 600,000. You’ve also got the same job but in LA it pays a bit better, 80k.

Now let’s flip that picture. 
Someone from LA sells their home for 800,000 and comes here to work the same job for a bit less. But, they buy a home here for a fraction of what it would be in LA.

"The person above is right.

We're very cheap and really income tax isn't a big deal because Texas and Washington screw you in other ways like raising sales tax.


Positives:

We are pretty diverse. We have a large Punjabi and Sikh population as well as Indian, Basque, etc. Our Black population has decreased but we're still here. Its about 50% Hispanic as well so I'd say we're diverse. I'm a witch and we have witch shops here so we're somewhat religiously diverse.

The pay is pretty decent compared to other places (I'm a teacher and make good money) and the housing is okay.

You won't get fresher food because California (and especially us) has the best produce and dairy.


Medium:

The weather is okay. It gets really hot (95 to 115 during summer) and coldish (30s for a month or so) but its a dry heat and we have A/C lol.


Bad:

Air quality is very bad. We get all the smog and no rain.

There is ZERO walkability.

Its conservative but in certain areas and also kinda not really.

Very, very, very corrupt police force.

People are stuck in a small town mentality so you'll get people saying to stay in the West side (white people) and theres gangs or an area of town is bad but its really not.

"Never been to Tacoma, people bitch about Bako and they never leave, or they do and come back. 2 hours or less of driving will get you to almost any type of weather you like. It’s in the 100s during the summer that is what people complain about. It’s extremely conservative. It’s really not that expensive to live here. It’s not as bad as people say it is. I live in a 1600 (I think) sqft house with 2 roommates and we pay a total of $1600. You won’t find that everywhere but it’s definitely possible, my last house was similar 4 people $1600. Now with inflation and everything the way it is everything everywhere is up and I can only report my experiences. My buddy just bought a 2600 sqft house for 435k and that is with high inflation etc. I guarantee you it’s cheaper that Tacoma no matter the tax laws, esp since propert taxes aren’t that bad here.
