Again, you have absolutely no repercussions coming your way if you fuck up and transmit the disease to someone else. None. All I'm saying is, as an individual, pretty please, pretty please with sugar on top with extra sprinkles, do your part and be careful until this is behind us. It takes two to tango.

"Masks don't really matter because when you're in social situations with your friends, like at a pub, or restaurant you're not wearing one. So unless you lock everyone up in their house it's pointless. On top of that, most people wearing masks aren't even fitting them properly, they don't last all day, cloth face masks really aren't doing anything.

There's nothing we can do but just deal with it. We've tried masks, lock downs, vaccines, social distancing, for over 2 years and the only thing that really slows it is lock downs, but we can't lock down because people need to make a living. So covid has won for now, it's not going away anytime soon, and we are just going to need to brute force through it.

"Eastern euro is a major commercial production hub. They will not be shooting there this summer. I’m not saying they’ll all come to Toronto. I’m saying Toronto, Vancouver, Mexico City will have a ton more work because major productions will not shoot there. Mexico City is currently busier than it’s been in years. I work in this industry and am forewarning what will happen. Don’t really care if you believe me or not.

Edit: to add, yes, they very much will shift one day shoots to Toronto. Toronto is a major production hub that does 1 day shoots from all over the world. These happen weekly here. I’m not saying eastern euro ads will shoot in Toronto. I’m saying UK, American and western euro ads that would’ve shot in eastern euro will think twice and bring that work to Toronto, or Vancouver or elsewhere. Toronto is cheaper then Vancouver to shoot in.

Edit: to double add, Toronto bids for 1-many day commercial productions from all over the world ALL THE TIME. Eastern euro takes a large number of them because they can build huge sets for cheap. The war and uncertainty in Eastern Europe will take them out of the market. Also PLEASE NOTE, Ukraine specifically has done the most UK productions over the last couple years, they where the top shop, UK will need a new home and I can guarantee big brands will not be willing to take any risks by being near a war zone.

"$100,000 is really not that much anymore, particularly in Toronto but hol up before anyone comes at me for that… lemme explain before anyone thinks I’m a massive ungrateful ass hole.

I’m at the $65k mark and it’s $40k after deductions… mainly from federal tax and private pension.  The pension may help me in the long run if by when I retire the economy isn’t as bad as it is now which is a huge LOL.  It’ll probably get worse.  I realize how lucky I am atm because sooooooo many people have it worse and I’ve had worse in my life too.  I realize how horrible it is to live on minimum wage because I did it for years and that was back before the economy is what it is today with rents and food costs.

"It was on and off. I was able to go to restaurants here and there when case numbers were low.

I also understood that if I took too many risks and my body was not prepared, my ass would have been taken care of by the good people of the Ontario health system. Since they've been repeatedly calling for patience, and due to them being overwhelmed, I did my part and sacrificed my mental well being for a while. I didn't live my life as if those were pre-pandemic times, but I did not rot, obviously.

What I'm saying is... this shit we're in was not caused by some hypochondriacs, but because of covid. And the call to sit inside for a while was brought to us by our health system and our health experts.

I endured some troubling times as a kid in a different country than Canada, and it would be laughable if someone from that era were to just proclaim ""I'm done with this war, I'm going to do my own thing"". With covid, you could kinda do that, but that doesn't mean the danger wasn't still there.

>We don’t have personal accountability in Canada, the government just mandates shit that force people to abide by it.

If this was about smoking or consuming junk food, I would understand, but none of those are contagious.

Let me tell you this... I visited family during covid abroad when things loosened up, and one family friend decided it would be a wise idea to throw an 18th birthday party for his granddaughter, so he did. He invited my parents over. Live music, plenty to drink and eat, all the bells and whistles, and he made sure everybody knew it was him who was paying for it.

Two days later, he was awfully quiet about it. My dad calls him up, and there's the macho man on the other side of the horn quietly proclaiming ""my granddaugther caught covid, and I think I have it, so I'm self isolating"".

So, yeah, the big kahuna decided to live his life to the fullest, only to pussy out once he realized he made a mistake. My parents are elderly, and while I'm not, I did have to take a PCR test before returning to Canada. It was not fun waiting for the results.

"I was speaking to the misleading comment above re: “significantly reduces” because they’re overstating the effect masking has had.  Masks aren’t the reason hospitalization and death have been “significantly reduced”.  Compliance efforts result in better outcomes for sure.  The results also showed an overall impact on transmission(yay!) but it really skewed towards a specific population segment and was not universal (boo!). 

When we’re having mostly moral and ethical discussions about how or if or when or why we would wear masks for COVID, the benefits of them are, by the evidence in this study, not that much.  And that’s okay (for the most part), because we’re smashing it with vaccines (due to said compliance efforts). I’m not really sure why you’re taking umbrage with me when buddy was wildly overstating it.  If you’re after misinformation, it ain’t coming from me.

From the Stanford article:

“The researchers enrolled nearly 350,000 people from 600 villages in rural Bangladesh. Those living in villages randomly assigned to a series of interventions promoting the use of surgical masks were about 11% less likely than those living in control villages to develop COVID-19, which is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, during the eight-week study period. The protective effect increased to nearly 35% for people over 60 years old.”",t2_15njye,itsthe90sYo,1,1648265777.0,0,t1_i25iv0u,i25iv0u,False,DonSalaam,t3_tntsbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tntsbx/ontario_reports_uptick_in_total_number_of_people/,Ontario reports uptick in total number of people in hospital with COVID-19 for second straight day,/r/toronto/comments/tntsbx/ontario_reports_uptick_in_total_number_of_people/i25iv0u/,-1,r/toronto,0,-1

"Masks do work a little, but maybe not as much as you think.  In the only large scale randomly controlled study done to date, masking has been shown to provide some reduction in overall transmission, but not very much.  Well fitted surgical masks reduced transmission by 11% with most of the benefit for individuals over 50; negligible effect for those under 50.  Importantly, cloth masks had a statistically insignificant effect.  Compared to vaccines (95% reduction in transmission initially) masks really don’t help all that much.  The study below was also conducted before omicron which is much more transmissible, reducing the effectiveness of masks greatly.  I’m not saying don’t mask, but if you want to “follow the science” - the study below is the best we’ve got on the subject so far.

"> Parkdale is not an ideal location. It's far from the main transit lines, and not a high-traffic area. Parkdale is still being gentrified, but it doesn't have that high-volume traffic by people with disposable income that you get east of Dufferin. Hard to get by with more than dive bar or cheap restaurant in that area. You rely on people coming from other areas, and heading away from the subway lines.

South Parkdale has the 504 King, 501 Queen and 29 Dufferin running along or through it. The 504, 501 and 29 routes are all in the top 10 for surface route ridership with the 504 King actually having the highest ridership in the entire surface route system. If we also include North Parkdale that includes the 505 Dundas streetcar as well which is another high ridership surface route. The 47 Lansdowne is another route that cuts through Parkdale though it is lower ridership than the other 4 I mentioned. All of those routes also connect to the subway. The 29 Dufferin + 47 Lansdowne are just a 10-15 minute ride from either Dufferin or Lansdowne, 504 King + 501 Queen + 505 Dundas are all about 20-25 minutes from St Andrew + Osgoode + St Patrick Stations. If 10-15 minutes by bus from the subway is far, then everything not in Old Toronto might as well be the end of the world. Not to mention that driving into Parkdale is possible via Lakeshore Blvd, the Gardiner Expressway and Queensway as well, and that breadth of transit options and easy access to arterial roads in Lakeshore + Queensway & a highway in the Gardiner has made it a high traffic area for a long time now. Go walk down Queen West in Parkdale during a nice day in the spring, summer and fall and try to tell me it isn't a high-volume traffic area from people with disposable income.

Parkdale already has plenty of businesses targetted towards those with disposable income as West Queen West creeps further west (take a look at the difference between the Queen Strip from Gwynne to Dunn vs Dunn to Roncesvalles, east of Dufferin isn't east of Dufferin anymore) and there is more than just dive bars and cheap restaurants in the area that have existed for years now at this point.

2004 - Elected (by members) leader of PCPO. 

2004 (maybe 05?) - Elected as MPP in Dufferin Peel Wellington Grey I think it was called. 

2007 - Lost to Kathleen Wynne in Don Valley West

I mean yeah that sounds good. But look at all the different masks people wear with different levels of effectiveness. We have one person with a bandanna and then someone with a KN95. And we’ve been wearing masks for 2 years. We still have had many waves with then. I wear mine when I feel it’s needed but are we really going to spend the rest of our lives with masks?

*""We show that, beyond the first 30 d[ays] after infection, individuals with COVID-19 are at increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease spanning several categories, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure and thromboembolic disease. These risks and burdens were evident even among individuals who were not hospitalized during the acute phase of the infection and increased in a graded fashion according to the care setting during the acute phase (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care). Our results provide evidence that the risk and 1-year burden of cardiovascular disease in survivors of acute COVID-19 are substantial.""*

"> How many old people showed up at a restaurant with the original version of their vaccine info and were turned away because they didn't have the QR code? It's absurd.

probably few to none.  We all saw reports of how checking them went down to a cursory glance at best in most places after new years. 

>The primary reason I see for the vaxxed to want to keep out the unvaxxed is spite.

keep in mind the vax pass policy was all developed early in the Delta era, where infection from the vaccinated was much different than with today's Omicron.  The passport makes no sense now, but it had its arguments at the time it was initially discussed, but only a tiny minority would agree with you its spite.

edit:

>This sub loves to say ""please don't harass me because I'm wearing a mask""...what about all these people who work with the public who had to get into confrontations with people not wearing their masks... What about them? No one should be forced to put up with that.

of course thats just as unacceptable.  They're both harassment and shouldn't be happening.

"Not sure I understand exactly what you mean, but that is my understanding of the ethics of vegans as well, that it’s about killing an animal, period. Lots of Indigenous culture and spirituality centres around hunting for food, clothing, and ceremonial creations (feathers, turtle shells, etc.). To be clear there are hundreds of indigenous nations and were not all the same. For example there’s ppl in my own family who won’t hunt or eat bear. Most clan based nations won’t hunt/eat their clan’s namesake. But the point is that most of our nations’ traditions and spiritualities have some intertwining relationship with the killing and consumption of animals. It’s not just a take it or leave it thing. I made the point of saying it’s ethical but that’s only on a scale of modern meat and animal product harvesting which ranges from equally ethical to unbelievably cruel and unnecessary. For example, killing a Buffalo, eating its meat and using its hide for clothing and shelter is (in my view) more ethical than raising in terrible conditions and killing 200 mink for a single coat. Hunting a moose, one of which usually lasts my family a whole year, is more ethical than pumping cows living in a small pen full of hormones and brutally killing it while strung up on a conveyor belt.

I feel like I’m going slightly off track again. But my point is that I don’t think my culture excepts it from any discussion, that’s the point of a discussion, but I believe that unilaterally saying that killing animals or eating meat is morally wrong, is inherently saying that those who do those things are immoral. And I for one am a bit sensitive to _relative_ newcomers to this continent telling us what’s moral and what isn’t. There’s a whole sordid history of people pushing a different set of morals on us in the name of a particular god, but that’s definitely a different conversation. But it plays into my sensitivity on the matter of my relatives being branded immoral, savage, etc. Instead I was trying to emphasize the rather sizeable middle ground of what I would consider immoral/unethical practices that dominate the modern animal product market.",t2_qsu26,jumanjji,0,1648250956.0,0,t1_i24p3sz,i24p3sz,False,archive_spirit,t3_tnlaqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tnlaqt/vegandale_goes_bust_as_toronto_storefronts_close/,Vegandale goes bust as Toronto storefronts close permanently,/r/toronto/comments/tnlaqt/vegandale_goes_bust_as_toronto_storefronts_close/i24p3sz/,1,r/toronto,0,1

"Really sad look into the psyche of Toronto (or at least its Reddit users) in this thread. No one should bother anyone for wearing a mask, but it's clear that a big portion of the population isn't affording that same benefit of the doubt to those who choose not to wear masks where permitted—completely in line with the laws being observed here and across the vast majority of the Western world.

The saddest is those who choose to believe that they can escape exposure to COVID while living in a dense major city with constant exposure to international travel while expecting everyone else to conform their exact standards of risk tolerance, assuming they will be one of the people who will suffer the absolute worst side effects of the disease. COVID will come and go in waves everlong whether or not we have mask mandates, and I advise those who see it differently to check in on the observable reality across the world.

I will continue wearing a mask where it's required and not wearing one where it's not, completely in line with local regulations and my personal risk tolerance, without complaint.

"I got really sick at the end of last week, tested negative for Covid twice, but still figured I'd keep my germs to myself this week and leave my mask on as a courtesy to everyone else, while I still have a lingering cough.

Have noticed numerous eyerolls and smirks since then. Haven't gotten any comments but if I did - man I'd be tempted to drop the mask and start coughing all over those fools. It's amazing how much they claim to be all about personal choice, yet can't respect yours OP.

You have to remember though that anyone who tries to make you feel like shit generally does that b/c they are trying to bring everyone else down to their level. People who aren't actually scared are also usually secure enough that they don't feel the need to call random strangers' pussies.

The ones who do are likely the same ones who are actually terrified of covid, but the way they deal with it is by being in complete denial. 

So that's why they feel the need to call others out - because they hate anyone who acknowledges the reality and forces them to acknowledge it too. They want everyone to be in denial with them, and that's why they resent you for continuing to wear a mask when it doesn't affect their daily business in any way.",t2_dhs67ib,photo_voltaic,0,1648248756.0,0,t1_i24k990,i24k990,True,Markaayy,t3_tnehyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tnehyf/psa_please_mind_your_own_fucking_business_when/,PSA: Please mind your own fucking business when people continue to wear their masks in public,/r/toronto/comments/tnehyf/psa_please_mind_your_own_fucking_business_when/i24k990/,1,r/toronto,0,1

"Reread my comment and my reply.

Neither my post nor yours mentioned masks.  A vaxxed commented about their experience, and then an unvaxxed did the same.  My reply is completely relevant to the theory on long term effects if all are catching it at the same rates.  If true and it is ever proven, then yes preventing cases would be more important than simply trying to reduce symptoms.  Which I'd agree with.

Shows how disingenuous you're being if can only resort to that kind of retort.  If you join a conversation it's to relate the discussion to what was being discussed.  Not ignore what they were saying, twist it, and then cry about it.  Shows your agenda.

So what is your point in your initial reply?  You said, ""No one knows the long term implications of COVID"" to and unvaxxed that had similarly mild symptoms to a boosted person.  I replied that infection rates are similar for both, fact.  If you can't see the relevance, there's no reading comprehension that can help here.

"> As a former Parkdale resident, your narrative is simply incorrect. It was a great example of a disinformation campaign started by the misogynist clickbait outrage shills at Vice. I don’t know the people that owned those restaurants nor did I frequent them, but I completely understand how attending an event hosted by a misinformed lynchmob would have been unproductive for all.

As a former Parkdale resident you would know that the community meeting was hosted by Parkdale Community Land Trust and Greenest City, not some misinformed lynchmob. And the narrative isn't incorrect, that is what occurred. You are the one peddling misinformation and capping for ""Vegandale"". For a so-called former resident of Parkdale you sure got your whole series of events backwards and don't even know what Parkdale Community Land Trust or Greenest City are. Where in Parkdale you from, Parkdale Road over in Ronceys lol

> Also, there were a bunch of demands made of them (and not of a single other new/expensive area restaurant), that they agreed to do for the community, including local hiring. There were zero demands asked of other expensive restaurants or stores in the area.

Because Vegandale was a brand with the quite explicit goal of what is best described as co-opting and gentrification. A brand that started with 4 businesses and with a planned expansion to 8 as well as talks regarding going beyond 8. Remember when there was a real chance of Tibet Kitchen being forced out of its current location due to a Pizza Hut? Remember the demands made of Pizza Hut/Yum!Brand/the landlord which can be boiled down to ""fuck off""? You're talking outta your whole ass my guy. If Yum!Brand putting in one Pizza Hut got Parkdale heated, imagine 4 Yum!Brand businesses with a plan for a total of 8 along with rebranding and marketting as Yum!Dale while also purposefully making their marketing and branding rub people and the community the wrong way on top of refusing to actually come to a meeting about them which they were invited to and was organized by Parkdale Community Land Trust. Forget the shit Vegandale got, Yum!Dale would get twice that easy.

">Remember the days you could walk to school, and we gave a shit about kids education?

It's quite costly to build enough schools that every kid is within a few blocks, which seems to be the going standard for ""walk to school"". But that's sort of tangential to the point. I'm not making a value judgment about how many schools we should build and where, I'm arguing that if we want to maintain underutilized schools while opening new ones, we as the city and its taxpayers should pay for it. Levying charges on developers is not appropriate while we maintain significant numbers of underutilized schools.

And honestly development charges for funding new schools are pretty questionable as a whole, in my view. Expanding our city's common infrastructure is the responsibility of all taxpayers, not just builders and buyers of new housing. In fact, insofar as we are experiencing a housing crisis I think we should try to *avoid* raising revenues disproportionately from builders and buyers of new housing, which is the current model. Homeowners benefit from disproportionately low property taxes and appreciating land, refuse to fund new infrastructure sufficiently, and then act like it's the fault of developers.

"As a former Parkdale resident, your narrative is simply incorrect. It was a great example of a disinformation campaign started by the misogynist clickbait outrage shills at Vice. I don’t know the people that owned those restaurants nor did I frequent them, but I completely understand how attending an event hosted by a misinformed angry mob would have been unproductive for all.

Did I think their marketing was a good idea? Nope. But did it justify the disinformation and outrage? Also no.

Also, there were a bunch of demands made of them (and not of a single other new/expensive area restaurant), that they agreed to do for the community, including local hiring.

"It's not really too strict, especially in Toronto of all places! Most roti places I've asked don't even use ghee in their vegetarian options, so there are a lot of vegan options, and doubles are usually vegan (I make them 2x a week!). Garlic sauce on falafels is actually often vegan, it's like an oil vinegar dressing, plus there's hummus. Coconut or almond yogurt is great, I actually like it better than regular yogurt, especially in savory contexts (coconut yogurt in curry). And then in Chinese vegetarian cuisine, there's only a few dishes that have eggs (pretty much no dairy).

"I would wholeheartedly agree with almost all of this. And I would add that most ethical meat eaters are also aware of the same issues caused by factory farming. I personally believe that it doesn’t matter if you wanna eat only vegetables or raw beef, you’re completely out of touch with reality if you don’t understand and acknowledge the vast harm of factory meat farming, and certain methods of vegetable farming, including organic farming that prohibits the use of perfectly safe in-organically sourced plant nutrients in favour of “organic” ones that contain wayyyy too high phosphorus causing massive runoff into rivers and land (as one example) causing the cycle to start all over again. 

My issue with both sides can basically be summed up by you have to be some level of ignorant meat eater to not know how bad factory farming is (environmentally and ethically in the way animals are treated), and you have to be some level of ignorant vegan to call an all-vegan diet morally superior knowing that it immediately paints those of us whose cultures stem from (ethical) meat consumption as immoral. The true immorality is the entire way the whole food industry is set up and unfortunately there’s just no simple way to fix it. So hopefully those of who have the ability to do so can source food more ethically, say meat from hunting, or veggies from our backyards and trustworthy farmers even if it may cost a bit more. 

In conclusion, thank you for agreeing and acknowledging my main point about food sovereignty.

"Most ethical vegans who are educated on these issues would agree that veganism has to take into account the protection of indigenous land, and that veganism does not need to be adopted by everyone in the world. 

White veganism is more of an issue of racism and imperialism than of veganism, especially considering people of colour are far more likely to be vegan than white people. Just like the harmful effects of ""white feminism"" are not a result of feminism.

Meat requires far more land than vegetables. For example, over 70% of the soybeans grown globally are used for animal feed in the meat industry. If more people adopted plant based diets, less land would need to be used to feed us. Land activists in the global south are regularly killed for protesting the deforestation that takes place to support meat production. 

People who are allies to indigenous people should be adopting plant based diets, because it minimizes the amount of land we exploit in Canada and abroad (a lot of meat is imported). This does not apply to people who have sustainable ways of life.

"Considering loads of vegans in Canada try to push their beliefs on indigenous land where we’ve hunted for millennia, yeah I can see why people think vegans can be racist. I know most of y’all don’t roll w PETA but they decimated the entire economy of the Inuit up north over bold faced lies. There’s a history of vegan and animal rights based racism in this country. While most vegans today aren’t coming from that perspective, I think it’s still somewhat important to acknowledge the damage that has been done. Non indigenous populations factory farming meat and veggies (and diamonds, and oil) have displaced and poisoned so much of our natural roaming food. I’m straying from my point a bit, but veganism in Canada has had a historical role in anti-indigenous racism.

"This is simply not true.

"I think I was a meat eater the first time I went to Vegandale, and their signs bothered me. In retrospect, they were just working on me. But I’ve noticed that Odd Burger also took away all the vegan advocacy once they rebranded.  If you can win them over with good, affordable food, maybe that’s the way to do it.

I’ve found that subtlety works a lot better than the sledgehammer approach, but I personally had to be sledgehammered to go from vegetarian to vegan.  I needed the push to get off cheese, and I’m glad I got it.

But the assholes will be assholes (and there are plenty in this thread).  They will be overjoyed that a preachy vegan place is gone while they harass vegans for not eating meat every time they meet one.

"There are two deeply funny things about this comment.

The first is the accusation that it's ME that's being political, when you're running around spamming this thread like the batsignal went off at John Tory headquarters.

The second is that you've spent 1000 words explaining...exactly how my comment is, in fact, accurate.

The dirty secret about Smart Track in its current iteration is that we're taking a bunch of things the province was doing anyway, slapping the Smart Track sticker on them, but letting the City of Toronto pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege to let John Tory save face, when the province would have been paying for all of it otherwise.",t2_61skf,McKingford,0,1648240985.0,0,t1_i2429ta,i2429ta,False,hadye_71,t3_tni7ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tni7ng/toronto_mayor_john_tory_to_run_for_a_third_term/,Toronto Mayor John Tory to run for a third term,/r/toronto/comments/tni7ng/toronto_mayor_john_tory_to_run_for_a_third_term/i2429ta/,5,r/toronto,0,5

"Good riddance. Doomie's was easily the worst vegan restaurant in Toronto.

Not that my diet is stellar and I don't enjoy junk food, but there was nothing really satisfying about it--just felt like eating grease. I'm vegan, but, seriously, some things (like the worst of the worst of American fast food) just don't need a vegan version. There was also the gentrification aspect and the weird and questionable politics of the owners (they seemed to be really in bed with Gary Francione, who is a narcissistic kind of cult leader-like figure in certain parts of the animal rights circle--for the record, among other things, Gary Francione believes that being vegetarian/vegan and liking vegan burgers and sausages is morally the same as being a pedophile and using child sex dolls instead of abusing kids. A common saying among people who've been in the movement for many years is that you haven't been in animal rights long enough if he hasn't tried to sue you yet).

"I agree that this is an issue. IANAL. 
The reason I would recommend pepper spray and self defense courses over a box cutter or knife is that it's easy for an attacker to take the knife and use it against you which is very dangerous. It's also true that pepper spray has risks. The wind could blow the wrong way at the wrong moment. It can also be taken and used against you. We each have to find our own path.

My main problem is that government likes to discourage self defense.

>and if they get it wrong it is a much heavier charge

Even if they get it right, they can be charged as even the police don't always understand the law; when in doubt they tend to lay charges and let the courts sort it out. 

It's my position that there are definitely cases we have seen in which the victim is very obviously defending themselves and the police see fit to lay charges anyway; these are situations in which the justice system further punishes and victimizes the victim, for self defense. 

Very few Canadians would want to see Canada become Americanized, open carry, closed carry, the sort of cowboy mentality where it's every man for himself and that problems can be solved by force; this is not where I'm coming from. I think that Canada as a society has gone a little too far in the opposite direction, to the point where a significant portion of the population actually believes that we do not have a right to self defense. I believe that this is morally wrong; it allows an environment in which we as a society accept it when the legal system further victimizes victims. This is the opposite of justice; it's injustice; we have not created a justice system we have in part created a system of injustice.

When I engage people in the way I engaged you in discussion, I'm trying to raise awareness and encourage Canadians to study these issues so they understand them in more detail: it is true that historically, defending yourself put you at legal risk. This situation is changing, legally. Study the ""Lucky Moose Bill"". 

It was not my intend to give advice; but I did and you are correct to note that. It is my intent to raise the issue and to advocate for increased awareness of self defense. 

If you feel that you are at risk of physical violence, that is a problem. Nobody should be living in fear. There are steps that you can take. You can take classes in self defense. You can learn about what every day items can be used in self defense. We must each work out the details for ourselves and find our own path forward.

You have a right to feel safe walking down the street. You should be aware that there are people who may try to take advantage or use intimidation or force against you. You should be prepared for this eventuality and try to have a plan. Having tools and a plan should help you to reclaim your confidence, at least in a small way. 

If someone gets inside your personal space and you feel unsafe, you should be able to say: ""You're in my space; please give me some more elbow room."" You should not ignore it; nor should you needlessly seek out confrontation or escalation.

I hope that you're able to find a way to feel comfortable in your own neighbourhood, which is an extension of your home.

"here's a fun fact about urban density: North Riverdale has actually decreased in density since 1976

Take a look at [this plot](http://www.erikdrysdale.com/figures/gg_tor_preamalg_neighbourhoods.png) and note all the neighbourhoods that have actually decreased in density during that time period. Most of them are in the old Toronto area which actually has decent transit service.

We absolutely need to be able to increase the density of these neighbourhoods. I don't think we should be building tons of skyscrapers there, but we should at least be able to build a triplex in the place of a SFH.

"So some of what you are saying is incorrect, and thats fine ill correct it. Some is right. I get that you are politically motivated and want to attack Tory, thats fine too, I don't think he's the best politician in the world by any means.

Smarttrack was conceived as an adaptation of the existing GO network. So, 9 of those 22 stations were already existing GO stations. So that admittedly leaves 13 new stations. One could argue it was disengenuous to ever call those part of the Smattrack plan, but it is what it is.

Any good planner will see an error in their plan and adapt accordingly. GO already was looking into electrification of their network, known as GO-RER. Some of the plans and stations overlapped, some (the 5 stations we have now for Smarttrack) did not. Ontop of that, some of the plans were redundant. It was advised to Tory and his transit planners that it would not be a good idea to run Smattrack as a heavy rail corridor over the Eglinton West area, but instead use the original Eglinton West extension of the LRT that was cancelled by Dalton McGuinty in 2010. The city were to pay for this, but Douggie Ford got elected as Premier and swept in and demanded it to be tunnelled rather than at grade, and would foot the bill. So Tory got lucky there.

Ford also demanded that the entire Scarborough subway be built, with a station at Lawrence. The ridership to justify a Lawrence subway stop was already abysmally low, and so it was determined that to boost ridership to the Scarb subway, a bloated, unnecessary project, stations at Ellesemere and Lawrence on the Smarttrack system were removed. You really can't blame Tory for that.

The same happened to the Gerrard station because of the Ontario Line. Ironically at the same time, both the planned Downtown Relief Line and the Ontario Line praise and make good use of the Smarttrack Unilever station, and the politicians of those projects always write it in a way like they were the ones who planned this GO station for the purpose of their lines. Again, political posturing will posture.

Smarttrack was also determined to be better as being incorporated into the GO-RER plan (now called GO Expansion) rather than 2 separate services. The service levels will indeed be affected as you mentioned, but not to the severity as you state. The Smarttrack stations will see trains every 15 minutes during rushour, but only every 30 minutes off peak. Some of this is oddly unnecessary though. For example: Liberty Village Smarttrack station could indeed be serviced by more trains, but only the Kitchener Line is stopping at it, even though the Barrie Line could as well. This would increase the service levels to every 7 minutes during rush hour and every 15 minutes at off peak. That is a GO/Metrolinx decision though and i'm perplexed as to why they would do this.

Finally, there was an attempt at fare integration, but Doug Ford reversed it. From 2017-2019, TTC riders could get half price rides on the TTC if they rode GO. For some reason this was nixed by the province, and instead people riding in the suburbs on Mississauga, Brampton, Barrie etc transit get free rides if they ride the GO. Better fare integration is coming to GO, but its a Metrolinx decision. You can read the report here [https://www.metrolinx.com/en/regionalplanning/fareintegration/default.aspx#:\~:text=Metrolinx%20and%20our%20transit%20partners,systems%20simple%20and%20hassle%2Dfree](https://www.metrolinx.com/en/regionalplanning/fareintegration/default.aspx#:~:text=Metrolinx%20and%20our%20transit%20partners,systems%20simple%20and%20hassle%2Dfree).

Most likely what will happen is both the TTC and GO will turn into a fare zone system, where you pay the same amount of money to ride GO or TTC, as long as you stay in that fare zone.

So Smarttrack definitely is not what Tory presented at the time, but it is actually better. We get 5 new stations right downtown that will have great service levels of 15 minutes in rush hour, and will most likely have full fare integration with the TTC, but that is still being worked out with Metrolinx. We are much better off with what we are getting on Eglinton, and its much better that GO and Metrolinx are running the Smarrtrack stations. As well, the feds are paying for 50% of the bill of building the stations, which was not part of the inital proposal by Tory.

I do agree that fare integration and better service levels are necessary for these stations to flourish. Both are in the hands of Metrolinx now, so we will have to petition and convince them to do both. Both are possible with what is being built, they just need to change what trains service these stations and change the fare structure of GO/TTC.",t2_7licy,beartheminus,0,1648236316.0,0,t1_i23qs7y,i23qs7y,False,hadye_71,t3_tni7ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tni7ng/toronto_mayor_john_tory_to_run_for_a_third_term/,Toronto Mayor John Tory to run for a third term,/r/toronto/comments/tni7ng/toronto_mayor_john_tory_to_run_for_a_third_term/i23qs7y/,4,r/toronto,1,4

"I hope this person rests in peace.

This tragedy was preventable.

The city still refuses to provide survival supplies for cold weather and regularly confiscates fire safety equipment. They do this on purpose because encampment fires helps their public relations campaign in rationalizing the clearing of encampments. They don't care that people continue to die as a result of their cruel enforcement.

**[Op-ed: Toronto is playing with fire on park encampments](https://nowtoronto.com/news/op-ed-toronto-playing-with-fire-on-park-encampments)**

> We’ve watched Toronto firefighters pull up to parks in response to phone calls from area residents and extinguish fires that encampment residents were using to cook or stay warm during the pandemic. **We’ve also watched firefighters confiscate propane tanks and fire extinguishers** saying encampment residents cannot be trusted with them.

> Firefighters say it’s against City by-laws and that folks should avail themselves of the shelter system as a safer option to living outside. **But what are encampment residents to do when they’ve been turned away because the shelter system is full?**

> The City’s zero-tolerance approach to fires in encampments has led to more hidden and unsafe practices by unhoused people. It’s also led to freezing deaths. At least three unhoused people have died because of the cold weather in Toronto so far this winter.

[...]

> There have been other deaths of unhoused people attributed to encampment fires in Toronto. Grant “Gunner” Faulkner died in 2015 while trying to keep warm on a night when the temperature dipped to at or below -15 ℃.

> Grant’s death led to a Coroner’s Inquest and 35 recommendations from a jury. While different levels of government have taken partial actions on the recommendations, they have never been fully implemented. **These include calling on the City of Toronto to change its policies to provide ‘survival supplies’ and fire safety information to unhoused people. Examples of survival supplies include fire retardant blankets and safe heat sources.**

[...]

> We can all agree that living outside, especially during winter, is not ideal. Yet unhoused people often have no choice with a shelter system that’s in crisis.

> The City has declined to provide the number of people turned away from the shelter system. **There were on average some 38 people turned away from shelters in Toronto each day last year.** The Shelter, Housing and Justice Network (SHJN) claims the number could be higher.

[...]

> Meanwhile, other cities have been taking action with preventative fire safety measures. **Vancouver hands out fire extinguishers, sand, and fire retardant blankets to encampment residents. In Winnipeg, barrels are provided for safer controlled fires.** Both cities have similar bylaws to Toronto, yet these cities’ efforts show a willingness to move beyond the red tape and prioritize harm reduction measures that help save lives.",t2_4rzxj,mr_nonsense,1,1648236205.0,0,t1_i23qiii,i23qiii,True,IvoryHKStud,t3_tnbzcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tnbzcj/one_person_dead_after_encampment_fire_near_dvp/,One person dead after encampment fire near DVP,/r/toronto/comments/tnbzcj/one_person_dead_after_encampment_fire_near_dvp/i23qiii/,-3,r/toronto,0,-3

My point being I grew up comfortable and even have a better career than my parents but my purchasing power is still less. That is the reality.

"Oh yeah, sorry, i hate how my strokes always prevent me from reading deleted comments. So annoying. Anyway.

Most tradespeople working out of a hatchback are not effective or efficient. Like how many times do you want to drive back and forth picking up tools and materials because you refuse to buy a pick up truck or van that is capable of doing it all on one trip.

The claim is not nonsense. Construction trades use big trucks for a reason. I mean, you can dig a swimming pool in your yard with only a shovel if you wanted or you can be smart and rent a backhoe from home depot and save your back.
