"I recommend a zero tolerance policy on toxic behavior. A game store should be family friendly. It’s hard because kicking out a toxic customer is still kicking out a customer. But excessive swearing, cheating, elitism, sexism, etc isn’t good for an atmosphere. The reason I know the trash will come is because I was close to Gamer’s Hollow and Bad Wolf when they were running here.

And I get it. Game stores are one of the few public places that the most socially inept like myself tend to feel at home. So be patient with them, just don’t give any slack. Three strikes you’re out, try again tomorrow. We can all learn to be less trashy. If you can balance that, I think you can make it work. Because at the end of the day, a game shop only works if it is a healthy community.

"I think you could pull it off with the right mix of good luck and business sense. I won't pretend to know why GH didn't make it, but I think there are a few easy-to-spot ways to improve your chances. 

They hung in pretty well considering the circumstances, but if they had kept better hours, or stocked more goods, maybe they could have kept it going. There were times I wanted to shop but had to wait a day, or till evening to shop, and then they may not even have what I went in for. Makes it really hard to compete with scamazon, which is always open and has infinite stock.

Also, some of their regulars were a bit rough around the edges, which meant I couldn't bring my kids. One time I introduced my kid to the guy behind the counter as a way to remind him that he was speaking in front of a child, and he made really distasteful child abuse jokes. And while most of the usual crowd were really nice, other times it felt a little closed off to newcomers because of the tone of the general table chatter.

The owners themselves seemed awesome though! The mom wanted to start having tables for kid D&D sessions, which I think would have been a huge boon, but I'm not sure if she ever landed DMs to run the games. I think if you really want to make it, you have to mainstream the hell out of it. Magic is a hell of a game and it's gotta be great for the bottom line, but it seems hard to pivot out of. Make sure you diversify.

I believe they were also dealing with a lot outside of the business- **not to mention Covid**- and I'm pretty sure they had another business or businesses they were running. If you're thinking about starting another game shop, I'd track them down and pick their brains.",t2_5k9o1,maxbastard,0,1645680769.0,0,t1_hy7csjh,hy7csjh,True,Qavirra,t3_szr52f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nacogdoches/comments/szr52f/new_game_store/,New Game Store??,/r/Nacogdoches/comments/szr52f/new_game_store/hy7csjh/,7,r/Nacogdoches,0,7

"Go to The Bosslight Bookstore at 123 E Main Street. Talk with Tim Bryant, the owner. Tim is an author first and bookstore owner second. He’s also good friends with Joe R. Lansdale, who I believe is our town's most prolific author. Pre-Covid the Bosslight also had regular book signings, so I can’t think of anyone who would know more about the local writing scene than Tim. 

I’d also suggest joining the Facebook group “Nacogdoches Talk.” While it has all the problems associated with a Facebook group, it has a more extensive and diverse local membership than r/Nacogdoches.

"If you're still looking for a place to rent, I'd suggest just kinda driving around Nac. I normally do that while I'm getting my kids to sleep a bit when they've fallen asleep in the car. There are some houses that pop up from time to on Raguet street, there's usually a couple houses on the street that Flashbacks is on as well, but that really close to SFA so they'd be priced more for college students (most rentals are priced for college students here honestly). 

Rental agencies that are trustworthy? I'd go with [Principle Properties] (https://prnac.com/), [Mario Wesley] (https://mwesleyrealty.managebuilding.com/Resident/public/home), or [Barham Properties] (https://www.barhamproperties.com/index.php?action=searchresults&sortby[]=status&sortby[]=price&sorttype[]=ASC&sorttype[]=DESC&pclass[]=5).  Principal Realty doesn't seem to have a lot open atm, Mario Wesley has a few but not all are what I'd call ""great choices"" but you might want to call as they sometimes have things open just not listed.

"You're going to reach a point where the speeds become hardware dependent so older hardware won't be able to to full advantage of higher throughput speeds.  For example, different types of WiFi protocols have different throughput speeds. With the 400Mbps number you through out my first guess would be you're using multistream 802.11n or 802.11ac because they max out at 400 & 433 Mbps respectively.   If you are wireless a quick check to this would be to connect your computer to your router/switch directly and checking speeds again (assuming you have a device with a network card.) There are also other factors with wireless such as distance and interference that can affect throughput.   


There are also hardware that will affect this, like an old 5400 rpm harddrive maxes out around 800 Mbps but that's well beyond what you're getting so I'd focus on the wifi first.",t2_47n0y,rlanthony,0,1637329373.0,0,t1_hl94tug,hl94tug,True,DesignerTex,t3_qx7b6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nacogdoches/comments/qx7b6x/suddenlink_1_gig_connection/,Suddenlink 1 Gig connection??,/r/Nacogdoches/comments/qx7b6x/suddenlink_1_gig_connection/hl94tug/,1,r/Nacogdoches,0,1

"Lufkin is actually going to be worse crime wise than Nacogdoches. A quick search for Lufkin Crime will net you the following information. 

""Lufkin has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes - from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 20.""

You should understand that you're moving in to a shark tank. With the appropriate amount of money you can elevate yourself away from the normal day to day of Nacogdoches but you should be prepared to do whatever is necessary to keep your children away from the shit show which is Nacogdoches. I also recommend that you look at neighborhoods from 10 years ago vs. today. This will give you a good idea on how fast poverty and crime is spreading.  I'll give you a few examples. 

Pearl St. in Nacogdoches approx 10-15 years ago was a semi-desirable place to live if you were lower middle class. These were a bunch of clean, well kept modest homes spanning the entire length of Pearl St. Today Pearl St. is easily one of the most burglarized areas in Nacogdoches. There are all sorts of apartments and houses in this area that cater to low/no income households. This means that Pearl St. is constantly being traveled by drug addicts, criminals and the unfortunate souls that own property there.    The West Side of Nacogdoches is low/no income. The East Side of Nac is low/no income.  The South Side of Nac is low/no income.  All of these areas meet at Pearl St. and Main (The police station).  Going North on Pearl is the spine of Nacogdoches and it's all garbage.   The East side of North St. is decent middle class but that's being encroached on as the poverty and crime spreads North.  

Without getting too wordy here is what you want to do.  Kenbrook, Waterford, North Fork or Appleby are where you want to live if you have to be in Nacogdoches. Unfortunately all of these areas are Nacogdoches School District.  If you move to Central Heights then you can have your children in their school district which is absolutely amazing.  There are many people that are selling their homes and moving 1-2 miles away to get their kids in Central Heights. 

I've lived is Southern California, Houston, Denver and other areas while being extremely poor. I only say that to emphasize that I know first hand what despair, crime and poverty look like. The things that I've noticed which separates Nac from the bigger cities is that in the bigger cities people still have hope to get out.",t2_yqgy8,OGUgly,0,1630596238.0,0,t1_hbbqxu5,hbbqxu5,False,beergenius,t3_pfwf0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nacogdoches/comments/pfwf0d/moving_to_nac/,Moving to Nac,/r/Nacogdoches/comments/pfwf0d/moving_to_nac/hbbqxu5/,3,r/Nacogdoches,0,3

Lufkin has a suburban feel. Lots of chain restaurants and strip malls. If that’s you’re thing, Lufkin may be for you. Nac feels more rural than Lufkin, but it’s also a whole lot less red.

The fireflies may makeup for the clouds of other insects that you mentioned, although wood roaches and fire ants are out of my realm of experience.

I didn't know that opossums ate ticks! My mom had a baby opossum as a pet when she was a kid. My grandpa flipped his lid when he found out about it and made her release it.

"Alligators: some lakes have alligators, but you won't just see them walking down the street or anything, most lakes that have alligators have signs. Lake Nac does not have alligators, but the lake at the zoo in Lufkin does and thus has warning signs.

Snakes: we have them in plenty, but the vast majority are harmless. We do have our fair share of copperheads and water moccasins though, and I did see a coral snake once, so I would avoid walking trails or overgrown areas unprotected, reaching into places you can't see, and swimming in unknown bodies of water.

Insects: lots and lots, it's warm and humid here and the bugs *love it*. I fully hate the wood roaches. Fire ants suck. Fireflies in late spring/early summer are lovely! We have every kind of beetle known to mankind, and in general I like them. The cicadas will attempt to deafen you in summer. The mosquitos are fierce and do not come in peace.

Spiders: we have black widows, but they hide when they see you so they're only a problem in wood piles and old sheds etc. so look before you reach. Some brown recluses too, but they aren't overly common in my experience. 

Wild hogs: remember the 30-50 feral hogs guy? He wasn't exactly making that up, though he was being dramatic. They are large and mean. These guys are genuinely dangerous, though they are rare to nonexistent in town, so you probably won't see them unless you live on a bit of land. You may see portions of the gardens or trails rooted up, likely that is hogs.  Look up Helibacon for a bit of fun.

Other: I once was held hostage in my car by a herd of racoons (ok I'm being dramatic but there were like 6 running around my car for a minute). The opossums can be truly giant, but they eat ticks and are the good guys. The squirrels are big enough to carry away your firstborn child.

"So, I'm a white person with some black and mixed family. Obviously I don't have the same insight as you, but I've been learning a lot in the last few years (and still have a lot to learn). 

As far as I can tell, I *think* the racism in Nac isn't too intense, my guess is having SFA helps, but that's just a guess. Most of the time, things will be fine, with the occasional side eyes in stores etc. But once in a while, there are more visible examples, such as a drunken outburst at IHOP last week with people yelling slurs at staff for enforcing masks. (Few people care about masks out here BTW, unfortunately.) r/SFA has a post with the IHOP video, but it's mostly just sad and discouraging to watch.

It's a mix really, lots of old white money, lots of rural people with confederate flags and Trump trains. But we also had lots of positive BLM protests last year, and a general good natured attitude of hospitality, and a pretty diverse mix of white, black, and hispanic people. Few people of Asian descent however. In general I don't think it's dangerous in most places in town, but I could be wrong about that since I don't personally experience it. 

I didn't attend the schools here, but people do have positive experiences with them, so it's not the worst. My guess is, if you're involved with your child they will likely be fine. The elementary schools are a bit hit or miss I think, but a few years ago we passed a bond to build a new building for one (Carpenter Elem), and update others, so hopefully that has helped. Class is in person right now, with masks. 

There aren't many private options, but SFA has an elementary charter school that is great, so look into that! There are a few churches that have elementary schools, Fredonia is the main one I know of, and Regent's Academy is a private school that goes through high school, but it's a learn Latin kind of private school so it's not everyone's cup of tea. In the north side of Nac is the Central Heights school district which is supposed to be better academically, but from what I've heard it's also the worst kind of rich white school so maybe not the best choice. There's lots of little districts just outside of Nac (Woden, Garrison, and some others), but I don't know if they're good bad or ugly. 

Hopefully other people will see this and correct any mistakes and share their experiences/knowledge. I have really enjoyed living here, there are a lot of good things as people have mentioned!

"Something no one has mentioned yet are the gardens and trails. If you enjoy walking/biking, there are a lot of great options! The Lanana Creek trail is several miles long, and one of my favorites. It does feel like an actual jungle if it's rained much, in terms of mud and mosquitos. SFA has several excellent gardens, they're gorgeous year round, and one has ""mountain"" biking trails (or as close as you'll find this far away from mountains, lol).

Pecan Park has a great disc golf course, there's tournaments every so often. There's also disc golf at Pioneer Park, Lake Nacogdoches, and a half course at Banita Creek Park. We also have 5 and 10k runs/walks every so often, either as fundraisers or through SFA

ZipNac is also fun, a zip line course just outside of town. Lufkin has a small zoo that's decent for what it is, and there are nice movie theaters there. SFA has a good lineup of performing arts events, once covid is over, sometimes including things like the Russian ballet or Vienna boys choir. They're building a fancy new performing arts building too. The Nacogdoches photography club is fun if you're into photography, though most members are older I know at least one younger person who enjoys it a lot! There's a watercolor club too, but I've never looked into it, I think it's also older membership. 

I love how you don't have to drive more than 10-15min to get anywhere. Shopping options can be frustrating, there's nowhere to buy good cookware or clothes for example.

"**Hello.**

I noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

"Let me tell you as someone who is not from Nac, but visited every weekend for 2 years and lived there for a year. It's great. There is not much in town, per se, but it is a great central location for other things. Like 3hrs to Dallas. Maybe 2 to Shreveport. 2 or so to Houston.

Grocery wise, there's plenty to pick from. 2 wally worlds, 2 Krogers, a Brookshires, and countless Dollar stores.

For fast food, they're pretty much all there. Restaurants, there aren't as many, but a few worth mentioning are Maklemore's, Barkeeps, Bottlecap Alley, Auntie Pasta's, El Ranchero. Chili's and whataburger are dogshit. Don't go. I love both chains, but Nac's are just fucking awful. I used to go at least once a week in my hometown, but when I lived there for a year, I only ate there twice.

Java Jacks is dope. Fuck Dunkin. You could order the same drink every morning, and every morning you will get a different drink haha

The housing is okay, although about half of it is owned by Mercantile and they are an absolute cancer. If you're gonna rent, make sure it isn't Mercantile. I would buy if able to. The Appleby area is pretty nice. Out of town, but not too far.

There is a mini golf course, but I've never seen it open. The bowling alley is fucking disgusting, don't go. The movie theater is decent. If you're into craft beer, The Fredonia Brewery is awesome. The Cottage is a nice little hole in the wall winery to relax as well. The Front Porch Distillery on the south end headed to Lufkin is great too. There's as least 3 pot dealers in every apartment complex, so drugs are cheap and easy to come by.

The worst part of Nac is the cops. They're dirty and corrupt. You definitely have to watch out for them more than criminals. If something happens to you, don't expect the cops to do anything. Caught someone on camera clear as day (and their license plate) of them returning to my condo after pouring sugar in my gas tank, and they did nothing.

"Being a college town, it's mostly busy during the Fall and Spring, while being more calm during the Summer and December. There are a few festivities, the the Blueberry Festival during the Summer and the Nacogdoches Film Festival during the Spring. If you're living in town, everything is pretty close and in walking distance, which is nice. If you're into the outdoors, there are plenty of nature trails that you can walk or bike. It's rather affordable to live; some of the nicer places cost about the same as a low end place in the city. That being said, there really isn't much to do. There are a lot more amenities in Lufkin, which is a 20-30 min drive away.

"I'm currently living at University Courtyard.   
Pros:  
1. Cheap Rent (I'm paying $569/per month for a two-bedroom apt)  
2. It's pretty close to Campus and restaurants   
3. Staff is pretty nice  
4. Has these cool built-in wardrobes, which saves you from having to get a dresser  


Cons:  
1. Not the most aesthetically pleasing apt  
2. Not enough parking  
3. Potential safety hazard ever since Austin St reopened since there is no crosswalk and the apt complex is split by Austin St.  
4. Can't do laundry and lacks its own laundry facility; the laundromat across the street is pretty sketchy   
5. Roaches

"It basically comes down to what you want out of life. Since you're retired, you may not have a lot of ""requirements"" as someone else who needs work, singles, school etc.

Housing is starting to get out of hand but not quite there yet. $220k+ will get you a nice house. I'm not sure what you're used to, but that is pretty nice for most folks. There's a lot of larger homes with nice land if you can afford that. I wouldn't think of building in town since there's not much land for sale unless you're a ways out. There are smaller home neighborhoods that are pretty nice (1,500-2,200 sq ft). Then there are larger neighborhoods where the houses  are as big as you want to build. Right now isn't great to find homes, seems realty has slowed down since Covid hit. My parents are looking to move and kinda limited right now....your preferences might be wider though, who knows.

I mean, last I lived here was in college. I moved back recently after 20 years. Being a college town it was more fun then since most of the activities are clubs and drinking related. Now being in my 40s, I don't find it a fun place :/ The only place I enjoyed getting out to was Hastings, and that closed. Now Walmart is about the most entertaining place to go to.

"I'm not going to answer all of your questions, but I will address the job hunt:

This is a poor town.  Like, crazy poor.  The only money in town is in the hands of old conservatives, who are notorious for poor tipping, if they tip at all.  If you insist on taking a service job, work at a non-college bar.  College kids can't afford to tip, either.  Still, bar tips are always going to be better than restaurant tips.  Just don't expect to make tips the way you would in a larger city.  In my opinion, try to find a non-service job where you can get experience that will serve you after you graduate.  Service jobs are dead weight on a post-college resume.

"1. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with student living anymore, so I'm not sure. 


2. There are a ton of churches. But as a student, you'll be around mostly younger people, which aren't as conservative/superstitious as the boomers+. You'll be fine as a non religious person with your peers. 


3. There are some great local restaurants. Legit Viet place in the shitty mall called T's Sandwiches. Best Mexican place is El Jaliscience (sp?) on North St. The Fredonia Hotel has what would probably be considered the ""nicest"" restaurant in town, The Republic Steakhouse. There are a couple of other restaurants in the hotel that are good, too. That's downtown. There are a few food trucks that park at random spots, and in normal times are usually downtown, especially for events. Blue Horse Bakery is downtown, it's a really great custom cake bakery, but it's also open to the public and has baked goods every day.  


4. There's the Fredonia Brewery downtown. There's the Front Porch Distillery north of town. There are 2 wineries, Naca Valley and Red House. There's a farmer's market every Saturday morning, always a ton of fresh produce, eggs, baked goods, cheese, etc. It's also a good place to hear about events going on. 

The music scene in Nac is actually pretty good. There are quite a few old hippies in town who are constantly having musicians come to town. You'll have the typical shit-kicker country music, but there's also a lot of Americana, Bluegrass, Blues, Jazz, etc. The Live Oak Listening Room is really neat. It used to just be a private thing, but has grown a lot. Very casual, used to be potluck but I'm not sure anymore, BYOB. Macklemore's on North St has a lot of live music. There's Banita Creek Hall, which is the country bar.  But there's also a smaller venue attached to it that will have smaller shows, with varying genres. I'm sorry, I can't remember the name. 

5. Busiest places are Jalepeno Tree on University, Barkeeps on North St, El Ranchero on King St, Clear Springs and Auntie Pasta's on Old Tyler. As far as tips go, I can't really say. 


Oh, and the water park is definitely child-oriented. There's not really much for kids older than 14 or so.

"I feel like it’s months late and it’s probably not going to be enforced.

This is a summarized history of what has happened in Texas that someone wrote up...


1.	⁠State had an outbreak of Coronavirus
2.	⁠Folks in charge tried to lock us down to prevent spread (like they should) but other people apparently felt a certain way about it
3.	⁠Owner of a hair salon in Dallas who may or may not have been funded by a Super PAC tried to forcibly reopen, had a judge get mad at her, and because of her big public brouhaha, Gov. Abbott decided that maybe we should just fast track reopening
4.	⁠Meantime, Lt. Gov. was saying how old people should be willing to die for the economy
5.	⁠Trump was both provoking State Governors and praising Abbott on reopening so fast.
6.	⁠Restaurants and bars were supposed to be at 25% capacity, but apparently that may have been taken as only a ""suggestion"", along with Covid prevention procedure  (i.e. masks, social distancing, etc.)
7.	⁠Folks trying to enforce mask policy were verbally and physically threatened, so a lot of folks stopped.
8.	⁠Masks became viewed as a ""political"" thing, so a lot of folks stopped wearing them due to their own leanings.
9.	⁠Folks on TV said Covid was fake. Folks at events said it was a hoax. People listened and basically didn't care anymore.
10.	⁠Curve didn't flatten
11.	⁠some folks got 1200 bucks from government, a lot didn't.
12.	⁠A lot of businesses applied for money from the government to keep them afloat, pay employees, etc, but not many got it
13.	⁠a lot of folks didn't make rent and were evicted
14.	⁠a lot of folks who should've got a check didn't because banks or the government took it to pay debts and student loans
15.	⁠a lot of folks lost jobs - laid off or quit due to health issues/concerns
16.	⁠we kept reopening
17.	⁠people had to go to work and a lot were getting sick.
18.	⁠hospitals were getting packed, but Abbott said we had beds
19.	⁠a lot of folks dying, and some from ""pneumonia-like"" symptoms - a lot higher than in recent years
20.	⁠we still kept reopening
21.	⁠memorial day weekend - people partying, no masks, no social distancing, crammed in together
22.	⁠numbers keep going up
23.	⁠2 weeks and change later, numbers now 6000 new cases a day
24.	⁠Abbott - everything fine, lots of beds
25.	⁠days later, now 8000 new cases a day
26.	⁠Abbott slowly panicking and saying maybe we should walk reopening back, wear masks (but not for the individual, mandates the business should make them wear it)
27.	⁠more people sick
28.	⁠People STILL can't wear masks properly - can't cover nose, can't cover mouth, use as chin or neck warmer.
29.	⁠Bar Lives Matter protests in Kilgore and other places, bars wanna reopen, salon lady involved - has now a ""non-profit"" for donations?
30.	⁠Lt. Gov. disputes claims of Dr. Anthony Fauci, immunologist and basically the most knowledgeable person in the country about the virus. Says he won't listen to Fauci, says Fauci ""doesn't know what he's talking about"".
31.	⁠You Are Here  <--

"The Native Plant Center off Raguet is nice and rarely busy. But I especially enjoy the Mast Arboretum behind the SFA art building/intramural fields, the Ruby Mize garden next to it on the east, and the Gayla Mize Garden east across University from them.

The Lanana Creek Trail is great, and it runs through the Mast Arboretum and Ruby Mize garden, and further north it goes through the back of the Native Plant Center.

At the back north/east corner of the Gayla Mize garden there are some rough trails primarily used for mountain/trail biking, but I like walking back there too.

"I believe the hill you’re referencing is a few miles outside of town on Highway 21 heading west towards Douglass. It’s a big lookout where you can see for miles and miles— it is certainly a great place to catch a sunset, regardless. If you head that way it’d be hard to miss. You can park off to the side of the road.

The Lanana Creek trail is the most popular trail in town. It’s a quality trail that runs parallel to said creek. The main portion runs from Liberty Hall on Main Street all the way to Austin Street. It goes through both Pecan Park, which is the best park in town, and SFA.

"**Disclaimer:** I had no intention of writing a book but I guess I have too many opinions.

One of my favorite Mexican places around town is La Braza, on South St. past the loop. It's a little hard to pull in and out of, and I think they (still) only take cash, but it's all cooked over mesquite charcoal and maaaaaan. You can get a whole chicken and accoutrements for like $12-15.

Date night spot is probably Fredonia or the steak house. A little less formal, probably Auntie Pastas.

Mak's and Auntie Pastas and I think Barkeeps have good HH specials. I can't remember what Flash is like now, it can be okay but it's felt increasingly customer-hostile for years and years now- I could post a whole thread about it.

There was a great Cajun place on South and Fredonia, which moved into Sports Shack. It had a burger with Andouille mixed into the meat and it was worth twice what they charged for it. Not sure if they're still going or not but the family that ran it were awesome.

Best pastor nowadays is probably at Tacos Dianita, where ""The Taco Stand"" (El Chile Picoso) used to be back in the day. They throw it down on the traditional Jalisco fare, have a great breakfast, and have some pretty baller banana-leaf wrapped tamales on Friday and Saturday. They used to- and I shit you not- have a whole bone-in piece of dark meat chicken in each tamal. Last time I went, they were just normal pork.

A lot of people don't seem to know about the pupuseria on University. They have some really good Salvadorian food but can be really slow for lunch, but everything is made to order. I'd call ahead and do pickup.

Peking just moved and I haven't been to their new location, but I'd take it over any of the other Chinese in town any day.

"I'm gonna echo /u/maxbastard and agree the timing might not be right for anything in person at the moment.  The library is still only in phase 1 of opening to the public, so it's just book pick-ups for now, but you might call anyway and let them know you'd like to do that in the future.  That's exactly the kind of stuff they like to host.

If you have time to edit videos, you might start a channel on YouTube.  Lots of tutorials there are nice and casual, and they can get a lot of views if you have the right feel. If you do, I'll watch it!  I've been wanting to learn Photoshop myself, so send me a link!  

Good luck with whatever you end up doing!  😄",t2_5qwto,Peppermint42,0,1592791396.0,0,t1_fvlhcqz,fvlhcqz,True,DesignerTex,t3_hdfii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nacogdoches/comments/hdfii6/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_local_photoshop/,Would anyone be interested in a local Photoshop class/meetup?,/r/Nacogdoches/comments/hdfii6/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_local_photoshop/fvlhcqz/,2,r/Nacogdoches,0,2
I know Greg Patterson has taught classes at SFA and then own his own to the general public as well as kid classes. I worked w/ him for my undergrad in photojournalism but tbh I’m out of practice and down shoot much w/ outdated gear. But you may want to get in contact w/ him to have some networking w/.,t2_3ox15oyq,ImAnAwkwardUnicorn,0,1592780394.0,0,t1_fvkzmy5,fvkzmy5,True,DesignerTex,t3_hdfii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nacogdoches/comments/hdfii6/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_local_photoshop/,Would anyone be interested in a local Photoshop class/meetup?,/r/Nacogdoches/comments/hdfii6/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_local_photoshop/fvkzmy5/,2,r/Nacogdoches,0,2
