"Thanks for chiming in! Love hearing the different points of view!

Public Domain is dope! Stumptown is still good but jumped the shark some years ago. Blue Star is a donut place; they got coffee, but I wouldn't put it in this type of discuss (that's just me, lol). 

Sweet Donkey has always been great when I've been there. I'll admit I'm no coffee snob or whatever, but I got really accustomed to tasting great coffee all the time while living in Portland for over 10 years. I knew plenty of coffee snobs and drank plenty of top-end coffee that they respected (Deadstock, Barista, and Sterling cafes stand out), including with a buddy who has an incredibly precise pallet to the point he was the lead bean buyer for Stumptown for years because of how spot on his taste buds are. So I'm not a coffee snob and will often drink whatever, but I know what great coffee tastes like (or is supposed to taste like), if that makes sense. All that being said, SD noticeably tastes more like what would be ""good coffee"" in Portland than RND.

**ADDED:** I see you added some price info - cool! I haven't been to Stumptown in years due to the BS they were doing and going through a while ago, but they're controlled by a company out of NYC, so it wouldn't surprise me if their prices were being set artificially high and/or were being raised because less people go there then 10+ years ago before their ""coolness"" in the city fell (*ex: many brunch spots all stopped carrying their coffee, so that revenue stream has dried up*).",t2_oml3b,WinesburgOhio,0,1648212521.0,0,t1_i224gnh,i224gnh,False,ownseagls,t3_tmve27,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tmve27/coffee_culture/,Coffee culture,/r/roanoke/comments/tmve27/coffee_culture/i224gnh/,2,r/roanoke,0,2
"I respectfully disagree. Sweet Donkey always tastes REALLY acidic to me, and their flavors are the same generic flavors you can get at any coffee shop. I do love the vibe of that place though. I don't think Sweet Donkey would even get looked at compared to Public Domain, Stumptown, or Blue Star tbh, it's simply not as good and the flavors aren't exciting.

RND would though, because their seasonal flavors offer a unique experience and overall the food their is pretty next level for a coffee shop.

All that said I don't think there is any coffee shop in the world that could peel me away from Public Domain.

Edit\* got one of the names of a place in Portland wrong

"Coffee culture and quality in Roanoke isn’t that great tbh. I worked in the coffee industry for 5ish years. 4 in Roanoke, 1 in Charlottesville.

Sweet donkey is a cool place and has capable baristas, but I personally don’t like the roasts they have that much. Their espresso drinks are pretty good though!

Mill mountain sucks, it’s really over roasted and a lot of their beans smell styrophoamy. Their baristas are paid minimum wage and are completely untrained. Expect really shitty coffee and drinks from there. 

I’ve heard good things about RND but I haven’t tried it since I quit coffee 😅

Unfortunately, most other coffee places in Roanoke are staffed by people that have 0 clue what they’re doing and don’t get paid enough to care. The largest coffee house going demographic in Roanoke is old dudes who’ve smoked too much and can’t taste what they’re drinking. The apathy is real, there isn’t demand for quality stuff here because people think what they have is good enough.

It’s the same thing with food, and it gets worse the further southwest you go. For example, in the Pulaski/Blacksburg area everyone thinks “Sal’s” is the best goddamn Italian food they’ve ever had in their lives. I had co workers cheer for the day the company bought us fucking sal’s. That shit was the most disgusting Italian food I’ve ever eaten 😂 0/10. They just don’t know, because they’ve never tried anything better.

I will say though, Champloo Bubble tea and ice cream is some of the best bubble tea on the east coast.

Also, we have really struggled to find a community here because it is so transit. We are exploring options of places to move and Roanoke has moved to the top of the list. We really enjoy paddle boarding, hiking, backpacking, mtn biking and road biking. I will say the best thing about living where we live is that we can easily leave our home and hop on a trail to bike or hike without driving. We also love going out to restaurants and brewery’s when we can. From what I have read it seems that Roanoke offers a lot of those things. Any feedback would be really helpful!! We are just trying to understand the place a bit.

"Not yet.  Maybe in 5-10 years.

One of the reasons IPv6 is being deployed (and also why CGNAT - Carrier Grade Network Address Translation is used) is because the world is running out of IPv4 addresses.  If you remember the Y2K debacle where dates were going to run out of digits - ipv4 has a similar issue.  There are only about 4 billion possible IPv4 addresses and since the rollout of Internet Of Things (IoT) devices, a smart phone in every pocket, multiple computers per household, etc, we are quickly running out.

An IPv4 address is x.x.x.x where each x represents a number from 0 to 255, so 256 total possible numbers in each block.  256x256x256x256 = 4,294,967,296 possible numbers.

Some of the issue is resolved by using a router in your home that only consumes a single IP and allowing all the devices in your home (Local Area Network) to have a special private IP address (usually starting with 192.x.x.x, sometimes with 10.x.x.x or 172.x.x.x).  Your router can determine what traffic belongs to which device and send the data to the right place.  This is called Network Address Translation or NAT.

Some ISPs (like GloFiber in their default setup) use 'CGNAT"" or Carrier Grade NAT.  Basically, they have their own set of IP addresses that they 'own' and can operate on and for all the customers who don't need public/external IPs, they do their own form of NAT to stretch out how many external IPs they consume.  The issue is if you have things like IP Security cameras or your own web server, you won't be able to get an ISP to forward all that type of traffic to you so your router can get it to your device.  Many ISPs are happy to set up customers who request it with an external IP address (sometimes at a fee, sometimes for no charge).

Eventually, even CGNAT won't be enough to keep up and we'll just need more addresses.  That's where IPv6 comes in.  Instead of only 32bits of data (giving us that 4.294 billion possible IPv4 addresses), IPv6 is 128bit and can therefore have 340 undecillion (thats 340 with 36 more zeros after it) different addresses.  Those will never run out.

But right now, no common applications require IPv6.  Many support and can make use of it but since so many ISPs don't yet support IPv6, game and app developers are not building their apps to only use it.",t2_4nw00,nhluhr,0,1648139349.0,0,t1_i1y5sn7,i1y5sn7,False,skadeda,t3_tlbu8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tlbu8i/is_glo_fiber_more_reliable_than_cox/,Is Glo Fiber more reliable than Cox?,/r/roanoke/comments/tlbu8i/is_glo_fiber_more_reliable_than_cox/i1y5sn7/,2,r/roanoke,0,2

"Public transit only goes to certain areas and most people in and around the city travel to and from the outskirts anyway.

"Hey, I work with a lot of people with food instability. So here's a few I take them to and what I've learned about them. I'm not 100% sure of economic restrictions as most people I work with meet the criteria. Most just ask for IDs. 

Christian soldiers: parking on the street but its generally pretty open. They just need your ID. Open tuesday-saturday from 10-12 I do believe. You can go once a week. 

Rosalind hills: drive through food pantry with a clothes closet. There is parking. They are only open on Mondays and Thursdays though. They generally just ask for your name, amount of people in your household.

Catholic Charities (st. Francis house): they ask for your address and how many in your household. Open monday-friday until noon I do believe. They do have a parking lot. 

It also depends on where you live, but Salem has a food pantry as do most counties. The rescue mission also has a food pantry but I don't know much about it. 

I also echo what other people have said, contact feeding Southwest Virginia. Contact virginia 2-1-1. See if you qualify for Snap. There are a lot of good resources out there and people ready to help.

Literally just arrived in Roanoke from Arizona yesterday. We are trail runners and mountain bikers and wanted to escape the heat and insane growth of AZ. We chose Roanoke for the reasons you mention. We haven’t experienced the humidity and we assume it will take time to adjust to from the dry desert but I’m so ready for seasons and a different type of people. I am so blown away at the friendliness we are experiencing all ready. We opted for the Hollins area mostly for its quick access to places like Carvins Cove and the AT as well as because it’s a bit more diverse than some of the other suburbs in the south county.,t2_d4h7hpp3,Becoming_wilder,0,1647821542.0,0,t1_i1gxonx,i1gxonx,True,CallMeD1234,t3_tiesc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tiesc9/should_i_move_to_roanoke/,Should I move to Roanoke?,/r/roanoke/comments/tiesc9/should_i_move_to_roanoke/i1gxonx/,4,r/roanoke,0,4

"Allot of folks like Vinton but it’s too.. idk… white and meh to me. There are some interesting areas there, but I much prefer the city; I’m a big fan of Wasena since it’s close to the city. I would often walk downtown and then to Grandin before heading back to Wasena and depending on which route you take there’s opportunity to cross two lovely bridges that cross over water and ya can walk through several parks as well as pass by several restaurants, bars and shops.. or hit the greenway (which runs from Salem to vinton and is great to bike on). The walk/round trip could be anywhere from 5-10 miles depending on how ya walk it.

I wouldn’t really recommend Salem (I mean it’s “nice” but the people are kinda snobby), Botetourt, Bedford/Daleville… but definitely browse around.. see what ya like.

One other consideration is retirement. 

Roanoke City has their own pension plan, it isn't bad, but it isn't state funded. Roanoke County is VRS (Virginia Retirement System) and the benefit to that is if you were to move to most any other department in the state (be it fire, police, or any other state agency) your time spent in Roanoke County would still count toward your retirement in the next place.

"It’s fairly diverse; Like most southern cities it does have a history steeped in segregation however the direct community is very diverse and inclusive. The surrounding areas (Franklin county, Roanoke county, Botetourt county, Bedford, Vinton) not so much. Franklin county is okay however once ya get away from the city (Roanoke), the rural areas are full of older-whites with older-whites mindsets. There is a “Trump Cult” vibe and “Trump Town” is one of the most off-putting things about the area. (There’s literally a place called “Trump-Town” with a bunch of tacky/gaudy yard-signs, banners, flags and the like.) So.. yeah, that’s a thing.

"My wife and I made a very similar move.  We lived in Gypsum, Colorado (Eagle County) and the COL just got to be too much.  We were both working two jobs, were getting nowhere close to home ownership, and then we had a kid.  Factoring childcare, we basically realized saving was going to be impossible.  We looked at moving to a few different places, and Roanoke won out.  In large part because we have family in the area. 

Anyway, to some of your points, Roanoke is pretty outdoorsy!  Not like a mountain town in Colorado, but really we have felt pretty satisfied with the hiking and biking (miss the skiing but we knew that going in!).  The mountain biking is really awesome, the hiking is pretty abundant nearby, with some good trails in the city as well (if you come visit and want to get a sense of some local trails, check out Read Mountain Preserve, Chestnut Ridge, Mill Mountain Park, and any one of the nearby access points to the Appalachian Trail...for biking head to Carvin's Cove).  If you fish, there's some pretty awesome fishing nearby, some within city limits.  Also, there's some fun small mountain towns within an hour (Paint Bank, Floyd, if you go a little further Abingdon and Damascus).  

Restaurants and breweries are pretty abundant for a smaller city as well.  There's also a decent amount of diversity (my understanding is that Roanoke is pretty historically segregated and this seems to be true...Southwest within city limits seems to have the most diversity but I'm probably not familiar enough at this point to know for sure).  It's definitely more diverse than where we were coming from, so that's been a huge plus for us especially as we raise our kid.  

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  I miss aspects of Colorado, but my wife and I have enjoyed Roanoke so far.  It's less of a hustle just to make ends meet, the people have been really friendly, and it certainly offers more by way of cultural activities.",t2_3ug0t,tennmyc21,0,1647792213.0,0,t1_i1f0fzg,i1f0fzg,True,CallMeD1234,t3_tiesc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tiesc9/should_i_move_to_roanoke/,Should I move to Roanoke?,/r/roanoke/comments/tiesc9/should_i_move_to_roanoke/i1f0fzg/,7,r/roanoke,0,7

I suggest taking a look at Wasena, Old SW, Grandin Village, too for the city.

"Most days it is relatively easy to get out of downtown. You onlybhave to worry on certain Holidays when they block off parts of Cambell for festivals and/or parades which is usually for St. PATRICKS day, Christmas, though during Christmas they have Dickens of a Christmas every friday or saturday during December. 
The part of Cambell that is blocked off is between Jeffrson st and Williamson rd
Williamson rd is one of the Main roads and you are close to the interstate which is good regarfing access. 
Downtown is Close to the Greenway trail and there is Hiking in the area, closest one would be Mill Mountain though if you want more challenging ones such as Dragons Tooth, Macafees Knob etc, it will be a longer drive but that is what that close access to the interstate is for.
Crime downtown is relatively low in my opinion. Most thing to worry about is the homeless which isnt that big of a threat, mainly an annoyance of being asked for money. Several do have mental health issues but are relatively harmless (but caution should always be taken). 
Sometimes they sneak into parking garages to sleep and stuff but in all the years I have been around downtown I have not heard of any major altercations or incidents. 
There are a couple of grass areas people take there dog. 2nd and Cambell is one and the other is by the Wachovia tower. 
You do get a residential discount on parking in the Park Roanoke garages. Their office is on Church Street across from Roanokes ""Millionares Club"" the Texas Tavern. 
No grocery stores downtown but there is a small co-op store on the Market.

"Glade creek apartments are nowhere near close enough to downtown to walk there. It's probably a ~15 minute drive with traffic to get to downtown from there, which isn't terrible. I have heard a lot of not great things about that apartment complex, though so I would definitely tour the place in person before committing. I know my next statement is going to upset quite a few people but it's honestly the truth: **violent** crime in Roanoke is almost exclusively drug related and either inside or immediately surrounding the melrose-rugby area of NW, which is not very close to the market area. Don't go looking to buy or sell drugs in Melrose and you're really not in any danger in Roanoke.

"Dogs(esp greyhounds): animal care center of Salem we take our dogs there because one is a grey and they need specialized anesthesia and ACCoS sees a lot of greys.

Cats: vets to cats. They see nothing but cats. Makes them good at knowing... cats. Plus less stressful for cats to go to an office w/ no strange dogs.

Everything else: roanoke avian and exotic. Heck, for a second opinion on a dog or a cat I'd take them there. For any complex animal disease I'd take any animal there. I trust Dr. Stewart more than my own human doctors - if I could go to him I would lol. He's easily the best vet I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with - but he us a little pricier, the clinic is tiny (for a mostly avian base makes sense), and I've only ever seen a dog at the clinic once (i don't know if they see dogs or cats routinely).",t2_3dvje,clawsight,0,1647522176.0,0,t1_i10ht2c,i10ht2c,True,futureinroanoke,t3_tg13ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tg13ha/what_veterinarians_do_you_recommend/,What veterinarians do you recommend?,/r/roanoke/comments/tg13ha/what_veterinarians_do_you_recommend/i10ht2c/,6,r/roanoke,0,6

You may try and find a local contractor that does foundation repair first.  My experience with JES is that they are there to find stuff and upsell you.  Had some minor settlement and some brick split.  JES guy first told me i needed 9 helical piers at about 10k.  I said no thank you and magically the number started going down over a few days to about 4 piers at 7k.

I think what will be key is whether Roanoke will be proactive in addressing housing affordability before it becomes an issue. Most cities are reactive and already in crisis mode and it's so much harder to catch up.

I get your worry about it getting crazy. I don’t think Roanoke is on the road to that type of craziness. Asheville is and that’s why we vetoed it after it was initially our target area.

"Lawson is very slow to do literally anything. Also they promise and then don't deliver. 

Had a Toilet issue, only one toilet, they couldn't get anyone out for 24 hours, I offered to pay and take it off rent, they refused any servicer that wasn't their own in house.

They did an inspection and discovered a leak in my bathroom. They said they needed to replace all the flooring. they sent one guy over for 2 and a half weeks when it could've been done in 24/48 hours by 2-3 people.

Snow Removal apparently came with the townhouse. Guess who never showed up for snow removal? I always cleared the walkway for all neighbors and had to shovel my own path for my car.

The guy who mows the lawns is cool though, he's always prompt but he's contracted and runs his own business.

Anything you need from Lawson is a pain in the ass. I rented from CW Francis prior and they were always good to us and then the owner changed leasing companies. It was all downhill then.

"My couples group did a Roanoke Amazing Race. 

1) We went to the star and had to eat a beanboozled jelly bean to move on. 

2) Roanoke Public Library where we had to find a specific book to move on. (Virginia Room holds the Libraries’ non-circulating historical and genealogical research resources. Would be fun to find their link to Roanoke or see if there are any books pertaining to the person's genealogy. 

3) One of the museums in the Center in the Square. (I would suggest the Science Museum's new parakeet garden.) 

4) Taubman Museum of Art. (Afrofuturism in Costume Design ends 4/3. 60 costumes on display by Academy Award-winning costume designer Ruth E. Carter. Costumes from movies such as films like Black Panther, Coming 2 America, Selma, and Do the Right Thing. They are also offering paint your pet at home kit for $55. The kit includes a 16x20 canvas with your pet’s portrait already drawn out, a set of 24 acrylic paints, a 10 piece set of paintbrushes, and a color print-out of your pet for reference. You’ll also receive a link to a step-by-step instructional video to guide you through the process and get that creativity going.) 

5) Buy and drink a Slurpee. (This could be replaced with food/drink at a brewery or restaurant. Tuquo's is my fav.)

Other places I would suggest: 

Roanoke area: Scratch Biscuit, Black Dog Salvage,  make pottery at Glazed Bisque-It, set up a photo shoot with a local photographer,   Virginia Museum of Transportation, The Heartworks Company paint night, visit all the LOVE signs in the area, hit up antique/thrift stores, play a board game at Blade Gaming, Mill Mountain Zoo, Rosie Gaming Emporium, rent a gun and range at Safeside. 

Around the area: Alpacas of Smith Mountain Lake Farm, rent a boat and fish at Smith Mountain Lake, Natural Bridge, Hull's Drive-In (Lexington), Peaks of Otter, Beale's Brewery, The D Day Memorial, Seaquest, Thomas Jefferson's Poplar Forest, take the parkway to Floyd to eat and visit shops, Friday Night Jamboree at the Floyd Country Store.

Eating challenges are popular in show. 

I recommend  eating the peanut soup at the Hotel Roanoke for some historic fun.  I think it's Martha Washington's recipe or something. Regardless, peanut soup is old Virginia at its finest, and the lobby and dining room is cool.

Also, the shrimp and grits from Billy's! I heard (but can not confirm all of this) that back in the day, all of the Market Square area was bars for the people working on the trains.  When Prohibition hit, everything closed except the bar that became Billy's. The business went ""dry"" but could stay open because they had ""cat house"" services and used it to pivot and stay afloat. There's a historic bar in the restaurant, and if they're not busy, sometimes the bar tenders will talk to you about it.",t2_bdwdqjg0,monster_on_holiday,0,1647010947.0,0,t1_i08wkjl,i08wkjl,True,Kord642,t3_tbjqof,https://www.reddit.com/r/roanoke/comments/tbjqof/helping_a_friend_plan_a_road_trip/,Helping a friend plan a road trip,/r/roanoke/comments/tbjqof/helping_a_friend_plan_a_road_trip/i08wkjl/,5,r/roanoke,0,5
"Dublin (1hr from South if Roanoke) is next to my hometown - it’s small very rural, farm lands, rednecks, a lake, not a lot to do in social arena and a Volvo plant which employs majority of the Blue collar workers isn’t hat area.

Lynchburg is a SMALL city overrun by college students. Not a lot going on there your pretty central in Virginia so your not far from activities or other cities. 

Roanoke - lived there for 5 years - I would recommend living close around Roanoke city & county area. Breweries, restaurants, major area hospital (T1 center).

I live in Franklin County which borders Lynchburg and Roanoke to the north East and Dublin and wytheville are more North west. Roanoke is a cool city. I’m originally from Los Angeles so Roanoke is probably the closest busiest. Christiansburg and Dublin are slightly more rural feeling then Roanoke. So depending how busy or non busy you like it. I got one love the quiet Franklin county. Moved from Floyd county which is in between Christiansburg and Franklin. That town used to be quiet but too many outsiders and no room in the town.
