1. The marina is in poor shape. Docks are shabby and the place needs a complete refresh.  Go check out Farms marina and you will see a well maintained marina. Ours is just shabby .

2. The grounds on Windmill park are not so nice.  Again look at Farms park. 

3. The pool has seen better days. Pool surrounded by big slab of uneven concrete

3 Mile park is in better shape but little access for lake swimming other than slippery boat launch.   Should have a beach access. Just my opinion 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like the the parks  as the Park but I pay a lot on taxes , but I think the amenities should be better taken care of.  

Movie theater is big plus and people/kids are better behaved ( quieter) than you will find in the greater metro area.

"Hey hey and welcome! We just moved here too.  As the other poster said, everyone only has access to the parks in your own city.  

The GPP pass application is available here: [https://www.grossepointepark.org/departments/parks\_\_\_recreation/park\_pass\_info/index.php](https://www.grossepointepark.org/departments/parks___recreation/park_pass_info/index.php)

Mine came relatively quickly.   You get a pass for each adult in the house and you show it at the entry gate, where they scan the card for entry.  Even if you're on foot/bike.    

Also, if you make friends with people in other Pointe's, they can always invite you over to their parks.   

When I was looking for a home, there was a day when all the parks were open for anyone that went to an open house and got a little ""Get in all the parks for free"" pass.  So I went to all of them: Park, City, Shores, Woods, and Farms.  They're all really well maintained parks with good amenities.  While the Park for Grosse Pointe Woods is the largest (though, it's also actually in Saint Clair Shores, geographically), the nicest parks were the ones in Grosse Pointe Park, IMHO.

"We‚Äôre old and have lived in the Woods for decades . We love it here and we even live in the North end of the City on the wrong side of Mack . City services are outstanding . 

I‚Äôve been to all of the Grosse Pointe Parks and the Woods is my favorite  for the 1.7 mile walking/jogging/biking  path and the pool alone . 

We walk everywhere on Mack , lots of restaurants to choose from the new Starbucks on Mack and Hollywood is nice and I‚Äôve heard great things about ‚Äú Estia Greek Street Food ‚Äú that‚Äôs opening next door . 

Check out the Eleanor and Edsel Ford House next to the Woods Park , just a gorgeous place to walk . The new Continental restaurant there with views of Lake St Clair and Fords Cove has excellent food and service . Lots of family activities throughout the year too. 

Membership isn‚Äôt necessary to eat at the restaurant. But is only $45 a year for an individual plus ( 2 people ) and allows entry to the property daily for walks . Discounts on events etc .

Also try some of the restaurants on the Nautical Mile , Like Mikes on The Water . Nautical Deli has great sandwiches, they‚Äôre  just north of 9 mile on Jefferson .

We Love the easy access to Detroit‚Äôs Sports , Museums and restaurants you get from living in the Pointes. Royal Oak , Birmingham are easy access too . 

Close proximity to Belle Isle / Lake St Clair Metro Park/ Detroit‚Äôs River Walk .

I‚Äôm betting you will like living in the Woods or any of the Pointes .

"Not too far off actually. Just got married and planning on a child in the next year or so.

We've been looking at Royal Oak/Ferndale/Pleasant Ridge, Plymouth, and the Pointes because they all have a commonality - Walkable downtowns with restaurants and parks. My wife's family is from suburban Metro-Detroit. As in, everything is separated by mile roads with 4 lanes of 50 MPH traffic. I hate that. We walk fast, are young, and in good shape so walking a mile is easy for us and not that slow. But, that doesn't mean I want to walk a mile every time I want to go to a restaurant or park.

We have a bit more to spend than that $350k, but finding places in GPP, GP, and GPF in that price range that doesn't need significant overhaul as proven to be a bit difficult. When we have found one, we go after it but just haven't gotten it. Which is why our lens shifted a bit towards GPW, where there are some more houses in our price range that don't need a ton of work. Problem is that takes us out of the walkable characteristic of the other Pointes.",t2_3hhwh4t4,ImGoingtoRegretThis5,0,1630329897.0,0,t1_haxcng4,haxcng4,False,ImGoingtoRegretThis5,t3_pddxaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrossePointe/comments/pddxaj/moving_to_one_of_the_grosse_pointes/,Moving to one of the Grosse Pointes,/r/GrossePointe/comments/pddxaj/moving_to_one_of_the_grosse_pointes/haxcng4/,1,r/GrossePointe,0,1
"You stated ""future family"" so I assume that eventually, in approximately 5 years you will be using the GPPSS (grosse pointe public school system). From your post, it seems that you want the urban feel with the amenities and safety of a suburb. You did not state your price range so I'm going to guess below $350K. 

Although I live in the Woods, I will highly suggest that you look in Grosse Pointe Farms for several reasons. Their park is a great location. The Farms has The Hill area with restaurants then a few blocks south you can be in the Village. The resale value is good in the Farms as well . The homes in all the Grosse Pointes are old and many are dated in decor. Many people have upgraded or renovated their homes. 

The closer you are to Lake Shore drive, the more desirable the location. Generally all the Pointes are good.

O.o go get vaccinated so you don't have to worry about the negative side effects of covid.  Or there is always home school if your so worried you will get covid.  Check your temp daily.  Your children have a very low chance of going to the hospital with covid.  They are more likely to go in for the flu.  Those masks are killing our immune system.  Our kids are going to have weak immune systems.  I got sick alot as a kid.  So I very rarely get sick as an adult.  You people just need to get over it.  Get vaccinated and what problems will you have then.  Covid will be more like the common cold and won't put you in the hospital or down 6',t2_a0b2y6v9,TheRealSoulfinder,0,1629970894.0,0,t1_haelapb,haelapb,True,B00ger-Tim3,t3_p1498f,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrossePointe/comments/p1498f/parents_demand_action_after_grosse_pointe_public/,Parents demand action after Grosse Pointe Public Schools decides not to require masks,/r/GrossePointe/comments/p1498f/parents_demand_action_after_grosse_pointe_public/haelapb/,1,r/GrossePointe,0,1

Listen I am just letting you know the teachers' concerns and why they are doing what they are doing. You may feel it is safe for everyone to go back to normal but as you can tell from the teachers response they disagree with you. They believe that the positive impact of another month of strict covid rules outweighs the negative impact on learning. I don't necessarily disagree with that either as vaccines are only just recently getting widely distributed. And correct me if I am wrong but many of the kids are still not vaccinated. Plus the vaccines take time to actually gain their effectiveness. I personally think the 6ft social distancing rules as well as 14 day quarantine requirements will not have a greater negative impact on learning than the greater chance of a widespread covid outbreak in the schools. If we maintain these requirements for the remainder of the school year and re-evaluate towards the end of the summer when everyone has had a chance to get vaccinated I believe we will be much safer. But that's just my opinion.

They called in for a day to essentially protest the changes in policy lowering restrictions on covid safety procedures. They lowered the amount of time required for quarantining as well as lowering the social distancing requirements. This is because they had 1000+ kids who needed to quarantine due to the old rules so instead of trying to make conditions safer to ensure less kids are exposed they changed the requirements so kids just don't have to quarantine as long or as often to cut down on those large numbers. Vaccines help lower the chances of Covid spreading but it doesn't eliminate the risk of getting it completely. One teacher was hospitalized with COVID after getting vaccinated recently.

">put a good enough paywall 

Again, you've answered your own question.  The paywall is property taxes.  Across the 5 Pointes, the ""per resident"" cost to operate the parks varies between $150-225 per resident.  Cities spend somewhere between 15-20% of their annual general fund budget on the parks (one per city).   By contrast, the city of Detroit spends 8% of its annual budget on parks across the city.

Each municipality has their own park, as others have indicated, a Grosse Pointe Shores resident does not have access to the Grosse Pointe Woods park and vice versa.  This is true for all five Pointes.  To make this clearer, a Grosse Pointe Woods resident has no more access to the Grosse Pointe Shores park than people who live in St. Clair Shores, Roseville, Warren, Detroit, etc.  

Grosse Pointe Woods maintains Ghesquire Park which does not require a pass.  The Neighborhood Club and City of Grosse Pointe maintains tennis courts and a playground at Elworthy Field which can be accessed without a pass.

"It‚Äôs Catholic school, just for the more wealthy kids. It‚Äôs not any different academically from Star or any others. It all depends on your needs! They‚Äôll be just fine if they matriculate into public school, but if there‚Äôs any special services needed (speech therapy, early intervention) it for sure would be more advantageous to go public.

For what it‚Äôs worth, all of my friends who matriculated from local Catholic schools had no issues. My brother sends his kids (in Rochester) and said they are more hands on due to class sizes and the fact it‚Äôs private. They don‚Äôt put up with distractions and any disruptive kids can be removed at any time.

"You‚Äôre buying in a very high market - if you plan on reselling at any point, consider east of Mack if you‚Äôre shopping the woods.

We live in the woods and I‚Äôm not a big fan of the park. It lacks useful amenities outside dry storage/boat docks.  

Just remember to find a local realtor, these houses are OLD. You‚Äôll want someone who knows what to look for, even the cosmetically nicer homes can have issues that non-locals don‚Äôt really know about.

"I'm very biased toward GP City (where I currently live), but honestly you can't go wrong with any of the GP's.

Houses: Park and Woods are the most affordable, with Park homes being insanely charming while Woods homes are generally more modern and practical.  The City has a good mix of affordability vs. size, while Farms and Shores tend to be very expensive/overpriced (although, Shores homes seem to be coming down in price lately).  Anywhere in the Shores is damn close to the lake, so naturally it will be the most expensive, on average.

Schools - I'm sure everyone here will have strong opinions about this: Generally, all the schools are great, but I think the Farms and City have the best schools overall, but Park schools are very good too.  Shores and Woods share Middle and High School with Harper Woods, which some people really don't like while others are fine with it.

Downtown: the Park and City have amazing downtowns, while the Farms visually looks nice but honestly doesn't really have as much going on.  Shores doesn't have a downtown, and Woods is along Mack and not nearly as walkable as the others.

Parks and Rec: Farm's Park is big and gorgeous, while GP Park has 2 parks that are both on the the lake and have lots of amenities.  The City's park is tiny but decent.  I haven't been to the Shores or Woods parks so I can't comment on those.

People: Park and Woods are more on the young side, with the Park feeling more artsy/urban while the Woods feels more like an upscale St. Clair Shores.  Farms and Shores have a lot more older folks or young folks with money, and City feels like somewhere in the middle between Farms and Park.  I think a general trend is for families to start off in the Park or Woods and slowly gravitate toward the Farms or Shores, although there are plenty of people that stay in one of the GP's and never leave.  In any of the GP's you will usually find more young families on the north side of Kercheval, and older families south of Kercheval.

"All of the pointes are family friendly with a good stock of young families and couples. Grosse pointe park is by far the most youthful and most walkable. It also has the oldest stock of homes, most of which were built in the 1920s. Lots of character among the houses, I can walk the same path everyday and still see something new. Another perk of the park is that while each pointe has a private lakefront park, GPP has 2. One has a pool, marina, movie theatre, the other has a boardwalk and kayak launch area, splash pad, and soon a dog park. I‚Äôm biased but IMO the park is the best of all pointes unless you‚Äôre buying something on lakeshore or a 1 mill+ mansion. There‚Äôs everything from small bungalows, mid sized colonials, to mega mansions in the park. GPP in the winter is mediocre but in the summer it‚Äôs like living in a resort town. I can wake up, have coffee, go ride my bike to the park and take my kayak out and be home before lunch. 

Also as a side note, a lot of people are ‚Äúscared‚Äù due to the proximity of Detroit to GPP, and while occasional petty crime happens, it happens in ALL the pointes. I have never once felt unsafe here. I admit I was hesitant moving here because I didn‚Äôt really know anyone who had lived here and was unfamiliar with the area. I don‚Äôt see myself leaving anytime soon, it‚Äôs the best place to live in metro Detroit.

"Open letter from Superintendent published today:

To:  Cindy Pangborn, Lauren Nowicki, Lisa Papas



From:  Gary C. Niehaus, Superintendent

 

Your campaign ad was disgraceful, uninformed and divisive to the Grosse Pointe Public School System community.  

 

Our teachers and administration want grace but were totally disgraced by your campaign ad.

GPPSS is one of the top five public school districts in Michigan.  Our teachers are annually ranked the best teachers in Michigan.  The daily interaction and relationships between our teachers and students is second to none.  We need to let our teachers teach and our students learn.  We have had two Blue Ribbon Schools (Mason and Maire) in the last five years.  Many more of our schools have earned that distinction previously.  Our teachers have been awesome, creative and hard-working during Covid-19.  The teachers are giving their best and our students are trying to do their best.  We all know that Face to Face instruction is our best pedagogy.  Please give the teachers the credit they deserve.

 

Do your homework!  Your audit facts are inaccurate.

GPPSS has two clean audits from our auditors (Plante Moran).  All indications are that we are getting a third consecutive clean audit in October, 2020.  Our fund balance is 15% and continues to build with accounting and bookkeeping at the highest level ever.  The business department is second to none.

 

We have the Best Building Administrators anywhere.  Kate Murray, Moussa Hamka and Michelle Davis are all professional, well-qualified and deserve credit for running excellent high schools.  Nearly half of our administrative team have been hired with qualifications above and beyond our GPPSS expectations.  GPPSS has five building principals (John Kernan, Sara Delgado, Lisa Rheaume, Roy Bishop, Dan Hartley and soon to be Kate Murray)  that have earned their doctorate in the past three years.  Our GPPSS teachers have also earned advance degrees and continued coursework and professional development to be the best in their classrooms.  We are bringing our best to our students each and every day. And here are a few examples of that: 

Under Principal Murray and Hamka each school has the highest SAT/ACT test scores in the schools' history
Both North/South staff have been ranked the #1 HS teaching staffs in the state under the leadership of Principal Hamka, Murray and their team
GPPSS leadership has spearheaded diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as well as a reduction in suspensions through restorative practices
Our reinvigorated curriculum review process has led to the development of new courses and programs including expansion of career and technical education, STEM programming, and dual enrollment with colleges and universities
 

The advertisement also makes inaccurate claims regarding litigation. Mr. Hamka has not been sued for sexual harassment or for anything else. The litigation against the District initially involved claims of sexual harassment, but they were withdrawn by the Plaintiff and dismissed by the Court.

 

Board Members - Divisive and Disruptive

Cindy Pangborn has served with 12 different board members in my tenure.  She has been the dissenting vote on any and all district plans.  We need Board of Education members that can build consensus and bring the best ideas forward.  Dissenting is an important part of developing a plan in a democratic process. So is presenting solutions. And once a decision is made, then all board members need to support the approved plan.  Working together for the common good is what we need. 

 

Damage Done ...

Prospective parents, employees and potential superintendent candidates all read the Grosse Pointe News.  The campaign ad facts were inaccurate and misleading.  Who would want to come to the Grosse Pointe Public School system if they believed your damaging ad?  Enrollment and recruitment should be goals for all board candidates and community members.  Your campaign ads set us back.  Your campaign is designed to divide our community.

 

Administration does LISTEN!

You can choose to ignore the truth and facts about GPPSS or you might want to sit down and become informed.  Our administrative team has an open door and appreciates honest conversation about GPPSS. 

 

Lisa, Lauren and Cindy ... we need your candidacy to be positive and proactive!

Colleen Worden - assistant prosecutor, seems decently level-headed

Ahmed Ismail - he's been around for a long time, he has institutional knowledge that we probably want at this point, there are fair criticisms of him, he is more prepared than Pangborn.  He will often be a dissenting opinion, and have some ""out there"" statements, but he is a reasonable guy.

David Brumbaugh - he isn't part of any slate and has a tough time to win, but he seems to have a good technical background and good discernment

"A common sentiment among the FtF advocates is that they need schools to reopen so that they can go back to work assuming that their kids are being ""taught"" (baby sat, legally unattended, warehoused) in school. 

But they forget just how much more disruptive to work and school the on-again-off-again fact of face-to-face school will be.  All students in FtF will have to stop going to school buildings each time there is a record of an infected student or staff member on premises. With a quarantine, testing, and clearing of all humans who want to go back. Rinse repeat. Starting the school year with a consistent and less prone to change system in place is smarter.

 As a parent, I'm likely going to lose my mind assisting in remote teaching in the coming year. But I  also think it will be more robust remote teaching than the band-aid patch put on during the emergency lockdown during which the schools flipped their teaching within 48 hours.

"Hello there! I‚Äôm a new mod! üëæ

Moving forward, I believe in the fundamental importance of embracing a varied discussion that does not snuff out individual experience, ideas, and opinions based on perceived fact. 

As part of my fundamental belief, I do not subscribe to ‚ÄòGroup Think‚Äô and am willing to listen to others‚Äô point of view - as long as we are balanced in such a way that allows feedback from all of our community. 

Going forward, GP will have several evolutions of change to be concerned with. We‚Äôre all in this community together. We will not always agree with everything someone else says, believes, and does. This doesn‚Äôt mean we cannot listen to, with intent to understand, all points of view. 

As part of that change, I‚Äôd like to explore root causes of problematic changes that occur or have occurred. Right now, there is so much change and disruption that there shouldn‚Äôt be a lack of material to discuss. We have more to think about than I‚Äôve ever seen. 

Where and what do we want our community to be? We have something special that is worth protecting, but I cannot do it alone. It can be anything from the schools, safety issues, environmental issues, recreational options, marketing to attract businesses and new residents, and the priority of such issues that we are most concerned with. 

As an example: Lake St. Clair has been mostly ignored. How can we educate our kids in GPPSS to be aware of their actions and how it impacts Lake St. Clair, and downstream Detroit River & Great Lakes, giving them the understanding that grows in proper stewardship.

There are a plethora of things to discuss.

"I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you - entirely. 

My neighbor who has a daughter the same age as mine, and lives on the street, rode her bike back from work at Saint John ascension to our block just a few blocks away from the hospital.

Not one, not two, at least three patrol cars with lights surrounded her on a bike. She is a nurse. She also happens to be black. It scared her. She felt threatened. She was shocked. This affected her. I do not believe this would‚Äôve happened if she were Caucasian.

When I‚Äôm training for marathons, it‚Äôs not unusual for me to be running till 2 AM or even 4 AM. I‚Äôve never been accosted by the police for any reason being out at add hours.

While I love our Police, and I‚Äôm very good friends with one of the top officers in Grosse pointe Farms; yet, there was still a racial element to their response to my friend and neighbor (he was not involved).

None of us are immune to the filter through which we see the world - of our deeply ingrained biases. This is not the regular kind of bias. This is unconscious bias. It‚Äôs the kind of bias that you do not realize that you are carrying around with you every single day.

"Sure, mentioning ‚Äònice family‚Äô wasn‚Äôt against my favor in that situation. 

As far as the neighborhood, I enjoy it for the most part. Love the lake, Pier Park, running along lakeshore, and that our kids can still ride a bike to a friend‚Äôs house! We have a relatively safe community that‚Äôs tight knit, and all of the beautiful architecture. I also came here for the schools, which had some of the highest ratings in SE MI and even ranking nationally. 

At first, it seemed great. We were in the Woods. Spent four years there before heading to the Farms, where we‚Äôre on our 11th year. Fifteen years in this community. Wow. While still the Woods, the neighbors were very welcoming and friendly. However, the city began harassing us, and wouldn‚Äôt allow us our Lakefront Park passes. There‚Äôs so much detail to the level they went to, I could write a book. 

During our time in the Woods, we loved the elementary, even though it was far, and there was the necessary crossing of Mack Avenue. Excellent leadership under Keith Howell during that period.  It became trickier when my son was at Brownell. The house I leased during the recession was worth 20% of the mortgage debt by the time I was ready to buy (divorce), so I moved to the Farms, due to central location in GP & proximity to the schools. 

While I enjoy the Farms, and the city workers are amazing, the people were different. Not nearly as welcoming. My daughter was ostracized at Kerby by no other than the principal at that time (poor kid üò≠). We didn‚Äôt fit in here - and that was made clear on several occasions. 

Things have improved over the years, though the schools are the thorn in my side. I‚Äôve witnessed the deterioration in leadership on all levels. My youngest starts senior year this year. 

Sorry about the long post, as there‚Äôs so much more I‚Äôd like to share!

td;lr We had a great experience in the Woods, even the school and community of parents were more supportive. It became much stuffier after moving to the Farms, though I see some positive shifts. The outlier is our schools, the way my kids were harassed by teachers, principles, all the way up to a superintendent. 

For the record: my kids have not been in trouble of any kind. Though, they feel different, and I regularly question my decision to move here.

For example, the listing agent told the previous homeowner that ‚Äòa nice family‚Äô made the offer.

"We‚Äôre bound by federal fair housing law. Even though I began my real estate career in 2002, I didn‚Äôt have knowledge of the ‚Äòunder the table‚Äô types of discrimination that may or may not happen. 

Since my career path took me to IT, I have an active license here and there. So, when buying my home using a buyer‚Äôs agent other than myself, I was shocked by his trepidation concerning GP Realtors. This was only ten years ago.

Since, I‚Äôve worked through Johnstone & Johnstone. They had a decent person here or there, but it was not the experience I was hoping for. I have no doubt that it‚Äôs still happening, though likely far less than before. 

Fun fact: Grosse Pointe has their own Board of Realtors. Most boards stretch across large areas. I was once part of the WOCAR Board. (Not sure I remember the whole acronym). It was basically Western Wayne County and Oakland County. It is very strange to have a board just for Grosse Pointe.
