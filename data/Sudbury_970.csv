"A lack of physical buildings isn't the problem. Part of it is that these buildings have to meet the housing codes, many of which would cost an absolute fortune to convert. Another part is that, for the chronically homeless it's not just a matter of ""here's a home, you're not homeless anymore!"" Because they are often afflicted with addictions or mental health problems. 'Homes' come with rules, like not cooking meth in them, and not falling asleep smoking in them, and not using them as a place to sell drugs. Most places that house homeless need staff 24/7, they need a police presence, they need crisis intake, they need people trained to use naloxone kits. Also, these places turn into drug and prostitution cesspools when there's no staff on site.

I have no issues with Darian owning the wolves and even the arena, with a proper relationship to city hall of course. This KED business seems like bad timing given current economic circumstances.

From what I understand, there is nothing wrong with the structure of the existing main arena (aside from those horrible acoustics, which I think isnt fixable if I recall correctly).  And our downtown seems to need the most help in terms of economic stimulation.

"Those of you who make comments as to why we are still doing convoys despite the fact that the mask mandate has been lifted...have no understanding whatsoever as to what is really going on. Let me enlighten you. Have you ever heard of the World Economic Forum and and its founder, Klaus Schwab? And what about Bill Gates and his wish to ""downsize the Population"" by 2030? These two men, and many other sick people like them...want to own the world, and enslave those of us who survive the Genocide. If you, your family or friends have taken the shots (injections, NOT ""vaccines""), look around and see if they're ok...or if there aren't any unusual reactions or medical problems suddenly arising with them after getting the shots? And then come to me and tell me that there isn't something bad going on? Many people have been warning us about this for years, but no one would believe them...me included! But since two years, after having been educated about what was about to come, I've been joining protest groups in an effort to educate people and prevent a worldwide genocide from happening, starting with communities just like ours...where 80 to 90% of the people rushed to get injected with something that wasn't really approved by the FDA, and for which there is no insert explaining as to what is inside the shots. Since when does a young child suffer from heart inflammation or stroke?

Here's a news flash for you! Most of the so-called ""Conspiracy Theories"" have now come to pass.... Lockdowns, Self-Isolation, Social Distancing (Nothing social about that), and you think you are safe and ""back to normal"" now that the mask mandates are lifted? Just wait and see how many more ""Variants"" will come...and how fast ""The Powers That Be"" will want to RE-MASK EVERYBODY!

People used to call me crazy because I believe in the existence of UFOs and their occupants. Since 2017, UFOs have been declared a reality by several agencies...so I'm vindicated on that one!

Let's see what happens when the Grand Jury is made public, and you hear mention of Genocide, Worldwide Mass Murder, and the Crimes Against Humanity!

What is being done to the entire world today...was done to the Jewish people by Nazi Germany, way back in the late 1930s - early 1940s!  Learn your History!!!

"Salut Andrew !

Il y a plein de ressources √† ta disposition pour t'aider. The trick is exposure, exposure, exposure! So here's a list of what can help:

1- Ask your French speaking friends and family for help by requesting that to speak to you in French (and don't be afraid to remind them if they switch to English with you). I know many people who aren't comfortable speaking in French (mostly due to linguistic insecurities) and we have full-on conversations where I speak French and they, English.

2- Switch your devices' language (daily exposure)

3- Listen to francophone radio (Le Loup 98.1; ICI Musique 90.9; ICI Premi√®re 98.1)

4- Watch TV and movies in French, either subtitles or original content. tou.tv (Radio-Canada's version of GEM but that has existed long before) is free, but only 7,90/month for the Extra, and if a Telus customer, you get free access to the Extra with your plan. There is also T√©l√©-Qu√©bec, TFO, and TVA. The quality of shows and movies produced in Qu√©bec is on-par with many US productions.

5- The Valley East branch of the GSPL has a tonne of French language books, magazines, CDs (what are those?!), and DVDs. Reading will also help a lot. Don't be afraid if you need a dictionary either. Though francophone and attended French-language school up to, and including, post-secondary, I was English only in every way for about three years until my daughter was born. That was a wake-up call to return to my roots and I needed one for a bit when reading. I also downloaded the LaPresse+ app on tablet for their daily crosswords (not available on the mobile version).

6- Kids learn language from parents, but also TV. Kids shows are a great way to start. Again, many on DVD at the library and are trilingual for the most part.

7- Balados/baladoduffusions (podcasts)

8- Bor√©al offers courses and if employed, your employer may cover the cost.

9- Instagram had many such accounts. Feel free to DM if you'd like some or want to chat.

That's one of the reasons I like Temagami proper, +800m portages keep keeners out of the good spots. Hell even in those spots it's easy to come out of any trip with a load of garbage from people trashing sites.

The second a spot becomes widely known/easily accessible it's not 'the spot' anymore. It will degrade year over year until it's a husk of it's former self. Killarney is full of trash now because bus loads of people get dropped off to wander around the trails, it's just a park/playground to them.

Well you‚Äôll be waiting over an hour to leave, because it‚Äôs so far a lot of people will drive. Don‚Äôt forget waiting for a bus or cab. There‚Äôs surge pricing if we get Uber or other ride services. By the time you get in the cab you just want to go home. That‚Äôs exactly how I felt after a concert in Ottawa.

"Growing up, my parents always took our pets to Barrydowne. They were great, though I don't know what it's like there now.

I've been to Cambrian for an emergency vet visit. They were friendly, and really helpful.

My main vets are at Lockerby. They've gone above and beyond everytime my dog isn't well.  They're pricier, but I find they're worth it.

I brought a friend's dog into Baxter before when he was sick and she was stuck at work. They called me to go over the meds, then changed their mind on what to give him without mentioning it to me. Had I not read the paperwork and looked at the bottles when I got home, I would have overdosed the little guy based on their verbal directions. I also didn't know what to watch out for with these other meds, or to give with food or not.

Martindale is the place where I decided I never wanted to be a vet. It was my childhood dream, and without going into specifics, I left job shadowing there as a traumatized, soggy-eyed kid. Being behind the scenes was an eye-opener.  In more recent years they were supposed to biopsy a bump on a family members dog, for fear it was cancer.

"This is a complicates issue and unless you have a background in biology and are actually educated in this specific field of study, you probably shouldn't have such strong opinions. This knee jerk reaction is transphobia. 

The last I've read, after transitioning and going through hormone therapy for 3 years or so, the natural advantages disappear and their hormone levels are pretty much on par with Cis gender people.  This may or may not very depending on when the transition happens, but the study was done post puberty for sure. The one ""advantage"" left that I remember reading about was bone density. 

Some biological women have higher testosterone levels than some biological men and vise versa. I'm 6'9 and have always been naturally athletic. It's easy for me to put on muscle mass. Am I a different gender than this whiny baby on Facebook? Would he cry fowle if I lifted him over my head and tossed him? 

Now, we have always separated athletic competition by sex. This is because it's easier and on average, it kinda works. There are flaws and outliers, but its not a horrible way to group populations for the purpose of competing. But just because we have always done something a certain way, does not mean that it is the most correct way or that we should continue to do it this way. That would be felacious thinking. As I understand the argument, maybe we should be grouping people by some other metric that is even more correct and fair. Maybe by some calculation of various hormone levels and sizes to better group classes of people for athletic competition. Maybe the calculation would be different depending on what type of competition. I have no idea. I'm a laymen here. These are ideas that are only starting to be discussed and figured out now that trans rights and issues are being recognized. There will be a transitioning period as we adjust societly. I do not have the answers either. But I also guarantee that anyone screaming and crying with their knee jerk reactions to this are even less knowledgeable and informed than I am.

"One of the cons of living in Sudbury. Everywhere has their pros and cons. This is a big one for sure, but it is part of the price of spreading a population our size over a large area. Our population density means that every tax payer is responsible for a significant portion of roads (we have a population of about 165000 people to maintain 3560 lane kilometers, so roughly 21.5 km/1000 people, vs say Toronto which has about 5.2 km/1000 people) so we either have to settle for shitty roads, or really expensive roads, but we don't get relatively cheap, good roads.

"I've had an unfortunate year  with my pets (2 passed, one was very ill), so we've seen a lot of vets around town due to emergency situations. 

Our normal vet is Andrea at Barrydowne, from our experience she is AMAZING. She was the person who got us through losing a cat to FIP and a dog to old age in a 5 month span. All in all, great bedside manner and really informative. I can't recall the name of the other vet there, but on the occasions we couldn't get in with Andrea she has been very helpful as well.

Emergency vet experiences were with Walden, Chelmsford animal hospital, and Martindale. Every single one was amazing to work with and every single one worked their damnedest to get us the help we needed. Chelmsford was the one that had to break it to me that my cat was dying and the vet there treated me and my cat very well (I was a mess, I thought he just had an eye infection so it was startling news). 

Anyways, I guess my point is, in my experience so far there are a lot of really caring, skilled vets in Sudbury. So get in where you can, because it's hard to get in anywhere now from what I gather. Best of luck!

Edit to add price because I only half answered your question: If I recall correctly, without any formal tests I pay ~$170 for a checkup (I think that includes their shots as well) and for the emergency vet there is an additional fee tied to it (again can't recall exactly, but I've never paid less than $500 at the emergency vet).",t2_8losmh6f,ThatTurkeyBear,0,1648067738.0,0,t1_i1udljf,i1udljf,True,Stoic_Aurelius,t3_tl0xgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sudbury/comments/tl0xgg/best_vet_in_sudbury/,Best vet in Sudbury?,/r/Sudbury/comments/tl0xgg/best_vet_in_sudbury/i1udljf/,2,r/Sudbury,0,2

"I have some experience with this going back a few years. I was told that every street is rated on a scale from one to five, five being the most heavily trafficked streets. The more heavily traffic the street, the more quickly the city is required to repair the pothole. Unless heavily traffic areas, they have a longer grace period between the reporting time and the time when it must be fixed. If you incur damage and they are still within there a lot of time to fix the pothole, they won't do anything for you.

"What the ""people in tents"" can or can't handle isn't the topic.  The topic is people who use shelter as a means for passive investment income are literally pricing people out of shelter.   I'm talking about people who traditionally may have been able to afford a lower rent apartment but are struggling to because investors are buying these places. Flipping them (usually consisting of pretty superficial repairs) and charging a tonne more. You can try and deflect and justify however you want but the fact of the matter is you want to make a profit off jacking up people's rent.  

As far as food wholesale goes you can go google their net profits.  You'll see wholesalers on the whole did pretty flippin well in 2020. And again like with housing.  Supply chain issues usually amount to ""hey, TP is scarce so people will pay more for it. Let's jack up the price"". Companies do that generally to avoid taking a loss which over the long term is understandable.  But a lot of these companies are making pretty healthy profit. Not just breaking even.  And inflation was what around 4.5% last year?  I don't know about you but I think food, and shelter has surpassed that hand over fist. 

I work in finance so yes I do have an idea of how money works lol.   

Just call a spade a spade.  People are making money off of monopolizing necessities and are more concerned with the ROI than pricing lower class out of being able to afford said necessities. 

And mental illness is generally a result of poverty.  And I think poverty we can agree is the inability to afford necessities.  Necessities like I'm saying are being artificially inflated because some people are able to invest and make money off them.

Plenty of people on both sides get their news from alternative media outlets (outside of the corporate press). Anti anti-media rhetoric is growing because of technology, not ideology.

"> How would you feel if the bank tripled or quadrupled your mortgage because everyone else was doing it? 

They can't increased your mortgage if it's a fixed term. If you're variable, you're at the mercy of interest rate changes. It's not really comparable. 

> because ""the market"" is a shitty reason to literally contribute to pricing people into homelessness.

Pricing structure is no different if it's a hamburger or a rental unit. You have to look at what your competition is doing, and where you're priced in the market. There's a ton of variables at play (government policy, housing supply, interest rates, etc) than go into pricing housing. If you don't like the increase costs of housing, you should look into the reasons *why* it's happening in the first place.

"It's interesting to me that large chains do this. I know a lot don't. I was curious when I was first setting this up and did a lot of comparisons. I never got caught for it so it leads me to believe that skip isn't very good at following up with prices. I imagine if a customer or someone complained about it there would be huge problems. It is a violation of the contract. And you have to submit menus, which have to be faked to increase pricing. So everyone who's doing it is well aware that they can get nailed for it. 

And yeah. For customer complaints and refused orders, they will sometimes compensate you half of the order and you have to eat the rest of the cost. There is no money made on these apps on the restaurants end. The problem is they have a large market share and it gets your name out there and let's people try your food who might not otherwise. With the goal being that they actually visit your restaurant in the future.  I can't speak for fast food burger joints or places like them. They probably have much better margins than a lot of other restaurants. But for a standalone midscale restaurant which makes up most establishments in Sudbury, you run these services at a loss.

Edit: Just for background, I managed a hotel with a restaruant inside for many years. I am nolonger at that property but I was one of the first restaurants to be on Skip, then Uber and Door Dash respectively as they came to market here. I've spent more than enough time dealing with them. They have become a nessisary evil in that even if you have your own delivery service, they have such a strong market share that you are pretty much forced to work with them.

I knew you would mention something along those lines. I think most 1st world countries implemented something similar. While i also think taping parks is a bit silly i understand where it's coming from and the convoy that rolls through town is a good part of the reason why things like that is done. Unless something is enforced like a law people will not listen if its inconvenient, myself included. This is especially understandable in the early days when we weren't to sure what the virus will do. Better safe than sorry. It had to be enforced like this or it very potentially could have been much worse than it has been. As far as authoritarian actions go this would probably the best of them. I'm not even going to get started on russia. Vaccines are nothing new and they're required to go to school so why is this one such an issue for some people?

It's a perfect illustration of how they know they hold the unpopular opinion but also don't want to hold the responsibility of holding the unpopular opinion, which would involve getting downvoted

About 85% of canadas population is vaccinated which is good but not quite enough. Covid is believe it or not quite contagious so we need a higher % of the population to effectively have negative trends in infection so yes every person matters. The vaccinations aren't supposed to stop you from getting it. Rather its supposed to introduce your body to the virus to prepare it for real covid. Major symptoms are greatly reduced for an individual but on a larger scale it also mitigates the time someone can spread the virus because it is being fought off quicker than it would be without immunity. This in turn reduces the amount of infections per individual with the virus. Also new variants come from the passed one so they are related. While old vaccines won't be AS effective they should still provide some sort of immunity. The ukraine shit is to try to set your priorities straight. There's much bigger issues.,t2_br1xk6h8,IJUSTWONTBREAK17,0,1647814918.0,0,t1_i1gizc1,i1gizc1,False,Execute11,t3_tio0ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sudbury/comments/tio0ja/what_is_the_clownvoy/,What is the Clownvoy?,/r/Sudbury/comments/tio0ja/what_is_the_clownvoy/i1gizc1/,11,r/Sudbury,0,11

"> . I agree some requirements are annoying but once the vast majority of the population gets the vaccine there's not a whole lot more that can be done.

we're not getting more people vaccinated, we are at 85%+ vaccination rate. not only is that great, it also shows that the ones left unvaccinated aren't statistically relevant. even if we had 100% vaccination rate, we will still have covid in Canada. It's insane to suggest that me getting vaccinated will somehow help. That's not how it works, plus it completely ignores how the variants get here. Also, check the Ontario covid data. This current variant doesn't give a fuck about the current vaccines. So no, people are done with mandates and vaccination. Telling these people to go get vaccinated assumes their vaccination will somehow change the status quo. It won't. Vaccinated people catch covid at the SAME rate as the unvaccinated. So it doesn't matter anymore.

"Skip is horrible to both the drivers and the restaurants. They take about 25% of the food cost from the restaurant to begin with, which makes the restaurants jack up the prices of items to cover this cost. Most customers don't even realize they're actually paying more for the food. And the drivers get screwed on pay and sometimes they can't even see how much an order will pay them out until after. Skip charges the restaurant and the customer fees and delivery charges yet only a portion goes to the driver, of course they're pissed. 

I encourage people to only use Skip when necessary, like for places that don't offer their own delivery. And never order through Skip for pickup! Just call the restaurant and order through them instead of paying inflated prices just to use the app. PLUS you don't get any of the actual store specials either. And if the place offers they're own delivery service, I promise it comes out cheaper.",t2_bfpn9,perfectdrug659,0,1647731805.0,0,t1_i1c91w6,i1c91w6,True,newsaggregate,t3_thv35p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sudbury/comments/thv35p/some_skipthedishes_drivers_in_sudbury_stage/,Some SkipTheDishes drivers in Sudbury stage one-day strike,/r/Sudbury/comments/thv35p/some_skipthedishes_drivers_in_sudbury_stage/i1c91w6/,6,r/Sudbury,0,6

"The mines in Sudbury have a big problem with Wolves going into the mines at night and stealing some of the minerals and metals. They steal it and bring it to their den. Some of it falls during the travel, and the squirrels pick it up and eat it. The problem is that the squirrels pee in the rivers and the minerals they eat go into the river as well. It ends up causing a lot of problems with the water in the area, so the mines now have traps for the wolves. Once they trap a bunch of them, they have to transport them at least 100 miles away. Because of covid restrictions and social distancing, the only reasonable way to transport them is with hot air balloons. If there's an issue during this process, the sirens go off. From my understanding, the issue this morning was due to the mine losing their hot air balloon.

Compulsory vaccination will be confined to Germans alone, and the doctors in the German colonies will be there solely for the purpose of looking after the German colonists. It is stupid to thrust happiness upon people against their wishes. Dentistry, too, should remain a closed book to them.

The matter of compulsory vaccination for Germans is debateable, given the wide conscientious objections available after 1936.

"> For a guy who calls other people nazi way too much, you seem to be edging towards a form of eugenics with this comment.

LMAO you're talking to someone who doesn't guilt trip people into taking a vaccine, and wants everyone to do what *they* think is best. My body, my problem. Only a retard like yourself would ever accuse me of endorsing eugenics (ironic coming from the person who can't handle someone not being vaccinated). LTC homes need tight security and restrictions, because that age group is extremely vulnerable to COVID. But yeah, keep thinking I'm *for* eugenics rofl

"> I got the vaccine wrong, it was a mix between Moderna and pfizer. 

Nothing about 1 in 1300 in the link you provided that you are allegedly quoting from. Are you really doing that now?

In fact, lets hit the link and see whats up:

> The rate among males aged 18-24 receiving two doses of mRNA-1273 were lower than those who received BNT162b2 followed by mRNA-1273 (288.4 per million [95% CI 190.1-419.6] vs. 337.6 per million [95% CI 226.1-484.9], respectively). There were no reported events in males aged 18-24 years who received a first dose of mRNA-1273 followed by a second dose of BNT162b2; however fewer than 9,000 males in this age group received this schedule.

When you insert text(the 1300 part) that your link doesn't support, you tipped your hand bro. If you are going to outright manufacture quotes, at least put in the effort to do a basic search to make sure the number you are inserting actually shows up in the document. 

I can't help but laugh that you got caught in the same trap as Popular Break, not reading your own sources, but you actually went further and invented a conclusion. 

A truly spectacular display of intellectual dishonesty. You must think people fools to post a link and not expect them to read it. The sheer audacity. Well done. 

> Oh look, the gaslighting continues.

This is absolutely hilarious given the conduct on display above. 

It is simple logic, no vaccine mandates, equals less people vaccinated, equals more spread, and when the unvaccinated get infected they are more infectious. 

Really straightforward, and you should really account for it in your thinking, because pretending it isn't the case shows you aren't working the world that is, but some fantasy. 

> The truth is that statically speaking, someone my age isn't affected by covid very much.

Other people are, including people that you might need. Even if I concede that no one should force you, which I already have, the next question is why won't you do your part? Why does the risk have to lie solely on the weak and vulnerable. Are you not robust enough to tolerate a week of watching your heart to help tamp this pandemic down? 

> The deaths and hospitalizations were mostly old people or obese people, or people with massive health problems.

For a guy who calls other people nazi way too much, you seem to be edging towards a form of eugenics with this comment. 

> I wasn't going to sign up for something that we didn't have a lot of data on. 

That might have been the case last year, but with doses in the billions, the data is pretty solid for vaccine safety and efficacy. 

> In reality you guys just look butthurt that someone didn't swallow the entire bottle of blue pills, and that someone made an educated decision for their own health that didn't include getting vaccinated.

"> The vaccine can have side effects. So can covid. It's about measuring risk. I may never catch covid,

You are literally arguing for more risk and exposure, how do you not expect to catch covid eventually? 

> I may never catch covid, but if I get vaccinated then I immediately risk the chances of side effects.

Which are minor, and treatable, reduce your chance of infection, and decrease your viral load if you do get infected so that you are less transmissible. 

> There was a giant risk of myocarditis with younger males with the AZ vaccine (iirc). The odds of getting myocarditis was like 1 in 1200.

How does taking a 1/70000 chance of myocarditis(treatable in 6 days on average based on a few thousand patients) with at least a 10% chance of developing long covid and its associated problems?
