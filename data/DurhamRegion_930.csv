"We haven't been here too long, but a few favourites in various forms: 


* 12 Bistro in Whitby, the brewhouse place. Like, the food is exceptional for what is essentially a pub.     

* HornDawgs BBQ in Pickering. Food and portions are great, even though it's in a dingy strip mall location, love it for a take away once in a while.

* Chuuk in Pickering. Very good quality Mexican food, amazing cocktails and it's a classy place. Wouldn't be out of place in Downtown Toronto.

"You're right, I should say historically rural. Your area is west of Bowmanville Ave, while now well established, is still newer. Historically, cities that were large enough built their own distribution equipment and signed agreements to purchase power from Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, the transmission arm of which is now Hydro One. HEPCO would distribute directly to its rural customers. Typically as cities grew, annexed areas and its subdivisions would be shifted to be served by the municipal local distribution company. There was a brief period of time in the early 2000s when Hydro One bought various municipal distribution companies from cities to bolster its distribution portfolio (e.g. Brampton Hydro) as part of planned privatization attempts.

"If you live in a condo, go to the board and request inspection and repair if necessary. If it's freehold, you go with a roofer's recommendation to fix the roof. Remember, they don't need to fix your neighbour's roof, they can just do yours if they don't want to and unless there is a major shared issue, they should be able to fix your problem.

But again, if you already had a roofer there and he didn't see any external issue or recommend replacing the shingles, you probably don't need to right now. Generally, when you call a roofing company, they will send a salesperson with roofing experience so they can determine any issues as well as talk confidently and sell the repair. This is the same (generally) for any repair where you require an estimate (HVAC, roofing, major plumbing work, electrical etc). If this guy didn't try to sell you a new roof, it's probably fine externally and doesn't need repair right now.

As to how to convince your neighbour? Plan it out and manipulate them into thinking it's their good idea. A good start would be to buy some shingles, rip some up and then strategically lay them around your neighbour's yard a few days apart. Maybe wait a few weeks or when you see them again ask them if they've noticed any shingles in their yard because you have been collecting a bunch over the last little while and then go from there.

For example, when I wanted to fix a shared fence at my last house that really needed fixing, my neighbour thought it was ""fine"" and didn't want to participate. So what I did was trimmed back **ALL** the trees that provided extra coverage and was the reason he thought the fence was ""fine"". After I did this, it really laid bare how open the fence was and now his privacy was compromised (he was also on a lower elevation than my property). He changed his mind about replacing the fence within a week.",t2_wt1gg,count_frightenstein,0,1646931031.0,0,t1_i04jh5o,i04jh5o,False,frenchkiwijuicee,t3_tad9gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/durham/comments/tad9gm/can_anyone_recommend_a_good_attic_specialist_need/,Can anyone recommend a good attic specialist?

"I had a similar problem in my house. Yellow stains is likely a water stain.

Crawled up to the attic to inspect and noticed that the underside of my roof was frosted white. This means there is an excess of moisture in the attic that then freezes when temperatures get cold very quickly. Moisture stays in the attic when there is a lack of ventilation moving through the space. Once it warms up, that frosted area melts and moves down through the attic insulation onto your drywall ceiling causing the yellow stains. 

It was discovered that whoever put the insulation in my attic, spread the insulation as far as possible, covering a majority of the soffits around the edge of the roof which then prevents fresh air from entering the attic and preventing moisture buildup. A day of work (and a couple beers) later the insulation was pulled back from the edge and [baffles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Owens-Corning-Raft-R-Mate-22-1-2-in-x-4-ft-Attic-Insulation-Rafter-Baffle-Proper-Vents-10-Pieces-70RM/204848302) installed between each rafter. 

tl;dr: Not enough ventilation is causing moisture buildup which freezes then condenses.

"Well, it's good that you checked with a roofer first but really, insulation isn't that hard to do yourself. If you do call anyone, make sure you go up, maybe take some pictures, look at the insulation and if its in good condition.

&#x200B;

>there are usually two problems besides roof leaks that can cause these spots. One deals with the insulation, since cold air reaching the ceiling when the attic is poorly insulated can result in the moist air condensing on the ceiling. If this is your problem, then adding ceiling insulation, especially near the eaves, can take care of this.  
>  
>The other possible culprit could be water dripping down from the roof, though not from a leak. Moist air can get into a cold attic and form ice crystals on the underside of the roof, a problem called an ""ice dam."" On a sunny day, the roof will warm up and the higher temperature causes the ice to melt, resulting in water dripping onto the ceiling.  
>

"So you're letting one idiot's reductive opinion speak for the entire conflict? The same could be said for whatever opinions come out of Palestine, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Israel, etc.

It's not like Yemen or Palestine are ""new"" issues -- it's common for someone to be aware in some respect and figure that the fighting should end. Regarding Palestine: it's a multi-decade conflict. There needs to be some passive acceptance that the appetite for support eventually tires to a dejected ""war sucks"". If the conflict between Russia and Ukraine were to drag on for that long you'd see a similar ""return"" to apathy; Crimea, for example, left our consciousness shortly after the West declared it shocking. Yemen, for many, can often represent another conflict in Iraq/Afghanistan/the middle east at large; a country that many don't identify with that only signals ""internal matters"". That's not to say it's right, but just another unfair reduction on the conflict.

Canada has a large number of Ukrainian immigrants, and thus, will naturally have a larger voice of concern. It's hard for people to perpetually *communicate* concern over the endless pain of everyone around the world. The world's population only being able to handle a limited set of large issues at one time before it becomes overloaded and moves onto another atrocity. The closer someone identifies to an issue, the louder that response will be. It's not as simple as an issue of racism (not that it doesn't exist as it so clearly does) but a shared community -- who we identify with and as. The genocide of Uyghur Muslims, for example, was the last notable international focus.

"To compare Palestine to the blatant full scale invasion of Ukraine is reductive at best, Yemen is a tragedy, as is the ongoing bombing of Somalia. There have been large scale Pro and Anti Zionist movements in Canada, specifically in Ontario for decades.

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jdl-toronto-assault-palestinian-anti-semitic-1.6029953](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jdl-toronto-assault-palestinian-anti-semitic-1.6029953) \-- Just one example, it occurs on campuses, in the streets, and at rallies both pro and against Israeli occupation.

The reason this invasion is relevent, and is motivating a response by Canadians has multiple tiers of reasoning.

1. Many Canadian figures are of Ukranian descent, and we have a sizable eastern European minority in Canada, Namely Gretsky, Alex Trebek. etc.
2. The Russian Nuclear Arsenal, Airforce, and Naval capabilities are 100x the capability of Yemen, Saudia Arabia, Somalia, Israel, Palestine, Syria, or name the other country youd like to discuss.
3. This is the largest military deployment in European history since world war II.
4. Canada is tied to Europe in a way we will never be tied to another continent.
5. Putin is Canadas largest ""hostile"" or potentially hostile neighbour, with nuclear capabilities that reach from Ottawa, to Washington, to London, Paris. You name it.

I can go on and on. but this isnt because ""Ukrainians white, amirite?? you know those damn whiteys"".

Salt hurts paws because it dissolves into the melted water, and seeps into any tiny cracks in the paw's pad.

"Training your dog [to use dog boots](https://www.alldogboots.com/Train-Your-Dog-Wear-Boots-a/261.htm) will likely be the single best investment of your time on this. They look silly and dogs don't often love them but it does mean that you can go anywhere you and your pup please over potentially having to travel distances for your daily bathroom/exercise walk.

After trying 4 different boot types, I recommend the simple [rubber balloon-styled boots.](https://pawzdogboots.com/) They protect their feet from the salt while retaining a little bit of feeling on what they're walking on which seems to be meaningful for them. They're surprisingly durable too and I've gotten 12+ uses out of a single ""boot"". You can always try the beefy ""human-styled"" fitted boots that have velcro and whatnot but I find that these can hurt their toes and produce blisters, need to be tied on extremely tight to stay on, and don't let them feel the ground which makes the experience weirder for them.

If you're really not into the above and can't find any other plowed but not salted areas, I'd recommend walking on the shoulder of a road on local side streets/subdivisions as they typically are not salted as heavily as a sidewalk may be. The obvious downside is you're now on a road during slippery conditions and putting yourself and your little friend at risk.",t2_1026ty,YoungZM,0,1645803872.0,0,t1_hye4bvq,hye4bvq,True,bvtra,t3_t16huf,https://www.reddit.com/r/durham/comments/t16huf/places_to_walk_dogs_with_very_little_salt/,Places to walk dogs with very little salt?,/r/durham/comments/t16huf/places_to_walk_dogs_with_very_little_salt/hye4bvq/,3,r/durham,0,3

"I live in Ajax and have to drive all the way to Oshawa as that was the only Dr i could find accepting new patients.

&#x200B;

Personally, If you are happy with them it might be better to stick with him (her)?  when i tried to find a Dr i spoke with several and it was clear they only saw me as an OHIP card to swipe.

One actually told me ""i'm the one asking questions"" during our initial meeting.  WOW..  I left, i'm not going to be spoken to like that...

Trust me, finding a dr in mental health is a royal PAIN..  Canada loves to talk the talk about mental health but unless you are suicidal there is almost nothing out there and this is sad.

I inherited a couple of timepieces from my Grandpa when he passed. Neither watch was operational when I brought it to AJ.

He was able to repair one of the watches with a simple cleaning and replacement of the battery. The other watch he explained that he would have to rebuild it with a new internal mechanism and that this process would most likely cost more than the watch itself.

I appreciated his expert advice and his honesty.

"Thanks OP,

I made a post last night and then deleted it this morning.  The post last night was mostly out of frustration around how much potential this South Ajax community has compared to what I see in my community.  It is hard to be frustrated about a situation and have no audience to voice the frustrations.

I worry about Ajax High in a similar way that you do.  I agree with other posters that the Fraser scores are reflective more of socioeconomic status than the integrity of the school.  Also, I know that 25% of the students at the school are labeled as special needs.  I don't know if those folks are being tested in these provincial tests but they probably don't score the highest if they are.

I'm hoping that the rush of young families into South Ajax over the course of the last 5-10 years (and coming years) will mark a positive culture change and positive socioeconomic change for the area.  This should then spill over into Ajax High and bring about higher scoring on the provincial testing, along with more integrity for the school.

It seems like my family is in a similar place to you OP and I'm paying close attention to the school and advocating for change in this community in the meantime.",t2_bc83iha4,DelayLevel8757,0,1644673694.0,0,t1_hwn7uh2,hwn7uh2,True,ResolutionGlass2329,t3_sqf2q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/durham/comments/sqf2q8/thoughts_on_ajax_high_school/,Thoughts on Ajax High School,/r/durham/comments/sqf2q8/thoughts_on_ajax_high_school/hwn7uh2/,2,r/durham,0,2

Two went to Pickering High school.

One now has a masters in Nuclear physics (scholarship).

So the name of the chair is ""John Henry"", and I know because he addressed a local Scout Troop where my kids go 3 weeks ago on January 15 (sorry can't seem to post the screen grab I have).  The kids asked great questions about taxes, and they were answered quite well by John.

The kids in the troop are instructed in civics and what makes for good citizens in their community.  Several of the leaders are educators who are quite well versed in government.  They're taught that there are ways to make changes in your community and also choices you have to make as an adult.  Like paying taxes to live in a nice place.

Most (no all actually) people I know are happy to live in Durham.  Someone above mentioned ""Everyone seems to hate their city"".  Who are these unhappy people?  Wouldn't you leave a place you hate?

"It seems we have the same belief behind all of this, it's just not the same lens.

I don't disagree with anything you just said and yes, it does sound like a vacation. The basis of everything that I'm saying is that there has to be a rational approach to attacking reform.

Like someone previously mentioned:

>Cops are enemies of the working class and the hammer of the state. Enforcing unjust laws and not understanding the law and the rates of abuse of power both on and off the job they protect property not people.

This does more harm than good. Forgive me, I'm fully willing to admit that my use of language earlier is far too generalized in itself for such a sensitive issue. I take ownership of that and I need to be better. I don't want to express any assumption that my views are superior to others and that anyone else is wrong. It's just not constructive to make a statement like the aforementioned and to not further elaborate any just reasoning as to why they feel that way. This is the noise that gets in the way of the subject matter. Akin to the *Trucker Convoy* that's taking place right now as well.. let's not open that can of worms but we've seen how the *movement* has evolved far beyond any fundamentally perceived issues of freedom. It's noise that obstructs the primary purpose. (I acknowledge the litany of issues with the Ottawa Convoy with double standards surrounding the rights and privileges of those protesters.)

My main emphasis is that this is not an analytical/justifiable approach that would even be entertained by any form of government that's remotely open to listening to reason. Marginalized people and communities are already at a severe disadvantage and the harsh reality is that people with greater privilege need to act as a foundational support to give those people a voice, myself included. They goalposts are further back for many people.

What I mean by emotional intelligence is having the ability to draw back into the reality of how the world operates around us. The anger and frustration that many are feeling, it's absolutely warranted but we all know that two wrongs don't make a right. The pragmatism is in recognizing that anger cannot lead our decisions to provoke additional destruction and violence.

I do sincerely apologize, it's not my intent to be some overbearing asshole and truthfully, by what I previously wrote, I can easily be looked at as that way and I don't blame anyone for thinking that.

Re: Laws surrounding pay while suspended, etc.. yes. This should be amended. If anything, they should introduce a sub that either requires pay to be garnished if found guilty of offense or retroactive reimbursement if found to be cleared. Unsure if that has ever been pursued but I couldn't even fathom what that kind of debate would be like. The article below outlines that Ontario is the only province/territory left to provide this consideration.

"there are a few problems with property taxes.

\- they are not related to income.  this is why many old people cant afford homes anymore.  Property tax keeps going up year-on-year relentlessly.  Their increases often far exceed their pension incomes.

\- cities like mine (Ajax) are growing rapidly, they say they need to hike taxes to pay for new infra, but when do those new houses start paying back?  If you had a business and to ""grow"" it you kept having to spend money indefinitely, wouldn't you pull the plug at some point?

\- the services are terrible.  Like you, Ajax use to have its own private garbage contracts.  They would take almost anything you put on the curb.  Durham region muscles in, forces their waste collection on us and now we have garbage being thrown in parks because they wont take it anymore and people are assholes and wont drive it to the collection place.

Where do I need to apply any statistics/proof that contravene any arguments made here? I've pointed out that people are generalizing and it's abundantly clear that I have been quoting them.

If you want to change things, go tell the government you're unhappy and give them a reason to justify lowering taxes. My point again is that people on here are going ""ALL COPS ARE SHIT AND THEY MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY!""

I'm going to venture that every person making direct arguments have likely never worked a day in the life of a police officer (which again, I state that I do not fully support the current state of police based on my current knowledge) and make the generalized assumptions about pay and standing issues.

I fully acknowledge that many people here have different lived experiences. I've been treated very poorly by police and I am a working-class privileged male which pales in comparison to what others may face. I understand others may have different experiences that provoke biases in officers that I will never truly understand. I don't know your background and I will not make an assumption about it.

As for cuts due to COVID- there was a large increase in the cost of materials, and they continued public works (my neighbourhood has seen road repaving, water main replacement, and a new park built).

School costs have likely gone up as well because of the pandemic- making sure teachers were properly equipped for remote learning, upgrading facilities for social distancing, providing masks and tests to students, etc. And of course, the teachers are unionized and guaranteed raises(which they 100% deserve, dealing with this crap).

That probably more than offsets the reduced services at community centres(which also had to pay money to get COVID-safe).

But even if costs went down during COVID- the mpac assessments were last done in 2016, well before COVID. So costs rose during that time too.

If you look at your property taxes, the bigger problem seems to be the region (vs your city's portion).

Police services here are an absolute joke.  Want to drive highway speeds?  Blow stop signs?  Turn left when you have a red light?  Go right ahead, you have a higher chance of  wining the Lotto Super 7 vs being stopped by the police.

I've seen them stopped at a light, first car there and someone turns on the red and they did nothing about it.  Fuck, if you sit at kingston/brock you can watch the police do it too.

It is well past the point of getting rid of the dead weight in the region.  How many police do we have sitting at home, collecting FULL PAY because they committed a crime and are waiting their court dates?

we are also over-represented.  Ajax (121,000) has like 4 town counsel, 4 regional counsel, a Mayor.  Many are ""career politicians"" who are happy collecting their generous pay packages while doing as little as possible.   Email them sometime, see if they get back to you.

I think that recent moves toward truth and reconciliation are somewhat hope-inspiring and I appreciate Canada's positions on many global issues on the world stage‚Äîeven though our government enables similarly dastardly practices to the companies and governments we often criticize through our nations mining sector.

">A lot of comments in this thread reek of a very subtle type of **racism/nationalism where Canadian's expect more from immigrants** than they do themselves

Where are you getting this from? Aside from not even knowing (and personally not caring) about OP's race... the two comments, mine and another's, are simply echoing a solid point that even OPs friend has: it's taking a place of someone who might want to actually be here long term. I don't think there's anything racist or nationalist for wanting someone who takes that spot to want to actually remain here (before they even arrive and develop a different opinion). They're also showing a lack of respect for individuals, and our health and education system when they don't get the answers they like.

If someone's attempt doesn't work out or they want to be snowbirds 6 months out of the year -- they're doing things in their own way and I take no issue there. I also see nothing of wanting people to suffer (I certainly don't want that for anyone, visiting, PR, or new citizen/POC).
