"Have you checked if you need unlimited? That's probably the cause, and if you look in their online portal, it will tell you your monthly usage. Their 1200/35 plan without a contract is $100/month (https://i.imgur.com/i622oIM.png). If you pay to rent their modem and router, then that's another $15 (I think).

I have the 1200 down plan, stream, game, torrent, and work from home, and I usually peak about 900 GB/month with another roommate. Also, renting the modem is a scam. You can buy a modem/router that will be good for about 5+ years, and it will cost about $300 total (that's the price of the Comcast rental for about 2 years).

"I met my fiancé at devils slide tap house which is now Humble Sea Brewery, solid place for drinks and talking 

You could go to seahorse brewery on palmetto, it’s a toss up what is even on the menu or tap but the chaos there is fun

Pacifica Brewery is nice for a fancy date night and sea bowl is right there for something to do before or after

You could ride boyscout together but first time I did this with my girl she cried, more a more relaxed but longer ride you could go down old colma road and take old devils slide back into town and connect it with the train by ace hardware, it’s about 11/12 miles if you start at Higgins 

Best “legal” trail in Pacifica is the one past Ace hardware you can walk it all the way up to the top and overlook old devils slide, it’s a quick walk up for some great views and you end back at Linda Mar for food or just chilling on the beach

Nicks/Moonraker both have great views of the ocean, Nicks is more old school with a bar and music and moonraker is fancier in vibes

If you both golf the public course at sharp park is great and then you can get food at the clubhouse after and here the latest gossip/conspiracy theories from the bar there

Mori Point next to the golf course has some sick views at sunset, it’s a quick walk up and worth bring a couple beers to enjoy it.

You could head up Fassler and chill by the water tanks and watch the kids on dirt bikes and mountain bikes up there, bonus points if you can find the swings in the woods up there overlooking Linda mar

Speaking of swings you can go behind the Lutheran Church and look out across Linda Mar and use the swing there if it hasn’t been cut down, RIP that other rope swing

If you like hot pot there is Grand HotPot in manor 

If you want some cheap beers and to hear whatever local garage rock is playing head down to Winters tavern for a good time 

If you want a music a little more polished than winters Long Board usually has shows on the weekends, ranging from blues to reggae, surprisingly big on the inside

"Hello, I am a former member of that church, which I describe as a cult, who left over a decade ago. At our subreddit r/exiglesianicristo, we have been following developments regarding the case in Pacifica.

As a former member, one thing I can say is that they openly flaunt the law. They believe that they are the one true church and that it allows them to do anything they want. The Iglesia ni Cristo was found to have violated COVID gathering rules in Calgary.

I left that church because of their lies and spiritually abusive practices. I condemn what they are doing to your neighborhood and hope this ends soon. My advice to the people of Pacifica is stay aware, stay involved. Two words come to mind.. Clearwater, Florida.

This is lame!  It's a PUBLIC school.  I pay taxes in this town rabble rabble. 

So, I went to both today and Oceana *was* closed and Skyline WAS OPEN!!  The Skyline track was actually really nice!  Not crowded but some people and everyone seemed to be having a good time doing their thing.  The football players were doing plyometrics and there was a dad throwing baseballs with his kids on the field.  

Skyline was COLD though- colder that it is down here in Pacifica at least, so bring a jacket if you go! 

I did 2 miles and some plyo drills.  They have a cool little outdoor workout station setup with a bunch of different exercise machines and pullup bars and a dip station and stuff too.  Haven't tried those yet but maybe next time. 

Kinda proud of myself for getting to it today, tbh.  I've been a slug since the pandemic so this felt really nice.

"My take as a native Pacifican (prob outdated tho bc I haven’t lived there since 2016):

North (Manor, Fairmont): A small version of Daly City/San Bruno. Hella foggy 75% more times than LM, Vallemar, and the BOV. Slightly more Asian restaurants as well, and the population also skews more Asian/POC. 

Central (Sharp Park, Fairview, Vallemar): Burnout central, more like. Lots of hippies or New Age people, marijuana dispensaries, and just Earthy Crunchy shit. Yoga studios, hair salons, and natural grocery stores abound. 

South (Rockaway Beach, Linda Mar, Pedro Point, the BOV: When I was growing up Linda Mar and BOV was mostly blue collar white people with families. Kinda white trash, but chill. I think it’s turned into more bougie, single techies, some of which have families. BOV is def more families than LM. Pedro Point is full of rich people, and RB I think I’ve only driven down to the homes side of Fassler like three times in my whole life, and I think there’s a synagogue there.

"Pacifica resident here! It’s a great place— There are different spots depending on what you’re looking for (eg: sun, hikes, home, rental, commute) — As far as beauty that is similar to San Diego, I’d say Pacifica has the most beauty (I may be biased) and peace.

The drawback is there isn’t as much nightlife but the pro to that is its peaceful and quiet depending on where you end up. 

That specific location of the apartments you’re looking at tend to be the more windy / foggy side of town but amazing commute as you skip 2 traffic lights farther south.

"I live in Pacifica and go to SFSU. It really depends on the times you plan on going. When I did go to campus, I mostly took night classes and it would only take me 20min to get to campus. If I was going during commuting hours, it could take 30 min. The big issue is parking. On the rare occasions I would go during the day, I usually added on 20 min to find parking and get to my class, and that’s assuming you’ll pay to park in a garage and not try to get free street parking. Another alternative is figuring out Muni (public transportation). I never took it but I know there is a stop right by campus so maybe you could park off campus near a Muni stop and take it in? You could probably get more info on that from someone on r/SFSU.

"It’s not actually that cold. Or rarely is. I hang out at that beach all the time. A lot of us will gather on the sea cliff beside that complex when the whales come by, cause it’s a great whale-watching lookout. 

During the winter, and windy days, I wouldn’t go down to the beach, but it’s pretty nice. You’re a short drive from some other great beaches and views around too. 

I do think that apartment complex is a little too close to the coast, and you might be too cold -in your home-, but Pacifica is great and I think it’s worth considering. Higher up on the hill, it’s warmer and you still have easy access to the beaches. If you’re lucky enough to get a great view, you definitely won’t regret it.

There’s also more bars, nice ones, since I think that other user moved from here. It’s a fun, quiet town, super close to the city (literally just fifteen minutes from the Glen Park area). SFSU is very close. My best friend worked in Pacifica while going to SFSU—she’s the reason we’re both living here now, cause she loved the town so much during that time.

"Oceanaire is cool. I toured them before finding a private house just up the road. If you have a dog, it's a great place. There are so many dogs in the complex, and the proximity to the dog beach is awesome.

The downstairs units have carpeted bedrooms. The upstairs units are all carpet. I thought that was weird for a new place that's so pet friendly, but not much you can do. Overall though, the units are nice. They have a gas fireplace and 1 parking spot in a garage included.

As far as commute, I can tell you it's 26 minutes to SF via BART (our train) including drive to the station, and there is rarely any traffic.

The biggest change will be the weather. High is like 70, and low is like 50. We also get SUPER heavy fog at times. Overall though, it's really nice. Everyone goes to Half Moon Bay to go to the beach, so Pacifica isn't as touristy as you might expect.

Anyways, if you aren't put off by the price of the apartment, I'd definitely consider it!

"The ""cold beach"" aspect is part of the reason we moved down to the Santa Cruz area from Pacifica -- we had a place a block from the beach near the pier (similar to Ocean Aire, but a bit farther south), and we enjoyed walking the dogs up to Mori Point (it's a gorgeous walk), but couldn't stand the cold winds on the beach itself. Every time we tried to hang out on the beach, we were miserable. Technically, dogs are supposed to be on leash on all the beaches around the area, but I've never seen it enforced, and although I've read about a number of off-dog leash issues, it never bothered us (and it may be enforced occasionally). I've seen a lot of water dogs that go into the surf, but it is pretty dangerous, simply because of the weird currents and shore break (so make sure your pup is a good swimmer). We never spent any time at the beach in front of Ocean Aire, but it looked nice (we looked at those apartments and eventually decided that they were too expensive for the size, though we did like them a lot otherwise).

I would check Waze / Google Maps for the driving times to SFSU at the times you think you'll want to go to school. We went to the Mission a lot, which is a quick 15-20 minute drive with no traffic, but becomes a 45-minute mess at the wrong times. Getting to SF proper is also terrible at the wrong times (close to an hour if you hit major traffic). I think SFSU is only about 15 minutes at most times (which is great), and you'll need a car (the train from Colma isn't worth it because you need a car to get there, and it's already 5-10 minutes away. The bus would take an hour). If you want to go to SF proper, BART from Colma is a decent option.

Pacifica itself is pretty sleepy, with only one or two decent bars (Winters and ???). The food options are pretty slim, too. We went to the Mission a lot when we were there to get good food.

"Yes. If all the waves coming in are 3 feet tall looking out and you see one that is 6 feet tall, that is a sneaker wave.  You want to back up the shore. They will often break louder and further out than all the other waves in the set. Sometimes it will be two waves stacked together. Sometimes the water will go out further than it has been, leaving more exposed beach, you know something larger or a large set of waves are coming in. 

You want to look out into the oncoming surf, don't just look at the one wave coming in. It's like driving, you don't just look at the one car in front of you, you look ahead so you can better predict what is coming.

Never turn your back on the water. 

It's not like you have to watch it all the time, waves take a while to come in, just look out and evaluate the water here and there and be aware.

"I have called California Fish and Game and the Puma Project. Fish and Game won't do anything unless the animal is being aggressive, shows injury, or is a small cub without a mother. At which point, if the animal is caught they will re-locate it to another area. The problem with that is, it is likely that the re-located cat will be in the territory of another and usually the dominate cat will kill the other.

The Puma Project said the same. More information came from the Puma Project. I had a few emails and phone conversations with Zara McDonald. In her 15 years at the BAPP, she has only heard of one human attack, where a mother was defending her cubs on a hiking trail.

"I live a bit south of you in a suburban neighborhood that is far closer to the wild/urban interface.  NextDoor is filled with puma sightings all around us.  While I am more careful with the dogs, especially with access to the backyard after hours, at least one of their daily walks is during the prime dawn/dusk risky times.  I'm not too concerned walking them in the neighborhood.  We're not overly noisy, but certainly not purposefully quiet, they're harnessed.  We stay as much as possible in the more interior streets and avoid the trails.  I suspect that any big cats that may be in our vicinity are going to stay hunkered down while we pass.

My greatest concern is letting my small dogs out in the morning.  Their bladders can only last so long, and as these days get shorter and the nights get longer, we are inevitably needing to let them out in the AM while it's still not full light.  I usually go out in the yard first with a flashlight, do a quick sweep, make enough noise to make my presence known, and then let them out.

"“It does appear that it was an unfortunate accident in which a hiker had lost her footing,” Pacifica Police Department Captain Bill Glasgo said. “Very seldom are these tragic incidents happen where folks are hiking in areas, where this accident occurred.”

“Accidents do happen along the coast, but most of the time they’re not deadly, said the police captain. He’s aware of many deadly incidents that have happened over his 24 years as a member of the Pacifica Police Department, but doesn’t remember any incidents at this specific location of Mori Point.”

https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/09/07/pacifica-mori-point-cliff-fall-victim-yvonne-rogan-remembered/

“While the Golden Gate National Recreation Area manages 100 acres of land with hiking trails at Mori Point, Rogan was hiking an unofficial trail on private property, Bill Glasgo, a public information officer with the Pacifica Police Department, said. 

""The area in which this incident occurred would not be an area that we would encourage hikers to use,"" Glasgo said. ""It’s basically a cliffside that we would not recommend folks to hike.""

"> it really does seem like available places to rent are pretty limited

I lived in Pacifica for 5 years, and REALLY enjoyed it.  But my wife and I called it a ""food desert"".  :-)  In all seriousness, there were a couple of places that were good, although one of our favorites (Barolo https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-pacifica) closed while we lived there and it broke our hearts.  It is INEXPLICABLE to me how Pacifica doesn't have a single Chinese restaurant I can recommend to you with a straight face (if a local here says Kennys - yes, we ate at Kennys a couple times - no it is not good Chinese food).

The good news is that San Francisco is only 5 miles away by highway with some of the best food in the world and mind blowing variety at all price points.  We would often go up for ""date night"".  I commuted 18 miles to work every day in San Mateo, so it wasn't a big deal.  

If you aren't familiar with the weather patterns, summers in Pacifica are foggy, but the winters are often absolutely gorgeous.  Since I worked in San Mateo, a really common thing was getting up in the fog in the summer, driving towards San Mateo, and at one moment near the top of the hill the fog disappears like a curtain was drawn back and it's 85 degrees and gorgeous over on the San Mateo side.  We went for more hikes in the winter than summer.   It's right next to the ocean so the weather is temperate, meaning it doesn't ever get too cold in the winter, and is rarely too warm.

For me as a commuter, Pacifica was in an amazing location.  As I mentioned very close to San Francisco and all it offers.  Within a 25 minute drive to my work.  A beautiful drive down to Santa Cruz.  Pacifica has kind of a relaxed smaller town pace, gorgeous hiking trails where you can walk all day and rarely see others, but striking distance to intense city experiences in all directions.  Access to the beach for a walk with our dog in 5 minutes with easy parking.  Personally I've only surfed a few times but I spent hours watching surfers and find it very enjoyable/interesting to watch.  The Norcal surf shop on the beach there will rent you a surfboard, a wetsuit, and even give you lessons if you are interested: https://norcalsurfshop.com/surf-rentals/ and https://norcalsurfshop.com/surf-lessons/",t2_3m2w4,brianwski,0,1633141462.0,0,t1_hf1u3l0,hf1u3l0,False,[deleted],t3_pzdhcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pacifica/comments/pzdhcc/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Pacifica/comments/pzdhcc/deleted_by_user/hf1u3l0/,2,r/Pacifica,0,2

If being near Pacifica but not needing to be in Pacifica works for you then you can add San Bruno or Daly City to your search.

"Pacifica is not that big, but different Neighbour hoods have different vibes. It doesn’t have a ton of nightlife, but that’s the charm. It’s close enough to the everything else that you can go out somewhere else. 

If you are renting, you probably aren’t going to end up in Vallemar/rockaway or Pedro point. 

You will probably end up in Linda mar/cabrillo, sharp park or manor. Linda mar you can be near the ocean OR “back of the valley”.  Back of the valley, depending on where you are, can give you access to some hiking/mountain biking trails. 

Sharp park, which is near the pier is a nice area and has a bunch of rentals. It’s more walkable, there are some coffee shops, restaurants and shops and stuff. Also, good access to the trail that runs down the coast for biking/walking. Library and weed shop near by (depending on what you are into). 

Manor also has rentals. You have easier access to the highway. There are a bunch of apartments, but you do have to be careful. Some of them are falling into the ocean. There is also a mobile home park. No judgement, but a bunch of rentals that show up in that area are in the mobile park (or at least used to be). 

Another thing to be aware of is the traffic patterns. Because of the way schools work, people drive all over the place. I used to live in rockaway. To drive my kids to school in manor could take 20 minutes, because of the traffic at valemar. It’s worse if you are coming from Linda mar. I am sure it’s better now because of online learning, but it will get back to normal soonish.

"It’s a great place to live! Moved here three years ago for a job and have really enjoyed it.

You probably already know this, but the weather will be an adjustment. I personally love the “fall all year” vibe and the fog, but even for me the occasional two weeks straight of no sunshine can make me feel a little down. Fortunately it’s easy enough to take a day trip to somewhere with sun.

Not sure if you’re a foodie, but IMO the dining options are pretty meh. We have some local favorites, but usually end up going to the city or other parts of the Bay when we really want a special meal.

"It's not good news quite yet.  They want to turn it into a compound instead of just a church: ""New proposed plans include construction of a chapel, but also grading, driveway paving, parking spaces and multi-family housing"".  Let's all pray (snark heavily intended) that this is denied once they turn it in.

Side note, according to posts on NextDoor,  these people are shining high-powered lights into the front of the homes across the street from them at night (I saw the pictures -  I would be furious!) and calling parking reinforcement on the local neighbors when they park their cars on the side of the street the church is on - not blocking anything mind you, just on the street.  The current zoning of this property apparently states that the street is part of the property, and not public. So, the neighbors who have been parking across the street from their own homes for literally decades can no longer do so.  Real douchebags we are dealing with.

If you see a call to action about any of this, I urge to follow up in whatever way you see fit.  Between this church business and the [two huge developments](https://www.protectsanpedromountain.org/) currently proposed, I'm just sad that we are going to end up losing a bunch of the gorgeous nature we have surrounding our little town.",t2_3ofbx,EmpathyJelly,0,1632431304.0,0,t1_he0fe35,he0fe35,True,SignificantRoyal1354,t3_ptt41i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pacifica/comments/ptt41i/good_news_on_historical_horse_stables_bought_by/,Good News on Historical Horse Stables bought by Religious Cult,/r/Pacifica/comments/ptt41i/good_news_on_historical_horse_stables_bought_by/he0fe35/,5,r/Pacifica,0,5

"IMO the south end of Pacifica (Linda Mar) is a great place to learn and there are always plenty of people in the same boat who are also learning. However for a first timer, I would definitely recommend finding someone to take you out and show you the ropes. You could probably find someone through r/surfing or here in this sub. Otherwise get a quick 2hr lesson because you’ll progress a lot faster and safer that way.

You can use Nor-cal or you go through Hokali.com for lessons. If you do choose Hokali I have a code that can save you 20%. I’m about to take some intermediate lessons through them. 

For online resources, check out ‘surf simply’ on YouTube. They do a great job with their videos breaking things down.

That part of the coast as a strong “lee-shore” meaning the wind blows toward the shore. The wind is often heavy off the coat (outside of the recent storm even).

I guess my original thought about all this was that, if you donate blood to another organization, I wouldn't be surprised if they also got money for the blood along the way, at least to help cover their costs and such (like [discussed in this article](https://www.oklahoman.com/article/4985779/what-many-donors-dont-know-their-blood-is-sold)).

"I'm in no way supporting the Red Cross, I personally don't support them either. I also definitely don't agree with misleading people about selling the blood.

I still really think it's perfectly reasonable that they sell the blood, though. Even on top of all of the costs I mentioned in dealing with the blood, the Red Cross isn't a hospital, so they'll be giving the blood to hospitals, who will give the blood to people. The fact that hospital care, because of our insurance system, in general might tend to go to ""people who can afford to buy it"" isn't the Red Cross's fault. The hospitals will be charging people for the service, so why shouldn't the Red Cross charge the hospitals? Otherwise it's just the hospitals profiting.

If the Red Cross didn't charge hospitals for the blood, then by donating blood you would actually be taking away money from the Red Cross and giving more money to hospitals.

Maybe they're afraid that, if they were more open about selling the blood, people wouldn't understand why they need to do that and would donate less blood, so they avoid it.",t2_5a7ub,Cletus_awreetus,0,1630115513.0,0,t1_hamta35,hamta35,False,CommunityBayAreaHero,t3_p70p0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pacifica/comments/p70p0e/donors_needed_saint_peters_catholic_church_9521/,DONORS NEEDED- SAINT PETERS CATHOLIC CHURCH- 9/5/21 Receive a special Labor Day T-shirt!,/r/Pacifica/comments/p70p0e/donors_needed_saint_peters_catholic_church_9521/hamta35/,2,r/Pacifica,0,2
"That's what donations are for? When I donated blood through them, I was told it goes to saving lives of people in need. In reality, it goes into the bodies of people who can afford to buy it. The Red Cross even intentionally obfuscates that they sell donated blood if you look it up or ask them about it. I wouldn't have a problem if they were up front and said it was a profit center for them, but they make it seem like your donations are paid forward to others in need.

"Due to the geography of the area, there is no one centralized downtown area.  There is the Manor area in the north, then the mountain comes down to separate it from the Sharp Park area, more mountain, Vallemar, more mountain, Rockaway Beach, more mountain, then Linda Mar and Pedro Point.  Each area has some shops and restaurants.
 
There's hiking, surfing, fishing, and we even have a pretty nice bowling alley here.  There are some nice restaurants, brew pubs, and a few bars too.  Prior to covid, we had an annual festival called FogFest which was probably the biggest congregation of people in town.

"Things are, in general, going good for Pacifica. Of course, it's a matter of perspective. As a beer drinker, I am very happy with the new micro brews in town. Pre-COVID, we had a couple new breweries (like Pedro Point in Manor Plaza) and a tap room open up. The tap room (Devil's Slide, great name) didn't make it through the pandemic, but the location was bought up by brewery from Santa Cruz with a great reputation for beer. Add to that an award winning micro-distillery (Tripp's) and Pacifica is  ""a drunkard's dream if I ever did see one."" Something I am less enthusiastic about are the big building projects that are trying to get off the ground. Particularly, there's a proposed mega-church that everyone in town should oppose, due to the location and its impact on traffic and quality of life. Overall, I'd say the town is headed in the right direction, but the residents need to stay vigilant.",t2_baof3,Freeagnt,0,1627402957.0,0,t1_h6q0o0z,h6q0o0z,True,ILive2Drum,t3_osgzf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pacifica/comments/osgzf5/so_whats_been_new_in_the_last_8_or_so_years/,So what’s been new in the last 8 or so years?,/r/Pacifica/comments/osgzf5/so_whats_been_new_in_the_last_8_or_so_years/h6q0o0z/,6,r/Pacifica,0,6
"tl:Dr - Come down and visit! 

Been a resident since 2015, but grew up in Daly City so we have a bit of overlap. 

The old seavue movie theatre is now a Walgreens. Seahorse bar closed down for a couple of years but is now back open and the owner is doing daily food specials, mainly smoked meats. 
Denny's was torn down and is now a Panda Express and Starbucks. 
No plans as far as I'm away of for the Fairmont school. 
Other changes are that the Pedro point shopping center has had some great new additions (Soul Grind, Traveler, Humble Sea brewing). 
Pacifica Brewery is also running a fantastic operation next to Sea Bowl. Also Rosalind bakery has high quality baked goods and is always a treat. 
Palmetto has also be upgraded with repaving, street lights, bike lanes and has had a small revitalization with some new shops and 3 cannabis stores..lol...

To answer your last question, with the pandemic there has been a renewed appreciation of the outdoors. With the copious amounts of open space in Pacifica, our trails and beaches have never been busier than over the past year. This has obviously led to parking challenges in certain neighborhoods however it has allowed bay area folks to admire Pacifica's greatest asset, it's beauty.
 
That being said, we're still trying to upgrade our libraries, trying to get an anchor hotel/restaurant on palmetto and overall have a sustainable economy/tax base in terms of capitalizing on tourist dollars. There are only a limited number of 'nice' restaurants but there have been some turnover and some of the newer cafe's/restaurants are churning out quality meals. 

I'm sure there are things that you would notice that i havent mentioned. Plus I've tried to focus on your questions. 
You're a couple years younger than me ('85) and still live in the greater bay area, come down, spend the night with a friend or at a hotel in Rockaway and explore your home town. Don't let the feelings of the unknown get at you much longer.

"We don't really have ""downtown"" type areas. But you can walk around a bit and it's beautiful. Around Rockaway, I'd suggest Moonraker and Pacifica Brewery for food. Grape in Fog for drinks and small plates. There are a few shops at Rockaway. 

To the north, walking to Mori Point via Pacific Beach View  Park is a good time. Beyond that and you'll be in Sharp Park and there's some shops there. 

If you walk South along the beach there's the Taco Bell Cantina which is worth checking out if you haven't been. Puerto 27 has great food  and views. Further south you have some more stuff near Soul Grind. 

Of course, there's lots of beach in between all this. So bringing towel to sit on and some wipes clean your feet after walking in the sand might be helpful.

"Well, you don’t have too many options, to be honest. 
I’ll be honest, I am not sure what is open and what isn’t these days. 

If you are there in the morning, you can go to breakers for breakfast. Then, head south, and you can spend some time on the beach. When you get bored, keep heading south over the switchbacks until you get to Linda mar beach. You can hangout there, you can also keep heading south. Taco Bell has some booze drinks if you want, or you can keep heading down to the plaza. Soul Grind coffee is good for coffee/drinks and has good baked goods or lunch. If you wanted to you could book a surf lesson (would want to do it in advance) they usually meet around Taco Bell. You could also eat dinner at puerto 27 which is across the highway at crespi.

"Yeah, seriously. That stable, the empty space between Shell and Gorilla BBQ, along Roberts above Seabowl, some plots here and there, that Sun Valley strip mall on Terra Nova. I feel like forest land should be a last resort.

What really irks me is the propaganda on the Linda Mar Woods website. It's pretty thick. They are clear cutting 60 acres of trees to build 1M+ (maybe multi million) homes for a handful of affluent families. There is no balance to the stewardship of the environment, no increased equity to recreational access for the multitudes. The trailhead gate is unfriendly? Unused trails are not maintained? Here's some of the BS from the website.

*""As residents of Pacifica, we understand the importance of balancing recreational access, development and stewardship of the environment for maintaining our quality of life.""*

*""Thousands of visitors from around the region travel to Pacifica each year to enjoy the stunning beaches and mountain parks...only about 39 thousand residents are lucky enough to call Pacifica home and live in one of the six neighborhoods nestled in the beautiful coastal valley""*

*""And while this undeveloped and informal trailhead access has become an important gateway to one of the largest recreational areas in the Bay Area, in its current condition it does not reflect the world class recreational access that it provides to the more than 50 miles of trails and 20,000 acres of parklands and open space shared between Montara State Park, McNee Ranch State Park, and Sweeney Ridge State Park. The dilapidated signage, gate, and entrance way does not invite or inspire safe, positive and thoughtful recreational and natural experiences.""*

*""While many of the trails and features are meticulously maintained, many older and less ridden trail alignments and features have either been abandoned or are in rough condition. In some locations these abandoned lines and features pose risk and safety hazards with open pits, broken structures, and remnant debris.​Many of the trail alignments and features in the mid and upper area of the property are brilliantly designed to fit into the natural terrain and take advantage of the elevation and topography on the site. Dynamic step down features that provide rapid acceleration, speed and momentum feed into excellent step up features that capture and preserve that momentum to extend the descent and create more variation in the riding experience.In the lower area of the property, the existing trails converge into a steep rugged fall line trail that leads directly into the residential area and onto Higgins Way, which creates a traffic and safety hazard and promotes negative community interactions.""*",t2_97ny4tfv,Only_Context_2731,0,1626140544.0,0,t1_h4zn01s,h4zn01s,False,tailOfTheWhale,t3_ohosqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pacifica/comments/ohosqr/beginning_of_the_end_for_boyscout/,Beginning of the end for boyscout,/r/Pacifica/comments/ohosqr/beginning_of_the_end_for_boyscout/h4zn01s/,3,r/Pacifica,0,3

Try to call the dog or animal control officer for Pacifica? I’m not sure what the laws are here but I’m from NY and over there they have rules about excessive barking and they’ll actually come to the house and talk to the owners and escalate the problem if it continues to be an issue. I’m not from an HOA neighborhood or anything like that and they have very specific rules about barking/how long a dog can bark for/at what times of the day.

"We tried the habitually barking dog phone call. That was last summer when the pandemic was at its height. I didn't feel comfortable going over there to confront them directly, so I had been texting the wife (only number of theirs I had, and she had been friendly enough in the first few interactions) when the dogs barked for like 20+ minutes and I knew she was definitely home just ignoring it and it was impacting my or my wife's work. She ignored those for 3-4 months (typically once/month) straight.

Then they left the dogs alone in the backyard for an entire long weekend! Someone came once/day to check on them/feed them. But otherwise, they were completely alone all day in the back yard for 3 straight days. After we had tried speaking to them many many many times about how their dogs bark constantly and no one stops it and it really bothers us to the point we literally can't be outside when they're barking because it's so loud.

All the police did was send a cop, who came to our door, heard the barking, and was like ""wow yeah this is really bad, and they just left them alone in the yard all weekend?"". He said he couldn't do anything without them there and all he could do is ask them to be more considerate because otherwise they weren't breaking any laws since it wasn't the middle of the night.

Immediately after that interaction I sent them videos of their dogs just barking and barking and was a bit less polite and asked them how they thought it was acceptable, how they think we could possibly enjoy our house with this happening etc... It's at that point that the husband called me and was INCREDIBLY PISSED that I had called the cops. Berated me and then hung up on me.

My wife and I went next door the next day to talk to him about it once they were home. He never once apologized. He never acknowledged that it'd be annoying outside of saying ""if we knew the dog would bark this much we wouldn't have gotten him"". He made some empty promises about how they'd improve the behavior moving forward that they proceeded to do absolutely none of, and nothing ever changed.

It's not worth it at this point. If I confront them directly about any of this I'm probably just going to lose it at them at this point. The dogs are the worst part, but they are extremely inconsiderate across the board about a lot of other things too. They aren't going to change their behaviors and we're going to have to disclose it no matter what. Our realtors are very careful and know we need to disclose it.

>I have a problem with barking dogs.  
If you have a problem with a habitually barking dog in your neighborhood, call the Police Department non-emergency line at (650) 738-7314.  
The city has a program to help habitually barking dog owners and their neighbors find workable solutions that are equitable to all parties involved.  
In the meantime, begin documenting the occurences (date/time/duration) of habitual barking to aid the process of resolving the barking situation. You can also tape record barking incidences as well, being sure to state date and start/stop times on the tape.

I get that you don't want to cause any issues, but if you are going to sell, unless you bury that noise disclosure deep in the disclosures (not too hard to do in CA, truthfully...), you're going to scare away some buyers.

I would try and take care of it before selling, and perhaps you might want to stay.

"linda mar is as specific as I'll get because I'll need to sell this house and I don't want it to have a reputation for bad neighbors. We've already spoken to our realtor and we plan to disclose the neighbor noise so it's not like we're trying to slip a fast one on new owners.

I am not the type to play dirty, even with how big jerks they are I would still feel guilty about it the rest of my life. I definitely have fantasies about it, but I'd never follow through on it. I really wanted to play a recording of their dogs barking out the window during their 4th of july party but i don't want the confrontation. Leaf blowing won't bother them because they leaf blow probably 3x/week, and seem to enjoy doing it. They're obsessed with keeping their yard spotless. They have someone come by every 2 weeks to pressure wash every concrete surface on their property (typically takes about 3 hours).

And on the weekends they blast music and wash all their cars. Every weekend. Its crazy.

"If you're looking on Google Maps, its Higgins Way --> Pedro Mountain Rd  --> Optional: N Peak Access Rd. Would highly recommend you go soon, some flowers are in still in bloom. If you get down to Sun Valley Equestrian, most of the trails to the south of there are mellow. If you want to ride those specifically, you can park by Farallone View Elementary and start at Le Conte Trail.

Weiler Ranch Rd in San Pedro Valley Park is also super mellow. But riding is limited to the valley floor.

Expanding on Mori Pt, if you park at Pacifica Beach View Park - the trails by Calera Creek on the valley floor are really easy. If you're feeling a bit more adventurous, look for the cross over to the Coastal Trail - which will get to Bootleggers Steps and you can take the Coast Trail down the other way onto Old Mori Rd - which is also mellow.

"originally an eastcoaster but been in the bay for ~10 years. Lived in the city for most of the time and then 2 years in a townhouse deep in Marin. i moved to pacifica because the the access to the city is so convenient, and the commute (when that was a thing) had much less traffic than other options. The idea of being 5 minutes from the beach + access to nature is really what drew us here more than anything.

i'm dying to move away. pacifica has so much potential but in my opinion it kind of sucks. i just think it's not for us.


- firework obsession is really fucking annoying
- the F150 / dirtbike culture is annoying as hell. why are people so obsessed with their loud obnoxious vehicles?
- my neighbors directly next to us SUCK really badly, and they're sooo close to us due to the tiny lot sizes
- so many people have a ""well i can do whatever i want and if it effects other people then fuck you"" attitude (aka all 3 bullets above)
- hugely change resistant culture that's obsessed with never having anything about the town change. Someone else mentioned NextDoor really changing their impression of people around here. I have to actively stay off NextDoor because it's such a pile of garbage. It makes me sad to read the backwards opinions of the people here.


I know that none of these things are Pacifica specific. And a lot of it is that we didn't know much about what living in Pacifica was actually like before we moved here. And that we probably just need a quieter place to live. But the town is really starting to grate on us. I'm also reading ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck"" so that I can learn to let some of these things bother me less

If anyone wants to buy a house up the hill in linda mar with a great view (mountains, not water) and a really amazing back yard, we'll probably be selling at the end of the year... the neighbors suck but if you don't mind constant incredibly loud barking dogs that never get addressed despite multiple people being home who just ignore it, kids frequently screaming on a trampoline directly under your living room window, constant slamming (and i mean SLAMMING that shakes the picture frames on our walls) of their gate and front door, a pool being put in, perpetual construction, weekly gas-powered power-washing sessions that last for hours(why???), and neighbors that get pissed off at you when you very politely ask them to tone any of this down then it's a great house",t2_4feta,yanquiUXO,0,1617902524.0,0,t1_gttzh75,gttzh75,True,[deleted],t3_mknffh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pacifica/comments/mknffh/transplants_why_did_you_move_to_pacifica_and_do/,"Transplants, why did you move to Pacifica and do you ever plan to leave?",/r/Pacifica/comments/mknffh/transplants_why_did_you_move_to_pacifica_and_do/gttzh75/,2,r/Pacifica,0,2

"Not a grill, but had issues with my mower cover. 

For me, I found a long cover, where I can actually pinch the bottom of the cover under the legs of my  mower does the trick. It kind of seals the cover and keeps the wind from getting in it and blowing off. In the worst wind gusts, it will push my whole mower back a few feet, and has blown off only a few times. 98% of the time, it’s good for me. 

I imagine a long cover with a bungee or rope tie
