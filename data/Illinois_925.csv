"Look at who is proposing a similar idea : Illinois""own Lauren Underwood (Naperville)
**
 And Now, Gasoline ‘Stimulus’ Checks**

Once Congress adopts a bad idea even in an initially worthy cause, it invariably spreads to become a terrible idea. That’s the case with federal “stimulus” checks, which began as Covid relief and now are being proposed to offset the rising price of gasoline.

A trio of House Democrats—Mike Thompson (Calif.), John Larson (Conn.), and Lauren Underwood (Illinois)—have introduced the Gas Rebate Act of 2022 to send Americans a $100 check in any month this year when the national average gas price exceeds $4 a gallon. Dependents will get another $100, so the family of four can fill up that SUV on Uncle Sam’s dime. The national average price has exceeded $4 in recent weeks.

The word “rebate” is a misnomer because this isn’t rebated from any payment to the federal government. It’s a government check to pay for higher gas prices caused in large part by government. Voters are blaming Democratic policies for inflation and for making it harder to produce American oil and gas. With an election coming, and their majority in peril, Democrats are resorting to what they do best: Spending more of your money.

The non-rebate rebate is even worse policy than the gas tax holiday that some states are proposing. Neither addresses the real problem, but at least the tax holiday lets people keep their own money. The rebate idea deserves to die in the crib, but the spectacle of climate-change warriors suddenly trying to subsidize fossil-fuel consumption is almost worth it.

"This has occurred twice before. Once under a Republican governor and again under a Democratic.

Per the article, the fund was expected to close out in 2019 in the strongest year end position it had been in YEARS with nearly 2billion built up. Year end snapshots are taken at the end of year, the trust fund is typically funded each spring after businesses file taxes. 

Due to covid, the fund saw about half of what it expected (1.24bil) which got drained further as the pandemic went on and so many people lost jobs (this is not unique to IL)

IL used ARPA money to pay the outstanding debt by 1bil saving IL taxpayers from \~31mil in interest and fees.

&#x200B;

This isnt much of a story, yes IL has been in a bad fiscal position for quite some time but per the article it was about to have the most cash on hand in this fund it has seen in decades.

>Former Marine General Butler decided to play along with the conspirators to see how much they would reveal. In late 1934, he went public, sparking brief national controversy and a congressional investigation. Congress tip-toed around the scandal, declining to call any Wall Street big-shots to testify. But its final report concluded that there had been ‘an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this country’, and that ‘there is no question that these attempts were discussed and planned’ and had ‘financial backers’.


>they just weren’t going to name them. The mainstream press almost universally attacked Butler. The New York Times dismissed the whole thing as a ‘gigantic hoax’. Others hinted that the general was showing his age. He was only 53. But there was little to go on besides Butler’s accusations. The Roosevelt White House stayed mum, and the Justice Department didn’t lift a finger. Somehow a plot to overthrow the government was out of their jurisdiction.

>However, communist journalist John Spivak took Butler’s charges seriously. Spivak conjured up an even larger ‘Wall Street Fascist Conspiracy’ that roped in the Kuhn Loeb and Warburg banks, among others. Spivak’s scenario was mostly dismissed as ‘commie lunacy’ and ‘classically paranoid conspiracy theory’. The real extent of the plot remains a mystery. But, it seems Butler inconveniently lifted the veil off something that was never supposed to be discussed in public.

>things like that simply don’t happen in America. Some even suspected that FDR secretly instigated the affair to make himself look like a victim of Wall Street, as opposed to its accomplice.

>Was the Business Plot the American wing of Synarchy? Well, in 1934, the same stockbroker, Gerald MacGuire, and his boss, Grayson Murphy, visited France.

>Following actions by police and municipal officials to use force in closing various Occupy tent camps in public spaces, lawsuits have been filed, while others are being planned.[392] Civil liberties organizations filed separate law suits against the FBI for refusing to turn over documents requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regarding the FBI's role in surveillance of the Occupy movement and the FBI's sharing of intelligence about Occupy events with private corporate security officials.[393] The FBI withheld documents requested under the FOIA citing the reason that the withholding was ""in the interest of national defense or foreign policy"".[393]

>in 2013, MIT doctoral student Ryan Shapiro, collecting research on the role of the FBI in the Occupy movement, sent the FBI three FOIA requests regarding

"Ok, we started this conversation on tax fraud and media bias, and you've strayed into who knows what you're talking about now.  How on earth do you think Jesus was convenient for those in charge?

But I do agree with you on two things: Too Big To Fail is/was a stupid idea.  And if you keep talking too far down that trail, you'll come across even more like a raving loon. 

One last side note: I never said the federal reserve was related to income inequality.  Rather, the Federal reserve is responsible for inflation.  There's arguments to be made that income inequality isn't as ""bad"" as it seems -- not that it's not as big as it seems, but rather that in the presence of income inequality, all boats have been lifted (see my prior comments about cheap technology).

If one wants to build anything whatsoever in Chicago apart from an in-kind replacement of the same building, a zoning change is needed. Zoning is so granular you could never legally use a piece of property for any different use without a zoning change. 

The only way you'll get a zoning change is to bribe the alderman of the ward. Of course they don't do it via stuffed-envelope cash bribes anymore since it's too easy for them to get caught that way.

"In my mind, it seems like a tough sell to find someone, or some company willing to build an apartment complex and maintain it in 2022. There are plenty of property management companies in Chicago, but I honestly don't know where the money to build new apartments might come from. I'd imagine the payback period on apartments is decades, but I haven't gone through any exercises of that sort. I think I'd be generally against the city undertaking construction, but I might expect them to push for those types of buildings and offer some form of incentive.

Two and three flat apartments, as well as larger rental complexes, should be completely legal to start with, however. At this point, when something comes down, it's either condominiums or SFH, which is ridiculous for a city. Yes, condos may be as affordable as rental properties in the long run, but owning just isn't a reality for many people. Edit: No one should have to pull out a loan and PMI just to exist.

">Why has housing, internet, education, and basic goods and services increased exponentially over 20 years

Internet is an interesting choice there.  About 20 years ago, it'd cost $20 for dialup, and another $20+ for the phone line it ran on.  Right now I'm paying $35 for internet that's hundreds or thousands of times faster than the fastest dialup ever was.  The same can be said for a lot of technological goods and services.  If went to buy a computer/phone with the power of one from 20 years ago, it would be crazy cheap compared to 20 years ago.

I realize that's a tangent (as is most of this thread), and certainly inflation exists, and is increasing a lot in the last year or so, but I'm not sure what that has to do with media bias and people with a history of tax fraud running for office (where this started).  Stocks only cost people ""their entire life's work"" if you sold everything at the very bottom.  In 2009, as in 2020, any losses in broad market funds were regained within a year or two.  2001 was worse.  But again, not seeing that related to media bias.

The culture war is perhaps more related to media bias, but is also where you'll find the most left-leaning commentary on most corporate media.  You certainly won't see CNN promoting prolifers or standing for traditional marriage - they went out of their way to defame a prolife teenager in DC who smiled when he was taunted by a Native American beating a drum.  Most media plays down ""antifa"" burning down cities - remember the ""mostly peaceful protests""?  Most people just saw through that BS - that is, whether it's BLM, or Antifa, or other agitators, there was a lot of violence involved, even if there were also many peaceful protests/protestors.  But hey, thank goodness we shut down all the small businesses for months while amazon and walmart took over mail-order retail for us.  That wasn't ""right-wing"" propaganda asking for local businesses to shutdown, but it \*was\* all over television and radio.  That said, I avoid a lot of mainstream sources, and look at everything with some degree of skepticism -- but there were so many times when the ""bad"" things that Trump did were exaggerated if not completely falsified, once you look at the actual details (yes, he spouted stupid crap on twitter all the time, but no, he never said nazis were fine people - the reason Biden brought up in the debates for launching his campaign).

Ofc they were correct about that but it really suited them to benefit financially knowing it wouldnt be reversed and ofc.. obama black, obama bad, so they won twice. Now... Trump did the very same thing as one of his first acts as potus iirc now the majority ownership is 70% and diluted the dollar value yet again. This time though it was not an issue and here we are 5-6 years later with the national debt the highest its ever been and ""riding thd bubble"" again trying to deal with it.

"Do you not see it? Like you legit think the attack on Biden by CNN and other “left-wing” channels after his withdrawal from Afghanistan, a deal that the previous administration brokered with the Taliban directly, legitimizing a terrorist organization as a governing body and giving them 5,000 captured combatants in exchange for nothing. You don’t think that’s right wing military industrial complex action?


Or shall we talk about the fact that they constantly ran stories repeating Trumps name over and over and over and over in the run up to 2016 election. 

He got days worth of free exposure from “left wing”. Corporations don’t want any leftist ideas permeating their channels. Because as soon as the common man realizes they are getting fucked and decide to take action then they are doomed. 

Hence why they have you fighting a “culture war” while they are waging a class war. The largest form of theft is wage theft by employers but the news plays stories about the “scary Antifa” burning down buildings. How about these banks that are burning down people’s savings. All systems in the US are designed to funnel money to the wealthy. 

See: 401k which is private equity investment has higher returns than banks. If you store money in a bank you actually lose value because of corporate profiteering and inflation. But buying stocks is a gamble and has cost people their entire life’s work during the last bust. And we have no social safety nets because corpos buy our politicians to ensure they never have to pay fair wages.

"Pritzker paid his taxes later and squared up after he was alerted to the situation. Also the toilet removal wasnt just for 'tax fraud' they were removed so nobody could start 'squatting' there which could have potentially kept the demolition of the house in deadlock. Remember those 2 'scared white people' that the husband pointed an AR-15 and his wife aiming a handgun at BLM protestors the media made a big deal of? Well, 'their precious home'they were ""defending"" wasn't owned by them at all. They are the ""wealthy version"" of squatters and were using squatters rights laws to try to gain ownership of that house by moving into it when it was empty. The same type of priveliged, educated assholes would have likely tried to do the same if the house had not been stripped of the plumbing.

"Your understanding is incorrect.   


I've spoken on this before, but the key to Madigan's power wasn't the Speakership, it was being the Chair of the Democratic Party of Illinois.  This meant he controlled the collective fundraising of the state.  That put him into a position where no one was allowed to step out of line in any fashion, for fear of either being primaried by a more acceptable candidate (if it was a Democratic strong district) or just having money withheld to allow the Republican to win (in a more battleground district).  This meant the entire party of the state was Madigan's way or end of career.   


Now the Speaker and the Chair are separate individuals. Not only that, but the caucus as a whole has pretty much all agreed that they would never allow one person to be in both positions again.

"I follow the Lake County Treasurer Holly Kim and she gives a lot of great insight into things like this.  I can't find the exact post, but the required signatures for her position was somewhere around 600-650.  Her goal was 2,000 signatures.    


Think about that, it's such an expectation that signatures can be tossed out so easily that the goal is to get triple the amount actually required.  I've heard that if you get less than double that leaves you very open to a challenge that can leave you off the ballot.  Like property tax lawyers making a killing with decades of Madigan (a property tax lawyer), election lawyers make a killing in this state with how things are setup.

">You do realize how ironic your statement is about fear? What do you think your 'death of the planet' comment is exactly?

To entertain climate change on the same standing as propaganda by the GOP is a telling point about the effects of fear mongering. The largest outlets of right wing misinformation with climate change, renewable energies, and public health are all funded by the fossil fuel industry, and all of the GOP are dogs on a leash to come out swinging, not for the defense of fossil fuel(though some do) but rather to sow distrust in the solutions to wean us off what is very much killing the planet. 

>""There is broad scientific consensus that Earth's climate is warming rapidly and at an accelerating rate. Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, are very likely (>90% probability) to be the main cause of this warming
AAP, 2007

>Over both historical (1880–2015) and recent (1965–2015) time periods, more than half of the global surface ocean acidification is attributable to the CO2 emissions traced to the extraction, refining and combustion of fossil fuels and manufacturing of cement from the 88 largest carbon producers.
IOP, 2019

>90% chance of at least 1 year between 2021-2025 being warmest on record and about 40% chance of annual average global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5°C above pre-industrial level in at least one of the next 5 years.
WMO, 2021

Our use of fossil fuels is rapidly accelerating the destruction of the planet itself, with potential catastrophic results if the use of fossil fuels is not scaled back. There are some things that are already unavoidable that we will have to prep for, like more extreme weather and destabilized climates, and resulting immigration as climate change forces people to flee uninhabitable environments. 

The cause of all this? mass short term profit in a consumerist world of many things we don't need at all. We've maximized convenience and objects we don't need, capital and wealth to a degree no human should ever need to possess, in favor for what, to doom the future of humanity so we got to live in a time where we get to read about billionaires just getting to do whatever they wanted? 

COVID has shown us that some people can't even manage their lives without the consumerism that has become a part of their identity, which was manipulated into more propaganda by the GOP, in worthless culture war nonsense and customer service workers ended up receiving the blunt of it, and again, for what exactly, two day delivery options? useless gadgets that you already own three other things that preform the same function? Another Doller General, Subway, and Caseys built in some Southern Illinois town?

"Never said execs aren't greedy - but to ignore the fact that oil has gone from under $70 to over $100, and that for example, BP is not any where close to 'record earnings'. They still have not made up for their 2020 losses. This quarter is yet to be soon, but they haven't been raking in huge profits as oil has gone up in price. 

You're ignoring a lot of what I said, and you're as biased as the people you're arguing against. There is plenty of corruption and incentives all over the place, and plenty of greed. That doesn't change the fact that the price of oil being directly correlated to the price at the pump, with a few weeks/month of a lag. 

> GOP just happen to want to gaslight you with hate and fear while working for corporations that are causing the death of the planet.

You do realize how ironic your statement is about fear? What do you think your 'death of the planet' comment is exactly? 

The only thing you've said here is, ""Oil corporations are greedy and politicians get paid by them"". Wow. Genius. Doesn't change what I said, which is that there are plenty of legitimate criticisms of Biden to be made. Things that he has done and hasn't done that has led to a lower oil/gas supply. Dems are so focused on renewable energy yet at the same time can't admit how far we are away from renewable energy (with or without more gov't money). Germany wanted so hard to be the green leader that they outsourced their energy needs to Russia, and possibly are the most responsible country for this entire conflict. 

Republicans in bed with oil companies (and many Dems), but Dems have become beholden to moronic and devastatingly awful policies that fly in the face of our energy needs. 

Energy independence > renewable energy. 

But Dems want to please the AOCs of the world, so they can't get their heads out of their asses and drill like fucking crazy for a few years while we spend the next 5-10 years moving to renewable energies. 

As for the corporations not growing - when that cost of growth is too high - or takes too long to ramp up - then no, they can't grow. You have to buy a plot of land and then sit on it for 2 years, in hopes that the government eventually approves it - that's not financially feasible. And if those corporations new the demand would be higher (if USA imported less and exported more to a large extent), they would feel confident in investing more in production. 

Even Musk says we need more carbon based energy in the short term. Getting cars electric will take another 5-10 years. Then we need solar to ramp up as well - and also to be able to have batteries to store that solar energy. But all those batteries are going into cars. **This takes time**, and divesting from domestic oil, and relying on someone like Venezuela isn't going to help a damn thing except empower countries we don't want to empower. Literally won't help a damn for climate change or the movement to renewable energies.",t2_j6hjj,grizzly_teddy,1,1647884442.0,0,t1_i1k0v0t,i1k0v0t,False,LeBurntToast,t3_tiqfnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/illinois/comments/tiqfnr/how_does_governor_pritzker_hurt_sma_businesses/,How does Governor Pritzker hurt sma businesses?,/r/illinois/comments/tiqfnr/how_does_governor_pritzker_hurt_sma_businesses/i1k0v0t/,0,r/illinois,0,0

">As demand for oil has resurged from its mid-2020 lows, producers have been under pressure from shareholders to “put profits over production increases” and “return cash to shareholders rather than pump it back into drilling,” to quote the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal, respectively. As a result, companies have only expanded production slowly.

>Just listen to oil executives themselves. “Whether it’s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we’re not going to change our growth plans,” the CEO of Pioneer, which is the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, the key oil-producing area of the Southwest, said at a Bloomberg event last month. “If the president wants us to grow, I just don’t think the industry can grow anyway.”

Biden and the Democratic party receive funds from mega-cops so they'll never change it while they're in power because it's an across the board practice and neoliberalism is a disease both parties share a love of basking in for various entities.

Do you think that when you voted for corrupt idiot of a politician that has a 30 year history of being a war monger and a racist do you think that was a good decision? Do you think that that election went fairly? You don’t think that there was some voter fraud? From what I understand they didn’t even have people show their IDs before they vote.

"I think first and foremost the state needs to prove itself to be trustworthy to the tax base again. A Progressive Tax isn’t necessarily Progressive in a political sense, plenty of Red states have such a system, and there is fierce debate over which tax system is better. 

What Illinoisans object to, however, is state leadership that continually comes to the tax base for more money while refusing to cut a dime of public spending. One of the major things this state needs is Pension Reform, which would require a constitutional amendment removing constitutionally guaranteed pensions. For decades the people of Illinois were told that such an amendment would be going too far, which is why an amendment to change the tax system instead was seen as disingenuous by many long time residents. 

If Illinois was to get serious about financial reform by cutting spending, implementing pension reform, paying off debt, etc., and the state government wanted to shift some of the rebuilding fees onto wealthier residents with a progressive tax, then sure we could take another look with the necessary guardrails (hopefully they’d make it a bipartisan measure rather than trying to ram it through on partisan lines again).

"I’m just saying, the kinds of people who say the economy doesn’t matter are the kinds of people who don’t have much skin in the game to begin with.

You’re never going to vaccinate the entire world, even the eradication of smallpox was done with targeted injections rather than broad vaccinations. It’s not worth worrying about whether or not your neighbor has the vaccine when we’ll be seeing new variants from the 3rd world for years to come. What’s important is the protection you can provide yourself. 

Things can “work” but be unnecessary. For example, lifejackets work to save people from drowning. However, if I’m a strong swimmer in a shallow lake, I might decide a life jacket is unnecessary. All a law forcing people to wear life jackets would do is make my life more difficult to live. Masks are the same way. If you’re a weak swimmer, put on a life jacket. If you’re vulnerable or scared, put on an N95. Just don’t tell me what I need to do with my own safety.

"No need to sling accusations. I'm an educator. Has not been easy either.        

Vaccines don't make you incapable of contracting the virus, they only makes you more capable of fighting it off. What most people forget from JH science is that vaccinated people can still transmit the disease.    

You asked ""What does someone else’s vaccination status have to do with the personal protection provided by a vaccine?""    

A good question. If you've got a line of 10 people and only 1 person is vaccinated, the virus will travel to all 10 and only the vaccinated person is nearly guaranteed not to die. If the same line has 3 vaccinated people randomly placed, likely the same outcome but with 3 nearly certain not to die. Same line but the first 5 are vaccinated, the virus is likely to be fought off before reaching person 6, to but no guarantees. If you've got the first 9 people vaccinated it's almost certain that the virus will not survive to the last person.     

In terms of old school warfare, think the archers and catapults being used before sending in infantry.    

Those 10 people are your customers.     

People don't stand in lines, we're all over the place all the time so the more people are vaccinated, the greater likelihood the economy gets back to normal quickly.     

The reality is that people were duped into believing nonsense and propaganda that prevented people from looking out for each other. We know masks and vaccines work but people refused common knowledge and science for what they read on FB. At that point what other option is there but to shut down the economy if the people are refusing to take care of themselves and look after their neighbors?

"Gas was going up and up before Russia invaded Ukraine, and that was closely related to the price of oil, so I'm not sure how you chalk that up to greed. 

And Biden *is* to blame indirectly, for not doing anything that could have prevented the Russian invasion. Biden gave Putin a green light to invade easter Ukraine. Biden's withdrawal in Afghan showed a lot of weakness and Biden's general attitude of avoiding  armed conflict. Pundits 6 months ago were saying Bidens actions in Afghanistan were a signal for Putin to invade Ukraine. The rate of approval of drilling, and ending leasing of federal land, and general anti-oil policies certainly have contributed to the US having less of a supply than it would have had under a right wing President.

I'm not saying you can know for sure that prices wouldn't be high with a Republican president, but there is plenty of blame to be put on Biden here. 

There are certainly ignorant Republicans who just ""Democrat = bad"" the whole thing and don't really think about it much - but there is much to be said for Biden's absolutely terrible policies that at best have made an existing gas supply issue worse than it had to be.

"1. I’ll accept that congress could be conflated with local action.

2. I’m actually not nitpicking. I don’t think you understand what mortality rate is. Lockdowns aren’t supposed to affect mortality rate. “Did lockdowns do anything to curb the number of people who died from the pandemic?” is a completely different question/statistic from mortality rate. 

Here’s an example: Say COVID has a mortality rate of 1%. With no lockdown, say there’s 100,000 people infected, and 1000 will die. With a lockdown, say 70,000 people are infected but 700 still die because lockdowns don’t inherently improve your health. The mortality rate is still 1%. However, despite the mortality rate staying the same a theoretical 300 lives are saved. That is how mortality rate works and lockdowns don’t make people more likely to survive COVID, just less likely to get it.

3. How to you ensure self identification is accurate? Where are we housing all of these people? Who would volunteer to be exposed to others during a pandemic? Your solution doesn’t take any of these into account.

"> What did Congress even do for COVID?

True, most of the policy was on the ground level. My guess is the people polled conflated most federal policy with Congress? Maybe elected official's positions as well? Let's not forget many of these people were very influential in drafting state policy. That being said, it's simply a public perception poll.

> lockdowns and mortality aren’t that connected.

You're nitpicking. The question was, ""Did lockdowns do anything to curb the number of people who died from the pandemic?"". The answer is slightly, but arguably not enough to justify the policy. 

> Also, your idea about sequestering vulnerable people makes zero sense. How do you decide who’s vulnerable?

As I said earlier, self-identification. You provide people with the information and let them make the choice from there. Most people who were at risk knew they were at risk due to the presence of one or more co-morbidities. 

> Do you separate them from their families? 

Yes? Unless the families wanted to be sequestered along side the vulnerable person. Hospitals weren't allowing families to see patients, so it really isn't that much of a departure from what actually happened. 

> Who is this supply network made of?

Probably careworkers and volunteers on the State/Federal Payroll. The trick is to make it lucrative enough such that it is an attractive position, which is where dedicated funding would've helped. 

> and is wearing a mask such a big deal to you that you compare it to a cancer ward?

Uh yeah, given most people have to wear masks in cancer wards on account of the people with cancer. The mask mandates went on far too long, and reinstating them was an insult to the population that had abided by them for so long. By year 2 mask mandates had become security theater, something that existed solely to make people feel safe.

Edit: I need to state that masks do work so that the Sub Mods don't ban me again.

The Progressive Tax was a **Constitutional Amendment** that gave Springfield the ability to levy a multi-leveled “Progressive” tax. Such things such as tax brackets and tax rates were solely at the discretion of the legislature.  Springfield laid out some sample rates they wanted to implement, but it was very  apparent that they were using sweetheart rates to entice people into changing the tax structure, with no guarantee how long those rates would last. And when the rates did change, the taxpayer could do diddly squat because, again, **it was a constitutional amendment**.

"Look it’s been a while since I’ve had to think about the progressive tax with any level of detail (thank god), but one of the criticisms of the measure was that the legislature had unlimited power to both define tax brackets and to set the tax rates, with no oversight whatsoever. One of the biggest arguments in favor of the measure, the lower tax rates for a majority of Illinoisans, falls apart when you realize that those tax rates could be changed at literally any time, with no input from the voter base. Further more, what this would’ve allowed was the ability to overtax specific tax brackets while suffering little to no blow back at the polls. You could drown 45% of the state in taxes while remaining ingratiated with the remaining 55%. Illinoisans were not cool with the state government having this power, so they killed the measure.

The aid was completely unfair and often went to those that didn't need it. I worked for a company that stayed operating during the entire lockdown because it was an essential business. I was talking to the CFO asking about PPP, and he mentioned we secured the forgivable loan. Close to $10 Million in handouts, and as soon as the no-layoff period ended, they laid off a bunch of marketing employees despite getting government aid.

"It really depends on the type of business you want to open. Gas stations managed to bully the US government into destroying Standard Oil back in the day because they were offering lower prices nationwide and driving down costs to consumers because they were a monopoly. Breaking them up led to price increases for consumers but also more small businesses so that a slightly larger pool of rich people could share in the profits.

And that's really where we are today. Businesses have consolidated and its no longer economical to compete with them. Heck, 10 years ago, you could earn $3-5K per simple website you made for a small business plus monthly hosting fees. These days, small businesses just go to Squarespace and hire their nephew or niece or take photos and make a website for them for like $200-500 in beer money. And the hosting is cheaper too.

So what does that leave? Well, government contractors. Except the market in general is pretty saturated so if you're not a minority, a veteran, disabled, or a woman, you might as well not even bother trying because you will probably not get any money. But if you are any one of those, you can apply for SBIR and build up a business that will most likely fail, but might not, using money straight from the US government with relatively low risk to yourself.",t2_8w7xe,hardolaf,0,1647805830.0,0,t1_i1fxmcz,i1fxmcz,False,LeBurntToast,t3_tiqfnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/illinois/comments/tiqfnr/how_does_governor_pritzker_hurt_sma_businesses/,How does Governor Pritzker hurt sma businesses?,/r/illinois/comments/tiqfnr/how_does_governor_pritzker_hurt_sma_businesses/i1fxmcz/,2,r/illinois,0,2

"I’ve looked into opening a small business and… I don’t know how people do it without having a fuck ton of money to start with. The cost for a property are insane - lease or buy, it doesn’t matter. In order to afford the damn location, money has to come from somewhere else - and often it’s the employee wages. 

I’ve run the numbers a few times and it’s just impossible to pay the bills and employees. People are so damn flippant when they say ok fine, you don’t deserve a business. But when you price out the little guys, who is left? The fucking rich bastards who STILL pay jack shit.

In my area, the small time businesses who are thriving are the ones who’ve been in business for 20+ years because they have their own buildings. They aren’t at the mercy of this insane market so they can afford their overhead and wages. Whether or not they choose to is another story, of course. But I’ve watched a number of new business pop up and collapse because they just can’t do it. The main business areas are filled with a handful of really old established small business, dozens of chains and corporations, or empty buildings/spaces that no one can afford. It sucks.

I was trying to make a joke.   But I think that it's pretty bad on low level corruption.   Aldermen have been convicted for taking as little as $1500 in bribery cases.   They can be bought pretty cheaply considering.  Too much power is given to them in zoning and permits which leads to outright bribes and the overall culture of pay to play in getting campaign contributions and steering work to their own legal firms.,t2_f4p63,midwaygardens,0,1647681044.0,0,t1_i19fum5,i19fum5,False,WindyCityAssasin2,t3_thk1zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/illinois/comments/thk1zt/what_are_some_good_things_about_illinois/,What are some GOOD things about Illinois?,/r/illinois/comments/thk1zt/what_are_some_good_things_about_illinois/i19fum5/,1,r/illinois,0,1

"We have one of the best cities in the world with amazing history, culture, food, music, nightlife, and sports. Good location in the middle of the country - easy train and plane access to the rest of the country/world. Lake Michigan. Beautiful nature outside the city (it may not be mountains but it is some of the most lush and fertile land in the world). We feed the country (and have the best corn). Friendly, down to earth people (even in Chicago, which is rare for a big city). Legal weed. Great beer. Abe Lincoln. Obama. 4 seasons and decent weather most of the year (and the terrible winters make us enjoy the rest of the year that much more). Good universities, schools, and hospitals. We use the Oxford comma. Beautiful architecture. Nice neighboring states (besides Indiana). People actually have a sense of humor and can take a joke. 

Sure, there are plenty of negatives too (crime, taxes, corruption/politics, winters, etc.), but I think the good far outweighs the bad! I live in the Netherlands now but I don’t think I would live anywhere else in the US but Chicago.
