"Put to death? No. Penalized for paying zero attention to the road? Yes. Again, it’s **bright green** at car intersection points. Including parking garages. And the median is elevated and has giant white bollards sticking out.

As a frequent cyclist, I find this so disturbing. People should be able to travel in an efficient, healthy, low footprint, and environmentally friendly way, *in a gold-standard designated protected road space*, without having to worry about idiots in cars turning into them. It keeps more people cycling, cyclists safer, pedestrians safer because cyclists don’t feel that they have to use the sidewalk, and traffic flowing more smoothly. 

I don’t care if you’re a senior citizen and not used to it. Get with the program or surrender your license.

Are we forgetting that the planet is dying? Cars should not be the default mode of transportation anywhere, especially in the middle of downtown; they should be reserved for long distances, dangerous weather, and people with disabilities. 

I’m sorry everyone got used to driving everywhere and driving downtown and being the kings of the road, but that’s hardly my fault. 

If I had my way, there wouldn’t be any roads in between Hill/Packard/1st/Huron/Washtenaw; that’s about an 0.75 square mile area. People with disabilities can use those little motorized scooters or bloody golf carts capped at 10-15 mph, rented on the outskirts or subsidized by the government with the vast amount of money we currently use on road maintenance, and everyone else can walk/bike/scooter.

"Can't understate this.

1) Make the police work for you. We pay them for this kind of thing through taxes, so, you know, let's actually put them to good use.

"> If you can't drive without hitting inanimate objects, take an uber, people.

This is part of why we need better pedestrian/bike infrastructure and better public transit. (Not to mention denser construction so walking/biking/transit is more feasible for more people.) We currently have a situation where so many people are forced to drive even if they don't want to, can't really afford to, or know that they're a hazard on the roads.

BREAKING: Local Community Members Lockdown Equipment to Stop Deforestation at Proposed Luxury Housing Development


This morning at approximately 6:30 AM, a local forest defender locked themselves to a large mulcher on the site of the proposed Concord Pines Development at 660 Earhart Rd, bringing tree-clearing to a halt.  They were soon joined by a nearby group of supporters, who, after an Indigenous-led land acknowledgement, shouted, and waved signs. This action comes after months of inaction on the part of local government to address community concerns and delay the project. Today, community members organized under the name FIGHT Concord Pines  say they are taking a stand on behalf of the trees and people of tree-town. 

""I'm doing this because the people of Washtenaw County deserve affordable housing, not more homes for rich people.” said the community member identifying themself as Osprey, as they stood locked to the mulcher. “Ann Arbor is one of the most economically segregated cities in the country, yet somehow people like Toll Brothers think that we still need luxury homes instead of affordable housing. We have done all of the legal things we can to stop this development from happening, and time and time again City Council has said their hands are tied. I grew up here; I know the birds, the frogs, the salamanders like the back of my hand. I'm not going to stand by and let these beautiful old trees be destroyed for luxury homes without doing what I can to stop it.""

The Concord Pines development, proposed by nationwide luxury homebuilders Toll Brothers, would see the construction of 57 luxury homes on the remains of 39 acres of mixed second-growth woodland north of the Concordia College baseball diamond. Toll Brothers have recently built several luxury condominium developments on the north side of Ann Arbor near Dhu Varren and Nixon. In order to build these new luxury houses Toll Brothers will clear approximately 70% of the landmark trees and 60% of the low-level woodland trees from one of the largest remaining parcels of undeveloped land within the ring of freeways surrounding Ann Arbor. 

This development stands starkly against a background of ongoing local and global crisis. On a local level, Ann Arbor is facing an affordability crisis. A lack of new affordable housing, increasing market-rate rent, and a yearly increase in workers and students at the University of Michigan with no added housing, combined with 10 years of rising income inequality have precipitated this crisis, making Ann Arbor a place only the increasingly wealthy can afford to live. Workers are forced to move out of Ann Arbor, often to Ypsilanti where they inadvertently drive up rent prices and displace more people. Those who cannot afford to rent anywhere near where they work are pushed into homelessness, staying at the overcrowded and underfunded Delonis shelter, or camping out of sight. 

On a global and soon-to-be-local scale, we face a climate crisis and a biodiversity crisis. The causes of these crises are by now well understood, and studied at the prestigious University of Michigan. The burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of forests contribute to both, and there is a vanishingly slim window left to stop these causes and prevent catastrophic outcomes. 

The proposed Concord Pines development is an example of the kind of low-density, energy-intensive, cost-prohibitive housing that Ann Arbor can literally no longer afford – not if it wants to leave intact ecosystems and communities for future generations’ health and wellbeing.",t2_pyaa4,the-use-of-force,0,1648222117.0,0,t1_i22qlo3,i22qlo3,True,the-use-of-force,t3_tnoc1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/tnoc1u/protest_at_that_development_on_earhart_road_this/,protest at that development on Earhart Road this morning,/r/AnnArbor/comments/tnoc1u/protest_at_that_development_on_earhart_road_this/i22qlo3/,62,r/AnnArbor,0,62

What they need to do is just get a cheap old trainset and work out a deal with Amtrak to give permission for a local authority to run it on the existing passenger rail tracks between Ypsi and A2. Build a platform in Depot Town for the Ypsi terminus and use the existing A2 Amtrak station for the A2 terminus. Run this thing back and forth all day at the quickest possible interval and just pull into a siding for the few minutes a day that the Amtrak comes through. Boom. Separated grade transit downtown to downtown on mostly existing facilities. I would use the heck out of this.

"Upon researching I have found that the Monroe street fair has the following rules in place:

>at Monroe Street Fair:  
>  
>Commercial (non-political) vending included. No food vendors. No city permits or insurance required! Monroe Street Fair's permit mandated liability insurance does not cover or protect vendors. Email Monroe Street Fair at [monroestreetfair@gmail.com](mailto:monroestreetfair@gmail.com) or [vending@monroestreetfair.com](mailto:vending@monroestreetfair.com).  
>  
>on Ann Arbor City Streets and Sidewalks:  
>  
>As part of Monroe Street Fair's permit approval, Ann Arbor City Council has suspended vending permits within 2 blocks of the Diag during Hash Bash. Ann Arbor City Council has made no exception for 1st Amendment protected sales and solicitations of donations, books, magazines, videos, recordings and other items bearing messages. Vendors ignoring the ban risk certain tickets and seizure of their property by Ann Arbor police. Local courts dismiss tickets and return seized 1st Amendment protected items after vendors return for a court hearing weeks later. Only vendors who have been ticketed and/or their 1st Amendment protected items seized have standing in court to request a restraining order on police during future Hash Bashes. Vendors with standing may request assistance from Washtenaw County American Civil Liberties Union.  
>  
>on Diag  
>  
>The University of Michigan has steadfastly refused to allow any sales or solicitations, including 1st Amendment protected activity, on or near the Diag, except for University recognized organizations. Vendors ignoring the ban or seeking to challenge the ban on 1st Amendment protected sales and solicitations face the same risks and hurdles as vendors on Ann Arbor city streets and sidewalks. (see above)

&#x200B;

So it seems like they don't want food vendors there at all. If that is the case there won't be any other vendors to piss off. The whole idea seems pretty lax when it's described to me. If there's no official means to become a food vendor then it might be prudent to just go and let it get sorted out later.

"Yeah, that makes sense. It's what, another 3 months?

That said, I wouldn't be surprised if they also instituted it for the beginning of next year. It has VERY positive knock-on effects for other stuff, and there's a LOT of data to suggest that our ""Annual"" cold and flu season is driven specifically by children returning to school. It's not like a virus changes transmissibility by temperature fluctuations of a few degrees (Sept avg high is 76 degrees after all), it's that we tend to bunch up indoors with groups we wouldn't otherwise interact with at that point in time.

Throw some masks on for a few months, let those groups intermingle their germs slowly so that each person doesn't have to fight multiple new contagions at once, and you'd see less kids calling out sick, less parents having to take time off for their sick kids, and better outcomes for kids that do get sick.

There. That's the tantrum. 

If you can't wear a mask for a 30 minute meeting, then your views frankly aren't valid. That's the sort of thing that a child does when you tell them they can't have a candybar in the checkout line.

"The ""Insistence"" is because the mask policy is still in force.

Once that policy drops, so will masks. But it's currently still the rule for all AAPS events, including these meetings.

https://www.clickondetroit.com/all-about-ann-arbor/2022/02/13/aaps-masking-protocol-still-in-effect-despite-recent-reversal-by-health-department/

>Swift’s email noted that masks are still recommended by WCHD, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC for school-aged children two years and older and school staff when in public indoor settings, regardless of their vaccination status.

>Federal orders mandate masking on public transport, including school busses.

So although it is in AAPS's power to drop the policy, they're erring on the side of caution. Given the Risk vs Reward of dropping it, I frankly hope they keep it for the first 2 months of every school year. Then maybe we can finally ""Cure"" influenza like we did the last 2 years running. 

https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/PedFluDeath.html

The graph on the right with the green lines shows Pediatric Influenza deaths by year. If you click the orange ""All Deaths"" box it'll give you totals at the bottom. We dropped from ~200 child deaths a year to literally 1 in 2020, and 13 this current school year.

"**[Crust punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_punk)** 
 
 >Crust punk (also known as crust or stenchcore) is a form of music influenced by English punk rock and extreme metal. The style, which evolved in the early 1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. The term ""crust"" was coined by Hellbastard on their 1986 Ripper Crust demo. Crust is partly defined by its ""bassy"" and ""dirty"" sound.

"I feel the need to clarify the process that will occur when you report an encampment since there seems to be some concern about the issue.

Someone from parks will go out and look at the encampment to assess if it's active or abandoned, and the degree of cleanup and environmental remediation required. They will let the police know where the encampment is and some details about it. The police will eventually get around to checking it out, but they have a single officer assigned to this role so if they're on vacation or have more pressing matters to deal with it could be a while. The officer will visit the encampment and put up a sticker on the tent informing the person using it that they have 1 week to move all their belongings out before we remove them. Then the parks department will hire a contractor (unless it's trivially small and easy to remove) to remove all the trash and debris associated with the encampment. They used to have parks employees do this but after finding needles and bottles of yellow liquid they decided people with more training were required. 
It never takes less than a month to evict a squatter from the woods and it's always a huge pain for everyone involved so sometimes they prefer to look the other way if the encampment isn't causing any harm to the environment or the public's ability to us the park.",t2_pzsz7j3,awareofdog,0,1648137718.0,0,t1_i1y1iu0,i1y1iu0,False,thisguyluvslife,t3_tlys0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/tlys0f/besides_hash_bash_what_festivals_or_big_events/,besides hash bash.... what festivals or big events are coming up in ann arbor?,/r/AnnArbor/comments/tlys0f/besides_hash_bash_what_festivals_or_big_events/i1y1iu0/,2,r/AnnArbor,0,2

"Excerpt from mLive's subscriber-exclusive article [Ann Arbor mayor wants new city flag that residents will fly from porches with pride](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2022/03/ann-arbor-mayor-wants-new-city-flag-that-residents-will-fly-from-porches-with-pride.html):

>So, what got Taylor thinking about the city flag? He blames Roman Mars, host of the popular 99% Invisible podcast, who gave a TED Talk titled, “[Why city flags may be the worst-designed thing you’ve never noticed](https://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed?language=en).”  
>  
>Taylor, who lists 99% Invisible among his favorite podcasts, said Mars got him thinking about how flags can play an important role in civic identity and civic pride, talking about what makes a good city flag and a bad city flag, and how an outstanding design can have a positive community impact.  
>  
>“In considering Ann Arbor’s city flag, we don’t meet all those measures,” he said. “We don’t see the city flag portrayed with pride throughout the community. We don’t see the city flag on patches or laptop stickers and we ought to. I think folks love the town, and if we had a city flag that worked, we’d have another means of expressing that common affection.”  
>  
>Aside from the difficult visibility of yellow on white, Ann Arbor’s current flag commits one of the cardinal sins of civic flag design by including the city seal on it, he said, arguing the city should have a flag that follows good design principles.  
>  
>Taylor said he doesn’t have any preconceived notions about what should be on the flag, but the elements should reflect important aspects of the city. It wouldn’t shock him if that included a tree, but trees can be difficult for some people to draw, he said.  
>  
>“If you take a look at the TED Talk, take a look at the pamphlets and the teaching on vexillology, you’ll come to be advised that we all ought to be able to draw a city flag within a one-by-two-inch rectangle and it should be simple enough so that a child can pretty accurately draw it,” he said.",t2_5d4r3fng,bobi2393,0,1648075516.0,0,t1_i1ux8la,i1ux8la,True,[deleted],t3_tkqyyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/tkqyyj/new_simple_flag_design/,New simple flag design,/r/AnnArbor/comments/tkqyyj/new_simple_flag_design/i1ux8la/,1,r/AnnArbor,0,1

"I sell homemade soap in the area and am in a few shops. Networking and marketing is what gets you a display. Have a business plan in place  and a display already designed and ready to go. You will provide all display materials. Not the business. You will be responsible for replenishing the stock. While some small shops will contact you…not all will so you need to plan for that and maybe have set days you check on stores. 

Have a price point that is reasonable for retailers…they will pay you less and will sell for more so a good profit margin is motivating for them. 

You will want to visit their websites and look for information regarding soliciting sales. Some allow it. Some don’t. Some don’t have any info. If there is no “no soliciting” in place show up with free samples and a print out if your products and pricing with pictures of your display and what foot print your display will take. 

I got my first store by just shopping I’m the store and talking up the owner when checking out about my soaps and gave them a business card. I also made a point to attend events some small shops were holding so my face got known.

"I agree with opiates but that was mainly done by pharmaceuticals. The opiate crisis we have now is due to pharmaceuticals and greedy doctors push this to people who didn’t know how addictive it was.

Nobody who pushed those has faced any serious consequences. USA has jailed more folks for opiate addiction. Very few doctors and no one from pharmaceuticals was charged for pushing oxycodone as less addictive opiate. They literally played the heroin bs where it was marketed as less addictive then morphine.  

You can already buy alcohol at levels that will kill you. I’ve never been restricted from buy $500 worth of liquor. They don’t even ask is it actually for a party? We have more alcohol related deaths in that comparison.

Not saying folks should be over dosing but they already are with alcohol.

“Whoa,” McDermott says, lifting it up, fingering the card, genuinely impressed. “Very nice. Take a look.” He hands it to Van Patten.

“Picked them up from the printer’s yesterday,” I mention.

“Cool coloring,” Van Patten says, studying the card closely.

“That’s bone,” I point out. “And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.”

"Ah!  Then why did you do it, lol?  Just as a quick and dirty?  I still think the tree with a bar would have been better and gotten the message across.

Also, I did more research and turns out some cities do use a general logo in addition to an official seal and a flag.  Not all - New York doesn't, Chicago has a ""public mark"", Pittsburg does - but some do.  So I apologize for being quick to criticize in that regard.

But yeah, typically the seal is used for official purposes - documents, buildings, etc - and the flag is, well, a flag.  Still not sure what Pittsburg uses it's logo for exactly, but I guess if you don't want to use the full seal it's a nice alternative.  

Ann Arbor arguably doesn't need a new seal, we just need to get the seal off the flag and replace it with something better.

"I think this lacks creativity. How about we double-down on in-city transit to address the last-mile issue and get *those* cars off the road.

"> Most of the societal damage from drugs - the violence, the mass incarceration, the police state, the constitutional attacks - are because drugs are illegal. The exact same thing happened in the 1920s when we banned alcohol - did you learn nothing from history class?

You are *entirely* overlooking drug addiction, drug overdose, and drug-induced breaks from reality (tweaking, bad trips…) Entirely. You ever see a guy shoot up heroin? Because I have, and he wasn’t arrested, and his life sucked anyway. 

And I support decriminalization for users, which nullifies the mass incarceration/police state issues.

Everything causes problems. Some things cause a higher proportion of problems to the benefits they confer, and are a net negative.

"When you were a kid, people were licking radioactive materials to make bloody watches. They were also smoking, driving without seatbelts, castrating gay people, lobotomizing people... Do you see any problems with that argument? 

I feel like you have no idea what you’re talking about. Every drug with a *known* valid medical use that outweighs the risks and alternatives is available by prescription: benzos, opiates, stimulants, etc. Carfentanil, the one specific drug you suggest banning, is actually one of the few drugs of abuse that ARE used today in veterinary medicine. 

When we do more research on the benefits and risks of some of this stuff, like MDMA and LSD, we can revisit *legalizing* it. We can *decriminalize small possession* today. 

But most of it? Cocaine, meth, heroin? That’s banned for a reason. 

I don’t think you have any idea what you’re talking about. Crystal meth, for instance, causes “tweaking”, characterized by psychosis and aggression. Have you ever seen a photo of a methhead? 

Do you understand how addictive most of this shit is? Yes, we prescribe painkillers, but we prescribe the least dangerous ones that still get the job done. And people STILL end up addicted.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Went there earlier this week because the owner claimed his food was halal, had no proof or signage posted, and trash-talked Muslims to my face when I got there even though he knew I was muslim. Felt sick after eating half of my burrito and had to throw the rest away. Went in once in Fall for sit down and the hot sauce on the table was expired, the owner claimed that they refill the bottle which I'm pretty sure is illegal. Any Muslim people please watch out for this place, would not recommend it. Will definitely never go back there again and will tell others to the day I die about how shit it was.

Not the most handsome buildings to look at but a completely different story on the inside. Smell the fresh river air, sunsets and sunrises are beautiful, arboretum is a short walk, easy walk to downtown, access to b2b trail, quick bike ride to bird hills, kind people. 

Pretty phenomenal place to live, honestly. Just make sure you take your time to find the right unit.

"There are laws on how much rent can be raised. It varies depending on things like are you under a yearly contract or monthly contract. I would look up state laws on rental increase, I believe it's like 5% of current so if you're paying say 1500 that's only 75 more than your current contract.

"Vinca (another common name for periwinkle) is my yard's #2 Enemy, but the distance between it and English Ivy is actually pretty far. Vinca is not as inviting to mice and mosquitoes, it's annoying to pull up but just a fraction as difficult as ivy, it will not destroy your house if you let it grow near it, and while it will crowd around other plants, it can only overwhelm and kill the smallest ones. Vinca is mainly a problem because it's a missed opportunity for something better, and it's a problem that, like ivy, gets much worse if you ignore it. So I aim to remove it from my yard as time and energy permits, but without a ton of urgency.

What to replace it with is a big question that I'm still working on. I also went straight for Wild Ginger, for those shaded areas especially, but it's just so slow -- and I don't advise starting from seed. Plugs only, as it takes two years outside to germinate. I bought four plugs before I knew how slow it'd be, and I think it might fill the hundred square feet I got it for in ... I don't know, 4 or 5 years? :\ Something faster that I'm going to incorporate is [Big Leaf Aster](https://www.prairienursery.com/big-leaf-aster-aster-macrophyllus.html). I got myself a pinch of seeds off of a neighbor's lawn, who filled in a space under a couple pines with these and they looked really nice. Not really a ground cover though, especially once they flower, but it looked great. Another one I like that I already have in a lot of wetter spots in my yard is [Virginia Waterleaf](https://www.prairienursery.com/virginia-waterleaf-hydrophyllum-virginianum.html). It's *very* shade tolerant; it survived under some Ostrich Ferns in my yard, somehow. I also have a patch of [Solomon's Seal](https://www.prairienursery.com/solomons-seal-polygonatum-biflorum.html), which really stretches the definition of a ground cover but it's truly becoming one of my favorite plants for how gorgeous it is, its leaves looking like [a painting](https://cmsmedia.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vareigated-solomons-seal-abby.jpg), even as it dies back [in fall](https://sugarcreekgardens.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Polygonatum-odoratum-Variegatum-Solomons-Seal-fall-leaves.jpg) (I think those images have been enhanced a little, but only a little). People also speak highly of [Zigzag Goldenrod](https://www.prairienursery.com/zigzag-goldenrod-solidago-flexicaulis.html), but I have never planted it myself. These are just some of the possible solutions; there are some other suggestions in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NativePlantGardening/comments/pk01fx/looking_for_a_good_ground_cover_for_a_shady_area/).

It's actually frustrating for a lot of people that there are no native classic ground covers, i.e. creeping *and* durable the way Vinca and English Ivy can be. You can step all over those two and nothing will come of it, but for whatever reason, that's hard to find in North America. So as I've thought more about my garden, I've increasingly moved away from the idea of having a ground cover, and more towards patches of perennials, or encouraging spaces dominated by spring ephemerals that are just leaves the rest of the year (like the woods!).",t2_4aujy,itsdr00,0,1647910330.0,0,t1_i1lr170,i1lr170,False,artartstar,t3_sj4pe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/sj4pe0/personal_crusade_suggestions/,Personal crusade suggestions,/r/AnnArbor/comments/sj4pe0/personal_crusade_suggestions/i1lr170/,2,r/AnnArbor,0,2
