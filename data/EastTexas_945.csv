"That's the truth! A lot of people sadly have no idea what the night sky is supposed to look like without all the artificial light pollution that comes from human settlements. People who live in large/major cities will sometimes break down in tears when they get an opportunity to see what the natural night sky really looks like without artificial lighting. But more importantly, you don't have to be in a large city to miss out on this spectacular sight. Even small towns and many rural areas have diminished views of the night sky due to light pollution. All it takes, really, is one streetlamp or one porch light or one light mounted to a barn, etc., to really mess up the view. When there is a new moon (the opposite of a full moon), and when the sky is clear at night and there are no clouds or haze/fog, in the absence of any artificial light around you and your vicinity, the number of visible stars, planets, and constellations increases by a truly breathtaking amount. It is astonishing in the most unbelievable way! There are SO MANY celestial bodies in the sky, but we rarely see them. They are always there, though. Under such conditions, you can even see—with the naked eye—parts of the Milky Way's spiral galaxy arms. It's so very, very sad that we spend our lives glued to electronic screens.

&#x200B;

  
GARLAND, Texas - A grand jury indicted the father of a Garland 14-year-old triple murder suspect after authorities said he drove his son to and from the fatal shooting.  


  
Richard Acosta Jr., 33, was indicted on a capital murder of multiple persons charge by a Dallas County grand jury Thursday.  


  
The shooting happened on the day after Christmas, when police said Acosta’s son, 14-year-old Abel Elias Acosta, opened fire in a Garland Texaco, killing three other teenagers and injuring one other person.  


  
Authorities said Richard didn't pull the trigger, but he did help his son commit the murders.  


  
He is accused of driving his son to the Texaco gas station, where police said the 14-year-old is seen on video firing multiple gunshots.  


  
""In the video, it’s clear as day, Abel Acosta was the one to pull the trigger. The father was in the car and he is still charged with capital murder,"" Garland PD Lt. Pedro Barineau said.  


  
""There are certain parts of investigations and involvements in cases, where even though someone may not have caused the injury or damage, they too can be charged with the exact same crime.""  


  
Police identified Richard by using surveillance video and he turned himself in after seeing his image on the news after the shooting, but Abel has been on the run since the shooting.  


  
""We have not gotten any assistance from him. We have gotten nothing in leading to where Abel Acosta is,"" Barineau said.  


  
U.S. Marshals are helping Garland police search for a 14-year-old who is an accused killer.  


  
A $10,000 reward has been offered for information on the teen, but police have not yet received any concrete leads into his whereabouts.  


  
Investigators said they are regularly getting tips as to where the teenager may be, but none so far have resulted in finding him.They don't even know if he's still in the country.  


  
""He is 14, yes, which leads us to believe he is reliant on some people, but we can’t prove that,"" Barineau said. ""The fact that he is nowhere around and no one is coming forward leads us to believe someone is helping.""  


  
While tips have not been fruitful yet, Barineau said detectives won’t stop until they get justice for the victims.  


  
""They don’t rest well because, as police officer’s our job is to keep our community safe. So when there is someone we know is armed and dangerous, who has committed such a horrendous act, killing three people, wounding a fourth, shooting multiple times, they are still out there, that’s hard for us because we know that people can’t rest,"" he added.

A husband and father of three from Texas is facing murder charges in the deadly shooting of his wife.

  
According to NBCDFW, on Sunday (Oct. 18), police in Mesquite, Texas—a suburban city located near Dallas—discovered the body of 28-year-old Markeita McCleary with multiple gunshot wounds around 5:34 p.m. local time.  


  
Police said McCleary was taken to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead.  


  
McCleary’s husband, Ashton Neroes, who is also 28, was subsequently arrested and charged with murder in connection to the shooting, police said. He’s being held on $100,000 bond.  


  
According to unconfirmed social media reports, Markeita had recently caught Ashton having an affair, and asked him for a divorce shortly before she was fatally shot 10 times in front of their three children.  
Ashton and Markeita were very active on Facebook, and news of the murder came as a shock to those who knew the couple and viewed them as a picture-perfect family on social media.  


  
In addition to sharing photos of their family, Ashton also frequently posted inspirational messages and Christian scripture.  


  
In one particular post, just hours before the shooting, Ashton wrote on Facebook:  


  
THE PROBLEM WITH HUMANITY IS EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE AN ANIMAL “THE GOAT” I CLEAR UNDERSTAND IT BEING AN ACRONYM OF “THE GREATEST OF ALL TIMES” BUT ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION IS HUMANIYT REALLY GREAT IN THE EYES OF GOD IS GOD PLEASED WITH THE DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS COMMANDMENTS  


  
OPEN THAT BIBLE FOLLOW CHRIST “THE REAL GOAT” WHO LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR OURS  


  
And in another post on Facebook, which Ashton shared less than an hour before Markeita was found by police suffering from multiple gunshots wounds, he eerily wrote: “Never GOT CLOSURE but I’ll walk away a winner regardless”

I played in one just like it in Flint Tx as a kid. It  was about 30' tall and had a small door that went inside and almost looked like a grain silo inside. It had a conveyor that ran up to the top and there was a small ladder up one side and a small catwalk at the top. It had a pile of wood chips in the center that had been fed up the conveyor and dumped in through the top. It sat right next to an old rail way and wood pallet factory.

"Your absolutely right. I missed that even in the proofread.

While paying a fortune for some ply at home depot this Saturday I saw that they are now renting some self proclaimed ""heavy equipment,"" which just may be another avenue to look into depending on where you priced your original rentals at.

All the best in your endeavors and post me a pic when done if you don't mind. I'm curious to see the route you go and how it turns out. I too live in DFW but have some close friends with property out east.

I have a friend that can help you out with equipment for brush clearing. He will do it very reasonably.

Which is the case. My issue is that the property lines are close, and the cost of renting the equipment I need would probably be nearly as much as doing it myself,  but without me having to drive 1.2 hours to do it (I live a mile from downtown Dallas.)

"The border of Mexico is approximately 560 miles away from me and the only things I know about it are what I've read in the news or heard from a few people who have been there in the past, mostly as children long ago before the Bush border fence was put up. I have lived in or visited family who live in west, central, north, southeast, and east Texas (my family has lived in Texas for generations) and the closest I've ever been to Mexico was still over 150 miles from the border. 

In the future if you revisit this issue you may want to target people that have more familiarity with the border, maybe with a question about having lived or traveled near the border within the past ten years. Texas is so huge that I'd reckon a lot of Texans don't have much familiarity with it, Mexico is pretty far away from the most populous area of the state which is within the triangle formed by San Antonio, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Houston.

"In the beginning, M.W. Dogan Elementary School served African-American students in Marshall beginning with the opening of the school in 1949.

The school was named in honor of Wiley College president, M.W. Dogan. The original building had 10 classrooms, and was built to replace the New Town School that dated back to 1916. Mr. W. J. White, who had been principal at New Town, was the first principal at the new Dogan Elementary but he died before his first term ended.

Price T. Young succeeded White and served Dogan as principal for many years. The school remained in operation through the era of integration until it closed in 1981 during a reorganization of Marshall ISD. The building was sold and is now privately owned, and its location within the “New Town Neighborhood” has historic significance to Marshall’s African-American community.[M.W.

"Northeast Texas? As opposed to Houston/Beaumont/etc.

If so.. I'm hesitant to say, but consider Tyler. Amenities of a medium-sized city with the look and feel of a small town. Old downtown, brick roads webbing out from the city center, very pretty.

The only reason I'm hesitant to suggest it is the people - as someone who spent most of his formative years there, the people are a little strange, often antisocial (maybe a good thing during a pandemic).

Not far off you have Kilgore (smaller, somewhat more of a college town), Mineola with some historical sites and possibly Longview.

If you do visit Tyler, check out the Rose Garden and Tyler State Park. Great way to behold its beauty with minimal social interaction and disease risk.

The zoo isn't bad, either. They just had a cute baby giraffe born 2-3 months ago. Ordinarily there's a cool Tiger wildlife refuge (think Joe Exotic except they don't breed and actually care about their animals), but they're closed for COVID-19.

"The best outdoor shooting range around Longview in my opinion is the East Texas Rifle and Pistol Club.

https://etrpc.com/

They have several pistol ranges as well as rifle ranges all the way out to 300 yards and a skeet range for shotguns. You pay a one time membership and you can use any range all day every day and you don't have to pay any daily fees. You can also bring guests for free.

I recommend taking a handgun class (some are offered at ETRPC, others available around town) or doing a lot of self-education before taking the pistol to the range if you haven't ever shot a gun before.

Okay so you don’t like that scenario lol. Put yourself and the neighbor both at the grocery store. Or maybe replace the neighbor with the cashier, who catches it from you and is also asymptomatic but gives it to her premie newborn. Or replace the cashier with literally anyone else. The point is wearing a mask could help protect the people surrounding you whoever and wherever you are. Grandma or stranger. 

I’m not from the left, I assure you. I never said I was trying to create a “safe space”.  There’s no way to make this world safe. But there’s no harm at all in trying to take all the steps we can to make it as safe as we can. If you live in a high crime area you’re gonna lock your door at night. Someone could still break in.

"They’re not just a placebo. They may not block 100% of germs but if they block 50% or even 30% or 10% that’s better than 0%. 

And they’re not to make folks feel safe. It’s not even really about protecting yourself. It’s about trying to protect others. Say you’re positive but asymptomatic. You’re a good guy so you offer to pick up groceries for your elderly neighbor who had cancer several years ago. You deliver her the groceries and sneeze near her, but you’re not sick and you decided you didn’t need a mask. Only you DO have the virus. She gets germs from your sneeze on her hand and then later touches her eye. A week or so later she has a full blown case of covid. With all her other health problems she just can’t fight it, and she dies. You did that. 

Not saying the mask would have 100% saved her, but it might have made a difference. If she had one on too it would have helped protect her a little more. *That’s* why people should wear masks. Because they care about *other people*. Sadly, I don’t think the majority of people in our world today give a shit about others. They’re too focused on fighting about what’s important for themselves to realize what’s really important: loving their neighbors and treating people how they’d like to be treated.

"After living in a large metropolitan city for most of my life, here are my observations after moving to East Texas a few short years ago:

1. The best restaurants are local, but close early (by 8:00 pm).  If you're a late diner like me, you're out of luck.
1. There aren't many good radio stations, and those I like are hard to receive and usually come with lots of static.
1. Gossip seems to be a chief pastime for people here.  No one can keep a secret. 
1.  If you do something just beyond the local expected behaviors, it will be known and talked about.
1. East Texas is not an easy place for friends to visit.  They will have to drive long distances to see you since there are no close airports.  The same applies if you want to visit your friends in other cities.  Get ready for a long road trip.
1. Church life is a huge part of living in the East Texas community.  It's just expected that you will join a church and attend regularly.
1. There are a lot of pickup trucks with extremely loud mufflers.
1. There's a very clear social status structure in place.  You find yours, settle in, and don't try to move up.  You won't be accepted.
1. Grocery stores are barely adequate and the prices are higher as compared to big city grocers.  You'll need to downsize your expectations.
1. Gasoline is expensive and all the stations are in lockstep with the high prices.
* There's never a good time of day to go to Walmart.  It's always crowded.  There's only one.

"Nacogdoches is a great place to live but it is not perfect. 

Pro's.

1. Drive anywhere in town in ten minutes.
2. The movie theater is almost never full.
3. Access to local wineries that make wine superior to what you can buy in the stores.
4. The local brewery has incredible custom beers.
5. Lots of great restaurants and food trucks.
6. Not far from much bigger cities with lots of things to see and do, without the hassle of big city traffic on a daily basis. Houston 3-4 hours. Dallas 3-4 hours. Shreveport 1 hour. Austin 5 hours. San Antonio 5-6 hours. Each of these can be reached on a day trip or a weekend trip.
7. Low cost of living.
8. In four or five hours we can drive to the ocean in Galveston, or the mountains in Arkansas. 
9. Easily reach hiking trails where you can get away from civilization. We are surrounded by natural parks and woods. 
10. SFA has all kinds of things to see and do.

Con's

1. The job market is limited although unemployment is relatively low. Be prepared to get a job in the service sector or one of the manufacturing plants.
2. There is not much divide between various cultures. You are likely to be exposed to rednecks, capitalists, communists, Christians, Pagan's, and Muslims on a daily basis. If coexistence is not an option, it will likely irritate you. I listed this as a con because even though it does not bother me, it is a common complaint.
3. Drug use is not as hidden as it is in larger cities. 
4. There is a reason there are so many private schools. The public school is not very good. It is a shame that not all families place as much importance on education as they should. But some people just treat school as free day care and the quality of education suffers as a result.",t2_bl234,Tapochka,0,1581873741.0,0,t1_fhtepm5,fhtepm5,True,isingrid66,t3_f4nl6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/EastTexas/comments/f4nl6v/moving_to_nacogdoches_opinions/,Moving to Nacogdoches: Opinions?,/r/EastTexas/comments/f4nl6v/moving_to_nacogdoches_opinions/fhtepm5/,6,r/EastTexas,0,6

"While I can certainly see the appeal in this, it is a great way to get in a lot of trouble. The three biggest issues is the problem of liability, the problem of trespassing, and the problem of injury. In more practical terms, legally speaking, there is no such thing as an abandoned space. What this means is that if you go into abandoned factory X, the persons legally responsible for X are legally bound to take whatever measures are necessary to prevent this from happening, including calling the police on you or even simply shooting you. This is because if you get injured on the property then they can be held legally liable for that injury. So by going into a place that only looks abandoned, you are actually trespassing on property the owners are legally obliged to protect. If they cannot show that they took every reasonable precaution to prevent you from hurting yourself, they risk losing everything in a lawsuit. For the person who does not actually have much, but happens to own a piece of property that includes an abandoned building, the risk of lawsuits creates a situation where shooting the trespasser becomes less of a legal risk than ignoring them and then getting sued. 

This is why old places get chained up and fenced up and signs are posted all over the place. Often times they are simply torn down. More modern abandoned places might even have cameras set up that are still active simply to add a layer of protection against lawsuits.",t2_bl234,Tapochka,0,1581161875.0,0,t1_fgwjesq,fgwjesq,True,insanejokesterbabyy,t3_f0e5zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/EastTexas/comments/f0e5zt/urban_exploration/,Urban Exploration,/r/EastTexas/comments/f0e5zt/urban_exploration/fgwjesq/,2,r/EastTexas,0,2

"Thanks yeah checking out the music stores was my first step here, and then the open mics at the Foundry. I found the music stores to be a bit depressing and mostly focused on selling instruments to kids - which I don't mind, I think it's great for kids to have that opportunity. 

I mentioned the video games in the event that anyone else might want to hang out and play stuff together, but I'm definitely going to learn to play magic and try a couple of the game stores.

Thank you for your reply!",t2_51o64cu9,the_deheeheemons,0,1580483251.0,0,t1_fg3jtvb,fg3jtvb,False,[deleted],t3_ewaapl,https://www.reddit.com/r/EastTexas/comments/ewaapl/just_moved_to_tyler/,Just moved to Tyler,/r/EastTexas/comments/ewaapl/just_moved_to_tyler/fg3jtvb/,1,r/EastTexas,0,1
"My first thought is to check out a local music store. I do not know what is around Tyler offhand but my local music store has postings for small venue concerts which includes Jazz and indie music. I prefer going to the ones that do not take place in bars. The few I have attended were small enough that I was able to make small talk with my neighbors between sets. I have noticed some faces seem to attend every one of them and they seem to congregate together before and after. 

Another possible option, depending on your tolerance level for alcohol, is a local winery. If you can handle one glass, the people who go seem to be exceptionally friendly to strangers. I do not drink much and can spend five dollars for one glass (no cover charge) and chat for an hour. 

Unfortunately, I do not see much opportunity to meet people with video games as a hobby. Perhaps you could develop a new hobby. I have noticed a local store that hosts Magic the Gathering and D&D meetups which has a good attendance and who are very friendly to outsiders. There is also a local LARP group that is very welcoming to outsiders. Not sure if Tyler has one of these options but expanding your hobbies might open additional opportunities.",t2_bl234,Tapochka,0,1580434444.0,0,t1_fg1wxra,fg1wxra,True,[deleted],t3_ewaapl,https://www.reddit.com/r/EastTexas/comments/ewaapl/just_moved_to_tyler/,Just moved to Tyler,/r/EastTexas/comments/ewaapl/just_moved_to_tyler/fg1wxra/,2,r/EastTexas,0,2

"I think that’s a very fair question. Anyone that lives outside of the ‘norm’ and/or acceptable has the right to ask such a question. My situation is different but similar in the sense that my life choices are outside the ‘norm’ and have often left me feeling very ostracized and alone. I am a white female with 2 biracial children. Born, raised and still living in East Texas so I know how judgmental people can be. While you’ll find a few people who are very vocal and brazen that’ll insult you to your face, the large percentage will do it behind your back (which in my opinion is so much worse.) East Texas is in the Bible Belt, thick with conservative views and all too often stereotypical behaviors. I think it’s important to remember that it’s okay to be different, it’s okay to go against the everyday mundane opinions/values, but in the same instance you have to be prepared for those that do not embrace with an open mind. 

I’m speaking from experience only so I hope no one attacks me for my statement. I was raised in the church. Disowned by my ‘Christian’ family for dating a black man and I have a very hard time finding a place where I belong. And it’s been 14 years. 

Because I’ve experienced the judgment of a different lifestyle I understand the hardships that come with it. I do wish I lived in a community that was more accepting and open minded but this is my reality.

"You know, when I was a little boy, there was an old Negro farmer lived down the road from us, name of Monroe. And he was, uh, well, I guess he was just a little luckier than my Daddy was. He bought himself a mule. That was a big deal around that town. Now, my Daddy hated that mule, cause his friends were always kidding him about oh, they saw Monroe out plowing with his new mule, and Monroe was gonna rent another field now they had a mule. And one morning that mule just showed up dead. They poisoned the water. And after that there was never any mention about that mule around my Daddy. It just never came up. So one time, we were driving down the road and we passed Monroe's place and we saw it was empty. He'd just packed up and left, I guess. Gone up North, or something. I looked over at my Daddy's face and I knew he'd done it. And he saw that I knew. He was ashamed. I guess he was ashamed. He looked at me and he said: 'If you ain't better than a nigger, son, who are you better than?!... I said, Damn Daddy, you are absolutely right, let’s organize a Klan meeting.

Yes, I remember years ago elsewhere (not east TX) I would hear of a given community fighting against being ""annexed"" by the city, and now I see why. It's amusing to me, annoying in fact, that you're driving around way out in the boonies with cows and such with houses OODLES apart from each other and no stores etc anywhere, yet you're in the ""city limits.""

Where I am at I don't think I have to worry about annexation, at least it SEEMS that way anyway. I don't like it, though, driving in these sections and cops hanging around trying to bust people for going 56 in a 55. It's ridiculous. You figure you get out to the country you GET AWAY from that sort of nonsense you put up with in the city, yet there it is anyway.

If the current mayor of Whereever Texas wants municipal water to some acreage he purchased you might see the city limits extended that direction.

"From my understanding, that's incorrect.
LKC owns the cable lines as they were responsible (directly or indirectly) for initially wiring up the city. For telcos, there are laws that say that whomever owns the lines has to allow other telcos to provide competing service over the same lines – but cable companies are under no such law.
Therefore, for Suddenlink to compete, they'd have to run their own lines across the city, which would be a massive cost/investment – and that's the only thing preventing them from doing so.

There have been moves over the years to transfer ownership to local governments to allow any company to use this wire, but it's always been met with harsh opposition form Telco and cable lobbyists.

"I've been covered by them for 10+ years when I was still in my parent's house and now for several months on my own. My complaints are:

1) Random periods where the Internet becomes very slow, sometimes just shy of unusable. These can last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks. They don't really seem to correlate with anything either, you never know when it might happen. Luckily it's not ridiculously often, but more often than it should be. 

2) Same as 1, but the Internet just randomly cuts in and out so you can never maintain a good connection to anything. These usually only last a day, but are extremely frustrating.

3) Bad customer service. I haven't dealt with them directly as much as my parents have, but their advice is unhelpful, they're slow to do anything, and several times they just didn't show up on a day they said they would without any sort of notice.

4) The equipment you can rent from them is pretty bad. I definitely would recommend buying your own wireless router if you can to avoid headaches with theirs. Getting a modem from them isn't terrible, but still not great. 

5) Personally my biggest issue, their prices are just really high for what they're offering. The down/up speeds and data caps are pretty small, and then they slap a huge price on them and act like they're giving you a great deal. If you look at service packages in areas with decent competition, you'll see just how bad it is. Add in all the issues from above, and it's really just a terrible deal. 

That's my experience anyway. I could just be unlucky, but many of my friends who have dealt with them have experienced similar problems.

"I just want to throw a tip your way. 

When you are approaching an intersection where you have no stop sign but the cross street does (this includes parking lot exits as you approach them) keep an eye on the hubcaps of any vehicles stopped there because that will be the first thing you notice in case they don't see you and start to pull out. Doing this has saved me a few times.

Maybe downtown would be a good place to practice. The traffic is slow, lots of lights, lots of parking lots, and they haven't mucked up the medians there yet. Speed limit is 35. Maybe that will help you get comfortable before hitting the other areas.

Just wait till you try Dallas! Lol. Moved from Tyler to Dallas about 10 years ago and was scared to death about driving. Turned out driving in Dallas was easier than tyler. Go figure!  

Good luck hun, and never ever let anyone pressure you to go until you are comfortable that it's safe. No matter how much they honk. They can't see what you can see.

Also, when behind another vehicle at a right turn yield, please please make sure that car is actually gone before you try to go. I'm am insurance claims adjuster and i can't even tell you how many calls i get with this exact scenario where a driver ahead moved up to see better and stopped then got rear ended by the car behind, all because the rear car assumed the front car had gone already .

"In general, I would say you make a fair point, but Papacita's chips and salsa are just out of this world.  I'd disagree and say the fajitas are just alright, but their enchiladas are pretty good stuff.

Bodacious is pretty good for chain BBQ, but I was assuming that they've had it before.  I'm pretty sure that they've made it to the DFW area and I was trying to get something local.

I've never had the Dairy Palace, but now it's on the list of places I've got to hit -- thanks for that!",t2_hixnx,Burnaman,0,1479216048.0,0,t1_da17831,da17831,False,knotquiteawake,t3_5cyqao,https://www.reddit.com/r/EastTexas/comments/5cyqao/any_good_places_to_stop_and_eat_between_dfw_and/,Any good places to stop and eat between DFW and Caddo Lake?,/r/EastTexas/comments/5cyqao/any_good_places_to_stop_and_eat_between_dfw_and/da17831/,1,r/EastTexas,0,1
"Oh lord, don't send them to Papacita's. The fajitas are tasty but that's absolutely it. The rest is completely typical, run of the mill Tex-Mex.    
Bodacious BBQ is the local go-to BBQ favorite. Carters in Longview is also good.

Jucy's is a good burger, but so is Dairy Palace in Canton. That's quite a difference in distance so it kinda matters when you get hungry. Canton or hour+ later in Longview. There's also a Bodacious in Marshall if you're still not hungry when you get to Longview.",t2_2hn6g,grendelt,0,1479181517.0,0,t1_da0te43,da0te43,False,knotquiteawake,t3_5cyqao,https://www.reddit.com/r/EastTexas/comments/5cyqao/any_good_places_to_stop_and_eat_between_dfw_and/,Any good places to stop and eat between DFW and Caddo Lake?,/r/EastTexas/comments/5cyqao/any_good_places_to_stop_and_eat_between_dfw_and/da0te43/,6,r/EastTexas,0,6
