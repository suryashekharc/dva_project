"I hope you like a slow pace and kind of dull routine. Paducah is one of the biggest cities in the western Kentucky area and it's still pretty small town. It has a half empty mall, there's some cute stuff down town by the river front, if you like to sit and watch barges pass, that's fine. If you're looking for any kind of night life, I assume you'll get bored rather quickly. There's a few dive bars and a few trendy type places with metal stools and strings of Edison light bulbs, turn-key ambiance. The whole area is pretty poor, I grew up around here and I wouldn't wish it on anybody. Most of the people kind of seem nice enough but it's still extremely red trump country. Oh, and then there's [this](https://twitter.com/Joe_Gerth/status/1025511381121028097?t=izWmonfGjePJiuAGsUNRCA&s=19) 

I don't know what you're looking for in a town but if you're absolutely sure you want to move to a sleepy little town where not much happens, a place that seems exactly like every small town you see on described in the first 25 seconds of a dateline episode right before they say ""... Until it was *rocked* by the discovery of a 24 year old waitress's body""

There is a community college there, part of the KCTCS family of schools, there is a UK college of engineering satellite school there, I am in their mechanical engineering program there. Also, Murray State University is about 40 ish minutes (?) away. I would only recommend MSU if you're planning on doing something with agriculture or farm animals. They do have the best pre-vet program in the state.

I won't sugar coat it, for all of the little tiny economically depressed hick towns around here, Paducah is the big city with all the good shopping and ""fine dining"" Applebee's and TGI Fridays and a long horn steak house and so on. But it's still a small town main street America type place that is pretty boring if you're used to a slightly bigger city.

Paducah is really close to a big federal land preserve called land between the lakes if you're into camping and ATV riding and fishing and hiking and so on

You said you have the option to move here, is it for a job? If so, what kind of job and what is the pay? If you have other options, what are those? How big is your family, how old are your kids? I'm not sure about purchasing a home, Paducah might be suffering the same outrageous price hikes as elsewhere in the country if there's even anything available but if you're thinking you're going to rent a place, check Zillow, check apartments . com, rent . com there is NOTHING for rent that isn't an absolute shit box complex and there's only like 3 of those.  do you think you will live here until you retire or is it possible you will move again somewhere else?

Pretty boring if you expect any sort of big-city life. For instance, Nashville is considered “going to the city.” there. Having said that, it’s fairly liberal there socially, compared to when I grew up there.

"Paducah is the biggest city in the area with much to offer. Paducah is low crime, the cost of living is low, the traffic is easy, the people are friendly. There are numerous decent restaurants and bars both here and in the neighboring counties. The live music scene is impressive and there are an amazing amount of cultural opportunities for such a small community. We have numerous outdoor activities, not just hunting and fishing, but hiking, biking and paddling. Three rivers border our city and two enormous lakes are 30 minutes away,  along with the incomparable Land Between the Lakes.

"1. Eat - I Highly reccomend Freight house for dinner. If you're around for lunch, check out Kirchoff's. 

2. Drink - a few people have mentioned Dry Ground and Paducah Beer werks, but I also want to give a shoutout to the cocktail bars downtown. Johnson Bar, Foxbriar, the old fashioned cigar bar, and Barrel&Bond are all really nice and within a few blocks of each other. several places around with live music on weekends. Cigar bar has live music on Wednesday night. The Downtown riverfront area is nice to walk around even if you aren't going to have a drink.
3. Do - The Shawnee Forrest is very nice and close. There are also several really nice wineries in the shawnee area. You can make a whole weekend just out of winery hopping. Panthers Den is a hike close to the most popular winery - Blue Sky.

"Et Cetera 6th street location if you want a wonderful place to sit and enjoy some coffee or tea. Besides Freight House, which /u/proudtaco already mentioned and is amazing, I'd recommend checking out Jasmine Thai, which has excellent Thai food for the size of Paducah (I'd stay away from their Chinese/Japanese dishes, which are fine, but their Thai dishes are much better).

About the same distance from Smithland to Paducah is Patti's. The food isn't amazing, but if your uncle is a typical middle-aged person, he'd probably like going there.

Also if you're an outdoor person, Garden of the Gods is about 1.5 hours away in Illinois (it's actually much closer to Smithland than that, but the bridges aren't conveniently located).",t2_4hdkq,grahamiam,0,1647841750.0,0,t1_i1hyzp5,i1hyzp5,True,iamkipalan,t3_tj23wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/paducah/comments/tj23wm/paducah_visit_recommendations_request/,Paducah Visit (Recommendations Request),/r/paducah/comments/tj23wm/paducah_visit_recommendations_request/i1hyzp5/,5,r/paducah,0,5

"Sorry, I don't use reddit much anymore and didn't see this message until now. Yes I did move to Paducah, but I have since moved away. I was there between 2019 and 2021 (I left March of '21) for work at the old uranium enrichment plant. 

How did I find it....hmmmm...Well it had it's pros and cons. Overall, I'm happy that I got to experience the area, but am more happy to have left. I ended up living downtown on 7th street in this great loft above my landlord's workshop. Great location, I LOVED that place. So I got to experience all of the downtown attractions like the concerts and festivals. I was also walking distance from the nice restaurants by the river. I spent a lot of time down there.

The people are generally great. Ya know, good southerners. The hospitality felt like home (from GA originally). I ended up joining a golf club (Rolling Hills). I spent a good bit of time in the national parks north of Paducah in IL and MO, which were nice and about what I expected. The local beer was nice. Wifi was good where I was at too. Cost of living was pretty low (especially compared to where I live now).

However, I had a hard time making friends my age. That's probably half on me though. When I would go out, the groups really seemed to fall into two categories, neither of which were especially interested in adding members. There were the salt-of-the-earth type. Those who had lived in the city their whole lives, drank cold draft beer, and danced to country. They were all high school or earlier friend groups. Then there were the rich snooty types whose parents had tons of cash from one business or another in town. Typically drank at that place on like 5th or 6th (can't remember the name now). I didn't seem to fit with either as an engineer nerdy type. Also, the best friends I made were coworkers who both ended up moving about a year or so into when I moved there. So that contributed to my desire to leave.

There's a lot more about Paducah I could say. I mean it was about 2 years of my life, so a lot happened. Let me know if you have any questions. Do you live there now?

"Well first off, welcome to Paducah! I’m Alex. I hope you prosper and find lots of enjoyment here. As far as a diner for coffee and pancakes, there are your regular franchised restaurants such as The Waffle House in Lone Oak and on Southside as well. If you’re looking for more of a hometown, hole-in-the-wall type place, you could visit The Waffle Hut on Old Cairo Road or Mel’s Diner on Bliech road in Lone Oak. 

As far as entertainment, you can never go wrong with pool or bowling. If you are wanting to bowl however, it’s worth jumping to the next town over in Metropolis to hit up Super Bowl. It’s a nice one. Vertical Jump is a nice trampoline park at the mall and no it’s not just for kids! Lol. I’m 30 and enjoy it. Noble Park has really nice basketball courts and a skatepark, although it’s freezing outside of course. Movie theater, mall etc. all the normal stuff.

I know that’s not much, but this time of year is just kind of boring here. In the spring and summer they will have “downtown after dinner”. You walk down broadway and there’s live music on every block among other things. If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to message me. I’ve lived here pretty much my whole life.

"Lowertown/downtown is the most walkable part of Paducah. Turn a corner here, there's a bank. Want to shop? Turn this corner for a small grocery store. Not what you had in mind when I said shop? Just go to Broadway. One door goes into a realtor agency if you need it, or maybe you'd like something a little older? Just 3 doors down you'll find the antique mall. Hungry from all that walking? Just walk across or down the street, you'll find plenty of places to eat. After all that maybe you're interested in some spiritual healing? Don't worry, there's a church on practically every street. But maybe that's not the spiritual healing you wanted? On the edge of the main strip there's a reiki shop, and if that doesn't suit your fancy you could definitely check the rock shop which offers crystals, singing bowls, tarot, and much more.

"Howdy! I've been living in Paducah my whole life, and while I still don't know exactly everything, I'd love to try and help! 

As for phone service: avoid TracFone. I made the mistake of getting it and boy have I been paying for it, however it's child company, Straight Talk, works like a charm here in Paducah! Cricket has also never been bad from personal experience. 

I'm not too familiar with home internet options per se, but Comcast/Xfinity seem to be one of the most used in our town! 

As far as avoiding places go, I'm not really sure. Maybe as you're moving in, I'd avoid some of the back roads simply cause they're easy to get lost in, especially when you're unfamiliar with the place. 

If you're moving into lowertown Paducah, we actually have a lowertown welcoming committee! They only really spread through word of mouth, and I think they have a website! If you're going to move into lower/downtown then they'll be an amazing resource for your first few weeks here! I hear they even provide coupons and discounts to various lowertown stores, shops, and restaurants! Also, you absolutely must check out the river and the flood wall if you haven't already. As my boss says ""Paducah is one of the few river cities I've ever seen that acts like anything but a river city."" 

Oh, and if you ever feel like venturing out some sunny (or rainy) day, go to one of the small time shops downtown like ""Just off the corner"" or ""The 505"" or other small business and tell them you're new!

"There's nothing super special about Paducah. It's ""nice enough"" and there's a river front and a really pretty looking down town area with a river front area where they've painted all of the buildings to look kind of retro in that ""down town rejuvenation"" style. Noble park puts up a pretty crowded lights show every Christmas which is usually worth a gander. Pretty damn good barbecue and a big barbecue festival every year (in non covid times) but even if it is the kind of ""fancy town"" in the area, there are still plenty of rednecks. I hope you're looking to buy a house because there is absolutely shit for rentals. 3 listings on Zillow last I checked. Your kids would either be going to Paducah schools or McCracken county schools. I recommend Paducah over county schools. Paducah Tighlman high school has a good football team, big rivalry with a nearby tiny high school called Mayfield. (My home town. If you want the broad strokes of Mayfield, watch the movie varsity blues. There are senior citizens in my town who haven't missed a Friday night game since they themselves attended high school) there are plenty of shopping center type places, a couple good Asian buffets, a Lowes, a red lobster, everything you'd expect to fine in a regular to mid sized town/city. Also, pawn shops, peddlers malls, plenty places to buy a boat or get a boat worked on... But most of the surrounding area is pretty rural and uninteresting. I've lived in the purchase area most of my life and I can't wait to leave it. I got out for a while but I've since moved back home to go back to college (again. I already have one bachelor's and am working for another one) there is a community college in Paducah so your kids can get all of their gen-ed classes out of the way there and then transfer somewhere else. Murray State University is close but I would only recommend that school if your kids want to do something with horses, ag business, shit like that. I'll put it this way, MSU runs commercials at like 2 in the morning. I don't feel like that's a sign of a good school. (Also, I got a degree from there. Not a fan) the community college does have a UK engineering satellite school. If your kids are interested in mechanical or chemical engineering, they can get a full ABET accredited engineering bachelor's but save up some money to allow them live so they can try to get internships somewhere else because there's not much around here. Most of my class mates just go intern at one of the chemical plants in Calvert city (about 40 minutes away). If this is something you'd care about, this area is pretty hardcore Trump country, you'll see pick up trucks with big ""fuck Biden"" flags... Oh, and [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/joe_gerth/status/1025511381121028097) all in all, if you're from a bigger area and have convinced you want to see what ""small town life"" is like, sure, you'll probably be ""happy enough"" here. It's a decent enough place to grow old, I guess.

If it fits the bill - the chamber of commerce has a “young professionals” group that might be worth looking into.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

">Never did I once say you gave me false information.

Re-read the post I copied that line from. 

Then re-read everything you have said so far.

What is your exact problem if I answered the question you had originally asked? You not taking it literal isn't anyone else's problem. You asked a question, I answered it. Did you want me to obfuscate things? Did you want me to lie?

> If I told you to go to a fish restaurant they have great tables. You would also assume they sold you fish to eat.

This doesn't sync with what I had said to you though. In your bad analogy, it would be as if I said gaming store and there was no gaming done at all. 

But re-read earlier posts. I said it was open space with tables for gaming. I didn't say it had any major supplies for D&D or otherwise. 

You are now trying to call me a dick when you'ev ignored what I said or tried to turn 'literal' into a negative. You asked a question and I gave you the most direct, accurate answer that even you labelled as 'literal' and you're giving me shit for it.

If you didn't want a fucking answer to your question, don't ask the question. And don't give people shit for answering the question when you admit there is nothing wrong with the answer!

You asked a question and was surprised to be directly answered?

It isn't. And again, you are admitting that I answered literally/directly that it doesn't have gaming supplies. 

> I just didn't want someone else to waste the 15 minutes driving up there to be surprised by the lack of gaming supplies.

Because, as you have admitted several times now, I directly stated it was an open space store for gaming at? Not necessarily supplies ( excluding Games Worshop product ). You having issue with the fact I directly answered the questions isn't my or other's concerns. That is a failing on you as the OP when directly answered. 

>Which none of your posts today have done btw.

None of my posts from explicitly today has anything to do with contributing to the question. the question's answers were already given and for the umpteenth time, you admitted to them being accurate.

"I had similar concerns about the crime rate when moving back (having lived in Seattle). There are even web sites that call out Paducah as having higher rates than Louisville.  Being from Paducah and visiting regularly, this did not feel accurate to me, or my friends and family that live in town.  

I asked one of my good Seattle friends who is also a Paducah native about this metric.  He works in demographics and urban planning.  He said it was a case of incomparable percentages.  The population of Paducah is skewed towards the county.  When evaluating crime rates in the city, the base is the city population, which is only about 30K. But most people live in McCracken County which is about 63K total. We also service many surrounding counties in the tristate area.  We are a micropolitan, and everyone comes here to do their shopping/eating.  They bring all their riff raff too. So when the trouble comes it makes the crime rates look disproportionate to the size of the city.  It makes me wonder if this is a typical skewed metric for micropolitan areas.",t2_4djxeqes,SuperWasabi4766,0,1623205022.0,0,t1_h13s93u,h13s93u,True,calleva5688,t3_nvchej,https://www.reddit.com/r/paducah/comments/nvchej/paducah_concerns_and_questions/,Paducah concerns and questions,/r/paducah/comments/nvchej/paducah_concerns_and_questions/h13s93u/,3,r/paducah,0,3

"I’ve never lived there, but I’m walking around the city this past summer I saw plenty of Biden signs and pride flags along side a few Trump signs. It seems Paducah has a good alternative arts scene, but also clearly is still Kentucky. A lot of bios on Instagram of people I met had bible verses. Seems like religion is still very prominent. 

I’ve looked at housing and you can get AMAZING homes there for cheap. Not to mention you’re not too far from Louisville, St. Louis, and Nashville for city trips. Honestly a fantastic proximity to cities I’d love to live within day trips distance from. Not to mention the splendors of southern Illinois hiking.

The food scene seemed fairly lack luster but not horrible. I really liked the specialty coffee shop Pipers and the vibe of the whole coke plant. Freight House is pretty tasty, though not the most amazing small plate food I’ve had. Though their KY carp plate was some of the best seafood I’ve had (in Kentucky of all places!)

I love the old shitty brick/industrial vibe of downtown. I’m a sucker for that. Seems like there’s a lot of events, plenty of nice patios to dine outside, and nice trails to walk on.

"Yeah, Omneya22 is right. This time of year, you’ll start seeing dead yards pop up in a lot of places. Usually they’ll spray roundup on the whole yard and wait a week and then spray again to kill what’s left. In a little while they’ll dethatch it (basically like a tiller that scratches the surface up enough to make room for new seed to fall) and then reseed it all. 

Doing the double roundup spray is basically the only way to get rid of Bermuda grass. If someone came up with a chemical that could kill Bermuda but leave turf alone, they’d be a billionaire tomorrow. 

You have to spray in warmer months when the grass is actively growing.

"Are you wanting to live within the city limits or a little bit outside of it? The school systems are split between Paducah city schools and McCracken County schools. I  grew up in Reidland and where I lived was about a 10 minute drive to downtown and a 20 minute drive to the mall. I’m not sure how much you already know about Paducah/McCracken County but there’s Paducah and then there’s Reidland, Heath, and Lone Oak which are all kind of suburbs of Paducah. Each area has its own stereotype and depending on what you want your kids to be involved in should determine where you live and what school they’ll attend. If you want to PM me I can tell you more.

As for restaurants, there’s tons of good local places. There’s Flamingo Row, Doe’s, tons of Mexican places, 99 buffet (it’s a hibachi and Asian buffet) and tons of others that I can’t think of for some reason right now.

There’s lots of cool things to do in Paducah. We have an annual festival called Barbecue on the River that has amazing barbecue and deserts along with art vendors and live music. We also have the National Quilt Museum, which is cool to check out, but you will want to avoid at all costs on quilt week. Also, traffic will become a nightmare for those two weeks (a week in the spring and the fall) and you should plan commutes accordingly and try to avoid going out otherwise. There’s also the Lowertown Arts Festival, which is kind of similar to barbecue on the river but without the food.

I don’t remember what else you asked for in your post as I’m on mobile and can’t see the OP as I’m typing my reply, but I’ll look again and edit to add more when I can.

"Highlights of Paducah.

Considered the quilting capital of the world.
Has a yearly event called ""Barbecue on the river""
Had one of the first school mass shootings in the US.
The river. It's in a flood plain.

General 
There are lots of apartments for rent in Paducah, shouldn't be a hardship for you to find something suitable. And the rent would definitely be less than $1500 for a three bed. Some of the apartment communities do events together as well.
Food - Walmart and Kroger are the big grocery stores here and there are smaller ones too although ethnic diversity of food products  is poor. There are two Mexican grocery stores and two artisan style stores. There is also a unique store that has a wider range of items and does meat processing. There are farmer's markets and a local farm has produce every so often at stalls at different parts of Paducah
Locations - Paducah, Reidland, lone oak, West Paducah - depending on whether you like big town living  our small town living there is something in those areas.

E-town is the rich end of the base's (Ft. Knox) population, which is right next to Radcliffe which is the base town.

Paducah is the largest city between St. Louis and Nashville. It's 2½ hours either way to get the ""city"".

"That list needs to be updated, Italian Grill and Burrito Shack are closed. 

1. Donuts: Munal's > Red's
2. Burgers: 
   1. Bob's Fiesta Burger (or dog, if you're into that sort of thing) has been a Paducah staple for like 70 years.
   2. Just Hamburgers is a more recent addition. The specials get pretty wild.
3. If you are getting breakfast, just do it at Gold Rush. Unless donuts, then see #1.
4. Pizza: If you need 8 pounds of pizza, Pizza By The Pound is your best option. Put the honey on the pizza for magic. I used to be a firm believer that Fat Moe's had a good Chicago style pizza but I haven't had it since the change in ownership. If New York style is your thing, Italian Village or Michael's, they're pretty much exactly the same.
5. the freight house: The Chef and owner of Freight House is currently on Bravo's ""Top Chef."" Be sure to check the menu online as it changes and check on reservations. With Top Chef going on they seem to have been pretty busy lately.
6. BBQ: Starne's (not D. Starnes), is going to be your best bet. If it was a couple of months later I'd suggest Starne's and Knoth's. 
7. Beer: I like the beer at Beer Werks over Dry Ground. Everything at Dry Ground seems to be hopped. And I like a hoppy beer. The DG guest taps are usually top notch though.

Managed by Cafaro Company, the mall includes more than 90 inline stores, as well as regional radio station Rock 98.3 WJLI. Its anchor stores comprise JCPenney, Best Buy, Elder-Beerman, a Dillard's store divided into two sub-stores, and Dick's Sporting Goods.

"I tried using the Wayback Machine(archive.org) to get any pictures from kentuckyoaksmall.com , but most of the pictures were deleted. What I did find out was that the name of the theater was Kentucky Oaks Theater and it was closed sometime in 2002.

From the research I gathered, Old Navy began being built between February 25, 2004 - April 04, 2004 and finished sometime between August 03, 2004 - November 24, 2004.

If you have any pictures from before 2002, you might be able to find something.

"I remember coming to Paducah from Saint Louis when I was in 4th grade (in college right now) to stay the weekend for my brothers soccer tournament and the team and family members were staying at the executive inn. 

I remember seeing the hotel and thinking “uhh. What?” As I thought it looked like some warehouse from the outside. It was going to be my first time staying in a hotel and I was extremely underwhelmed. My parents ended up checking it out and we immediately went to the front desk and checked out to go to the Courtyard because of how outdated/smoke smelling our room and the hallways were. 

I moved to Paducah about a year and a half ago and I’ve been fascinated with the hotel for some reason. I was really disappointed when I found out they tore it down to replace it. I thought that maybe they were going to replace it with something similar.... nope. A Holiday Inn :(.

"That is a great story... I was born here in Paducah in 1984 and remember the ""big E"" being popular when I was a kid. I only went there a few times, but I too remember that musty gross smell. A couple people I knew had parties there in middle/high school and I went to support my high school boyfriend in a swimming competition in the early 2000s, but it went downhill soon after that. Fun fact, Chip Wynn motors bought the illuminated ""E"" after the place was demolished and now uses it on his lot as a ""W."" I did a quick google image search and put the results below... enjoy!

"""The European Cafe"". It had been in a few places downtown and by Williams Construction. The owner's wife ran off with another German man in town about 2006. He was telling me about it with tears in his eyes the last time I was in there the same year. Talk about sad...

That was when it was next to Hank Brothers in Lone Oak.

My landlord generally requires a $50 deposit per pet but worked with me and my two kitties ;) Timber Village apartments on New Holt Road.

"Good luck. I had to move here for work a few years ago and literally, any thing that met my needs refused to allow any pets of any kind. That included houses, split houses, private apartments, and owned complexes. It was ridiculous. They all had different reasons, that often contradicted themselves. I would ask and they pretty much all agreed they did it because of what the market could handle. I go lucky and found a place a nice house that rented for about half the cost per square foot as others. I feel really lucky. 

I found a lot of good leads for houses and privately owned stuff on Trulia and Zillow. They even had some stuff that are the bigger complexes. I know this doesn't answer specifically, but it helped me find things that were privately owned, which I prefer.

That said, Paducah has now added a lot of rental property, maybe another 4 to 5 hundred units scattered about so you will have some luck, especially if you are willing to pay pet rent, which should be illegal, but I'm biased. I have noticed the newer complexes like Liberty Point, and a couple of places around the mall have relaxed the pet policies that I ran into a couple of years ago because of competition.",t2_8beza,evilcarl,0,1497881630.0,0,t1_dj3u25h,dj3u25h,True,[deleted],t3_6i3dv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/paducah/comments/6i3dv2/pet_friendly_rentals/,Pet friendly rentals,/r/paducah/comments/6i3dv2/pet_friendly_rentals/dj3u25h/,3,r/paducah,0,3
