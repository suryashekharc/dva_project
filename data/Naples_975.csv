"Narrative Coffee Roasters is great! They are locally owned also have their whole bean coffee available in-shop. I have only been to the one at Mercato, but they recently opened a second location. Kunjani (near Waterside Shops) also has incredible coffee and supports charitable organizations and missions. It was founded by a mother and daughter team from Zimbabwe. They have a big selection of coffee and artisan goods/artwork for sale as well. Bean to Cup Coffee Lounge is not as good as the other two (in my opinion) but I think it‚Äôs worth the try and certainly better than Starbucks!

"I totally agree with the idea of taking a class or two, plus consider volunteering at the Botanical Gardens or the zoo (or anywhere that captures your interests).

"Your story is your perspective. Having known women from 20-60 I will say this, after 30 single women are NUTS lol (there's a reason they've been looked down upon for all of human history... We're clearly not evolving but devolving and everyone used to know that and know WHY). 

I have heard and confirmed everything from lies about dead husbands (to ingrain sympathy), to women lying to the cops on abuse and assault charges because a new fling wouldn't commit, to a 55 year old woman explain she LOVED HER EX AND DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD and seconds later confess she cheated on him. 

Odds are a) you've had the best you'll ever have and b) you're going to be single the rest of your life... (Like literally statistically). But you're gonna be that exception? 

The problem with women is they never date down, regardless of their circumstances. An older man is happy to date a retail worker and doesn't care if she brings in the big bucks. But if you've had a millionaire you expect one, and will never settle. A fling or a guy to lay? Sure, easy - virtually any woman can open an app or go to a bar and get laid, but that's the measure of a man (who he can lay)...

"Car washes are the worst thing for your car and touch free is no good as well. They use really strong chemicals to ‚Äústrip‚Äù the dirt off but it also removes the wax or sealant as well leaving you unprotected. Plus I‚Äôve seen them cause plenty of damage to cars. I own a high end detailing business in Naples and also a rep/trainer for a big detail and body shop product manufacturer. If you don‚Äôt mind doing it yourself look into Optimum No Rinse and Shine. There are quite a few videos on YouTube that show you how to do it. It‚Äôs a rinseless wash, not waterless, and it‚Äôs so easy and fast to wash your car. The best part is that you can do it in your garage out of the sun and minimal water gets on the floor. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how ‚Äúfancy‚Äù your car is, it‚Äôs all paint at the end of the day.

"It would probably be better to understand your physical ability and comport levels in self-defense.

Brazilian Ju Jitsu is fantastic for rape prevention because you get so close, but it is very physical and may not be practical for every body type. If you are uncomfortable training with a man between your legs‚Ä¶ find somewhere else. If you are ok with the space, Third Law has had great women‚Äôs class options. 

MMA and Muay Thai Kickboxing teach really practical striking and Kicking Technique. It is really physically intense and a great investment in yourself. Inferno MMA would be a great place to check this out.

If you are looking for a one-off workshop, check with some of the Tae Kwon Do Schools‚Ä¶ They will periodically host workshops that are focused  specifically on self defense.

The best way to avoid becoming a victim though is through awareness and mindset.

HOWEVER! First talk with your landlord, chances are they are considering bumping up your rent, if they are negotiating with them to reduce or even eliminate the possibility of a rent increase, e.g. extending your lease to guarantee them a steady flow of rent in the future.

"It's pretty good, very active, and easy down here.

I've already done quite a bit of biking and did a 65 mile (104 kilometers) loop last year from Naples to Bonita Beach, up to Fort Myers Beach, to Down Town Fort Myers, and back (I'd recommend if you do this stick with the beach route, taking Metro parkway back was a horrible experience)

Personally, I don't use bike lanes unless I need to, I try to keep as much distance as possible between me and 2 tons of metal flying down the road at 50 mph.

I haven't gone from the airport to Marco Island, but I'd bet it is absolutely feasible. A loop from the Airport to Collier Seminole State Park to Marco Island and back up to the Airport would definitely be a cool bike ride, maybe not the best along the 41 though.

\-I like the beach at Lowder Milk Park, though Clam pass is nice too (there's a parking fee of charge if you walked, biked, etc.). Delnor Wiggins Pass is also very popular, though it isn't my favorite. 

If you're up for a long drive and want a quiet place, Lover's Key is a fantastic place. The currents around the island can be pretty strong, so that's one thing to watch out for. I highly recommend going here if you're fine with the 20-mile drive and entrance fee (I think it's five dollars).

\-For hiking, there's CREW Flint Pen Strand and the Sabal Palm Hiking Trail. If you're up for a long drive you can also hike the southern terminus of the Florida Trail from Tamiami Trail. The trail is often flooded, but being that we're entering our dry season hopefully, it won't be.

Crew Rookery Swamp is also a very beautiful spot, especially at Audubon Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary (reservations required online). There's also a nice boardwalk and trail at the south entrance on Shady Hallow Blvd that's free. Either way, you have a good chance of spotting otters here.

\-For restaurants, I highly recommend any Italian Restaurant in downtown Naples, especially Alberto's. If you like Mexican food I recommend Taqueria San Julian or if you end up in Bonita Springs I recommend El Gran Loco Taco. If you want something more high end the Turtle Club and The Bay House Restaurant are good.

\-Among other things I highly recommend visiting Tin City, Palm Cottage, and Naples Zoo.",t2_6wgzeiqo,Snoo_46631,0,1646840661.0,0,t1_hzzewk0,hzzewk0,True,the_boymom,t3_t9f7wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naples_FL/comments/t9f7wa/vacation/,Vacation,/r/Naples_FL/comments/t9f7wa/vacation/hzzewk0/,2,r/Naples_FL,0,2

"I tried to get tires on my car and had about a half dozen appointments at Tire Kingdom.  They never could deliver.  I drove 45 minutes to a store that assured me they would take care of me.  With a 1pm appointment they told me it would be done by 6pm.  I couldn't wait which is why I made an appointment.  The manager came out and looked at my tires and during that conversation I said it looked like he had a labor problem.  He responded it was a payment problem - he said the company pays so little the techs won't come to work.  Another Tire Kingdom store in Bonita closed at least temporarily while I was trying to get my tires done.

I went back to my regular mechanic and they took care of me right away.  I may have paid a little more, but I had more confidence in the job they did and they got it done.

"Not sure about a justice of peace. But, just a few thoughts. Make sure you complete a Florida pre-marital course (which can be done online). Otherwise, there is a 3-day waiting period after issuance of the marriage license before you can get married.

As for who can marry you, that can be any regularly ordained minister or clergy, any judicial officer (e.g., a judge or retired judge), a clerk of the circuit court, or a notary public of the state.

"Good for you! Doesn't change the fact that this advocacy group should have linked, or even at a minimum NAMED, the bill in question.

This bill is about net metering. Net metering means solar owners can sell their excess energy back at the retail rate the utility company charges other customers for that energy. That means utility companies don't make any money off of that excess energy, so energy prices for non-solar owners increases. That's why this bill proposes a step down process.

"Does she have a beach pass and/ or is able to walk a bit?

 I like to park on 33rd street off of Gordon Drive. If there are no spots here try 32nd street. Only park here if she has a beach pass or they will ticket you. You can always have someone drop you off here too. The beach is not crowded here at all because of the lack of parking spots. No bathrooms just FYI.

Plop your stuff down and enjoy the peace and quiet. If shes mobile and you want to experience a slice of actual heaven, walk down 1 mile to the end of the beach (this is Gordon's pass). You will be walking in the opposite direction of naples pier (you will be able to see the pier, but far down). Walk until the beach ends. Very calm water, beautiful shells, hardly any people. It's a bit of a walk so don't go if she has mobility issues. Bring some water, sunblock, and maybe a shirt to wear because the sun can beat down on you.

"I went to AAMCO Transmissions & Total Car Care in Bonita. Had a transmission issue that the dealership told me I needed a new transmission for... and that it would cost $3200. From the symptoms and what was stated in the recommended service bulletin, I knew it didn't need a new one, so I went looking for transmission shops. They took their time to listen to my symptoms and what I thought the issue was, then looked themselves. From the error codes in the car's computer as well as driving it around, they recommended replacing parts of the transmission as stated in the service bulletin. The work only took a day and a half, and after completion, the car drives and shifts as it should. The work was just under 1k for the replacement of the selinoid pack and wire harness, as well as the transmission fluid. The only issue is that they accidently filled the transmission with a quart too little of oil. I went back, they filled it and retested it for free. Transmissions can be tricky to gauge the level, so I don't fault them for it.... just keep your eye on it lol.",t2_1h5bg76j,archermm,0,1646077668.0,0,t1_hytgvtx,hytgvtx,True,majtophat,t3_t3naz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naples_FL/comments/t3naz2/need_a_mechanic/,Need a mechanic,/r/Naples_FL/comments/t3naz2/need_a_mechanic/hytgvtx/,5,r/Naples_FL,0,5

"You might be to able to afford a house in that area if you have the down payment, but, like others said, the commute into town during season is a nightmare as all of the things to do in Naples are east of Orangetree lol. Also, a lot of those houses out that far are not on city water so you‚Äôll have to maintain a septic and well, which sucks. Plus if they ever bring city water out that way, you‚Äôre looking at something like 30k out of pocket to hand over to the city for cost. Some of the HOAs in Naples can be pricey so check those as a lot of new communities being built have HOA fees. 

In general though, That area is okay, there aren‚Äôt really many bad parts of Naples, which is why it‚Äôs one of the hottest cities to move to, but it‚Äôs definitely less desirable due to its location. It‚Äôs building up more as people move to that area because of its affordability relative to the rest of Naples.

You can get more for your money in Cape Coral if you want a nicer home.

"A lot of lots in Naples are 1.12, 2.5, and 5 acres. Most finished lots have flooding in the back half of the property. When they build houses they need to be elevated per code. That fill dirt for a 2000sq ft house will add a little over $20k to the price of building if it needs to be trucked in. So they take that dirt from the back of the property to save that money. On the 1.12 and 2.5 acre lots this creates a sizeable low area in the back half of the property. Definitely still check the flood map if you plan to buy something already complete. Don't worry about it if you don't mind the standing water. Some key things to look for when buying a home is whole house ro/di if on well water, whole house fan, metal roof would be a plus. If you buy a house off everglades expect traffic on that road to pick up when they inevitably connect it to the highway.

I own a lot up against a large drainage canal that is parallel to Desoto. There is an easement on the lot and you can't build permanent structures in the easement. You could still dig yourself a little ramp and kayak or fish in the canal. The canals vary in width and depth though. The one on my lot is about 6 highway lanes wide and fairly deep. Others may be only 2 lanes wide. Also use the flood filter on realtor to get an idea if the lot is dry. My 5 acres is completely dry and doesn't require wetland mitigation credits.
