"I was one of the girls that had inappropriate contact with an appleton teacher.

I don‚Äôt hate the members, I think it‚Äôs exceedingly valueable to have unions (when they actually care about the workers over the companies that sponsor them) but I‚Äôve personally never seen a union help a person that should have been helped.

"Just talked to a higher up there. They have been told they will be exploring early retirement packages for those affected, and are considering opening up the west side plant to be a union choice environment. 

Of course, the union won‚Äôt allow union choice, but it‚Äôs not like they are just telling the union to fuck off, which would be how I would handle it if I was in charge of the changes. 

Unions no longer serve the workers. They serve the companies that sponsor them and the Democratic Party. In 2016 over 35% of union dues from the day street plant went to democratic candidates. I know three people that specifically left the union and were moved to a different plant because of it. 

Anyone who promotes unions now is either Ill informed on the truth behind them, or understands that Unions have changed their focus in the last 40 years, and support that change.

Some recommendations: walk through the Titletown District (it is the off season but the restaurants are cool). Hinterland Brewing has great food. 

Even if you‚Äôre not a sports fan, the Packers pro shop is a must-see and is free to visit. Tours of Lambeau are under $20 and give you a behind the scenes look of club level seats, the rooftop, etc. 

Downtown Green Bay has a really nice historic district called the Broadway district with shops and restaurants ranging from casual to higher end. Downtown De Pere is cute to walk through, too, and has a great chocolate shop called Seroogy‚Äôs. 

I second what the person said about taking a drive up to Door County. Drive up to Sturgeon Bay and check out the downtown area around 1st and 2nd Street, lots of independent shops.

"So for those wondering:

  
I just searched and this is a screenshot of the Democratic Party of Brown County spring election voter guide, found [here](https://brown.wiscdems.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spring2022VoterGuide_web.pdf).

  
At the bottom of the voter guide it says this:  
*Does not reflect an official party endorsement. List includes members and non-member leaders in select contested races. Compiled using publicly available information. Candidates have not given their express permission to be included. Omission from this guide does not necessarily mean the candidate is a conservative. (I) means incumbent. Opponents with red flags have known Republican affiliations. Two red flags means the opponent has demonstrated support for the Big Lie.*

From the article: *The county Democrats based their claims on the outcome of a City Council* [resolution last May expressing confidence in how Green Bay ran its 2020 elections](https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/2021/05/04/green-bay-city-council-backs-resolution-support-2020-elections/4948149001/)*.

"Received this a few days ago and was concerned after seeing the disclaimer:

This was a poorly designed and executed piece that implies a lack of organization and oversight. Coupled with the city's typographical mishaps, this is not a good look. To the Brown County Dems, **get in front of this quickly** before the extremists somehow shoehorn this into their ongoing narrative of being slandered and victimized.

"Like I said, save your energy for those real  conversations. If you're truly an independent and value objectivity, you'll find that the right is taking this county in the wrong direction. Conservatives I admire held to values that no longer seem to matter - accountability, liberty, small government to name a few. Your billionaire class? These are manufactured by GOP policies that preserve wealth in that tier. Yes, the Dems are weak when it comes to Wall St. demands - we've seen this. Look at the education policies the GOP have espoused - how their budget cuts have killed public schools while siphoning money into private (mostly religious) schools. 

About two-thirds of independents dislike Biden because he isn't leaning far enough one way or another. That's another issue but one that implies ""independents"" aren't as much so as they claim. That middle third is going to hold their breath until the Presidential election. How does this affect local votes? In the local primaries, we saw progressives winning and seditionists lose. We'll see more of them lose in April because ultimately more people see the danger of electing traitors as worse than candidates who value a good education, voting accessibility, and a clean environment. 

In all seriousness, enjoy canvassing.

Did Biden cause inflation? Not entirely. While his relief packages added money to the economy, that money was needed to prevent families from falling further into poverty.

Please go ahead and canvas. That's great. I hope you have genuine, authentic conversations (because doing this sort of thing on social media isn't conducive to anything productive). And I hope you listen because you clearly haven't put in the legwork to dig beyond Fox News talking points.

Foods prices are up 5-50% nation wide.

Personally, I didn't think Redwood Inn was worth the 2.5 hour wait, and I think Perch is low-quality in terms of flavor, so a few other options on here I am not big on. St. Brendan's Inn has good fish & chips, otherwise, I really like the Walleye at Rocky Z's!

"All of the hotels are safe. The newest properties are Lodge Kohler, Springhill, Home 2, and MyPlace. Lodge Kohler being the highest level. Hilton Garden is about 20 years old, but updated. Older properties, from the 60s or 70s, are Best Western, and Days Inn. Both are dated, but maintained well, also literally next door to Resch. If you want to save some money look a little further away from Resch. I personally would avoid extremely low price places like Motel 6, and Super 8.

Complaint: Green Bay woman dismembered man‚Äôs body, placed head in bucket  


  
GREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - Officers found a severed head in a bucket at a home on Green Bay‚Äôs west side and body parts in other locations in scenes reminiscent of a gory horror movie.

  
Taylor D. Schabusiness, 24, is charged with 1st Degree Intentional Homicide, Mutilating a Corpse and 3rd Degree Sexual Assault. A court commissioner set her bond at $2 million cash at a hearing Tuesday afternoon. Schabusiness seemed calm when she appeared in Brown County court via video conference. She said very little, only acknowledging that she has the right to an attorney.  


  
The prosecutor called this ‚Äúone of the most serious offenses we‚Äôve had in this county in some time.‚Äù The state argued Schabusiness has ties to Texas, raising a concern she‚Äôs a flight risk. The prosecution also said Schabusiness was on put on probation 7 weeks before the crime and supposed to be wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet but apparently removed it somehow.  


  
‚ÄúI think the facts alleged are extremely concerning and disturbing and go to the violent nature and grave nature of the offense,‚Äù Assistant District Attorney Caleb Saunders said in court.  


  
We first told you last Wednesday about a suspicious death investigation underway on Green Bay‚Äôs west side on the 800-block of Stony Brook Lane. The criminal complaint goes into detail, saying on Feb. 23, at about 3:25 A.M., police were called to the home by a person living there who reported finding her son‚Äôs severed head in a bucket.

  
The woman told police she heard a door slam between 2 and 3 A.M., waking her. She went to check on a light left on downstairs and made the gruesome discovery.  


  
Dried blood was found on a nearby mattress.  


  
Police learned that Taylor Schabusiness may have been the last person to be seen with the victim, identified only as a 25-year-old man. They found her at a home on Eastman Avenue. She had dried blood on her clothing.  


  
Police searched Schabusiness‚Äôs van and on the rear passenger seat. They found a crock pot box with ‚Äúadditional human body parts including legs,‚Äù according to the criminal complaint.  


  
Police obtained a search warrant for the home on Stony Brook Lane, which belonged to the victim‚Äôs mother. In addition to the human head, they found a ‚Äúmale organ‚Äù in the bucket. They found ‚Äúbody fluid‚Äù and knives.  


  
In a storage tote, they found an upper torso.  


  
Police interviewed Schabusiness and asked her what happened. She replied, ‚ÄúThat is a good question.‚Äù Schabusiness said she and the victim were together all day Tuesday and had been smoking meth. After they arrived at the Stony Brook home, they were having sex and incorporated chains. Schabusiness said she blacked out during part of it but just went ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and started strangling the victim.  


  
Schabusiness told investigators she did not mean to kill the victim but she enjoyed choking him and continued to do it. Prosecutors say the sexual assault charge is for acts that happened after the victim died.  


  
‚ÄúSchabusiness responded that the police were going to have fun trying to find all of the organs as she dismembered the body. Schabusiness stated all of the body parts should be in the basement. Schabusiness stated there should be a foot or a leg in the minivan. Detective Graf asked Schabusiness what she did with the head, and Schabusiness stated she had put the Victim‚Äôs head in a black bucket and put a blanket over it,‚Äù reads the criminal complaint.  


  
The complaint continues, ‚ÄúSchabusiness stated she used knives that she obtained from the kitchen of the residence and that a bread knife worked the best because of the serrated blade. Schabusiness stated the knives should be in a black bag along with the body parts in the basement. Schabusiness indicated that she would use whatever bags she found in the basement to place the body parts into. Schabusiness made the comment that at one point, she did get paranoid and lazy and that she thought it was the ‚Äòdope‚Äô that was making her paranoid.‚Äù  


  
‚ÄúSchabusiness stated the plan was for her to bring all of the body parts with her but she got lazy and only ended up putting the leg/foot in the van and she forgot the head,‚Äù reads the complaint.  


  
Police, forensic teams and the Dane County Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office investigated and processed multiple locations associated with the crime.  


  
Police met with the victim‚Äôs family Tuesday. Officials have not released the victim‚Äôs name but are asking for privacy for his family.

> The centered disc represents the sun rising over the horizon of Lake Michigan, as seen while looking East from the shore of the city. The sunrise symbolizes hope and a new day. Universally, the color white represents peace and unity. To many Milwaukeeans, this color has also come to symbolize our long winters.
> 
> The three stripes in the sun's reflection represent the founders of Milwaukee and its three original settlements: Kilbourn Town, Juneau Town and Walker's Point. Their light blue color symbolizes our three rivers: Milwaukee, Menomonee, and Kinnickinnic.

I was expelled as a kid, in the very early aughts, around 2001. It was a complicated, stupid situation where I was threatened with a gun so I gave all the methylphenidate I used to be on to some kids I thought were my friends. When they got caught, they said I gave it to them and so I was expelled for the remainder of the year for ""not coming forward."" I went to a special school for kids with mental issues who got expelled, and kids who were removed from that school were referred to rawhide. Several kids there had been to rawhide before and said there was sexual abuse and physical abuse taking place there. a quick googling supports that not only was sexual abuse documented a while before that, [but also that they are extremely anti-LGBTQ.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawhide_Boys_Ranch#cite_note-46)

"Van Rite charged us 5K four years ago for a typical residential house 40 feet from the street. Our house had the original clay pipe sewer that had joints about every 4 feet. Van Rite uses an interesting method called pipe bursting. The advantage is they don't have to excavate a trench through the entire yard. Instead, they dig a hole inside your basement to expose the interior sewer line, then dig another hole at the street where it meets the municipal sewer line. A cable is then inserted into the old sewer pipe, and that cable pulls a new flexible plastic pipe through the old one, using it as a conduit to guide the new plastic pipe and ""burst"" apart the old clay one. They also pulled a new 1"" Pex fresh water supply line at the same time to replace our old galvanized supply, as well as installed a sewer backflow valve in the basement, which is standard for modern homes (the insurance companies also want to see this). The whole job was done in a day from 7am to 6pm.

It is expensive, but our concern was that it could have been *more* expensive given the 100-year old age of our house. The continuing root blockage problem was annoying. But if that old clay sewer pipe ever collapsed, we wouldn't have been able to use their pipe bursting method. Then we would have had to excavate a trench, which would have also meant paying to remove the huge tree in the front yard causing the problem, as well as probably disassemble some or all of the front porch. We chose to do it as a proactive project, rather than waiting for it to become an emergency, which no doubt would have added to the cost.

In hindsight, the only thing I probably would have done different is to have done it when we first bought the house, and wrapped the cost into the new mortgage at that time.",t2_98ids,lemming_follower,0,1645974854.0,0,t1_hyngn49,hyngn49,False,nightwing185,t3_swe085,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/swe085/emergency_plumbers/,Emergency plumbers?,/r/GreenBay/comments/swe085/emergency_plumbers/hyngn49/,2,r/GreenBay,0,2

Allouez is what I call east Ashwaubenon because they're separated by the Fox River. Theres an awesome park call Voyager Park, a bigass field for sports and also fishing too. Alouez also have a Catholic college called St. Norbert. The only thing is theres a prison near by..

"First welcome to the Green Bay Area. I‚Äôm a lifelong resident (51 years old) and I‚Äôve lived in the areas where some people have told you to avoid. My son and sister live on the west side near West High School and both have beautiful old houses and have wonderful neighbors. Also they paid great prices for these houses so not sure if you‚Äôre looking for bargains. I live in the Astor neighborhood which is east side of downtown and love it as well. Lots of old houses loaded with character. My kids all went to public and private schools so if you‚Äôre not happy with the GB public schools you have options.(when you have kids.) my sister mother and in laws all
Live in Allouez a nice area as well. Went to college in DePere and again a great area. One area that others didn‚Äôt mention is Howard and Suamico. So basically you have lots of options as I think we have a great area and I think the people here are great. Like everything nothings perfect but Milwaukee, Madison ,CHicago and even Minneapolis are not far away for the big city experience. Also our neighbors to the south of us like Appleton and the rest of the Fox River Valley have lots of nice things to do. Lastly while all these areas we‚Äôve been talking about are great options we‚Äôve been house shopping with our son and I was amazed how hard and competitive it was to find one and we were specifically looking for a older starter house in the ‚Äútough‚Äù neighborhoods.

"In terms of East vs West De Pere, they‚Äôre both nice suburban areas, with a few main differences:

East De Pere is primarily residential, with the exception of the downtown area along the river where most of the shops and restaurants are located. As you get to the fringes of town, it bleeds into farmland and new subdivisions. You‚Äôre close to the stores in Bellevue (target, Costco, groceries, home improvement, restaurants, etc). The biggest plus for East De Pere is that it has excellent access to both the Fox River Trail and the East River trail if you enjoy running or biking. 

West De Pere has St Norbert College and a lot more businesses. There are still nice residential areas in West De Pere, but student housing bleeds into some of the neighborhoods in the city proper. There are a lot more stores and businesses around than there are in East De Pere, which means you‚Äôre closer to amenities but it‚Äôs busier and less peaceful. The outskirts of West De Pere bleed into a lot commercial real estate surrounding highway 41, so it‚Äôs definitely higher traffic, but it also makes it a lot faster and more convenient to travel south on 41.",t2_38m5rd4p,2manyemilys,0,1645745230.0,0,t1_hyb5thr,hyb5thr,True,superzippy1,t3_t0k84k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/t0k84k/just_another_question_about_where_to_live_de_pere/,"Just another question about where to live, De Pere?

"One point of clarification from the post above - Oneida street has a lot on it, in terms of chains. It's where the mall is, and it's where things like Old Chicago, Qdoba, LongHorn, IHOP, etc. are, and then yes you'll eventually get to Lambeau field and a few great sports bars.   
Broadway is where you'll find more of the unique ""city-life"" types of high end restaurants, bars, and unique shops (I highly recommend Slander, try the GunPowder for a unique drink you can't get anywhere else). 

There are places you can rent right on the river near broadway, but honestly I think they are a bit overpriced when traversal in GB is really a none-issue. You can get anywhere in Green Bay in about 10 minutes.   


I've lived in Green Bay (East side), Allouez, and Bellevue. I personally like Bellevue a lot because there's some very nice neighborhoods and most of it is pretty close to basically any store you'll need. I'm a 3 minutes drive from 2 grocery stores, a Target, plenty of quick-eat options, and 3 different home improvement stores.   


Having that all been said, a lot of people prefer the De Pere area, and it has a GREAT park and access to the fox river trail for running/biking. There really isn't much of a difference between the East and West sides. 

Ashwaubenon and Green Bay, from a home-buying perspective have a lot of lower income homes (not that there aren't nice areas though), but if Money isn't an issue, Bellevue, De Pere, or even Hobart and Howard (if you're willing to up that commute to 15-20minutes) have better properties.",t2_abm37,Burdicus,0,1645737638.0,0,t1_hyam5dg,hyam5dg,False,superzippy1,t3_t0k84k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/t0k84k/just_another_question_about_where_to_live_de_pere/,"Just another question about where to live, De Pere?

"Ashwaubenon is pretty much where the ""hot spots"" are. The mall, a bunch of restaurants, basically Oneida st is where most of the big business stuff is, plus down the road into west Green Bay is the stadium district.

DePere has a bit of main businesses on the east and west side of the bridge area, otherwise both sides of the river are pretty nice to live.

"Thank you!  You have no idea how relieved I am having read that.

For some context: my first attempt was at Shifting Healthcare, LLC in De Pere.  They administer the tests in a dedicated office, but unlike any drug screen I've taken before not only did it have standard office fare (standing desk, bookshelf, cubby shelf) a majority of the floorspace was taken up by a fully equipped bathroom stall, complete with toilet and handrails.  I was astounded.

After a few moments of silence, the lady who who performed the test said ""shy bladder? I can step out if that'd help"" at which point she opened the door then returned to her computer -  I could hear her typing even after she claimed she stepped out, if it weren't for the partition I could have reached out and touched her.

Diner - black stone
Upscale bar food - main street bourbon room, hinterland, chefusion, copper state
Steak/upscale best - rivers bend, republic, plae, chefusion, blue 
Italian - angelinas, glass nickel pizza, mangiere (TBD)

The iconic Kroll's West will absolutely up your cholesterol levels, If you are a beer aficionado, Hinterland and Badger State Brewery are both two excellent options in the Stadium District.

"Lived in Green Bay, Madison and Milwaukee over the past 5 years. Green Bay is the least accepting of all the cities I have lived in, though there is a strong Transgender community that has pushed the city to a much better point then when it was when I was growing up. I have been verbally harassed (MTF), and I have had some of the kindest souls in Green Bay.

The most important thing is to find community, because Green Bay is a very clique city, and everyone knows each other by 3 degrees of relation. The Napalese Lounge, though a bar, has been the center of the most recent pushes for equality and recognition, and the surrounding arts district is the most accepting district of the city. All else is okay if you keep your head down, so long as you avoid the Trump Store that never closed on Ashland Ave.

It just sucks that everyone makes it so dangerous to drive over that bridge just because they‚Äôre not paying attention.,t2_awuuw849,vikingcrafte,0,1644850653.0,0,t1_hwwx282,hwwx282,False,vikingcrafte,t3_ssb1xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/,Mason street on-ramp,/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/hwwx282/,7,r/GreenBay,0,7

I lived a block from there back in the mid 80s so we used that ramp a lot back then - and I cannot believe that is still like that today. Piss poor design. There should be a metering light at a minimum there.,t2_ca25qso3,Outrageous_Bass_1328,0,1644849704.0,0,t1_hwwv6hj,hwwv6hj,True,vikingcrafte,t3_ssb1xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/,Mason street on-ramp,/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/hwwv6hj/,14,r/GreenBay,0,14
That on ramp is an accident waiting to happen. I‚Äôd rather pick up Mason at Oneida and go across the river in the left lane or take 172 East bound to cross the river and avoid that awful spot during any busy traffic times.,t2_14xuxw,DragoonAS,0,1644848330.0,0,t1_hwwsj1s,hwwsj1s,True,vikingcrafte,t3_ssb1xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/,Mason street on-ramp,/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/hwwsj1s/,13,r/GreenBay,0,13
Especially given there‚Äôs a sign when they get on the ramp that says ‚Äúno merge area.‚Äù I‚Äôve never understood why Ashland traffic has to join the two lanes but the Broadway ramp is an added lane though.,t2_61q2qh78,babyboyjon768,0,1644847439.0,0,t1_hwwqrdh,hwwqrdh,True,vikingcrafte,t3_ssb1xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/,Mason street on-ramp,/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/hwwqrdh/,8,r/GreenBay,0,8
I've always said people treated that on ramp as a merge instead of a yield. No idea why. I'm pretty sure it's caused more than one accident on that bridge.,t2_333ren40,venersy07,0,1644846774.0,0,t1_hwwpgvt,hwwpgvt,True,vikingcrafte,t3_ssb1xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/,Mason street on-ramp,/r/GreenBay/comments/ssb1xy/mason_street_onramp/hwwpgvt/,9,r/GreenBay,0,9
"Agreed, no one yields like they are supposed to. I was in a very similar situation years ago, someone to my left, someone behind me, and they weren't yielding.
