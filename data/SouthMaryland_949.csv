"Mr. Tire in Waidorf was fine but I only had them mount 1 tire on 1 wheel I brought them by itself. 

Goodyear in Waldorf I also had them mount 1 tire to 1 wheel that I had already taken off for them and it was also fine.

Firestone in Waldorf did $1500 worth of damage to my Jeep. Years ago, but I'm holding a grudge. Fuck them. They did such a shitty job aligning it that they broke some other shit and it took a month to get it fixed at a dealership, and then their regional VP told me to shove it up my ass because I couldn't prove that my vehicle wasn't already completely undriveable when I got there. Also I found out later that they tightened my lug nuts so much more than necessary that when I tried to take them off my locking lug nut *and key* both exploded into a million pieces. The other lugs were tightened to over 400lb-ft which is crazy.

TWP motorsports, if you have an offroad style vehicle, were great.

"Folks, the number of Atlantic Broadband/Breezeline posts is getting pretty high and I may start removing some of them. There are so many cool things in this area and all of the ISP posts are the same rehashed complaints. Yes, there are things to complain about, but having lived across the entirety of the US and have paid for and used many different ISP’s, the issues you are running into are near universal.

If you are having trouble with your internet, the two things you should investigate if you have the money is a dedicated modem and a dedicated WIFI router. Both can be had for around $100-150 a piece and will fix the majority of issues you are having. The rental hardware is truly awful as well as a security risk, so getting pretty much anything from a reputable brand is a good move.

As far as service issues, keep in mind that Metrocast was a tiny operation to start with. When ABB bought them, they basically only changed in name and still operated out of an infrastructure separate from the rest of ABB. With Breezeline so new, I’m guessing you are still dealing with the old Metrocast folks including a single lady answering phones. Ideal? No, but you will get a better response and make change by calling Breezeline directly and complaining (thus wasting their time and being the squeaky wheel) than posting on a very small local sub.

Edit -
If you are having issues that cannot be resolved, file a complaint with the FCC. They are the governing body and can put pressure on the ISP’s to fix things.

https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/115002206106-Internet-Complaints

Also, contact Comcast/Xfinity and try to get internet to your house. Chances are, they won’t offer it, but if enough folks ask, they’ll consider bringing service to your neighborhood.

Lastly, go to the county board nights and ask about getting other ISP’s in the area. Breezeline has a near monopoly in the area and they can put pressure to either fix the issues or bring in more competition.",t2_422fyr7k,electricfoxyboy,0,1645459510.0,0,t1_hxufa7w,hxufa7w,True,GameThinker,t3_sxpix5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/sxpix5/are_you_happy_with_breezeline_atlantic_broadband/,Are you happy with Breezeline [Atlantic Broadband],/r/SOMD/comments/sxpix5/are_you_happy_with_breezeline_atlantic_broadband/hxufa7w/,1,r/SOMD,0,1

"Subs: 
Showtime Deli. Family owned. The owners are absolutely the best people you will ever meet. The staff as well. Great breakfast as well. They have a Reuben Omelet that is awesome if you like Ruebens. 

Asian:
Teariffic for lunch.

Island sushi in Solomons or Lexington Park. Everything is great here.

Wu's Korean BBQ is pretty damn good. Mouth is watering thinking about the Bibimibob (sp? Lol) and Kimchi Cucumbers.

Indian: 
Bollywood is awesome. Used to have a lunch buffet before Covid. Dunno if that is back.

American/Bar food: 
Island Hideaway in Solomons. Everything from scratch. Family owned. The owners are also great people.

OTP Leonardtown. Awesome wings and pizza

Slice House Leonardtown. Really Really good handmade pizza. As close to NY Pizza you will get outside Ny. They also used to have hand made bagels that were also as good as NY bagels. Unfortunately, they stopped making them because it just took too long to make such a great product.

Frontporch Leonardtown. Good upscale food.

Sweet Bay Leonardtown. Excellent Food and Drinks. Upscale. Little Pricey. Worth it for Date night type of thing.

Brick Prince Frederick. Awesome food and taps.

Lotus Kitchen in Solomons. They have a Finnegan Breakfast Sandwhich. English muffin. Eggs. Sausage. Blue Cheese. Grape Jelly. It sounds wierd. I dont like Blue Cheese. I eat two of those things when I go.

Breakfast:
Linda's Cafe is awesome. They have a great food truck too. Think a new Breakfast Food truck soon too.

Seafood:

Courtney's in Ridge. Very local. Very slow. Great local experience. The dad catches the fish. The mom cooks everything from scratch. The spicy crab soup is legit. Great family. 

Pier 450 is next door to Courtneys. Excellent excellent place. Pricey, great date night place. Worth the price tho.

Seabreeze (I think). Wont knock your socks off food wise, but its great fried seafood for the price. It was like $14 for a platter of Fries, hush puppies, fried shrimp, fried clams, crab balls. Think was huge. Great lunch spot, its quiet and on the water. More of a local bar at night and weekends.

Mexican:
Salsa's Leonardtown.
Plaza Tolteca

El Reoncito is the only place with an actual California Burrito. Its great. California burrito most places they just shove quac in a burrito. A Cali Burrito, is a steak burrito with french fries in it. My fav as I was stationed in San Diego for awhile.

El Polo Loco is awesome too. In Lexington Park. Like real good. In fact, I forgot it was there and am gonna go there for lunch today.

Honorable Mentions:
Ogas for asian carryout.

Ridge Market has great pizza but is under reno.

Do Dah Deli

Pax River Ale House

Thai Inter is ok Thai food.

Leonardtown market is awesome. Local craft shop with a beer garden, coffee shop that is excellent and serves excellent sandwhiches, and an excellent ice cream shop. 


Personal opinion: Most of solomons is a tourist trap. The pier is as meh as it gets. Lighthouse is way too pricey for the food. Some of it is good, a lot is meh and way too pricey. Only consistent spot there is Island Hideaway and Lotus Kitchen.

"$1500-1700 range is about right for a nicer apartment. 

The cheaper ones are usually older buildings that can have some pretty bad issues. I lived at the Greens (now called Spark) for a couple years because it was cheap…and it was awful. My heating bills were 2-3 times what it costs to heat my current 40 year old house. It also had electrical issues and crumbling stairs. And when they fixed the stairs, they hired some random crew who did it incorrectly and management blew me off when I reported dangerous welds and fabrication.

One of my buddies lives near Looking Glass and is apartment, also older, has severe mold issues and the sewage backed up into his apartment when the pump went out. 

I lived at Abberly Crest for a year and a half until they put smart locks on every door and forced people to pay for ADT. I had a 3 bedroom for ~$1700/mo with their added fees. The apartments were super nice, but the digital locks pissed me off (me and smart devices don’t really click).

Wherever you pick, ask folks walking around about crime, car break ins, and package theft - there are some places that look fine but sadly have crime and shooting issues. If you aren’t comfortable talking to people, pay attention to the types and state of cars in the parking lots of the apartment complex and nearby neighborhoods which can give a general sense of the community. Also pay attention to how the grounds are kept (litter, weeds, the state of flags on flag poles, broken fixtures)….there are a few pretty bad apartment complexes that have nice looking features but don’t take care of their residents.

"California and Hollywood are the nicer areas closest to PAX and are near a few restaurants and the nicer grocery store. The shopping here is nothing to write home about, but being near Target and the (endless) grocery stores is nice.

Leonardtown lacks the stores, but has more mom and pop shops and nicer restaurants as well as a cool bar called The Rex. The Rex has live music and events pretty regularly. There’s a pretty bad ass pizza joint/bar called Slice House that is cool. Leonardtown also does monthly parties in the downtown that are fun.

Realistically, they are all close enough that you could stay in California and do stuff in Leonardtown, or visa versa, with a 15ish minute drive. You’ll likely be near more work friends in California/Hollywood as there are more apartments there.

Be careful of which apartment complex you apply for if you go that route. A lot of them have started posting rents for cheap but require that you pay for things like cable, trash, and sewer.

"As someone that used to work at PAX for 2 years and has since switched to living and working in the DC area: do not do this.

My partner moved in with me during the early pandemic because there was nothing to do/her roommates were Covid risks, but still commuted to DC for work a few times a week. Her commute was miserable, some days she would be in the car for 4+ hours because traffic. She would have to wake up at like 5AM and drive to work, and wouldn't get back until like 6. I get that you're doing the opposite commute, but still. Someone mentioned base traffic 30 min is not unheard of (which is true in my experience) so you're looking at a 2:30 commute worst case one way.

Ultimately I decided that the area was not for me and found a better job closer to the DC area to do more on my off time and I'm significantly happier with it. SoMD isn't a horrible place, but it wasn't for me  in my mid-20s.

Also, I wouldn't chance the hybrid work schedule at PAX, many of the people there are of an older mindset and may require you to come into the office for ""the camaraderie and experience...etc"" so its a crapshoot if/when you'll work from home or not.

The best thing to do ultimately is find a friend/partner/someone who's couch you can crash on in DC and go up every weekend or so. Post-rush hour traffic to DC isn't too bad on a Friday because people are going the other direction, and some positions at Pax get off every other Friday with CWS so you could drive up on a Friday afternoon/Thursday evening and spend a long weekend there.

If you're REALLY set on being close to DC, I'd consider something halfway so that you're not absolutely miserable in traffic, like Waldorf.

"I did this exact commute for about 5 years, also working hybrid. While it’s not for everyone, it’s not nearly as bad as some ppl try to make it out to be. You’re commuting against traffic in that direction, so while you may hit a couple patches just getting in/out of the city, for the most part it’s smooth sailing. Accidents can ruin that, but that’s true for any commute, and in my 5 years it honestly didn’t happen all that often. 

I passed the time with audio books and podcasts or catching up with family on phone calls. There are still days where I actually kind of miss it. The quiet drive was a nice way to settle into work or unwind afterwards and it’s a good time to just reflect or think anything over. To each their own, just wanted to provide a different perspective from someone who’s actually done it.

"A hybrid schedule depends on what you are working on at the time (if you can do it at all). Assuming you are to be working on DoD projects (you mentioned PAX and that is all we do here), know that nature of many efforts requires you to work from certain spaces for security reasons. While you might be able to work from home on the project you start out with, there is zero guarantee that the next one will let you a year or two from now.

For me personally, no - I’d prefer to live closer. There are places like Leonardtown that are a bit nicer and have a downtown and your drive is only about 30 mins. Granted, it isn’t DC, but it is much nicer than the four or five little towns that blend together near the base.

"I agree. I did a commute like this for several months and it was soul sucking. That is 3 hours of your day with GOOD traffic. An accident can easily turn that into 4-5 hours and accidents are sadly very common.

While there is sure as hell more things to do in DC, the time you spend in a car is time you aren’t at home. That’s time away from your pets, friends, significant others, hobbies, and everything you value daily. Instead, you are stuck in your car, dealing with horrible drivers, and hoping the last audiobook or podcast you downloaded is worth anything.

For me, it made me miserable. By the time I got home, I had time to make dinner, relax for an hour, and then go to bed. The only “good” thing about my situation was that I was on the west coast at the time and the time difference meant that by the time I got off of work, I could call my friends and family to keep me sane on my drive home. 

On top of everything, the cost of living in DC is bonkers compared to even the high end apartments near PAX. With the differences in rent and gas, it would still be cheaper to get a hotel room in DC every weekend than actually live there.

Unless you, u/Ok_Lion_6773, plan on going to bars and fancy restaurants every single night you might be better served living closer to PAX and partying in DC on the weekends.

"Cheers; let me know how it goes.  It has been a while so I do not know any specific groups playing table top RPGs in the area though I have seen games in progress.  I used to run D&D (back in 3.5), d20 Modern, and GURPS, but as I said it has been a while and my old player base has migrated away from the area.  I mostly just tinker with settings and rules for my own interest as late.

I have dabbled in a number of table top wargames though I haven't been in the local scene much.  My main for a while was This is Not a Test, which I played up in Glen Burnie from time to time pre-COVID.  Lately I've picked up a bit of Bolt Action and Infinity, and have a side project putting together Pike and Shot era armies for ""The Pikeman's Lament"".

"Can second High Tide. You might also ask if there are any groups either looking for or open to new members to start with. I think most groups are open to new members, but the specific D&D campaign they are running may not be scripted in a way that makes it easy to add more members.

Before you start asking groups to join, do a bit of research on how the campaigns work. This includes things like character sheets, buffs, battle mechanics, and the like.

"The Dunkirk Walmart was originally slated to be a very large superstore with a garden center! The Dunkirk community fought against it and they had to scale back. It’s so stupid too because the store never has anything you need and they take up half the parking lots with mulch and whatnot in the spring. They should have just let them open the garden center! Folks didn’t want that. (I did). 

Another reason there’s not a lot of big stores here was originally population. While the per capita income is really high in this area, The population doesn’t meet the requirements that most big box stores wanted. TJ Maxx changed that. When TJ Maxx came in they soon discovered a huge profit and realized that despite the population, the profits are here. It’s a no-brainer, if you live in Calvert you have to either go down to Lexington Park up to Annapolis or to Waldorf or Bowie so of course we were all going to shop at the TJ Maxx! The TJ Maxx really open the door for a lot more things to come in but unfortunately a lot of it has been garbage! 

The permitting in this county is also really difficult. That is one of the reasons for slow growth. It’s not just that they want to be difficult but it’s also because this county is uniquely seated in a way that you have entry in the north, but everything west and south are via bridge. This means that in order to expand, the county infrastructure has to be able to hold it. Sadly, it’s NOT doing a great job!

"From an Economics perspective, new businesses don’t necessarily mean new jobs. If an area is already having its needs met, adding more of a same business results in similar businesses losing patronage. Loss in patronage means less money means lost jobs.

Walmart is a business that *can* have disastrous effects on other local businesses. Their buying power and logistics mean that they can sell things for far cheaper than mom and pop shops. Folks trying to save money shop at Walmart instead, the mom and pop shops downsize or close, and then the people that lost their job end up working at Walmart. So while Walmart can claim to “make jobs”, a certain percentage of those jobs were from the folks they displaced. This effect can cause some very massive controversies in some communities and they’ve been denied permits as a result. The only time Walmart makes new jobs that didn’t previously exist is when they build in somewhat rural or suburban areas without many other shopping centers nearby.

When it comes to building multiple of the same business in an area, what the company is trying to do is saturate the market. Their end goal is to make money, so the more stores they have, the more money they take from the competition. This is why you see mattress stores everywhere despite people only needing a new mattress every 5-7 years. Same goes for autoparts stores, coffee shops, pet stores, and grocery stores. People shop at whatever is closest, so if you have a 4 stores and your competitors only have 1, you are going to get approximately 4/5ths of the business in an area.",t2_422fyr7k,electricfoxyboy,0,1642107210.0,0,t1_hsjc2fa,hsjc2fa,False,tragic-apathy,t3_s2hb5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/s2hb5i/calvert_county_question/,Calvert County Question,/r/SOMD/comments/s2hb5i/calvert_county_question/hsjc2fa/,2,r/SOMD,0,2

"Np. I loooathe walmart. My hatred started because of my ex's mom, who worked there for years. She was making like $15 an hour when $7 was min wage. They told her she made too much money and had to be a supervisor.

She was like 70 and could barely drive. So they told her she had to go to some training 3 hours away. She tried and ended up quitting. They essentially tricked her into quitting.

They rehired her at minimum wage, because she had quit.

A company that makes $9B in profit should not be doing shit like this. A company making $9B in profit should not be raising health insurance costs so that employees cant afford it.

Argh... I could go on and on about Walmarts bullshit. 

Aldi is awesome tho.

"You would think, however it is not the case.

These companies need big expensive permits to build and often they need permits that are above standard laws. Meaning they need special treatment to bypass local laws for things like runoff and traffic lights, etc. They often offer big benefits down the road, but almost never pay out.

Walmart is notorious for getting these permits and agreeing to things, only to use their big money lawyers to back out when it comes time to pay up in the future. Often times, even closing the store with a loophole the small community wont notice because they dont have big corporate lawyers, and then opening same store 1 mile down the road in a different township.

Another thing, is Walmart is an massive anchor store. Everything else thrives because of Walmart, if walmart closes up, that shopping center and anything in it, becomes a ghost town, and surrounding communities often go to shit. Leaving the community/locals to pay the bills with taxes.

Walmart is the epitome of corporate greed. They will do anything to make money and save a buck. 

They screw local farmers over and have fought to have laws changed to be able to say ""local produce"" even tho its not really what you would consider local.

Sure they bring some jobs, but its all bottom end retail jobs, and hardly any benefits. Walmart is the largest employer in the US, and has an unbelievable amount of employees on Welfare while bragging about making 9+ Billion in profits. Walmart only has about 50% of its employees as full time, so they cant get benefits. I would wager money that Walmart actually costs a lot more money than they bring in locally.

"So, back in the 80s and 90s, the ""Beach"" was the are for cheaper housing, since the houses were old beach houses and on small lots. The housing boom in the 2000s, had most of the houses flipped or knocked down and a new house or duplexes built. There are still some houses that haven't been redone or still occupied by lower income renters or druggies. But that's like any town area.  


Due to the zoning, outside of the town boundaries, the houses have to be put on larger lots, so, most of the homes outside of the town are on 5 to 10 acre lots. So, those that are attracted to the larger lots, will complain about any noise. My parents have about 10 acres and when they are outside can here when their closest neighbor starts their Camry.  


There are a lot of fair weather dentist and lawyer motorcycle riders with the stereotypical loud HD that go to Traders restaurant for Sunday brunch or Friday happy hour.

Also, North Beach and Chesapeake Beach are the only incorporated towns in the county. There are some towns that are designated by the county, but aren't real towns.  


There is also a lot of small town crap talk about places, and some people act like the hatfields and mccoys, the people that started the shit have long died and the family can't remember why they won't eat at a certain restaurant, but they continue to talk crap.

"I can’t speak for that area, but generally speaking, there is usually a “good part” of town. Drive through the neighborhoods and look at the cars - if you see mostly beat up and neglected cars, that probably isn’t the best neighborhood. Not necessarily bad, but it can give you a general feeling of an area pretty quickly. If you see a mix of new, slightly used, and only a couple trashed cars, that likely is an okay neighborhood.  Also pay attention to folks’ lawns, fences, and house repair as well - places with a lot of renters are typically a little more overgrown and have fewer of the “beautifully manicured” yards. I’ve noticed that in my subdivision, renters aren’t as likely to put in as much money and time into their property. Renters tend to neglect houses which can have a negative affect on the value of a nearby purchased property over 5-10 years.

As far as drug dealers - they are trying to make a living. They don’t want drama and won’t illicit it with folks that leave them alone. They also don’t typically like customers hanging around as it puts them at risk. Is it risk free for you? Nope. There are parts of town where I live (general Lexington Park area) where shootings happen every few months. And unless you decide to stakeout an area or you get a very honest neighbor, you aren’t likely to be able to point one on your own.

The beat thing you can do while scoping places out is to ask neighbors. Watch for folks taking out the trash, walking dogs, doing yard work, etc and ask them what they think of the neighborhood. Ask them if it is peaceful, if they have any issues with crime or the HOA, and if they like it there.",t2_422fyr7k,electricfoxyboy,0,1634084984.0,0,t1_hgf9n99,hgf9n99,True,mranthr0pic,t3_q6v4zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/q6v4zx/opinions_on_moving_my_family_to_the_chesapeake/,Opinions on moving my family to the Chesapeake Beach or North Beach area.,/r/SOMD/comments/q6v4zx/opinions_on_moving_my_family_to_the_chesapeake/hgf9n99/,1,r/SOMD,0,1
"Lived in North Beach for about 3 years. We lived across the street from a known drug house with an alcoholic who would sit outside daily and yell at people walking by so my opinion may be a little biased.

There were plenty of families with young kids playing outside, and they were generally all safe and respectful. Other than the drug house, we really enjoyed staying there. It was nice to walk to the bay. I’m not sure of your budget, but there are a couple of “nicer” neighborhoods in the area (especially Chesapeake Beach) that some would call “safer.” I would say it’s a good mix of all classes of people, and it is becoming more racially diverse.

As for schools, I can’t attest to knowing a lot since we don’t have kids, but the kids in our neighborhood seemed to enjoy the schools. Colleagues of mine whose kids were enrolled in the public schools seemed to not have many issues.

"As someone who grew up here I can tell you the problem is pay. Investors/Business owners are looking to maximize profit why paying the next generation as little as possible. In some cases treating them sub human as well.

Saw this working part time at lowes in California one summer. A lady and her husband demanded to get help in the home renovation section. I kindly told them the best way to get help was to contact the department and set up an appointment. Next, they proceeded to call me lazy and that I should use my radio to call someone. I explained I wasn't wearing one then they said I just lost a sale. As stormed off.

Let me explain something boomers: A part time retail employee making less than $15 an hour doesn't care that your ego makes you think you are bill and malinda gates, no do they have the training to answer your technical questions about what type of plant will live in the sun or die in the shade. You created this cheep at all cost atmosphere by shopping at large discount stores and not wanting to pay livable wages. You reap what you sow.

The issue with the contractors goes hand in hand. It comes down to cost. Why come out and estimate or talk pricing when the numbers don't add up. Further, a lot of these union jobs pay full retirement benefits at a crazy early age then they go solo and unless they can rip off someone they aren't interested in doing the job. You seem to think that the full cost of the job goes right to people's pockets. It's a blah blah cost job guess no one wants my 20k... Yeah minus labor, minus good, minus insurance in case your bitch ass sues, minus etc.

You want people to do this work, but don't understand the next generation is pretty much fucking done being treated as free labor.

"I’d recommend getting a foil stunt kite and mastering that before trying to tackle kite boarding. A good kite will run you ~$100-200 new. You want one that is large enough that it gives you a fair amount of pull, not just any trick kite. It is EXTREMELY important to master kites in gusty winds as it is not uncommon for folks to have fingers and hands ripped off in that sport when they get accidentally tangled in lines.

If you can handle that and you are still interested, contact the local sports shops and ask around. It’s such a comparatively rare sport that the chances of finding on on this little sub are fairly slim.

"The link that you provided shows a 7 day average, not a monthly one. Even if it is the case that no deaths occurred, mortalities follow hospitalization by 10-14 days and the data itself lags by a several days. As July still isn't over, your data set is not complete.  I maintain my reason for comment removal.

While I don't really like the idea of anecdotes as evidence, I am aware of at least one death this month personally. One of my coworker's neighbors died leaving a young kid and a wife behind. When will that be counted and shown on the tracker? I have no clue.

On the mask bit - the mask mandates were lifted for vaccinated individuals because they didn't spread the original virus to the same levels as their unvaccinated counterparts. It has since been found with the delta variant, which is now the dominant variant, that vaccinated people who become infected can spread the virus at the same level as unvaccinated people.

Also, be aware that the DoD is following guidelines set forth by the CDC. The CDC gains nothing from its recommendations and is trying to help our country with the best information they have. At the moment, the information is that the delta variant is so virulent that vaccinated people can still transmit it and that masks lower infection rates. Like it or hate it, that's the current verdict. From the standpoint of the DoD, they want to maintain readiness and capability - they have decided that the guidance from the CDC has strong enough evidence that they are worried they will have loss of life or capability by ignoring the recommendations than to take them.

"I appreciate the conversation.

For the first two (""unknown virus and its characteristics"" and ""constant changing of info and understanding the make up of the virus""): I can understand where you come from. There were a lot of unknowns when we first started out. Were masks useful? Do we need to disinfect surfaces? How virulent is the virus? Can kids catch it? Do only old people die of it? ....there was a lot of back and forth conversation about the virus and how it worked for the first few months. 

However, this is currently one of the most studied and medical issues at the moment and we know a lot more than we knew when the pandemic first started 18 months ago. We understand how it works, who it affects, and how to treat it. We went from a mortality rate of hospitalized people from close to 50% to now around 7%. The medical recommendations, such as masking, changed with what we learned about the virus and how it spread.

The new variants are just that - variants. The mutations that make up a variant are typically relatively minor. They impact things like surface proteins, how many viruses get produced, and usually have minor changes to severity of symptoms. It is unlikely for the method of transmission, types of symptoms, or much else to change. As a result, we can usually say that a variant is close enough to the original virus that we can treat it medically and epidemiologically the same. 

For the next one (""rushed to the market vaccines that were later creating heart inflammations and blood clots""). The vaccines were rushed faster than a typical flu vaccine, but that doesn't mean they weren't fully tested. Pfizer, specifically, had been researching coronaviruses and similar vaccines for decades prior to the pandemic. If you remember, SARS and MERS exploded not really all that long ago - both were coronaviruses. It was assumed that another event like those would happen again, and it did.

On the heart inflammation and blood clots, it was found that those were the result of the people's immune response. When you get a vaccine, it isn't like asprin where it treats the problem and then gets flushed out. A vaccine ""pretends"" to be a pathogen, your body fights it, and then learns to fight an actual illness. Just like how a cold can cause inflammation in your sinuses, lymph tissues, and more, vaccines can do the same. 

For last one ( ""long term problems from these rushed vaccines""), you have a point, but it is unlikely there are longterm risks. In most vaccine studies, it is found that any negative effects are typically seen within the first 5 minutes of getting the injection. If severe side effects are not seen immediately, other side effects may be seen within the first couple days. Anything after a couple weeks is rare to just flukes in the randomness of a human population. Will some people die of something odd after getting a vaccine? You betcha! But that doesn't mean that the ""odd"" thing was caused by the vaccine.",t2_422fyr7k,electricfoxyboy,0,1627676699.0,0,t1_h74iyw7,h74iyw7,False,electricfoxyboy,t3_oualtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/oualtq/masks_required_for_all_on_dod_installations/,Masks Required for All on DoD Installations,/r/SOMD/comments/oualtq/masks_required_for_all_on_dod_installations/h74iyw7/,4,r/SOMD,0,4

"You don't wear a mask to protect yourself, you wear it to protect others. The reason the mask mandates were lifted on those who were vaccinated was because it was believed that they would not be able to spread infection. However, the new delta variant can still be spread by folks who are vaccinated at the same rate that unvaccinated people. https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/wear-face-mask-protect-each-other

So while the risk to YOU dying goes down as a result of getting vaccinated, the risk to others does not.

It is worth pointing out that ""not dying"" is not the only purpose in getting vaccinated. ""Dying"" is not the only negative outcome. With severe respiratory infections comes a high chance of scaring of the lungs which never goes away or gets better. We have also seen a much higher occurrence of blood clots and organ failures as a result of infection that are not always caught which means that you can be ""fine"" when you recover from the virus and run into issues weeks or months later. https://hms.harvard.edu/news/covid-19-blood-clots

"Sorry to hear about your bad experience with Evergreen.

In terms of additional contact information, [this](https://web.calvertchamber.org/Trash-HaulingCommercialResidential/Evergreen-Disposal-1518) Calvert County Chamber of Commerce entry lists one additional contact phone number, and [this](https://forums.somd.com/threads/new-vision-trash-service.185131/post-4360676) post in the Southern MD forums lists an alternate contact for Evergreen Disposal, posted back in 2010, (so that may not be current).

These issues sound similar to ones we had with our trash service when it transitioned from Bob's Trash, to Coastal Trash, back in 2011. I'd actually wondered if there was any connection between Coastal and Evergreen, since the few remaining Coastal customers in our subdivision looked to have transitioned to Evergreen.

Similar customer service issues have been documented online, in the BBB reviews for [Evergreen](https://www.bbb.org/us/md/waldorf/profile/garbage-removal/evergreen-disposal-inc-0241-200503820), the Yelp reviews for [Evergreen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/evergreen-disposal-services-waldorf), and [Coastal](https://www.yelp.com/biz/coastal-trash-annapolis), as well as the YP reviews for [Evergreen](https://www.yellowpages.com/waldorf-md/mip/evergreen-disposal-inc-453691548), and [Coastal](https://www.yellowpages.com/annapolis-md/mip/coastal-trash-476303682).

"Leonardtown Square and the surrounding streets have a lot of nice little shops including some arts and crafts stores, an art gallery, and some fun restaurants. There are also kayak rentals on the water that are reasonably priced.

Point Lookout at the far southern tip of the peninsula is fun to walk around. Know that it is a state park and requires admission fees. 

Solomon's Island is where you'll find most of the higher end places to eat and has a few fun shops. Parking is a pain there, so be prepared to walk and carpool during peak times. The views for some of the eateries are absolutely stunning.

If you like fishing, you could try chicken necking for crab which you can do without a license. You literally tie a piece of chicken (necks, legs, etc) to a string and drop it in the water. When crabs grab it, they hold on for dear life and you can pull them up. Eat or let them go. There are a few public fishing piers around - as long as you don't throw your used bait into the water, you are welcome most places.

An odd but wondeful thing that you should be aware of - one of the best places to get sandwiches here is at a gas station called Wawa. There are a few scattered about.

"Solomons boardwalk is a good spot! There are several restaurants along the way, my personal favorite being Kingfisher's (their cream of crab is just phenomenal). The Pier has the best view, and the Lighthouse has the best selection of crushes (the key lime one is SO good). Lotus Cafe is a good, small spot with relaxing outdoor seating. Island Hideaway's outdoor seating is also gorgeous! They have my favorite fries. CD Cafe has some amazing specials that change regularly, so there's always something new! Ruddy Duck isn't on Solomons Island, but that's my regular spot. They brew their own beer, so if you're a beer lover, you'll need to check them out!! They also have a location at St. George Island which is a bit of a drive (not terrible, honestly), but the view is just to die for. 

I saw someone else recommend Calvert Cliffs and I highly recommend it! Myrtle Point is also a beautiful park with beach access. 😊

"Since you are coming from Kansas I take it you don't get to experience much in the way of forests or cliffs.  I'd say check out the Calvert Cliffs nature trail.  It ends at the mouth of the Chesapeake bay.  You can swim if you want, and you can also find sharks teeth and fossils at the beach.  I haven't been in a while, so I cant remember if you can walk right up to them or not, but there are some pretty good sized cliffs right at the beach that are pretty neat.

Wildwood is beautiful and nice!",t2_4h2eijfe,devoutdefeatist,0,1620773281.0,0,t1_gxsd68m,gxsd68m,True,[deleted],t3_n9weia,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/gxsd68m/,2,r/SOMD,0,2
"Well, until about 2006 my boyfriend lived in what used to be the Queen Anne apartments (not sure if it's still the same name). He had a ground floor unit. Wandering druggies/homeless used to come up and ask for money the few times he was out on his tiny excuse for a patio. Also a hooker tried to climb in his car when he was stopped at a traffic light in the area.",t2_owcq5,insecurecharm,0,1620765171.0,0,t1_gxruq8l,gxruq8l,False,[deleted],t3_n9weia,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/gxruq8l/,2,r/SOMD,0,2
"We own a house in cedar cove.  A lot of people either rent houses or rent townhouses in the neighborhood.  If you are looking more for an apartment complex, spyglass apartments are pretty nice.  Short walk to the beach and still less than a 5 minute drive to the base via gate 3.",t2_m43vu2l,hammburglar0249,0,1620758769.0,0,t1_gxrf4x5,gxrf4x5,False,[deleted],t3_n9weia,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/gxrf4x5/,1,r/SOMD,0,1
Yep! My issue with it was that it was run by ADT which doesn’t safeguard consumer information as well as they should. The locks being accessible remotely is another major problem for me. It really and truly doesn’t take much to hack those.,t2_422fyr7k,electricfoxyboy,0,1620756494.0,0,t1_gxr9lpk,gxr9lpk,False,[deleted],t3_n9weia,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/gxr9lpk/,2,r/SOMD,0,2
"Leonardtown is the only area nearish PAX with a downtown. If bars and restaurants are a big deal to you, check out that area if you can afford it. That is also where the hospital and most doctors are located if that is important to you.",t2_422fyr7k,electricfoxyboy,0,1620756201.0,0,t1_gxr8vwb,gxr8vwb,False,[deleted],t3_n9weia,https://www.reddit.com/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/SOMD/comments/n9weia/deleted_by_user/gxr8vwb/,1,r/SOMD,0,1
