">One of the community groups spearheading the safety improvements is the Aurora Reimagined Coalition.  In their most recent blog entry, the coalition calls out the stretch of  Aurora between North 84th Street to North 110th Street as being zoned for tall, mixed-use buildings that agree with its potential to be a robust commercial core. Despite that, the group notes that Aurora’s seven lanes of traffic make for an uncomfortable and hazardous urban experience, as evidenced by the high number of traffic fatalities in the area.

Those traffic fatalities have more to do with people high on drugs wandering into traffic, willfully ignoring traffic signals, or speeding on meth with their eyes closed and mowing down families standing on the sidewalk than it does with Aurora being an 'unsafe street.'",t2_3cwp4boj,unnaturalfool,0,1647262318.0,0,t1_i0m0jvr,i0m0jvr,True,unnaturalfool,t3_tdwo45,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tdwo45/flush_with_state_dollars_seattles_aurora_redesign/,"Flush with state dollars, Seattle's Aurora redesign emerges: potentially lower speeds, more bike paths",/r/SeattleWA/comments/tdwo45/flush_with_state_dollars_seattles_aurora_redesign/i0m0jvr/,19,r/SeattleWA,0,19

"Ok. I disagree with around 80% of your entire r/seattlewa posts.

I can summarize many of your r/seattlewa postings in an example. Let's say someone makes a post about a doctor performing pro bono care for the homeless in King County. Due to increased gas prices and inflation affecting prices of goods and services overall, the doctor has to reduce their free services by a day, to be able to continue operating the free portion of their practice at all. Your point of view usually sides with the addict who was receiving free care from the doctor and you gloss over any crime they may have committed or personal responsibility for their situation and illness and you focus on the doctor and their privilege. You then might go on to criticize the doctor for not downsizing out of their large house to be able to afford to continue to care for and enable the addict. How'd I do?

"As a recovering addict/junkie (15 months clean) I can say letting people live on the street is not being “helpful”. Letting people shoot up on the street is not “helping”. The only person that can truly help an addict is the addict. If you really want to be helpful, enforce the law. Without consequences most addicts will continue using and that will only lead to death - if you take jails and institutions off the table. I think the real “asshole” move is thinking you CAN help someone get clean by fiddling with gov policies. Enforce the law fairly and consistently is the MOST helpful thing you can do.

"Give context? What do you consider a “clean city” in America? I could compare smaller sized cities I’ve lived in and easily name it cleaner than Seattle… though we’re also talking about cities with metros of maybe 300k to 500k people. 

If you rank Seattle by population, comparative cities would be Indianapolis, Detroit, San Francisco, Portland, Oklahoma City, Vegas, Fort Worth, Denver… all of these cities have well known communities with crime and drug problems, some worse than others (some have much larger metros) but still problematic enough to research if you wish to find out about it. 

Denver may be the cleanest I know of on that list from first hand accounting (if I had to make an assumption). If you want to compare “red vs blue”, that’s a pretty good representation of cities in either, thought that’s a very shallow argument to explain the problems we’re dealing with. Oklahoma is one of the most conservative states listed there and yet has one of the highest substance abuse issues in the country. 

They all share similar issues with the same drugs, the same drugs that are leading to increases in homeless, crime and violence across the country. It’s not radical to say that this may be a wider problem then blaming one city or region of the country… or trying to simplify it to *only* republicans or democrats. If you want to look to the more conservative areas of Washington state (eastward), you’ll see many cities with drug issues. The main difference is areas out there are still affordable enough to rent while feeding an addiction problem.

I’ve lived through out the U.S. and I feel confident saying Seattle is FAR from the filthiest big city in the U.S., once again… research Philadelphia, Oakland, Jacksonville, Newark NJ, San Bernardino CA… and as much as I love it, New Orleans is dirty in many parts, much of it not of it’s own doing but that’s a different conversation.

As far as police enforcement, I agree law enforcement can be too lax in Seattle. The prostitution on aurora still surprises me as much as the first day I moved here and saw it. Though it’s silly to act like prostitution isn’t in every city either. 

The metrics your judging a city by are different than what some may judge a city by. I disagree with your assessment of Seattle in general though, just cruising around today and being objectively honest about the city makes what your saying not agreeable to me. I will totally join in complaining about the awful tagging that happens in the city though.",t2_4za27,starmud,0,1647244022.0,0,t1_i0lcf54,i0lcf54,False,cuteman,t3_td1eb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/td1eb4/citing_safety_concerns_amazon_allows_employees_to/,"Citing safety concerns, Amazon allows employees to relocate out of downtown Seattle office",/r/SeattleWA/comments/td1eb4/citing_safety_concerns_amazon_allows_employees_to/i0lcf54/,1,r/SeattleWA,0,1

">	force them into rehab facilities (illegal)

Technically true, but once a crime is committed, rehab in a psyche ward can be part of the deal. The giant problem in the USA and even more so in WA, is that we simply don’t have the psych ward space, though we (WA) is building more, we need more money in this area. 

>	jail (look down on)

And for good reason. Prison time does not cure addicts, and the prison system and having a record makes it almost impossible to renter society even if they wanted to. 

>	At some point its their problem and only they can fix it.

I would disagree here. While they absolutely instigated the problem (probably), the *problem* becomes societies. And no, they don’t generally have the power to cure themselves. It requires time and resources (which are often offered) and a willingness to be clean, but sadly the drug its self makes the willingness impossible.",t2_3ak3j,EarendilStar,0,1647241743.0,0,t1_i0l9pyo,i0l9pyo,False,baggiecurls,t3_tdo00g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tdo00g/pioneer_square_completely_cleared/,Pioneer square completely cleared,/r/SeattleWA/comments/tdo00g/pioneer_square_completely_cleared/i0l9pyo/,11,r/SeattleWA,0,11

"What really kills me is that, notwithstanding the 22 prior convictions, this guy already had a warrant out for his arrest. So the cops definitely know who he is. And yet he’s apparently allowed to just bop around downtown when he shouldn’t be, so he can randomly assault citizens. Nobody should be surprised by this. The crime was foreseeable and the public servants who tacitly endorse it should be ashamed.

It gets worse. From another article I read, the guy has had fucking FIFTEEN bench warrants for failure to appear in court. Add those in with the convictions and warrant, and you’ve got an arrestable, dangerous man who has shown probably 40 times in his adult life that he doesn’t give a shit about living in line with the law. How much do you want to bet that our judges released him on his own recognizance time and time again?

I just do not understand it. This is wholly different from “criminalizing poverty.” This is not about race, at all. Why in God’s name does the city want this? Why is Seattle not enforcing the criminal code? Why are our judges exercising shit judgment on bail decisions, for people they know will fail to appear?

If I were Bruce Harrell, my orders to the police and city attorney would to be to identify the prolific offenders have active arrest warrants, particularly the violent ones who have a history of failing to appear in court, and arrest those fuckers ASAP. Use the full extent of the RCWs against them. Send them to jail, give them real consequences. Maybe junkies from out of state will stop flocking to Seattle if the word gets out.

"I had tenants that were in that exact position, I let them out early without issue for a few reasons:

- It moved the lease renewal from winter to summer.

- They had always paid on time and took good care of the place. It wasn't an adversarial situation at all.

- I want to encourage home ownership. Buying is stressful enough with having to worry about what to do on your rental side of things.

- Basically there's nothing I could have done if they just left, anyway. The months it would take  to collect from them would be a waste of my time compared to just finding new tenants.

- They'd had the same rent for a few years (I try to keep good tenants) and this was an opportunity to get it closer to market rate.

After all was said and done, they had referred some people they knew professionally that ended up taking the place, so even that worked out in the end.

"Maybe. I see serious intent to harm in him speeding up the escalator to get to her before she is away from the stairs and potentially an attempt to kill in throwing her more than once.

I had understood first degree as this:

(1) A person is guilty of assault in the first degree if he or she, with intent to inflict great bodily harm: (a) Assaults another with a firearm or any deadly weapon or by any force or means likely to produce great bodily harm or death;

I'm not a lawyer, just an outraged person who thinks throwing a person down concrete steps more than once =  ""force or means likely to produce great bodily harm or death"". Maybe the deadly weapon part is the important part of the clause.

I also feel like anyone with a DV history (as they say he has in the article) is a danger to women and this man is literally targeting a woman and it is on video!!!

I would want that person off the streets because they could easily kill someone. If they are ill and need to be in a hospital setting rather than prison, fine. I just expect this to be taken more seriously than apparently it is.

Gig workers technically work for less than minimum wage because each job isn’t guaranteed to pay enough to get to minimum wage. So a few bucks as a bounty for a bag of trash doesn’t seem much different than that.

"Well for 1...im a person of color, who is 40 years old, and live in tacoma now and havent lived in Seattle for a minute now. And my opinion is completely legitimate and everyone who responds to this post with TL:DR or some sterotypical assumptions about blm or protesters is petty much is just admitting they lack any legit counterarguement but dont need one because they are angry white childish king county suburbanites. 

(For the record ive not taken part in any protests and tho i respect the cause, im really not a huge fan of the blm org )

2 I personally have two friends who have been shot by the police, both unarmed. I know a few more who have had the living sh!t beeaten out of them by police (while handcuffed and had to be hospitalized) and know a number of people who have been victimized in various ways including the theft of guns, drugs, money. (I myself have witnessed, not thirdhand accounts but with my own two eyes, saeattle police steal two boxes of money with thousands in cash from these kids throwing a party, saying that they had permits but the improper event permits and seized  the cash no, citation. No ticket, no summons to appear in court, no arrest, no charges filed.....nothing but u guys f#cked up and were taking your money for ourselves and theres nothin u can do about it) so my subjective views of police are fully validated.

3 Subjective personal analysis not being a great arguement to legitimize ones personal views, objectively the seattle police department can be percieved as a ""terrorist"" organization being that after a 2010 dept of justice investigation spd was forced to agree to a consent decree which mandated reforms the dept must make particularly in regards to its use of force policies after a number of people were gunned down by spd officers. The agreement noted that if these reforms were not met, the depts record of abuses was soo egregious that the seattle police would have to CEASE OPERATION AND SHUT DOWN effectively transferring the depts duties to state patrol and king county sherriffs who did not have the staffing to take on the tasks. Included was federal oversight and changes to disciplinary actions made in the agreement which the depts union had overturned once federal oversight no longer monitored the agreement.

So to sum it up it all the people who didnt like my comment are pretty much projecting the fact that they are spoiled childish white people who are angry because people are being mean to the hero cops they worship and anyone who isnt willing to get on their knees and blow anyone in a uniform is somehow a communist unamerican traitor or something like that.

"Hey I live here and was woken up at 4am by the gas leak (of course I’m now going to move). The gas leak was caused by a new boiler installed two days prior. The irony is we had no hot water for a full 14 days prior to the installation of this boiler, and the icing on the cake is that Thrive cut corners installing it which resulted in a child passing out and going to the hospital.

For those curious, in my 24 months at Rooster, I’ve experienced the following:

-	On/off again hot water 4x times, ranging between 1-14 days (yes two weeks)
-	Broken garage door 3x times, trapping me in the garage
-	Packages stolen 4x times
-	Homeless people breaking off the door handle to the entrance 3x times
-	1x car break in
-	Homeless people defecating and shooting opioids on the front patio late at night 
-	My bicycle was stolen from a locked storage compartment
-	Awoken by the fire alarm 6x times in various times of the day, usually late in the evening
-	Extremely loud road noise, windows are not double paned
-	Staff turn over 2-3 times, hard to keep track of any responsibility 
-	Mystery charges on utility bill from third party company management can’t explain
-	Clogged trash chute 3x times
-	Security camera are non functional, purely for vanity 
-	Forced to use third party package delivery service ‘Fetch’ which simply complicates and delays package delivery 
-	Dog feces/urine all over stairwells and parking garage
-	Almost died in my sleep because of the carbon monoxide leak at 4AM (seriously). Fire department said levels were in lethal range on every floor

The larger point is that drug use is plaguing America. Skid row communities fueled by drug use have popped up all over the country. Crime follows. Violence follows. 

This same formula is repeating through out the country, regardless of the tactics used by a city (for example, Vegas has largely given up and now corrals them into one street, in part creating a completely lawless zone). 

Looking exclusively at Seattle, like most cities facing similar issues, there’s no successful formula on how to handle or fix a problem that stems way beyond their jurisdiction. One political side argues social services while the other argues disciplinary action. Ultimately, either require large amounts of resources given the scale of the problem. The inability to meet those needed resources is part of the breakdown we’re seeing. It’s easy to be here discussing what *should* be done, but the reality is a city has budgetary and legal limits. Resources and people power are not unlimited. 

If we look back through the history of various American cities, we see examples of where state and federal partnership was key to addressing the periods of blight in big cities. For example, In the 80’s and 90’s it was crack in inner cities. Today we have much worse substances, but with no cohesive strategy to combat them with economic pressures exacerbating possible fixes. 

As for the ending of your post; young people move into cities and move out as they age. It’s the same story that’s repeated forever. The ex city dwellers complain about the city being an awful and dirty place while sealing themselves away in the burbs. 

If you drive objectively through Seattle, you see for the most part it’s pretty clean (one of the cleanest on the west coast IMO) and safe for a big city in America (I never feel in danger, but I’m also not putting myself in situations where I could be in danger). If you want to see a true American wasteland, see parts of Philadelphia or Oakland. The worst part of Seattle today is Disneyland compared to what you’ll see there.",t2_4za27,starmud,1,1647218473.0,0,t1_i0k5puz,i0k5puz,False,cuteman,t3_td1eb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/td1eb4/citing_safety_concerns_amazon_allows_employees_to/,"Citing safety concerns, Amazon allows employees to relocate out of downtown Seattle office",/r/SeattleWA/comments/td1eb4/citing_safety_concerns_amazon_allows_employees_to/i0k5puz/,3,r/SeattleWA,0,3

"Ah, so debtors prison then?  Because that's what you're arguing for.  If someone has no money to pay a fine, then a fine is useless.  You're way too emotionally involved in this to see logical, rational solutions to a problem.  I want clean streets.  I want people not sleeping in parks.  Fining them is not going to accomplish either of those things.  Throwing them in jail is untenable because we don't have the resources or the space.  Making it hard for them to live by bothering them and sweeping them does seem to work.  Paying them to keep the area clean helps as well.  All are a piece to a larger solution.

Fining people who actually have money keeps them from doing things we don't want to happen. Bribing people to do what we want them to do also works.

We tried to call the police. They don’t show up.

Now we are left to fend for ourselves and protect ourselves but these stupid fucks don’t listen to, “please stop”.

The only language they understand is violence and with violence we respond.

If you don’t want to see more poor innocent criminals shot in the face for stealing then perhaps you should allow the budget for the police force to be increased so we can hire more law enforcement.

"I think the other response to this comment has a lot of truth to it, but like any place, you'll find what you look for. There's a common attitude called the Seattle Freeze, where new people in your life, if you meet any in the first place, want to hang out but then ghost and stop replying. I've been here for about a decade, and have had that happen a lot. Then again, I have a few friends I really like.

As for theft, it's a real issue. Property crime is very high, and I've had my car broken into twice, once in two different areas, and my catalytic converter stolen. A homeless person walked into my house one morning when I'd left the door unlocked overnight, but left when they realized I was home. Keep nothing of value in your car, and install a cat guard to keep your catalytic converter from walking off.

The bad aside, there's a lot of nature in the area that's really cool, and you can get a lot of different varieties of it within short drives.

I used to walk downtown with my camera, sometimes with a friend who shot professionally, and we never got bothered. We're two skinny guys about 6'. There's plenty to shoot, and if you have experience shooting street photography, then you'll be adept at not drawing attention.
