"You‚Äôre welcome. Since you‚Äôre moving to LA from NY, I wanna say I‚Äôm happy to hear you‚Äôre considering Santa Clarita. Gonna harp on the prioritizing kids thing, but from what I remember growing-ish up here, working here for 15 years, and having lived in various parts of SCV (Saugus and now Canyon Country) for a total of 6 years, I consider it really, really family friendly/focused. One of my roommates (both a teacher and a baseball/track coach) years ago told me, after I asked him why there are so many extracurriculars here and especially about sports, ‚ÄúWell, when you don‚Äôt have to worry about all the crime and problems of a big city like Los Angeles, the kids have nothing else to do but play sports.‚Äù So, I‚Äôm biased (and hopeful, because my kid‚Äôs 4, and we moved here ‚Äúfor the schools‚Äù), but it seems like she‚Äôs gonna have a great future because of where we‚Äôre raising her. 

However, let‚Äôs not sugar coat it. The ABSOLUTE WORST part of living in SCV is that, if you have to commute into LA, the traffic is unbelievably mind-numbing, depressing, and debilitating. I know because I did it for a couple years. I balk at all the people doing it, who presumably live either in Santa Clarita or further on the north side of Los Angeles. However, I tell myself that, for those people driving that hellish drive, they are doing it for their kids to live in a better area than LA. To afford a better, bigger, affordable household than what LA can ridiculously offer. 

I‚Äôm not going to bash just on Los Angeles city (cause I loved living there when I was young and single), but it‚Äôs fucking ridiculous how housing prices are. I even look at the cost of my single-family home, and I think that, while it obviously benefits me, it‚Äôs fucking ridiculous that housing prices are the way they are. For you and any new people that want to raise kids in Los Angeles, SCV can be a really awesome place. Aside from commute, the higher fire risk, and it being somewhat boring here, it is definitely one of the best suburbs of LA.",t2_5vqh9,appleavocado,0,1648147560.0,0,t1_i1yqyfp,i1yqyfp,False,Infinite-Win7711,t3_tjpnwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaClarita/comments/tjpnwr/whats_the_biggest_differences_between_all_the/,What‚Äôs the biggest differences between all the neighborhoods in SCV?,/r/SantaClarita/comments/tjpnwr/whats_the_biggest_differences_between_all_the/i1yqyfp/,2,r/SantaClarita,0,2

"Please keep in mind our high fire risk. In one of the most recent fires in LA County, the winds were so crazy that, in rare cases, homes that were *not* on the perimeter were set ablaze, because the winds were just that crazy. That's a really rare example, but not impossible.

I'm a parent, too. But after going through this thread, I wanted to hammer that point in. Still, for you I'd prioritize in order:

* schools - that really depends on your kids' needs
* safety - as others have mentioned, there are some bad-ish areas to avoid everywhere, but you should be fine (it's not like Los Angeles proper)
* IF you plan on commuting to LA, proximity to either the 5 or 14 freeway - a typical M-F 9-5 job can be hell for commuters, who can spend 1-3 hours one-way, or wake up crazy early just to avoid traffic. That's a much bigger story, but tens of thousands of people do it from SCV and beyond.
* fire risk - as I've said, in the absolute worst cases it's unavoidable for everyone.

"I was born in NY but moved to Santa clarita in my elementary years.  IMO Westridge, Stevenson Ranch, and Valencia are where you want to look. SCV is nothing like NY and the further into santa clarita you get (further from the 5 freeway) the more different from NY you'll get.  All my neighbors in Stevenson Ranch are transplants from outside the State or outside Los Angeles. 

Santa Clarita is a purple area in terms of politics, some hard left, some hard right, a lot of the middle. Nothing in Santa Clarita is really cheap but in the more affluent areas you will experience a lot more of a progressive mindset.   If that doesn't bother you then you're open to a lot more places to live here but if you're of a progressive mindset and dont' want to see your neighbors still with a trump 2020 bumper sticker i'd say you're going to have to pay for some of the more affluent areas.  not saying those people don't exist in the more expensive homes but it's definitely fewer and farther between.

"Each area really has some key differences. Valencia, Stevenson ranch and Saugus having the predominant amount of the higher wages. But there are areas in canyon country and newhall that have high real estate prices as well. I‚Äôll list some of the metric that separate the areas.

- schools, some areas are better than others. That info is easy to find. 

-commute. Some areas are a shorter drive to the 5/14. Saugus is known for being the furthest away. Also if you or partner are commuting. Having a house closer to LA does help. Castaic vs. Stevenson ranch for instance. 

-crime. These statistics are also easy to find. Also, I don‚Äôt think any one area is the worst. Each area has its own ‚Äúbad neighborhood‚Äù. Some just might  have a couple of them.

-type of house. Some areas are older, some neighborhoods brand new. Some areas even have large property. Just depends on price range. 

- Price. Places like Castaic, Canyon country, Saugus and newhall will be cheaper than Valencia and Stevenson ranch. But like I mentioned before each area has its own million dollar plus neighborhoods anyways.

Key for abbreviations is at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

Find more details on any listing by simply googling the info or you can copy the listing ID # (aka MLS#) and entering it into a site like [this one](https://www.bhhscaprops.com/). FYI, this site is not the listing agent site, it's a broker where you can see the full listing with pictures. To inquire about the rental, call the number in the spreadsheet.

It's always a good idea to use a [MIMO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OUg120ZWzVKcHRTCiQKPs3CvHxAbxfth/view) form (Move In / Move Out) when renting. It's a checklist of a visual inspection made on the unit at the time you move in that you and your landlord sign off on and verifies the condition of varying aspects of the unit. You'll use it again when you move out to verify the condition and hopefully everyone agrees.

"You will likely get a lot of suggestions (or warnings) around The Promenade. It is one of the complexes with the most amenities and pretty much the best location. However, its policies are terrible. They will raise your rent an inordinate amount every year without fail. They will not discourage you from switching units to get back at the introductory rate; but of course changing your address every year is probably not fun. Here are some suggestions to get you started. Good luck.

Typically for the area boats reside on trailers. There are a lot of lots that are open for boat storage(trailer) if you can not find a house with sufficient space. HOA are a plenty so keeping it on a street would be a no go for most of the SCV. The only water front we have is Castaic Lake but it is a Reservoir so no boat storage or property allowed. They are also very stringent having the boat 100% dry before launching any boat as there is threat of invasive species they are trying to eliminate. I don't own a boat but I have been around fishing in the lake to know the rules and have had neighbors with boats that will talk your ear off if asked about it:p.

"Pyramid and Castaic are ‚Äúdawn to dusk‚Äù lakes. Plenty deep for most anything but no traditional docks (have to be off the lake at dusk). Piru does have docks but it‚Äôs the smallest lake that takes boats.

"I'd call the pizzas available to be mediocre at best. The old local chains have their fans, but many of them aren't as good as they used to be. Ameci's (I order from the one on Lyons) dough isn't great which lowers the quality of the whole pie. Vincenzos has the love it or hate it bread loaf crust. I feel like they use overly salty sauces and cheese which mask any quality of ingredients they are using. Toppers is the new big thing in the SCV and it feels like they just used the base pizza recipe from Round Table (and dropped the incredibly silly tiny slices) and focused on the toppings. Of the new pizza places that are popping up everywhere, it's probably your best bet.

The shame in Santa Clarita is that there is no good wood fired place that serves a classic margherita or a competent pizzeria with a great New York style slice. The places that are opening are ones that focus on toppings and have gluten free offerings like Topper's, Tomato Joe's, MOD pizza, zPizza (which was legitimately terrible and now thankfully gone), and Pizza Rev (which I guess didn't survive the pandemic). Those, again, aren't bad, they just aren't working on the classics. When I'm craving a great NY pie, I hit Mulberry Street in Sherman Oaks/Encino. My favorite margherita was a long closed place in Hollywood called Pan e Vino (used to be on Beverly and Sweetzer).

If you are into pizza in the SCV, your best bet may be becoming your own pizzaiolo with an Ooni or Gozney oven in your backyard. If you do go this route, make sure you use 00 flour in your dough.",t2_6e3xi,loserwill,0,1647186267.0,0,t1_i0i37dz,i0i37dz,True,LetterAccomplished,t3_td5j98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaClarita/comments/td5j98/who_has_the_best_pizza_in_santa_clarita_what/,Who has the best pizza in Santa Clarita.

The issue is really just finding someone I can trust that will tell us honestly what we should do for maximum return. 

If the answer is investing in the house we would do that. If the answer is selling as is as a fixer upper then we‚Äôd do that.

I appreciate the reply, I have a lot of people to call thanks to you all.

"Fair point. I'll amend that I don't actually hold the assumption that there is definitively no god. And I wouldn't until such time as his existence has been empirically disproven. However, disproving god's existence is not something science is interested in pursuing. Science is only interested in the pursuit of what ""is"" true, not in definitively falsifying what isn't.

That said, as of this moment, there is not so much as a single shred of empirical evidence in support of god that is not more easily explained via natural physical processes so I'm admittedly inclined toward my suspicions.

"Depends on your work hours. I work in Van Nuys and used to live in Torrance before moving out to SCV. The 405 south backs up from Sunset Blvd all the way over the Sepulveda pass by around 7am.

"Haha for sure, well beyond the 2015 completion date for the project.

Hopefully this holds true for the phases, although the metrolink center looks very nearly done and there are signs saying ""Opening early 2022"". So I think they moved that up.

They are way behind on that bridge, though. Says it will be done by the ""150th occupancy with PA-3"" and though I haven't counted how many houses there are, pretty sure we're past 150 and there's no signs of anything going up there yet.

But I assume it'll all come in due time. Construction timelines are always pretty hard to lay out and I'm sure the supply chain disruptions and general economic upheaval of the past two years have cause a lot of reconsideration on this project.

I'm wondering when Vista Canyon proper is going to break more ground. So far there is only one commercial building and a parking garage.

But we were told there was going to be a lot of shopping, dining, a movie theater, a grocery store, all within walking distance, and so far I see no evidence of them moving forward with any of those projects.

"I went to SCCS: Santa Clarita Christian School

There was one reason why I loved going there and she's gone now. She moved back to her home state, and as far as I'm concerned that school had little else going for it.

Some of the teachers there are great, but overall it just wants to send your kid to the college the principal went to, cuz yknow he ""loved it so much.""

It's main goal is to be a church fronting as a school. When I went there each class was required to involve some form of biblical teaching, including subjects like geometry. I remember that teacher (the math teacher) being so perplexed by this rule that he just said at the beginning of his class: ""I'm required to have some sort of Bible lesson in my class from now on, so I'm going to show you an example of how triangles are like the holy trinity! It has 3 sides, just like the father, the son, and the holy spirit. Ummmm..... so onto the lesson today...""

It was ridiculous. That was 10 years ago so I hope they're not as tone deaf and obviously brainwashing, but I don't have a lot of faith that much has changed.

"I was replying to another poster, but it got deleted. I think it's important though to see where I am coming from, so I will still post it:

&#x200B;

I teach in the valley. Kids at my school have been extremely respectful over wearing masks, getting weekly tested, etc. And are pretty vocal about being environmentally conscious. And overall, are extremely supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. I don't know the political views of all the teachers, but of those few I do know most are progressive when it comes to topics such as these.

My conservative remark is based on a few things I've seen out here:

1. Parents absolutely livid over their kids wearing masks
2. (Or more like 1.b.) There was that article over the Saugus student ""standing up for freedom"" over masks.
3. One of my kids' teacher encouraged the kids to take off masks because ""they don't work.""
4. My other kid and I had to have a big conversation when their teacher told them electric cars were a waste (we have one) and that it's propaganda to think they are better than oil cars.
5. Parents fighting against the new Health Education Standards.
6. Having to talk with my kids over being an LGBTQ+ ally as their classmates make fun of those in the community.

If there is one thing I know as a teacher, it's that 70% of what kids believe, they got from their parents. And it's one thing to have a few kids/teachers who are of that mindset, but I don't want my kids to have to deal with a majority with that mindset, and being singled out.

"I am originally from the Milwaukee suburbs, have lived in SCV for two years now. It feels exactly like living in Waukesha/Brookfield. If that is any reference.

"1. The worst parts of Newhall or Canyon Country are still much safer, and cleaner then LA. 

2. Valencia is green, the others not so much. Valencia has the paseo system and many parks. Further out you get from Valencia more dry it will feel in general but all cities have their pockets of green. Having said that, it's not the tropical type of greenery that you may remember from West LA area. 

3. No one is going to stare at you or judge you. Specially at the gym.

4. People in general are very nice. It's getting more crowded and with that the freeway and the streets are getting more trafficy and I have noticed overall increase in road rage, more honking, and yelling from car to car but walking about the streets people are going to say hi, even be too friendly and so on.  It's more of a conservative town so as long as you are not blasting loud music, you are picking up your dog's poop and keeping your front yard clean, you will be fine. 

5. There is no public transportation. In reality there is but I don't know if you can use it to get to work. 

6. Most random thing?
Blue trash bin is for trash
Grey trash bin is for grass/green waste
Green trash bin is for recycling.

"Oh a bunch. Ill ramble off a few. A guard had to go up into the skytower at night by himself to do firewatch for 4th of July. After he came down he said he could hear footsteps walking around the area, and when they approached him a freezing cold wave passed through him.   
When Mooseburger lodge was being renovated into the sportsbar, the fire alarm system was taken offline, so Security had to be inside 24/7 for firewatch. A bunch of different guards at night all said it was haunted as shit. Hearing voices, footsteps, a rocking chair creaking.   
One guy was driving through the park at night and saw a small area of fog, when he drove through it he saw like shapes of people inside, he noped the fuck out and just left the area.   
A guard was walking through Huricane Harbor late at night as a shortcut. He saw a trashcan with the side open. He went over to close it but it popped back open. After closing it a third time the whole can flew a few feet onto its side. He ran away.   
Guards at night would hear voices calling their name from under buildings or set pieces.   
My personal one, I was working late at night inside the Dispatch (The security office with the cameras and the main phone line of the property.) I got a call and the caller ID said it was the elevator of Riddler's Revenge. I answered and all I heard was like wind noises and this rhythmic tapping. Everytime I hung up, it would call back. I had to send another guard over to it, who said he found the phone just hanging off its receiver.

This is good info on the racial make up of the local high schools I believe on average. I can say that each school will differ in racial make up. I believe this is just an average 
 
Quotes:
‚ÄúStudents at William S. Hart Union High
The student body at the schools served by William S. Hart Union High is 36.7% White, 3.8% Black, 12.9% Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander, 41.5% Hispanic/Latino, 0.1% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. In addition, 4.9% of students are two or more races, and 0% have not specified their race or ethnicity.
Also, 49% of students are female, and 51% of students are male. At schools in William S. Hart Union High, 10.1% of students are eligible to participate in the federal free and reduced price meal program and 4.5% of students are English language learners.‚Äù

‚ÄúWilliam S. Hart Union High contains 17 schools and 22,228 students. The district‚Äôs minority enrollment is 60%. Also, 10.1% of students are economically disadvantaged‚Äù

As a mixed race household myself, I‚Äôve looked at schools. And I‚Äôve attended certain schools in the area after attending LAUSD as a kid. I remember Santa Clarita schools being further ahead and of better quality than the ones I went to in the valley. 

Not sure why people on here are saying the schools are predominantly white. None of the info I‚Äôve been able to review says that. I‚Äôm seeing an average around 40% Caucasian. Again, I believe schools in more affluent areas of SCV will have a different racial make up. Probably just like the rest of the county and state.

"> That‚Äôs why I mentioned ‚Äúunless someone is unvaxxed‚Äù. 

From the article:

> Among the schools was Legacy Christian Academy, which had been cited a dozen times for violations of COVID-19 health orders as of January, according to public health department records. In September, a public health inspector repeatedly found that school staffers at Legacy Christian Academy were not wearing face coverings as required, citations show.

> When the same inspector came back again and again in October and November to check if the school was following the rules, school staff refused to give him access to the facility, leading to more fines, the county citations indicate. A Legacy Christian Academy administrator did not respond to messages seeking comment.

So this issue was occurring when kids under 12 did not have access to vaccine... so unvaxxed... I would also speculate, even with vaccines available down to 5 years old, trinity and other christian schools probably have a low adoption rate... so they likely still have a population of students and faculty unvaxxed.

"May I ask, where are you & your SO looking to work? If it's located south of SCV/towards Los Angeles *and* during a typical 9-5 M-F workweek, I HIGHLY suggest not living here and braving the commute. It's absolutely one of the worst commutes in LA county, with very little alternatives.

However, thousands of people living in SCV and beyond do this daily, amounting to a 1-2 hour minimum drive each way, depending on the destination. It can be hell, and take an unknown mental and physical toll.

However, if you can work in SCV, or work in LA at odd hours, the commute is fine.

I can't exactly speak for schools, since my kid's too young yet. However, I grew up in an area not too far from here. In just the last 30-50 years, SCV's gotten a bit less primarily white. There is a white flight factor, but also a middle- to upper-class flight factor as well, which means SCV's gotten more diverse. Housing can be crazy but not stupidly crazy like certain parts of LA. I asked my roommates (who grew up here and are currently teachers/youth coaches) why there's so much sports & extra curricular activities here, and one responded: ""Well, when you don't have to worry about crime and other parts of living in LA you don't have much else to do than play sports."" Hart High School is known for pumping out professional athletes. There's a Cincinnati Bengal in next week's Super Bowl who came from there, and in the 2016 World Series there was a pitcher each on both teams from Hart.

I think you and your family will be happy here. If you can find work and not have an absolute hell of a commute (that's another story), SCV can be a very peaceful place to grow up.",t2_5vqh9,appleavocado,0,1644258313.0,0,t1_hvz435r,hvz435r,False,Infinite-Win7711,t3_slfje0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaClarita/comments/slfje0/how_are_the_schools_in_valencia/,How are the schools in Valencia?,/r/SantaClarita/comments/slfje0/how_are_the_schools_in_valencia/hvz435r/,4,r/SantaClarita,0,4

"Yes. One year, a group of 5th grade girls showed up on the first day in a limo and there was SO MUCH DRAMA about who was invited/who wasn‚Äôt.

"High school wise: there is the academy of the canyons which is part of the local community college. I think they take college courses as high school students. Very limited class size though. Highly ranked in california.

The rest of the schools are above average compared to the rest of the state, but not spectacular. 

The thing about the greater LA area is that LA proper (LAUSD) has a poor public school system. The best schools are private and intensely competitive, eg harvard westlake. There are a handful of great public high schools, like la canada high school, but it is tucked far away in the corner and not accessible for most people.

As far as diversity goes: you will find that the best schools in California all have higher proportions of asians.

"The election was stolen. The easiest way to tell are the results to the Bell Weather Counties.
Mike Garcia and any other politician seeking to eradicate or verify the election results are patriots !!!
Secondly, there is no way Biden got more votes than Obama.
Shout out to the idiots that voted Biden in strictly because the media took you all for fools.
If you can't see that the Democrats have the media in their pockets your part of the problem this country has...
75 million people are tired of the same games being played by these career politicians on both sides of the isle.
They all abuse their powers and make themselves wealthy doing it !!!
The Democratic Party wants and is destroying America !!!
The proof is right in your faces but alot of you Democratic/Liberal sheep keep drinking the various Kool Aids.

There is no other explanation for the gas in 10 months to double in price other than the fact that we have traitors in our government. So called American politicians working for the improvement of other foreign governments at the tax payers cost.
Hunter Biden and his pedophile daddy need to be investigated with the same scrutiny as Trump and his kids.
The President of the free world was censored during and election and you people were okay with it.
