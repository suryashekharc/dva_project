"You will pay about the same on mortgage as you will rent.  It's a no brainer to buy, imo.  You will build equity and will most likely capitalize on a house that is increasing in value.

Even if the market crashed tomorrow (not going to happen) the likelihood of it not recovering in 10 years is infinitesimally small.

Also keep in mind that your mortgage payment will be more or less constant, where rent goes up with inflation.",t2_a66gm,spongebob_meth,0,1648214150.0,0,t1_i227qb0,i227qb0,True,ch3fjulio,t3_tmr4i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleRock/comments/tmr4i2/buy_a_house_now_or_wait/,Buy a house now or wait?,/r/LittleRock/comments/tmr4i2/buy_a_house_now_or_wait/i227qb0/,2,r/LittleRock,0,2

"Sorry to be the pedant, but they would have about $45,000 “put into a house” after 10 years if payment was $1000 per month on a 30 year loan.

"It's not absolutely insane like the city I left, but it's higher than usual for this town. The average time from listing-to-closing was significantly lower last year than usual which is part of how you can tell demand/supply is borked from the usual baseline. This year is not as extreme, but still not back to the normal balance from what I can tell.

Here's another thing: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS) \-- a graph of average home prices over time in USA. The part at the end is steep and annoying. But historically big declines/price corrections are rare and correlate to shitty economic times. Pick any year on that line and count forward 10 years — the trends are historically good for holding a house that long even through the roughest economic times (assuming you can keep enough income during the roughest years to keep up with house payments -- but making a monthly payment is a problem for renters, too).

"Since you're going to be here for 10 years, I'd buy (or I'd be seriously looking at houses with the intent to buy while renting to hedge my bets). Prices may go down at some point, but I don't see it happening in the short term with inflation pressures spread across so many building inputs.

Last summer people were shouting ""we're in a bubble that's about to burst, don't buy now!"".  I think the market has stabilized some, but it has not burst and probably won't — prices were being driven up by lack of inventory and high demand, and that's a totally different scenario than the 2008 housing crisis. Inflation pressures are making everything you'd need to build a home more expensive, thus making it harder to create more houses to meet demand. I just don't see housing prices dropping in a big way in the short term.

Obvi I'm a random person on the internet, so take it with a grain of salt!

Timing the market is hard/impossible. If you're financially stable and can afford a house go for it.

"I’ll admit I was a bit confused by that. Because for years, it’s been reported that it was in fact a rape. My thinking for this sudden shift in the narrative is:

-Maybe what they meant to say on the podcast was that the encounter started off consensually, but the filming wasn’t consensual and therefore turned into an assault. Because there certainly is an issue of consent there, as it sounds like she never consented to filmed sex. 

But I’m unsure.

If you don’t use a large cleaver on folded noodles but keep it spread out about 1-2mm thick and cut it quickly in lines you can avoid the thickness the ones you see have.  Those were done with the dough folded over each other and sectioned with a cleaver which was the best a available.

"The sauce for dumplings has 4-5 ingredients that are pretty consistent across all recipes and they are going to be minced garlic (1 clove), scallions (up to you but use the green not the white), soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar also known as chinkiang vinegar, you can find it at Asian grocery such as mr Chens. And a chili paste, available at Kroger but a better selection than Kroger.  Soy sauce will be your dominate liquid in the dumpling sauce.  I advise just doing it in small amounts for everything and tasting it and adding to find the taste you like.  Minced or smashed ginger in this will also give it an extra high sensory flavor. Now for noodles you want 313 grams of strong bread flour, then two eggs and enough water to make the combined weight 156 grams, you will need a kitchen scale to make noodles. And half teaspoon salt.  You will want to put the Flour on a rolling mat and almost make a volcano like shape with high rims and a empty middle, put the eggs and water and salt in the middle and bring to knead it together.  You want these to come out spongy and you might need to add more water but knead it for 10 min and see how it is, if it’s flaking too much wet your hands and continue it should look like this after 20 min,  here is a pic of the ball almost ready and I don’t have a pasta press so my noodles are too think but if you use a pizza cutter it’s easier than a knife I think, which is what I used in this pic.

"I lived at RSL for quite a while. My unit needed updating but I think they were doing that when I left. The south facing units suck because the hotel is right there so no light/view.

The worst part about it was the insanely thin walls. I could hear my neighbors’ phone when it was on vibrate. It transferred smells too. I knew what the people next door were cooking. 

The good part is the location. You’re right in the heart of everything. Close to bars and restaurants, close to the river, close to the farmers market, and any events happening down town. It used to be the best during riverfest.

"The first episode of season 4 is scheduled to be released tomorrow, and I wanted to do a write up of the case because it’s personal to me, and to Little Rock! 

Ebby Steppach was a teenager from Little Rock, Arkansas. She vanished into thin air in October of 2015, and for three years, no one knew what had happened. That is, until May of 2018. Ebby’s remains were found underground in a storm drain, less than 100 ft from where her abandoned vehicle had been found a week after she was reported missing. The car had been found with Ebby’s belongings scattered everywhere, the keys still if the ignition, and the battery completely dead. 

The events leading up to Ebby’s disappearance are very suspicious. 
Just days before she was reported missing, Ebby had attended a party, presumably held by students at her new school, Central High. She had switched to public school for her senior year of high school. Ebby’s friends that have been interviewed have stated that Ebby was spending time with people they didn’t know. At this party, Ebby was raped, and it was filmed. What she remembers of the attack is described in text messages between she and one of her friends. She decided to tell her stepfather about the assault a couple of days later, and also said she wanted to go to the police. She asked him not to tell her mother yet, and that she wanted to report the assault first. However, before they could make the plans to meet up and go to the police station together, she stopped answering. Her family tried frantically to try and locate her for the next several hours, to no avail. The last person to hear from her was her older brother, who stated that she sounded strange, maybe under the influence of something. Ebby had answered one of his phone calls and said that she was in her car, and outside of his house. But when he went outside, neither Ebby or her car were there. 

I knew Ebby when we were kids, as we both grew up in the area. About a year ago, I sat down and made my first podcast, entirely dedicated to her case. It’s called Subterfuge in Chalamont Park. I’m so excited though to see a big name like Hell and Gone covering her case. I know Catherine Townsend is going to do a good job!

Ebby and her loved ones deserve justice, and her family especially deserves answers after all of the LRPD’s attempts to deny them closure.",t2_5jrwe68j,Celestial_Capricorn,0,1647998385.0,0,t1_i1qmwgg,i1qmwgg,True,Celestial_Capricorn,t3_tkif6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleRock/comments/tkif6s/ebby_steppachs_case_to_be_covered_in_season_4_of/,Ebby Steppach’s case to be covered in season 4 of Hell and Gone podcast,/r/LittleRock/comments/tkif6s/ebby_steppachs_case_to_be_covered_in_season_4_of/i1qmwgg/,41,r/LittleRock,0,41

"Shattered writing this. I need to rehome the love of my life. My shadow. I am moving out of the state in 2 months and he can't come with me. I think this might be the death of me.

Located in North Little Rock. Must meet you to make sure it's a good fit.

The goodest boi, Rowdy (Rowdy Roddy Piper), is a 3 year old Mountain Cur Dutch shepherd mix. He was originally rescued from a shelter as a puppy. He's very nervous about new people at first, but loves you intensely when he knows you. He is full of love and wants to be with you nonstop, and has separation anxiety when you're gone. He is good on a leash and in the car. He is afraid of other dogs, and chases cats so it's best if he's an only pet. He needs to be someone's best friend and go everywhere you go, he wants to be snuggled against your back at night when you sleep. He loves to run and hike. He needs room to play and all the toys cause he's the best boi. He has the softest ears on the face of the earth. I'm bawling right now, this is so hard 😭  He has all of his shots. He is straight up gorgeous, and has a legit heart on his back.

He CANNOT go to anyone who will dump him, yell at him, or hurt him. He needs someone who is patient and kind, with a calm demeanor, and can give him endless love and reassurances because he's going to be very afraid and not knowing where his Mommy is. Omg this is brutal.

Yes, I have contacted rescues. Everyone is full. No, I won't ever take him back to a shelter.

If anyone is looking for their absolute best friend and the sweetest dog ever, message me.",t2_7czb095u,Sekihoshi8,0,1647978237.0,0,t1_i1paji5,i1paji5,True,Sekihoshi8,t3_tkb8q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleRock/comments/tkb8q0/i_need_to_rehome_my_heart_my_shadow_i_am_moving/,I need to rehome my heart.

"I posted their statement from Facebook in a comment above. The grapevine gossip I heard was: “A current manager AND a former manager posted about how they do the tips to explain. Even showed a pay stubs. It's 3 employees that got fired and are pissed. They portray like they get paid service wages and tips are how they live. The employees get paid over the state minimum wage , usually 13/hour starting. All employees can work 40 hours if they want, no one is forced to be part time. And they made sure when the pandemic happened that employees could work and make their normal pay without disruption. Business slowed because covid and Lisa made sure the employees got paid.

Three Fold absolutely denies the statements made by these two individuals.

"Parking lots are always considered a disproportionately poor use of possible green space, especially when they sit un-used for big portions of time.  It's an unappealing trade-off that environmentalists tend to take a hardline on.  There's no good answer that will make everyone happy.  Cars are a fact of life, as is the hard infrastructure it takes to support them.  On the flip side, the need for more green space is undeniable.

I like the idea of city-managed, free parking during non-event times, and paid parking (where the city is required to manage and staff the lots, no private contracts allowed) during event times.

I think I prefer the idea of a big green space bordered by small shops, i.e. local and ethnic food, coffee, arts, and the like.  Maybe the addition of some limited, on-street, free parking along the borders would be a decent compromise.",t2_5t85r,BecalMerill,0,1647879656.0,0,t1_i1jokdr,i1jokdr,True,ColorfulImaginati0n,t3_tio49i,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleRock/comments/tio49i/ideas_sought_for_new_green_space_in_downtown/,Ideas Sought for New Green Space in Downtown Little Rock,/r/LittleRock/comments/tio49i/ideas_sought_for_new_green_space_in_downtown/i1jokdr/,0,r/LittleRock,0,0

Best butcher in my opinion is always going to be Hoggs. They slice the meat and put it in the case. I've seen the meat so fresh there's still bone dust on it. Idk if you're going to find fresh good quality wagyu in Arkansas. The ones I see at Sam's and Costco aren't even from the U.S. so I'm forced to say Hoggs Meat Market in North Little Rock. Massive selection of beef cuts and as a butcher they will prepare it as you want it. You want a tomahawk but don't want it attached to the bone?

"That’s a big change from Singapore! I’ve been once and would love to go back. I’d recommend renting a car for sure. There’s hardly any public transportation here. I also wouldn’t walk around the area of UALR past the campus. Especially after dark. Used to work at the Telcoe building and we had very strict security there because of the area. 

There are good areas of the city and bad, and you’ll learn pretty quick from the people around you where to be. General rule especially for women is to be cautious at night and try to walk in groups.

That being said there’s a lot of fun stuff to do if you like the outdoors! We have beautiful lakes and rivers. Like Greers ferry, and the little red river. If the water is warm and high enough the buffalo river is a must go. It’s about 2 or 3 hours out and you can hop on a canoe float with a group.

"Just saying as a single female who was renting in Maumelle it’s gone down. Had to hightail it out of my apartment because they just let it down after Covid. It was getting to be genuinely unsafe. But that’s renting and renting from Lindsey management. Which is a no go. If Lindsey management is involved stay away.  I even have some friends who bought a house and we’re living there for years decide to sell and move out because they were seeing some bad signs.

If you are willing to commute in the mornings I’d recommend Conway. It’s about a 20-30 minute drive though always plan to leave an hour early. But it’s honestly a great place to live. I would if I could.

West Little Rock is great though! The higher end apartments seem safe enough! Two roads to look out for renting on is green mountain and reservoir. Can’t say much else about the area.

"Next time you're in North Little Rock, ask someone about the old nickname, ""Dogtown."" A few years back the name drew equal measures scorn and defensive anger, leading to a tombstone near a floodwall proclaiming ""Here Lies Dogtown."" I believe the tombstone has since been moved into a public building.

Nowadays they have taken on the Argenta name and applied it to the gentrifying area around downtown.

"The article there doesn't say it was meant to divide the city into white and black.  Rather, they had wanted this highway for decades and and was always going to go across town East to West.  The difference between its current location and the alternate (along the river) is that too much (yes, white) culture of note was already along the river bank.

There is systemic racism here, in that they chose the past of least resistance which went through mostly Black residential neighborhoods.  But it wasn't like, hey let's draw a race line.  

Most cities are built on rivers and they develop outwards from a core of downtown/urban which was of course institutionally white at the time.  The location of black neighborhoods was originally because those were the cheap, out-in-nowhere places white people weren't going anyway.  Usually the first black neighborhoods in young American cities were on the East side, because that's where the pollution from downtown industry made property nearly worthless.  There's much to be said about LR's racist history with the destruction of black neighborhoods on our East and Southeast side - in those cases, it was very much about getting rid of black folks (and all the homeless they dumped out there during the Depression).
