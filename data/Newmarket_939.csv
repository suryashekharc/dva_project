my best advice is drop off papercopy resumes in person.. those people get swamped with resumes in thier inbox.. a paper one will sit on their desk and get noticed. i recently tweaked my resume... made it vaguer with less important details and more general terms.. handed out  7 in person.. got 4 interviews.. landed two job offers. turned down one that paid less than i wanted. happy with new wage im receiving.. was well worth a couple of trips to staples to print them out.,t2_j8cpojvw,reallyslowvan,0,1647911844.0,0,t1_i1lucus,i1lucus,True,cantspellawesome,t3_tjgdvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newmarket/comments/tjgdvx/career_counselling_services_recommendations_wanted/,Career Counselling Services - Recommendations Wanted,/r/Newmarket/comments/tjgdvx/career_counselling_services_recommendations_wanted/i1lucus/,3,r/Newmarket,0,3

They told me they couldn’t fix it because they were too busy and said I needed to book an appointment. Soonest appointment I could get was a week away. I literally had the car for only 15 minutes.

I escalated within the dealership and kept getting told I’d have to wait until my scheduled appointment. So every survey I got asking me about my experience resulted in a 1 out of 10 score. 

Oh, they also misdiagnosed the problem the first time. They thought the mechanism in the mirror was broken so I had to wait for them to order the part.

"> these lockdowns are needed to ensure our health facilities don’t collapse.

To slow the spread of the virus between people. The effects of especially the current dominant Omicron virus and the previous ones are no more lethal than annual flu and are mostly managed at home. And the numbers in ICU and hospital reflect previous years' counts during flu seasons.

400 billion dollars can significantly expand ICU and hospital capacity PERMANENTLY across the country by many times what it is and permanently address the decade of health facilities being overflow...but nobody cared about that before COVID until they had to wait 5-6 hours in the ER.

4 billion dollars was a hard pass between each provincial administration before. 40 billion would have been enough for new hospitals in every province including funds to maintain all for decades. 400 billion would be unimaginable. With 300k regular immigration per year and nearly 1 million migrant workers per year coming from both old and new programs, all eligible for permanent residency after a period in Canada since 2017, the existing facilities need to be expanded with the growing population.",t2_1lps3va2,NationalRock,0,1645194117.0,0,t1_hxg5kim,hxg5kim,False,gilping,t3_sv6iaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newmarket/comments/sv6iaq/canadians_feeling_oppressed_newmarket_councillor/,Canadians 'feeling oppressed': Newmarket councillor posts pro-Freedom Convoy message on Facebook,/r/Newmarket/comments/sv6iaq/canadians_feeling_oppressed_newmarket_councillor/hxg5kim/,3,r/Newmarket,0,3

"Beware when contacting doctors on this list. 
I moved to EG 3 years ago and was looking for a doctor for our family of 5. I enrolled with one of these doctors and she turned out to be a total nightmare. She refuses to see patients in person, childrens’ vaccines are only supplied when she can cram all her patients on the same day, she has a new admin every month so booking appointments can take weeks. 

I've been relying on walk-in clinics because I'm still looking for a new doctor. 

Dr. Bell is excellent but he's not taking new patients.

"The OLT is a waste of resources. A developer can be denied a permit by the town but an appeal to the OLT is almost always successful, even if it’s a lower density than what the city is mandated to enforce for the property. It creates needless bureaucracy and worst results for the community.

"38M - Moved to Newmarket from Toronto in August.  Here's what I've come to love:

Main street Restaurants: The Goulash House (my #1 pick)  Hop Bop Noodle Shop, Sushi Jun.  (Sushi Jun has sushi better than anything I was getting at Yonge and Eglinton before the move - it's fantastic) When the Ghost Taco pop-up is available, it's pretty good too.  

Pizza: Papillon Pizza (Bayview and Mulock) - Small joint, I think they get overwhelmed with orders often and turn off their online stores - try calling.  If you like thick crusts try Timbo Slice (people rave, but it's NMCOT) 

Thai: Orchid Thai in Aurora - I haven't found great Thai food out here since leaving Toronto, but this is the best of the 4-5 places we've tried so far.  (Also, Aurora is so close, and worth the drive on pickups. There's also no dispensaries in Newmarket, so Aurora is a good bet for that too)

Indian: Vintage Spice in Aurora. Tried once, would have again. 

Chinese: We've ordered from Cynthia's and it was pretty good. 

Massage: Vitality Wellness - Ive been using an RMT there. 

Gym: Groundworx CrossFit - Small gym but FANTASTIC group of people and energy.  You don't have to be into CrossFit programming either - there's open gym hours and lots of space/equipment.  Easy spot to make friends, best choice I made since moving here. 

Bakeries: Nutmeg on Main Street has some damn good bread.  Hurst in Aurora makes a really great Lemon Loaf/Banana Bread and many other baked goods - but we've had two of their Cake cakes, and been disappointed - WAY too much icing. Fantastic Cheese Bread. 

We get our Bagels from Bagel World (good breakfast spot too) but if anyone knows a better bagel joint please hit me up.  (I like them denser and chewier)

Kloster's is a good butcher shop. 

Metropolis is good for fancy coffee, they have some good bakery treats on offer as well. Cool little boutique shops in there as well. I have yet to find a best source for beans to grind at home - so I've been sticking to supermarket. 

Local Breweries: Market Brewing is great! Lots of events, good bottle shop offerings, and lots of selection.  The George on Main Street is decent, smaller batch. Old Flame isn't a truly 'Newmarket' brewery - but their beer is good, and they bring in great music, and we loved their patio in the summer. Hungry Brew Hops has a great taps selection, but I've found their food hit or miss for me. Which is a shame because they also own Little Hops and Hop Bop that  are more reliable. 

Bars: For Cocktails Little Hops Tavern is the only place I've found doing great cocktails.  A lot of locals rolled their eyes when talking about ""The OV"" Old Village Free House on Main as well, but they do a lot of live music and a couple of the nights we've been in there have been the most fun we've had in Newmarket. 

I'm a TTRPG guy, so if you're into that kind of hobby, I have been into Goblets and Goblins, Hobby Knight in Canada, and Enter the Battlefield and found everyone to be very friendly and receptive.  Seems like there's lots of space and they really want events back.  Pandemic has been a bitch. 

If you're still looking for your booster - the provincial portal had lots of options at Ray Twinney Sports Complex, and the clinic was quick and efficient.  I waited in 1-2 hour lines at arenas in Toronto for my first two shots. 

That's a pretty good summary of 5 months here.

"Chinese food. Cynthia’s Restaurant 

I do doordash and Uber eats for Christmas and New Years if you order through apps we end up waiting 30+ minutes with 10-20 other people cause it’s one of few that opens on these days. So order via their website and yeah they got their own delivery drivers who will deliver your food whenever it’s ready. They open usually by noon on these holidays

Lee Chen and other places don’t have their own drivers their websites sub contract to doordash or ubereats and think also skip the dishes? You wanna skip the markups just order from Cynthia’s restaurant website.

We order once a month or so from them cause they got awesome chicken signature dishes. We make our own rice so saves plenty of money. Their stuff don’t come with rice unless you order enough then you get a fried rice for free if it’s a pickup but it’s not worth it especially having to wait 40-50 minutes pickup on those big no pickup days of the year. Just order delivery and save yourself 2 hours of your life!

Garlic Chicken (salty not sweet)

Green Curry Chicken (very light to no curry taste at all but super delicious)

Z Chicken (sweet not salty)

Their samosas are tasty and very nice but small portion so often not worth it.

Beef flat noodle taste much better than other Chinese places we tried.

They got some crazy expensive stuff too like live lobsters and French wines if you into more high end stuff, but if anything I recommend the 3 chickens. Can’t go wrong with it and you get to try 3 distinct nice flavours.

"Glad everyone is OK, hopefully you can live in your house?  If not prepare yourself for the gutting experience you are about to have with your insurance company.

Don't let them book the hotel rooms for you, they will charge you a % on top of room cost that will eat into your allowance.  If you end up renting a place, they may end up using a service to 'pay' to landlord and that service may also cost you a hefty % out of your allowance for housing...sometimes up to 30% (rather than a flat fee)

Hire your own appraiser to come in and estimate the damage.....it is not always visible. 

Smoke damage can destroy items in other rooms...your cutlery in a drawer, even after running through the dishwasher 3 times has an awful taste....

They may charge hire out someone to 'inventory' your items and their charges are horrendous and come out of the amount allotted to your household items....  apartment fire in 1 bedroom appt with $30k content insurance, charged almost $9k to catalog items to come to the conclusion that the items are worth over the $30k, so you get $21k and the company they hired gets 9k...",t2_cffab,bruce66wayne,0,1640151429.0,0,t1_hpivis2,hpivis2,True,Whiteherrin,t3_rltxlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newmarket/comments/rltxlf/if_you_heard_about_the_house_fire_on_grace_it_was/,"If you heard about the house fire on grace, it was my house.

"Thanks for the response

Obviously intensification should be highly encouraged in Newmarket due to Newmarket having no more land available for housing developments. Traffic is already getting bad on Davis and Yonge regardless of the Redwood development, a big part of finding a solution to that is getting better transit to get more cars off the roads and I’m sure with more people in condos near transit, not only will it increase growth but also encourage them to just use their transit options which would also encourage the creation of better transit options.

The park was built on an old landfill. Who knows what actually went into that landfill 50 years ago. Hell, just walk around on garbage day in town and look what people are putting in the garbage.

"Back when I used to go to Bradford smoking ciggarrates was popular. Now keep in mind this was before vapes, e cigs, were very popular but they existed just your not cool if you do them so not many did. In my 4 years of high school I never saw 1 person with a vape in my life lol. I'm not sure if they were even a thing back when I went like 10 years ago or just blind.

Yes, drugs were a thing at Bradford but people only did drugs in the bathrooms.

Weed was not legal either back then. 

Plain packaging was not a thing back then. 

Now the school is right across from the gas station. Meaning parents can buy there kid a pack of cigs or darts the term we used 10 years ago for $9. Now a days they could go up to $20 with tax for American spirits. Crazy. My mom always dropped me off at the ramp. The ramp goes to the 2nd main door to the school where all smokers go in the morning.

Now I'm not sure on smoking rules at the school anymore but before on my first day of grade 9 when I went with my dad a kid who looked like he was grade 11  had his ciggarrate in his mouth not sure if lit since I just saw him walk by through the main offices window.  he was escorted outside where he continued to smoke as we saw him when I left the building a few minutes later. Keep in mind this was at 9am so it would be in the middle of first period but no one cared back then your a kid live life. Now days I'm sure there would be a penalty but back then there wasn't and you could smoke basically anywhere as long as it wasn't inside.

Just thinking back reminds me no matter how many times I was late to class I never got any penalty after my first time skipping.

But hey. I did computer science in university so no I'm not a loser just decided to live high school how I wanted. Made it fun for myself.

And despite how I may act about not caring about school and going to class just be nice to everyone. Including teachers. I always was.

"Just because something has become normalized does not make it right. 

Things that you accept as ""ordinary"" actions of the Town were once highly contested.

Example, the drive way by-law: Where more than 50% of your front property must not be a paves driveway area.

People got around this by using interlocking bricks and calling it a walkway, that is sometimes used to park a car.

Accepting every Town bylaw isn't always in the best interests of the person of the Town.

"We are absolutely 'NOT,' under attack. 

This is an alarmist headline... completely click bait and horrible. 

If you own your property, and choose to remove the tree, that you own, on your own land... you should be free to do so.

The town has enough by law restrictions that govern our lives and limit what we can do as far as Zoning.

If the Town is so concerned with trees, they should allocate more park space and tree planting programs. 

The Town needs to stop charging homeowners and private residents for every silly new by law.

Trees regularly produce root damage to building foundations, trees always have branches causing roof damage.

A home owner should not have to pay to submit a proof of necessary tree removal to the town to prove that a tree is damaging their homes.

Further, even if the tree causes no harm, if a new home owner moving into Newmarket pays 1.1 million for their home, and wants to remove one single tree because it blocks their view, then that is their right.

"Haven’t gone to that school, but I some general hard cold tips. 

What I have learned from high school: 

- grades only matter in grade 12

- don’t do stupid sht like smoking or whatever bad for health

- for the first week of school try to hang out with multiple groups of people so you have more people you know. This works for first week as after it won’t be as smooth 

- clubs > studying …you won’t remember the studying you did in high school in the future, but you will remember the clubs you went to, now that doesn’t mean don’t study, just make sure you don’t fail, getting 60s is perfectly fine (grade 9-11)

- grade 12.. now this is where you put your thinking cap on and grind grind for school, get those high marks if you care about going to post secondary 

- finally, just stay positive and make the best of it, no matter what timeline you choose it always turns out to be a good one if you use your judgment and gut feeling",t2_11ke1n,AB_Productions,0,1635816917.0,0,t1_hiyjz9v,hiyjz9v,True,VexedplaysHalo,t3_qkchfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newmarket/comments/qkchfv/bradford_district_high/,Bradford district high,/r/Newmarket/comments/qkchfv/bradford_district_high/hiyjz9v/,6,r/Newmarket,0,6

"I had initially taken my dog to this clinic. At first, I was impressed, however over time, having had to take my dog numerous times to that clinic for a medical issue she has, my opinion has sharply deteriorated. It is impossible to get a hold of them, a.) their reported hours do not reflect their actual hours of operation, b.) when you try calling them, you get put on hold for a significant amount of time (20-30 minutes generally) while they are ""checking in patients"". When you do end up bringing your pet at their scheduled time for their appointment, they are often running extremely late (>1 hour in the past few times I have been there). There is no waiting space inside, and I believe their clinic only has 2 or 3 rooms, so you are typically waiting the entire time outside their office or in your car. 

Currently their office only has one vet, so I believe their clinic is WELL over-booked and over-stretched to handle the case load, leading to these significant delays. There appears on all the occasions I have been in the clinic to be only one front-desk staff, who is fielding calls in addition to checking in patients; from what I have observed, she seems to be flustered as well by the work she has. 

While I understand that a lot of these gripes are related largely to lack of manpower, it has gotten to be too much for me to just disregard. It really has been truly frustrating dealing with their office, and I will be looking to other vets in the area. 

FWIW, I think that the vet is competent, however he has stated he is looking to retire and as the only vet in the office, I feel is probably being thrust with too much. As long as timeliness for you, he may be worth the wait.

My apologies for venting/wall texting here. It has truly been frustrating dealing with my dog at their office, and wanted to give Redditors here my opinion on their clinic. I don't usually write Google Reviews about businesses, however I had seriously considered it if not for the ultra-defensive and reactionary comments back posted for negative reviews by the clinic owner (not sure who that is).",t2_1vf7u81y,amlai42,0,1632244999.0,0,t1_hdqp1rv,hdqp1rv,False,Yvonnemiss,t3_p0lxtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newmarket/comments/p0lxtg/any_recommendation_on_vet_clinic_in_newmarket/,Any Recommendation on Vet clinic in newmarket area and Bradford area?,/r/Newmarket/comments/p0lxtg/any_recommendation_on_vet_clinic_in_newmarket/hdqp1rv/,1,r/Newmarket,0,1
