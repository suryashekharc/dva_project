"One note about the Iron Pointe. I'm guessing it will be at least 6 months before the first home is ready. It's a brand new neighborhood and I don't think any homes have been started yet.   
Homes in that part of Fishers have been selling very quickly and I expect the lots to be snatched up fast once they are available. So if that's where you want to be, the plan would probably be to get on a waiting list and expect to rent for 6 months.   


Alternatives would be to look to slightly north to Noblesville, or to new construction to the east.  Noblesville has very good schools, but ranked slightly lower than the Fishers area. Slightly east puts you just a few miles farther from Indy with shopping, groceries, etc.. slightly farther away. The other option is to look for an existing home going up for sale in the area and snatch it up before it's sold. I think like a lot of areas, the market is very competitive right now.  


I live near Iron Pointe and like the area a lot. Great schools, friendly neighborhoods, convenient to shopping, food and entertainment.

"The taxes are definitely lower than what you were used to in Brooklyn but there’s still a state income tax, county income tax, and property taxes of course. You won’t pay property tax on your car here though & there’s zero toll roads in Indy. On average, we anticipate our taxes amounting to at least 10-15K less than we were paying on the east coast. That’s **definitely** not nothing but it’s not enough to make up for the wage gap either. It’s possible that if you added up all living costs it *could* make up for the gap, I’m not sure.

"I feel especially qualified to pipe in on this as we just moved here (we’re off Geist, not in a McMansion but it’s a well-built, older large home) from the east coast (CT/NYC area) after basically a two year long multi state search. Yes, home prices have gone up everywhere - my hometown of Austin sees a 15-30% increase each year. The home I sold there for $350K in 2016 is now valued at over $700K. It’s less than 1000 sqft, needs a lot of work, and not even in a great area. When it sells again, it’ll be knocked down & 4 homes will be built in its place. In comparison, we purchased our home here for under $700K, it’s a MUCH better home in every single way possible. In our search, we looked into Chicagoland, Colorado, Portland, Seattle, & moving back to Texas. Everywhere was more expensive than here (some by multitudes) & each came with their own set of unique problems which, at times, felt like major dealbreakers. Of course there is a trade off in everything; Indiana is arguably the least beautiful state we looked at (although I do believe there is a lot of beauty to be found here), and the job market here was the weakest (we both work remotely though so that didn’t matter). We have some family here but also have family/friends spread out amongst the other areas as well. Ultimately, it came down to friendliness (I love humble, kind midwestern folks), cost of living, flexibility/ease of travel, and I believe the Indianapolis area is a solid long-term investment due to climate change issues. There are definitely times I miss living in a bluer part of the country but having lived in both a staunchly red state (TX) & a firmly blue state (CT) I much more prefer a middle ground with varying opinions & backgrounds. Indianapolis is a very practical choice - I highly doubt anyone grows up dreaming to move here some day (I hated visiting family here as a kid), but the city has done a lot to improve its position & invest in arts & lifestyle. Not discouraging you from looking elsewhere, no one should ever feel stuck living somewhere they no longer find joy in.

"Can’t say enough great things about Mandi Gilliland. We did a first year package and I left each session thinking my kid didn’t cooperate and the pictures were going to be meh. Each time I was blown away by the great shots (even when I felt my worst postpartum).

"I'm not seeing how this directly benefits developers. The investment companies are generally buying existing homes. It does limit the supply of homes which raises all home prices, but I don't see it as a give-away to developers.   
I think it's a negative trend to that forces more people into renting as opposed to owning, but it's not easy to restrict people with money buying homes just to rent them.   


The study they reference is very interesting and contains lots of detail about the housing market. To put the issue in perspective over a 5 year period 9.4% of the homes purchased were by non-owner-occupants. Of that 9.4% of sales, 32.7% were purchased by out of state investment firms. So about 3% of the homes sold are being purchased by out of state investment companies. This was 258 homes over a 5 year period. About a 1% shift of the single family homes in Fishers from owner-occupied to remotely-owned rentals.

"The people are great but it really is a get back what you put into it kind of thing.  It is excellent for families with young children.

"I've been in Fishers over 20 years and would still consider it Midwest nice. It's more suburban and more a little status conscious than the typical Midwest, but only a little. For example: we know the names of the cashiers and deli workers of our favorite grocery story. They go out of their way to say hello when we are shopping and we do the same. We were concerned that we hadn't seen our favorite deli lady for several months last year and when my wife ran into her again it was a 15 minute conversation to catch up.  


But it is like a typical suburb, in that you may only see some of your neighbors when they pull in or out of their garage. But it's normal to know at least a few neighbors well enough to borrow tools, help each other on projects, etc..  


We tend to spend most evenings outside in the summer. A screened in porch is nice in late summer because mosquitos can be a nuisance around dusk. Usually just annoying, nothing severe.

But one tradition you are expected to follow if you move to Fishers: Three months after moving here, you must start complaining about how all the construction and growth is ruining Fishers. That it's an absolute travesty that they are turning a field into another neighborhood and making the traffic even worse! (bonus points if your home is less than 5 years old).

"It’s gotten really bad over the past couple of years. They are expanding Noblesville, too. I live over by Morse Reservoir and the whole route thru Noblesville to Fishers has been under construction for the past year. They are turning the old Meijer area into a nice apartment building with various amenities & they’ve got to widen all the streets first. Now you see a lot more construction near Carmel (141st St area) and on 37. I feel like the bulk of it took place last spring, though, and it’s not as bad now.

The other interesting thing from that publication is that the incidence of myocarditis is much higher for someone who contracts SarCov2 than what is caused by the vaccine, thereby supporting the vax stance further.

I hate the downvote mob mentality here, it's hard to have honest open persuasive discussions when honest questions or simple facts get downvote hard.

"It lists a myocarditis incidence of 1-5 events per 100,000 people. So on the high side, a 0.005% chance when getting the vaccine. Note that is the chance of “injury”, not of death. And it also lists the incidence of myocarditis from a COVID infection as 11 out of 100,000. So if all of America got vaccinated, we’d expect based on these numbers to see 3,000-17,000 cases of myocarditis. If all of America caught COVID, we’d expect to see 36,000 cases of myocarditis.

Child Care is expensive.  350 a week seems low for a newborn for 5 days full time but probably not off by much.  My youngest is 3 so i'm a bit out of the newborn care.  For most of your preschools (3+) you're looking at 300ish a week for full time up to some that will be 600 a week.  I recommend looking at some of the churches rather than some of the bigger names as the churches tend to be cheaper and just as good (IMO).

Just fill out the form and they will email you the cost. Expect to pay at least 350 for a newborn. Playschool was one of the more affordable options I saw.

"I recently switched to MetroNet from Comcast (Xfinity). I had the 150Mbps from Comcast and have the 500Mbps from MetroNet.

I'm in an area just south of 96th St that got MetroNet earlier this year.

I already had my own hardware, all Gigabit.

The switch was easy, there were some hiccups with getting my install scheduled but once I called them about it they got it resolved pretty quick. I was one of the first people on my street to get MetroNet so some stuff apparently wasn't setup in the area and that was my delay.

Once the install people came out I had MetroNet is less than 3 hours and some folks came by to bury the cable about a week later.

Speeds are far better, it's also 500Mbps up and down where I had about 150Mbps down and 20Mbps up.

As far as service issues, there was one outage their site said was fixed but was still ongoing for me. I called their tech support and the person confirmed right there on the phone he saw the issue still going on for me. He couldn't give me an ETA on a fix, but it ended up being about 2 hours.

Their support team are all based in the US as far as I know and have been helpful the few times I have called.

"As someone who did this move from Southaven/Hernando to Fishers a couple years ago, I hope I can provide you some helpful insight about Fishers.  My wife is WFH with freedom to be located anywhere in the US and I am a stay-at-home dad, so to be honest, I can’t really comment on the job market- other than like everywhere we need nurses and subs.  The last 2 years in Hamilton Southeastern Schools have seen significant turnover of staff and record highs of retirements/resignations, so the odds of your wife finding something comparable are better than you’d think.

The housing market in Fishers is like most areas- bids and buys within a day or 2.  Most of the single family home neighborhoods in the “starter home” price range will have a fair number of renters, but for the most part you’re dealing with young families, not college/party kids.

The schools in Fishers (comparatively to DCS/Hernando) are a lot further ahead than the metrics indicate, but not light years.  There might be some struggles/adjustment time as your daughter gets caught up to HSE standards, but we’re talking weeks, not years.  Extracurricular activities for elementary are slim- most official things don’t start until 3rd or 4th grade.  But there are quite a few third party services available to help your kid explore the extracurricular activities- Mudsock, YMCA, etc.

As for traffic, I-69 can be as bad, and just as randomly as I-55 at Goodman or Church road.  116th street is comparable to Goodman, but for the most part a lot less stressful, as there are many more neighborhoods directly off the road, versus solid Southaven’s significant commercial usage.

Much like there, Kroger is the main supermarket.  Depending on the area you choose, there will also be a Meijer nearby.  Our Targets and Walmarts also have groceries.

School systems are some of the best in the state and crime is not very common outside of the car break ins.  Houses have gone up in price.

Full Disclosure - I moved to Noblesville 2005 and don't regret it a bit out of the choices.

The only place I would possibly consider moving to would be Zionsville",t2_5f2y4ekt,NetworkEngIndy,0,1632246119.0,0,t1_hdqrr0w,hdqrr0w,True,Bud_Tuglee,t3_psmf5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fishers/comments/psmf5z/moving_to_the_area_within_the_next_year_from/,Moving to the area within the next year from North Mississippi,/r/Fishers/comments/psmf5z/moving_to_the_area_within_the_next_year_from/hdqrr0w/,-1,r/Fishers,0,-1
"The neighborhoods are all pretty good quality. That said, there are a lot of renters purchasing homes so there is a mix of residents. Some young, some old.   
As for jobs we have a few local big names. You're in medicine so you might check Lilly. It is on the edge of downtown so commute isn't ideal. There are also other big name companies in the area that are closer. Siemens, Johnson Controls, and Stanley to name a few.

"In Fishers and Carmel area the crap neighborhoods are very few. You will pay a price because of this. Noblesville is still nice but more small country town look and feel to it. Because of this, you can get more home for less money there. Ultimately I'd say be sure you use Google street view when checking a house for sale.

As for a job, you should look at Roche. They are very close to Fishers and seem to be in your field.

They also claim to be a very open church, but then speak out harshly against things like abortion or LGBTQ when the topic comes up. They would do some great things with money, like donating educational supplies to locations with poor school systems in the world.. But they'd only provide that support if the schools taught a faith-based curriculum. Finally, when the pandemic came they fought Hard to stay open, despite already having the infrastructure to stream every service live online. They tried to stay open, then when that got stopped they implemented a ticket system and broke the building into a bunch of different 'rooms' where you could come with 10 other people to stay within limits and watch the service together. So hundreds were in the building, but each 'room' was technically holding to the law. 

That was pretty much the straw the broke the camel's back for my family. It seemed pretty socially irresponsible for such a large church to not take the pandemic seriously, and coupled with the other red flags we saw we decided to stop attending. We're still looking for a new church if anyone has suggestions.",t2_62k85,NoNoveltyNeeded,0,1629119338.0,0,t1_h95i1y5,h95i1y5,False,NoNoveltyNeeded,t3_p4wnvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fishers/comments/p4wnvp/public_hearing_regarding_itown_land/,Public Hearing regarding itown land?,/r/Fishers/comments/p4wnvp/public_hearing_regarding_itown_land/h95i1y5/,4,r/Fishers,0,4

"(This is all dependent on the show being at Deer Creek/Verizon/Some mortgage company - whatever it's called this year.)

Depends on your age. Ale emporium is the best wings I've ever had and probably the best beer selection in the area. I highly recommend it for that alone. But it's very much a pub. It's always packed, but there's two of them. The one on Olio Rd is family-friendly and set up almost exactly like a BW3 - mostly tables with a small bar. The one on Allisonville and 465 is 21+ and is more of a bar with some tables around it.

As someone else mentioned, Britton tavern (at least when I was there last, YEARS ago) was a mid-20s pub that turned into a club scene the later it got.

The area around top golf (116th & 69) has quite a few places. At that time of night, I'm not 100% what will be open.

Finally, right outside of the venue is Hamilton Town Center. It has quite a few restaurants that I would suspect would stay open longer on concert nights as the entire area sprung up solely because of the concerts.",t2_b7mz5,Zebov3,0,1627824870.0,0,t1_h7b8job,h7b8job,True,MattChicago1871,t3_oviphk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fishers/comments/oviphk/best_place_to_hang_out_at_night_after_phish/,Best Place to Hang out at Night after Phish?,/r/Fishers/comments/oviphk/best_place_to_hang_out_at_night_after_phish/h7b8job/,1,r/Fishers,0,1

"Great question. I'm sort.of wracking my brain here because I don't know many things open late in Noblesville/Fishers. That's a three day show, right? I think they usually end around 11pm. I work at the fire station just down the street from the venue.  There's Books and Brews in Hamilton Town Center, which is just down the street, but I think they close at midnight. 1933 Lounge at The Yard is open until midnight. Across the street is Top Golf which is open late.  Ale Emporium on Olio road is another choice. Go to downtown Noblesville to Syd's for a dive bar experience.  Open late but a drive from the concert.  If you want to be out after midnight you'd have more luck heading to Broadripple or Mass Ave in Indy.

Fort Harrison has a dog park and walking area that you will encounter lots of dogs and people.

"If you’re buying a home, be very aggressive. It’s a sellers market for anything under $700k. Home in my neighborhood was listed at $445k. Sold to an out of state buyer for $517k with no inspection. 

Friends of mine sold their house. Listed at $225k and sold for $245k cash offer no inspection. 

You may want to rent for a year if you think the market will change. I personally don’t think it will because Indiana is such an attractive real estate market with low property taxes capped at 2%. 

Job market is good right now. Most of the north side is being aggressive trying to recruit large businesses.

"My wife and I are your age.  Our kids grew up here and we love the city.  I have always felt very safe here.  As a city population grows, there is obviously more crime.  But like 1 murder in the whole year is quite a surprise to the community.   It’s still a very low crime city, and as long as you practice common sense, your chances of being victimized is very low.

With the shortage of homes and increasing prices, expect average homes to run $100-125/sf.   

Speaking from someone in their 50s with a laidback lifestyle, I feel there is plenty of things for us to do and lots of restaurant.  In the summer, they have free outside amphitheater concerts every week. 

Diversity has gotten better, but you’re not going to see concentrated pockets of ethnic groups in Fishers like you might see in L.A.  

As long as you don’t expect the California weather and beaches, I think you’ll love it here.  And I hope you do keep Fishers on your list of places to relocate.

"Don't listen to the previous comment, Fishers is a great area. [Neighborhooscout.com](https://Neighborhooscout.com) shows it as a crime index of 68 out of 100. Safer than 68% of US cities. Crime rate is 1/7 of the average of Indiana. California has a higher crime rate than Indiana as an example.

"I live in Fishers but have a job in supply chain in Noblesville (adjacent suburb) and I’m constantly getting hit up on LinkedIn, so I’d say the job market is good. 

Cost of living here is definitely lower than pretty much anywhere in Cali, so I doubt you’ll be balking at home prices, gas prices, etc. What you might miss from Cali: vegan restaurants (we don’t really have them); a wide variety of really fresh, relatively cheap produce (although the farmer’s market is pretty good for seasonal stuff); the year-round warmth (we definitely get four seasons, but for half of the year it’s either ungodly hot or ungodly cold). Also, while we’re (slowly) changing, Indiana’s a red state, and it seems like there’s megachurches cropping up everywhere. Definitely not as liberal as California, for better or worse.
