Good news is that there are a few billionaires here and the county could make a deal with one, in exchange for the investment. 

The idea is that WE are our government and we can do whatever we want. There just needs to be unity and intention and action. 

There are many ways to pay for it. The tourism industry can pay for it very easily. We already have too much people want to come here so just charge what needs to be charged to pay for it, via a tourist fee, and get a loan based on the new income from fee. Not that difficult.

"A couple ideas:

-Koa is an important wood to the Hawaiian people and many rings have a Koa inlay. Like this one I randomly Google: https://www.happylaulea.com/products/black-hi-tech-ceramic-ring-with-blue-opal-hawaiian-koa-wood-inlay-8mm-width-comfort-fitment?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5dPH2t7N9gIVyz6tBh0RRwOKEAQYDSABEgJooPD_BwE

-you could get some red dirt to represent the land, some Koa or other wood to represent the mountains/forest, and something blue to represent the ocean. Maybe add in something else from your life together or something from where you live to tie it all together. 

-sorry I'm not a wood worker or jewelry maker so I don't know what materials would be best but you could also ask in r/Hawaii for wood or other inlay ideas or ask on other jewelry making forums

-I'm not Hawaiian so I don't want to speak for kanaka but the kapu/taboo lore around taking things from Hawaii I think mostly applies to tourists or haoles without Aloha. I think as long as you take/buy a few small things for a ring from the islands to honor your future husband then I think you are doing the right thing and have Aloha in your heart which is all that matters.

It did not do the only thing it was FDA-approved to do.

- then 6 months later with proof of more people dying on vents than not we saw this was a systemic and prob vascular disease vs a respiratory disease and everyone wanted Not to be placed on a vent‚Ä¶.

"Wow. I‚Äôm surprised how far I had to scroll down to see a logical comment regarding Felicia. Not only is she the only full time council person, she‚Äôs also the only woman. 

For those asking if she‚Äôs for ‚ÄúRussia or Ukraine‚Äù I spoke to her last week. She‚Äôs definitely for the people that are being bombed & illegally occupied, same as is she is here. So many ‚Äúfree thinkers‚Äù in here that are obviously divided (as intended) but all the media diarrhea‚Ä¶ Sad. 

Felicia discusses so much with civility & of course it gets used against her because so many other of our politicians (insert Kawakami) play the strong middle fence to keep their jobs & appease the majority, lobbyists & squeaky wheels that want all the grease. I‚Äôll continue to vote for this woman because she brings something we are severely missing; compassion & the ability to have open discussion. We ALL are all often ‚Äúwrong‚Äù about things & yet, because she looks different or people like to project their own bullshit on her & others, she gets way too much heat for having the courage to have a fucking opinion. She is very often serving the community & our People & has no problem being wrong & getting literally dirty. 

So fucking what if she wants to question a newly developed vaccine or made a mistake by traveling to Russia? I will vote for her because ironically being the only woman on the council, she seems to be the only one with the balls to be wrong, have open discussion about very important items that most of our politicians like to ignore & take a stand against the massive occupation of wealthy land owners, skyrocketing real estate prices, pollution of our Lands & other atrocious acts that continue to destroy our People, culture & Aina.",t2_9o04kxq3,UnFuckinRealBrah,0,1646933792.0,0,t1_i04qp6d,i04qp6d,False,groovychick,t3_ta3h33,https://www.reddit.com/r/kauai/comments/ta3h33/feds_accuse_founder_of_russiaus_cultural_exchange/,Feds Accuse Founder Of Russia-U.S. Cultural Exchange Group Of Being A Russian Spy - this was the woman who was lobbying Felicia Cowden and invited her to Russia‚Ä¶more info in article.,/r/kauai/comments/ta3h33/feds_accuse_founder_of_russiaus_cultural_exchange/i04qp6d/,1,r/kauai,0,1

According to Cowden, she was approached by the FBI prior to the trip. They wanted her to attend as some sort of double agent (my words, not hers.) She wasn't comfortable spying on her Russian friends, so she passed along the post-it note mentioned in the Star Advertiser article.

>Within that card was a handwritten two-sided Post-it note, shown on the left side of the image. In that note, Councilmember-1 appears to have written, ‚ÄúI am not coming or communicating because I am being watched. It feels wrong for me to be involved that way‚Äù and, on the back of the note, ‚ÄúIt is on the American side,‚Äù according to the federal charging document.

To be clear: ***Cowden told a Russian agent that they were being watched by the FBI.***

"The major problem is the roosters crowing at all hours of the night. They roost in trees, which many times are right outside your bedroom window. If someone in the neighborhood gets up to pee and flips a light on, the roosters think the sun is coming up and they start going ape shit and cockadoodledoo for 15-20 minutes. This causes a trickle effect, because one starts going off, the other roosters within ear shot think they're missing the party, so they start going off too. 

The secondary issues are the filth they carry, and get in and around your food if you're at a beach/park/camp ground. 

They target dog food, cat food, farm/ranch feed, dig up gardens, poop in carports, on vehicles, frequently fly across the road and damage cars/trucks driving by. Dogs and cats chase them into the road and end up getting ran over as a result of chasing the chickens. 

They can also pass on bird related viruses to domestic chickens, compete with native birds for resources.

"Are you targeting fresh water or salt water fish? 

The answer will be about the same either way, fly fishing is sight fishing for the most part right? As in the fish need to be able to see the fly. You will be limited to wherever the weather/ocean decides to be clean that day. 

Sometimes the ocean will be shit, sometimes the streams will be shit. Ironically, fresh water is where you need to have a license to fish, and it's stocked fish in dirty water. The ocean has much better options for edible fish, and the chance to catch monsters. Bonefish, bluefin trevally, threadfin, barracuda, amberjacks to name a few. Your success will largely be determined by the weather. Low wind and clear water is what you need to seek out.",t2_5jw1tt15,22Hoofhearted,0,1645498705.0,0,t1_hxx17jh,hxx17jh,True,Basil98765,t3_sy0mmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/kauai/comments/sy0mmc/fly_fishing/,Fly Fishing,/r/kauai/comments/sy0mmc/fly_fishing/hxx17jh/,3,r/kauai,0,3

"This was shot around 930pm on September 1st 2022. I'd suggest getting the photo pills app to help plan milkyway photography adventures. For any camera I'd suggest a fast aperture between. F1.2-2.8  will work. These were my settings using a 15mm f2.4 lens on my nikon d810. Shoot in manual mode only when doing these kind of shots. First step is focusing the lens at infinity or zoom in on a star using your back screen and focus the lens on a star until it looks sharp. Then if possible lock the focus ring. I was using a Irix 15mm f2.4 it's a full manual lens. I shot this shot at ISO 6400, 15 second  shutter speed, auto white balance, only shoot in raw and shot at the fastest aperture my lens could do which was f2.4. Just use the rule of thumb on shutter speed which is 500/focal length of lens=proposed shutter speed. I used a faster speed than I am allowed with the 15mm as it seems to do perfect at that amount. If you go longer than the rule of thumb you take a chance of getting stars to streak. So for example 500/50mm=10 seconds. Hope this helps.

"KCL (Korean , Chinese, Local) next to Tony‚Äôs Bar in Lihue?  The plate lunch place?  Good food, but my spoon came up with a big boiled roach in my oxtail soup when I was about 2/3 of the way through the bowl.   I go to other casual local food places now if that‚Äôs what I want.  Happy Talk at Hanalei Bay Resort has been closed for years now, I‚Äôm pretty sure.  
I would say for romantic ambiance, Hyatt Tidepools, Beach House, Gaylord‚Äôs,  Red Salt, or maybe even the restaurant at Poipu Sheraton whatever it‚Äôs called now for that romantic feel.   I live on the west side, so I‚Äôm sticking to Lihue and Southshore recommendations. But Postcards in Hanalei has that special occasion ambiance to it.  St Regis is closed, but that had some really beautiful fine dining.  Also Keokis in Poipu for tropical tiki torch ambiance.  Can also get served dinner in your own private Gazeebo right on the beach at the Hyatt or Royal Sonesta (Lihue Marriott) or at Kauai Beach Resort, but that level is going to cost you some kala.",t2_beqxyt2z,HI-Walrus-1502,0,1645349477.0,0,t1_hxoprsy,hxoprsy,False,sawagner94,t3_swlogr,https://www.reddit.com/r/kauai/comments/swlogr/aloha_my_fianc√©_and_i_are_eloping_in_kauai_and/,Aloha!

"Kauai is like a small town.  No night life.  We just go drink at the beach.  If you are single it can be hard to meet people to date.  Only 70k people here and most are seniors.  There is limited selection of goods and services.  Only 2 gas stations on the Northshore and if you don't get gas by 7pm you have to go 40 miles to the only open one.  There used to be only one movie theater on island but that went out of business during covid. Sometimes you can't find the products you want to buy because the stores don't carry it.  But there is always online shopping.  Most business close by 7 or 8pm and the only restaurant open pass 10pm is McDonald's. 

There is some racial animosity towards Caucasians.  The majority of Hawaiians are friendly and down to Earth people but there is around 10% that don't like white people as they blame them for ""stealing"" their land and diminishing their culture. The white kids that grew up here all said they were bullied by locals in schools, many were beaten up. And of course food, gas and housing costs are higher here than in the mainland. Rental prices are way overpriced. Those are the drawbacks. 

But It's a beautiful place.  The weather is almost always nice. Beautiful beaches and hiking.  Great biking and running paths on the east side. There is no winter season really just a rainy season. Great gardening and farmer's markers. 

But be aware that many locals don't want mainlanders to move here but it's  the state with the longest live expectancy out of all 50.

"I don't think it was a balloon, they're just throwing smoke. How could a balloon sit in exactly the same place for close to two hours?? 

If it was an unmanned unknown balloon in Hawaiian airspace they would have shot it down, no question. 

I watched it for almost two hours through my telescope and it didn't budge one bit, it was a huge white sphere, a lot larger than the aircraft they scrambled. 

As the sun went down it turned golden and looked like it was on fire then it gradually faded out, still sitting motionless in the same spot. 

Was hard to focus my phone camera through my small spotting scope, these are the best few frames I could manage.

"I think it's big difference when the owners of the lands willingly invite people to come and live in their lands and share their country as equals , as opposed to people coming and taking it by force. The Hawaiian people suffer from very high rates of poverty and homelessness , and he more people come and stay in expensive hotels the more that increases. At same time hawaiian people rely on tourism , and the people in the monastery have been living alongside locals on their piece of land for 50 years now , making it alot less commercial and commodified than the resorts , hotels , expensive b n b's and rich expats.

"It has been a US Territory since 1898. It has been a state for more than 50 years. There is a vocal minority that contest the legality of its annexation, but that does not mean that it was illegally overthrown. 

Typically the illegal annexation argument rests on three points.
1. Congress has no authority to annex territory through legislation
 2. The annexation violated international law
3. There was no treaty of annexation.

Each of these three claims does not stack up in the face of analysis.

To the first point, in 1790 the federal Congress passed legislation to annex a section of North Carolina. The state of North Carolina had asked for the federal government to do this. The legislation was passed in the territory was annexed with no constitutional dispute. Later in the 19th century the United States passed legislation to annex several uninhabited islands, this annexation was also upheld as legitimate. It was years later that Hawaii would be annexed by legislation. The precedent had been established two other times in our history by which Congress was in fact capable of annexing territory through legislation. The first point does not hold water upon close analysis. 

To the second point, the supreme Court has upheld numerous times as late as 1904 that conquest is a legal means by which the United States can annex territory. It was also held as a valid means under international law in the 19th century. The second point does not hold up to close analysis.

To the third point, I am just going to paste here, because it sums it up very well. ""signing two different documents with the same intent--annexation--might 
be unorthodox, but under the international law of treaties, it was not void. Both documents 
were ‚Äúrelated.‚Äù They were almost identical, which certainly meets the standard to evidence 
an agreement. There did not have to be a single, written document, since even notes passed 
between states can suffice to form a binding international agreement.
In sum, there was an agreement between Hawaii and the US: Hawaii and the US 
intended to be bound by the agreement, and the Senate approved the agreement by a two-
thirds vote.""

Each of the three traditional points used to justify illegal occupation simply does not hold up when viewed through the lens of international politics in the 19th century, as well as precedent of the United States and other nations. The government that represented Hawaii and created the treaty with the United States was the valid government of Hawaii at the time. The people of Hawaii may not have been happy about it, but nowhere in international law at the time did it say that people must be in accordance with their government on matters such as annexation. 

In short, even without all this evidence, the united states recognizes Hawaii as a state. Hawaii recognizes itself as a state. The International community recognizes Hawaii as a state. A small minority of some Hawaiians do not.

I'm sure you know friends and families that go to the mainland or elsewhere for school/vacation/visit family whatever. Which is fine, humans are naturally nomadic and want to travel and explore. 

It just so happens that Kauai is paradise on earth and unfortunately there's a price associated with that. People from the mainland can't buy houses and property if the locals aren't selling. Last I heard, uncle Billy and the county council were pushing to reclaim some property that has been sitting empty to build some affordable housing. What ""affordable"" actually means in today's market could be scary, who knows.

"Best to walk through the process with the planning department or with a land use attorney. 

You should be able to petition the planning commission any time for a zoning amendment. If they approve it, it goes to the county council for final approval. It‚Äôs definitely a process though. Check out sec 8-3.4 of the county code. 

There shouldn‚Äôt be any open zoned parcels less than 1 acre though. Is it part of a larger residentially zoned property with just a small portion zoned open? Or CPRed off a larger lot?

It‚Äôs a discretionary process, so chances of success are hard to judge. But approval or rejection of the amendment will largely be based on whether it conforms with the policies in the general plan and whether the neighbors are good with it.

"I getcha. There's definitely some cultural differences here, and I also understand the association of machetes with barbarism/charged violence. The first time the guy I'm seeing called himself a ""machete-wielding local"" it caught me WAY off guard. It does have the trappings of a dog-whistle. (I'm still never going to call him that, tbh)

It's tough too because this one does sound like a misunderstanding... but  also I completely understand the vigilance. Haven't been through the systemic racism (I am one of those blonde chicks) but have definitely had the experience of being like ""wait was that incredibly sexist? Probably not, right? Best laugh it off..."" and then later down the line realizing no, that was genuinely messed up and now I wish I'd stood up for myself for a lot of reasons. As well as having people talk about how it's just a joke, no big deal, blah blah, when sure as a one-off it's usually probably whatever, but the pattern is exhausting and sometimes dangerous for me personally as well as being really crappy for the world at large, and at some point we gotta do \*something\* to draw a line \*somewhere\*... and occasionally getting a little prickly at the wrong times myself.

"I am definitely not trying to tell you how you should feel here. 

If I can add a little bit of context to the machete comment, though. Like you say, context is important. I can see why that would seem racist in a particular way. And it may very well have been.

It‚Äôs also a really common joke/reality here, in my experience. Not like, people waving around machetes on a daily basis, but for example there‚Äôs a couple outside my room right now for keeping the plants in check.

When I go camping alone someone *always* jokes to bring a machete. Going to Kalalau in a group of 4 people? A machete will somehow materialize, even if no one uses it. I literally found a decent-condition machete while out walking a while back.

I had never touched one living on the mainland but here it‚Äôs a good thing to have if you garden/have trees and I even find myself thinking oh shoot, I forgot the machete and this broken branch on the trail could really hurt someone‚Ä¶
