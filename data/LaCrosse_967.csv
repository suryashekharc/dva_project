"Responses for candidates running for **District 30** are below:

&#x200B;

Dustin Frost

Age: 38

Education: Not given

Occupation: Husband/Father, Insurance Producer, Assistant Wrestling Coach, Class A Commercial DriverPolitical experience: Active follower of local, state, national and international news and politics; no political offices held.

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

I believe District 30, the town of Shelby, does not have strong enough representation on the board. The Executive Committee, six of the nine members are from the city of La Crosse and there are no rural members. I would like to see the town of Shelby and other townships/municipalities have a seat on this committee.I would like to set goals for improving our roads, bridges, and overall infrastructure of the county, especially in all rural settings. We have had heavy rains recently that create washouts on roads in my district, I would like to see permanent fixes instead of patches.One of my other main goals is to support public safety while on the board. I will represent the town of Shelby and I believe the township and all other townships and municipalities can take care of their own public safety responders, which includes their own police departments. They do not need La Crosse County creating a police oversight to encompass all the townships and municipalities.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

Hands down, this should be used to help improve the infrastructure of La Crosse County. This is a one-time source of monies. There are many needs in our county but setting up permanent new programs that will need to be supported financially for years to come will only put pressure on the taxpayers of the county in the years after these monies run out.By investing in clean water, roads, bridges, and infrastructure we can make improvements that last for decades without burdening the taxpayer. I was amazed that none of the funding went to the town of Campbell to help with the PFAS issue in the wells of those homeowners. Our county government should have helped. Especially when the ARPA funding specifically says it can be used for clean water. It seems very little of the ARPA money will be spent in rural La Crosse County and we have serious needs for broadband expansion, road repairs and support for first responders.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

I believe we need to have multiple inputs from multiple townships and municipalities. Meaning we need to have representation from these different townships and municipalities on all committees. Critical thinking, disagreements and different viewpoints usually breed best practices and outcomes. As I mentioned above regarding the Executive Committee, it is not appropriate to have a committee dominated by one municipality. We all have to do our part to represent our constituents. The La Crosse County Board cannot do that if we don’t have a seat at the table. I will work with other representatives from other rural districts to ensure our needs are met.

Political experience: First-time candidate but long-interested and -involved in the issues

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

As a third-generation teacher and public servant, I believe deeply in service, learning, and collaboration. For years I’ve considered political representation; now, with an open seat in District 30, and after learning more and more about our county, I am ready to step into this role. I was born and raised in La Crosse, and, every day, I work with the county’s systems and services. Not only am I invested in this community but I also see what it is and can be. This vision, which is really a shared one, includes sustainability and energy independence, better work and education opportunities for all of our residents, and support for our neighbors who are struggling in one way or another. I intend to make informed decisions on issues that matter to all of us. I will be a responsible representative who listens, builds relationships, and helps make our county better.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

First, I appreciate the process that the County Board used to form the categories, deliberately seeking community-member input through multiple channels. In that way it made the most of this unique funding opportunity. All of the categories are critical, including childcare, housing, trades training, and infrastructure. That said, I believe the most important ARPA-funded projects fall within the sustainability category. County solar investments will help reduce emissions, and green infrastructure will help manage the increasingly severe impacts of climate change, particularly heavy rains and flooding. Following experts, I think we need to act now to start drawing down our emissions level. I also believe that government can and should be a leader in implementing these kinds of proactive, win-win solutions that lead to not just sustainability but also workforce development and deeper community collaboration.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

Representation matters. I intend to show up at town meetings when possible and engage in dialogue to ensure that county and township are in contact, working together. Similarly, I think housing, sustainability, infrastructure, and other projects provide fertile ground for governmental collaboration and, more specifically, resource-sharing. The issues that matter in Shelby often show up in other municipalities, and only by working together can we find viable solutions for our township, county, and community.",t2_55479v0b,THOTness_monster,0,1648142689.0,0,t1_i1yeh5f,i1yeh5f,True,THOTness_monster,t3_th5cce,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/th5cce/where_can_i_find_information_on_the_local/,Where can I find information on the local candidates running for office?

Gary Padesky (i)

Political experience: Six years on La Crosse Common Council and two years on the La Crosse County Board

**The county is continuing to evaluate creating a police oversight committee. Do you think the county is in need of such a committee and could benefit from it? Why or why not?**

First I would like to say, I have family and friends (past and present) who are in law enforcement. But I do believe we need the committee so we can open up the lines of communication for people who need a safe place to report problems they have experienced. Also with law enforcement on the committee we can get a better understanding of both sides of the experience. The best thing that will come out of this committee will be much needed conversation and communication which is always a good thing. I feel everyone involved should give this committee a chance to help improve the relationship between the public and the police.

**Both candidates running for District 7 have experience on the board. What about serving on the county board keeps you coming back, and what unfinished business do you think there is for you as a county supervisor?**

As far as what unfinished business, I would like to continue to keep the movement going on better collaboration between city and county to save all taxpayers money. I think we can do a better job of helping expand our La Crosse MTU to branch out to serve more people in need of this service. I would like to see the county involved on a possible new museum, we still have floodplain issues, PFAS issues to name a few. I really want to serve another term to continue to help people achieve a better way of life, which includes a nice place to live, opportunities in career training, taking care of our aging population. La Crosse County is a beautiful, giving community of which I am proud of. I have always worked in some type of customer service related jobs. I understand the importance of helping, communicating and working with people on different problems. I love feeling that I am helping with that. Thank you for considering me to serve you two more years.

**The county is continuing to evaluate creating a police oversight committee. Do you think the county is in need of such a committee and could benefit from it? Why or why not?**

I spent several years on the Criminal Justice Management Council, researching and instituting programs that focused on treatment rather than punishment. The rate of recidivism indicated that the current system of imprisonment was not effective.

The Council was made up of representatives from every area of the justice system, including law enforcement, judges, county staff, county board members, Justice Sanctions, Probation and Parole, the District Attorney, Public Defenders, and the public. We researched evidence-based practices before starting a program. Results included treatment courts, such as Drug Court, OWI Court, and Veterans’ Court, each of which used community programs and county staff to help find a better solution than imprisonment. We also created Ophelia’s House for non-violent female offenders, added more mental health services in the jail, and a variety of Justice Sanctions that focused on treatment. All of these created better results than jail, returning many people to society as productive citizens.

With the pandemic, incidents of police brutality came to light and received international coverage. While none of these incidents had occured in La Crosse County, it was felt that an oversight board would help establish standards and practices that would prevent them from happening here. This was not meant to cripple law enforcement, but rather to help them continue to provide effective, fair treatment.

**Both candidates running for District 7 have experience on the board. What about serving on the county board keeps you coming back, and what unfinished business do you think there is for you as a county supervisor?**

During my 18 years on the board, I became involved with many aspects of local government, including Health and Human Services, aging and nursing homes, building projects, economic development, sustainability, diversity, public health preparedness, libraries, and even zoning and highways. I was especially passionate about health and human services. I served on, and was chair of the Health and Human Services Board for several years. I also went beyond county borders and was elected to and served on a state and national board of health, rising to president of each. I worked on clean air, clean water, child protective services, juvenile justice, and veterans services.

I feel as if I left much work unfinished. I have more energy to put towards forward-thinking programs. I showed leadership by chairing multiple committees and being elected by the board as First Vice Chair for six years. I led public hearings on controversial topics, in which I was yelled and sworn at, and threatened. I believe local government requires action, not just attending three mandatory meetings a month.

"It's better to rent from individual landlords (people, not big property companies) if you can.  I rented for \~12 years before buying my first house, and IME the difference is night and day in how they treat you.

The way property management companies work is that they normally don't own the properties they're renting.  They earn a percentage of your rent, typically 10%, in exchange for collecting your rent, handling your lease, and calling maintenance people when shit happens.

So you're paying $1,000/month and they're only getting $100/month from it (compared to a landlord who's keeping \~$250 of it after maintenance/tax/insurance/interest).  They're not going to lose much if you're unhappy and the place goes vacant, nor do they have a financial interest in keeping the property in good shape long-term.  Plus, they have a hundred other tenants to deal with, and they're only making a profit if they spend as little time dealing with you as possible.

Renting from actual people, it's often married couples who poured their life savings into one or two little places to rent out.  If you pay your rent on time and take care of the place, they'll want to keep you there for years and will be very accommodating.",t2_6d470,Josh1billion,0,1647990835.0,0,t1_i1q5xv8,i1q5xv8,True,erminefurs,t3_tk6bj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/tk6bj4/are_there_any_good_rental_agencies_in_the_area/,Are there any good rental agencies in the area?,/r/lacrossewi/comments/tk6bj4/are_there_any_good_rental_agencies_in_the_area/i1q5xv8/,3,r/lacrossewi,0,3

"I live on the south side, but I go to the trouble to take my cars to a one person shop in Onalaska called Bollum auto. He worked at the famous Conway auto before opening up on his own when Conway went on a hiatus for a couple of years, so he has good experience with imports and domestic. I completely trust him and think he’s a great guy.

What really sold me on the guy was one of the first times I was doing business with him, I was just leaving his shop when a teenager or very young adult guy walks in with his fishing pole and said he can’t get into his car, which was parked somewhere nearby, in the area of the spillway where everybody fishes. Bollum just hopped up and walked out of his shop with the kid to see what the problem was. I thought it showed a really pleasant eagerness to help, and it gave me a very good impression.

Another anecdote: he put new tires on one of my old beat up cars, but told me to go elsewhere when I needed tires for my car with really good rims. He said his machine might scratch the rims, and on my old beater car with steel rims and hubcaps it doesn’t matter, but on this car he’d rather give up the business than risk scratching the rims. 

I doubt he has all the computer stuff that bigger shops and dealerships have, but for the basics and bigger jobs (like your engine job) on maybe not brand-new cars, I think he can’t be beat.",t2_okb7o,stooftheoof,0,1647976780.0,0,t1_i1p6seg,i1p6seg,True,ginnydebt,t3_tk3mon,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/tk3mon/auto_repair_shop_recommendations/,Auto repair shop recommendations,/r/lacrossewi/comments/tk3mon/auto_repair_shop_recommendations/i1p6seg/,1,r/lacrossewi,0,1

Monica Kruse (i)

Age: 71

Education: BA/MA German Linguistics/Literature, Spanish—University of Colorado-Boulder; MS Special Education—University of Wisconsin-La Crosse

Occupation: Teacher, University Supervisor

Political experience: Legislative liaison—Wisconsin Education Association/Coulee Region United Educators; County Board Supervisor since 2009, County Board Chair since April 2020

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

I greatly appreciate the opportunity to serve the citizens of this county and want to ensure that the good work our County Board is doing continues. I want our county to remain the vibrant, beautiful place that it is by investing in legacy-building projects that will enhance our safety and create sustainable prosperity for all. Thanks to smart financial planning and responsible stewardship, La Crosse County is currently in the best fiscal shape it’s been in several decades. We have the 5th lowest tax rate of all 72 WI counties. Our debt load is among the lowest in the state. All that, while we’re aggressively investing in upgrading our highways, bridges and other infrastructure and embarking on a complete restructuring of our Hillview facility. I want to maintain that trajectory into the future. The County Board last year passed a resolution declaring racism a public health crisis and subsequently created a committee to address inequalities in our community. I am excited to see that effort through and make ours an equitable county where all citizens are valued, nurtured and encouraged to reach their full potential. I firmly believe this is a prerequisite for all the other good things we want to accomplish.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

The purpose of the ARPA funding is to help America’s counties, cities, municipalities and other public entities address the economic devastation of the pandemic and emerge not battered and diminished, but empowered to revitalize our local economies and continue stronger and healthier than before. La Crosse County has endeavored to be smart and systematic in the process we’ve used to determine priorities, leverage other funding, collaborate with our neighbors where advantageous, and create transformational projects that will position us for growth and prosperity far into the future. Emphasis has been placed on creating affordable housing for all to eliminate homelessness and blighted neighborhoods, workforce development in the form of affordable childcare options and skilled trades training to make it possible and profitable for all who are able to join the workforce; investments in sustainable stormwater infrastructure to prepare for extreme weather events and county solar installations to help reach our goal of becoming carbon-free by 2050. All are interrelated and equally important in our quest to become the best county in Wisconsin!

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

One of my top goals as your County Board Chair has been to create greater collaboration with our neighbors both urban and rural. To that end, there have been regular meetings to discuss common goals and priorities with the mayors and village president of La Crosse, Onalaska and Holmen. It’s been my pleasure to regularly attend the Town’s Association meetings to make connections with the chairs of the towns in the county and find opportunities for collaboration and cooperation. I’ve made it a priority to appoint representatives from the towns to the Comprehensive Plan Committee, the Redistricting Committee and other groups that chart the county’s direction for years to come. We have worked closely with the mayor of La Crosse to address the problems of homelessness, substance abuse and mental illness. We have collaborated with representatives from all our healthcare facilities throughout the pandemic to share expertise, coordinate services and create economies of scale that avoid duplication and waste. There is strength in numbers and nobility in reaching out — both with a helping hand and to ask for help.

Age: 51

Education: Bachelor of Science in Psychobiology, Environmental Biology Minor from Ripon College, UW-Oshkosh Graduate school for Special Education

Occupation: My experiences include environmental education and special education. I worked for the Oneida Nation as a Native American Student Advocate. Currently I am a Homeschool Educator.

Political experience: I would be a new voice and bring new perspectives. I like to network and bring people together for the betterment of our community and for the future generations.

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

I want to serve because I believe our county has several issues that need to be addressed. Our debt, cost of living, and drinking water issues all need immediate attention. We also need to take action on fixing our roads. As Supervisor I would communicate with constituents by listening and responding to any questions, concerns, and comments regarding county board actions, discussion, and financial decisions.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

My research showed that ARPA money could be used on “investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure.” I would have voted to allocate this money go towards those in the county with contaminated well water because of the PFAS situation. However we end up spending this money, if we think of it as spending our children’s money, we will use it wisely, sustainably, and with accountability.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

In order to improve collaboration with municipalities I think the Executive Committee should have a more diverse cross section of supervisors from both urban and rural districts. Diversity of this committee will provide better solutions overall on budget spending, policy making, etc. Diversity is a strength when we work together for a common goal.

I would do my part by keeping open communication with elected officials in the City of Onalaska and attending meetings when possible. I want to see all municipalities in our county thriving.

"Responses for candidates running for **District 24** are below:

&#x200B;

Kevin Hoyer (i)

Age: Not given

Education: Business management, sales management, marketing, environmental studies, economics, sustainability, domestic policy

Occupation: My wife, Jody, and I own and operate our family farm, which has been in the family for three generations in the town of Hamilton. I also am an agronomist (Certified Crop Advisor) for Melrose Farm Service, a local Ag retailer for over 32 years.

Political experience: Presently I am serving in my second term as the 24th district county supervisor along with serving in my third term as the Town of Hamilton Supervisor. I also have 13 years (2003-2016) of experience serving on the State and National American Soybean Association Boards (a Grass Roots Ag Policy Organization), representing the farmers of Wisconsin in state and national rural policy.

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

Four years ago, I decided to run for county board because I felt that the citizens of the 24th district needed a voice that represented them to the county board, not the other way around. I still feel that way and will continue to do everything I can to do so.

I came to the board with the goals of improving our roads, bridges, and other vital infrastructure. La Crosse County ranks near the bottom of the list of counties in the state on spending per capita on infrastructure, we need to put a higher priority on fixing our roads and bridges.

Supporting and improving public safety: La Crosse County wants to create a policing oversight committee that oversee all law enforcement agencies in the county. I support each municipality overseeing their own police departments; it is not the role of the county to do that.

Protecting our natural resources: La Crosse County has a history of groundwater and surface water challenges which we need to address to ensure we all have clean safe drinking water in ways that make sense.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

We were given a unique one-time opportunity to invest in our county and communities with these funds. It is important that we recognize that these funds are given to us by the taxpayers and not a gift from the government. These funds should benefit the county as a whole and not be concentrated within a single municipality. We need to ensure that the projects we use these funds on do not create a draw on our budget after the projects are completed. We have some urgent needs within our county’s infrastructure that need to be addressed before the costs go even higher. We easily could spend all $22 million on fixing our roads and bridges. Using these funds in this manner, doing the upkeep and repairs we have been neglecting, would free up other monies within our budget to reduce our need to continually borrow money which ads to our already high debt. La Crosse County ranks as one of the highest in the state for debt per capita. We need to change that. We need to remember that it is our obligation and duty as county supervisors to ensure the tax monies we collect are spent in ways that benefit all of us in the county without adding more tax burden to our bottom line.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

The best way we can create better and more collaboration between county and all municipalities is to include representation from all municipalities including their policy makers on various task forces and committees. Currently the county board executive committee, which is chosen by the county board chair, is heavily represented by one municipality. We need a more balanced approach of representation when it comes to the leadership roles within county government. When we look at the demographics of La Crosse County, over more than half of the residents live outside the city. When looking at creating policy which affects all parts of the county, it is important that all parts of demographics of the county are represented. We need to be careful to not load committees up with like minded individuals as that leads to poor policy and poor decisions being made. I will push to ensure that every voice is heard and every voice has the opportunity to serve.

Kristie Tweed

Age: 54

Education: Paralegal degree from Western Wisconsin Technical College

Occupation: Marketing & business consultant

Political experience: This is my first time running for office.

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

I first and foremost want to give back to my community. I’ve lived in my district for almost 20 years and in the county for 26 years. I’m proud to have raised my family here. I felt a need for common sense representation in my district.

There are many areas I am interested in working on including keeping our communities safe and healthy, expanding broadband to rural areas and the appropriate spending of ARPA funds.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

I believe all the projects are extremely important and I want to make sure that the funds are allocated properly to address these issues throughout the county.

Like many of my neighbors who live in more rural parts of La Crosse County, I understand the need for improving broadband. Working from home and having two teenagers that did remote learning throughout COVID, this has really hit home for me. As I’ve knocked on doors throughout my campaign, I also hear this frequently from my friends and neighbors.

Political experience: 3 years West Salem Village Board, 2 years as La Crosse County Supervisor

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

A second term would allow me to continue to give back to my community that has done so much for me. I am concerned about how the funds from the American Rescue Plan are being used and wish to have input on this issue.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

The hospitality industry, tourism and environmental projects were also adversely effected and have not been considered for funding. I would like to change this in the second round of disbursement of funds.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

The municipalities and out-lying areas of the county struggle to provide enough first responder and law enforcement coverage. Continued collaboration is needed to accomplish this.

Political experience: Candidate for State Superintendent of Public Instruction in 2021

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

I first came to La Crosse County in 1985 to begin a career in public education which included 12 years as a school superintendent. My experiences in public education afforded me the opportunity to work with numerous elected school board members and to interact with municipal and county agencies on a regular basis. I believe it is time for me to apply these skills and experiences to “give something back” in service to our community.

My primary goal if elected is to model good governance through consensus, collaboration, and service. I see the need to foster a unified vision for countywide excellence, a collective approach to addressing our issues, and a commitment to serving others. It is simply my turn to do my part to ensure that La Crosse County remains a great place to live, work, learn, and visit.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

In my time managing the budget for a public school district, I came to believe that dollars received outside of the normal revenue stream is best applied to non-recurring costs such as infrastructure, facilities, and program development. Upon review of the board-approved allocations, it appears the board followed a similar pattern. The infrastructure investments in storm water mitigation and solar energy along with a facility upgrade at the Hillview will allow more flexibility in future budgets. The investments in program development are designed to address glaring social and economic issues such as childcare, homelessness, skilled trades, and housing redevelopment. Developing unique programming for these quality-of-life issues listed requires dollars not available in annual budgets.

As far as identifying a “most important,” I offer the human investments in solving the childcare crisis and developing additional skilled workers, along with the infrastructure investments in solar energy and storm water mitigation would rank at the top for me. I believe these items are critical steps to keep La Crosse County a great place to live, work, learn and visit.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

This is an area of emphasis in my campaign. Building consensus and enlisting a collaborative approach toward common goals was a strength of my work as a school district superintendent. I firmly believe the complex issues of water quality, workforce development, transportation and social services are best addressed through a collective lens. This means issues like water pollution on French Island, homelessness in the city of La Crosse, or poor road conditions in the town of Hamilton belong to all of us. It also means we are best when we leverage our municipal resources through a collective approach in the areas of transportation, police, fire and public works. We will always be stronger and better together than we are apart.

The quality of life in La Crosse County, and in the entire Coulee Region, is simply spectacular. We are so lucky to live here. Protecting and enhancing this precious place for future generations depends upon our ability to work in service to each other today.",t2_55479v0b,THOTness_monster,0,1647695497.0,0,t1_i19ywtj,i19ywtj,True,THOTness_monster,t3_th5cce,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/th5cce/where_can_i_find_information_on_the_local/,Where can I find information on the local candidates running for office?

Political experience: La Crosse County Board 2000-present, candidate for State assembly 2002-2004.

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

District 21 has changed through redistricting and I feel I understand the issues in the added municipality of the town of Holland, since I live in the town of Onalaska which has similar issues. Through my position on the Local Emergency Planning Committee, I have kept current on the PFAS problem in French Island, which is part of the district. I have been an active, committed supervisor and candidate, having visited over 800 doors in District 21. I want to make sure the American Rescue Plan Act funds make a lasting impact on some of our most pressing problems, especially in the area of child care. Mental health and addiction continue as a major issue. Also important is continuing the downward trend of county property taxes. La Crosse County spends 33% of its tax levy on Courts and public safety. We continue to develop a fair, impartial justice system which works to keep violent offenders off the streets while providing treatment and rehabilitation to assist offenders to become productive citizens.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

As a former teacher, families and children are important to me. I volunteered on the childcare task force because I feel it has a great impact on growing our workforce. The program would help families access affordable, safe childcare. The county ARPA funding plan provides housing for our growing senior population and skilled trades training for youth, both important for families. Both improving child care and training youth in skilled trades would help in our labor shortage.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

Part of the ARPA funding is dedicated to work with cities, villages and towns in La Crosse County on stormwater issues. We must continue to work together to make sure our water is clean, a concern for many municipalities. We can continue to pool our resources for infrastructure improvement. Our childcare initiative asks community partners to work with the county on this important issue. This is especially true in some of our more rural communities where childcare is scarce. The county economic development department continues to work with municipalities on grants and to help with locating businesses and finding revenue. This was especially true during the pandemic. We can work with municipalities to continue to make La Crosse County a safe place to live and work.

Occupation: Retired — Asst. Chief of Police La Crosse, Wis.

Political experience: Current La Crosse School Board member

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

Public service is a calling for my family. I have lived in La Crosse County my entire life and served the public as a police officer for 31 years. Now that I am retired, I have the opportunity to serve in a new capacity. I believe the people of District 21 should have a choice, which they haven’t had for most of the past 21 years. It is time for a change in representation in D21. Government accountability and transparency is something that I feel all voters want. There is too much political malarkey taking place in La Crosse County, which frustrates taxpayers and needs to stop. The bedrock of a vibrant county is public safety. Criminal accountability is lacking in our county because of policies set by the county board. That is something that needs to change and I would like to help bring that change. For D21, addressing the water quality issues in Campbell and the filling of sediment and weeds in Lake Onalaska has reduced the recreational quality of the lake and needs to be addressed. Ensuring the wise and frugal use of tax dollars should be a priority for all elected officials.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

The direction the County Board has taken with the ARPA funds and the survey conducted didn’t give taxpayers the option on how to spend these funds on anything other than social issues. ARPA funds should be used to support the businesses that suffered under COVID, not create new social programs that will have a never-ending drain on taxpayers. I believe these funds should also be used on long-term infrastructure projects to help save tax dollars in the future. For example, the county public safety radio system is long overdue for replacement. County roads and bridges need replacement. These are things that will have to be replaced in the future and would be a good use of these funds versus adding those costs to tax bills down the road. I do support ARPA funds to help expand child care availability, as that has become a major hurdle for families and for skilled trades training.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

The county and municipalities should collaborate to reduce the tax burden and eliminate redundancy. It’s time to explore cost sharing water and sewer, public utilities such as highway and street departments and IT infrastructures and platforms to reduce duplication of services and save tax dollars for those who rely on us to be good stewards of tax dollars. The county should not dictate how municipalities operate, especially on policing. The existing county leadership’s mission to assume oversight over municipal police departments oversteps authority and is unsupported by most taxpayers.",t2_55479v0b,THOTness_monster,0,1647695268.0,0,t1_i19yicl,i19yicl,True,THOTness_monster,t3_th5cce,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/th5cce/where_can_i_find_information_on_the_local/,Where can I find information on the local candidates running for office?

Jordan Briskey

Age: 20

Education: Currently at Western Technical College

Occupation: Store associate at Blain’s Farm and Fleet

Political experience: I am new to politics, but I have been serving our community for the last six years. I have been working to build a memorial for our Wisconsin Vietnam Veterans at Veterans Freedom Park. I started the project at age 15, and now the fruition of my hard work has come full circle at the age of 20. In those years I had help from family, veterans, and most importantly the community in raising the funds so that a memorial could be built. We are now in the final stages of completing this memorial. Granite has arrived and the names of the Wisconsin killed in action will soon be etched onto stones. The dedication ceremony is set for June.

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

While working on the memorial I have found my purpose in life is to serve my community. Now I am on my next project to run for the La Crosse County Board for the 20th District. The United STates was founded by young people, and those young people in 1776 made the greatest country on earth. And now in 2022 I am running to bring new, young and fresh ideas to La Crosse County. In our local government many members on the county board fail to acknowledge the problems that are non-partisan or political, for example finally fixing our roads, supporting our local law enforcement and making sure people have access to clean water. A quote from a poet Mattie JT Stepanek says “Unity is strength ... when there is teamwork and collaboration wonderful things can be achieved.” And I believe with new, young and fresh eyes on the La Crosse County Board, we can make La Crosse County prosper.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

The water on French ISland has been contaminated by PFAS. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Department of Health Services has issued a drinking water advisory indefinitely and continues to make bottled water available to as many as 4,300 residents on French Island. There will be a referendum on the ballot on the April 5 election. It will ask: “shall the state of Wisconsin establish a right to clean water to protect human health, the environment, and the diverse cultural and natural heritage of Wisconsin?” It cost the county $5,000 to put this question on the ballot. The county should work with the city of La Crosse to solve this problem. After all, the city owns the airport and they are responsible for fixing this problem. Because the county is receiving this huge amount of money it should be possible to increase spending on roads. There are about 99 miles of broken road across the county. We need to increase spending on roads.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

I think that the collaboration between the county and municipalities is very important. Together we can solve these challenges facing our local communities. For example solving the problem of clean drinking water on French Island, expanding high speed broadband projects to rural areas in the county, and lastly provide safe and driveable roadways across the county. These are some good examples of the need for collaboration between the county and municipalities. Because if La Crosse County is successful then Wisconsin is successful, and if Wisconsin is successful then America is successful.

Occupation: Lawyer, state representative

Political experience: La Crosse County Board member 1986-present (chair, 2002-11); Wisconsin state representative 2011-present (caucus vice chair, 2017-2020).

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

My main priority in elective office has always been to “work together to do better.” When I was County Board Chair, I promoted collaboration among our local governments to create the Household Hazardous Materials Program. I worked with the county, the village of West Salem and the private sector to create the West Salem Business Park. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished, but there is more to be done in the areas of economic development, transportation, tourism and public safety. Our law enforcement agencies already work well together, but the county can provide more resources to promote interagency cooperation. Finally, homelessness has a countrywide economic impact. I have been working with our local elected officials to arrive at a comprehensive solution to a complex problem. Everyone agrees that housing people in a local park is not a long-term solution.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

Lack of affordable child care is a crisis. During the pandemic, our area went from 400 certified child care providers to under 100. Young families have difficulty finding good child care providers, and if they can, the cost is often prohibitive. I recently talked with a couple that was faced with a $1,000 per month child care cost. At that rate, they decided that it made more sense for a parent to stay home. As a result, our local businesses had one less employee available to work. In the restaurant industry, this has led to cutbacks in hours, reductions in the number of days open and, in some cases, business closure. In the healthcare industry, the lack of employees has meant mandatory overtime resulting in employee burnout and workers leaving the field. La Crosse County is in a perfect position to work with our local businesses and nonprofits to take a collaborative approach to creating and maintaining more child care options. Our economy literally depends upon finding a solution so we can get people back to work.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

Collaboration starts with conversation. I think the county should return to a practice I started when I was County Board chair. We held an annual Collaboration Conference. It gave our local officials a chance to share ideas, ask for help, and simply meet and get to know one another. I think this blueprint could be expanded to include members of our local business and nonprofit communities as well. As we near the end of the pandemic, this is a perfect time to introduce and reintroduce ourselves to the other people who are making the Coulee Region a great place to live. Some of the county ARPA funds might also be used for grants as an incentive to encourage greater collaboration among our local governments. Sometimes a modest financial incentive or challenge is enough to stimulate ideas for new ways to solve old problems.",t2_55479v0b,THOTness_monster,0,1647695000.0,0,t1_i19y198,i19y198,True,THOTness_monster,t3_th5cce,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/th5cce/where_can_i_find_information_on_the_local/,Where can I find information on the local candidates running for office?

Political experience: Incumbent County Board supervisor (served one term thus far)

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

I love serving my whole community in this way. While I represent a small slice of the city, I get to see how decisions and funding can affect the entire county, and consider the needs of the whole in developing goals. I am particularly excited by the opportunity provided by the ARPA funding to do something outside the norm to address structural challenges for our neighbors. Having the room to allocate funding to areas like childcare initiatives, affordable housing, sustainability, and infrastructure for our facilities that serve the aging is so refreshing and I have been thrilled to help set those priorities with my colleagues on the board.

I’d like to be a part of seeing them realized in practical ways that impact our community needs.

I’m also very interested in finding ways to create safer, more connected communities that don’t rely on overburdening our police. I currently serve on the Judiciary and Law Committee and believe in the power of community social work, mental health support, drug treatment and crisis intervention in addressing the root causes of issues.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

Oh, this is tricky. I felt good about the process and the categorization overall, so none of the initiatives are unimportant. But I think as a parent, the issues surrounding child care and affordable housing speak to me the most. I talk with other families regularly about how challenging it is to find a safe, affordable home — whether renting or buying, and that can have a domino effect on other family stressors. We also know childcare is at a crisis point in our country — locally as a youth services librarian I have seen centers closing, and how overburdened those that remain are. And while I am hopeful that federal programming answers this need, ultimately I want to do whatever we can to help those with young children now. Early literacy and play based education is hugely important and can predict so much about later success and happiness, and our childcare workers are severely underpaid and disrespected as a profession. Meanwhile, families struggle to afford the childcare that our society requires if single parents or both parents must work. I definitely believe this is one issue that will have long, lasting ripples for our county.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

I would love to see the collaboration around housing for unsheltered people continue to grow and develop. We have so many people in our municipalities and at the county level who care deeply about ensuring everyone has safe and stable housing, and experts on the ground offering assistance as well. I think this is an area for growth in collaboration and I would support that with the allocation of funding moving forward.

Additionally, I believe the police study committee that has been formed offers a way for our policing institutions to work together to continuously improve and receive feedback from citizens across the county. Hearing from a diverse group can help all of us in public service increase our learning and reflection. Every officer I have talked with wants to serve their community and better their relationships with the people they serve. The study committee offers an opportunity to do just that.

Chris Woodard

Age: 36

Education: Some college

Occupation: IT customer service retail analyst at Kwik Trip

Political experience: La Crosse City Council member, District 9

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

My desire to serve on the La Crosse County Board stems from my interest in helping create and foster a strong business environment that will attract new economic development which will in turn lead to job creation, expansion of our tax base, higher demand for goods and services produced by local businesses, and assist in the ongoing efforts to align the supply and demand of workforce labor. In addition, my interest in serving others and making a positive difference in people’s lives is learned behavior that is part of the culture of caring that exists at Kwik Trip, where I am employed as an IT Customer Service Retail Analyst.

Furthermore, I am interested in being a member of the La Crosse County Board to ensure that we continue to provide the residents and businesses of La Crosse County with great schools, a strong and skilled workforce, safe neighborhoods, well maintained roads, bridges, parks, and exceptional entertainment venues and activities that will attract and promote tourism which will generate a significant return on taxpayer’s investments.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

Affordable housing.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

This is a big part of why I’m running— we need more collaboration between the county and municipalities. One example I can give is the need for a higher level of collaboration between the city of La Crosse and county when working with our unsheltered population, this has been placed on the shoulders of the city of La Crosse. While we may think this is something that only happens in La Crosse, this is a regional issue. We need an all hands on deck approach with the county, city and stakeholders at the table contributing equally.",t2_55479v0b,THOTness_monster,0,1647694803.0,0,t1_i19xopy,i19xopy,True,THOTness_monster,t3_th5cce,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/th5cce/where_can_i_find_information_on_the_local/,Where can I find information on the local candidates running for office?

Occupation: Retired from City Brewery. Currently working part time at City Brewery

Political experience: Current County Board Supervisor-District 2

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

Being a lifelong resident of La Crosse County I enjoy working on issues that improve the quality of life for the residents of La Crosse County. I would like to see more neighborhood revitalization along with more collaboration between communities.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

We have many challenges facing La Crosse County such as the pandemic, homelessness, roads, nursing homes, floodplain, and the list continues to grow. The county board is using the ARPA funding to address multiple needs and allocate the resources in the fairest and best manner possible.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

La Crosse County has been working on regionalization and collaboration by having representation on the MTU, La Crosse Center Board, and the La Crosse Regional Airport along with some funding for those organizations. When similar services and being provided by La Crosse County and other municipalities we should explore if this can be done in a better and/or more cost effective manner. We should have open and honest dialogue about these opportunities, and not be parochial in our decision making.

Age: 48

Education: BS Public Administration, UW-La Crosse

Occupation: Youth Coordinator with the Ho-Chunk Nation and Consultant for Racial Justice, Ho-Chunk/Native History and Culture information

Political experience: None

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

I feel that my perspective coming in as a person of color will help bring a different perspective for what the experiences are as a La Crosse area resident. My experiences as a nearly lifelong resident, young, single mom and poor to working class allows me to see La Crosse’s potential and its shortcomings. La Crosse is my home, and always will be, so if I can bring my voice to the table to help make things better, I should do so. My hope is to see where improvements can be made to make La Crosse an equitable, accessible and safe place to live. This can be done in so many different ways and I look forward to working with people to come up with solutions to bring this to fruition.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

While I truly believe they are all worthy areas, I believe the housing crisis is the greatest priority. To have individuals and families without a home is unacceptable as a developed nation. To find people choosing this situation is so rare and as a community, no one should be turning a blind eye to those who can use support and the help possible with well-funded resources. Being able to help those who are struggling due to employment issues, previous rental histories, mental health issues and any other obstacles is not only helpful to them, but an overall healthy goal for the greater community.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

I definitely hope to be able to work collaboratively with the municipalities of La Crosse County. I believe there is so much potential in working together on projects and relationships that can be mutually beneficial. It is important for each town, village or city to have its own recognition and identity, but just as in a family where there are children, parents, aunts, uncles, etc., our communities working together can make us all stronger.",t2_55479v0b,THOTness_monster,0,1647631003.0,0,t1_i16vdni,i16vdni,True,THOTness_monster,t3_th5cce,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/th5cce/where_can_i_find_information_on_the_local/,Where can I find information on the local candidates running for office?

Joe Konradt

Age: 65

Education: MBA, BA Economics & Political Science, Graduate School of Banking

Occupation: Retired after 34 years in banking

Political experience: Candidate for Mayor Of La Crosse in 2021

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

With 34 years of banking experience I have the financial, business and leadership experience to help make sound decisions for our county. Our county spends tens of millions of dollars every year, borrows large amounts of money, employs many people, and is responsible for improving the lives of our citizens. We need leaders with the practical experience to help manage a complex organization that provides vital services to our community.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

There are many, many worthwhile projects that need support. I have two concerns about the current plan. First, a portion of this once in a lifetime opportunity needs to be allocated to reducing the ever increasing burden of fixing our roads. Our spending — and borrowing — for road repair keeps growing and yet we are not keeping up with the deterioration. Borrowed money must be paid back. If we miss this opportunity to allocate some ARPA dollars to roads it means that future taxes will have to go up and up to pay the bill.

Everyone in La Crosse pays these increasing taxes — whether you own or rent. If you own, you have seen your property tax bill grow. If you rent, your landlord has no choice but to pass those higher taxes on to you with higher rent.

My second concern is that we should not spend one time funds for programs that require ongoing payments after the money is used up. Where will future dollars come from to keep these programs running? One-time funds should not be used for initiatives that indebts our future. Ignoring the future cost is not good for the people of La Crosse, no matter how well intentioned.

ARPA funds give us the opportunity to address multiple needs. Let’s make sure the allocations are appropriate and that they are directed to maximize the benefit to our community. Both the boring, like fixing the roads, and the more exciting like addressing social responsibility.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

My County Board District is the same as my City of La Crosse Aldermanic district. County decisions have direct effect on city taxpayers. As a representative of both, I appeal to all residents of our county to fairly treat others. Even though some past city officials refused to work with the county, our roles are entwined.

Why is the La Crosse Airport the only one in the entire state that is owned by a city? Every other airport in Wisconsin is owned by a county. People throughout our county use the airport and benefit from the increased business it brings. Is it fair that only the city residents are responsible to pay for it? PFAS is a federal issue that the FAA has caused by requiring specific fire fighting foam. That issue will have to be addressed, and once that problem is behind us, it is only fair that the whole county share responsibility for the airport

The La Crosse Center is another example. The center is budgeted to at best cover day-to-day operating expenses — not to pay the mortgage on the expansion. Again why are only city taxpayers responsible for this debt? Don’t residents throughout the county use the center? Don’t businesses outside the city benefit from the inflow of tourist dollars? It is only fair that responsibility be at the county level as it is in other parts of the state.

What about homelessness. Just because the city has areas where this problem is visible, don’t all of us have a responsibility to take care of our fellow citizens that need help? Wisconsin is divided into counties, every square mile of Wisconsin is in a county. Homelessness needs to be addressed at a county level. It should not be forced upon only a fraction of our county taxpayers that happen to live in the city. We all need to pay our fair share.

Pelli Lee

Age: 30

Education: Masters in Leadership and Management

Occupation: HR/Recruitment

Political experience: La Crosse School Board

**Why do you want to serve on the La Crosse County Board and what is something you’d want to accomplish if elected?**

My name is Pelli Lee and I have a beautiful partner named Joua Moua. We have 3 wonderful children (5, 1, 2 months) together and our oldest attends Northwoods Elementary. I want to represent District 1 because it is the district I was raised in. I am Hmong, and I want to bring a culturally specific lens and perspective currently not represented on the county board. La Crosse County is beautiful because of the diversity of people, and if elected I want to make sure we are building a community that represents all of us.

**La Crosse County has received nearly $22 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The current board has already divided the funds into categories, but what do you think is the most important project this unprecedented funding should be spent on?**

It is hard to list what is most important because all the projects are in dire need of support. They are all equally important, but the one that comes to mind first is improving our housing for the unsheltered families, housing for adults with high needs, and expanding on affordable housing. Hmong people have always taken care of their vulnerable populations first; similarly, the issues surrounding housing is a large part of our vulnerable populations in the county, and if they are taken care of everyone can thrive as a community.

**What ideas do you have on improving the collaboration and regionalization between the county and municipalities?**

Many projects and investments are in the city of La Crosse, and it is great for our community. I believe there should also be an effort to locate and duplicate programs that are working well in our city into other places in the county. For example, the city of La Crosse has neighborhood revitalization grants and monies that has been instrumental in prioritizing our cities needs in affordable and quality housing. The neighborhood revitalization programs puts people first and increases our tax base. This kind of program can be a collaboration and replicated throughout our county.",t2_55479v0b,THOTness_monster,0,1647630937.0,0,t1_i16v816,i16v816,True,THOTness_monster,t3_th5cce,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/th5cce/where_can_i_find_information_on_the_local/,Where can I find information on the local candidates running for office?

"Having been in a similar situation, the best option I've found is to just find a May lease and accept that I'm blowing money on an apartment I'm not living in. 

It's cheaper than an extended stay or AirBNB, storage costs, and the need to rent a truck twice.

Otherwise, talk to your landlord and see if it's possible for you to pay a pro-rated amount for the remainder of May. They maybe open to it, if anything because it means they can delay cleaning and all that sort of thing for a couple of weeks. 

You *might* be able to find a private landlord that may be willing to be flexible with you, but it's a gamble. At best, I've had private landlords let me pay a pro-rated amount for days prior to my lease starting, and then just let me run on the 1st like a lease typically does, but it's been pretty rare.

">  But like in politics the little person can do nothing about it

Ah, see but they can.  And I've seen it happen.  A good case of when it does happen, is when there are sexual abuse allegations towards a church leader - the community rallies and gets the organization to remove the offender.

The same with hate speech and bigotry from a pulpit.  And if one person is the only one who recognizes it and wishes to do something while the entire rest of the congregation goes along?  *They can leave*.

The analogy you are trying to make is very different and national borders are in effect keeping a captive audience as well as ignoring that Putin is a dictator who seized and retains power through cheating and lying.

Outwardly identifying - as in going out of your way to express - as a Christian these days *has become tantamount to spreading hate*, and this is due to how prevalent bigotry remains in mainstream Christian church organizations.

They don't have to be the Westboro Baptist Church to be spreading hate.  They can just be changing training materials at a medium sized Catholic school in western Wisconsin.  And that itself is why this problem is so widepread, and why *now* the self-identity is toxic.

You can claim it back by leaving churches, *en masse*.

"""You can't be intolerant of the intolerant! That's intolerance!""

This is the argument you are making, which is a semantic paradox readily dismantled with any halfway decent understanding of ethics, or by Karl Popper (though I do prefer Rawls' tendency to pursue exclusion of intolerance through application of social justice).

The American Christian has had many, many, practically unlimited chances, to castigate and remove the racist, bigoted, exclusionary elements from their respective organizations.  Far too many churches and religious organizations (such as Aquinas, a large school and church in the La Crosse area, and St John's the Lesser, and Coulee Christian Academy, and I'm certain a WELS church or two...) retreat into their ""beliefs"" shell and continue to practice hate and intolerance.

I'll remind you that ""No True Scotsman"" is also a fallacy.  The church organizations have a duty to remove the bad actors, and failure to do so is tacit endorsement of their dogma.

Given these two clear, related, and rationally based positions - which are also further evidenced *by the very fucking article we're commenting on* - one can make a valid and sound argument that the failings to recognize these bigoted approaches and instead *embrace and institutionalize them*, that yes, across multiple denominations, Christians have earned these badges by failing to roundly denounce and remove the bad actors.  Your springing to defense despite having shown prior convictions opposed to hate gospel, is evidence that the whitewashing and excusing away as ""not real Christians"", works.

They identify themselves as Christians.  They attend Christian churches, they adorn themselves with the symbols, tithe, send their kids to schooling in the environment, and each week presumably read from a Christian text.  What they do with the same gospels you have read, *is still part of Christianity*.

I have a few devout persons in my family.  One sits - reluctantly - on an Elder council for their denomination, another helped start a service-based, community non-denom church...which ultimately dissolved and they identify as a Christian without a church.  Both have taken every opportunity to criticize and demand change to actions within their church (and broader faith, to the latter), and work to enact those changes.  The former is resigning because the church is not headed in what they feel is the right direction, and they are using the next national council events to highlight these problems before resigning.

These days, anyone not practicing the European, non-evangelical style of their faith (it's personal and not really public except on worship days and then only really in that one place), is part of the same mechanisms that continue to spread hate and bigotry.  To call it out as such, **is not bigotry**, its practicing the solution to that paradox of tolerance...you kick out the intolerant, because they are only seeking to destroy.",t2_coow4,MuricanDeathTriangle,0,1647362200.0,0,t1_i0rnefi,i0rnefi,False,Rondoman78,t3_teftj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/teftj1/aquinas_staff_undergoes_antilgbtq_education/,"Aquinas staff undergoes ""Anti-LGBTQ+"" education through diocese",/r/lacrossewi/comments/teftj1/aquinas_staff_undergoes_antilgbtq_education/i0rnefi/,9,r/lacrossewi,0,9

That's what makes me wonder as well is the lack of drownings pre-1996 and post 2006. (Even though there was one  [Recently](https://www.news8000.com/body-recovered-from-black-river-in-la-crosse/) ) If these were truly accidental drownings one would expect some drownings in the same 10 year period prior to 1996.  Also that Eau Claire and other cities with UW Colleges didn't have near the drownings in a similar time frame also adds credibility to the serial killer idea.,t2_6flcm1db,55affensnow,0,1646090297.0,0,t1_hyucgxi,hyucgxi,False,dundeegimpgirl,t3_ahh2ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/ahh2ut/smiley_face_killer/,Smiley Face Killer,/r/lacrossewi/comments/ahh2ut/smiley_face_killer/hyucgxi/,1,r/lacrossewi,0,1

"COPYPASTA FROM OP:

Submission Statement:

  
tl;dr: PFAS are permanent, profligate and bioaccumulating. And given the health implications, this could precipitate a major Public Health crisis or two.

  
Supplemental Reading...

  
From Cleveland.com: It’s literally raining PFAS around the Great Lakes, say researchers (2021 JUN)

https://www.cleveland.com/news/2021/06/its-literally-raining-pfas-around-the-great-lakes-say-researchers.html

  
“It’s everywhere,” Spaniola said. “I’m not happy to say that. It’s not good news. But it underscores how ubiquitous these chemicals are. They are everywhere.”

  
From The Hill: Officials underestimating 'forever chemicals' lurking in US food: scientists (2021 DEC)

https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/585436-officials-underestimating-forever-chemicals-lurking-in-us

  
In addition to a lack of data on PFAS in U.S. food supplies, there are limitations to current analytical methods. Sunderland said that officials, therefore, “are systematically underestimating exposures to these compounds,” according to her testimony.

  
From The Guardian: PFAS ‘forever chemicals’ constantly cycle through ground, air and water, study finds (2021 DEC)

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/17/pfas-forever-chemicals-constantly-cycle-through-ground-air-and-water-study-finds

  
PFAS \[...\] are also linked to cancer, kidney disease, birth defects, decreased immunity, liver problems and a range of other serious diseases.

  
The study highlights the chemicals’ mobility once they’re released into the environment: PFAS don’t naturally break down, so they continuously move through the ground, water and air and their longevity in the environment has led them to be dubbed “forever chemicals”. They have been detected in all corners of the globe, from penguin eggs in Antarctica to polar bears in the Arctic.

"Yeah, criminal charges aren't going to happen, but a civil suit seems probable.  Assuming they can find out who made it, which is a big ""if.""

If that happens, they might have a case in civil court.  The Supreme Court's ruling in the Hustler v Falwell case decided that satire is protected from damage claims if a reasonable person wouldn't think it's real.

Would a court decide that the satire is obvious in this case?  The content is hyperbolic, so maybe.  On the other hand, I'd think putting the flyers anonymously on people's cars seems to imply that the author meant the flyers to be taken as legitimate; political satire is obvious in part because it's published in places known for satire.",t2_6d470,Josh1billion,0,1645294896.0,0,t1_hxlt6c9,hxlt6c9,False,Josh1billion,t3_svv5jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/svv5jc/holmen_school_board_candidates_demanding_criminal/,Holmen School Board candidates demanding criminal investigation after /r/lacrossewi post,/r/lacrossewi/comments/svv5jc/holmen_school_board_candidates_demanding_criminal/hxlt6c9/,2,r/lacrossewi,0,2

I have many hopes for the future, but one is that kids being taught/brought up in the more social-emotional learning and development environments seem to be much more inclined to shut down bullying.  This bodes well for policing, because the fewer bullies who grow up to be cops, the better.

We'll always need police, I'm not naive enough to think there won't always be a criminal element in society, but we desperately need reform to counter the generational effect of what policing has become in the US.

There should be open access to information about what led to the end of employment at a job candidate’s previous agency.”

She noted that the law does not impose consequences for agencies that fail to comply.

“I see this law as a first step in preventing “wandering officers” from finding employment after termination, not the final step,” she said.

"One job that will work with a very limited/weekend schedule until summer, but then increase to near full time in summer will really limit your options. You're looking at maybe just retail, food service, grocery stores, etc.

A few different options that aren't necessarily a ton of fun, but would be something to keep in mind:

- Cleaning services. I have a family member that works management for one and they're always looking for people. It doesn't pay amazing, but it's a pretty cushy job.  Basically you just go around offices after work hours and on weekends and clean. That means you get to work alone if that's your jam and just listen to podcasts or something while you work. Since they need people, they're always willing to work with schedules to basically any availability.

- Building security. My best friend worked after hours building security as her second job for years. They basically pay you to chill out at the front desk and take a walk around the building every hour or so. She got a lot of reading and homework done through college while getting paid pretty decent.

- Some jobs (like UPS) aren't that fun, but they offer help paying for school. I've had friends work those jobs and go to tech school almost completely paid.

- If you're planning to have an office-style job in the future, might be worth looking into part time office gigs. Sometimes there are weekend receptionist or customer service jobs open. Check job boards or city/county boards. They would be super basic, but could give you a leg up in a future job search simply knowing how an office runs.

- If you wait a month or so, some garden centers and landscaping places will start hiring seasonal workers. They usually pay decent, especially if you're willing to do some manual labor as a landscaper. And you'd get to be outside working with your hands, if that's a thing you like to do.

- WisCorps usually does a summer program. I think it's paid through a stipend. But would be an interesting alternative.

- The airport is always hiring for ground people. It's a weird schedule and doesn't pay super well, but you'd only work a few hours at a time loading planes and get free flights if you ever want to take a trip. Definitely not for everyone, but wanted to mention it as I have friends who have worked there for years and enjoy it.

- The city and county hire seasonal workers to manage parks, city services, buildings, etc. over summer. Those jobs will probably not be posted until later spring, but it's worth keeping an eye on.",t2_2j8ij182,LagerthaChristie,0,1644948123.0,0,t1_hx2actt,hx2actt,True,OutlandishnessLegal1,t3_ssrmg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/ssrmg7/parttime_jobs/,Part-Time Jobs,/r/lacrossewi/comments/ssrmg7/parttime_jobs/hx2actt/,2,r/lacrossewi,0,2

"“You begin to change their habitat and such, that they begin to eat (at Riverside Park), Carlyon said. “They don’t eat natural foods that are out there. You can alter their migration patterns.”

Riverside Park already has signs posted to discourage visitors from feeding bread to the ducks.

New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation points out the negatives to feeding waterfowl, stating that “artificial feeding is actually harmful to waterfowl.”

Artificial feeding of waterfowl can cause:

Poor nutrition

Increased hybridization

Water pollution

Delayed migration

Concentrations at unnatural sites

Overcrowding

Spread of disease

Costly management efforts

Unnatural behavior

Cumulative effects

Devaluation of the species

Most of my friends back from Chicago are musicians, work in radio, are sound engineers, and so on...So, so many hours rolling around neighborhoods getting stoned and listening to everything... one of the guys who was probably the most talented guitarist of the bunch, is a [noise artist](https://reidkarris.bandcamp.com/) now.

With that, you need some Sonic Youth in your life. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n6yPblk5zk

And Sleepytime Gorilla Museum.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9rWY6JZgGU

If you want to flirt with some 90's metal, the NY scene was stop-start-stop style encompassed by Helmet, Page Hamilton really had the genre sound nailed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUpKz5glM4k

And while I'm on trip-hop, Portishead needs to be on your list too.  ""[Scorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBx6BUTqvQ0)"" is a literal b-side of one of their hits, ""Glory Box"", and here's another more rock-heavy remix https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS3LO-pqU98

The Jesus & Mary Chain gets a gloss over all too often - the Reid brothers had some legendary fucking shows.

JAMC paired up with Mazzy Star on tour at one point, and Hope Sandoval left MS leader and guitarist David Roback for one of the Reids.

[Hope's voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r31DFrFs5A) is unreal, it's not of this earth - but combined with the languid western psychedelic guitar Roback laid down they were an amazing listen all around.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp5kF_X2PVQ

A guitarist who is unfamiliar with J Mascis and Dinosaur Jr, does themselves a disservice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yXFIWCNELY

You're also missing Jeff Buckley who was also amazingly talented guitarist, singer and songwriter.  Even threw a little bridge from The Smiths into the middle of covering Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"", but I'm more partial to ""[Dream Brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fs9hRUTOnU)"" and ""[Eternal Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzgbIaBP9cU)"" 

And speaking of guitarists who left us too early, Sparklehorse is Mark Linkous.  Collabs with so many artists, and solo opened for Radiohead during The Bends tour - where an OD left him a paraplegic for a while, and a long slow recovery.  Shunned major label pressures, and tried to forge it alone, an indie among indies.  Linkous sabotaged his recording of ""[Happy Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIOeErcqW5E)"" to keep it from radio replay hell, and here's a full set of his live. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4G-3t2pwDk  Album recordings of Piano Fire and Comfort Me feature PJ Harvey.

Oh yeah. PJ Harvey.  Dude. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvMMEX_7Dlw

And Stereolab is unreal.  Softly heard they're lounge and upbeat hold music...but turn them up LOUD. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MQOrXRCQBg and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoImolTXIgU

Love the indies, so Conner Oberst, or Bright Eyes, might be an interest.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tslUNDvrgGw

Second, it really sucks that we live in a first world country and one quick visit can be hundreds to thousands in bills to the point where people neglect their health. 

Now that I have that out of the way, look at your insurance closely. You generally pay 100% until your deductible is met then a percentage until your out of pocket max.

Nurses have been severely overworked, have to deal with terrible management, and take patient abuse daily. It easier to travel and get better (and well deserved) pay.

"This is not accurate. The snow rule is just for when alternate side parking starts. Once it starts, it's running until March 15th whether or not we get snow.

"I'm not sure anywhere in this area could be considered unsafe just there are neighborhoods that are not as nice or have cheaper homes.  Main thing with La crosse is its a big college town & some neighborhoods are like 90% students so it can get quite rowdy at times with young drunk people either partying in their yards or walking home from downtown. Basically between Main st & La crosse st is where most of them are so would generally avoid those areas if that sounds like something you'd rather not live next to.  There are definitely parts between main st & la crosse that are nice though just gets rowdy sometimes. Downtown of course is the other area that gets rowdy & might want to avoid if you have a kid. Elliot arms is just block or two from that area & is right on a main road going into downtown, pretty old building but has decent view from up top. You kind of pay a small premium to be in that college or downtown area too. Can usually find higher quality apartments for same price on the northside or in onalaska/holmen & its generally more quiet & less full of college kids in those parts. 

if you could qualify for income restricted apartments i'd recommend checking out garden terrace apartments on the northside those definitely look nice new building still & are in a more chill area with some nice parks & gardens nearby. those are under $1k a month if you make less than $35k a year , not sure what the market rate would be otherwise.

Great river residence at 400 s court st Onalaska looks like another great new building in a nice location that is not crazy expensive last i checked. 

Some of the bigger apartment management companies in the area to check for general listings are 3 amigos property management, three sixty real estate, maybe reliant real estate they have a handful of good properties.

"Other than the ones who have paid $0, is there something I'm missing here that indicates that these are actually *overdue* and not simply people who've chosen to pay in the quarterly installments that the city offers?

Looking at the top one, for example: $4,886 paid of a $20,262 balance would be just under 25%, which is in line with the city's installment plan: a bit under 25% for the first payment, and a bit over 25% for the remaining three (not sure on the exact %s).

"I do think we would benefit from a more nuanced discussion of masking children:

https://www.npr.org/2022/01/28/1075842341/growing-calls-to-take-masks-off-children-in-school

At this point it seems like we have enough evidence to say that masking pre/elementary school students is a bad idea.  I'd go further and say no masks in middle school either.

But being remote seems worse than being present but masked.  Vaccination rates among 5-11 are quite low.

Could not masking children lead to an outbreak among teachers sending students home?  I don't know.

Of course, I also feel like a vaccine mandate would go a long way towards solving these problems but it seems clear we're never going to let that happen.",t2_auw60,Lordvaughn92,1,1643664129.0,0,t1_hv1ovft,hv1ovft,False,Alexander-369,t3_sh9s34,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/sh9s34/where_can_i_find_more_information_about_the/,Where can I find more information about the people on the 2022 Spring Primary Ballot?,/r/lacrossewi/comments/sh9s34/where_can_i_find_more_information_about_the/hv1ovft/,2,r/lacrossewi,0,2

"My notes: (edited to include contributions found in Wisconsin Democracy Campaign's contributors database.)

Lamothe: retired teacher, pro-cops in schools, ""these darn kids these days don't know how to read"" and anti-masker language. *No contributions found.*

Jimenez: Local education, education is important, education education, pro-science. *Contributed small amounts to Democratic candidates.*

Berkedal: ""Enlightened Centrism is the way"", is how she comes across, nothing to go on other than a postcard sharing ticket with Garcia and Jimenez. 
*No contributions found*

Comeau: All about the Benjamins, cost concerns over SRO with no mention of the effects on students.  Probably thinks Ron Swanson isn't a satire character.  *No donations directly, but a local relative donated frequently to GOP candidates.*

Garcia: moderate democrat down the ticket, balanced responses and probably can be reasoned with in both directions.  *Local relative and also UWL employee donates to Democratic candidates, nothing directly.*

Williams: The token kid, nothing substantive other than ""I went to school during COVID"".  Best of luck in your future College Republicans leadership, because that's where these token kids end up.  *No contributions found.*

Krejchik: Anti-CRT, cop boner, Q-level anti-masker language. Would get caught in a scandal blowing Abrahams. *No contributions found*

Stein: Libertarian turd trying not to look like a Republican and thinks people are dumb enough to fall for it.  *No contributions found*.",t2_coow4,MuricanDeathTriangle,0,1643660306.0,0,t1_hv1epnz,hv1epnz,False,Alexander-369,t3_sh9s34,https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/sh9s34/where_can_i_find_more_information_about_the/,Where can I find more information about the people on the 2022 Spring Primary Ballot?,/r/lacrossewi/comments/sh9s34/where_can_i_find_more_information_about_the/hv1epnz/,30,r/lacrossewi,0,30
