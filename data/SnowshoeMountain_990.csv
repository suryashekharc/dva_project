"I'm sorry and that just stinks. This is a big risk you take with going to Snowshoe early or late season and it always makes me nervous but I have had much better luck with Spring than early season skiing. One day of rain may not be bad. We usually try to stay in the village so the kids can swim or we can shop, eat out etc for one day in case the weather is bad but one day is about it for non-skiing if there is rain.  During Christmas week of 2015 (or 2016?)  and the ski slopes were not even open until the day we left January 2nd. The homeowner was nice enough to give us 50% off and we just brought our bikes and rode the Greenbrier River Trail. We only have a five hour drive though. I had to cancel the year before last about 3 weeks before my trip because I am a nurse and my employer denied all PTO requests, even ones that were already approved like mine, due to covid for 3 months. It ended up costing me a lot of money. The cancelation policy and the loss of the ridiculous pass is exactly why I was skiing out west this year after visiting Snowshoe at least once a year and usually more for the last 30 years.  I was able to cancel my reservation up until the day before if I needed to, used my credit card miles for airfare, so the cost difference was not that much and it was worth the peace of mind knowing I would have snow and could cancel if I needed to.",t2_5fcqssxt,roadsideemphemera,0,1646244860.0,0,t1_hz2ugmr,hz2ugmr,True,mekatoka,t3_t4n44w,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/t4n44w/upcoming_trip_next_weekend_35_36_37_looking_like/,"Upcoming trip next weekend - 3/5, 3/6, 3/7 - looking like a bust",/r/snowshoemountain/comments/t4n44w/upcoming_trip_next_weekend_35_36_37_looking_like/hz2ugmr/,1,r/snowshoemountain,0,1

"Tuque’s & Old Spruce Brewery are fun “night life” spots. They’re not right in the village but a short shuttle ride away.

Try to plan for reservations in advance if you’re going to dinner at least one night (Foxfire, Appalachian Kitchen have the most variety in their menus).

Cheat Mtn Pizza & Junction are right in the village and across from each other - would still suggest calling a couple days in advance for reservation so you’re not waiting for 3 hours.

No take out options usually, at least not when I was there this past weekend.

Wildcat Provisions is a small grocery store on the mountain, ParMar store at the bottom of the mountain. Both have everything you would need for a dinner generally, but there is a Walmart on your way in about 1-1.5 hrs away.

"You should still have a good time.  It is supposed to cool off Friday night, so I would make sure my edges are sharp.  I would wager the makers will get to work until things warm up (they have been doing an amazing job this season).  Looks like a little snow Sun-Mon if you can ride the extra day.

"If you're on the beginner side of things, the green trails on the far-right side of the front side of the mountain (Logslide, Whistlepunk, Powder Monkey) are actually really nice trails. (Truth be told, they're even fun trails for those not-so-beginner!) These trails have the advantage of being accessible/served by the Powder Monkey and Powderridge lifts, which tend not to get as crowded (ie, lift lines) as Ballhooter. (You'll likely have to park at Top of the World, then take the Flume trail (Upper, Mid, and Lower Flume) to get over to the Powder Monkey and/or Powderridge lifts/trails.) There are some fun blues accessible from the Powder Monkey lift, too, if you're feeling more adventurous. Reasonable lunch can be had at the bottom of the Ballhooter lift (The Boathouse), just get there before 11 or after 2. (there is indoor and outdoor seating) There are restrooms there, too. (There is also a pizza place at the top of the Powder Monkey lift - you have to walk up to the road crossing - just a minute walk), but you better be hungry - they don't often seem to have individual slices available. Outdoor seating there. Restroom there, too, and usually less of a line than at The Boathouse.) At the end of the day, you'll have to take the Ballhooter lift back up to catch the Hootenany trail back to the Soaring Eagle lift (which will return you to Top of the World parking area), or catch the shuttle bus (aka, 'COVID Express' - if you take the shuttle, wear a mask - not many others will be doing so!) Oh, and despite other advice, if you're beginner'ish, I'd avoid the Ballhooter trail - it's steep and generally hardpack-bordering-on-ice on the upper part. Hope you have a great time - Snowshoe generally does a pretty good job of grooming things and making the trails pretty nice skiing/riding!",t2_ai5wgxp,tinker311,0,1645245150.0,0,t1_hxjhem7,hxjhem7,True,SuburbanGlop,t3_svpcmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/svpcmh/heading_to_snowshoe_for_the_first_time_monday_any/,"Heading to snowshoe for the first time Monday, any tips/advice?",/r/snowshoemountain/comments/svpcmh/heading_to_snowshoe_for_the_first_time_monday_any/hxjhem7/,4,r/snowshoemountain,0,4

"219 from Lewisburg to Marlinton is faster, but there are some pretty tight turns and pretty steep grades (droop mountain). 

92->39 from Lewisburg (well white sulphur springs) to Marlinton is in the valley the entire way. Much straighter and less turns, no steep mountains. Slightly longer. Also, You can also go the final bit through cass instead of Marlinton, doesn’t make a difference. 

I go both, not a big difference. if you have people in the back seat take the smoother route.

"Also with how easy it is to drive or bus between the areas, it won't be a big deal where you stay.

I've stayed at Silver Creek and really liked the condos I've rented there. If you like to night ski I find Sliver Creek the most convenient since that's where the night skiing is at.

My only gripe with Silver Creek is sometimes the elevator can be crowded on a busy weekend, but since you're staying during a weekday you're not going to have a problem at all. 

If no ski amenities are important, a village location would probably be better. Since the non-ski amenities exist mostly at the village.

I don't know what your budget is but for inside the village look at: Allegheny Springs, Shay's Landing, Powder Monkey, Stemwinder, Expedition Station, Highland House, Rimfire Lodge, Seneca, or Mountain Lodge. These are all at the village or super close. Google for snowshoe village map and you can see where all the lodging is.

Each building kind of caters to a different budget. The more expensive ones are definitely the newer buildings and they have really fancy amenities. The cheaper locations tend to be a little bit further from the village or tend to be the older buildings.

I've stayed in a lot of different places at Snowshoe and you pretty much get what you pay for. So if you want super fancy room next to super fancy amenities, you can splurge for the higher price room. For me and my wife we don't really care and we've tried everything. Since we mostly just ski, we tend to just get the cheapest stuff but every once in awhile we splurge on a nice place just to have a super convenient location or have super nice amenities.",t2_bs3tg,Deckma,0,1643825218.0,0,t1_hvb0yv6,hvb0yv6,False,ecupirates14,t3_shwwb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/shwwb7/mid_week_trip_info_needed/,Mid week trip info needed,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/shwwb7/mid_week_trip_info_needed/hvb0yv6/,1,r/snowshoemountain,0,1

However, I know you *can* buy a ""Silver Creek only"" ticket for significantly cheaper. One issue I've come across with that is that there is no way to actually purchase those tickets online unless the ""full access"" passes are sold out for the day. IIRC, a Silver Creek ticket is about $89 for an adult. I'd guess somewhere in the $70 range for a 9 year old.

I feel like unless it's morning or snowing then Lower Cupp is almost always icy. It's at such a steep grade by early-to-mid afternoon it's mostly been skied over by everyone and turns to ice.

"Late March is when Snowshoe's conditions are pretty well on their way to springtime. January and February are peak season, and it's pretty unlikely that the weather will devolve at that time.

I will say, though, that if your plan is to drive from Ohio on a day trip and then drive back, you should seriously consider getting a place to stay. Even if it's somewhere ""on the way"" like Elkins or Marlinton, it's money well-spent. I live along the Ohio river on the WV side, and it's a solid 4-hour drive to Snowshoe when the weather is good and the roads are clear. In a snowstorm, that same trip can take anywhere from 5-7 hours, depending on the time of day and the overall conditions of the road.

As for lodging at Snowshoe, especially if it's just you and your girlfriend, I highly recommend Mountaincrest and Ridgewood. They have small, studio condos that are just a 4-5 minute walk (in ski boots; 2-3 in normal boots) from the top of the Powderridge lift. They're pretty reasonable for top-of-the-mountain lodging as far as nightly rates go since they're not in the village. You'll thank yourself at the end of the day for booking one if you do.",t2_9psrs,ncurry18,0,1643127803.0,0,t1_hu63t6r,hu63t6r,True,leomagoto,t3_s7hk8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/s7hk8y/coming_to_snowshoe_february_26th/,Coming to snowshoe February 26th,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/s7hk8y/coming_to_snowshoe_february_26th/hu63t6r/,1,r/snowshoemountain,0,1

"Hello Fellow Washingtonian! 

My wife and I just got back from snowboarding there all weekend. Conditions were pretty good to great. Yesterday we got a ton of snow and got some real thick powder runs in.

During peak days/weekends (holidays) you’ll need to get lift tickets in advance for sure. They sell out quick. I’d recommend a season pass if you plan to go more than 3-4 days a year. This year they introduced Ikon’s Snowshoe pass which was $400 for the whole year. Not great, but better than daily rates for sure.

As you know, it’s the ice coast so conditions are hit or miss. They have great snowmaking capabilities so you’ll find that statistically, they have the thickest base and most terrain open in the area by far. Of course, a week of warmth and rain can wipe it away, but they also consistently get natural snow. We got dumped on this weekend. 

Western Territory is where you’ll go to be challenged. Their blacks and double blacks are pretty serious. I’m not an avid blacks rider but it’s certainly fast and steep. 

Overall, I don’t think you’ll be totally disappointed. People around here (DC) say that snowshoe is by far the best in the area before looking to go north like VT. If you set your expectations too high, you’ll for sure be bummed, but it is honestly a fun place to go. Good variety, the village is fun, a good brewery, and just a beautiful part of WV.

Hope it helps! Feel free to DM me with any other questions.",t2_xel9c,Dfizzle2,0,1642458841.0,0,t1_ht3jdns,ht3jdns,True,HelpfulCarnage,t3_s6fz5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/s6fz5u/first_time_adviceinfo/,First Time Advice/Info,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/s6fz5u/first_time_adviceinfo/ht3jdns/,2,r/snowshoemountain,0,2
"I also grew up in New England (western MA) and moved down here because jobs. If you are used to skiing Killington then you will probably be disappointed. Snowshoe is the best mountain we have in the mid-Atlantic hands down. Whitetail is in a lower league (I would go to Timberline before I go to Whitetail). Only advantage Whitetail has is driving time. Snowshoe is always a 4 hour drive for me (coming from Manassas). Be prepared to have 0 cell service. The conditions are best in January and February but be prepared for crowds on the weekends. At this time of the year they have actual snow and it’s not just a thin line of man made snow surrounded by grass (although it probably looked like that just 3 or 4 weeks ago). I avoid Ballhooter like the plague between the hours of 11am-3pm. If you are an expert snowboarder head to the Western Territory. It’s only like two trails but Cupp run gives you like 1000 vertical. Most of the other trails at Snowshoe cap out at 500-600 vertical. Conditions are actually pretty good for the mid-Atlantic I think. Always have to keep that in mind how far down south we are, but Snowshoe happens to just be located in the most perfect spot for a ski area in the mid-Atlantic. Silver Creek is where you can go night skiing and when they have the flying eagle lift open I will sometimes head there during the day since nobody is over there and get a bunch of laps in. There are glades there but they probably won’t be very good and will only be open if they have a lot of natural snow. 

Not sure about buying tickets. I purchased an ikon pass this year so I didn’t have to worry about all that. They have been capping ticket sales this year because of COVID. Snowshoe is definitely expensive though they cater to the apres ski type of people so there are plenty of places to eat or drink. They even just opened a ski up bar this year along one of their trails. 

I think that’s mainly all I have to say. I will also be heading there Friday and Saturday. They just got dumped on with snow so I expect conditions to be the best they’ve been all season",t2_4qzhe,nick898,0,1642458634.0,0,t1_ht3ivbk,ht3ivbk,True,HelpfulCarnage,t3_s6fz5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/s6fz5u/first_time_adviceinfo/,First Time Advice/Info,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/s6fz5u/first_time_adviceinfo/ht3ivbk/,5,r/snowshoemountain,0,5

Check availability at Expedition Station. It’s inside the main Village, very short walk to shops and the main restaurants, near multiple lifts, and it’s in the same building as the rental shop.

"Depends what your budget is. I personally recommend getting a room in the Village. You’ll be closest to all the main restaurants and bars and you can easily walk or drive to others. My wife and I have stayed at Highland House twice now and like it. It’s ski in and ski out and you get a locker to store your skis/board in on the first floor.  Never stayed anywhere else within the Village but I assume it’s similar.

If you want to stay on or very near the mountain cheaply then find a room at Silver Creek or possibly the Inn at Snowshoe. The Inn is at the bottom of the mountain so bear that in mind. Everything at Snowshoe is at the top of the mountain. Snowshoe is unique in that you drive to the top of the mountain and park then ski down. Silver Creek is separate from the main mountain. It’s like 3 miles away from the Village so it’s not far but you’re still separated from the main mountain. There is one restaurant/bar at Silver Creek and a brewery just a mile down the road. Silver Creek is the only place with night skiing so that’s the only nice thing about staying there is instead of waiting for the (free) shuttle to take you back to the Village you just leave Silver Creek and walk to your room. The main mountain closes at 4:30 

If you want even cheaper lodging then there is the Super 8 in Elkins (50 mile drive) and family owned inns at Marlinton WV (20 mile drive and the check in times can be quite strict)

It has been a tough winter (climate change blows for us skiers and snowboarders) but it will almost certainly be better than whatever the hell Appalachian Ski Mountain is. Snowshoe is the best place you can find in the mid-Atlantic hands down. 

The conditions could still be icy who knows what the weather will be, but you are choosing a great time to go. January and February are the two coldest months of the year so they have all this month and a good chunk of next month to open new terrain and hopefully get some natural snow. 

Hope you have a good time happy to answer any more questions you have I’ve been to Snowshoe more times than I can count at this point",t2_4qzhe,nick898,0,1641613056.0,0,t1_hrqenpc,hrqenpc,True,AmericanInfidel01,t3_ryompb,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/ryompb/valentines_skiing_trip/,Valentines Skiing Trip,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/ryompb/valentines_skiing_trip/hrqenpc/,4,r/snowshoemountain,0,4

"Hi! Depending on if the year is good (so far it has not been the best, but we just got tons of snow) it will probably still be good on Feb 11th! So yes, it will probably be better than Appalachian Ski Mountain! There are two places I know of to stay, one can sometimes be pretty cheap, and I have no idea about the other.. So anyways top of the world (the first building you see coming in from the front side of the mountain) can be pretty cheap to rent! Like rent for a day or two, though. There is also a newly built hotel right across the street from western territory! If you want to go out to eat, just go to the village, there is bars (fox fire and and something with the word spruce in it), a pizza place called cheat mountain pizza, a good sit down restaurant called the junction, a Mexican restaurant and even a Starbucks! If the conditions are really snowy while you are driving up, I suggest taking the backside of the mountain, the front side is a lot steeper! If you are learning to ski, I recommend going to another part of the mountain called Silver Creek. It is owned by snowshoe, and it should be easy to find. It's a lot less steep over there, and is great for learning! To rent equipment, you can go to a place called the ski barn near silver creek. (I forgot to mention there is a brewery near silver creek as well). You can also go to a business in soaring eagle (right across the street from top of the world) they rent and sell skis and equipment for skiing down there!

"So here's the one big issue with Snowshoe. . .the ratio of butts to bar stools is way out of whack. In the village itself, your best chance at getting into a bar is The Junction, by far the largest bar. Newly remodeled, they have decent food and a good craft beer selection with a full bar. Tuque's would be second, not right in the village but a short walk. Great apres-ski vibe there. As for the rest of the village spots. . .Old Spruce Draft House and Old Spruce Tavern have the best beers, brewed right at Snowshoe. But the draft house seats like 8 people and only serves beer. The taverns seats maybe 10 and has food and liquor. Foxfire has a nice bar, but again, very small and difficult to get into. Surprisingly, the bar at Cheat Mountain Pizza is pretty good. The atmosphere is kinda meh, you're in a pizza place, but it's large and has a good view of the village. The Mexican place (Sunset Cantina) has a tiny, awkward bar in the back, last time I was in there it smelled like mold. Would not recommend.

You could always shuttle up to Top O' The World and hit Hoots, it's old-school and a lot of the workers hang out there after their shifts. Grungy but a good time!

"I run alot at snowshoe and I refuse to use treadmills, so no help there.

Here is my secret- go to top of the world, then go towards ""the sanctuary"". There is a gravel road that follows the ridge, the ""cheat mountain ridge trail"" that goes on for at least 3 miles (goes further but I haven't been). Since it stays on the ridge it is minimal hills and the gravel is decently smooth/good footing. Be careful, they do the UTV tours out there though, but that does keep it clear of snow. 

Also, you can drive the 15 minutes down to Cass and run on the greenbrier river trails. Crushed gravel, smooth, flat, goes on forever. I don't believe they plow it though.

Rain can be pretty bad for the snow in the sense that it melts it and washes it away. So prolonged rain and warm temps are disastrous. Luckily it hasn’t been that warm, and snowshoe is very good at making snow. You will probably be ok. 

If you mean more what the snow will be like to ski on with rain, it’ll be slushy. Maybe some ice. Not my favorite conditions personally but any day on skis is better than the alternative IMO.

"Yep. It's really hard to teach someone a skill you've already perfected and have no experience teaching to others. You won't realize how many little things you're doing without consciously thinking about them that make it work. The other thing is experienced riders know how to read the terrain ahead for bumps and divots that newbies won't see, and have a sense of how in control or out of control they are becoming much earlier than an inexperienced rider.


Case in point for the last part there - I got the bug to try skiing last season one weekend after a decade of boarding, and had ample water skiing experience as well. I was over on Western by mid afternoon and was able to work my way up to that quickly because I knew how to read terrain, knew how to turn on skis by shifting weight, knew the trails, and had an instinctive sense of when I needed to slow down or when I might be about to go too fast and needed to slide down to a stop to avoid risking it. All of those things were ingrained skills I had from two other related sports which I was largely doing without having to think much about it. 

It was just reacting instinctively to what was happening. I could not easily verbalize the technical aspects of *how*, *when,* or *why* to do them to someone who did not have ample experience with them before.

"I don't think they are doing ticket limits this year, but double check it. I would be most concerned about holidays and spring break limits.

Last year they had COVID-19 limits and you could run out of tickets easy, not sure if they are doing the same this year. If it's a holiday weekend buy a few weeks in advance. If it's middle of the week I've never seen them run out of tickets. 

I've seen some folks car camp/trailer camp. It can get crazy cold and windy at the top of the mountain where Snowshoe is at, so word of warning if you try that.

As for the cheapest deals, Cass has a few rentals and you can also try the Facebook group. A few landlords will rent outside Airbnb or VRBO to save cash and pass on the savings to you. Especially if you book middle of the week or multiple trips.

Blue Bird Bargains on the official website can be a good deal for on mountain lodging. You don't pick the room, they just put you into what's left over. I've had some good deals that way and got a ski in/ski out place. The Inn at Snowshoe is cheaper, which is official, and is off mountain with a shuttle. A lot of staff are boarded at the Inn.

Just so you know, this year is crazy.

"Here is the best way to spend the least amount of time in lines all day even on weekends and get the most variability of terrain:

1. Park or Start at Top of the World. Be there for rope-drop at Soaring Eagle. You should be able to get 10 laps in from 9:00-10:10 before it gets too crowded . once you are done. Take Upper-Mid-Lower Flume all the way to Powder Monkey.
2. Once you get to the top of Powder Monkey, walk to Western Territory. It should be around 10:30 now. Lap Western for four hours. If lines are lower, and you don't waste time you should be able to get 5 laps per hour. Hit about 20 Laps, till around 2:30. Walk to the Bus and ride and head to Silver Creek.
3. It should now be around 2:45 once you are on the slopes at Silver Creek. Take Timberjack Park to Cascade. Ride Cascade up and from 3:00-4:30. You should be able to get 9 or so laps on Flying Eagle.

Should end up being a solid day depending on lift lines this should ad up to a 40,000-45,000k of descent day.

"One thing is for certain, this will kill off anyone from buying both the mountain collective and ridiculous pass. You’ll be better off just buying the Ikon Pass.

I can’t blame them, it was a ridiculously good deal. Although with Vail now owning the three closest slopes to DC, I feel like this may push more people who used to get the Ridiculous pass to the Epic Pass over the Ikon Pass. You get day trip-able skiing - no need to pay for expensive snowshoe lodging plus skiing out west- as opposed to only skiing which requires lodging - as snowshoe is too far to do as a day trip. Save some money on your out East skiing by avoiding lodging costs so you can use that for out west lodging and plane tickets.

It’s laughable they’re blaming the long lift lines on the ridiculous pass holders. I like Snowshoe, but was there two MLKs ago when they lost power one day, and then had ballhooter down the next day (I believe due to freezing rain). One of my buddies who had bought lift tickets was offered a free future lift ticket, us pass holders got no compensation- no food vouchers, no partial lodging refund, no discount off a future season pass, nothing. It really turned me off from snowshoe - not to say I won’t ever go back but no longer every year. As has been pointed out by others, if they really cared about lift lines, they’d upgrade infrastructure some. I liked the suggestion of extending grabhammer, shouldn’t cost too much.",t2_aj6jx6lr,gregarious83,0,1614097553.0,0,t1_goh3u0g,goh3u0g,True,Dfizzle2,t3_lpvvki,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/lpvvki/snowshoe_is_getting_rid_of_the_ridiculous_pass/,Snowshoe is Getting Rid of the Ridiculous Pass,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/lpvvki/snowshoe_is_getting_rid_of_the_ridiculous_pass/goh3u0g/,4,r/snowshoemountain,0,4
"Having worked in a similar corporate structure in the past (Private Equity group owns large % of individual owner-operated companies). Corporate more or less gives marching order to improve overall profit, not to focus on the profits of the individual owner-operated companies that is their responsibility. 

Snowshoe likely makes a killing on lodging, food, drinks, and single day tickets (which is their responsibility). Alterra probably sees Ikon Pass losing to a super cheap season pass (It's increasingly rare to see a season pass at an Ikon resort anymore)

Season pass holders build loyalty, but at the same time are less revenue than single day holders. At $279 if you go 3 times (118*3=$354) you have made the difference for some folks, that could be a long weekend trip, for a local thats doable with no lodging. They probably have data on the average Ridiculous pass users going somewhere in the vicinity of 4-5 times and hence making it $379 requires you to go 4 times to make it up. 

I bet in 2ish years they bump it again.

"Definitely agree on the spending! See my comment above... I have so many questions about their customer data and revenue model lol. For us the Ridiculous Pass made it stupidly easy to justify heading up there for longer trips a few times a year. While we rent thru ABNB/VRBO usually, we are also def at the bars, shops, etc. Ask me about the $220 goggles I picked up last trip after we forgot to bring mine lol. A day pass isn't going to buy a serious pair, they'll buy the $15 pair, but someone up there for a week will. I don't understand why day pass rates going up wasn't a part of this equation. If I had to guess, I'd assume those are the lowest margin customers -- one day or one short trip per season (otherwise they'd have a season pass), and feeling squeezed in the wallet by higher day rates, are less likely to spend more elsewhere (except perhaps equipment rentals). So, if you had to squeeze, wouldn't it be anyone except your SEASON PASS HOLDERS? Your most loyal demographic? I don't get it.

It *feels* like Snowshoe's rationale was something like this --  ""You Ridiculous Pass riders were getting a super deal, but a significant portion of you just come up here, ride the slopes, stand in the lines, and don't spend a dime or any significant amount of money more than a waffle or beer. That's not going to work for corporate so... we'll raise the season pass rates and that'll knock off a big chunk of those low margin Ridiculous Pass *users* because they are not profit centers."" 

The unfortunate corollary there is that a lot of those potentially low-margin season pass holders are locals/in-state -- the folks who really helped to sustain this place as customers and employees over the last 40+ years. Through that lens, it comes off like a bunch of private equity luxury resort bros from out West are ""gentrifying"" the Shoe in a purposefully exclusionary manner.",t2_42owt,tetrine,0,1614093071.0,0,t1_gogtil6,gogtil6,False,Dfizzle2,t3_lpvvki,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/lpvvki/snowshoe_is_getting_rid_of_the_ridiculous_pass/,Snowshoe is Getting Rid of the Ridiculous Pass,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/lpvvki/snowshoe_is_getting_rid_of_the_ridiculous_pass/gogtil6/,2,r/snowshoemountain,0,2
"Good points... I've been trying to think through what Alterra's motivations have been as well. I can't quite figure how the endgame  benefits Snowshoe. I'm sure it was all based on plenty of data, but why Snowshoe agreed to take this *action* based on the data they had is unclear (other than coercion lol)...

It definitely makes sense that Alterra would want to sell more Ikon passes like you said. I wonder why that is a beneficial option to Snowshoe re: revenue? I'd be curious to know how many of each pass type Snowshoe typically sees, as well as the portion of revenue Snowshoe receives on a Ridiculous Pass vs Ikon Base vs Ikon full. Is the Ikon revenue per pass divided amongst resorts a user visit based on pass scans or all Ikon resorts? I'm also curious what the resort spending is for each type of pass holder. I'm sure they've tried to aggregate all that... 

Personally, I don't see a ton of Ikon pass holders. I see more seasons and day passes. Pure anecdotal n=1 meaningless observation lol. If Snowshoe has to share Ikon revenue with all or some other Ikon resorts, what's the rationale for *Snowshoe* (as opposed to Alterra, for which the driver is clear) to want Ikon visitors versus others? Is it that sweet, sweet Primo pass revenue (which has got to be all profit) on the small percentage of the already small percentage of skiers who are riding on Ikon? 

Is it that Ikon pass holders spend orders of magnitude more money when they come to Snowshoe? Is it that, on average, Ridiculous Pass riders are low/no margin visitors?

"This is an awesome comment. All of these points are spot on and I couldn’t agree more about how  stupid it was for them to blame the ridiculous pass holders for long lines. 

I’d be curious to know what per capita spending  for us ridiculous pass holder is. I know my costs were high as shit. Having a guaranteed lift ticket made it easy in my mind to justify staying for more than one or two nights on or near the mountain plus beer, more beer, and food. Not to mention, the amount of random gear I bought at the shops because of swings in weather or because why the hell not. My point is that the with the deflated lift costs, those “losses” would have been offset by me having the freed up money to spend elsewhere. 

I get it though. I’m, thankfully, able to handle the increase and see how it brings this ticket in closer parity to the IkonPass.

The Base Pass. So, what do locals do? Buy the Ridiculous pass.

"The price going up, I can tolerate that personally (others cannot though, and that really sucks, skiing shouldn't be a posh people only sport). However I am REALLY bothered at the way they're spinning this. Blaming Ridiculous Pass as the reason for the long lift lines. Acting like they care about the long lift lines at all, Ridiculous Pass or not. C'mon Snowshoe, be fucking real with us. 

Lift lines has been long F O R E V E R. Last change to lift system was 2006. In the interim Snowshoe added IKON pass, Ridiculous Pass, countless other pass promos, more shops, more dining, a brewery, more off-season activities and events, several new real estate developments, etc. etc. The problem isn't that Snowshoe has *relatively* affordable season passes, the problem is they haven't upgraded the infrastructure to match the demand which Snowshoe has worked hard to generate!

The new season pass prices will keep some folks away, but eventually the market *will* bear the new prices (maybe even as soon as next season!). What then, geniuses? We will be RIGHT BACK HERE where we started with these long ass lift lines. And THEN what is Snowshoe going to tell us? ""Oh sorry, got to increase those pass prices another 50%?""  Please.

Why has Snowshoe been working so hard to generate increased demand but refused to do anything about the slope experience to accommodate that? More housing, more amenities, but NEVER any more slope capacity. 

There are some relatively straight forward things they could do straight away to *actually* reduce lift times:

* Expand daytime skiing hours at Snowshoe
* Expand daytime skiing hours at Silver Creek, especially weekdays
* Open and close Silver Creek on the same dates each season as Snowshoe
* Stop treating Silver Creek like an ugly stepchild and make it actually easy to get to back and forth to
* Put more buses on the roads, put dedicated/""express"" Western/Powdermonkey to Silver Creek shuttles on the road for getting folks back and forth between mountains in addition to the buses already running. You can ski your way to the rest of Snowshoe from the Powdermonkey bus stop, we just need the fastest way back and forth for people. The bus system is shit for getting to Silver Creek and back, everybody knows it.

Things they could do with some more investment:

* Add night skiing at Snowshoe
* Increase existing lift capacity
* Increase existing lift speed
* Extend Grabhammer 100 more feet to the village so it takes pressure off Ballhooter

And if we're making wish lists. Expand the terrain!!!!! I'm still waiting for this lol https://skimap.org/data/181/2200/1443544063.jpeg



**TL;DR Snowshoe, don't lie to me about the reason the Ridiculous Pass is ending. You're raising the prices to milk more money from us, just own your shit. Lift lines won't be shorter.

"Well honestly, you can't know unless you try it out. I grew up in a big city and I've never looked back. Summers here are super underrated actually. Up top it hardly hits 80 mid day. It can really be a beautiful place. People are very friendly, if they aren't drug addicts. But it is remote. There isn't great cell service ( if any at all). People all know each other so it can be be cliquey. Everything close is overpriced. The winter can be miserable. But if you really want to do it, I say go for it and maybe just get employee housing to start. More than likely it will be quiet this summer. You probably wouldn't have 2 roommates because of the lack of internationals. Could have the summer to figure out if you really want to stick around and if you do, a better idea of where to live etc. Im giving you alot more bads than good, but most good things are self explanatory.",t2_6f3e7g20,Lmdgnp,0,1613852805.0,0,t1_go5jx9f,go5jx9f,False,Clubblendi,t3_lo8tr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/lo8tr9/what_is_it_like_to_live_here_yearround/,What is it like to live here year-round?,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/lo8tr9/what_is_it_like_to_live_here_yearround/go5jx9f/,2,r/snowshoemountain,0,2

"Eh. Honestly, what's your plans on housing etc? If you live on the mountain you're looking at $350 per month to live with 2 other people. If you're trying to find a place nearby to live, its extremely difficult and nearly impossible to find under $750 a month. I have been looking for 4 months now and nothing at all. I've also worked here for 3 years so I do know some locals but no help there either. You could live in elkins, but you are looking at a 2 hour commute. Also like today, the roads could be bad. Keep in mind that the closest actual grocery store is 30-40 mins away in marlinton. And Walmart is 1 hour. Its not horrible if you really weight everything out. But tbh if you're looking for a remote experience there is a million out west that offer everything from housing to food included.

If it's snowing hard and the sun has set, driving up from the Cass side is really bad.  I have snow tries and I've even had to put on my snow cables. I've see more than my fair share of cars not make it up because they weren't prepared. If you're worried grab a pair of snow cables which fit your car and tire.

"Yes. I got IKON with Primo pass add on back in late Sept.  That entitles you to buy 4 one-day guest lift tickets at $169 which include access to the primo lift lines.  I also tried to buy the 4 passes I needed in Sept. and was told I couldn't do it over the phone or online, but to just show up at the depot and I could purchase them when I arrived.  

 In early Dec. the website started showing limited lift ticket availability (i.e, sold out for certain dates) due to COVID.  I called the depot again, and they repeated that I couldn't buy the primo lift tickets over the phone or online, but not to worry about any limitations because, ""Snowshoe takes care of their season pass holders."" 

When I got to the depot for my family's New Year's trip, the depot worker told me I couldn't buy the primo tickets (or any regular lift tickets) because they were already sold out.  I went absolutely ballistic, asked to speak to the manager and they ended up selling me the tickets after all.  I'm not sure how others were treated, but I didn't see anyone else in the primo lines except for my family the next couple of days.  

Bottom line: 100% worth the $169 per ticket to cut to the front of Ballhooter on every single run, and really the only reason I got the IKON in the first place.

"Restaurants and bars are generally open for both takeout and sit down. I never sat down inside, but it wouldn't surprise me if restaurants have capacity restrictions. Old Spruce only allowed outdoor seating, for example. They may close earlier than usual though although not sure how much compared to pre-Covid times. I think things are generally open less during the week vs. the weekend. I know for a fact Silver Creek doesn't open until noon on Mondays. I think Sat/Sun they always open at 9AM. Not sure about the rest of the week.

Shops are also open and much more restricted than restaurants/bars. They have signs posted about how many people can enter and once you enter the store you have to wait in a little roped off area before you can walk around. Sometimes lines of people waiting to enter shops stretch outdoors.

"Currently thinking the same for Thursday - Saturday. No idea what they are trying to open next. The trail report said to stay tuned for updates on terrain expansion so with that and the cold temps/snow on the way I am optimistic that western territory may be open by the end of this week or this weekend. 

Did you reserve your tickets/lodging already? I tried getting tickets, but it said some type of error occurred and it sent me a saved, but unconfirmed itinerary and I'm currently on hold with their phone reps to hopefully finalize plans.

EDIT: They are filling up fast. I just talked to a rep on the phone. I was able to get full day tickets for Thursday/Friday, but Silver Creek only for Saturday. Silver Creek is still expected to open on the 18th, but he said Western Territory is a bit more iffy because it requires a lot of snow to open up.",t2_4qzhe,nick898,0,1607961459.0,0,t1_gftku55,gftku55,True,vadersgambit,t3_kczetn,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowshoemountain/comments/kczetn/thoughts_on_when_the_mountain_will_open_more/,Thoughts on when the mountain will open more terrain?,/r/snowshoemountain/comments/kczetn/thoughts_on_when_the_mountain_will_open_more/gftku55/,2,r/snowshoemountain,0,2
Was there this weekend and it was really good.  We heard that western could be open by next weekend because all of the lift are open in the basin and usually thats when they pull the trigger on western .  Silver creek also opening this coming weekend so there is also that.  I wouldn't worry to much about the terrain though as many of there best runs aside from cupp (in my opinion) are open.
