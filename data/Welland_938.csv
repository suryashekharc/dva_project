"This area is the older part of Welland, and can have its share of social issues. These issues exist, regardless of where you are in the region. I think its a good idea to lock your car, regardless of where you are. I live on the west side of town and have had my car rifled through when I left it unlocked.  Right now, there is a resurgence of younger people moving to the older neighbourhoods, as this is some of the last remaining affordable housing in the area.   

East main has some good restaurants, and my favourite coffee in town at caffeinoline.  The rex on king st has the best pizza in town, and lucianos which is just down the road from you is up there as well. The Saturday morning Market is under rated and a lot of fun. Check out the European pantry on avenue place for cool meats and cheeses. On Saturday morning, do the market, European pantry, and caffeinoline trifecta. 

You're right by Merritt Island, which is a great walking spot. On the west side of the canal, running parallel to Merritt Island is the canal trail. It runs north to south, from lake erie to Ontario, and connects to a wider trail network called the greater niagara circle route. It's a great resource to have.  Merritt Island is great for dogs, but I prefer the west side of the canal, as there is more open grass space and typically less people. I find that it is easier to give the pooch a good run and swim there.  Both sides are great, though

Something I've noticed is that people who typically complain  about Welland never really take the time to step out and find hobbies, or put any effort into finding worth while things to do in the region. Welland is slowly bouncing back, and it's close to port colborne, fonthill, and st kitts, all of which are great for a night out, and a moderate bike ride away.

Most places aren’t even accepting new patients around here but I found that Lincol county humane society is by far the most fair priced in the areaand there staff was great also .

"Foxes are always seen on Merritt Island, specifically in the early hours. Between the Woodlawn underpass and the 406.

Coyotes are often on the other side of the canal (end of thorold rd parking), but you Will rarely get glimpses of them.  Tons of mink in the canal trails. You might even get lucky and see some bald eagles. There have been more and more appearing along the canal path.

As mentioned, deer, coyotes and coydogs in shorthills.  Heard that the coydogs were bred as hunting dogs decades ago, then kind of just reverted back to wild. Not sure how much truth there is to that, though.

Lastly, the wainfleet bog is the only place in niagara where you can find massassauga rattlesnakes. I believe an endangered species of turtle is there as well.

"First, let me just say: Welcome to Welland! 

To answer your question, it all depends on your needs. For example, my house required a certain speed that was only offered through Cogeco so we went with them.

As far as we know, we've had no issues with them or the service other than a blackout once or twice in the laat 6 months.",t2_zyolw,purplebutons,0,1620920097.0,0,t1_gxzljx9,gxzljx9,True,Muffysourcandy,t3_nbjapi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Welland/comments/nbjapi/advice_on_internet_providers/,Advice on Internet Providers,/r/Welland/comments/nbjapi/advice_on_internet_providers/gxzljx9/,2,r/Welland,0,2

"Apparently  there is a proposal to turn the old firehall on hellems  to a brewery  and a upper floor museum.  That would be an amazing start to bring new life into downtown.

If you look at all the towns ans cities  that have really turned  around  and revitalized  -picton, prince edward County,  Paris  , fergus, elora, st. Thomas,  breweries, cafes, vinyards  are the catalyst.

However  the proposal seems to be held up in council  as its a choice between  funding from taxes and grants for a full fire museum  (which in my opinion  wont do a thing  to revitalize  and bring new growth ans investment into downtown, and required non stop subsidies) ,or the hybrid brewery/museum. 

A great example  of how a decent brewery  and food scene can single handedly jump start a recovery...is yellowknife (lived there for 7 years  and just moved back to On).  Very transient city, not many food options, people came to get their foot in the door with govt jobs , and then left . Now people are staying , and choosinf to live  there. And the restaurant scene  is bustling.  Lots of young professionals  with expensdabke cash are staying there and it has generated tonnes of capital and investments. (No im not affiliated  with any of these, ive just lived and worked all over canada....and there is a pretty  constant  theme )

I hear people complain about dt east side all the time,  high crime rate,  needs investment,  and how there is no hope.  Well this is a positive where someone / a company wants to spend/  invest into downtown....and it might get turned away because  of a fire hall fire museum  (museums are great but people go once and thats it. Won't bring tourists. Or new money)

The only way to get dt back is to get people to spend money there  , so welland needs to have places people want to spend money at.. the younger millenials spend  a ton on craft beer and great food.  

Welland has a great scuba scene,  but people come,  dive and leave.  I do and did ..

Any way, ranting sorry.  I just was shocked to find out there was a potential  for a new craft brewery in welland.... in downtown... that will honour the museum idea...and yet some opposition because of plans to just convert to a single fire  museum... i couldn't believe it especially knowing how much i go to breweries and how literally every brewery i know in s.ont is a massive business generator. 

Anyway, i
Contact the municipal govt  and express interest in the brewery ..",t2_9122z2a1,Scubaddicted,0,1620764685.0,0,t1_gxrtjjh,gxrtjjh,True,Drewtendo_64,t3_n1i16b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Welland/comments/n1i16b/what_would_you_like_to_see_next_in_welland/,What would you like to see next in Welland?,/r/Welland/comments/n1i16b/what_would_you_like_to_see_next_in_welland/gxrtjjh/,3,r/Welland,0,3

Not exactly ‘tiny homes’ but I’m from out east originally and there were always affordable ‘ trailer parks’ around. Niagara seems to have few and far between where you can live year round.

"Sounds like they may have broken a municipal by-law.

If I understand it correctly, it sounds like your neighbour has changed the existing drainage patterns so that it now drains onto your property. This would be a clear violation of by-law 2017-18 for the City of Welland. 

I would recommend contacting the Engineering department at 905-735-1700 ex. 2204

Looking at other MPP's and MP's in the Niagara region they all seem to support local pretty well. It's a lot easier to support local when what you say in parliament actually is listened to. I think it's posturing by the NDP to be honest. They talk a lot of talk but know they can't do anything. When ever they do speak up they get swatted with a flyswatter. Maybe it's time Welland looks at red or blue as a way to get better representation in parliament. I think it's pretty obvious that if an area elects a candidate who is part of the winning team they get more help from the gov't.

I can see the region eventually winning out and soaking up all those positions. So to me the entire thing is just one uphill battle and it'll take a good group of people.
