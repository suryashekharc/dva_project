And I have seen folks actively collecting (I believe clams?) down in the Cummings Park Beach area. Granted I wouldn’t rely on other people’s actions when my own safety is in the mix haha but that paired with the apparent water testing leaves me more optimistic.

"Had family/friends living in all of the mentioned spots, here is there and my take.

Stamford Urby: weirdly reminds me of a black mirror episode - pretty weird location next to a highway and ancient mall. Apartment layouts are absolutely bizarre and force inconvenient minimalism.

Parc Grove- (currently live) - awful since this new management took over, nicely located though and huge apartments for cheaper than normal

Postmark- Not the best bang for your buck in harbor point, amenity fees here were 30% more than NV and Beacon in Harbor point (and sentiment about Postmark having a lot of kids is true). Apartments are beautiful though.

NV- Very interesting layout, if you value community rooms and amenities NV is really cool. The apartments are a bit weird though, but you can get a bit more space here than other harbor point options.

"Lived in 121 Towne, basically the same apartment building as 111, same owners, etc. 

Everything was fine except management being a complete pita in my experience.I was a bit singled out so I don't know how good my testimony would be. Person under me would complain about my dog barking whenever he heard a single dog bark, so they would come and knock on my door at 2AM waking me and my dogs up, then tell me that my dogs are barking because theres a strange person angrily hitting my door. When I moved out before I sublet it, I got 2 more noise complaints that week from them for my dog barking. There was literally nothing in the apartment and they called multiple times about my dog - 30 miles away - was being loud. It wasn't until I showed them that the apartment was completely empty that they stopped calling.

Obviously, they illegally kept my security deposit despite the inspection paper being perfect, and then would hang up when I called.

there was usually an open grille at any time and the pool doesn't get that crowded (my apartment overlooked them).

"I’m all about Springdale Diner, specifically for breakfast foods. I’ve had Stamford Diner, which was very good. If I want to go out of town a little, Orems is my choice all-day-everyday.

As for Bull’s Head, my opinion is that they died a long time before they closed. The food was okay but the service really went downhill. Maybe it’s just me but I don’t care how good your diner is, if your service sucks, I’m not eating there.

"+1 Stay away from Honda of Greenwich.

When we were in the market for a sedan, we thought of the Accord and when we went over to check it out we noticed they treated their sales people like absolute garbage (yelling and cursing) and that made our sales person -extremely- pushy to make a sale while low balling our trade-in by $4k and insulting pretty much every other brand we were considering (just insulting, not a pro/con).

We eventually picked a Kia Optima (from Stamford Kia), which was $5k below MSRP just by asking (tech package and brought all the way from Cape Cod because we wanted a specific color, $32k MSRP, sold for $27k) but I do have to say you should get financing from outside as they will try to fleece you with the APR.",t2_3xeun,nekoeth0,0,1647104023.0,0,t1_i0dwy7q,i0dwy7q,False,Grapeflavor_,t3_tc4yt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StamfordCT/comments/tc4yt7/dealership_recommendation/,Dealership recommendation?,/r/StamfordCT/comments/tc4yt7/dealership_recommendation/i0dwy7q/,2,r/StamfordCT,0,2

"I checked in with most of the local dealers of those brands except Kia (did check in on Hyundai) back in December / January. All that I contacted wanted $3K over MSRP for crossovers or small SUVs. I ended up paying $2k over at New Country Toyota of Westport for a vehicle that is harder to obtain (RAV4 Prime PHEV). Wasn't happy about the price but they were at least friendly and easy to deal with.

Very few of the dealers actually had the cars we wanted on the lots. People were putting down deposits before the vehicles even arrived (which I ended up doing for the Prime).

"I stopped going to SH years ago after I sat there for three hours overnight in the ER with my 11 year old brother after a car accident and no one came to see us. When I went to the desk, they were gathered in the far corner doing something. I chalked it up to taking a break and asked if someone can discharge us. One said “you sure want to leave? The doc should be coming soon.” The doctor was standing right next to them. I declined and left. The doctor then tried to charge me a fee for her “services” and the hospital swiftly took it off when I complained.

"Yup; [JA academy](http://www.jaelitesoccer.com/) has indoor games. The website is just ok, I called up and asked and they found me a spot on a week night men's league team.

[Chelsea piers](https://www.chelseapiersct.com/soccer/adult-leagues/) also has games, both league and pick up though I haven't been to pick up in years. Generally more expensive.

[This meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Stamford-CT-Pick-up-Soccer-Meetup-Group/events/284135853) group was active during the summer despite not looking like it on the site, might be worth reaching out to the owner and seeing if they are still playing.

In Norwalk, the [SONO Field](https://www.sonofieldhouse.com/) house had men's league as well.

"So honest opinion, no one comes to Stamford for fun, you get people for work. If you can get a condo near some offices you'll probably do ok but expect business travelers only, and you're competing with big and kind of cheap hotels, and limited to 3-4 nights a week on average tops. I think the math for an Airbnb investment is questionable here. (250k for a 1br anyone would actually pick over a hotel room if the company is paying for it anyway, and maybe you can get 600-700 a week from the limited nights, one week is going to taxes every month, 3 weeks are going to mortgage, another week is going to expenses, maybe more, and most months only have 4 weeks). Also a large chunk of buildings ban short term rentals or charge fees for it. (Heard of a place foreclosing on someone for short term renting and couldn't find the owner easily, it was a thing, 500 $ fine per violation).

We used to go to wagmore but our pooch would always come home smelling awful. We would have to bathe him after each visit. We ultimately switched to Spot On. They have a great outdoor area also and they have a live feed so you can watch them play. They keep the play areas very clean and our dog never smells. It’s also a vet so we know he’s in good hands.

"1. If the server is considered eligible for tips, their base pay plummets to a little over $6/hr for restaurant workers. The difference between that and min wage has to be made up by either tips or their employer, but only up to min wage.

2. Some restaurants do actually funnel some amount of tips to other staff, called “tipping out”.

3. If the person you’re picking up the food is also the one that cooked/prepared, they are in fact receiving that tip (many fast/casual joints).

4. Even if the tip is just going to the server, they did spend time getting your order ready, handing it off to you curbside, etc. that takes away from tipping customers inside, so tipping them is fair to do.

Chain restaurants (Chilis, Applebees, etc) exist, but they are far less common.  However,  there's way more locally owned/smaller local chain restaurants (such as Barcelona).

The overall bar/restaurant scene is pretty great in both Stamford and surrounding areas, it's a very high cost of living area so a lot of people with cash to burn eating out.  1 bedroom apartments are probably going to be in the $1,700 - $2,200/month range.

"Stamford’s a great city and I love living here. That said, I think you should go for it. Sounds like you’ve got a really solid group in the city, which means you’re already over one of the biggest hurdles - meeting people, especially during Covid. So you’ve got a safety net. As someone else mentioned, plenty of green space in the city especially in the outer Burroughs but also Manhattan. And the truth is, very few people move to NYC for the first time later in life. Sure it happens, but more commonly people end up wanting more space or things as they get older, have a family, etc. Now is the time to do it, even just for a year. I moved there when I was around your age with similar fears and expecting to bail after one year - I stayed nearly a decade and have fond memories of my time there. I know I will never move back and I’m so glad I did it when I did despite it being scary.

"Hey man, I lived in NYC for 15 years (Different parts of Queens) and just moved out during the pandemic.

If you're young it's great - but super expensive - my first weekend living in the city I went drinking in Manhattan - one $200 tab later and I decided I'd drink more locally haha.

The parks are your greenspaces, restaurants are your kitchen, etc.

Where are you thinking of moving? Are you thinking of keeping your car?

Unless you have a great well paying job, or in a relationship with 2 incomes, saving is fucking hard...if that doesn't concern you, give it a try until it grinds you down.

Personally I left because I was tired of killing myself for so little - but I lived there from the time I was 25-40, so...

On the other side of things, truthfully: sometimes it takes just as long to drive from Queens to NYC as it does to get from Stamford to NYC...For me, Stamford is a way better quality of life. The city had lost it's magic for me by the end, and in the last few years every time I drove back in from visiting relatives or going on tour (I'm also a musician), I dreaded it...

Now that I don't live there anymore, the magic is back...but again, the thought of living in New York doesn't consider the cost and the pain in the ass stuff...

"Welcome!

Mianus river trail is nice in Bedford and Greenwich

The Empire State Bike trail is in Nearby Westchester county and is beautiful for a long bike ride,

The Appalachian trail briefly runs through CT, the sections in Putnam County NY are nice and can be rugged.

New England is out your back door, great skiing, hiking, Mountain ranges. There is a nearby spot in Massachusettes you can see 6 mountain ranges (Catskills, Adirondacks, Taconics, Berkshires, Green, and White Mountains)

Montreal is about 5-6 hours away, just before that are the Adirondacks and Lake Placid.

Stamford has Amtrak service to Boston and DC.

50 minutes away is NYC, the Cultural Capital of the world.

Tanglewood in Mass has the summer home of the Boston Symphony, Caramoor is a 20 -minute drive that has a great SUmmer Music and Opera (bel canto) festival.

I have found it easier to drive down the west side of Manhattan, park in the 60s, and Lincoln Center and Broadway is an easy walk.

Fantastic beaches on Long Island, NY

The Bronx is nearby, The Zoo and NY Botanical Gardens are great. Arthur Avenue for great Italian food and Culture.

NYC can be pleasant, even on the hottest days, the city cools off at night, unlike Austin.

There are plenty of nature preserves and parks in the next towns over (Greenwich, New Canaan and Darien in CT; Bedford, Armonk, and Pound Ridge in NY). And plenty more within an hour’s drive.
