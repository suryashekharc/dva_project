One of my best finds (and probably pretty rare) was a Citgo on 460 near Zuni that has a fridge full of Faygo. Red Pop, Creme Soda, Cotton Candy, etc, was great. I'm pretty sure I paid over $1.50 for a bottle so pretty expensive but worth it.

"I would not recommend this attorney. This Lawyer doesn't have a clue how to communicate with his clients, he's very vague on any details when representing in ""so called your best interest"". He negotiates behind your back and doesn't even consult with you and find out you'll get screwed and it's not in your best interest. 

When you hire an attorney, you want to feel like your attorney is on your team. Mr. Sceviour's huge ego and God complex prevents him from doing this. He hardly ever returns phone calls. When you do get the chance to talk to him, he is short and condescending. His lack of communication resulted in very vague wording.  This is an attorney that will add more stress to your life at a time when you least need it. When you call him out on his violation of Virginia State Bar Rules of General Communication, he gets defensive and will just withdrawal, which proves he will just take your $2500 and not do his job!

Chesapeake does not have any ""bad"" schools in my opinion. No one is getting stabbed, everyone is graduating. Anyone that wants to go to college is getting in.

"There is a maximum fine for speeding which is on their Va website. 6 to 8$ per mile over for each mph plus 200 to 500$ fine and court cost. This is regardless if you went to Driving defense class(50$-100$) Lawyer fees can be 300$+ for just arriving to court with you. 

Demerit Points against your license has more to do with your Insurance notification and DMV. It was 3 or 4 points out of 12 for speeding, reckless which was 6.  The points only stay on record for 5 years.In Virginia, traffic school can be completed to earn a maximum of five safe driving points only it takes 12 to loose a license. 

The fine that the judge will give you is pretty much firm and your not going to see any difference of leniency to benefit for a savings on a first time ticket and the same for insurance companies.You can always go to Driving class after court if wanted. 

 Always... go to court don't pay it through the mail and always plead Innocent, let them find you quilty. Pay the fine in court and be done with it.

"It depends on if your child has special needs or not. If your child is gifted (my first two were), the primary/intermediate/elementary schools are all great. If your child has special needs, my second two did, (I.e ADHD, autism, dyslexia, etc.) I would avoid Western Branch Primary and Intermediate. The issues I had with teachers, administration and SPED staff was infuriating and they both feel behind, especially in reading. I am not the first parent to discuss at length the issues and problems there. We sold our home and moved to South Western Branch (because the community is great) where our two youngest attended Chittum Elementary and Jolliff Middle. The difference was night and day and they caught up very quickly. Western Branch High School is fine if your child is gifted but it’s not any better than most Chesapeake schools. My youngest two have not reached high school age yet. The ratings being all over the place makes sense based on my own experiences.

Are you moving from NYC or just tristate. I just moved from Suffolk County Long Island and I would say it’s comparable if that helps out.

"CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) — Officials in Virginia have closed a road in one neighborhood after a mother bear and three cubs were spotted napping in a tree there.

Chesapeake Animal Services asked residents near the tree — on Bruin Drive — to stay inside Monday and the general public to stay away from the area. Officials hope that giving the bears “space, quiet, and time” will allow them to leave.

“Black bears can be unpredictable, especially when sows (mothers) have cubs,” animal services officials said on Facebook. “This is an extremely stressful situation for the bears, so it’s important to stay away from the area. That includes driving past the site.”

Chesapeake Police spokesman Leo Kosinski said dispatchers were first alerted to a possible bear sighting around 2 a.m. Monday, The Virginian-Pilot reported. Later that morning, officers saw the bears napping in the tree and closed off the area, he said.

Conservation officers with the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources were responding to assess the situation.

Bears are very good climbers, and these four will likely climb down and walk away when they’re ready, Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources Chief of Wildlife Gray Anderson said.

“From what I’ve been told, a momma bear and three very healthy young cubs have made their way up a tree in a residential neighborhood,” Anderson said. “Our expectation is, if we leave them alone they’ll climb down and go back to their natural habitat.”

"First people.. just so you know.. this site is a ragingly homophobic site that's masquerading as some sort of new wave ""feminism"" site. The only thing they talk about on this ""feminist"" site are the dangers of LGBTQ people, pedophilia, and zoophilia, usually in the same sentence. So maybe read this with a grain of salt. 

Secondly the message has been twisted to make it seem crazy or outright evil.  This professor doesn't want to normalize pedophilia and she's not using the term MAP to soften the image of pedophiles. She's using the term MAP because MAP and pedophiles are two different things.  Pedophiles are people who actually  acted on attraction to children. MAPs are wired to be attracted to children but do not act on it. It is a disorder that's not understood well.  In the case where someone has this attraction and actually tries to do the right thing and seek help, society treats them like they're evil. Even though they are absolutely coming out and saying that the behavior itself is wrong and they don't want to act on it.

The internet loves to get a good old rage boner whenever they hear the word pedophile, but we shouldn't ostracize and lump in the people trying to get help BEFORE they've done anything wrong.

Malware removal is more of a potentially unwanted program removal skill.  Identifying the items that should not be on a system and removing them.  It also involves cleaning all the items launching on startup that aren't needed.  Just doing a basic malware/cleanup on macOS can really improve the performance for a user.  We recommend against any malware/virus tools on a Mac.  The built in XProtect takes care of any real threats.  Most of the other issues aren't blocked by commercial programs.  We often find malware installed alongside the malware blocking programs.  Thank you for the question and let me know if I can answer anything else.

We can all find reasons to open or not open schools.  It should not be an either or option.  There are families with medical issues or senior parents living with them that should not take chances as well as a group of teachers that are at higher risk.

The 'A' and 'B' trails are up to the front, and the 'D' and 'E' trails are back a ways. It's all wooded, and, except for 'C', it's all left as natural as you can get.

"Ipswich as mentioned earlier, probably the only thing in Chesapeake.  Next closest is the trail at lake Maury in Newport News, fun trail about 5 miles long with some technical features and decently challenging climbs.  Some really fun trails up in the Williamsburg area like freedom park (about 15 miles of single cross with a few badass downhill sections), new quarter park with a 6 mile loop and some seesaws and jumps sprinkled in, and York river state park which is capable of beating down even seasoned mountain bikers, it’s super steep and technical, it’s actually impressive the level of trail they were able to carve into those hills.

"You’re very welcome! There’s definitely some amazing programs here for music (BYOV and HRCP) for older kids.(music is pretty much my whole life so I know and love to inform others about good programs that’s why I keep mentioning it lol). For young young kids and since you’re planning to move eventually, the best possible thing right now would be to live near great bridge primary. They just rebuilt it like a year or 2 ago and it’s really nice . Once your kids are elementary school age I’d suggest still staying in great bridge, because the ‘grassfield’ elementary (CRE) has mobile home thingies as classrooms. Neither of the elementary school music teachers are really any good. for middle school, great bridge middle- the music and arts programs there are great. It’s really only high school you should worry about, and that’s like 10 years away for your family haha.

"don’t have a lease idea for you, but as a highschool student who is in grassfields STEM academy in order to not go to great bridge, move somewhere in grassfield. Great bridge has a terrible orchestra program and ok band/chorus programs, has flooded before, and has human poop placed in the cafeterias at least 5 times a year. They’re also known as the school that has a weed issue. For middle/elementary school however, the great bridge schools are actually better. grassfield can be super pricy because of the highschool, but it’s worth it if you have highschool aged kids. I know this prolly doesn’t help a lot, but that’s my  expert opinion as a high schooler (also grassfield has an AMAZING orchestra program that being in for even a year will 100% change your kids lives. the director is the best teacher I’ve ever had and I look up to him so much)",t2_2ks4k2f6,papayo_potato,0,1588460779.0,0,t1_fpb2kp6,fpb2kp6,True,[deleted],t3_gca4za,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chesapeake/comments/gca4za/looking_for_a_flexible_lease/,Looking for a flexible lease,/r/Chesapeake/comments/gca4za/looking_for_a_flexible_lease/fpb2kp6/,1,r/Chesapeake,0,1

"FiOS has a new mix and match plan. I get Internet-only and provide my own router. My options were 100 for $40, 300 for $60, and Gigabit for $80. Speeds are symmetrical. You have to autopay with a debit card or checking account, and provide your own router to get those prices.

FiOS customer service is a mixed bag, sometimes great sometimes not. The actual internet is very reliable. FiOS also has no data caps.

I used to have Cox ten years ago. Their customer service generally was nice but their internet was... unreliable. According to other people I’ve talked to over the years, the only thing that has really changed is Cox started imposing data caps.
