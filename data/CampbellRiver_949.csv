"For an easy day hike to get to know the area, consider Ripple Rock trail, and the Campbell River Lookout trail, both North of town. Myra falls is another local fav, though it's a bit of a drive. (All very google-able for more info)

If you want to give the mountains a shot, drive up to Mount Washington and try some of the hikes from there. Kwai Lake and the Cruikshank Canyon lookout are my fav for a (strenuous) day hike. If you want to go a bit further out, hiking up to Bedwell Lake from the south end of Buttle is quite doable but gets crowded on weekends.

Standard lecture from your local SAR volunteer: read about the route in advance, know your skill level, tell someone where you are going and when you'll be back, be prepared for weather. Do not expect cell coverage when out in the woods, have your maps available offline (eg maps.me, caltopo, or downloaded in Google maps), and for larger hikes consider an Inreach or other sat comms device in case of emergency.",t2_8sobsdeg,Mysterious-Stock-883,0,1648147348.0,0,t1_i1yqf3v,i1yqf3v,False,[deleted],t3_tmkrjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/campbellriver/comments/tmkrjx/hello_campbell_river/,Hello Campbell River!,/r/campbellriver/comments/tmkrjx/hello_campbell_river/i1yqf3v/,1,r/campbellriver,0,1

"I moved to the island from the prairies years ago.  Campbell River is a fantastic little town if you like em relatively quiet.  We've got the amenities most people need, and we're right next to one of the best parks in the country (Strathcona)

If you start to feel like Campbell is too teeny, you can drive an hour and a bit to nanaimo for less teeny, 3 hours to Victoria for a big town that feels like a city, or hop a ferry to Vancouver. 

The other poster in here is right about the trucks, and pretty accurate about the need for a car to really have a good time around here (even if the town is small, it's like everything is located as far away from you as it can be.)

"I made the move from Ontario about a decade ago. I remember being very surprised by the sheer number of people driving large trucks here üòÜ it also took a while to get used to so many folks in town working in camps rather than locally.

There are loads of trails and other outdoor activities, but you'll find you need a car to do pretty much anything as the town is inconveniently long (in my opinion).

If you're like me, you'll get very used to seeing mountains in the distance, and miss them whenever you go back east of Alberta.

"Finland!!! i don't know anyone in Finland. plus you got homogeneity in Finland, all (or 99%) are Nordic. heterogeneity of homeless population is what you got up and down the Left coast from San Diego to Vancouver to Campbell River, bro.

&#x200B;

You have homeless who don't wanna live indoors. Sure there are also those that want to return to society, just need help with mental illness and/or addiction. In the US there are vets who cannot live in door, like physically, PTSD. those that lost jobs and just need a place to crash, sure capsule module housing like Tokyo will work. showers, mentors, then move them to work places.

&#x200B;

But are there places north of Prince Rupert you can ship them homeless who don't wanna live in society? i dunno. Yukon maybe. but once you see encampments its all over. so RCMP has to keep enforcing trespassing, loitering, nuisance laws to ensure encampments don't form.

&#x200B;

"Lol it is a *current* problem, bud.  We have to fund those studies first. There are working examples for other parts of the world, but here in Canada, and even regionally, we have to be willing to fund our own research into fixing this.

Until there are concrete working solutions we have to collaborate and try various things. 
Stuff that is gonna cost us money, and some of them might not work so we move onto the next one. 
When someone's solution has merit, we take from that and try to apply any feasible aspect we can. Some might even be counter intuitive, but we have to have an open mind about it.

Until covid is not a threat, until the housing crisis has been reduced or fixed, and until there isn't a flood of fentanyl on the streets, I don't know what the ultimate fix would be. Collaboration with other communities, and engaging with our own to work together on solutions is the first, most obvious step.

Throwing up our hands at anyone trying to discuss a solution is just honestly kinda dickish, in my opinion.

About those other examples though, no not Portland or Seattle. Conservatives always seem to think left wing people love those cities for some reason. Really legitimately just a conservative talking point, I don't even know anyone who's been to Portland.

We should, though, look to Finland, for example.

"Opioid epidemic, housing crisis, then a globally infectious disease. 

I would say those three things have been very effective at creating this situation.

People are homeless because they either became addicts and lost their jobs and/or lost their homes, and wages are lower than ever so pulling yourself out of that kind of quagmire is *very* difficult. People often turn to drugs to make sleeping on concrete less awful. Then there's people who become addicted through prescription medication. Regular folks who slipped into it without even realizing, and now are just trying to stave off withdrawals. A common thread of addiction is petty theft to sustain the habit. No one sets out to become an addict, but eventually the only thing on mind is just keeping the pain away.

I feel sympathy for these people, not resentment.

"The article noted that calls to rcmp stats were way up last year and gave no indication or any what the factors at play.  Absolutely none.  While op could have been partially or even mostly correct.  There could also be hundreds of other contributing factors.  For instance.  Domestic abuse and mental health issues skyrocketed over the course of the pandemic.  Social programs became more difficult to access.  I could go on forever about all the factors at play that may or may not contricute to these statistics.

Or i could just be an ignorant asshole whos decided to entirely blame an already marginlized group because thats what i see when im driving around and my opinion is all important and its obvisiously entirely these peoples fault.

"We spend most of our time outdoors with our 2 dogs hiking, backpacking, camping, snowboarding, etc, and we're usually up in the Comox/CR area (or north) exploring when we do those things.  That's just our playground, and the fact that we no longer have to drive far to get there will just be that much better for us.   I used to live in Comox, so it will be great coming back after 14 years.  CR is changing and continues to grow and it will be great to see what happens in the next few years.  

Our jobs have kept us in the Vic region for much longer than we had hoped.  My new job, plus the wife's fully remote work made it finally possible to leave Victoria, and we'll be purchasing a house once we figure out exactly where we want to live.  From job offer to job start is less than a month, so we secured a dog-friendly townhome rental in Comox almost immediately, and it will be great to get re-acquainted with the area again.  

As for Victoria, I don't enjoy the traffic anywhere in the CRD and downtown Victoria just isn't interesting anymore.  We used to love taking the dogs downtown on a Friday evening, grabbing some ice cream and wandering around, but it's not the same anymore (our opinions).  We realized a while ago that the Victoria area is not the paradise that everyone believes it is, and with the incredible increase in housing costs it's even less desirable as a place to live, and we make about 2.5 times the average household income in Victoria.  Maybe it will be cool to come down island and visit friends and sight-see, but who knows.  

I see you're in Edmonton.  I did my schooling at NAIT back around 1999, and the live music scene was just amazing.

"I'm not sure, to be honest - and none of my advice should be taken as coming from a ""knowledgable source""!
In the link I provided to the OP - there's comments from folks that had the water from this spring tested, and nobody mentioned any concerns.

I do know there's no mines anywhere near this mountain - and I believe forest fertilization is a thing of the past - so other than the very small possibility of a few ppm of oil or diesel (which is unlikely, considering how quickly flowing water will cleanse itself when filtering into, and out of an aquifer) there's probably not much to worry about - but everybody has a different threshold for worry.

I've traveled much of the world, in my 53 years - much in the days when bottled water wasn't as universally available - and I never had an issue with water.  The very last thing I'll worry about is the quality of spring water from a mountain north of Campbell River.  But again, we all have different thresholds!

"It's a natural spring - so by definition is a point where an aquifer exits through the surface.

I'd be very surprised if there was anything to worry about here - theres no habitation, storm drains or sewage above the spring - just rain and melt water filtered through earth into the aquifer, and exiting from the hill above at a pipe at the side of the highway.

I suppose there's always the slight risk of contamination from a dead animal, or animal scat if the aquifer does actually run above ground - but I'd guess it's a pretty small chance.  And again - that's only if it runs above ground at some point - and looking at the topo map for this spot, it's hard to imagine it does.

I fish the North Island rivers pretty frequently - and don't hesitate to drink from any of them that have flow (except the Salmon R. below the Big Tree Atlantic salmon hatchery, of course.  The amount of algae on the river bottom there, makes it obvious it might not be a great idea - but the fall Caddis hatch there can be amazing!

CR is a great place but I find it exceptionally cliquey. I know a lot of people here who have a hard time making friends, but I feel that it's the same in every other town for young adults these days. As a single guy I find it hard to live here and meet people but you may find it different.

Rentals are almost impossible to find, and if you have a kid or pets you can probably count on living in a hotel for a bit. House prices are starting to get high too.

I'm a 30 year old guy who has been here for 5 years and I'm moving to the mainland soon. I feel like I've kinda seen everything on the Island and feel trapped by the ferries. The cost of living is getting pretty high and I'm anxious about how easily the Island can be affected by extreme weather events and supply chain disruptions.

"Thanks for all of the thoughts! I appreciate it. We currently live in a small rural northern Albertan town with absolutely nothing to do in the winter when it‚Äôs -30 often.

We want to move to the Island for more mild weather and the PNW environment (ocean, forests), and we were thinking we could stretch our mortgage budget for anywhere from Nanaimo to Campbell River.

 And there is an opening at a clinic for my husband‚Äôs job in Campbell River this summer so that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre considering it! 

Like I said, we literally have no amenities where we live rn, just basic small town things like KFC and DQ üò≠ so I think anywhere we move will be a huge lifestyle upgrade.

"I'm afraid I'm no expert in fly fishing for salmon - I was a guide in the Charlotte's, thirty years ago - and figure I caught all the salmon I'm entitled to, during those years!
I figure once they reach freshwater, they should be allowed to finish thier mandate unmolested (and I'm not judging - this is a personal belief).  

I think if it's pinks/cohos - a 7 weight would suffice nicely - if it's Chinooks you're after, probably an 8 or 9 weight.

But it really comes down to leader strength - the largest Chinook I've caught was on a 7 weight rod (in the ocean and set up to mooch cut plug, rather than fly fish), and it went 55 pounds - so a 7 weight can handle some pretty good sized fish.

While we're talking about salmon in freshwater - I can't recommend the late summer/fall ""snorkel with the salmon"" in the Campbell, highly enough.  I think it's run by Destiny River Adventures, now - and it is an amazing experience.  My partner and I have done it every year since we moved here (15 years ago) - except for the last two (Covid, of course!).

"I decided to learn on my own thirty years ago - gotta say, YouTube would have helped me out immensely - ha ha!

My only advice is to get a decent set-up - you can go with a cheap reel, but don't get a cheap rod and line - good quality gear will shorten your learning curve quite a bit (it doesn't have to be expensive - just not the budget stuff). A 4 or 5 weight is perfect for the trout in this area.

Take some time before you head for water, and practice in a field - getting a feel for shooting the line will save you a ton of frustration.

As stated - River Sportsman and Tyee are both perfect places to get some advice on what, how and where.

We live in an area where there is some really great fly fishing to be had, for sure - this area has a ton of fly-only lakes and rivers that don't get a lot of pressure.

"Hello fellow denizens of Campbell River, I'm looking for a few individuals to play D&D with. For some background I am a 30 yo male, and I've been playing D&D for a little over a decade. I have my own homebrew world and I run a 5E game. 

Players of all experience levels are welcome at my table, however I would prefer to keep it 18+. I also welcome all LGBTQ+ and BIPOC players!

I prefer to play in person, but we will have to see how everything shakes out with the Omicron variant and gauge what everyone's comfort level is with that. 

If you are interested shoot me a message with a little bit about yourself and any character concept you may have in mind, though the latter isn't completely necessary until we actually start playing.

"Real estate across Canada is up, it always will be when the housing market accounts for a huge part of our economic stability,  with stock markets rising and crashing, crypto currencies disrupting traditional investing and resource economies bouncing up and down every 4 years when new governments change policies.

Real estate has replaced gold and silver as a place to put money with a reasonable safety margin, and it's been solidified consistently by governments regardless of what party with increased credit stress testing and stimulus rebate home improvement programs.

Campbell River is located just far enough from large population centers so you can benefit from daytrips to concerts, restaurants and events, and proximity to major shipping lanes without living in a congested area.

As the winters continue to become milder and the summers warmer it's naturally going to be a desirable location.

Combine all of that with better quality internet allowing remote workers with higher than average salaries than locals make, a strong focus on retirement care and an aging population selling homes worth millions in the city to buy here and the real estate prices are unlikely to come down anytime soon.",t2_cobtnegd,Trap_Line_,0,1626222835.0,0,t1_h53mqdu,h53mqdu,True,NurseAwesome84,t3_ojkh7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/campbellriver/comments/ojkh7a/real_estate_in_town_is_messed_up/,Real estate in town is messed up,/r/campbellriver/comments/ojkh7a/real_estate_in_town_is_messed_up/h53mqdu/,3,r/campbellriver,0,3

"I'm not super knowledgeable about the lumber market, but I think that softwood has normalized while panel products (like plywood) have not.

CR has fewer amenities, but lots of other things that are attracting folks (ocean, beach, trails, Mt Washington, mild climate, etc), along with having everything folks *need* to live comfortably. My theory is that places like CR are absorbing lots of people who don't need a local job (remote workers, retirees, business owners, etc).

I, myself, moved here from Alberta (where it seems like a lot of the influx is from). I work from home and my wife is a nurse just getting back into working after an extended mat leave.

The house we bought was literally right on the line of doable when we signed on it back in Nov. If we were looking now, we'd be hooped, so I totally sympathize with the affordability thing -- unfortunately that just means people with more money are buying the properties.

"Ha ha - I don't want to make it sound like zero tide is the only safe tide.  The beauty of SUPs is that you're skimming over the top of the water, so less impacted by tidal flow than the hull of a displacement vessel.  Just go slow with tidal flows, and get to know your limits safely.  

I can't say what you're place will be like for tide - if you are standing on the shore and any part of Quadra Island is directly across from you - then that's Discovery Passage - and subject to higher tidal flows than the waters to the south of you - where looking across has Cortes Island or the mainland visible many miles distant.  Those waters are the Gulf of Georgia, and because they are not squeezing through a narrow passage, move much slower.  Just like in a river - the water along the shoreline moves much slower than the water in the middle of the Passage (due to friction with the shoreline and shallows) - so staying near shore is a good plan, until you have a sense of how quickly the water is moving and your comfort level in it.  This will keep you out of the traffic lanes, as well - as Discovery Passage can be a very busy place for large vessels - as they all travel through Discovery Passage when transmitting north or south.

At Campbell River - the flood tide flows north to south, the ebb tide - the opposite.  However - that rocky island you can see in the Gulf - about five miles offshore approximately opposite the peak of Mt Washington is Mitlenatch Island  - and is approximately where the tides meet, coming around the Island - so the flood tide flows up from the south, and down from the north - and meet at that island.

No need to know that - just a point of interest - ha ha!

At the end of the day - be safe, and don't hesitate to call for help if you feel like you may need it.  There is a CG crew on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year - SAR is our primary mandate - and help rendered in a timely manner is usually far more effective than help rendered too late.  Also - there's no charge - ha ha!

"One thing to keep in mind, is that the waters of Discovery Passage (the narrow bit of water between Campbell River townsite and Quadra Island) is subject to high tidal flow, as the water ""squeezes"" through the passage.  Flows of between 3 and 5 knots are not uncommon - and flows of up to 16 knots are happening right now between Race Point and Seymour Narrows - as we phase through the ""super moon"".

There is almost no tidal flow in the River estuary (the water on the west side of Tyee Spit), and the tidal flow is much lower south of Discovery Passage proper - so south of a line between Cape Mudge lighthouse and the Van Isle shore.

Wearing a life jacket is never a bad idea - as is carrying a waterproof and floating handheld VHF radio (which are not at all expensive) so you can call for help if you ever need it (channel 83A for radio checks with Victoria Coast Guard Radio, and channel 16 for emergency calls).

For context - I've been a Lifeboatsman at the Campbell River Coast Guard Station for the last eight years (and with CG for 25 years in total) - so I tend to advocate for ""safety first"" - ha ha!

With a few precautions, SUPing around Campbell River can be a truly enjoyable experience - have fun out there - but have a plan, and consult a tide table before heading out on the water.",t2_2z3hdo0o,ddoubletapp1,0,1624802043.0,0,t1_h37mtaw,h37mtaw,True,[deleted],t3_o8ggf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/campbellriver/comments/o8ggf3/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/campbellriver/comments/o8ggf3/deleted_by_user/h37mtaw/,2,r/campbellriver,0,2

My suggestion is to contact local funeral homes explaining you're tracing your genealogy and if they could pass along your information to the next of kin, that would be appreciated.

"Campbell River and the island in general is a great place for geocaching. I lived here ten or 12 years and started geocaching and discovered hundreds of awesome places because of it.

The horse people are awesome and there is a local club if you're into horses. [https://www.facebook.com/campbellrivertrailriders/](https://www.facebook.com/campbellrivertrailriders/)

If it's the smaller 4 legged friends you're into then just like everywhere else everyone loves to talk about their furry friends. The local cat rescue org is very well supported here too. [https://www.facebook.com/CAMPBELLRIVERPAWS/](https://www.facebook.com/CAMPBELLRIVERPAWS/)

Lots of wildlife around. Watch out for the deer when you are on the roads. There are a lot of them and they are quite used to being in their urban range. Most seem to understand roads are bad. I often see them using crosswalks even. For gardeners it's a love/hate thing with them.

"we lived in CR for several years and my wife was born and raised there. It can be tough to make friends here but like others have mentioned volunteering will get you in touch with people that share your values. 

lots of outdoors stuff to do! lots of beaches and seriously if you are just there for a few months go to them all! Ocean beaches are amazing and as someone who moved here feom the interior of BC I could spend hours on an ocean beach even in rain or storms they are just so cool! 

if you have kids some of the ""playgroups"" are awesome we made some lifelong family friends going to those. 

Also should be noted just because you are in CR doesnt mean you need to stay there, the rest of the island is just a few hours away, you can get to the south end or north end of the island within 3hrs feom CR",t2_tgulkz1,stewarthh,0,1611805062.0,0,t1_gl1lqb6,gl1lqb6,True,[deleted],t3_l6gul2,https://www.reddit.com/r/campbellriver/comments/l6gul2/hi_guys_im_moving_to_campbell_river_for_this/,"Hi Guys!

"My kids are your age - I'm across the way, on Quadra. 

I'll echo much of what you've already been told; we moved from the prairies as well, and love it here.  There are plenty of outdoor activities in particular, much of the indoor stuff is harder with COVID.

One thing I might suggest is volunteering if you find a group with interests similar to yours.

"Welcome!!  You're going to love it here!

1.  Campbell River is phenomenal.  It's all about the outdoors here.
2. As for things to do, there are a ton of trails in the Beaver Lodge area.  The city has maps (see below).  It's also close to a lot of other great hiking areas, and in the summer Swimming holes, although I'd avoid those during Covid just to be safe.  Explore!!  Also, the Elk Falls Campground and suspension bridge are awesome areas to visit.
3. When you're out, make sure you are Cougar and Bear aware!  We get wildlife here.  We've had at least a dozen bear warnings in areas of town recently, an the occasional cougar comes through.  Just be wary.  I think it's a great thing to be this close to nature, but make sure you have a lid for your garbage can or you'll be cleaning up after animals.
4. Oh dear, I think you'll do fine.  I don't know if I have any advice that will help.  Enjoy.

"To get to the southern trail up Drinkwater Creek to the base of Della Falls you need to get to the far end of Great Central Lake. There were no passable roads in '93. I drove a ways up the north side of the lake before launching my canoe. According to Google Maps, I paddled more than 20 kilometres. I overnighted on the lake, then hid my canoe in the woods, locking it to a tree. Looks like the distance from the mouth of Drinkwater Creek to the base of Della Falls is 16 km. There are logging roads if you're into that kind of adventure, but with the number of gates Island Timberlands is installing, it might be more hassle than you need. I've heard of guys willing to run you out by boat, but I didn't pursue that idea.

Bring a compass, for sure, but the trailhead is obvious at the end of the lake and the trail is quite evident as you are following the creek.

"Thanks for the response! I love your story man, completely true that the best fishing is when you eat it! Also the most respectful fishing, the way fishing is meant to be. 

And wow, Della Falls is on the list, do you need to take a boat over to get there? Love Lake, it's noted. Hm, yes it seems tricky but I bet you're right about the one-way. Praying for good weather, I guess, is a start. Need your compass skills or a good GPS though, I suppose.

"When I saw your rods before you started hiking, I thought, 'There's an optimist!' but that is the way you get meaningful fish. Decades ago, me and a bud hiked up Joffre Lakes in the first week of May, so we were on our skis. Somehow, our dinner got left in the truck! Luckily, I brought my 6' rod. Balancing on floating logs in ski boots I used the entire pool that was free of ice. I caught a half dozen cutthroat and we had a good dinner. So...is the best fish the biggest? Hell, no, the best fish is fish you need for food!

Also decades back, I did Della Falls solo from Great Central Lake. I dawdled and took most of a day on the lake but caught no fish from my canoe. It is 16 kilometres with only a few hundred metres of elevation gain. What a great walk, though! I walked past a guy and his son who were building bridges over some life-threatening crossings. If you do it, climb up to Love Lake. From the lookout, you will look down on Della Lake and the falls. Just breathtaking. If you can work with the logistics, a one-way trip would be awesome...boat in on Great Central Lake, then from Love Lake go over the pass between Mt. Septimus and Mt. Rousseau, then down to Cream Lake and out through Paradise Meadows.",t2_l8wkv,Pedropeller,0,1610230619.0,0,t1_gip7f0q,gip7f0q,False,RupertMackie,t3_k2uybg,https://www.reddit.com/r/campbellriver/comments/k2uybg/documentary_from_a_4_day_hike_up_mount_albert/,Documentary from a 4 day hike up Mount Albert Edward this summer.

"As a CR teenager (post grad with younger siblings) I would personally say that there lots for young kids, better variety than for teens. Beaver Lodge trails, salmon point trails/oyster river nature trails (beautiful ocean view!), miracle beach, etc. are all great outdoor spots to go to. I also recommend hiking ripple rock trail one day! Maybe when they‚Äôre a little older. In the summer, McIvor Lake is great for swimming and Oyster River has a couple bridges over the river with family friendly swimming holes underneath.

The preschool/daycares I attended were the ones at the community centre (forget the name), and Tracy‚Äôs in Oyster River (it is in the closed-down elementary school), although I have no clue what the waitlists are like. However i remember them both being super fun and engaging. 

The Music Plant in downtown CR is great for instrument lessons if you want to put your kids into that, Strathcona gardens has swimming and skating lessons (don‚Äôt know the COVID rules), Sportsplex has outdoor and indoor activities (outdoor playground, badminton, frolf). Sportsplex also has a skate park, and there is another smaller one by Walmart (connected to a park with a baseball diamond, if you wanna take your kids out for a game). There is a martial arts place on Shoppers Row that does all sorts of lessons (I used to go and it was awesome). Lessons of course, aren‚Äôt free, but I guess I‚Äôm listing as much as I can. 

Avoid: the courthouse/JJ‚Äôs area after 4pm. Sketchy. lol. 

Thinking of the comments on whitewashing and ‚Äúredneck vibes‚Äù - I agree that it is just white people First Nations people here. There are a few other ethnicities I‚Äôve seen here and there, including some immigrants, but primarily whites and First nations. Overall, we aren‚Äôt very ‚Äúredneck‚Äù (pretty sure CR voted NDP last time), and any experiences with racism that I personally witnessed were in high school. Kids (and I don‚Äôt mean to stereotype tooooo much here, but mostly teenage boys) make jokes about First Nations people, will say the n-word (speaking of, there was a big controversy in the teenaged community a few weeks back because someone I went to high school with dressed up as justin trudeau wearing blackface for Halloween which caused a lot of backlash and argument. Again, it was mostly boys defending the boy who dressed up, and girls who were condemning him. Don‚Äôt know how much it matters but just a note of where we‚Äôre at now), etc. Mostly though, we‚Äôre pretty good. I‚Äôve never met an actual Trump supporter here. Most are pretty friggin open-minded, and nice.  I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about the political climate here. By ‚Äúredneck‚Äù I wonder if the comment you read meant ‚Äúredneck‚Äù more in the sense of hunting/fishing/outdoorsy type people. Campbell River is ‚Äúthe salmon capital of the world.‚Äù I know a lot of people who love hunting and fishing here, as well as outdoorsy activities like quadding and dirtbiking.

1. If you are down to play squash you'll have your fill here. I haven't played but there seems to be a pretty active community around it. I assume there is some skill/enjoyment cross over from Tennis.
2. We are here and exist! Honestly I've just scrolled through the Campbell River subreddit and DM'd people who posted posts like yours to ask them to be my friend until I found someone who agreed to hang out with me and went from there.
3. A lot of people seem to enjoy winter sports, like going to Mount Washington. Otherwise just going to the gym or walks in the rain and keeping busy with work and at-home hobbies like gaming or art.
4. There is a housing shortage in Campbell River. Not to say you can't find a place at a reasonable price, but you have to be pretty aggressive about your home hunting to catch a deal the day it becomes available IMO because it is definitely a seller's market right now for landlords here.

"if you have the XB6 modem (or blue curve? or whatever the fuck stupid name it has nowadays) you should be able to to just hook a network switch up to it and run your hardwire to different access points.  My solution for hardwiring was a 30 dollar Netgear 8port switch and 50 feet of Cat6. this is better than their pods anyways because their mesh solution is just... bleagh. 

the sad news is that even if you got the gigabit down with them, your upload would probably not improve that much. (I went with their 750 down and fought for a discount because the best upload they could offer was 20mbps.)

Sucks to hear about your wifi murdering walls though, that probably means your LTE is meh as well, which means this 'air fiber' is probably also a bust.",t2_4aupm,Mananers,0,1606502470.0,0,t1_gdsg3kf,gdsg3kf,False,[deleted],t3_k1rwiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/campbellriver/comments/k1rwiu/wireless_air_fibre_internet_coming_soon_to/,Wireless Air Fibre Internet - coming soon to Campbell River,/r/campbellriver/comments/k1rwiu/wireless_air_fibre_internet_coming_soon_to/gdsg3kf/,2,r/campbellriver,0,2
"I moved from Telus to Shaw last year since after being with them for around a decade they don‚Äôt offer fibre in my area, best I could get was duplex ADSL.

I‚Äôm still tied in a term with Shaw and they‚Äôve been reluctant to upgrade me to gigabit. Currently on a 300mbs, however my Plex server has seen higher traffic and my upload speed seems to be my bottleneck.

On top of that, Shaws router and pods are ass, I need to invest in my own router and just run hard wire through my walls since this old trailer just kills wifi.",t2_aubqy,rwzephyr,0,1606500993.0,0,t1_gdscyav,gdscyav,False,[deleted],t3_k1rwiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/campbellriver/comments/k1rwiu/wireless_air_fibre_internet_coming_soon_to/,Wireless Air Fibre Internet - coming soon to Campbell River,/r/campbellriver/comments/k1rwiu/wireless_air_fibre_internet_coming_soon_to/gdscyav/,2,r/campbellriver,0,2
"As a former Shaw employee, i can tell you that Shaw has been upping its upload speeds everywhere that they can, but here in CR, we're still running on their old hardware, so we're limited to 20mbps up, while everywhere south of us has been cranked up to 100mbps up.  

Shaw is, in theory, capable of supporting higher bandwidths with their fiber backbone, but they're worried about congesting their already close to capacity network. 

Telus at least puts glass directly up to your house (or close enough to your house) to get you the gigabit up... but they don't have any Fiber infrastructure here in town. (I believe they've laid a fiber trunk that shoots right past us and goes towards the north island communities, but who knows what the timeline is on them giving us anything useable here in town. 

Looking at this Quantum Internet Solutions companies website, they seem to just be another Internet reseller who use the existing Shaw/Telus infrastructure where they can,(the giveaway is saying they can provide 'bonded pair' service, which is just what Telus uses in their footprint where they haven't been able to lay glass),  and what looks to be Cellular in the more remote places. 

Twisted pair ADSL can get fast downloads, but is incapable of providing a symmetrical upload, and another check of their website says their fastest upload is 25mbps. 

if you get terrible speeds from Shaw, and can wrangle some savings out of this option, it's a possibile opportunity for you.  if you get decent down and ... barely tolerable up from Shaw, this will be a wash. 

Telus really needs to get their fiber network here.

"Um, *what*?
I have no idea if you live in the area, but you're posting drivel. There is no content, no local interest.... seemingly, no point.

We'll use this post as an example.

* There's a headline about an apparent age restriction.

* There's a picture, yes it's a Subway restaurant, but apparently not one to be found in Campbell River.

* There is no link to a news story, or a question being asked. Like, if you've had a negative experience, and want to know if it's unusual, you would ask.

This subreddit is for things of local interest, not your personal space for random brain-farts. If there is local aspect, put it in there. Ask questions, or bloody well *say something*.

There are places for saying whatever, or nothing at all, or belching out the alphabet. Hell, probably subreddits for those, even.
