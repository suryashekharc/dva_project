"What you say to the police is important.  What you say can be used against you and can give the police an excuse to arrest you, especially if you speak disrespectfully to an officer.  Remember to remain calm and be polite.  Do not lie or give false documents.

I live 3 miles from I/75 Exit 2 Bellville/Lake Park on a farm in No. Florida. Grassy Pond is a good place to go for the public. If you want to go to a private lake there is a large one on the second dirt road to the left coming from the exit as you passed by Pilot truck stop about a mile away but it is a private fishing club. My family owns most of this 300+ acre lake but the only other road to access goes through my farm.

Yes, the exhibits show that Carvajal was aware of Carr’s problematic behavior dating back to 2012.

"When you bonded out, the paper you were given with all the dates is called a notice of arraignment. It lists a year’s worth of arraignment dates because there’s no way of knowing when your case will be on an arraignment calendar in advance! If you call each month, you’ll be fine. It just takes a while for all the paperwork on each case to be collected, sent to the DA’s office for review by an attorney, and then either indicted by the GJ or accused; only once an indictment or accusation is filed can your case be arraigned. DA’s office is the most accurate and quick way of figuring it out each month. If you were today told you’re on an arraignment calendar BE SURE TO SHOW UP or a bench warrant will be issued for your arrest due to failure to appear. At arraignment, you can apply for a public defender (or not) and you’ll be given a copy of the indictment or accusation against you and a notice of the next court dates on your case.

Anywhere near the mall area (Exit 18) is going to be ideal. This is where you'll be surrounded by most of your corporate food places.

Schools: If you have kids in grade/middle school, Hahira or west side is the place to be. However, if you have smart kids, Valdosta High School offers many more challenging opportunities than Lowndes. Their AP classes are just much better. 
Housing is affordable if you can find it. Like everywhere, there is a shortage. 
Medical is more expensive here and quality varies greatly. 
Ironically, groceries are more expensive here even though so much is grown in the US. 
There is a lack of activities for young/middle age adults. Parks and Rec concentrates on kids and elderly leaving out everyone else that actually pay the taxes.

"Don't.  Just Don't. 

I am a Jacksonville Native. As far as Florida, I have lived in Orlando, Plant City, Key West, and Palm Beach County. 

Valdosta is comparable to Plant City, as someone else mentioned, or Cocoa Beach. Trumpers don't bother me, but if you think Trumpers are bad in south Florida, whoa buddy, you ain't seen nothing yet. 

I blend in here. I sound like these people, and can have lengthy conversations about football, hunting, and mud tires. Hell i can make you think I support Trump, when in reality I do not.  I have owned a house here for almost 2 years, which I love. I love it here, as long as I don't have to leave my house. I was a travel nurse when I first moved here, so I was only living here part time. Then I became a staff nurse. Bad decision. I lasted 8 months in that toxic, small minded, small town culture, and went right back to travel nursing.

"I moved here from Northern California a few years ago (military). Based on being in actual big cities, Valdosta is sooo small and rural. The biggest cons for me is limited shopping, restaurant diversity and how far away the airports are. The pros- lots of nature to explore, clean parks, and mom & pop places to support. If you like to eat fish we have a new fish market called Marty’s that has amazing quality fresh fish. We have a few butchers in the area, and several ways to get local fresh produce. Also- if you like thrift markets there are plenty here! I have received a decent amount of aggression from locals here because of my CA license plate on my car (been flipped off and yelled at at least a dozen times in parking lots and while driving). But I have also met some really great locals as well. People are gonna be people no matter where you live. 😂 Also, compared to CA the cost of living here is a dream.

"Valdosta is a big small city ( only saying big cause the towns surrounding Valdosta are small and most go to the larger cities for most things such as valdosta, Tifton, Waycross ) 

Valdosta you have big employers such as the hospital (sgmc -has bought out much of the other small towns hospital so is like this monopoly/ VSU -valdosta state uni / moody airforcebase, which is down the road a little ways but still Valdosta. Lot of military you'll see around. 

There is a large police presence but like top post said it's for the areas they are in. 

You have vsu which has vsu police

Remerton is a small unincorporated place that  Valdosta grew over time and swallowed, now remerton is in the middle of Valdosta lol and has its own police force as well. You will hear alot of the ""remerton bars"" because  remerton is just like a few blocks big and one road is just a bunch of bars. Which sounds cool, it's down the street from college so A LOT OF COLLEGE KIDS GO THERE. So I usually steer clear. 

You have downtown Valdosta which they occasionally hold some events but otherwise it sitting there with potential being wasted I feel. There is a ga beer tasting company in downtown I'd recommend. And the blu pub can be laid back

There have been a lot of negative police reports but it's not like everyday but it does happen and don't be surprised. These mother fuckers go on power trip everywhere but it's not something I see all the time but still enough where it's going on. I just stay away from cops.  The Kendrick Johnson was big here and not too long ago a video came out of a cop breaking someone's arm lol which is weird cause I know that cop guy and I didn't realize he had such a power tripping ego man. People play themselves off so fake.

It is cheaper to live here but you also don't get paid shit lol so it's just about the same to us from where you live. Unless you get lucky and get a really good paying job. Average here is like $10-12 maybe $15 for asst manager in some areas. You can get up to $20 but you have to be big manager somewhere or possible work tech or something very specific. 

We have shit ton of bars, restaurants, retail stores, hookah lounge, gaming areas,we have a theme park close by, Wild adventures (I haven't been for years but it's fun, I miss their wild west theme and the hang man they changed its name to the twisted typhoon ~sigh~ 

Hunting is big here, anything football (Jesus dont watch the show on Netflix please lol titletown is such an embarrassment and needs to be removed)for example when I was in highschool (not Valdosta but smaller town like 20 mins away) they pulled funding from the band to put even more money to the football team. It was so bad for band morale and I wast even in band lol people very competitive here when it comes to highschool football (and regular football) yeah don't drive on the mall side of town when it's game day for lowdnes (we got Valdosta high school (wildcats) and lowdnes county highschool (vikings) you better pick one to say because people might ask 🤣 
I myself don't like football but I manage. 

What else I mean it's like any other place. We don't have a crap load to do that is specific for pulling in tourist because we aren't Florida lol close we got is wild adventures. 
But you can get creative there are things to do you just have to look them up. Like if you are in to making crafts or anything and looking to sale - lakepark is the flea market to go to (Valdosta a joke and I don't think they do it anymore) lakepark is a town lower south in lowdnes county so just under Valdosta.  Ext 5 and shit Valdosta is exit 16/18/22 on I75

There is many gyms you can join if you are interested in that, and classes you can sign up for at different places (my mom does clogging for example in hahira which is another small town down the road about 10-15 mins lol ) you will find community if you look for it. I myself am an introvert and I'm home playing my games and chilling with my gf lol we are taking her niece to the fair in perry ga so like I said there are things to do just have to look them up.

Atlanta is about 4 hour drive, we often get cabins up in ellijay or blue ridge which is a little farther so about 5 hours. You can find places to zip line and kayak (FL is better for kayaking tho you probably know haha cause that's where I go) yeah we are just over the FL line so it takes no time to go to FL , maybe 15 mins to cross over into Florida, Jacksonville is about a two hour drive from Valdosta. Tallahassee is maybe an hour and a half. The malls there are waay better than our mall but you can walk through our mall for amusement lol get a cookie at the greatest American cookie shop.

"Valdosta is a lateral move for you from Florida. I'm not sure where you are from in South Florida, but I'd compare Valdosta to Plant City, rural Lee county, Bunnell.

A lot of people don't mention the poverty, but there is overwhelming, systemic poverty that is abundant in Valdosta. The community chooses to funnel their money into football - and I'm sure the rest goes to line pockets. The infrastructure is falling apart, there is no money invested into arts or culture, and the division between the haves and the have nots is really astounding. Structural violence at it's worst.

"Valdosta is pretty stagnant since covid really hit the state, not much that's new has really come into town and stayed long enough to make an impact. Housing is cheap and if you love sports it's a great fit for most anyone, but if you're not a student or a young family trying to settle down it can be a little intimidating. 

Cops here are not all terrible, but as a white man my experience has still been mixed from the 8 years I've lived here. Our only decent court judge passed away a few years ago (RIP Binder), so I worry more about the pitiful sentences they give out versus the interactions with the police.

"Fair enough, I appreciate your reply! I’m also a liberal and living in south Florida is l hard. Hardcore trumpers every where. If I so much as outwardly express that I don’t support trump I get threatened and once our house was vandalized because we had an Obama sign in my lawn. 

Specifically, I work for Verizon right now and I would be able to work from home, and already have a decent job offer to do that, but my mom works for a mental hospital (we live together/split rent) and her company has an opening for her to move. 

I want to eventually move to Atlanta, but moving to Valdosta is my only ticket out of FL as of right now. And the property is all cheap enough with low mortgages compared to what I’m paying now for rent. (They want to raise our rent by $600 a month. It would be $2000 a month which is absurd and nothing else here is less than $1400) 
We would be living pretty well in Valdosta, I feel. 

I mostly stay at home and play video games as it is now, but I crave a city life/friends and I know Valdosta isn’t going to be that but I feel like it can’t be much worse than I’m doing now. Especially if there’s a university in town. I’m in college for psychology, so im going to look into VSU and if I don’t like it/ it’s too expensive/ there’s not psych program I can always take online classes. 

The median age where I live is 50 and there’s nothing here. No dating scene, no friends, I’m a musician and there are no bands, there is very little for me. 

It seems like worst case scenario my life changes very little and best case scenario I can save up and move again in a few years to Atlanta/Decatur, or so that’s my plan",t2_45ry5ywo,2019inchnails,0,1634350772.0,0,t1_hgtcvid,hgtcvid,False,[deleted],t3_q91nj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Valdosta/comments/q91nj6/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Valdosta/comments/q91nj6/deleted_by_user/hgtcvid/,3,r/Valdosta,0,3
"I've lived here most of my life since I was 9, but honestly didn't feel like I fit in much, because I'm not raised in southern culture, and I'm mixed white and 2nd gen Asian. Most people are solely white or black. I'm also liberal and most people here are Trumpers.

After moving back here at the start of the year and as a 30 yr old, there still isn't much to do. I work from home around farms relaxing with my dogs. Maybe if you hunt or something, there are good places for that?

There are usually interesting events and clubs going on at VSU, but I haven't been since I transferred away, and I'd probably feel out of place. Usually the card/tabletop gaming shops are friendly and nerdy if you are into that stuff like I am.

I think the police are just blown up in the news because of Kendrick Johnson and such, and the 6 agencies I think are Lowndes county, Valdosta, Lake Park, Remerton, Hahira, and VSU.

"Friends Bar + Grille is delicious and a Valdosta favorite. It can be very loud and hard to hear of you are wanting to be a little more intimate.

Mom & Dads is hands down one of the best places in town. I promise!

Guilios doesn’t look like much on the outside but let me tell you there is a little Greek lady inside that makes magic come out of that kitchen. There is never a wait, the sangria is a must, and they usually have live music.

Steel Magnolias has the roof top bar

If you ever want to take someone to something just hands down the nicest and most fabulous thing we have I strongly suggest making reservations at a+b, etc. in Hahira. It’s very fine dining, they only do a couple of events a year, and they only can seat a small amount of people. I would save this option for something special. 

As far as activities go, first Fridays and the art walk downtown; The turner center for the arts has really cool and unique outdoor events that happen often.  I am not sure how much of an arts lover you and your date are but Valdosta State has lots of stuff from theatre performances, symphony, music events, we have a planetarium; Jessie’s downtown does cooking classes occasionally- I went to pasta making tons of fun; of course there’s wild adventures; cottonwood boutique downtown and artist on Ashley do paint parties.  Ga. Beer company is a good time and they often have music and food trucks.

"1) Highly recommend Friends Grille and Bar. It's in a quiet area near Inner Perimeter Walmart. I encourage reservations, but if none are open, still show up, order a drink, and sit under the patio while you wait (no more than 30 minutes). Food is everything from salmon, great chicken thighs, to elk chops. Order the tomato goat cheese! Best appetizer you'll find. Ask for extra bread, it's free of charge. For drinks, appetizers, and meals, it usually runs under $100 or $130 depending on your drink of choice.
2) The Bistro. Expect to stay a while but very friendly down home people. Head straight to the bar without regrets! If you enjoy seafood, they're orysters are great. They have the most extensive drink menu in Valdosta, by far! Similar pricing.
3) Steel Magnolias. Head straight up to the rooftop and grab a nice view of Valdosta. Great drinks. Crispy pork wontons or tuna. Shrimp and grits, or their short ribs are amazing. A little bit cheaper than the other two, but no decrease in quality! Reservations for downstairs only, rooftop is first come serve.

"I just finished watching the show, and going to be honest... Nub Nelson is just as shady as Rush Probst.

To me, it looks like Nub has an inferiority complex, probably due to his accident and he has to be the head honcho regardless. No one hires Probst without knowing the type of coach he his. Nub hired him, saw that Probst didn't listen/tolerate his shit, so he recorded convos to get him fired. There is no way that Nub just got a ""gut feeling"" like he says and decided to record them. They had previously talked about this stuff, Nub agreed with at the time and when their relationship soured (on Nubs side) he decided to record them.

I’m sorry you have been misled so badly. Those are not facts. I would love for you to produce these “facts” and I don’t mean for you to produce them in your basement. None of what you state is true. Most likely what occurred is that he dropped his shoe in the upright rolled up mat (which is how these are often stored even way back when I was in school). He then tried to receive it and was stuck. Had he been in class like he should have been this would never have occurred. I know it’s hard to accept that someone would die a meaningless and horrible death like this but if the school system would be held accountable perhaps something like this would not occur again. There will always be senseless deaths but the key is to learn from them and prevent them in the future.

"I’m new to Valdosta- just moved here in June and so far it’s not so bad! I’ve never heard a shooting here, and it’s a great little town! However, the housing/rental market is absolutely insane. I would try to rent a house before an apartment, and the only way is to be the first on the list. Herndon, Lincoln, and langdale all have their own websites. Check those every single day and apply immediately if something will work. That’s literally the only way. Also, lakeside honestly doesn’t look that bad to me- we checked it out and the area was not overtly sketchy. However, for the same price, you could rent a house that is nicer and in a better area. Don’t be afraid of a commute, also! Closer the the city does get more sketchy, and the outsides of town and small surrounding cities do seem generally more like family friendly suburbs. I guess it’s just a matter of what you’re looking for! Good look!

"No. Do not rent those or that area. I used to live just past those apartments off Tyndall and we had drive by shootings daily. Stay closer to Norman dr, baytree rd, north Valdosta rd.

On Wednesday, June 30, Crews were able to isolate and drain a section of the water main in order to start making necessary repairs. This caused some water customers to lose water supply. The repair was completed around 12:00 p.m. on Wednesday. Crews will now work to reopen valves and flush hydrants. The advisory is being issued out of an abundance of caution – there is the potential a health hazard may exist due to microbial contamination in these areas without positive pressure.In order to protect the public from a potential health hazard, customers that have experienced water outages and/or low water pressures are advised to use only boiled tap water or bottled water for drinking, cooking, or preparing food.  To properly boil tap water for use, customers should:•Heat water until bubbles come quickly from the bottom of the container;•Continue heating the water for one minute once it begins to boil;•Remove the water from the heat source and allow it to cool before use.During a Boil Water Advisory, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that boiled tap water or bottled water be used for the following:•Drinking•Brushing teeth•Washing food and preparing food and baby formula•Making ice•Drinking water for petsOther activities such as clothes washing, dishwashing, and other uses can be done without boiling tap water if done properly.  The complete CDC guidance can be found at this website: https://www.cdc.gov/.../drinking.../boil-water-advisory.htmlThe advisory is in effect until the City of Valdosta has done the appropriate testing to be confident that there is no longer a public health concern.  Customers will be notified immediately when the Advisory is lifted.  Once the Advisory is lifted you should flush all faucets for a minimum of two minutes before using for drinking or food preparation.Thank you for your understanding throughout this emergency repair situation.

I have brought friends over the years who were not into sports at all, but they loved the fast paced game and the people watching is amazing, and if you are there to cheer on VSU you theoretically are instantly friends with most of the people there!",t2_ag2rwazz,Aaron_Kosharsky,0,1624245911.0,0,t1_h2i0iee,h2i0iee,True,[deleted],t3_o41jxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Valdosta/comments/o41jxb/valdosta_dude_here_looking_for_new_stuff_to_get/,Valdosta dude here.

"Ok cool. unfortunately, that’s kind of out of the way from what people typically talk about for Valdosta and it’s “amenities” 

By that I mean The mall, college, 5 points, and Bemis areas are where most “stuff to do” is. You are on the “older” industrial side of things. 

Tho you are close enough to downtown that a bike ride isn’t insurmountable. I’m not sure if they’ve started it back since covid but once a month the downtown area has an event that a lot of people go to. 

Depending on your tastes, Georgia Beer Company is a decent spot to hangout at that is close enough to bike to for you. 

But your post focuses on biking so I’ll try and  readdress that. Grand Bay (off Lakeland highway) on the north side of town has a ton of biking friendly trails, but is pretty far from you.. Freedom Park and its surrounding area is pretty good (bemis/Guest road) like I said. Dinosaur Park is over by the mall and while it won’t look like it at first, there is a trail over there and a pretty cool spot with a train bridge we used to hangout by when I was in college. Other than that, without a car it’s kind of hard to give advice that won’t feel bad because it’s so far away.

"The point of building it there is that McKey is the tennis park; doesn’t make much sense to put it elsewhere. 

I’m not for or against it really. I’m not sure that many courts are needed for this town, but I have to think they’re trying to lure tournaments in. 

I live right down the street and I play tennis with my kids regularly there. Pickleball is gaining in popularity though, especially around Atlanta and some of the retirement areas in north GA. My mother-in-law likes to take my daughter and play. My son and I play it with my daughter when she comes along because she enjoys it more. They’ve striped some of the new tennis courts for pickleball. 

I can definitely sympathize with you not wanting to lose the green space.

"I'm already on a one year dashpass subscription, otherwise I would have been trying the other ones out.

Valdosta has been known for its long time high school football and championships recently won by VSU. Valdosta High School is the winningest high school football program in the country. The VSU Blazers play their home games at VHS’s legendary Cleveland Field. Lowndes High also has a great football program and each year the two play in the annual Winnersville Classic which has recently been dominated by the Lowndes Vikings. Fans are usually out tailgating hours before the football games so it’s not just players family members that attend the games.,t2_az5vxo6u,Simple_Performance_8,0,1618631187.0,0,t1_gusymnl,gusymnl,False,[deleted],t3_mrvfk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Valdosta/comments/mrvfk0/im_moving_to_valdosta_in_the_fall_and_looking_for/,"I’m moving to Valdosta in the fall, and looking for friends, recommendations, or general advice!",/r/Valdosta/comments/mrvfk0/im_moving_to_valdosta_in_the_fall_and_looking_for/gusymnl/,1,r/Valdosta,0,1

"When it comes to second hand shops, I LOVE a little ""hole in the wall"" place called Hope Thrift. They have so much funky stuff in there! Great mix of retro furniture and clothing. We of course have a Goodwill, too. It's always pretty well stocked.

If you're into outdoorsy stuff Grand Bay is stunning. I think there is a small fee for the backwoods canoeing, but the walking trails and nature center are free.

Yearly we have the Azealia Festival in Drexel park. Super family friendly arts and craft festival. But also being a central hub, within 50 miles of here, there's at least 2-3 festivals a month. Pick something and there's probably a festival celebrating it. We even have a Pride festival now!

The biggest attraction around here is Wild Adventures though. It's pretty convenient to have a theme park located about 10mins outside your town. Season passes are pricey, about $100, but considering all the concerts they host, it is so worth it (to me at least).
