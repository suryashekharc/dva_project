"I just bought a house in Cliffside, sight unseen. I moved here from NE 3 weeks ago.

I don't regret it. It's an awesome location, great view and unique non-suburban home. I am 15 minutes from climbing in many directions. My dogs love Dry Canyon. 

It's busy on my road from time to time and what not but I work from home and my wife is all but 4 minutes to work at USU. My neighborhood can be a bit hoity-toity, but I am seeing a lot of young people in the neighborhood that all agree there is a shift change from Boomers to GenX and older millennials on their second home taking over from the people that have owned the house in the neighborhood since it was built.

There was this one mormon dude that came by and over extended his stay saying hi and name dropping and basically proclaiming to be block captain. He really wanted me to know who he was and how he knew everyone and their community involvement and blah blah blah - I am sure every neighborhood has some tool like this that lives off his private Nextdoor/Facebook Gossip group.

I am very grateful to live in Logan. I find the town very interesting and unique, along with Utah as a whole. I put all my money spent into the local economy with the shear volume of locally owned businesses and I absolutely admire that civic pride. I loathe the Home Depot runs, makes me feel guilty; glad I hardly find myself in that predicament often.

I'd say generally though, most people passively expressed the fact that they wish I didn't exist here under the thin veil of ""It's growing so fast here with people from out of state"". Everyone seems to comment on how much Logan has changed, and grown, and how the city can't support it. Those people are generally over 40 and have 6+ kids.

With that said, Providence was our second pick along with a farmhouse outside Smithfield. I think Cache Valley as a whole is an amazing place and caters to so many different lifestyles.

"Short answer, yes. No roosters.

The number of chickens allowed is calculated by the formula 

```Acres * 2 / 0.05```

So, on .1 acres, it's .1 * 2 / .05, or 4 chickens. There are other requirements, like minimum setbacks, noise ordinances, upkeep, etc, and the formula changes if you have other livestock.

"We are currently building right now. From our dig day to now interest rates have increased 2% making our mortgage payment 4-600 dollars more per month than originally expected. So you need to be aware that your interest rate can only be locked for 60 days prior to moving in. So you're gambling a bit especially with rates likely to continue to increase over the upcoming months. That being said we have been very happy with the progress on our home thus far, and we luckily have been spared any delays.

Also I have continued to check the market over the last few months to see what our same price could have bought us had we not chose to build, and believe me when I say, it is slim pickings.

Sure we are on a smaller lot, and it isn't a sprawling 4500 sq ft home, but as first time home buyers with no kids it is suitable for what we need, and we hopefully will be spared the headache of dealing with issues that come with buying a used and potentially run down home.",t2_yb6ns,Jerronbao,0,1647905411.0,0,t1_i1lg1ay,i1lg1ay,True,denisse1617,t3_teeo5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Logan/comments/teeo5y/to_build_or_to_buy_a_home_in_this_market/,To build or to buy a home in this market?,/r/Logan/comments/teeo5y/to_build_or_to_buy_a_home_in_this_market/i1lg1ay/,2,r/Logan,0,2

"Hi! My partner and I started looking into owning a home in November of 2020. We did a lot of research based on our needs and budget, and we ultimately decided to build over buying an already-standing home.

It took over 14 months to complete due to delays and lack of supplies, but it was much more cost effective for us to build rather than try and buy and renovate an already existing home. 

Most of the more ""affordable"" homes are big fixer uppers, and we knew we wouldn't have the time or budget to be able to do them. Granted, we got in on the process right before the big housing mess of 2020/2021/2022 started, but I'm sure the info still somewhat applies.",t2_5u04sjcc,flutegirl96,0,1647313675.0,0,t1_i0pd1mj,i0pd1mj,True,denisse1617,t3_teeo5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Logan/comments/teeo5y/to_build_or_to_buy_a_home_in_this_market/,To build or to buy a home in this market?,/r/Logan/comments/teeo5y/to_build_or_to_buy_a_home_in_this_market/i0pd1mj/,4,r/Logan,0,4

When your kids have friends over, just keep things wholesome and don't expose them to things that would be considered of the world.

Lol, I remember going to one of my non-member friends' house, and his dad had nude model posters in the garage. Being young boys, we spent a lot of time in the garage. Those kinds of things will definitely make parents feel uncomfortable and not want their kids to be at your home. 

(Just in case) Before I get roasted for saying, growing up in a bubble is an incredible opportunity. I would ask you why is it a bad thing? Kids are still exposed to plenty out here in our Bubble, but a larger majority are able to avoid exposure to drugs, pornography, alcohol,  etc...  You still get exposed to those things don't get me wrong, but Utah has been able to shield a lot more than other places. 

We brought another non-member friend with us to Lake Powell from Texas. He kept saying how shocked he was that we could be having as much as we were without any alcohol. Growing up in Utah I would have never even considered that.

"I have the perspective of a (straight cis) kid that moved to Utah and grew up here. My family moved here from the south when I was 9. I knew nothing about Utah or its dominant religion. My family also wasn't religious. When I was younger I made friends just fine; I don't even remember kids bringing up church much. I had some LDS friends and some non-conforming/non-LDS friends too. While I had no interest in religion, the neighborhood kids still invited me to the kids' church activities and dances and such. It was usually the adults that tried to pressure me to become more active in the church. As a teen, the few times I casually dated LDS guys, they made it pretty weird. 

You will get missionaries that try visit your house. I don't know how they manage to sniff out non-members so quickly. And when I was in school, all of the schools past Grade 6 had LDS seminary buildings ""on"" campus. Your kids will probably be asked if they want to take the LDS seminary class in school, so just be warned that's a thing. 

Overall, I didn't feel bullied or excluded for not being LDS. I went to church functions to be with my friends and just tuned out the religious aspects. But I've also managed to find like-minded people in every stage of my life living here. There's a couple of decent bars here where you could probably find some adult social circles too.

You and your wife will be just fine. There are certainly neighborhoods where your LDS neighbors will be closer to each other than they are to you, but you‚Äôll be surprised how easy it is to find nonmember friends.

Your kids are a different story. It‚Äôs not as pronounced of a difference when they get to high school age, and it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôll be friendless, but you should expect that other kids will treat them differently, and that can (but doesn‚Äôt necessarily) include bullying.

I don't think we'll see Ogden get a second temple since there is the BC temple and the new one going up in Layton. The upper Wasatch Front is taken care of.

Maybe it's because I originally grew up LDS until I left in college, and I feel that I'm pretty used to LDS culture, but living in Utah, even in CC, as an exmo is not difficult.

"School can be a little hit or miss, but Logan schools tend to be better for being inclusive than the far flung county elementary schools. The Edith Bowen laboratory school at USU would probably be ideal. Hill Crest and North Logan areas would also be good. Some of the charter schools also seem to be a little more diverse as well.

If you were to attend Sunday skiing at Beaver Mountain, you will find many like-minded families.

Closer to the university tends to be a little more diverse. 

You are not going to be outcasts, but it will take a little more time to find your tribe. It may not be your neighbor next door. I'm not saying you will be treated poorly. Your neighbors will always be friendly, just expect them to be your friends.

If your children transition from age 7 to 8, be prepared to be excluded from birthday celebrations. Most mormon children are baptized when they turn 8.

"Hi! Today was my first snow day driving from Hyrum to Logan (7:30 AM), and it was a very rough drive. I haven't really had to drive much in the valley before (I used to live right next to campus), so I haven't paid much attention to driving conditions before.

I didn't feel like it was going to be such an awful drive just based off the amount of snow we got, but man,  I was sliding everywhere/struggling to stop. It didn't seem like roads were plowed yet either, and I noticed other cars sliding too. 

I'm just wondering, is this normal for snow storms? Is it usually such an awful drive? Was there something abnormal about this one? I'm a bit worried for when a BIG storm hits if just this little one made the drive so terrible.

The grounds and staff are top notch. The cafeteria was particularly good. When I attended, the school was state-of-the-art. The library in particular stands out in my memory.

Edith Bowen also has great resources for special needs children.

Math, however, was definitely not their strong suit. Many of my peers, including me, weren‚Äôt super equipped for middle school math.

"Check out Promontory Point, about 45 minutes west of Logan. National Park where they drove the Golden Spike when the transcontinental railroad was finished (what‚Äôs in the Utah quarter) They have replicas of the trains that were used that they bring out in the afternoon. Look up the time on the website for when they do the demonstration. In October you should able to see the steam really well! It can be really cold and windy, though. They also have a good visitor‚Äôs center with a museum and historical video. 

While you‚Äôre out there also visit the Rocket Garden. That‚Äôs where they are building the boosters for NASA‚Äôs next shuttle. The Garden has an outdoor display of all the old boosters/motor engines that they‚Äôve built, and they‚Äôre massive!

In the same vein, Hill AFB in Ogden has a really cool air museum, and while you‚Äôre in that area you can  also go to Antelope Island. Ogden in general has a lot more ‚Äúcity‚Äù stuff, but Salt Lake City isn‚Äôt really that much further and it is much bigger if that is what you‚Äôre looking for. 

Blacksmith fork canyon in Hyrum is also worth the drive. Hardware Ranch probably won‚Äôt have any elk yet, but it is a nice drive up the canyon to the ranch. 

If you‚Äôre really up to it you can hike up/the length of the Wellsville Mountains, but be warned that they are very steep, and if you‚Äôre not used to the elevation you can worn out extremely quickly. Views at the top are incredible, and on clear days you can see all the way to Nevada and Idaho. 

There are also trails all over the place up the various canyons. To echo another comment, Tony Grove is a must, and the hike from there to Whitepine Lake is awesome. 
 
Can‚Äôt go wrong with an afternoon trip up to Franklin, Idaho, to play the Utah Lottery. Not much there but it‚Äôs fun to say you have. Preston is a bit further, and that‚Äôs where they filmed the movie Napoleon Dynamite, so maybe worth the visit.

Ogden is an hour drive, and Salt Lake City is about 90 minutes. Both of those have a ton to do if you like more city focused things. They also have a ton of hiking opportunities.

Use Raid or any good insecticide. Grab the most effective one and don‚Äôt mind to get the toxic ones. Use them ONLY outside your house, around the doors and windows everyday.

From the inside, use soapy water sprayer to kill all the bugs, to keep toxins out. Spray around the door and windows constantly even if there are no bugs.

"While I don't disagree with the claim there is a bias against students, I don't think it's some nefarious loathing. USU students don't vote in municipal elections, as simple as that. Insanely low turnouts. You know who does vote? Non-students who live in the traditional student housing neighborhoods -- and they vote in incredibly high numbers. Plus they are very involved with the city political process.

If you're on the council, who do you side with? The students, who are basically guaranteed to never vote for you no matter what, or the non-students, who will promptly vote you out of office if you don't cater to them?

As to the petition, Logan isn't known for making exceptions. There are very specific cases where they are allowed to bend the parking ordinance to grandfather in residences without adequate off-street parking. If your apartment doesn't meet the incredibly specific criteria (and most near campus apartments won't), they *legally can't* just decide to grant you an exception.

Dive Bars - The White Owl (pretty dingy but has its charm, especially sitting on the roof in the summer months. But they only sell beer. It‚Äôs a place to go to for a couple beers and a burger in the summer months but not much else)

Coffee - Cafe Ibis, West Side Coffee (both have tasty food options like bagels, muffins, sandwiches etc.. as well to go with your coffee) 

People will suggest places like Angie‚Äôs which is a typical diner type place. I would suggest it but it‚Äôs pretty disappointing for the price when places like herms are much better imo. 

Also Akita in the mall is the same management as the previous Chinese food place taking up the same location. I personally got bad food poisoning there and won‚Äôt go again but it may be better now they‚Äôve changed the menu some.

"Where are you getting this data from? The only data you can find that is accurate for income is census data from 2019. The median household income is ~41000 in Logan Utah. The median household income in America is 67120. That's 1/3 more than that of Logan. The poverty rate is at 27% in Logan, and this was pre COVID. And the rest of the data can't be compared because we have had a housing boom and our prices have doubled. Do you think wages have doubled? Hell no, people still think paying someone 10 bucks an hour can cover anything. And that's for a trades job.

Also, just wanted to add for reference, Detroit michigan's poverty rate is at ~30%. That's where we are headed as a city if things don't change.

"hahah. nah.   
I will say this, and it is just my personal opinion based on anecdotal experiences of living in other places where natural disasters and such prompted shortages and hoarding... but I think it's a bit quicker to happen in utah than most places.   And I think that's because the LDS church, for most of it's history, advocated for a lot of food and water storage in preparation for the 2nd coming of christ.    Most utah homes have a storage room in the basement the size of a large walk in closet that we call a ""pantry"", but they were/are used to store months' or years' worth of canned goods, grains, water, etc...

"I got tested at the Test Utah site in N Logan on Monday. The line was long, all the way down the street and around a corner. It took about an hour to get thru. Before I got in line, I called the community clinic to see if I could get in there but they didn't even answer, so I left a message and got in line. The clinic finally called me back 2 hours later after I was already back home.

As far as results, I did the PCR nasal swab test, because I don't really trust the 5 min rapid tests, and I got my results the following evening.

"Oh and about bigger tips helping..

If a person doesn't tip, it will show up on door dash as an order that would pay around $2. Most drivers know if it's low like this, the customer didn't tip at all. And if it's 4 miles away, and the order screen says the delivery time estimate is in 30 minutes, the order is not likely to be accepted by anyone. That's $4/hr. So after a bunch of drivers decline it over and over, and it's taking a lot of time, door dash eventually will sometimes increase the delivery fee until it resembles a decent payment and someone accepts it. But by this time, the food has most likely gone cold at the restaurant, and it's taken an hour to get someone to take the order and deliver it.

On the flip side, for someone that tips a few bucks for a couple miles away and the order payment seems like it's worthwhile, a driver is more likely to pick it up first thing, run straight there and deliver asap. 

This doesn't always work, like with hidden tips as I mentioned in my other comment, but it definitely helps most of the time. Like, if someone tips $10 and there's a $2 delivery fee, it could still show as a $9 order when in reality it's a $12 payout. But typically, the higher the tip, the more likely it is going to show as a higher payment in the first place, therefore making it more likely that the first driver that gets the order will accept it.

"DoorDash likes to hide the total payout for an order until its completed. So I might see a delivery order that up front says it would pay me $6.50. After I've picked up and delivered and completed all the steps they make me take, the total will come up and sometimes be higher. Not very often though. And it will have it separated into delivery fee and customer tip, and then show a total. If that order has a hidden tip, then we get a message that says, ""Total is higher than the $6.50 shown on acceptance.""

"First and foremost, the thing students and football players need to hear is ""Don't do anything sexual unless everyone involved is 100% into it, and they say as much when they're sober."" Football players *do* hear that, because all students hear that now.

So if the cops are going to give a special talk to football players, they need to be REAL FUCKING SURE it doesn't come across as ""here are some special rules just for *you,* since you're more important than regular students.""

And there *are* special considerations in a Latter-day Saint area, sure. But he could have said, ""'Chastity' is important among mainstream Latter-day Saints, meaning no sexual contact outside of heterosexual marriage. Your partners can make their own choices, of course, but it's important to communicate with them clearly, in a zero-pressure way before anybody gets high or drunk or into the heat of the moment, about what their personal beliefs and boundaries are.

"TL/DR: An honest person found it in the same location I'd looked twice. Lots of weird stuff that I can't explain though.

Okay, I give you the whole story because I'm still trying to figure it out.

The night of the concert, I got home at about 10, realized I didn't have my phone and raved back to campus. The.ticket office manager helped me look around where I was seated. No phone to be found. Check lost and found and same.

I got home and locked my phone with a display message offering a reward with my wife's phone number.

I went to track the phone and it showed the concert hall, but location tracking showed it leaving the hall and said it was moving near the education building.

I buzzed the phone, which one can do remotely even if the phone is on silent, which it was. No reply and then shortly thereafter the phone started showing location unavailable. At first I thought that someone had powered it down, so I made sure Google security notifications were active and went to bed 

I called campus police. No dice. Went to bed.

The next morning, I noticed that the battery was about 10% lower, which didn't make sense if it was off. However, its location was still unavailable.

I went back to campus to look again in the daylight. Still couldn't find it. Another check with lost and found, nothing 

Got  home and the  battery is still dropping, but I can't get a location. I started to think that someone popped out my SIM card.  

The next morning, I woke up and checked my phone settings and the battery was still dropping. Filed a police report. Then later I made a post here as my last hope.

I was literally researching what I could do to replace my phone and my wife received a text that someone had found my phone in the same location I'd looked twice by someone attending a matinee. 

I drove to USU and gave them $150 and came home a happy person.

What I will never understand is why the phone tracking showed it leaving campus, why the location information went away and was unavailable for two days and why my buzzing of the phone didn't seem to work even though it is supposed to even if the sound is off. 

Way more than you asked for, I know.

"> they are in the same block as Le None and Mulligans (soon to be Logan's first wine bar), so there is no reason they couldn't get one in the future.

I think there is a reason, actually -- Le Nonne's is grandfathered in under old liquor laws, and Mulligan's is *just* far enough away from St. John's that the new bar can apply for a license. (**EDIT:** I was wrong, the new bar *is* too close to St. John's and maybe even the tabernacle, but the Mulligan's variance can just carry over to a new owner.)

So Utah liquor laws prohibit licenses within a certain number of feet of a playground, school, church etc. The perimeter used to be wider, but it included a clause that would-be bar owners could go ask a church if they were OK with the bar anyway, and the church could decide whether to sign off on it. I believe that's how Le Nonne's got in, even though they're right next to St. John's, because St. John's gives no fucks about it and probably even welcomes them as neighbors.

In 2017, the legislature shortened the perimeter to 300 feet by shortest pedestrian route or 200 feet as the crow flies, *but they took out the exemption process.* So even though Gonz√°lez BBQ is outside the Logan Tabernacle's perimeter, they're inside *St. John's* perimeter. I'm pretty sure St. John's would be absolutely OK with Gonz√°lez getting a liquor or beer license, but they no longer have a say in the matter. 

Lucky Slice was going in right when these rules were about to take effect. They maybe could have gotten a beer license right before the door closed on them, but AFAIK they decided not to, and now they'll be dry until the liquor laws loosen up or until the apocalypse, whichever comes first

**EDIT:** Just double-checked on the DABC site, and the perimeter is only 300/200 for restaurants. It's 600/200 for bars, but a new bar can carry over Mulligan's variance.",t2_13c767,fantastic_beats,0,1639424764.0,0,t1_hof25sv,hof25sv,False,GeekSumsMe,t3_re4v4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Logan/comments/re4v4c/new_texas_bbq_in_logan/,New Texas BBQ in Logan!,/r/Logan/comments/re4v4c/new_texas_bbq_in_logan/hof25sv/,2,r/Logan,0,2
