"no traffic los banos to most parts of san jose is only an hour or a little bit over. So its obvious why los banos is becoming a new hot spot. All the 1 hour cities in the north valley have been exploited for years for bay area people: tracy, mountain house, manteca, lathrop. Mountain House and tracy homes are easy $700-900K for new construction or anything decent. That is absurd. They were as cheap as los banos years ago, under $200K for brand new. With north valley pretty much done, when people hear los banos is an hour to san jose, and new homes could be had for mid to high 400s, you can see why people would easily take that. The commute is horrendous if its anything more north of san jose but the potential in los banos is clear.

Merced is on a come up thanks to the UC. it can be liek a UC Davis and the college will only help merced continue to grow and thrive.

*Foxwood (Farmer's Markets) -* if you like Commonwealth and Churchkey, you're going to love this storefront fixture in Modesto's Farmer's Market.

*Pizza Plus -* Ripon (technically not Stanislaus but meh) - Best pizza hands down, gotta try any pizza or my fav mozzarella sticks with garlic

*Michael's Pizza Bar and Grill -* Modesto - Great pizza and prices, good place to watch a game and drink beer

**Chinese:**

*Mei Wei -* Modesto - Honestly have not really eaten at a bad Chinese restaurant in the area, but this is my favorite, can't go wrong with anything really.

"I cannot stress enough saying this but to anybody out there reading this , DO NOT COMMUTE and pay for it out of pocket. Work in person very close to home, work remotely, if it’s a job out of town that wants you, make them pay for your fuel there and back.  Those are the options.  Yep, working remotely is definitely the way to go, of not at least VERY close by. I got licensed to do taxes last year and the company I went through wanted me to communicate from Modesto to either Tracy or Stockton to work out there every day(I live in Modesto). I tried it last season for a bit and with the fuel prices then it was definitely not worth it. I told them that I can either work remotely out of that area or within a VERY nearby radius of my home if wanted in office and I won’t travel far. I’m SO glad I made that change when I did. My rule for any job out here now is it MUST be within a couple miles form my home if it’s not remote and if a business wants me to commute THEY must pay for the fuel for that commute, no negotiations.  My husband has his fuel fully paid for at his work. He works in Stockton and makes the daily commute from Modesto to Stockton. The only reason he he stays there is that they pay for his fuel driving to work and home(he works for family, they pay him crap but he can negotiate certain things). They tried balking at paying for his fuel with prices going up recently. He made it clear to them too that if they make him pay for his fuel, he will quit on the spot.  They can either pay for his fuel or fully pay his moving costs to move to Stockton near by work and give him a big raise due to high rent costs. They kept paying for his fuel because they don’t want to loose him.

"There are so many Merced folks who love to bash on Merced.

I moved here with my kids in 2015 after living all over the U.S. (and beyond). They were 15, 9 and 7 when we arrived. They love it here and even my oldest chose to stay here for college rather than go elsewhere. My youngest likes to say “it’s a small town with everything you need.”

Compared to other places, the people here are down-to-earth and friendly. Y'all don't know how icy it can be in bigger cities.

I grew up in a Central Valley town even smaller than Merced. One of the reasons I wanted to come back to the Valley is because I see that it's a great place for kids to grow up because you can be yourself and make friends. As a parent, I don't have to worry about the streets being too scary. (I've lived in NYC, Miami and Mexico City - so I know how rough it can be elsewhere.)

Yeah, the town is pretty quiet and, thus, folks call it Mer-dead. So, there aren't any great clubs to go to at night? Then, get your friends together for a house party. No cover charge! No ""cool"" chain stores to shop in? OK, spend your dollars at the local shops, find some thrift-store treasures or just put the money back in your pocket and save it. If you’re bored, that’s on you. There are tons of ways to build your own fun here.

There are movie theatres, sports leagues, biking and hiking trails nearby, lots of volunteer groups, churches galore (if you're religious), really cool car clubs, locally owned coffee shops, and an emerging downtown arts scene (which has been slowed by COVID, but is starting to pick up). In a small town, it’s easy to get involved in things.

The growth of UC Merced is breathing new life into the town. (It’s UC alums who’ve opened some of the cool newer businesses downtown). The city is working to make downtown even better, renovation of the mall is underway, a new plaza is being built in north Merced, etc…

Folks call it Mer-dead and, on the one hand I hate to see people bashing this town but, on the other hand, that’s fine, I’ll keep enjoying life here before the secret of how cool this place really is is out.

"There is nothing natural about water flowing down the Sacramento River year round. Prior to the dams being built the sac river only flowed after it rained. For months during the summer back then the river was dry. This categorically refutes any environmental argument to the contrary. Salt water intrusion, water temperature, smelt salmon are all fake reasons why so much water is allowed to be wasted flowing to the bay. The real reason is most of the towns on the sac river release sewer water into it. These towns don’t want to spend money on water treatment. So really, the sac river is one giant toilet that needs to be flushed and politicians are using water needed for farmers to fill grocery stores to do it. It’s criminal.

Imperial emerged in first place among California counties for highest rate of unemployed drinkers with nearly 20,000 excessive drinkers and an 18.3% unemployment rate. Santa Clara placed last with 210,252 problem drinkers and a 2.5% jobless rate.

Tulare County had the highest local ranking at No. 4 with 50,843 excessive drinkers and 9.6% unemployment.

Fresno County came in at No. 7 with 108,962 problem drinkers and 7.2% unemployment.

"You mentioned living in Fresno for 5 years. So you're familiar with the triple digit temps from June till September? And also the humidity. I've been in the south San Joaquin Valley for 25 years and last summer was the worst I can recall. Over 100 degrees every day. With maybe a few 98-99 degrees here and there. When it dips to 90 we call that ""sweater weather"". 

Yes house prices are way below the bay area and Southern Calif. as well. But there are trade offs. The culture can be a bit conservative but that has changed somewhat in the last 20 years. Of course that may be good or bad depending on which way you lean.

I personally love the lack of traffic congestion and dense development. It doesn't take much time to be out on a country road with only farmland as far as you can see. If you want to buy property out in the country be careful. Agricultural  designation can mean a chicken ranch or cattle dairy can go up next to your ""dream home"". And farmers don't take kindly to other people's dogs running loose on their property. Please don't think I have anything against those folks but those are the facts.

"Where in Fresno did you live? That could tell a lot on what you are comparing it to. If you lived in north fresno or clovis. Basically, any comparable area/neighborhood in the sacramento area would be easily at least $100K more.  
You have to ask yourself if you can take the increase price and if you really need those added amenities. Fresno is technically bigger than sacramento, but sacramento METRO area is 2x as big as fresno metro area. Because of this, sacramento area has more to offer and if you get bored where you area, you can go to one of the other thriving cities in the metro area. Meanwhile as you know in Fresno, all they really have is Clovis. Nearby madera has nothing really, sanger, reedley etc. If anything all those places go to fresno/clovis. Sac is also closer to the greater bay area. If you live IN SAC, you can get to SF in less than 2 hours, and any other parts of the bay around there. Meanwhile in Fresno, San Jose is the only and closest major bay area city about 2 hours. Not counting Gilroy (technically is part of the bay being in santa clara county)  Weather is better in Sac, pollution isnt as bad, and although summers are as brutal, at least it cools down in the evening with the delta breeze, while fresno does not. You still get a good bang for your buck in the fresno area, its still a big city with most stuff you find in other big cities, but because of its smaller metro area and no other thriving cities close by, it feels more secluded. If money wasn't an issue, Sac wins, but if you are trying to save money, Fresno is ok if you can accept it's short comings",t2_suonh,MoDa65,0,1644433805.0,0,t1_hw9g910,hw9g910,True,Pepsoreal,t3_so55mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralValley/comments/so55mk/i_live_in_the_bay_area_san_jose_but_housing_is_so/,I live in the Bay Area (San Jose) but housing is so expensive.

Apartment List, another apartment research company, pegs the median price for a one-bedroom rental in Fresno at just over $1,050, and a two-bedroom apartment at around $1,300 as of February, showing a 15.3% increase from the year prior.

This is the second year in a row that Fresno’s skyrocketing rent has been among the nation’s highest. In 2021, an Apartment List study found that Fresno’s rent increase in 2020 was the second-highest in the nation at 10.8%, and the city had the highest four-year rent increase in the nation.

The 2022 Zumper National Rent Report comes at a time when the city is grappling with how to address an increasing homeless population and lack of affordable housing amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic

“The increase in rent has been far greater than the increase in wages in our city, leaving a lot of our folks priced out of the market,” Fresno City Councilmember Miguel Arias said at an affordable housing news conference in January.

City officials have said on many occasions that affordable housing is one of the city’s top priorities; in October, Mayor Jerry Dyer said, “Housing and homelessness together are really the defining issues of our time.”

Dozens of Fresno residents have reached out to The Bee in the past year, reporting that the high cost of rent has forced them to stay in unsafe or unhealthy living conditions, move into hotels and motels, or out on the streets.

Throughout the past year, the city of Fresno has initiated several affordable housing projects, including single-family in southwest Fresno, multifamily housing along the Blackstone Avenue corridor, acquiring motels for temporary homeless shelter and implementing an affordable housing trust fund.

However, statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau show the rental vacancy rate in the Fresno metropolitan area stayed below 2% for a majority of the past two years. The low supply and unavailability have contributed to rising rental rates and kept people from finding secure housing.

City leaders were set to hear policy recommendations from the Here to Stay report meant to curb displacement and homelessness in Fresno at the Feb. 10 City Council meeting; however, the hearing has been moved to a later date, according to an email from the city.

The policy recommendations — 46 in total, 15 of which have been prioritized by the city’s Anti-Displacement Task Force — include rent control, Fair Chance housing for people with prior convictions and a full right to counsel.",t2_suonh,MoDa65,0,1644279365.0,0,t1_hw0kw14,hw0kw14,True,MoDa65,t3_sn5jv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralValley/comments/sn5jv8/fresno_ca_tops_national_list_for_highest_rent/,Fresno CA tops national list for highest rent increases,/r/CentralValley/comments/sn5jv8/fresno_ca_tops_national_list_for_highest_rent/hw0kw14/,5,r/CentralValley,0,5

"Oh my goodness. What a sweet baby. Please don’t drop him off at a random location. 

Try posting on r/Fresno. That sub gets pretty steady coverage.

Also, this is 100% someone’s cat. Either it got out and got lost, or else someone very cruelly drove it out and abandoned it. 

Either way, the BEST WAY to reunite lost pets is to (1) take to vet to scan for microchip; and (2) print flyers with the cats picture and put them in every mailbox within a quarter mile. 

Most lost cats are less than a mile from home.

"I grew up skiing and switched to snowboarding as a teenager.

Skiing is much easier to pick up and if you are reasonably coordinated there is a good chance of you making it down the hill unscathed your first day. Snowboarding is a lot less natural and difficult to get to a point where you are confident on both edges.

Once you have the basics down there is a near infinite learning curve for both. If you have never done board sports before (wakeboarding, skateboarding, etc.) and your focus is going up and having a good time, definitely try skiing first. If you don't mind a sore ass and and an increased risk of failure, go ahead and try snowboarding.

"In general skiing will be easier to pick up casually and will involve a lot less bruises than learning to snowboard will. However it also depends on transferable skills from other athletic activities; do you water ski, ice/roller skate or go running a lot? Then skiing will be a much easier transition. Do you skate board or wake board? Snowboarding will probably be a smoother way to transfer your athletic skills and use your muscle memory to gain a leg up on the learning curve.

I worked at China peak for three years and it's a great mountain to learn on as an adult or as a child/teenager and they have pretty good instructors if you want to take lessons (I suggest that you take at least one lesson unless you have friends that are willing to spend a full day teaching you), plus decent food (chefs John, Keith, and Roger are awesome and kind and absolutely hilarious), local beer (Tioga Sequoia) and all around cheaper prices than you will find at any of the other resorts in California.

"80 is east/west.  Maybe you're thinking ""north"" through Berkeley, Richmond, etc.  which is eastbound.

In my experience, 80 in the East Bay is always crappy.  On weekends it's especially crappy westbound (towards the bridge/City) all day long as tourists flood into the City in the morning/afternoon, and residents flood back home in the afternoon/evening.  Check out Waze or Google Maps randomly throughout the next couple of weeks.  That will give you a good picture of the situation now.  Keep in mind, this is still somewhat pandemic time (the further east you go, the less the pandemic seems to be impacting folks' behavior, but that's another story).

Not all Ag it the cars and trucks that contribute the most not Ag. We have to have food. It also is the way the valley sits closed on the South mountains East and West traps the bad air no where to go. Plus we get the bad air from up North blows down to us. And the fires don’t help matters. The law suit won’t change anything unless we get money to help stop the fires but that will take years. Good luck get out if you can.

"I think the best place to start for folks would probably be the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) [Annual Report to the Community 2020-2021](https://www.valleyair.org/General_info/pubdocs/2020-21-Annual-Report.pdf). This gives a good synopsis of the issues.

The issue is that the air is different every day and some sources of pollution are present on some days, but not others. Measuring air quality isn’t as easy as saying one pollutant (nitrogen oxide, ozone, or particulate matter) has decreased and we’re all good. For example, ozone — also known as smog — levels fluctuate depending on the weather, the time of day and the number of cars on the road and they interact with other pollutants. It also depends where you're at in the Central Valley.

At the north end, more of the air pollution is stuff that has migrated in from the Bay Area and Sacramento (as much as 30%). But at the south end mobile sources make up a higher percentage of the pollution. I think it's just critically important that we kind of think of this in a systemic, holistic way and really take advantage of this moment to sort of say we can do better.",t2_fwsmi6ff,aBetterCalifornia,0,1638807110.0,0,t1_hnh14m7,hnh14m7,False,aBetterCalifornia,t3_r9l5vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralValley/comments/r9l5vg/central_valley_coalition_suing_the_epa_over_clean/,Central Valley Coalition Suing the EPA Over Clean Air Failures,/r/CentralValley/comments/r9l5vg/central_valley_coalition_suing_the_epa_over_clean/hnh14m7/,2,r/CentralValley,0,2
"Not quite. If you look closely, this is about our state government not devoting enough effort to meet the air quality standards set 25 years ago.

"I'm going with ""depends on which part of the Valley"". People tend to talk about the Central Valley as if it's a political monolith, but forget that it's 450 miles long...there's a LOT of variation. 

The Valley tends to be purple in the middle (Sacramento to Stanislaus counties) and gradually gets redder as you move north or south from there. It starts shifting purple again as you reach the southernmost areas around Bakersfield. 

Central Valley Democrats tend to be more ""traditional"" than Bay Area or Southern California Democrats, with more support for the military and less support for reformist activism, but with a heavy focus on supporting the poor and combating regional environmental issues (less-so global ones). Central Valley Republicans tend to have a much stronger libertarian streak than Republicans elsewhere in the country, and their political philosophy can be summed up as ""Get the goverment out of my fucking life and leave me alone."" Trump support is high, but I've found that most Valley Republicans aren't actually hardcore Trump supporters (though the Trump supporters are VERY vocal). They'll vote for Trump again to unseat Biden, but most were perfectly content with Bush or Romney style Republicanism. 

Central Valley Democrats and Republicans are both supporters of big ag, which underpins most of the Valley economy.",t2_jigwr,codefyre,0,1637011666.0,0,t1_hkrr368,hkrr368,True,throwawaypdtm,t3_qu6lx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralValley/comments/qu6lx6/what_are_the_politics_of_the_major_cities_and/,What are the politics of the major cities and population centers of the Central Valley like compared to the areas surrounding it?,/r/CentralValley/comments/qu6lx6/what_are_the_politics_of_the_major_cities_and/hkrr368/,1,r/CentralValley,0,1

"I'm a 5th generation Californian and I think the politics in the Central Valley are of a mostly common sense conservative variety with a much better sense of reality than most people give them credit for. The population largely votes Republican, but with good reason. 

For decades the Central Valley has largely been neglected by our single party state government. Even Gavin Newsom agreed with this idea, saying in his [state of the union](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/02/12/state-of-the-state-address/), 

> ""The people of the Central Valley endure the worst air pollution in America as well as some of the longest commutes. And they have suffered too many years of neglect from policymakers here in Sacramento. They deserve better.""

Indeed, CV residents do deserve better. Culturally being left alone was good, but economically it's been disastrous. The valley faces some of the highest levels of poverty, air pollution, unemployment, income inequity. The systemic problems facing Central Valley residents essentially robs Democrats of the argument that electing them will lead to good governance and good policies being enacted. It is especially worrying that deep blue coastal areas of California all seem to have the same bad policies enacted that everyone recognizes are bad, but are unable to resolve.

But without any real challengers for their seats, California's Democratic politicians have developed a strangle hold on our state that is choking the very people that they claim to protect. Their supermajority has turned Sacramento into a mini-Washington DC, where serving the special interests of Big Labor and Big Business matters more than serving Californians.",t2_fwsmi6ff,aBetterCalifornia,0,1636990601.0,0,t1_hkqa1bc,hkqa1bc,True,throwawaypdtm,t3_qu6lx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralValley/comments/qu6lx6/what_are_the_politics_of_the_major_cities_and/,What are the politics of the major cities and population centers of the Central Valley like compared to the areas surrounding it?,/r/CentralValley/comments/qu6lx6/what_are_the_politics_of_the_major_cities_and/hkqa1bc/,10,r/CentralValley,0,10

"It is a mixed bag. 

I lived in Bakersfield for a year for a post graduate program and found it was very conservative.  I didn't know anyone there besides one other person who had been placed there for the program as well. I am religious and tried to go to church to perhaps attend a young adult group or something, but most people my age(mid-late twenties) were already married or married with children.  This church also had a woman pastor which seemed to fairly radical for the area even thought it is a  regular occurrence for that denomination. 


I now live in Stanislaus County and it not quite as conservative but definitely more so than where I grew up in the Bay Area.  
There has definitely been a lot of grumbling around my workplace about how people don't won't to work anymore since the company is having a hard time hiring. However, a lot of those same employees are so low income that they qualify for some government assistance.  Other coworkers have surprised me with more liberal leaning comments but these also tend to be the people who are in positions requiring a degree.

"I am a liberal Democrat who moved from the Bay-ish area to the Valley (Tulare County), a few years ago, and booyyyyy is it different. I would say 75% - 85% of the people I know or meet are conservative/Republicans. And like, angry conservatives too. Maybe angry is too harsh of a word...more like, empassioned, lol. My friends included. I have learned not to talk politics with anyone unless I want to end up in an argument. There's a lot of t-shirts, hats, billboards and bumper stickers I have to laugh and shake my head at. Covid and masks and vaccines are obviously some of the most sensitive subjects we are all dealing with right now, and that whole deal is what kills me compared to the bay area. I swear I get weird or judgy looks for wearing my mask to the grocery store, cause I will literally be the only person there with on one. It's honestly kind of a trip living here as a transplanted 'Lefty', and feeling like a fish out of water. When I'm around young adults/college-aged kids though, they seem much more progressive and liberal. The few liberal-minded friends I have made since moving here, I treasure. I love going back to the coast and visiting my friends and family, it is always a huge relief when you can criticize Donald Trump without getting shamed or rebutted.

"The initial idea that higher density areas were at greater risk of infection has already been debunked with data by the California Department of Public Health. Sadly, as a result of this initially flawed assumption many of the smaller counties received less funding from the state to combat transmission. This was detailed in a [state auditors report](https://www.auditor.ca.gov/reports/2020-610/index.html).

In fact, while two of the 16 large counties — Los Angeles County and Riverside County — had 989 and 776 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively, two smaller counties — Imperial County and Kings County — had significantly higher numbers of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents during the assessed period — 3,215 and 1,525 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively. Based on the COVID-19 case data for all counties, the needs of many small counties, as reflected in case rates, were at least the same if not greater than the needs of large counties, which is contrary to Finance's reason for allocating additional state CRF funds to the large counties.

What I think the latest data reflects, is that transmission and case rates are more closely linked to socioeconomic drivers than population density. So things like poverty, access to healthcare, unemployment, income levels are much better predictors of regions at greater risk for sustained transmission.",t2_fwsmi6ff,aBetterCalifornia,0,1636040614.0,0,t1_hjalxuy,hjalxuy,False,ForeverCanBe1Second,t3_qf1i2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralValley/comments/qf1i2e/stanislaus_county_were_4_in_california_counties/,Stanislaus County - We're #4 (In California Counties with the Highest Covid Death Rate),/r/CentralValley/comments/qf1i2e/stanislaus_county_were_4_in_california_counties/hjalxuy/,2,r/CentralValley,0,2
"While the information you've provided is interesting, it's a very shallow understanding of what's going on. First, the data being touted is what they call crude data. Crude rates are influenced by the underlying age distribution of the counties population. Even if two counties have the same age-adjusted rates, the county with the relatively older population generally will have higher crude rates because incidence or death rates for most COVID-19 infections increase with increasing age.

The age distribution of a population (the number of people in particular age categories) can change over time and can be different in different geographic areas. Age-adjusting the rates ensures that differences in incidence or deaths from one year to another, or between one geographic area and another, are not due to differences in the age distribution of the populations being compared.

I would also suggest that anyone thinking about these things, also needs to begin looking at socioeconomic linkages to these higher crude rates. Data from the California department of health have shown that areas with high poverty, high unemployment, lower educational attainment are at risk for higher rates of infection. The Central Valley has been home to all of these things for several decades and thus the risks have always been higher for the region. 

That's not an excuse for not being vaccinated mind you, but I think it's a much deeper and broader view of what's going on in the Central Valley. Population risk and management for diseases requires more than a knee jerk reaction and fixing the problems associated with low vaccination rates is not going to be a quick, nor simple fix.",t2_fwsmi6ff,aBetterCalifornia,0,1636039976.0,0,t1_hjak9yg,hjak9yg,True,ForeverCanBe1Second,t3_qf1i2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralValley/comments/qf1i2e/stanislaus_county_were_4_in_california_counties/,Stanislaus County - We're #4 (In California Counties with the Highest Covid Death Rate),/r/CentralValley/comments/qf1i2e/stanislaus_county_were_4_in_california_counties/hjak9yg/,1,r/CentralValley,0,1

"Death rate has remained pretty constant and because it takes a few weeks for the virus to run it's course, death rate isn't a true indicator of what is happening with infection rates.  Throughout the pandemic, Stanislaus has had higher death percentages than most parts of the nation.  I can't find the screenshot right now from last year, but at our peak last year, we had a fatality rate of 2%, we're currently at 1.5%, still significantly above the national average.  

Scroll down on this page for results for today:   [https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/)

In answer to your question, I don't know why there is a drop in cases.  According to your chart, we still are averaging almost 200 cases a day which is better than the 400+ we had in September but this doesn't put us out of the woods.  

Obviously, if vaccination rates would go up, this would help lower our fatality rate but the only other thing we can do is to follow Covid guidelines - which for Stanislaus County, mandates mask for everyone indoors.  Mask wearing and social distancing WILL lower the infection rates even more.  This has been proven time and time again:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883189/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883189/)

(Please note that these are Peer Reviewed Scientific Studies)

As of right now, the one major defense we have that has been **scientifically proven** to lower infection rates, is the use of a simple surgical mask.  It's such a no brainer, there is no reason that mask wearing should ever have needed to be mandated by government.  As a society, we should want to help slow the spread of Covid.  Covid doesn't give a flying fuck about our manufactured petty political beliefs but, for many, Covid has become political.  

But since our area refuses to do the right thing, mandate or no mandate, we will probably continue to have a higher fatality rate than many other parts of the nation.  Eventually, we'll reach herd immunity or it will mutate into something less deadly, but in the meantime, I guess we all need to accept that we live in a county populated with more than our fair share of sociopaths.  And the price we will pay, is a much higher fatality rate.

"Visalia is a nice town. I’d move there if I wasn’t tied down and wanted to stay in the San Joaquin valley. Somewhat small, decent schools, large enough to have most of what you’d need nearby.

There aren’t a huge number of Union jobs available in the private sector. Municipal construction, some dairy processing facilities, and a few other food processing plants. $20/hour is decent for the area. It’s definitely possible to do better, but probably not if you are jumping into something without experience.

Be aware in food and ag sectors. Sometimes the work is seasonal, leaving you SOL if you don’t have a plan B once the season is over. There aren’t as many oil jobs in the area you’re describing, and although oil sector jobs aren’t “seasonal” they can often be very dependent on the price of oil. Large numbers of layoffs are pretty common when the price drops drastically.

Generally speaking, if you can get a full time job you’ll have more money in your pocket at the end of the month than you would probably have in LA.

"I live in the L.A. area, too, and follow this sub and am on other internet platforms with information about relocating and living in Central CA.  I've also been considering a move to the Central CA area because cost of living has increased to ridiculous rates since I moved to L.A. in 1997.  It's also gotten more crowded here, more traffic... just more of everything that I've finally decided I'd like to avoid and find a quieter place to live.  So that's why I follow this sub and other platforms where I can gain info about Central CA.

In my experience on this sub and other places online, a lot of Central CA residents consider their cost of living high, but that's because they haven't lived in other cities like L.A. or the Bay Area to compare to.  In fairness, cost of living in Central CA *has* gone up, but not exponentially the way it has in L.A. and the Bay Area.

Those in Central CA who *have* lived in L.A. or other larger cities will usually tell you that cost of living in their location, while it has gone up, is still much more affordable than L.A., as some commenters here have done.

Take that for what it's worth and consider the source when asking for advice about Central CA.  In my experience, besides just my research online, but based on looking at actual rents and travelling in some of those areas, cost of living IS less expensive than L.A. and you can build a nice life for yourself and family if you have one, have a nice house, etc.  

I've heard good things about cost of living in Merced in northern Central CA.  It's been a growing, developing college town since UC Merced set down roots there in 2005.  I work in public education in L.A. and have known a few students who got into UC Merced for college, found living and working there so amenable, found jobs almost immediately in the area after college, that they convinced their families to move there and find a better quality of life.

"> Yet even here, the water table in the aquifer has been falling. The reason, Cosyns said, lay elsewhere. ""The surrounding areas are pumping the water out from under us,"" he said.

> Those farmers own land that's outside the irrigation district, and they don't get water from the dam on the San Joaquin River. They pump from the aquifer every year, making withdrawals but no deposits. Under the new law, that will have to end.

The goal here is to stop drawing from the aquifers, in that they are limited resources that can be depleted.  This is something that landowners recognize needs to be done and they’re working together on the issue.

"This is the future of the Central Valley, at least for the near future. 

The underlying phenomenon is not only remote work, although that is certainly playing a role. Low interest rates, and a massive influx of cash from the federal government that has largely ended up in the hands of the finance industry has driven speculators to purchase housing. A shortage of materials and construction/trade labor has also made it slow and expensive to build new housing.

The best we can reasonably hope for is that the rate of rent increase will slow down. But rents are going to continue increasing over the long term as part of an ongoing trend of the US focusing on a rentier economy, rather than an industrial economy. And California has been leading the charge toward de-industrialization, as financial capitalists seek scarce profits from our husk of an economy by squeezing every dime possible from a smaller and smaller set of productive workers.

Sorry for the rant. But the housing crisis in the state is deadly serious, and all signs point to it getting worse.

"They definitely did not start working on the medical school at UCM a decade ago and in fact only start getting serious about it getting initial talks of funding not too long ago.

There is a physician shortage but not necessarily in terms of actual numbers but more so where they are located. Most doctors are concentrated in larger cities. A possible solution to this is to make it more enticing for doctors to work in underserved and rural parts of the country and also of course recruit more diverse applicants in the first place in terms of lived experiences, geographical locations, etc.

I would need to see a source of that tens of thousands of international medical graduates because it definitely is difficult but there are plenty of residency programs open and accepting of foreign medical graduates to their programs.
