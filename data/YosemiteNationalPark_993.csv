"This picture means a lot to me.

I come from Florida which is, in my opinion, geographically an extremely boring place.

My visit to Yosemite in October 2021 felt like my first time experiencing the true beauty that Earth has to offer.

We took a bus tour from South Lake Tahoe to Yosemite (not the preferred way of experiencing Yosemite, I know) and we had a seemingly perfect day. The sunrise was bright pink and orange. The weather coming in to Yosemite was overcast by the time we got to the park, but it still beautiful. Tenaya Lake was crystal clear, flat, and majestically reflected the surrounding mountains. Once we got to the valley the sky had cleared up and it was all views like the one I posted. Even some of the falls were flowing even though they usually don’t around that time of year.

"If you're into old ""ghost towns"", Columbia State Park is only about 30 minutes little off route. It's a pretty cool place to visit, but there's  a LOT to see and it can easily eat an entire day. Still, stagecoach rides, gold panning, tours through tons of awesome old buildings. It's always a stop I'll recommend if you have the time.

If you like old trains (or the Back to the Future movies) and want something a little quicker, Railtown 1897 State Park in Jamestown is only about 15 minutes off-route if you're taking highway 120, and the entire park can be toured in 90 minutes (a bit longer if you want to ride on the train). The park is basically an old train roundhouse full of steam engines and passenger cars. They have several old steam engines, including the train from the Back to the Future movies, along with a handful of props from the movies filming. If you actually want to ride the train, buy your tickets online ahead of time because they do sell out.

"* Wine tasting and good breweries in Livermore - many locations with convenient access from 580.  Adds an hour for a short visit.  The wine is average for California but still decent.  Altamont Brewery is well known and popular.
* [Bass Pro Shop](https://goo.gl/maps/RUr93RJCz2RyiBjh8) and a [Costco](https://goo.gl/maps/2NxxERtwFKoXAtTc9) in Manteca (along the first stretch of 120) for any last minute supplies you need

* The [Kwik Serve](https://goo.gl/maps/8VRMuwje9oopeEMZ6) in Groveland is the best place to get gas before heading into the park.  **You will want to fill up before entering the park, even if you're 2/3's full.**
* The [Iron Door Saloon](https://goo.gl/maps/5D7UpMkj6SvoH9rr6) in Groveland is the oldest operating saloon in California.  Feels like a regular bar with old pioneer-stuff hanging on the wall.
* [Rainbow Pool](https://goo.gl/maps/vtAAB7y8uCVxWFQw6) - near Yosemite's Big Oak Flat entrance.  This is a must do IMO and only needs 10 min to see it, feel free to stay longer.  Swimmable if the water isn't flowing too fast.
* [Carlon Falls](https://goo.gl/maps/5K6P7NenJbcWd2rEA). This is an easy hike to a minor waterfall.  If you have time on your way back to SF, it's a great way to sneak in that last Yosemite experience.

Not sure about snow conditions higher up but early season there is often a trail closure where the trail crosses Wapama Falls. People have died trying to cross the bridges there.

"I’d definitely choose Mist Trail over Yosemite Falls. I think it has far better views/scenery. Mariposa grove will also take much longer than you think. You’ll have to add a legit 4 mile hike (2 miles there and back) just to get to the grove trailheads. Then you’ll have to go at least a mile or so to get to the Grizzly Giant, which is the closest best attraction. The area is spread out with tons of individual groves around multiple trails/loops. I think it would be really hard to do Mariposa>Mist Trail/other hike>tunnel view in time for sunset, especially due to all of the driving. I would recommend staying in the valley for the day—hiking in the morning, then enjoying the valley, then sunset.

"If you are limited for time, you might want to look at a map and reconsider the order of this. You're backtracking a lot depending on where you are coming in from. Tunnel View to the Grove is about 45 min driving each way, so you'll be burning a lot of time driving to come almost all the way back to the Valley for Tunnel View last. 

Also consider that the Mariposa Grove shuttle will not be running until early June, so it is a 4 mile round trip hike just from the parking lot to the entrance of the Grove. Probably doing a longer hike in the Valley plus driving to the Grove and hiking is pushing daylight unless you start very early. 

Personally I would do Mist Trail all the way to Nevada Falls over Upper Yosemite, but it depends what you're looking for. Mist Trail has less wide open vistas but you see two huge waterfalls at very close proximity.

"Ya, when are you planning on going? If May 20th or later, you’ll need a day use reservation, last I checked there was quite a few available though.

Personally opinion, 9am is to late to get there. Aim for 7,  8 at the latest. Between potential traffic and trying to find parking, earlier the better. 

As for views, hard to say, it’s been years since I’ve been up Mist and JMT but it was very cool. Only did Upper Falls once but it’s a good view, though I’d say there’s probably better views in the valley you can get if you’re looking for a strenuous hike. Definitely recommend checking out the Mariposa Grove, it’s very cool and Tunnel View is awesome but I can only imagine what a shit show it is at sunset, just something to keep in mind. 

That’s a long day but sounds awesome, enjoy!",t2_8dtdh3pf,Mikesiders,0,1648156521.0,0,t1_i1zdqj0,i1zdqj0,True,KodiakGrizzlyBear3,t3_tn4ky6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tn4ky6/advice_needed/,Advice needed,/r/Yosemite/comments/tn4ky6/advice_needed/i1zdqj0/,1,r/Yosemite,0,1

This is true.  OP, when I've visited in the winter time, even with a rental car, I rented chains from one of the shops in Mariposa - just in case they were doing checks.  Never needed them, but I didn't want to risk being denied entry.  It was only $25 or $30 to rent a set of chains for the week and they just rode around in the rental car's trunk.

"You will need a day pass permit to enter the park from 5/20 to 9/30. You don't need one to enter in April.

Highway 120 is a mountain pass that closes for the winter. It is incredibly unlikely to be open in April, so this will be a long detour for you around the Sierras. Also, Glacier Pt Rd is closed for winter and then construction in case you had memories of any specific hikes off that road. You can get there from the Valley via 4 Mile Trail, but that is also currently closed for winter/trail maintenance. It might open up by the time you visit. When you visit in April, plan to be limited to hikes from the Valley, Wawona, and Hetch Hetchy areas.

Tioga Rd being closed doesn't really impact the rest of the park in winter from a getting around perspective because everyone just enters from the west. Here's a visual of the roads: [https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wroads.htm](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wroads.htm)

"Thanks for the post and the replies. It's reassurance of our plan this April.    


We are planning to camp at LYV on the nights of the 27th and 28th of April, with a day hike to Half Dome( I know the cables will be down). We'll arrive in the valley on the 26th to get our permit.  I understand that we can camp at the Backpacker's campground the night before the date on our Wilderness permit, if it's open. The Backpacker's campground is open if North Pines is also open. This web page([https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm)) indicates that North Pines will be open starting April 11th, so I'm hopeful the Backpackers campground will also be open on the 26th.   


Then on Friday the 29th, we are hoping we can get a walk-in campsite at Camp 4 for three nights while we do some climbing in the area.

"As far as I know you only need to check in on the first or by the second day for them to hold your reservation the whole time. If you do not check in by the second day when the ranger leaves the booth than your reservation is forfeit. Some people only camp in a car or van,  but then take the vehicle with them to the trailhead or day trip to another area of the park before returning to the same campsite they reserved, so it is not unusual to see a campsite that looks empty but is actually still being used.

I believe the reservation system online will not let you cancel just one day in the middle, though it will let you edit the date range. If it will not let you cancel only the middle day online, I know that if you call the ranger booth for the campground they will be able to cancel only the middle day for you.",t2_62u7c,zombaxx,0,1648052646.0,0,t1_i1t9jvo,i1t9jvo,True,JJB911,t3_tkx9t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tkx9t6/camping_question/,camping question,/r/Yosemite/comments/tkx9t6/camping_question/i1t9jvo/,2,r/Yosemite,0,2

The weather may change unexpectedly, so bring a couple thick jackets with a hoodie. Bring your hiking shoes, of course. Also, idk if you have a hiking pole, but bring it! 

Mosquito repellent is also must along with a flashlight if you plan on hiking at night. If not thats okay.

">I’m pretty concerned about the logistics of trying to drive into the park, find parking, and make it to the trailhead on the morning of my backpacking trip.

There are several scenic and pleasant Forest Service campgrounds just east of Tioga Pass, including [at least one that is a walk-in for backpackers](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recarea/?recid=20610) 1/4 mile from the road—in the same style as Yosemite's backpacker camps—that often has space in the morning. All are usually first come with no reservations. With 300+ campsites out of service at Tuolumne, I don't know how much demand there will be; maybe a whole lot.

First off, holy smokes it’s a hard climb with a full pack, we really could have packed much less water than we did to lighten the load.  Plenty of water along the route to filter.  It felt like it was straight up the whole way there.

We ran into really bad thunder storms about 2/3 the way up, at one point my wife was growing concerned when it turned to hail.  I said at least we are not above the tree line, then I’d be concerned.  Soon enough and sure enough we cleared the tree line with it still lightening.  Not a great time for a bit.

We camped before the bridge.  Once we cleared the hill and head towards the creek, we never saw another person.  Actually, we didn’t see another person from the time we left JMT that being until we got back on the JMT in the AM. 

It was dead quiet at night back there, made all the bear precautions etc, but we never saw or heard a single animal back there. 

We hightailed it out early AM for LYC to hike Half Dome, our plans were thwarted by an early afternoon thunderstorm. So we ended up going up there the third day in the AM.

"Yosemite Falls is well worth it.

I've seen all sorts of bodies at the top.  If you are in decent shape, you can do it.

You won't get lost, the trail is super easy to follow.  Up top, it's kind of a maze of social trails, but there's so many landmarks with good lines of sight you will be fine.

The Upper Falls overlook is a must see, provided you are ok with heights.

Depending on how much you have left in your tank, Yosemite Point is well worth it.

It is safe.  The biggest safety point for solo hikers: don't go off trail.  I cannot emphasize this enough.

It's been a grotesquely warm winter.  Expect to get hot on the upper part of the trail.  This might change as your date gets nearer, we can get big April storms.

Get up and start early.  Take lots of water and snacks.  Take your time, one foot after the other, be like Dory: ""Just keep hiking, just keep hiking!""  If you don't have them, get hiking sticks, your knees will thank me on the trip down the hill.

"Having been in a 1 on 1 situation, I can say it was a big surprise, but ultimately a cool story and experience. A bear surprised me from about ten feet out approaching my camp, likely looking for food and not even noticing me. I stood up, made noise and loudly talked at the bear and it casually changed its coarse. Spooky sure, for the moment but seeing wildlife like that and realizing you’re okay had a profound effect on a lot of levels. Respect their space, know you’re in their territory, but remember they pretty much want nothing to do with you.

There's no shortage of videos of black bears mingling close or with humans.  Make loud noise if you encounter one and it looks like it might approach.

"My friends and I climbed up to the bottom of the cables on Monday, 21 Mar. Sub Dome was pretty snowy; we used microspikes on the way up but descended via class 2-3 granite slabs because the snow was too slippery even with spikes. I’d recommend the granite route for the ascent, or take crampons; the steep snow with spikes was a little dicey. It’ll probably melt a lot this week though.

Half Dome itself was mostly dry except for a few 5m sections of ice where the cables were completely buried. We watched one group solo up the bottom patch and retie onto the cables above it but they slipped multiple times. They didn’t attempt to solo the higher patch which was much steeper and the consequence was approaching fatal. I think it might have been possible if we had a 20m rope to belay the leader with and the leader had ice picks or something. But even then, you’d have to build an anchor out of prussiks, which isn’t very safe. And the slush on top of ice on top of granite is not a reliable climbing medium. With all the sun and warm temps this week, it may melt out.

A nice backpacking trip/loop would be to hike (parts of) the North Rim: go up Yosemite Falls across to North Dome and down Snow Creek to exit out of Mirror Lake. A side trip to Eagle Peak is well worth it IMO, but adds mileage (in the opposite direction of the loop).

"\+1 for panorama trail from Happy Isles to Four-Mile Trail (and in that direction) as being the single best hike you can have, especially now that Glacier Point Road is closed, with the following comments: 

1. The side trip to Sentinel Dome (and Taft Point for the most courageous) is well worth it IMO but adds 3 miles roundtrip.
2. The 4-mile trailhead bus stop (E6) is on a different route/shuttle than the Curry Village Stop (14), meaning that you will have to wait for two different buses to get back. As such, I recommend walking over to the Sentinel Bridge bus stop (11), unless you can't fathom an additional (flat) mile or so.

"To get the most out of Yosemite in a day, I would go for 

Mist trail -> panorama trail -> glacier point -> down 4 mile trail. Then shuttle back to the start. I think it's around 13 to 16(alltrails says 13.4, I don't believe it) miles if you can handle it. Nonstop amazing views every mile. You could also do this in reverse, but I personally hate going down the mist trail against the crowds. Starting at around 6-7 am, you should have few people crowding the mist trail. 

Sunrise lakes to clouds rest is also a great long hike. It's my favorite view of the valley, you look down at half dome from 1000 feet above. Though you see a lot more variation in the mist trail to panorama hike. 

Upper Yosemite falls is a tourist trap in my opinion. There are better views out there for the effort you put into it.

"Great question! Unfortunately I’m struggling to think of an answer! 😅 

I’ve heard that living in the hubbub of the valley can be exhausting with so many tourists all the time, but I didn’t have to deal with that much. All the stores within easy reach of my residence were very expensive, even with regular things like food, but I also got two meals a day provided so it was never a great burden for me. I think most people in and out of the valley room with other people, so roommates could be a problem, but I got some pretty great ones. It got very smoky during the KNP fire of course. 

It’s probably not for everyone but I loved just about every part of the experience.

"This permit won't get you on the JMT. This permit goes up Illouette Creek, not the Merced River that the JMT follows for a bit.

There are ways to link up with the JMT near Thousand Island Lake via this trailhead, but it won't be a ""true"" JMT hike, if that matters to you.

What you can do if you want the JMT is to hope for a ""walk up"" permit from Happy Isles or Lyell Canyon (both marked Donohue Pass eligible), or a walk up NOBO permit from Cottonwood Pass/Lakes from Inyo National Forest. Cottonwood Pass is non-quota before the last Friday of June, so if you start before then, you're guaranteed a permit.

"was gonna recommend Mt. Dana which is a relatively short hike at 7 miles round but also pretty intense at about 3k feet of gain and you're starting at 10k feet.  One of my favorite hikes I've done and the views on a clear day are insane.  If you start early and pace yourself it might not be too bad since you'll already be a bit acclimated.  I'm not sure if you're more concerned about mileage and being out all day or elevation gain or both so I thought I'd float that idea.  If you're going late enough into the season there's a strong chance there won't be any snow up there so you can see the trail.

"If you fly into Reno, there is a east Sierra Transit bus on 395 from Reno to Lee Vining and then early in the morning a YARTS bus that stops in Lee Vining on the way to Tuolumne Meadows. All camping and the grill are closed in Tuolumne this year but you should be able to pick up a permit and backpack.

If you fly into Sacramento (or Oakland), Amtrak and YARTS will sell you a combined ticket into the park at Yosemite Valley from the Amtrak web site with well-timed transfers. From Fresno or Mammoth airports, you should be able to arrange a YARTS trip into the park as well.

There may or may not be a hikers’ bus this year connecting the Valley to Tuolumne. YARTS also connects them but at inconvenient times.

There are permits left for the less popular trails, but you may want to enter the week-ahead lottery instead.

Granted, Subdome and the cables are on the other side.

As someone else mentioned, the granite can be extremely slick. I'd be extremely nervous if there's any ice or moisture on the ascent. 

Despite a climbing harness, going up when it's slippery is very dangerous (and possibly fatal).

"You can't get lost unless you're talking about just finding the start of the trail.  It's just straight to the back of Camp 4.  Definitely don't pay for a guide, but make sure your shoes are tied.

I hike a lot and it's a tough hike and not one that I'd recommend for a day 1 hike.  Something like Nevada Falls is a good day 1 hike.  Also, the way down is probably worse than the way up.  No steps sounds nice, until you realize steps only exist on popular trails and they make a hike easier.  Four Mile Trail is 400 feet more in 1.5 miles more and I think is significantly easier because it has steps.  It also took me less time.

The waterfall will be pretty when it comes into view (not most of the hike).  Outside of that, it doesn't have the best views.  Four Mile Trail has incredible views.

Temperature-wise, it's going to be variable, but as someone who isn't used to cold weather, hiking in 40 degree weather is fine.  More than likely you'll be closer to 60 degrees, so have options.  Just keep moving and you'll stay warm.

"Yosemite Superintendent Cicely Muldoon has stressed that electrical concerns in the trailer park are the “sole driver for taking this action,” but also said Yosemite plans to turn trailer park into a public and administrative-use campground for recreational vehicles, with campground construction slated to begin in 2024.

In December, NPS also said the site would be used as a construction staging area for many major Yosemite projects in 2022 and beyond. This month, that changed to, “Currently, there is no alternative use planned for the trailer court area in 2022.”

Another car rental tip that hasn't been mentioned yet: check your credit card for car rental benefits - a lot of credit cards offer damage/loss/LDW insurance if you pay for the full rental car with it.

"If you work or are affiliated with a company/university which has an agreement with the rental companies, you'll get a much better deal.

"H!  Here are some thoughts:

* Glen Aulin HSC is a horse camp.  As such, it usually has people and their horses in it.  I have hiked past it for camp every time I've been there...I'm pretty sure you can walk past it to much better campsites unless something has changed.  The trail from Toulumne to Glen Aulin is pretty but it isn't spectacular.  You will see lots of people on that section.
* I don't remember the elevation gain from Glen Aulin to Tenaya.  It looks like you factored that in with a relatively short Day 2.  If you go down the gorge the trail gets pretty wonderful with lots of great campsites BUT I would avoid the idea of climbing out via White Wolf if I were you.  It is a pretty serious climb.
* Tenaya is really nice but it is close to the road and there will be people there.
* Cathedral area is really nice.  The JMT crowd will be long gone, so you should have relative solitude.

Overall, your plan sounds doable and you should have a good time so long as you don't mind being around other hikers/civilians.  That said, the end of August might not be too bad since it is getting to the end of the season.

Something to consider:

* If you have two cars, hike from Toulume to Hetch Hetchy.  Lots of great scenery and really memorable camping.  Park one car at the end and drive back.  In my experience, hitch hiking can be a challenge down there.
* This is a trip that I put together in 2017.  That would be a good five days and is super remote:  [https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=11.1/-119.4793/37.9798&pubLink=LZ2aFXRPMHFUnvBgSBASHzik&trackId=76f82fd1-acb0-48f1-a2fe-544d4290e869](https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=11.1/-119.4793/37.9798&pubLink=LZ2aFXRPMHFUnvBgSBASHzik&trackId=76f82fd1-acb0-48f1-a2fe-544d4290e869).  We climbed out of White Wolf but you could either walk back up the Grand Canyon of the Toulumne or shave some time off by hooking up with the PCT at Seavy pass, then walk back to Toulumne.  Highlights here include Matterhorn, glaciers at Burrow and Mule passes (I call them the Passes of the Asses), and Kerrick Meadow, which is my favorite meadow in the whole park.
* You could also hike from Tenaya down to Curry Village and take a shuttle/extra car back to Toulumne.  You would get to see Cloud's Rest, which is a good peak to bag with amazing views, and then drop down past Half Dome and bag it if the cables are still up.",t2_3nca3,fitzgerh,0,1647367573.0,0,t1_i0s1b61,i0s1b61,False,couchumina,t3_tdmf3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tdmf3h/possible_hike_with_14yo_suggestions_on_things_to/,possible hike with 14yo .suggestions on things to look at on this route,/r/Yosemite/comments/tdmf3h/possible_hike_with_14yo_suggestions_on_things_to/i0s1b61/,2,r/Yosemite,0,2

"I just looked at https://www.travelyosemite.com/lodging which is the official in-park hotel booking site. It looks like the whole summer is still available. 

If you're a lazy traveler like me, get a room inside the park from that site. You're guaranteed entry. 

Curry Village (""glamping tent hotel"") is the closest to the misty trail, and if you want to keep going past vernal falls, the panoramic trail will take you up to glacier point. 

Curry village is a tent with electricity and heating (costs extra). Showers are communal and come with soap. If you're lucky, you can grab a curry village cabin which is a wood cabin with a built in bathroom. 

In the valley, Housekeeping Camp and Curry village are the ""budget"" options (tents) going from $70-$200/night. Yosemite Lodge (motel rooms) is ~$200-300. Ahawanhee (hotel w/ lobby) $300+. 

Wawona Hotel (hostel with communal bathrooms + hotel rooms) is about an hour away from the Valley, but is within the park. 

Tunnel View: Sunrise, sun in your face. Sunset, sun at your back.

The Ahwahnee Hotel Lobby/Great Room is a pretty chill place after your hikes. 

The main ""entrance"" to Yosemite falls where everyone gets the [iconic shot of the treelined trail](https://www.yosemitehikes.com/images/ns/lower-yosemite-falls-trailhead-700sq.jpg) is not next to the bus stop, but actually next to the lodge parking lot (Intersection of Yosemite Lodge Drive and Northside Dr).

We left around 4:30, timed to reach a diner in Oakdale when they opened at 6.

"Hey Bearcat9948!

So, I made a Google Maps itinerary that would be helpful to follow once you get to the park. Of course, you'll need to begin in San Jose and then make your way out to Yosemite National Park by taking this route:

**I-680 > I-580/205 > I-5 (for a few minutes) > Hwy 120** 

[https://tinyurl.com/SJtoYosemite](https://tinyurl.com/SJtoYosemite)

You'll be on Highway 120 most of that route through the central valley through the ascent up into the Sierra. There's some great spots as you approach Yosemite (such as Moccasin Point). You might be tempted to stop at some of these spots; however, make sure that you don't take too much time. **Believe me:** ***Yosemite is even better!***

Tip: Be mindful of gasoline. Your gas options are very limited once you get near the park. Your vehicle will use a bit more gas during the climb up into the Sierra. There's a gas station/convenience store roughly 5.4 miles from the Yosemite National Park sign, so we almost always stop there and gas up (and use the restroom).  

Now that you've arrived with your camera and a tank of gas, you're ready to enter the park. Here is the Google Maps itinerary:

[https://tinyurl.com/bearcat9948](https://tinyurl.com/bearcat9948)

There are some spots not included on the map. So, let me go over them for you:

1. **Yosemite National Park sign**: This is a great for your own personal memory of the park -- and a right of passage for NPS enthusiasts. There are some parking spots next to it, so you can jump in and out. Hopefully, someone will be available to snap your pic while you stand next to (or sit atop) the sign.
2. **Tuolumne Grove**: This is a relatively moderate and short hike (about an hour -- albeit at a higher elevation) that takes you down to a wonderful Sequoia grove. Given the elevation, there will likely be snow on the trail (so you might want to check before you leave and wear appropriate shoes). You'll being at the parking lot and hike about 1.4 miles to the grove. Even though I live in the Bay Area (with access to plenty of giant Redwood trees), I've always enjoyed this relatively short hike. [https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tuolumne-grove](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/tuolumne-grove)
3. **Big Oak Flat Vista Point**: This is a fantastic first good look at the Yosemite Valley. It's simply a parking area where you can walk and take in the views. 
4. **Bridalveil Falls**: Now, the trail is currently CLOSED for renovation. However, you can park along the road and hike up the approaching trail and gets some wonderful views of Bridalveil Falls. You'll simply need to park along the road (Southside Drive) and get as close as you're able. When it's open, you're able to hike all the way to the bottom of the falls. It's amazing.
5. **Yosemite Valley Chapel**: This is a scarcely visited yet amazing little chapel nestled in the most beautiful chapel in the world. It's a quick stop -- but amazing to see.
6. **Mirror Lake:** For this stop, I've added a parking lot that is the closest to the Mirror Lake trail. At the entrance to the parking lot, you'll walk east along a paved road for about two-tenths of a mile until you find the Mirror Lake trail on your left. Once on the trail, you'll hike slightly less than a mile to Mirror Lake (below Half Dome). It's popular because you can capture the reflection of the surrounding mountains in the lake. TIP: Lower your camera or smartphone low to the lake and try to capture as much of it and the mountains above in both the lake (the reflection) and the mountains. [https://cdn2.outdoorphotographer.com/assignments/598587/assignment-354-iconic-locations-andersonjamesr-0-1544492265.jpg](https://cdn2.outdoorphotographer.com/assignments/598587/assignment-354-iconic-locations-andersonjamesr-0-1544492265.jpg)
7. **Yosemite Village/Village Store**: There is a lot to do around here. I always stop at the Village Store (corner of Village Drive and Ahwahnee) and pick up some souvenirs (it's a big store with a big selection). I usually stay parked there and walk over to the area of the Visitors Center. There are museums, shops and other interesting things -- including the historic Yosemite Cemetery. If you don't want to walk, you can drive over and park next to the cemetery and walk across the street to the Visitors Center and adjacent attractions. These all have **BATHROOMS**.
8. **Lower Yosemite Falls**: This trail allows you to park on the side of the road and walk on a boardwalk through the meadow to a beautiful vista point for the falls. It is less than a half-mile and magnificent! 
9. **Yosemite Lodge/Base Camp**: It's a nice little food court with BILLION DOLLAR VIEWS of Yosemite Falls! It's worth the stop if you're hungry. **BATHROOMS** 
10. **Hanging Valley Viewpoint:** It's simply a wonderful vista point to see the valley, mountains and El Capitan. 
11. **El Capitan Viewpoint**: An even better vista of El Capitan. You can sit hear and dream of *Free Solo*.
12. **Tunnel View**: This isn't on your map....but a MUST SEE spot. You'll park at one of two parking lots and then look EAST to the valley. Hopefully, you'll get here in the mid-to-late afternoon with the sun at your back. It will provide arguable the best view of Yosemite from the Valley elevation. It is magnificent. You'll see Half Dome, Bridalveil Falls, El Capitan and everything in one vista. In fact, after you take some shots with your camera, you might want to drive through the tunnel, turn around and come back to the valley through it. It's spectacular! 

**With this, your day adventure will be complete.** 

I should add that you'll see some amazing things that aren't included here. Just take your time and take them in! You might see some amazing wildlife -- including some amazing bears. There are some stunning spots throughout the valley. All you need to do is park and take it all in. 

I didn't ask if you wanted to take any longer hikes. That would be difficult for just one day -- but they are incredible if you'd rather do that. I can give you some ideal first-time hikes too. 

Unfortunately, Glacier Point Road is currently closed. **Glacier Point** arguably offers one of the best views of the entire park (and the entire world). Best of all: It's as simple as driving up the mountain, parking and walking a few hundred yards to the vista points. Glacier Point Road is not too far from Tunnel View. However, you'll be able to do that on a return trip when the road is open. 

Tip: You might want to bring along some food and drinks. In fact, you might be able to eat from your car (instead of Yosemite Village or the Base Camp) if you find yourself running short of time. 

I hope that this helps. It is possible to spend just one day trip to Yosemite and enjoy it immensely. 

**TIP: START YOUR DAY EARLY!** You'll want to get to the park as early as possible. When the entrance gate opens, the lines will be long by 10 AM -- perhaps even taking an hour of your day. If you arrive early enough, you can avoid that congestion.",t2_y8lda,chrismireya,0,1647241246.0,0,t1_i0l945z,i0l945z,False,Bearcat9948,t3_tdb3wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/tdb3wf/is_it_worth_trying_to_day_trip_from_san_jose/,Is it worth trying to day trip from San Jose?,/r/Yosemite/comments/tdb3wf/is_it_worth_trying_to_day_trip_from_san_jose/i0l945z/,3,r/Yosemite,0,3

"Long day but entirely possible. You can cover most/all of the major sites in the Valley in one day. You won’t probably have time to see any places out of the Valley but that is pretty limited this time of year because of closed roads due to winter. In the Valley I would suggest hitting, in counter-clockwise order to match the road circulation, Tunnel View, Bridalveil Falls (very limited chance due to construction there), drive back and park at Curry Village Parking lot, ride shuttle to Mist Trail trailhead and walk/hike up to Vernal Falls footbridge (good trail but with some steeper parts), take the shuttle to Mirror Lake, walk to Mirror Lake, optional shuttle to Ahwahnee Hotel to walk around the historic lobby area, shuttle to Yosemite Village, hit Ansel Adams Gallery and Visitor Center, walk to Lower Yosemite Falls and do Lower Yosemite Falls/Cook’s Meadow Loop. Then option shuttle ride to shuttle Stop 11 to Sentinel Bridge for classic view up Merced River to face of Half Dome. Then ride shuttle back to your car and then as you drive out of the Valley stop at El Cap Meadow to see El Cap, optional short hike up to base of El Cap, then drive to Valley View viewpoint, and then exit Valley. Be sure to download the official “National Park Service” app and download the Yosemite content for offline viewing before you leave the Bay Area. It is really good, especially for first timers. Study maps of the Valley too (including shuttle map) before you get to Yosemite, so you have an idea of where everything is, spatially. Also, get a copy of the park newspaper, Yosemite Guide, when you enter the park so you have the maps/info it provides.

Red peak pass is 11,200 ft and north-south facing, so the north side is going to hold snow.

I did PCT thru the Sierra in a low snow year like this one (2018) in early June and we still had 1+ mile of snow on the north sides of passes, and patches on the south side. The snow would pretty much be gone by 10.5k ft. But sounds like you’ll be in the Sierra about a month prior to when I was out there, so I’d add a thousand+ ft and mile or so more to those estimates. 

In the forest, it could be a patchy post-holing mess once you hit 8-9k… but depending on how hot it gets could melt faster. If that’s the case, it’ll be muddy from snow melt.

"As others have said, October is usually a good time to go: cool in the mornings and pleasant during the day. Keep in mind, however, that the weather is more unpredictable, the days shorter, and you are more likely to have wind, rain, or even snow (rare but still a possibility).

Your expectations of ""\[avoiding\] crowds"" may be misguided. I've done it many times around that time (i.e., September to November) and ""crowds"" have varied from 2-4 people to large groups of 10+ people making it feel like a normal permit-day on HD.

"Thanks for offering a free option for this. It's so cool of you to dedicate your time to make this available to everyone. I too miss the serendipity of checking for cancellations a couple times a day and actually finding one.

I noticed that Campflare doesn't have every site on [recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov) (e.g. the Haleakala cabins), but it appears the paid sites do. When you say you have access to their availability data instead of scraping the site, is that an API they provided, that maybe has an incomplete set of locations?

I want a cabin and haven't had luck when they're released, but paying for access feels like contributing to making the situation worse. I wish they would use a lottery in more places.
