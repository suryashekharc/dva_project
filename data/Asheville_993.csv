"> stop saying acab and circlejerking about how bad the police are is a good start.

Who's doing that?

> They're workers like you and me.

They're really not, though, are they, unless you work for the city and taxpayers cover your salary? And if you do, then good for you, yay public-sector workers. But unless you're a cop, you aren't granted the right to kill people under certain circumstances.

> Oh and following lawful orders is a good practice as well. 

Except when it isn't and cops fuck up. (See: Philando Castile.)

But you're still not answering the core question: what does it mean for cops to be ""supported"" and how exactly do we know when we have achieved an optimal level of support? Because it feels like ""support"" is meant to mean ""never imply that someone whose salary you pay might not be doing a good job"" which is not something conservatives apply to, say, teachers.

We support cops by... paying their salaries. We support street sweepers and park maintenance and garbage collectors by paying their salaries. I guess we support garbage collectors by putting our garbage out every week in the right receptacles and we support park maintenance when we don't poop in the parks, but there's no big ""garbage collectors feel unsupported"" thing going on.

"I was taking a brief hiatus! thanks for the page.

I was a bit shocked to hear they wanted and got a six lane track; I didn‚Äôt understand it to be as large of an ask or expenditure as it ended up being.

east end valley street had a lot of conversations with parks and recreation when the bond money was slated to improve the stadium. it was the slow mobilization of parks and recreation that kept the improvement from happening before more parties took interest. 

the pandemic has made a mess of civic engagement, people are more detatched than ever and seldom have a fraction of the opportunity to cross paths than in the past. the city plays games, parks and recreation under the previous leadership was a case study in how to disenfranchise communities. 

as I understand it, the current parks and recreation maitenance facility next to memorial stadium was a vacant building that was offered to east end valley street, weeks before they pulled a switcheroo.

"> Since June 2020, the mental health clinicians and paramedics working for Denver‚Äôs Support Team Assisted Response program have covered hundreds of miles in their white vans responding to 911 calls instead of police officers.


> They‚Äôve responded to reports of people experiencing psychotic breaks and people screaming for no apparent reason. They‚Äôve helped a woman experiencing homelessness who couldn‚Äôt find a place to change, so she undressed in an alley. They‚Äôve helped suicidal people, schizophrenic people, people using drugs. They‚Äôve handed out water and socks. They‚Äôve helped connect people to shelter, food and resources.


> The program, known as STAR, began 20 months ago with a single van and a two-person team. More than 2,700 calls later, STAR is getting ready to expand to six vans and more than a dozen workers ‚Äî growth the program‚Äôs leaders hope will allow the teams to respond to more than 10,000 calls a year.


> The Denver City Council last week voted unanimously to approve a $1.4 million contract with the Mental Health Center of Denver for the program‚Äôs continuation and expansion. The contract means the program that aims to send unarmed health experts instead of police officers to certain emergency calls will soon have broader reach and more operational hours.


> The city has rapidly expanded the program‚Äôs budget from the $208,141 in grant money spent to launch a six-month pilot program in June 2020 to the $3.9 million allotted in the 2022 budget.


>‚ÄúSTAR is an example of a program that has worked for those it has had contact with,‚Äù Councilwoman Robin Kniech said Monday before the council approved the contract. ‚ÄúIt is minimizing unnecessary arrests and unnecessary costs ‚Äî whether that be jail costs or emergency room costs. It has done so for less than 1% of the calls coming into the city that it might be eligible for. It matters that we‚Äôre scaling it up.‚Äù


>About a year after STAR launched, Aurora replicated the model ‚Äî one of many cities in Colorado and beyond to find inspiration in Denver‚Äôs new program. The program‚Äôs staff has been bombarded with requests for more information by officials and organizations across the country hoping to launch similar programs in their hometowns.


>‚ÄúI feel like the last year-and-a-half has been a blur of all the cities and counties that have reached out to us,‚Äù Richardson said.


>More expansion may be needed
Since its launch, STAR‚Äôs paramedics and clinicians have responded to more than 2,700 calls, according to Carleigh Sailon, STAR operation manager. STAR providers haven‚Äôt called Denver police for backup to any of their calls, she said.


>But those 2,700 calls are only a fraction of what STAR could‚Äôve covered in that time period if the program was larger. Sailon said there were approximately 11,000 calls to Denver emergency services that could‚Äôve been handled by STAR in that time.


>Most of STAR‚Äôs calls for service come through Denver 911, where dispatchers are trained to send the STAR van for appropriate needs. But about a third of calls are from Denver police officers who responded to a call and determined it would be better handled by STAR.



>‚ÄúOfficers consistently ask when there are going to be more STAR vans,‚Äù Sailon said.



>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the future of law enforcement, taking a public health view on public safety,‚Äù Denver police Chief Paul Pazen said of the program in a 2020 interview. ‚ÄúWe want to meet people where they are and address those needs and address those needs outside of the criminal justice system.‚Äù



>Cervantes, like Richardson and Sailon, also has received a flood of inquiries about the program from other organizations and city governments. Cervantes said he has spoken with government representatives or community organizations from Lakewood, Jefferson County, Wheat Ridge, Pueblo, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins, among other communities, who are interested in learning more about STAR.



>Aurora launched its program, the Aurora Mobile Response Team, on Sept. 8 after hearing demands from protesters and seeing STAR‚Äôs success in Denver, program manager Courtney Tassin said.


>The response team includes one clinician from the Aurora Mental Health Center and one paramedic from Falck Ambulance and operates from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday in the city‚Äôs District 1, which covers the northwest corner of the city.


>In the first four months, the team responded to 190 calls serving a broad variety of needs and people.


>‚ÄúWe have people who are experiencing homelessness and people who are business executives we‚Äôve been serving,‚Äù Tassin said. ‚ÄúMental health doesn‚Äôt discriminate.‚Äù


>Aurora police on 50 occasions have called the team to incidents that they believed would be better served by AMRT, Tassin said.

"Everyone in the comments as well as the article itself seems to be very mistaken as to the root cause of the problem. The problem is not the money.....the problem is two totally different issues.  

1)  The liberal authoritarian government has gone WAY too far and overstepped in what they are asking the police to do... and any decent human would no longer WANT to be a cop when the government is ORDERING them to do unconstitutional things.  The only people still trying to be a cop are the people who have no qualms abusing you for a check 

2) The second reason is something that has been a problem since the 80's, but has only gotten worse in the years from Obama till now. We went from a world where the cops in the movies were the good guys to EVERY cop being an oppressive racist abuser.   Even shows that used to be about being reasonable and rational have shifted gears into ultra-woke mode in a contest to gain social points. Problem is.... nobody likes it and dozens of franchises and companies have shot themselves in the foot by doing so.

"stop saying acab and circlejerking about how bad the police are is a good start. They're workers like you and me. Show some of that good ol' fashioned lefty solidarity in the meantime while we unfuck some of our laws. Oh and following lawful orders is a good practice as well. It shocks me how many white people talk about how scared they supposedly are of the police meanwhile I'm black and have never had a bad interaction with the police. Why? Because I act like an adult and show some respect, and they respect me back. Hell, last month I was pulled over at night with expired tags, a taillight, and license plate light out, with a (legal) gun in the car and got flagged. I pulled into a well lit area, greeted the officer and declared my weapon and told him he could remove it from the vehicle if it made him feel safer. He did, and I walked away without a ticket.

Cops don‚Äôt make minimum wage, never have, never will and even with record low support nationally, they are still more supported than any fast food worker has been.

"‚ÄúPolice by statute have a duty to carry it out.‚Äù

That‚Äôs exactly the problem. There should be some small number of people who have the duty you describe, but they should be a different group of people than those doing traffic stops or robbery investigations, etc. the reality that is that the person stopping someone for rolling a red light does not need a gun. The fact that they have one automatically escalates into a high stress and unpredictable situation. The whole system needs to be torn down and rebuilt with totally different people and ideas, because the system now is broken and does not serve the people.

"It would be a somewhat dangerous job. They would be trained in deescalation tactics to try and deal with the person including methods of restraint. They may have to deal with a violent person on occasion but they would have the option to retreat and wait for assistance. The fact is a cashier at McDonald‚Äôs also may come in contact with a violent or unstable person, and we do not arm them with guns because situations might turn dangerous. There should be a special u it of law enforcement that does have firearms as a very last resort, like a swat team. But the person pulling me over for speeding or responding to a vandalism call should not have a firearm, and they should probably have different jobs than one another. There is no reason that traffic enforcement professionals also need to be theft prevention professionals or domestic violence professionals. They can be separate jobs with separate training so that they are more effective and prepared to handle their roles.

Mortgage and rent caps: cannot exceed one third of the average take home in the bank wage of the county the property is in.

Tax for non-resident or local building and expansion. 

Tax on multiple property ownership that increases based on the number of excess properties owned. Incentive and tax breaks for sales to first time homeowners who move forward to hold that property for a time of at least five years.

People have the right to peacefully protest. The cops have the right to brutally destroy a peaceful first aid station. When we don't allow anyone the rights that were god given everyone suffers. Most cops are decent enough but there's some who take advantage of the power given them. Which turns the  people against them. So now the decent cops all leave because nobody respects them. Making complaints against the bad ones does nothing but give a reason to mess with person who made complaint.

- Retribution - Get the judgment, then write it off and send your client a 1099-C - The landlord will never see a dollar of it, but then your client is on the hook with the IRS for income taxes on the written-off / forgiven debt.

"I‚Äôve never seen so many undercover cop cars like in avl. 
It‚Äôs the police philosophy of trying to ‚Äúget you‚Äù instead of helping the community.

That‚Äôs a very southern dukes of hazards style policing that brings in the bad vibes.

Police join the force to help catch criminals. And they see this via tv shows doing detective work.
To later join the force and it‚Äôs hiding behind a tree on the highway to catch unsuspecting soccer mom speeding 15mph over limit.

And add the racial segregation/redlining and u get blm protests.

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Ä¶ there IS more crime in black areas. But at the same time police know this and do that aforementioned thing to ‚Äúget you‚Äù and grab a 17yr old smoking weed who now gets record. And gets into a fight at 22 and bam‚Ä¶ we get our new grad  from the prison college system committing worse crimes.

So police cannot do much. They have to police areas with more crime so they can help more. But by doing so create a self fulfilling prophecy of revolving door prison grads.

Conservatives look from outside and just see black=crime and support police.
Ergo police like conservatives. Who like status quo. 

But how about changing police tactics.
How about creating better rehab at prisons.
If there‚Äôs for profit prisons maybe this should be a mark as to a solution for Paying them. Less return rate. 

Avl police should go to nyc, LA, SF, Miami and hire minorities there because most likely they are not getting paid enough to live in those cities. Pay relocation. 
We get a more minority police force. 

And work with local jails and prisons for rehab programs. Teach em how to code. Etc.

And do actual detective work. My wife car was broken into by a young hippie looking couple who went around ingles getting cash back w her credit card. 
Ingles had security cams. They had images. We knew it‚Äôs only ingles but nothing. Between avl police and woodfin police etc they just said meh, 
Banks will return u that, we have a report. 
Done. Move on.
To later watch csi on tv doing some amazing stuff to locate Criminals. Like wtf didn‚Äôt avl police do half of that. 
Even a sting operation since we where not the only one. Nope nothing.

"It would be nice to see the TDA $ generated to be funneled back into housing and other lower income infrastructure areas to offset the lack of a living viable wage in the Asheville area.

Not sure what it would take to get the TDA reset to be financially supportive of the area it is trying to attract business to, but I would think that would be a damn good start with an entity that has deep pockets.

"Based on that definition (""representing the people"") yes, but both more literally and in practice, I think it's a mistake to conflate populism as it is often being described and practiced in the U.S. today, with the general norms of liberal democracy.  

In practice, populism seems to have become associated with a political style where, first, a figure pits his or herself, their group, party (and by extension, their followers), against a vaguely defined group of ‚Äúelites.‚Äù 

In left-wing versions, the elites are usually the upper class, corporations, ""the establishment,"" etc.; and among the right-wing, the elites are usually cultural elites, intellectuals, liberal cosmopolitans, and also sometimes corporations.  

After defining a group of elites as the ""bad guys,"" the populist convinces his followers that these elites are the cause of all their problems and may be selling them out to some undeserving, unpopular minority or other group, or essentially stealing from them, or denying a better life to them in order to enrich themselves. 

Where it gets interesting, is that from there, the populist may go on to attack mainstream ""democratic"" institutions (courts, legislatures, bureaucracy, and even elections themselves), arguing that he/she/they alone represent the true will of the people, and that their opponents have been corrupted by elites and must be overcome in order to carry out the people's will. In this way, populist leaders or populism in general can veer into dictatorship / autocracy, by discrediting or attempting to destroy the institutions and groups that can check their power.",t2_1k4xlw4h,MelodicCheese,0,1648227296.0,0,t1_i2340mc,i2340mc,False,4Nails,t3_tnl2qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/tnl2qz/madison_cawthorn_committed_the_one_unforgivable/,Madison Cawthorn Committed the One Unforgivable Sin of Politics,/r/asheville/comments/tnl2qz/madison_cawthorn_committed_the_one_unforgivable/i2340mc/,3,r/asheville,0,3

It sounds like he has some serious, deep seated problems. You sound like you want someone who wants to be with you, which is what you deserve. I think it's going to be a long, and maybe impossible road to get him out of whatever funk he's in.

I think he understands what you're saying when you tell him you're unhappy. You've put 2 years into a relationship that seems to make you miserable.

Many of these folks have felonies, and that makes it incredibly difficult, and often impossible, to get approved for a rental.

"I would definitely let someone live here for free if they took care of my dogs for an extended period. In this situation, I could see maybe charging a very low amount, say $500 a month, in exchange, but people do this because they can. They know someone is desperate or stupid enough to go for it.

I wonder though, what a typical rate would be for a couple months rental on an Airbnb. It might not be more than this, depending on location. Off to the Internet for answers!

Edit/update: quick search shows monthly rents via Airbnb for a 3 bedroom ranging from a couple that are under $2000 up to 15k. Average is $6500. So if you wanted to spend a couple months in Asheville and needed a three bedroom, this would actually be a pretty good deal.

"Reading this feels like hearing from my past self when I was with my ex. My heart goes out to you. I wish I had left my ex years before he dumped me. There was a lot of manipulation on his part that I'm still working through over five years later. 

A lot of folks here are telling you to cut and run, which is my gut feeling as well. However, I know it's not all that simple. 

Here are some important things to evaluate. What DOES he do for you? Is anything in this relationship on your terms? Is it aligned with any of your personal goals, outside of marriage and kids? Does he take responsibility for any of his actions, either in this relationship or his previous one? Is he willing to compromise in any way on the intimacy (for example, taking time to cuddle while watching a movie or talking about your day, if he's not up for sex)? Is he open to therapy- individual or couples?

Ignoring or avoiding someone you are in a relationship with is really disrespectful. It can be a manipulation tactic. It's not ok to be in a relationship where your partner never prioritizes you or your needs. I think you should think critically, and maybe talk with a friend who knows your situation, to evaluate whether his words (that he loves you and wants a marriage and kids) stack up to his actions.
Set some boundaries and expectations and tell him what those are, and that you'll leave if he can't work on those in a reasonable timeframe. Give him some reasonable amount of time, but decide what it is beforehand and put that date in your calendar. Did he agree to find a therapist and 6 weeks have passed, but he hasn't sent any requests or scheduled any appointments? Be prepared for him not to follow through, and make a plan for leaving him. 

Best of luck. My heart hurts for you. Fwiw I recommend that you seek therapy as well, if you're not already doing that.",t2_j64ic,bootsforever,0,1648209982.0,0,t1_i21zsxt,i21zsxt,True,Due-Resolve2114,t3_tn7i3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/tn7i3g/what_do_i_do_i_feel_so_alone_in_my_relationship/,"What do I do, I feel so alone in my relationship?",/r/asheville/comments/tn7i3g/what_do_i_do_i_feel_so_alone_in_my_relationship/i21zsxt/,1,r/asheville,0,1

"> I need to figure out how to tell him in a way that he‚Äôll understand how unhappy I am


You do that by breaking up with him, moving on, and living a happy life with someone whose *actions* say he wants to be married to and have kids with you. Because he actually marries and has kids with you. 

> because the way I‚Äôve been explaining, he‚Äôs just not comprehending


Bullshit. He ‚Äúcomprehends‚Äù perfectly well. He just doesn‚Äôt *care*. Because he doesn‚Äôt have to care. Because you‚Äôve demonstrated that he can tell you whatever you want to hear in the moment, not follow through on any of those promises in the long term, and you‚Äôll still stick around regardless.

I know what you‚Äôre asking. You‚Äôre hoping one of us will give you some perfect, magical phrasing that will *finally* get through to him and make him want to spend time and have sex and marry and have kids with you, but none of us can do that, because no such magical phrasing exists. Because he doesn‚Äôt want to do any of those things with you or, potentially, with anyone. 

> I refuse to continue in a one sided relationship. 


This is also bullshit, because you have continued in a one sided relationship.  And you wonder why he hasn‚Äôt changed when you‚Äôve accepted the status quo for four years? He hasn‚Äôt changed because he doesn‚Äôt have to change. And the reality is that you can‚Äôt make him change. You, however, *can* choose to make a change for yourself, and put some actions behind *your* words, and actually, finally ‚Äúrefuse to continue in a one sided relationship‚Äù.

If ‚Äúhis actions say he wants to live alone in a van down by the river‚Äù, then you should cut him loose so he can go live alone in a van down by the river. And you‚Äôll also be cutting yourself loose and giving yourself the opportunity to find a partner who shares your values and goals, like wanting to get married and have kids, and who actually wants to sleep with and spend time with you. 

The unknown is no doubt a scary proposition, because there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôll find such a person.

"I moved here 7 years ago in 2015 and from what I can tell from what everyone was saying at the time, it was right when costs were going up.

"Yeah.. it didn‚Äôt work in California. A huge fiasco. 
High speed rail for inner city which some people ‚Äúmight‚Äù use it is way too expensive in the USA and filled w politics/nonsese/land rights/etc.

It‚Äôll only work in already very dense areas like north east corridor. And a place to solve congestion. 

But cities in the south where mostly build around cars, and therefore even if u get to Raleigh from Charlotte U are going to need a car. 

So the idea of self driving cars is to replace planes. PLANES!!!! Not trains. But planes!!!

That‚Äôs my point. Trains are just way to impractical and expensive so that ship has sailed for anywhere else except that northeastern corridor. 


Eventually these self driving cars will be just a living room. Hang out there for 3 hours and get to Atlanta. 
Right now it has issues, but the same was with the first iPhone vs now. 

For Asheville I think we should do the opposite. Have it like in Switzerland where it‚Äôs more of a tourist thing. Use existing lines and have it be those old steam engines. (Less smoke)Where the point is being in it‚Ä¶ not getting somewhere. Enjoying the ride. Like crabby.

">‚ÄúUpon the death of any person resulting from violence, poisoning, accident, suicide, or homicide; occurring suddenly when the deceased had been in apparent good health ***or when unattended by a physician***; occurring in a jail, prison, correctional institute, or in police custody; or occurring under any suspicious, unusual or unnatural circumstance, the medical examiner of the county in which the deceased is found shall be notified‚Ä¶‚Äù

>N.C. General Statutes ¬ß 130A-383

""Unattended death"" refers to a death that was not attended by medical personnel. Emergency services here use the term ""unwitnessed"" more frequently, to refer to a death that was not witnessed by anyone. The amount of time deceased has nothing to do with either.

"The future of transportation in the south is self driving cars. Not trains.

So many folks in avl go to Atlanta, Nashville etc for the weekend and even to work. 3hr-5hr drive is almost as much as a plane ride if u count security/check in time. A lot more if it‚Äôs having t go to a hub first.

Self driving cars in southern highways is a match made in heaven. Clean, ample and big highways.

It‚Äôs not going to be cheap of course. Just like trains when they first arrived. But eventually prices will come down.

- must be vegan, no meat in the house whatsoever
- must stay quiet at all times! (he would always wear these big blue earmuffs whenever he blended up in his Vitamix. Then he would forget he was wearing them still and proceed to yell at us)
- all must respect his golden retriever, Chakra (I would feed her clandestine meat snacks regularly on the DL)
- Jeff was not allowed to play his fiddle in the house as it ruined the 'vibe'
- everyone should be like Carlos, the penultimate and quietest roommate. He eventually bought his own house in black mtn, Dios lo bendiga.
