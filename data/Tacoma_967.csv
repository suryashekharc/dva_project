I‚Äôve dealt with a lot of these groups/ homes like this. A lot of Christian groups that are actually willing to take someone in are like this. So it‚Äôs a give and take. Most churches would just give your family member a sandwhich but would not want to share pew with him let alone a living space. I‚Äôd say the only red flag I see is setting up a business. All it takes is an application fee to set up a business and I‚Äôve seen more than one homeless person with an LLC. So if your family member expressed they wanted to start a business they might just be offering support. My concern would be if they are asking them to set up businesses. That is a huge red flag and the only time I‚Äôve ever seen that is when someone wants to do something shady.,t2_4p2s9ok9,CooldudePNW,0,1648267010.0,0,t1_i25l1pf,i25l1pf,True,kai7yak,t3_toa0nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/toa0nv/a_place_of_restoration/,A Place of Restoration?,/r/Tacoma/comments/toa0nv/a_place_of_restoration/i25l1pf/,2,r/Tacoma,0,2

"I'm not sure you do since there's actually no disagreement over which direction the overton window has moved.  But you didn't want to go there, so i'll just move on.

Perhaps, trouble is we're actually calling spades spades here, where previous work by the other side calling us socialists/communists is just bad faith scare mongering, since very little policy in the USofA can be considered truly socialist/communist.

And your language is a perfect example of what i'm talking about.  We had what can only be described as a belligerent autocrat as president for 4 years who encouraged white supremacy at every opportunity and inflamed actual race wars by saying there were good people on both sides when there were literal neo nazis on one side. Mean while you're dithering about possibility misinforming people about the extent of the danger by calling wolf.

I completely agree, politics does happen on an individual level.  However there is a bigger picture to look at and be informed by and i think more people should take into account this perspective.

 Trust me, I am aware of the impact an individual can have on a community. In fact it is an extremely rare case where an individual make a national impact; Even people like Greta Thunberg who have a huge international reach and speaks to the most powerful people in the world on the biggest stages seem to barely move the needle in the direction they want. So yes, if one is going to have an impact on the world it will be by helping neighbors and friends to build an impregnable safety net that ensures every ones needs are taken care of.

Obviously there is nothing there that states calling for vigilante violence is wrong or violates sub rules. I didn't know it was against the rules here in reading through any of the rules. I would have been reporting those all along had I known there was a rule against it, as rule one is vague at best on anything regarding violence.  


If you read through the comments on this post, you will see a segment of folks who state they rarely visit or interact on this sub because of the existing climate of  violent posts.  


I personally don't think it would hurt anything to add a caveat either to an existing rule to clarify calls for vigilante justice and other violence is against the rules, or just make a rule on its own.

I will begin reporting the violence posts. But I feel some would just be naturally averted by clarifying the subs position clearly in the rules, using the word 'violence' to make sure there is no ambivalence.

How would stricter gun laws have prevented these kids from getting guns? They aren‚Äôt of legal age to purchase a gun, and I have no doubt that the guns contained magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, simply because the standard on most guns is 12-19 rounds. 



The bottom line is that enforcement of existing gun laws would have prevented this. I‚Äôll give you an example. Last month some guys were in my yard digging up my grass and wouldn‚Äôt leave. They were looking for a gun that was supposedly stashed there. I told them to leave multiple times but they wouldn‚Äôt. All I could do was stay inside, call the police, and have a shotgun nearby just in case. The police didn‚Äôt show up FOR THREE FUCKING HOURS. I don‚Äôt know if they found their gun, but if they did I bet it has been or will be used in a crime.

"It's looking a bit up in the air right now if it's the one group of four 11-16 year olds, and another pair of the 15/16 year olds. 

Hopefully it is just the same kids and not some widespread trend. I shutter to think of the implications if two groups of kids decided separately to each go and commit crimes of this nature. 

I totally agree the repeat offender issue is getting much worse, there's little doubt that it's a handful of people with very long rap sheets that are committing crimes again and again. Even when they are arrested, they tend to be out within a day or two. Sometimes literally within hours of being booked.

"> I agree that a lot of stories lately have been crime focused are you saying in your vision this sub would be news free? Crime posts free?

Not at all. I support all the news and reports of crimes because we all need to know about what is happening in our community.  


The issues lie with the comments that arise from these posts, not the posts themselves. Calling for killing, assaulting, torturing, maiming and other means of harm on people for things like shoplifting seems disturbing, excessive, and as someone else posted in this thread, seems to be against site rules.  


Another person posted how commentary like that keeps them off of this sub and avoiding posts that might include such comments. I think that person should feel comfortable looking at all posts on this sub without having to see someone stating they'd like to inflict something awful and violent, even on the most misdemeanor of offenses.  


I'm not comfortable seeing that. And some people would act on such feelings and words. I do not feel this sub should be a place that enables it.

"[Edited after part of my post got lost] 

As a friend of survivors who violently, torturously lost their loved one when he committed a theft; I can attest that torture and murder punish other people as well. When a criminal is tortured and murdered, it is ineffectual for solving any problem. It's putting out the fire with gasoline. Furthermore, the victims end up being the loved ones who survive. They are the ones who feel the lasting loss and grief. They are truly the ones who endure the punishment. Criminals are all someone's children. Sometimes they are friends, siblings, parents, family. We all start out as innocent babies and children who just want to be loved and live fulfilling lives.

PSA: Addiction is a disease. Treat the cause (addiction) to get rid of the symptoms (desperate/criminal behavior).

2. Zero anticipated upkeep. There is no cleaning, no maintenance work. 2 year warranty from the installer. They are expected to last 20 years. The energy captured goes down 1% to 5% annually (estimated).
3. No batteries on premises. I was never going to get away from the TPU connection and with net metering so there wasn't any benefit with having batteries. TPU just acts like a giant battery - I fill it during the day and I pull out of it at night.  - Edit on the Battery - Batteries don't make much sense in Tacoma because there is one constant price and the purchase/sale price is the same as well. If you were selling to TPU at $.05/kWh and buying at $.10, then a battery makes perfect sense. Or if it electricity was cheaper at different times of days, like in most of California, then yeah, maximize your storage. But in Tacoma, its all the same price / same buy back.

"Hold on to your butts. Wall of text coming. I just put panels on my roof in Feb so I've done a crap ton of research.

My estimated pay back on the initial quote was 12-15 years - depending upon how much I estimated electricity costs going up. Tacoma's electrical costs are relatively cheap so there isn't a quick immediate pay back.

Tacoma doesn't have great sun situation like CA or FL or Texas. However, we also have incredibly long summers with tons of sun.

Most installers are going to recommend you put panels on to cover about 85% of your usage on an annual basis. That is because TPU is a net metering - if you over produce you won't be paid for it. I ended up going with DOUBLE the size of install. My plan is get two electric vehicles, an electric mini-split and an electric water heater. I expect my payback to be bigger with doubling the size of panels, but it is a bigger loan and bigger risk. Also, you are locked into Net Metering with TPU for the live of your system. At a future date, TPU could go pay new solar panel systems less for their electricity generated. There has NOT been movement toward this yet. (Also, you won't eliminate your electrical bill entirely because you are getting charged $17.55 monthly for a connection charge).

If you are well insulated, and if you have a gas furnace and gas water heater, you use gas vehicles, you aren't consuming all that much electricity. If you have already started the conversion, then you  are consuming a bit more.

From an environmental point of view, its great. But not actually a massive ""Carbon Offset"". TPU is already 93-to 97% carbon neutral so you aren't going to pull carbon out of the air, unless you going to be driving an electric vehicle.

Things to think about:

How new is your roof - do you need to replace it in the near future? My installer estimated $2k to pull off panels and put them back on when we redid the roof in a couple years. Its easier if you can do it all at once.

Is the roof south facing? Or west facing. Ideally, its south facing as you'll get more sun in the winter. Do you have trees or other issues that will restrict the direct sun on the panels?

Do you want to get an electric vehicle? You can get ""free gas"". But city electricity is so cheap that's I estimate our fuel when our Leaf's arrive we'll be paying $15/month if we were paying city rates.

Home Value. All the conversations we had with real estate agents - several - they indicated there is no increase in purchase price. The majority of people aren't going to spend more money on panels so its not going to be there as part of your sales value. At least, not right now. If TPU were to double the cost of electricity, or if gas prices go to $10/gal that could change.

"Actually this is a Reddit-wide content policy rule that is simply not being enforced, perhaps because the moderators are not aware of it, or because it is so rampant at this point that it will be a necessary and ongoing campaign to root it out

https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151

>Rule 1: Remember the human. ‚Ä¶ Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence.

>**""Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual** (including oneself) or a group of people; likewise, do not post content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. We understand there are sometimes reasons to post violent content (e.g., educational, newsworthy, artistic, satire, documentary, etc.) so if you‚Äôre going to post something violent in nature that does not violate these terms, ensure you provide context to the viewer so the reason for posting is clear.

Friendly reminder that Reddit is a privately held organization and is not the government and therefore the [first amendment does not supersede the content policy](https://xkcd.com/1357/)

Questions regarding the content policy need to be referred to the admins, and AEO

A good way to get a sub quarantined or banned is for the members and users to prolifically report violence (or any content policy and fraction), and for the moderators to dismiss those, which then creates a notification for the admins to review. **You (anyone) can also individually report a failure of a moderator to take action on a reply or post by sending a modmail to r/modsupport with a link to the content, what was reported, and after a reasonable time, if any action was taken.** This can cause moderator accounts to be suspended, and if the other moderators persist then eventually the entire sub can be quarantined or banned. It is no one's interest to not follow the content policy.

Additionally there are methods that moderators can employ to reduce comments of violence and rampant reports and threads being hijacked; weekly or daily politics/homelessness/crime posts and/or creating chat rooms on specific subjects which are linked in the menu tab, post flares about specific topics, locking posts or comment threads, active moderator participation on sensitive topics, AMAs with community members who specialize in a facet that deals with one of the hot button subjects, etc.",t2_4f71qkjs,SoThenIThought_,0,1648237410.0,0,t1_i23tg5i,i23tg5i,False,LadyDiscoPants,t3_tnw2sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tnw2sm/how_about_a_new_sub_rule_no_calls_for_violence_in/,"How about a new sub rule?

"I understand that, and don't necessarily disagree; possibly with an exception of the direction the nation's overton window has moved over the past two decades, but that's a bit of a different topic that I don't have much interest in opening up.

What I don't understand is the benefit of labeling positions that could otherwise be defined as amoral, conservative, or right wing, instead as fascism. Does doing so not help tug at the far right end of end of the overton window by normalizing the word? There's a bit of a ‚Äúboy who cried wolf‚Äù situation going on. If we're going to assign the label of fascism to everything that's right of the far left, what are we going to call actual right wing extremism when it crops up? 

Politics happens at an individual level, and larger movements are only as strong as the people they can attract. People don't necessarily focus on the bigger picture, or mortality when making up their minds about what to support. A lot of it comes from interactions and lived experiences. Quite frankly, ‚Äúwere these people dicks to me?‚Äù seems to play a role in one's personal politics. It shouldn't, but it does.

"Surprised how many people DM me for this. Just for more information, this agent completely shot down another agent I was working with by bringing up a list of the houses he sold in the area compared to his. He pretty much told me not to work with this agent because he sucks at selling houses. I truly wish I stayed with our first guy. He was down to earth and communicated well, unlike the dipshit I hired. 

He is a RE agent that only works M-F until 5pm. Most working class folks like us are busy during those times and only available on the weekends. I had to burn a bunch of pto and sick leave to accommodate his schedule. We missed out on a dream house because the offer review was in a couple of days. He was not available to do a showing and put an offer in. So we fired his bitch ass. To make this worse, he already sold our house. So we were out of a fucking house because this guy couldn't help his client that he just earned commission from. 

To make this worst, we had a budget and conditions for the house we would buy. He kept sending us houses that were way above what we wanted to afford. And our conditions were rarely met. The house search was completely useless with this guy and we ended up seeing houses on our own, while this guy was still our agent. 

There's a bunch of shit this guy did that doesn't seem to be in the best interest of the buyers or sellers. He is super pushy and puts extreme pressure on you. The agent we ended up using was the complete opposite. Communicated well, available for showings and accommodated our busy schedule. He used to be a Redfin agent.

"Political issues IMO have a very cut and dried morality.  Pollute the environment or don't.  Treat every human being with dignity or don't.  Every human deserves food/water/shelter, or not. etc.  Any argument that a moderate makes for not 100% the obviously moral and correct thing, provides shelter for the people who want ""or not"".

So I encourage you to stop looking at/thinking about this problem on an individual/micro level and look at it from a macro/systemic level.

"From article:

Authorities have arrested four boys, ages 11, 12, 14 and 16, who are suspected of committing a drive-by shooting on Interstate 5 in Tacoma on Sunday.

The boys were booked into the Remann Hall juvenile detention center Thursday for investigation of first-degree assault and drive-by shooting, the Washington State Patrol said in a news release.

The shooting occurred about 4:40 p.m. on the ramp from northbound I-5 to eastbound 38th Street. The driver of a Toyota 4Runner told troopers a maroon van cut him off, prompting him to sound his horn. The van slowed, and someone in the front passenger seat fired at least five shots at the Toyota, striking it twice, troopers said.

"Yes, I think during covid there has been a shift in migration of not just about-to-be-homeless or already homeless people towards this region, but also people with drug use issues whom want to continue to use drugs unabated, and people whom want to take advantage of our now very lax property theft enforcement. Sometimes those are three separate people, sometimes they're one. 

I know what activists say on this topic, and there likely is some truth to the majority of people being locals; but even before covid the number of people migrating for better weather, services, or lax enforcement in either drugs or other crime was far from zero. These people still have agency, and can make decisions about their life; and if the west coast seems like a good idea, they'll make efforts to get here. It's really not difficult to load a small amount of possessions into a bag, and either drive out here, or get on a Greyhound.

This isn't some theoretical hypothesis I have, I just helped lift a friend out of homelessness whom decided to come out here instead of stay in Texas when they also have friends and family. Showed up at my doorstep without even $5 to their name. They were attracted here for some of the exact same reasons I'm talking about, if you're going to be homeless anyway, it's a lot better to do it here than Texas.

But TBH, I really don't care to argue the topic that much anymore. I did when I felt invested in this city and wanted it to improve, but at this point? It's a reap who you sow sorta situation, and I just want to be out of here before harvest time. If this is what people out here want, why fight it?

However, I'll repeat this last section, because it's really what the topic boils down to: Hopefully you're correct about the lack of migration (and I seriously mean that). Because if more people have started migrating here to take advantage, and we have no intention of stopping it, this area will eventually be bled dry. 

If I'm wrong, no biggie; we were a just a little firmer than what we needed to be. But if you're wrong about this? That's a deep hole to dig out of.

--edit--

Well, it looks like u/LadyDiscoPants blocked me, so I can't reply to her comment.

However, this is a good example of a major issue surrounding the discussion of homelessness in the PNW. A lot of people cannot look past their bigotry on the topic, and see the situation for what it really is, or is evolving into. I wasn't even disagreeing, just had a slightly different take on the issue, using the same sources presented; yet that challenged existing prejudices, and therefore must be silenced. 

It's the crux of my concern as to why it won't get better here.",t2_84qtm91m,Old2Tacoma,0,1648221100.0,0,t1_i22o1cj,i22o1cj,False,SnooPets356,t3_tkhoim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tkhoim/40th_and_pac_ave_abandoned_vehicleshomeless/,40th and Pac Ave Abandoned Vehicles/Homeless Encampment,/r/Tacoma/comments/tkhoim/40th_and_pac_ave_abandoned_vehicleshomeless/i22o1cj/,1,r/Tacoma,0,1

"I'm a little bias on the issue, because I've been a cop, and had a ton of training with the handgun. I've also heard a lot of reservation from people in regards to carrying their own handgun.

I've heard people are usually afraid to hurt/kill someone when the moment calls for it. However, when I ask parents if they would kill to defend their children, they are certain they would. Handguns, when used in defense of your life, is to protect yourself, and the myriads of webs of relationships you have.   
It is to avoid the future where your parents, your spouse, your kids and friends are at your funeral, mourning you because of some criminal. If not for your life, do it for  your family and your friends.  


My second point is more of anecdotal. I've interviewed victims of violent crimes; assault, robbery, rape, and homicide. While I've never asked this question, most were not armed with a handgun.

"Yes you may. I appreciate that part because strangely it feels like a personal question.

I wasn't able to put my finger on it at first. We hunt, and I'm a great shot and perfectly comfortable handling my shotgun and rifles so I kind of had to think about it. What it comes down to for me is two things.

One is my fear that I'll need to use it. I know that doesn't make sense, but somehow the thought of carrying a gun makes that more real in my head.

Two is that is I did need to use it, I would have used it. I'm so overly empathetic it's ridiculous. The thought of someone hurting is painful to me. The thought of inflicting that pain... I can't even.

And when I say that about pain I'm talking about all the emotional pain as well as the physical. Also I don't just mean the person that might need to be shot, but everyone connected to the situation. When someone is killed, there's just about always going to be someone who mourns and the thought of being part of the cause is really difficult.

So I'm getting the permit. I'll get a gun. I'll do classes and practice to make sure I'm good with it (handguns are very different from long guns!). Reason one is easy to overcome.

""However, no climate is suited for living unsheltered. They all come with grave risks. The summer heat of Los Angeles can easily lead to heat stroke. The heat in Phoenix, Arizona‚Äîninth on the list for highest rates of homelessness‚Äîcan kill quickly. There are many moderate and warm climates around the U.S., such as the South and Southeast, which don‚Äôt struggle with nearly the same amount of homelessness.  
  
This myth can also be easily defeated when you consider no one plans to stay homeless long-term. It‚Äôs insulting to people who are homeless to suggest they would move cross-country to better facilitate living outdoors. For homeless people, each day on the street is one too many.""

""This may be the most pervasive myth about homelessness on the West Coast. However‚Äîand this truth is relevant to the first myth as well‚Äîpeople rarely move once they become homeless. When they do, it‚Äôs almost never to seek out social programs.""

""There‚Äôs more homelessness on the West Coast because there‚Äôs more of what causes homelessness: high housing costs and poverty. According to the Out of Reach: The High Cost of Housing 2020, to afford a two-bedroom apartment in California you need to make $36.98 per hour. It holds the second-highest ‚Äúhousing wage‚Äù in the country, under Hawaii. Oregon, Washington, Arizona, and Nevada also hold some of the highest housing wages in the U.S.""

""California has five of the top 20 most-gentrified cities in the U.S. Gentrification is the process of a city pouring renovation and resources into certain areas to make them more appealing to the middle- and upper-class. Poor residents, and their areas of town, get neglected or even pushed out of their housing.

In Seattle‚Äîa West Coast city struggling with the third-highest rate of homelessness in the country‚Äîgovernment funding has gone to building homes geared to the wealthiest tech workers rather than the families making lower, or even average, incomes.

Having spent my adult life in Eastern WA and consequently a great deal of time along the Palouse and Snake River, if you haven‚Äôt been here to see the terrain, you‚Äôve got zero concept of enormous amount of roads, rail and infrastructure it would take to ship equivalent amount of food products to the world if those dams are removed. 

It would take dozens of bridges to be built, hundreds of miles of expanded highway and dozens of trucks to replace a single barge full of grain traveling on 2-lane highways to even begin to match the barge capacity.  This of course will have it‚Äôs own environmental impact. 

Not to mention this would absolutely demolish a way of life and reared economic activities that 10‚Äôs of thousands of Idaho and Washington residents have built upon the resources of the river system.

"Straight from Philly on Commerce was my go to until the pandemic economy claimed them.  Go Philly gets a ""meh"" from me for two very fixable reasons:

* Significant differences in the way the meat is prepared between their individual cooks.  The majority of the sandwiches I've had from them have had meat cooked until it was an even grey, chopped super fine, and barely seasoned.  Good but not great.  A few of the sandwiches have been ""proper"" with more coarsely chopped meat,  bits of dark crisp meat scraped from the griddle mixed in and seasoned to salty tangy greasy perfection.  The prospect of getting another one of these is what keeps me going back.
* Limited menu options (pretty much everything is greasy and fried and outside of the chessesteaks decidedly not Philly food related).  Having any sort of orderable vegetable  (even simple shredded lettuce and tomato for a cheesesteak hoagie option) beyond pickled peppers would go a long way.  Expanding to have some sort of ""not fried"" hoagie or grinder options would be a great add as well.",t2_1475f352,WhooperMan,0,1648163520.0,0,t1_i1zuo67,i1zuo67,True,drewg4136,t3_tn67ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tn67ja/go_philly/,Go Philly,/r/Tacoma/comments/tn67ja/go_philly/i1zuo67/,4,r/Tacoma,0,4

"Thanks for sharing! Exciting addition for sure. Dusty's and Zodiac are such cool spots -- having their touch at The Pine Cone will be fun for all.

Some additional details about the menu and updates from the story:

>The giant menu of 100-plus dishes will be whittled down to a more manageable level for a modern restaurant, but Dana Verellen promises the classics will remain: chicken-fried steak, hash browns, eggs in various styles.  
>  
>Expect more from-scratch cooking and contemporary brunch dishes ‚Äî perhaps scalloped potatoes in a cast iron pan, fancy toasts, something resonant of a benedict but not dripping in hollandaise. Similar to Dusty‚Äôs, where all-day breakfast is a real and delicious thing, The Pine Cone will serve breakfast, brunch and lunch dishes until 9 p.m., likely alongside nightly specials. Verellen especially loved the Sunday Thanksgiving plate.  
>  
>They have ripped out the carpet, installing new floors and walls, plus a bigger refrigerator in the back. The lunch counter will stay, as will the pine-green booths. It will look different to longtimers, she admitted, but they intend to stay true to its decades-old heart.  
>  
>Perhaps the biggest difference will be the liquor license: daytime drinks with Verellen‚Äôs signature unpretentious style. ‚ÄúMore straightforward but still using fun ingredients. Light drinks is kind of where I‚Äôm going.‚Äù  
>  
>No slushies, for now anyhow!

"I could believe those numbers in 2018, we didn't have policies towards homelessness, or drug laws that were radically different then the rest of the country at that point. There wasn't nearly as much of a visible unsheltered homelessness problem during that time either. Hell, I still liked this city & state in 2018. 

But things have changed since then. The Martin V. Boise decision went effect in late 2018. Our drug possession laws were totally struck down in 2021, and the new laws are significantly less severe.

">That people don't flock here for free services without the expectation they'll ever improve.   


Nah, most of the unhoused in our area are our own citizens.  People aren't 'flocking' here for services. People are flocking out on to the street from Tacoma homes and surrounding towns.  


These are OUR neighbors who we reject once they fall below a certain economic standard.

""But available evidence shows that most people without housing don't travel great distances. Over two-thirds of homeless people surveyed by L.A. Homeless Services Authority in 2019 said they‚Äôd been in the county for more than a decade before becoming homeless, compared to only 18.8 percent who said they were most recently housed out of state. In San Francisco, 43 percent of homeless people said they‚Äôd lived in the city for over 10 years, while 70 percent said they lived indoors in the city before becoming homeless. (Some of the remaining 30 percent may have lived in nearby Bay Area cities.) **In a 2018 survey, 83.1 percent of homeless folks in King County said they‚Äôd been living indoors there before being forced outdoors.**"" [https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvg7ba/instead-of-helping-homeless-people-cities-are-bussing-them-out-of-town](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvg7ba/instead-of-helping-homeless-people-cities-are-bussing-them-out-of-town)",t2_95i54768,LadyDiscoPants,0,1648152714.0,0,t1_i1z43gf,i1z43gf,False,SnooPets356,t3_tkhoim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tkhoim/40th_and_pac_ave_abandoned_vehicleshomeless/,40th and Pac Ave Abandoned Vehicles/Homeless Encampment,/r/Tacoma/comments/tkhoim/40th_and_pac_ave_abandoned_vehicleshomeless/i1z43gf/,-1,r/Tacoma,0,-1

"People looking down on the homeless population isn't unique to here. If anything, there is significantly more tolerance compared to most of the rest of the nation for that sort of thing, this is the only place I've ever been where people use terms like ""unhoused"" or ""neighbor"" to describe people living out on the street.

Elsewhere? They're called ""bums""; or ""the homeless""; or just ""hobos""; and it's difficult to pretend that problem isn't less severe in those places. It's not like these are little hick towns either, cities like NYC or Boston are able to compel virtually everyone into shelter, why can't we? 

I genuinely hope there is a light at the end of the tunnel in this region's attempts to enable people out of crime, homelessness, or drug addiction without actually compelling them to do so. That people don't flock here for free services without the expectation they'll ever improve. That tax revenue to fund these programs continues to outpace the demand. If this is the case, then the success story of how the West Coast solved all the problems via compassion can be easily exported. It will be tough to argue with results.

But I don't think that will happen, and I say this as someone who was also homeless: I'm incredibly thankful I did not live here during that time in my life, and was instead in a state that actually maintained expectations of me, and would follow through if I failed to meet those expectations.

"Appreciate the response! Are these public forums with officers a regular occurrence by chance? I'd be interested in attending one of these. 

The only good explanation I've heard is what you've pointed out, that TPD have not been enforcing the law because they are claiming that certain laws (usually I hear it's the new accountability laws that were recently Implemented by the state legislature) are preventing them from doing so. But there is never a clear indication from law enforcement about how exactly they can't enforce the law and what specific laws are preventing them from doing their job. 

None of this makes a lot of sense to me since I've looked into the new accountability laws and they seem pretty straightforward to me; the biggest reforms were about initiating a vehicular pursuit requires probable cause and another one about when you can and can't use a chokehold. None of this adds up to me as these are not changes that would result in rampant crime sprees. Perhaps a slight increase, but 100%+ increase in robbery? It just doesn't add up.

Now I'm not the conspiratorial type, but law enforcement has always appeared to me as a very fraternal institution and my best guess at explaining all this is that law enforcement feel threatened after the whole George Floyd incident and ensuing protests, as well as the verdict. As a result they have decided privately/internally that they are going to ""slow walk"" their duty to enforce the law and publicly they will use the new accountability laws as their we explanation. This approach had two benefits; first being that obviously crime rates will skyrocket like we are seeing now. And secondly, this will change public perception on policing in order to restore the whole ""thin blue line"" narrative as well as create the perception that trying to regulate policing will only lead to rampant crime.

I could be completely off base here and this is absolutely conspiratorial thinking, but it's the only logical explanation I've been able to muster for all this. And this one area where I'd like to see more data regarding law enforcement activities. Things like arrests, bookings, incident reports, etc. What are police doing differently on a day to day basis?

You mentioned you've worked homicide investigations for the past 18 years, are you a detective by chance? Do you know if there are publicly available reports from these investigations? Not shut homicide but investigations in general.

"Here's the thing, I have friends and family all over the nation. Most of us have a bit of wanderlust, and scattered pretty far in adulthood. I still keep up with almost all of these people.

So, when I talk with them, we discuss what's going on locally in the places we live, and naturally I'll bring up the crime, and visible unsheltered homelessness that's everywhere out here. 

Most people I talk to are horrified to hear about what's happening. 

""Wait, your city isn't like this too?"" I'll ask; and the answer is always ""No, not even close."" 

It's not like Tacoma is the odd man out either, all these cities were hit hard by Covid, just like the rest of the nation. Tacoma is roughly in the middle of the pack when it comes to poverty too, some are better, some are worse.

Yet for whatever reason, I am one of outliers having to live with these problems that are plaguing not just Tacoma, but the entire region. The only other people I talk to that need to deal with this also live on the West Coast. I'm frankly down to my last non-local friend out here; everyone else has bailed for elsewhere because they're sick of dealing with these problems not being resolved. ""It's beautiful, but..."" is pretty common way the discussion on why they went back east starts.

It's really difficult at this point for me to lay blame on the same issues that the rest of the nation has dealt with, and not failures of our local government. We're now serving more as warning of what not to do, rather than an example that should be emulated.

I'm starting to believe that the best way to solve this situation for myself is to find somewhere else to live without these existing problems, and spend my time, energy, and money doing everything in my power to ensure that place does not follow the same path Tacoma, and much of the rest of the West Coast has.",t2_84qtm91m,Old2Tacoma,0,1648146556.0,0,t1_i1yoec4,i1yoec4,False,SnooPets356,t3_tkhoim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tkhoim/40th_and_pac_ave_abandoned_vehicleshomeless/,40th and Pac Ave Abandoned Vehicles/Homeless Encampment,/r/Tacoma/comments/tkhoim/40th_and_pac_ave_abandoned_vehicleshomeless/i1yoec4/,1,r/Tacoma,0,1

"That's interesting about that arsonist woman. That's anecdotal though, I was making a generalization that usually people who commit felonies aren't and statistically the majority of criminals  are unemployed. A big reason of that is our society is extremely punitive and does not give ex convicts enough opportunity to reintegrate into society, the prison system is designed to be a revolving door. 

I agree that unemployment rate is not a particularly useful statistic in a vacuum. That said, there are many studies that have shown a correlation between unemployment rate and crime. If you look at total employment numbers and nonfarm employment they are virtually identical to where they were in 2019 before this rise in crime and the pandemic. So to me I think I need more evidence to be convinced that this crime wave is being caused primarily by unemployment or joblessness.

All this said, crime is a lagging indicator of unemployment. That is, reductions in unemployment are usually followed by reductions in crime. So it's possible this crime wave is a fleeting phenomenon and we just haven't seen the effects of unemployment returning to where they were previously.

And don't get me wrong here, I certainly believe that economic pressures factor a great deal into crime rates. But crime is an extraordinarily complex subject in which there are a multitude of factors in play. I'd like to see some additional data, evidence, and research regarding the factors that are causing this current crime wave.",t2_huh8vegi,b0und13ss,0,1648145525.0,0,t1_i1ylrxo,i1ylrxo,False,SnortingElk,t3_tlavw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tlavw9/south_tacoma_is_a_hellhole_business_owners_rip/,"""South Tacoma is a hellhole""; Business owners rip city council over crime spike",/r/Tacoma/comments/tlavw9/south_tacoma_is_a_hellhole_business_owners_rip/i1ylrxo/,0,r/Tacoma,0,0

">screams of hate and prejudice towards people you don't even know.   
  
>  
>I had hope that your comment to mine wouldn't be as your normal comments. 

Not really. I was unhoused once, and I know how a lot of housed people treated me, knowing nothing about my circumstances.   


So...you made a comment that usually gets my attention, yet you hoped I'd behave wildly different than ever before? How'd that go?  


I do not say ALL housed people, but a giant portion either ignored my serious plight, or decided I belonged there through some fault of character. But whenever I even say that, folks like you decide I meant everyone in a house on earth. Look up 'most' 'many' 'a lot of' and tell me that means everyone.  


It's not prejudice . Nor is is hate. It is disgust at a very unnecessary vilification and often erroneous judgments of peoples characters based on nothing more but that someone is unhoused and have to find whatever ways they can to eat, bathe, get water, seasonal appropriate clothing, a place to sleep. Not scattering trash about falls way under those priorities. It is exhausting to even get half those things done when you have 0 resources.   


It is disgust at a prevalent hatred in this community that I personally experienced, and witness almost daily on this sub. It's the same shit your types used to say about me and to me. I get to answer back to you all now that I own a home and you can't kick me down anymore.  


  
If you choose to think I hate you for calling out your obvious bias then run with it like the 'usual downvoters of my shenanigan's'. Folks whose ego's and dislike of being called out on prejudice overrides their basic human decency and kindness towards people far less fortunate. Most people take it personal just like you, and then go on to continue their bias, and add me to the list lol.

"My thoughts align with what you have expressed.

Not data but my recent experiences re police are when a woman was victim to a hit and run outside the Tacoma Safe event (she was walking on the sidewalk handing out leaflets against homeless sweeps) the policeman was indifferent to collecting and evidence such as the side mirror that ripped off his car or the eye witness videos. No interest. Until the mayor found out. Now they're all over it but that moment has passed.

When neighbors met with officers to ask about addressing specific crimes in our neighborhood they said: well, see, laws have changed so we can't do anything blame the legislature. We have several people in the legal field who identified the difference between PC and RS and officer changed course to you know Boise ruling prevents us from keeping people off the street. We reminded him we weren't asking for sweeps and that wasn't our issue and we kept having to remind him that the automated ""hands-tied"" responses were not applicable to our requests for help.

"What you're missing is that Neo-nazis overthrew the government in a violent coup in 2014, with the help of the US government. Since then, they have exacted a violent genocide against Roma people. The regions of Ukraine which are made up of primarily ethnically Romani voted to leave Ukraine. It is the Bandarites who brought back that phrase, installed fascist leaders into the government, had them pass laws outlawing speaking Russian or exhibiting aspects of Russian culture, and then formed a Nazi army to go down and kill the Roma people who lived in Donbas.

Some cars don‚Äôt even have chokes, but old vw bugs certainly are carbureted and certainly can take five to ten minutes on a cold morning before they‚Äôre driveable. This does not sound like the entire reason this guy was out there if he was, as you say, doing donuts and revving for an hour. No car needs an hour to get up to temperature, choke or no choke.

2. ‚ÄúOh they could have stabbed or shot me if I confronted them‚Äù yes, true. But if you don‚Äôt ask them nicely, the chance of that goes way up. There‚Äôs more chance you‚Äôd get hit by a drunk driver or randomly stabbed by someone who specifically doesn‚Äôt like you for one reason or another than the chance you‚Äôd politely ask them to stop and they‚Äôd actually stab you. Stop being such a worry wort and talk to people. It may help you realize that the whole world isn‚Äôt out to get you, and there are other reasons other than ruining your day that people are making noise at 5am.

3. If you were upset, your neighbors were also upset. You could have gone around to four or five neighbors doors during this hour and said hey I‚Äôm going to tell this vw guy to leave, if he shoots me call the cops and get me an ambulance‚Äù and then you can actually have a nice conversation without getting scared.

People don‚Äôt come back to parking lots they feel they‚Äôll get in trouble at. You need to stick up for yourself.

All the people telling you to shoot out his windows or throw a Molotov at him or otherwise be violent are sad cowards that can‚Äôt us their words to fix problems.
Don‚Äôt be like them.

"I agree that being able to escape the heat and have a form of entertainment is good. To feel like they have a place of safety even while homeless is good. To feel as 'normal' as possible. 

But I have to disagree when it comes to not having ruined it. They scattered the parts they didn't want from the cars. The trash that isn't piled in one spot it scattered and littering the land. You see it waterfalling down hills. You see it strewn alongside roads. 

Though, again I agree with you that there needs to be some form of access to being able to get rid of their trash just as one would with a house. Dumpsters here and there near larger encampments might help. There is one near the freeway ramp that has a little community there and I think a dumpster or two, hell even a portapotty would be nice but even more unlikely, would be helpful. These are people, we all know, and yes the city has failed but to see it as those voicing frustration at the situation as hate or prejudice right away is a bit of a stretch for some. If not a bit of hate and prejudice unto itself. 

This reply to my comment speaks.. screams of hate and prejudice towards people you don't even know. How people are living and doing on their own. Which is funny since it's in defense of the very thing. 

I had hope that your comment to mine wouldn't be as your normal comments. The ones people downvote to shenanigans. I don't know if it's just a passion to defend people who are in trouble, but the hate and preconceived opinions that come out just show the hate and prejudice you have for others in the community that don't think exactly like you. 

Do I wish I could help people? Do I wish the city would help people? Do I wish people would stop voting in people that cheat and swindle people of the city? Do I wish there was a bit more pride taken by everyone of this city, housed and not, about the environment. Hell yes. 

But I am barely holding on to what I have myself. Heck. I can barely move physically because of the hate and prejudice thrown at me and lack of help provided because of it. So, go on, hate me. Think everyone who says something different are just hateful boomers that ride around on the backs of their 'inferiors'.

"I'm arguing that the OP, by saying phrases like that and by normalizing that thinking, imply that nothing is being done to curb crime. When in fact, stuff is being done to ENCOURAGE CRIME instead.

We need to stop looking to our politicians to provide ways to stop crime and instead expect them to stop passing laws which create criminals.

To put it another way, this is just like climate change. We see things happen like 110F days in Western Washington and we ask our politicians to pass single use plastic bans for bags & utensils ... Meanwhile they are handing out drilling permits, allowing refineries to be built, and permitting bottled water plants.

">Wonder if they'll have the batteries and tv and AC like they did last couple summers.

I hope so. Because living on the street is hell, and whatever comfort they can jimmy together for themselves in extreme poverty most of us cannot imagine, I for one am happy to know of.

Last summer unhoused people died from heat exposure. I am glad those folks you describe were able to make some kind of life saving ac.

I don't think the unhoused 'ruined' anything. They are living ruined lives while the privileged among us do nothing to help but sit around bitching because they don't want to have to look at people being poor.

This entire city is ruined because most Tacomans look at extreme poverty and their first thoughts veer towards hate and prejudice. So instead of changing the decades long failures of the existing homeless policies, we keep doing the same failures over and  over and blame the unhoused.

That is ruinous. This city has a deep case of hate and immorality. And it comes mostly from the housed people looking down on the folks who have to sleep on dirt.

Those people on the street have limited choices. Sadly most housed peoples reaction to that is to choose hate. ""Aw gee I wonder if they'll get a cobbled together AC again after they ruined everything in the last filthy place the ended up, how awful they moved to a cleaner spot since maid service and garbage haul-away waasn't working in the old spot. WHY don't they just live on a garbage pile? Why'd they have to move?''

I hope this summer they have a movie projector with a stereo system and 3 ac's. They deserve something of comfort and joy until Tacoma gets off of its selfish hateful ass and houses OUR citizens. Mostly I hope they get housing. That way they don't have to be exposed to hate 24/7 from people privileged enough to retain their housing in this economy and housing market. Imagine having to live life knowing everyone who look at you thinks you less than human and gets insulted if you make a bit of comfort for yourself in your street tent because you obviously don't even deserve basic comfort.

"I think there delays in city and county services all over due to massive extreme poverty in Tacoma and pierce county, and covid restrictions, etc. Someone mentioned it taking several months to get abandoned vehicles dealth with. The city has to work with property owners to get property owners to remove them from private property.

The resources available to most unhoused are either overwhelmed, or have requirements most people would not or cannot reach.

It is so tragic the bar to receive shelter and services is so high. But most people with even a trace of humanity in them will not abandon their family and pets to the street so they can take a single shelter bed, often where some kind of religious indoctrination is required to even get in the door. So many who end up on the street stay there long term.

I know of one situation where a man and his daughter cannot get shelter. men's shelters won't allow his daughter, shelter services for her means she leaves her dad on the street. Shelter for either means they must separate their family.

I defy anyone to say there are choices for this family, but to stay together, and that means the street right now. I for one would never leave anyone I love alone on the street with all the danger that entails, for a shelter bed for me.

Hopefully, with enough complaints and manpower you will get your situation deal with.  If we can manage to stop overwhelming everything with covid every few months, maybe a lot of these issues could be remedied in the future.

The citizens of Tacoma, housed and unhoused, deserve so much better.

"Being able to change zoning laws and solving crime are two very different things.

Having this myopic view that things would get better if we were only ""tough on crime"" is what got us here in the first place. The solution to crime has to be approached in a holistic manner if we want to address the root cause of crime and the societal factors that push people to become criminals in the first place. We have to take a step back and look at the big picture.

Unfortunately, as has been pointed out, years of stripping away social services and the nurturing of an extremely punitive incarceration system have put us in a position where things are so dire, we don't even have time to address the root causes. As that is long term.

I'd really like to know more about this crime spree from a statistical standpoint. Who the heck is going around shooting up the city? I've seen people say drugs but drug crimes are actually down 60% compared to last year. I've also heard a lot of hearsay regarding the state of TPD and that they are unwilling to enforce the law because of the new bill that was passed? So they are just letting criminals run free now or something?

There's such a lack of real information and data surrounding this rise in crime, I'd like some official to explain what the hell is going on because all Ive heard is rumors and hearsay.

"I'm trying to get people killed? You're getting desperate, Glynn (if that's your name) for something to use in this debate. You've got two examples that were reported in the media. I live in the trenches here bud, whatever townhouse you've got up in Fircrest, or Pearl st, isn't gonna give you a good picture of what shit is really like on ground level.

 The shit I'm talking about has happened *to* me. It has happened to my *neighbors*. I have watched people walk past methheads stealing people's cars; I'm guilty of it myself, and I regret it. You're trying to deny, again, that there is a culture problem here. I'm literally, in some ways, a part of it, and I'm also a witness to it. 

 You have not lived in South End Tacoma. I can tell by the side you've taken. I would even daresay that you haven't ventured past 38th, for that matter, spare a few occasions. You do not sleep with one eye open. You don't wake up in the morning with your car gone, or to the furious screaming of your neighbor who works a dead end job when *his* car is gone. 

 Once again, I'll say it, likely to no avail: Other places are *not* like this. Theft gets prosecuted in other cities. It does not here. When people fall down, their neighbors and friends pick them up in other cities, most, anyway. In this city, friends are few and far between, and they are even less likely to help you. We do not have a good community here. We are not knit together, spare for two or three people cliques. 

 You are content with regarding these circumstances with neglect, because you don't go through it. In a way, you're evidence of the culture problem here, just as much as I am, and others. I turned a blind eye to petty theft when I knew I could have done something. You turn a blind eye to the streets and use statistics to comfort you.

"So, Apologies. Im serious. This last comment showed genuine introspection and im grateful that you put up with my boorishness so that we could actually engage in a dialogue.

However, I like to respond to people's comments chronologically, top to bottom so it might seem like i'm attacking you again, when i mean to defend my language and clarify my own meanings.  We'll get there I promise.


Just so we're on the same page; sealioning isn't really a good thing/compliment - ""Sealioning is a harassment tactic by which a participant in a debate or online discussion pesters the other participant with disingenuous questions under the guise of sincerity, hoping to erode the patience or goodwill of the target to the point where they appear unreasonable.""  You weren't explicitly asking harassing questions, but you were playing the victim to make it look like i was being unreasonable; ""Wow. Yet another assumption"" ""Whatever. I am over it. Internet bullies are the worst."" etc. You even continue with in your last comment ""I can‚Äôt even explore my thoughts and feelings without being attacked"", which brings us to your next point:

""People are hella mean.""  Yes but often not with out a reason.  This is one of the mechanisms that society uses to weed out bad/immoral ideas.  If an idea is expressed that cannot stand up to public scrutiny then it should be tossed to the side. If people constantly attack your ideas, it may be time to explore different ideas, or at least try to understand why it is people think your idea is bad. I will accept my roll in this.  I think some of your ideas are bad.  I don't think you originally thought them, so i'm not directly attacking you, it just might feel like it. The biggest one for me is the position of the moderate, Shit or get off the pot.  You're either for the proletariat or you're against them, Moderates are just rocks in the river of progress damming up the flow with inane questions.

"And what I'm saying is that it is in control.

Plenty of people pointed out that crime would rise as cost of living increased and nothing was done to curb it or keep people off the streets.

We make policy decisions, knowing full well what the effects will be, because we'd rather fund a carceral than one where we reward good behavior. It is clearly easier to whip up public support for a system that costs too much and doesn't work than it is to create support for a system that would save money & lives but might make people feel cheated.

There's an entire catalog of reports and presentations that explained to federal all the way down to local governments about how cutting poverty reduces crime. We see this regardless of the country, ethnicity, race, or sex of the recipient. Give someone a reason to keep participating in the system and they will participate. When they do everything right and still fall behind, they will look for shortcuts to catch up.
