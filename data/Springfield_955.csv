"Great parks and rec district im Williamalane. On the whole housing may be a little more affordable, property taxes a tad lower.

"West Centennial (west of the water tower, really), Hayden Bridge, and Washburn are probably the nicer areas that are still super convenient to everything in Eugene, too. Thurston has some good neighborhoods, too, but it's on the east side of the community and definitely attracts more conservative/Trump types than other parts of town.

One thing that I don't see mentioned enough is that we have a fairly functional city government and taxpayers who will support solution-oriented options. For example, property crime was nuts and even if someone got arrested, the county jail would almost immediately release them due to overcrowding, so Springfield now has its own jail. Eugene's aggressive homeless population knows that panhandling and other activities if done in Springfield can also lead to jail time, so you can walk in downtown Springfield in relative safety. The reason Riverbend Hospital wound up in Springfield instead of Eugene is that Eugene's City Council is that Eugene made the process too restrictive and onerous.

"Lots of Trumpers, but even in Thurston (East Springfield), where they seem to number the highest, that specific area voted nearly 50/50 last election, with a trend to blue from the 2016 election. Head west a a mile or two, and that area voted more blue than red. The closer you get to Eugene, the bluer the vote was.

Anyways, it seems the Trumpers are louder than they are numerous. Some of the blue line trump flag fliers are just plain loud. Like the rolling coal, 4 flags flying, super lifted trucks with a blue line decal, a Joe and The Hoe sticker and a gadsden banner. Ooof.

"I live 2 blocks from Washbourne, nearly behind the Pool. I purchased the house 3-4 years ago.

I felt I had to move here to get an affordable home... which I'm currently spending all my spare change to fix. (purchase price was 250K - needs 60k in repair) Lots of homes are in disrepair. Must be because everyone is broke. Have a rundown rental house down the street that treats the neighborhood as their own personal parking lot for junk cars. Many front yards are filled with trash.

The are not progressive here. Trump is everywhere and the shitty entitled attitude (don't come here because I'm better then you) that comes with it. Judgmental and rude - so, so rude. My neighbor, who is a member/leader of the Proud Boys said to me when I moved in. ""We look after our own kind here"". Thank goodness I'm white. If this bothers you, watch where you eat/shop. Some places I now avoid.

There is lots - lots - of graffiti, trash and heroin... everywhere. Homelessness is prevalent (not as bad as Eugene); never seen human poop stains on buildings until I moved here. Dogs love it.

City services are nice. Police come when called and although it took several months to deal with the above neighbors, they were kind and persistent. Kudos to them. Get cheap cameras so you can watch people dig through your trash and climb your fences.

Utilities are way cheap... but the power goes out 3-4 times a year. Street sweepers are frequent... so they try to keep it clean here. Unlike Eugene, permits are not required for many things... good/or bad. 

It can be quiet, but it is full of helicopters, train horns, Redneck loud autos/bikes, industrial noises at all hours. The school events are a welcomed distraction from the other din.

The smell from the wood mill can and does get very 'pungent'... you can not live anywhere without it lingering.

I really like: I can walk my dogs with ease. Fairly close to the start of the bike trail system here. Easy access to Eugene/freeways. Not many variety of stores, but they are close. My postal person is awesome. Some streets are wide and filled with trees... makes great photos and adds a big city feel to it.

"Agreed on lower cost of living all around (I reaaallllly miss being on SUB). Our parks are really nice, too. Our library is small but enthusiastic; the staff are phenomenal.

We lived quite a few years in the Washburne district, and once you get used to the noise from the high school football field, it was a pretty quiet neighborhood. The best part was that everything was in walking distance: library, post office, Grocery Outlet, and all of downtown, plus the big Willamalane Park.

We moved to Northwest Centennial/Rainbow for about 5 years, and that was also a lot quieter than I was expecting, although the traffic from the Duck football games will be something to contend with if you move anywhere vaguely near Autzen. We got used to just staying home on Home Game days.

If schools are a consideration, so far our experience with individual schools has been pretty good. Our kiddo needed extra support in elementary school, and he had a great experience there. At district level, it can be frustrating, but it does feel like they have the kids' best interests at heart.

We've had really great neighbors every place we've lived. Culturally and socially I don't feel like there's a huge difference from neighborhood to neighborhood. Just be prepared for the ""Springtucky"" comments from a certain cast of Eugenean.

"This is about the sign I made a post about.

Fun fact, The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety did study in Washington and survey people about roundabouts, Before construction, the number of drivers in favor of roundabouts was only 31 percent, and those strongly opposed was 41 percent. After driving them, this shifted to 63 percent in favor and only 15 percent strongly opposed. Same study found found that roundabouts contributed to an 89 percent reduction in delays and 56 percent reduction in vehicle stops.

From what I read, the owner does not really understand roundabouts and traffic flow. 

""I just wish the city council would represent the tax payers and the business owners, and they don’t seem to do that.""

I don't understand this.

I’ll agree book burning isn’t acceptable. And separation of church and state is also an absolutely fundamental thing that has been eroded. I also think laws regulating what anyone chooses to do with their body’s are bad… I will however say that I think teachers curriculums should be more closely regulated. They shouldn’t be injecting all kinds of opinions or religious beliefs into these lessons. It should just be math science reading etc…. Really though overbearing government is a huge issue. Government is pretty much out of control trying to control and regulate all the average people.

"Natural rights? You know that is a MANMADE CONSTRUCT. what natural rights do you actually have? We are born into this bullshit with no choice. We are MADE to play along.

The “government” isn’t some abstract concept. It’s people. People do this to other people. We have allowed fascism to creep into our country and it’s example is NOT MASK MANDATES. it’s book burning.

"I don't mind sharing at all.

West 18th is an incredibly creepy street at night. I have had close calls with people and something else before...by something else I mean shadow people. 

New Years Eve 2007  

My friends and I were up to mischief, laying a few pranks and wandering the Amazon bike path as we normally would. The night was fun but when we were heading back to my duplex off 17th we saw what we thought was a drunk person, it was staggering very slowly and when we got to a certain distance it moved incredibly fast and vanished. 

The second time I encountered something like this it was off of Oak patch and 18th. I had just got to the outside of my complex and decided to have a smoke after a long creepy walk. The street  was empty, no other smokers, most of my neighbors were asleep and definitely no traffic. I saw someone coming down the road very very slowly,I couldn't make out any features but the way they were moving it looked like a drunk or a tweaker...it was also moving very awkwardly. I was watching to make sure I knew what was coming at me just in case...than it suddenly moved insanely fast and vanished into the side of a tree. It was terrifying. 

&#x200B;

I have mountains of stories and this is 100 percent true. I can not say for sure what I saw but it was incredibly creepy. I have dedicated years and years of my life hunting down any and all ghost stories or urban legends around the area.

"I can list off a few haunted locales in town, these are places I have visited. 

1.The old Downtown LCC building 

A janitor was crushed under the service elevator in the basement of the old LCC building, I used to have classes in the basement there. The elevators are famously haunted there.  

2.Spyglass cemetery 

The Spyglass cemetery is hidden on top of a hill past a hiking trail.   
Some of the graves no longer have names attached, its supposed to have lots of weird happenings. Its tricky to get to but well worth the hike. 

&#x200B;

3.Bijou Art Cinema off 13th is supposedly haunted by the ghost of young actress in red, the story I have heard most of the time is that it used to be an old funeral home before it was a cinema.  When I was 19 I was trying to take some pictures of the place and my camera screen glitched out, after I left the area of the Bijou it was normal again. 

&#x200B;

Are you aware that the children's mrna ineutrons contain an added ingredient. Tromethamine is a blood acid reducer used to stabilize a patient after a heart attack. These injections do not work against Omicron-per White House. They are dangerous. There is a case at the International Court in the Hage about them. Think Nuerenburg trials. There is also a major court case in Texas look into it. It is so well done & the evidence is clear! Look up attorney Carl Rentz & see his testimony on Monday January 24th 2022. Your son is likely to get this bug & be under the weather for a day or so then have lifetime immunity from this Pandemic. Don't screw that up with an injection that is risky & won't give him permanent protection! Don't make your child a slave to the pharmaceutical industry. They will start charging for these things & he won't have the choice to stop once that mrna vector is put there by you. I implore you to please do your research!!!!

"Ah so you raise a good point! Variables! Indeed something often overlooked in these silly State A with a freedom loving patriot for a governor is doing better/worse than State B with a literal communist for a governor. 

Your flaw, however, is cherry picking a factor and not realizing it also applies to your data. That's actually a joke, because you didn't provide any data, so obviously there cannot be any flaws in that which doesn't exist. 

But for fun let's look at average age. The oldest state in the country, based on average age, is Maine, with an average age of 45. Maine also happens to have the 4th lowest covid death rate in the country. Interesting!

Florida, correctly, is an older population with an average age of 42.5 compared to our average age of 39.6. That could be a factor in their higher death rate. But your other freedom loving state, Texas, has a younger average age at 35 (in actuallty, the youngest state in the country tied with Alaska). 

So now we'd have to figure that the highest average age in Maine explains their low death rate, but the higher average age in Florida explains their lower death rate, while the lower average age in Texas explains their higher death rate. 

Perfectly clear!

But in fact, there are a lot of variables here. As you note, overall health. Though one could also argue that the same sort of red state policies that have driven covid death tolls are a factor in their poor average health as well. But anyway, I can probably think of a dozen other variables off the top of my head. There are surely many more I haven't thought of. The good news is every state doing their own thing has given us a LOT of data to do the multi-variable analysis in the years to come to figure out what factors matter, what helped and what didn't. The bad news is that nobody will likely care, because politics are more important than evidence and data (currently at least). 

So for better or worse, these State A vs State B pissing contests are pretty pointless.

"Nah. I've encountered many manipulating people such as yourself before. Thats not gonna fool me. The question I truly wanna ask is this. The flu once it comes to younger people was much deadlier to them than covid ever was and currently still is. Yet nobody ever argued to wear masks to protect young people and children. Why? What made masks all of a sudden important to wear to ""protect your fellow man"" now but back then it didn't matter to wear a mask? Ultimately my opinion is this. It is nobodies moral responsibility to make sure you don't get sick with a sickness that you might not even have. That is absolutely ludicrous. Yes, its your responsibility to not purposely get people sick if you know that you're sick with something. Thats one thing. But if you don't have any symptoms of anything why the hell should you act like you are at all times? Absolute insanity. So no, I'm not gonna wear a mask. I refuse. I do promise however, as I have been doing my entire life anyways, that if I am sick with literally anything I stay home and don't go in contact with anybody u til I'm all better.

The police got a ping off Parker’s phone from the 23rd (when they left to camp).

The ping came from somewhere around Cottage Grove, Oakridge, and somewhere off of Hyw 58. They had mentioned a Sather Hill Mountain, which I was told was close to Heckeltooth Mountain. A family member just pointed out that they could be close to a hot Springs in the area because Christian really enjoys them. Maybe Mccredie Springs? 

The police said that there’s 50 inches of snow in that area. A search team will be sent in the morning. The police were VERY clear that they don’t want more people to search for in the snow, these are dangerous circumstances.

"Here is [a link](https://occup-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6673-5-28) to an article in the *Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology* summarizing the initial “trend” of this type of suicide which attracted attention in Japan in 2008. I feel safe posting this as the “recipe” uses items which are difficult to acquire in the US. 

What I really want to emphasize to everyone is how incredibly dangerous this can be to good samaritans and unprepared first responders. I moved here from the NYC metro area and over the last year I’ve been overwhelmed with how nice and caring people here are in general. (In Manhattan, someone doing this wouldn’t be noticed for days, unless they were blocking traffic.) Just breaking a window or opening a door can kill you, and y’all are awesome and I really don’t want to see anyone get hurt.

So please, stay safe. If you see someone unresponsive in a car with a bucket of something on the seat or floor, back the hell up, call 911, and tell them it may be a hazmat. And if you’re thinking about doing this, please - [get help.](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) Someone **will** miss you.

"Um... That's false. Not the air quality part. The air quality definitely sucks here. But did you read what you linked? It literally ends with this:

""... Please stop saying that Willamette means “the valley of sickness and death.” Please know that if the natives later referred to this valley as one of “sickness and death,” it came from the biological genocide inflicted on the natives by this civilization. Please go to the library, or better yet find a living native, and learn the real history of this place.""

That post does give the likely origin of the word Willamette, but it has nothing to do with ""the valley of sickness"". 

Here's another [article](https://wildhunt.org/2013/07/deconstructing-local-mythologies.html) that goes into debunking the whole ""valley of sickness"" myth. 

TLDR from the article: ""Whenever I hear the myth mentioned in my presence, my response has become almost automated. “That story is bullshit. The Kalapuya were sick with smallpox, not hay-fever, and pollen wasn’t an issue in the valley until agribusiness moved in. If you don’t like the hay-fever, blame the grass seed companies, but retelling that story only serves to disrespect the original inhabitants of the valley.”""

Not to call you out; you're not the only one I've heard say it. People around here do love that story.

"There's certainly weather inversions that happen in this area, especially in the colder months, which can trap pollution and smoke close to the ground. That might contribute to what you're experiencing. However, in addition, I've noticed more bad smells near downtown lately.

"Guessing most parents have seen this by now but to put rumors to rest the following email came out from the principal of SHS today-

*To ensure that we can minimize rumor and speculation, I wish to make you aware of a concerning conversation that began on social media and ultimately created a disruption yesterday.*  
  
*I am proud of several students who reported that an inappropriate social media account was created utilizing my photo and spreading troubling statements, inappropriate and foul language, and most concerning some threatening messages towards our school community. Our team worked with Officer Newton to investigate and by the end of the day Officer Newton had located and made an arrest for disorderly conduct for attempting to create panic and disruption at our school.*  
  
*To be clear, there was no weapon located, no specific threats to individuals and the arrest took place off-campus. I share this to limit any lingering concern based on inaccurate information circulating online.*  
  
*This situation serves as an important reminder that even if statements are made in an attempt at humor, pretending to impersonate another online or any messages that can be interpreted as direct or indirect threats are not acceptable, and potentially illegal.*  
  
*Parents and guardians, please take this as an opportunity to speak with your student about appropriate online behavior. Students, if you encounter concerning social media posts or accounts please continue to bring them forward to a trusted adult rather than sharing them further and increasing their reach.*  
  
*I wish to commend Officer Newton for his work on uncovering the source of the false account, and continuing to ensure safety at our school.

In the rain, with your lights on, it's really hard to see anything and I make a point to avoid that spot when it's dark. Since it's also a construction area right now it's even funner!

The roundabout off Pioneer and NW Expressway has a problem with overgrown shrubbery and stuff obscuring pedestrians as well, but it's much smaller and it's not surrounded by lights and signs and stuff.   


I don't personally have an issue with roundabouts but I've had a number of close calls in them since they were installed in Springfield - invariably because someone either fails to yield, or they panic and try to change lanes without being aware of where they're going or who's near them.",t2_gaf51nov,Abashed_Astrolabe,0,1636333218.0,0,t1_hjqxkx6,hjqxkx6,False,laffnlemming,t3_qdjc6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpringfieldOR/comments/qdjc6g/kval_odot_and_springfield_to_take_measures_to/,KVAL: ODOT and Springfield to take measures to improve safety on Main Street,/r/SpringfieldOR/comments/qdjc6g/kval_odot_and_springfield_to_take_measures_to/hjqxkx6/,1,r/SpringfieldOR,0,1
