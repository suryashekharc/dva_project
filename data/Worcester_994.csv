I'm not sure if anyone else can chime in, but there's a parking lot directly across from the Palladium that I'd recommend first (Court Park); I just have no idea if they open anymore.

Worcester is becoming gentrified very quickly. New businesses; way more food options than I’ve ever seen.

"Canal District has been closed since the pandemic went into full swing, I doubt it will be back.

The Beaver Brook one is Mondays and Friday in the Beaver Brook parking lot on Chandler. They have bread, meat and veggies. It's not too bad, but seems to be the best one we can find in the city.

Grafton Farmers Market is on Wednesday, used to be in the common but I think they'll be moving it - so check in on that. They have veggies, meat, and niceties like snack vendors and people who sell various wares.

Shrewsbury Farmers Market is also Wednesday at the town hall. I find this one to be a bit lax on actual food but they do have a meat/eggs person, a couple produce farms and they usually have Mrs. Moriconi's Ice Cream cart there.

These are the ones I frequent, but there are quite a few in the surrounding towns, here is the site to find them:

"There are two areas for working out with weights, machine, cardio, etc. I personally have been satisfied with the equipment (both climbing related and non). The areas aren't the largest so sometimes it can be a little crowded depending on when you are there. It's never been a major issue for me. I know there are some members who don't climb much but just workout, which I think is a positive sign.

The Worcester gym is the first CRG so some of the walls are a bit dated, but they added a more modern bouldering extension recently so there is some good variety. The climbing within the grades can be highly variable from some things being graded a bit too hard to being somewhat soft. For the most part, I find there is a good variety of styles and enough intriguing climbs to return to on weekly basis. Recently the bouldering turnover has been a little too fast with a climb only being up 3-4 weeks, hopefully with winter ending they slow down a bit. There is also a new bouldering only gym 30min away in Framingham if you ever get bored. The community and culture is a mixed bag. There are more casual climbers from the surrounding colleges but you still have long time gym and outdoor crushers. Making solid climbing friends can be a bit difficult, but I chalk that up to the more broad New England culture. The people who I have become friends with though, are some of the best people I've ever meet and will have life long relationships with.

Lastly, the best thing about Worcester is it's smack dab in the middle of New England so getting out and exploring is relatively easy. With so much outdoor climbing nearby, its easy to do a half day to a full weekend. It has easily been the most fun and fulfilling part of living in Worcester personally.

"No dude, I see traffic bullshit all over the city, and in my time living where I live, have seen cops 3 times, and all 3 times was because of an accident or the time my neighbor was having a gun related issue. Meanwhile I have almost hit children riding their atvs on city streets and seen dirt bike dickheads harassing drivers and people walking down the street. 

Being a cop is more about stopping one thing or another, it’s about policing the community at large. Obviously I want them to focus their attention on gun shots, but policing is a 24/7/365 and I imagine there are a lot of times people aren’t shooting each other in the middle of the day

"They aren’t completely wrong. Either Worcester improves because the current residents get up and vote for progress (instead of staying home while the white elderly voters decide the course the city takes) or new people move in who will vote for progress. 

Sure, gentrification shouldn’t be necessary to clean up the city and make it a more liveable option, but if the current residents refuse to vote and be engaged, then what’s the alternative? 

The problem is that new people generally don’t have the same concerns.

There is no reason for Worcester to have a mayor and city manager. Changing to a strong mayor system (like Boston and every other city) was voted on years ago but following typical Worcester trends all of the elderly voters didn’t want to make any changes to the current system.

"I really think it’s way way too much malice put behind one still image on Reddit. We all know that those colors are constantly cycling through multiple patterns. Are you really telling me that this wasn’t scrolling through red, white, and blue patterns because OP just happened to take a picture in this combination we should all jump to the conclusion that Worcester Mass or Shrewsbury Mass governments support Russia?

There is **no where near** enough evidence in this post to make any conclusions. This is nothing more than a conspiracy theory. Quite frankly we should **all** hold ourselves to a higher standard and put some more critical thought into stuff before jumping wild conclusions. 

And the parallel OP is drawing is a wild conclusion. So again, what evidence in this post should make any of us care about the color a bridge for one second?

Edit: I spent less than five minutes looking for additional context on this bridge and found two articles about how the Mass DOT specifically and intentionally colored the bridge in support of Ukraine

And one tweet from the Mass DOT about this military appreciation light show. In the images they shared, you can see that the colors on the bridge consistently change.

"Thanks man. You honestly have given me a great deal to consider because you're right, I've certainly been an abuser of all kinds *in the past*. I used to drink heavily every weekend and now I will barely have 1 drink with dinner out, if I drink at all because the hangovers stopped being worth it when I turned 26; I would do all sorts of party drugs at music festivals and concerts. Now LSD makes me vomit nonstop every time now so I cut that out (last time was juuust before the pandemic). I did molly for the first time in years about 6 or 7 months ago had an amazing experience and haven't done any more since (nor have even tried to look for it). I used to abuse the hell out of adderall though. Then I had an incident mid December '20 where I did more adderall than I had intended to (thought the dose was 5 mg but it was 10mg so I did 20 instead of expected 10) smoked a ton of weed and stayed up all night and experimented with unsafe assplay over like 7 or 8 hours. I ended up in crippling pain for days after that and I haven't even looked at Adderall since. I also told Wendy to take all the weed stuff with her when she leaves just to really make it stuck that I need a long break and my parents are coming up tomorrow to stay with me for a couple of weeks in my spare bedroom.

I appreciate you looking out for me.

"I once applied the same rationality and justification to my drinking. I didn't have a problem, I just liked to drink..... a lot. You talk about will power, no amount of will power cures addiction because there is no cure only treatment, only abstinence. Dependence isn't about amounts or degrees, you  can't be just a little dependent or say, half dependent. Addiction hides behind rationalities and justification and is very good at it. The concepts that surround addiction and sobriety are abstract and are at first difficult to embrace. Please understand that I'm not trying to force you to do anything other than to think about what I've said. I can tell you there is an up side and rewards.

"It is legitimate. Their current electricity rates are lower than National grid's default rate and are locked in through the end of '22 or '23. Also most of the energy is sourced from renewable energy sources. I believe it's about 5¢-8¢ cheaper per kWh. It only will change the source of energy and not the delivery fee which is set by national grid. 

If I remember correctly they will let you know if the rates are going to be increased at the end of their current contract and you'll have the choice to opt out or opt in again. Not sure which.

Someone mentioned something about Solar l, so I would check in on that. Also if you want to pay more than the Worcester default rate and less than National grid's default rate for 100% renewable energy, that's an option.

"I appreciate that man. I was definitely using the drugs to fill a void. There was a time when I smoked weed casually with friends and it was a fine time. I'm still trying to be hopeful that I can start again with it someday and use it for what I used to, to bond with people and make friends. Im not quitting because I feel I'm an addict, I don't feel I've crossed that line, my dependency was a reaction to a bad situation I found myself in with no other way out, it was a product of my environment. I'm taking a break because I need to clear my head of outside influences right now and focus on getting back out there in the community and building myself back up. Finding a healthier environment, making friends that I can bond with over new things. When I went hard into weed two years ago, I believed the common misconception that there's no way to get addicted. I only recently even found out that you get anxiety and hot flashes as a withdrawal symptom after enough time smoking every day.

Perhaps I'm naive, but I want to believe in my own willpower still. I was straight edge in high school because I never wanted to have any sort of chemical dependence on anything. Somewhere along the way I forgot that and I'm going to work hard to never be dependent on any sort of drug again.",t2_anq7e,Veragoot,0,1647912971.0,0,t1_i1lwtsy,i1lwtsy,False,Veragoot,t3_tjhr2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tjhr2q/making_new_friends_in_worcester/,Making new friends in Worcester,/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tjhr2q/making_new_friends_in_worcester/i1lwtsy/,2,r/WorcesterMA,0,2

"Hey Andrew! 

I wanted to tell you that when I was new to the area and didn't have many friends, I made a TON of connections by attending some of the local fitness groups, with the added benefit of getting in shape at the same time as making these friends? 

We as humans tend to be more like the people we hang out with, so I thought surrounding myself with fitness people would be great for me, and it was. Before I knew it, I went from not really doing much of anything socially or fitness wise to running a few half marathons and having multiple social engagements every week!

"Hi, Andrew. Recovering alcoholic here, 43 years sober. With any addiction there's no way out but cold turkey. The good news is this is a perfect time for you to do this. You are at a low point in your life, you wouldn't even think of quitting if things were going well for you. Everyone's bottom is different but you know when you've hit it. Dark times for sure but a good time to reflect and really see how you got there. I was near death and still had to be dragged kicking and screaming to an AA meeting. Actually I was too ill to go to a meeting but when I was up to it I went and with zero expectations, zero enthusiasm. The truth is I didn't think that even AA could help me. I was wrong. I'm still an alcoholic and will always be but I will die sober. There is support for you in NA, Narcotics Anonymous. People will argue that weed isn't a narcotic but that isn't the issue, addiction is. Addiction comes in many forms and is characterized by the disruption it causes in all other aspects of your life. Sobriety is not a miracle, not a magic solution but will improve the quality of your life I guarantee it. Before you commit to sobriety you must understand that it isn't a vacation from addiction, that will never change. I don't know what makes an addict an addict I just know there's a line one crosses and it's permanent. If I picked up a drink now I'd be right back where I was 43 years ago. Sorry to go on so much about this but I can tell you there's a better life out there for you, it's starts with recognizing that you are worth it. Many of us in AA and NA found that our sense of worth was very low and we had ceased loving ourselves. Think about this Andrew, you know in your heart that you'd help anyone in your situation in a heart beat, so what about you.

"Nah, you're just standing in the middle of a storm and you're all wet and cold.  It's really, really hard to think straight when you're wet and cold, right?  Wait it out.  Eventually the storm will end and you'll dry off and the sun will come out to warm you.  

Problem is nobody can tell you when the storm will end.  But it WILL end.  You just gotta wait it out.  Allow yourself to be sad at how wet you are and angry at the unfairness of the storm.  But never stop acknowledging that if you just wait long enough, the storm will run out of fury and you'll see the sun again.

Life is all about fucking up in ways you can't even believe.  Break your problems down into little chunks and make plans.  If you fuck up those plans, make new plans.  Think of it less like moving forward on a linear path and more like moving in any direction in the middle of the woods.  If you just walk forward, you're probably going to run into a tree.  So instead you zig zag to avoid trees, backtrack a bit to avoid that muddy swamp, and just keep heading whatever direction your feet are pointing.

"I know this is not what you asked and I might get downvoted to hell *but*...

Have you looked into a training (shock) collar?
I live on a busy street and rent.  Big yard but no fence.  I got a dog my daughter begged for.  But if the dog got out without a leash, or pulled the leash from her hand it was *catastrophic*.

I got a training collar.  The shock can be adjusted in severity from 1-99.  35 feels like a strong elastic band snapped against my skin.  It also has a ""vibrate"" button and a ""beep beep"" noise button.  I trained the dog on it.  I would call her.  If she didn't come I would call her again.  If she didn't come I would give her the ""beep-beep"".  Then again ""beep-beep"" and shock at **25**.  She would look surprised and run over to me for protection.  I literally did this **TWICE** and she was trained.  Now we can play in the yard and woods behind the house.  I only need to call her or use the ""beep-beep"" for the past 5 years.  I'm wary to suggest it because some people are awful.  But it works great under the right owner.

Edit:  If going around other dogs I would not use it even when not listening, because I think the beep noise would scare her to think the other dog is dangerous, and would make her afraid of playing with them.",t2_vc02y,Laurenann7094,0,1647874751.0,0,t1_i1jcexx,i1jcexx,True,SonuvaGunderson,t3_timeme,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/timeme/enclosed_fields_to_run_my_dog/,Enclosed fields to run my dog,/r/WorcesterMA/comments/timeme/enclosed_fields_to_run_my_dog/i1jcexx/,1,r/WorcesterMA,0,1

"If you're into nerdy stuff I believe That's Entertainment (comic book and all-around nerdastic shop) has different kinds of events. 

Art- join a class or find a local group. Or start one yourself!

You like animals - volunteer. Not sure if any shelters around here do this but some shelters will let you basically rent a shelter dog for a few hours. My brother and SIL used to do that. If you find a shelter that does that you could get a dog, give it a day on the town, take it to a dog park and meet people there. Two birds one stone.

If you like any sort of sport/physical activity you could find a recreational group. I have found fellow runners to be particularly friendly. I've also had success meeting people through rec volleyball at a local church. (Not around here, I just moved states)

One thing I did to meet people when I was in a new city (before moving to Worcester) was start a movie lovers group. I invited a few friends from different areas of my life (church, work, school) and asked them each to invite a friend. Then the next time I asked everyone that previously attended to bring another friend. We watched a movie at my house every 3 weeks. Everyone would bring a snack to share before the movie and we'd all chat and eat. And each week a different person would volunteer to be the movie host. They'd pick a movie, pick a food theme, and if they wanted they could do something like host a trivia after the movie and give out fun prizes. I was pleasantly surprised that people were really into it! I ran the group for about a year and I made a few friends from it as well. It wasn't anything big.

"Hello fellow 20ish individual,

There’s actually a ton of nightlife in Worcester. There isn’t much high end clubs or dancing but more relaxed retro vibes. Top recommendations:
- Beer garden (outdoors/live music)
- free play bar (arcade bar with cover)
- one eyed jack’s (tiki bar/restaurant with live)
- the revamped canal has tons of bars too.

There are ton of nature and scenic things to do in Worcester. Trails and hiking a are popular since we have a ton of hidden gems. Food is super popular here. It’s a really foody city. Join public groups, clubs and leagues; they’re the fastest way to grow your social circle.

"It's been that way for as long as I can remember. Webster Square Plaza opened in the late 50s - early 60s when shopping plazas were becoming a thing. Even then the Stafford St  section of the parking lot was used to dump snow. There were several locations around the city where this occurred. The one I remember most was on McKeon Rd where the snow was dumped into the Blackstone canal. Winters then were longer and produced a lot more snow. I can remember the remains of one of these mountains on McKeon Rd as late as June. Too bad these ugly piles are now a mixture of trash. Time was when snow removal was a priority in Worcester.

"Biggest question here is whether you prefer living in a city, a suburban feeling area, or someplace that feels really rural. All are options for you in this area and based on your $600k budget, you'll have choices in each type of environment.

In Worcester itself, the areas with the type of housing most 3-kid families with a budget like yours would be looking for are in the western and northern parts of town - Tatnuck, Newton Square, and Burncoat. Each of these areas has mostly single family homes with nice sized yards and mostly quiet streets, with businesses scattered throughout. These aren't dense urban neighborhoods, they feel more suburban but they have city conveniences (restaurants, schools, gyms) within short range. In my opinion, Newton Square is the best of these neighborhoods if you like having things within walking distance. In this area you'll have schools, parks, and a few coffee shops and restaurants all within a mile. The Worcester public schools serving these neighborhoods are great in some ways, but not others. They're diverse and will offer great cultural training for your kids. Their average test scores are only okay and they have the resource challenges many urban schools have. But plenty of kids do well there. If you're the type of parent who's active in your kids' education, has them reading a lot outside of school, etc., your kids will get the benefit of learning in a diverse setting and you'll be able to guide them academically without any problem.

Some other surrounding towns feel classically suburban, similar to the Worcester neighborhoods mentioned above in certain ways but more spread out. In these towns you won't typically have anything within walking distance and you'll need to drive farther to get to schools and parks. Some examples are Auburn, Grafton, Holden, and Shrewsbury. Shrewsbury and Grafton, being closer to Boston, are more expensive. Holden is getting very expensive, too. Schools in these towns are rated higher than Worcester but they're lily-white and that's not what all parents want.

A third option is a set of very rural towns mostly to the west. In these towns you can find a 2+ acre lot in the woods and really be away from everybody else, but still have only a 20-30 min commute to Worcester for work. Some of them are Sutton, Charlton, Spencer, Paxton, Rutland, Princeton, Sterling. There is a tranquility and access to nature to be found in these towns that is really remarkable for being so close to a decent-sized city. You'll see stars at night and hear only the wind in the pines much of the time, depending on where precisely you buy. On the other hand, the schools are hit and miss (except the Wachusset district, which is stellar), and town services can be pretty minimal. You may have to haul your own trash and/or recycling to the dump, for example, and you'll need a good generator because the aging forest takes out a lot of power lines and given the low densities, it takes a long time to get power restored.

We recently moved and were *very* tempted to go for the rural option. We love quiet and the woods. But we ultimately decided there would be just too much driving involved in that lifestyle - 25 minutes each way to work, the kids' school 10 miles away, etc. So we opted for a west side Worcester neighborhood and we're happy with that choice.",t2_20vxhq7v,SmartSherbet,0,1647610969.0,0,t1_i15h6s0,i15h6s0,True,rainbowprinttiger,t3_tgt308,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tgt308/worcester_neighborhoods_suburbs_schools/,"Worcester neighborhoods, suburbs & schools",/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tgt308/worcester_neighborhoods_suburbs_schools/i15h6s0/,7,r/WorcesterMA,0,7

"Real estate is insane here right now, and will only go up for the foreseeable future. I would get a good buyers agent and buy a house if I were moving here from out of state. If you can afford the rent in the city (4 bedroom apartments are unlikely unless its a ""Triple Decker"". Even a decent one of those is 1,000-2,500 a month)  I think the mortgage on a 600,000 dollar house would be in that range. Even on the very short term, it will be a cheaper option. There are houses for rent in the city, mostly near the colleges. 

Taking up a rental near Becker/WPI or Holy Cross could be a good move. Right around May is when most of those kinds of places pop up. At least for the summer while your house hunting. Wherever you buy or rent,  definitely visit the neighborhoods first .  

I bought a house on the east side in 2015 and its valued at double that now. I wouldn't expect quite that kind of increase, but newer buildings will definitely hold their value over old clunkers.

"We've been residents of the city for over 20 years now. The only thing that really sucks about the city is it's distance from Rte 2. It tends to keep a lot of business's from investing. The schools are pretty damn good. The neighborhood we bought our home in is relatively quiet, and clean. But we all work on keeping it that way. Someone is ALWAYS watching. Most of the people that live in our little corner of the city WFH, or are retired.  More people that work in Boston or somewhere either on the commuter rail or along Rte 2 have moved out here the last 5 or so years. It shows in the cars on the roads(which BTW are no worse than many other cities and towns in MA), and the families that have bought home here.  A lot of cities and towns now have higher rates of drug use/abuse and crime.

"The mills closing and industry leaving was a big part of the burgs downhill slide. But a lot of people don't realize it was one of the first city's to open a methadone clinic. People from all over Woo county were forced to go there on a daily basis for court ordered treatment through the latter half of the century. 

Now don't quote me on this, I'm just a recovering addict, but I've heard from multiple addiction clinicians that success rates for recovery are as low as 2%. 

Again, this is my personal speculation on it. Add the clinic, with low success rates, the burg became home to droves of drug addled folks in a matter of a few years, now add that there were no jobs available. And boom, the dirty burg was born.

"My husband and I were house hunting a few years ago, and one of the places we looked into was Fitchburg. Because of its reputation, we knew we could end up with more house compared to other cities nearby. I grew up in Fitchburg, so I knew to make sure if the place was on the ""good end or had end"" of the road. Blossom street goes from low income housing to middle class, to the equivalent of mansions for the area. Albee street is similar except the end near Leominster turns into white picket fences.

There are a lot of great areas. Some drawbacks include Unitil, the most expensive utility company in MA. There are some roads where water has no where to go, so they just form endless potholes. Kimball st and Franklin Rd are great examples. The city doesn't have enough budget for the roads, from what I've heard the state people in charge of distributing money for road repair send out the same amount to city and towns year after year despite costs for road repairs going up.

My biggest complaint about Firchburg? Highway access. The city was essentially skipped by route 2. Unless you live in West Fitchburg or near two different spots of the Leominster border, you have no immediate highway access. Westminster has great highway access, Leominster has 2 and 190 for highways.

"I used to commute from west of Worcester (like, 45min west, lol) to the Bedford area.

AMA

But also I would not recommend. Even with a vehicle that got 50-60mpg (and I was getting all of that, if not better), I was still filling my tank more than I’d like to. And I can’t imagine it now.

It just feels like a long-ass drive. That 1.5hrs feels like 3 when you’re a bit tired and stayed up a bit too late the previous night. I never believed in ‘microsleep’ but do that drive for a year or two and you fucking will, lol.

Prepare to be pulled over left and right by Staties for the smallest infraction. Depending on exactly what time your commute would be, they want to know why you’re on the road so early. I have my own badge, so I can’t imagine what it’s like for civilians, but Staties fucking suck.

What type of work? In my field, there are days where you really, desperately need to get home and collapse. An hour+ drive at the end of a day is the last thing you want to do.

Idk, man, the only plus was I listened to a lot of audiobooks.

"I grew up in central MA. Here's my take:

(I have no background in economics or anything like that so take my words with a grain of salt)

Most cities in MA were industrial in the past (mills, factories, that kind of stuff) and most of that has packed up and gone overseas or elsewhere. Thus, these cities kind of fell into disrepair in the latter half of the 20th century. This is why lots of them seem run down or otherwise unpleasant. 

Couple this with the fact that these days, boston is super expensive to live in, causing more people to look into living in places like lowell, worcester, fitchburg, and Nashua. 

I think over time, they'll only get better as gentrification happens (whether you think thats a good thing or not) but a lot of the buildings and infrastructure are still old and run down, giving them a not-so-nice to look at kind of vibe. 

Compared to 15-20 years ago? Tons of improvement and I think they'll only keep going in that direction, until we can no longer afford to live here either and we move farther out west lol

Fitchburg has fitchburg state university which gives it a tiny bit of ""college town"" feel but its no way near the level of Lowell which feels like half the city is owned by Umass at this point. 

All cities in MA have some very rough parts but also some nicer parts (look at Leominster compared to Fitchburg). I personally feel the pro's of living in MA outweigh the cons of how run down some of the cities can be.  Of course, your mileage may vary, depending on your situation.",t2_yv79z,1upnate,0,1647474799.0,0,t1_i0ybxkx,i0ybxkx,True,HRJafael,t3_tfw1wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tfw1wk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_fitchburg/,What are your thoughts on Fitchburg?,/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tfw1wk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_fitchburg/i0ybxkx/,13,r/WorcesterMA,0,13

"The mid to late 70s is about the same time that Worcester began it's long decline. One by one the factories closed their doors forever. Industry was Worcester's bread and butter and there was a lot related businesses that directly supported industry that also died.When Worcester was a boom town, post WWII to about the early 70s the city had a huge tax base and a lot of money was spent on infrastructure which also included keeping the city clean. When I still lived there, there was no municipal trash pick-up, you could pay for a private service or take it to the landfill yourself. The city would pick up yard debris in the fall, the streets were cleaned every spring and the sewers as well. The water system was flushed regularly and all of the parks were well maintained. In the winter the streets were plowed, sanded and salted. Pot holes were rare because paving was a constant. There were more police and firemen then. I remember there was some litter here and there but nothing like it is now. Something else I've thought about is when I was growing up we weren't as much  a disposable society as we are now.

"It's all in how you are brought up. Our society has declined significantly in my lifetime. I was born in the fifties and throughout my childhood and into my adult years litter was something you just didn't do. I grew up in Main South and even then it was the other side of the tracks. Even so, shabby as it was there was very little litter. Worcester once had neighborhoods that had distinct ethnic identities which engendered a sense of pride of community. There was a collective enforcement of expectations, it was like a large HOA. Again this was universally the ethos of the times. As Worcester declined economically it grew in poverty and those who could, moved on. Real communities disappeared and apathy took hold.

"The city I used to live in wasn't great when I moved there in 2012. It was just starting to show some promise. Comparable to Worcester now. Which is funny because several years ago I was visiting out here and when someone asked me what my previous city was like I said ""It's \[hopefully\] what Worcester will be 10yrs from now"". 

A bunch of really great restaurants opened up. And the city put tons of effort into cleaning up/rebuilding a bunch of rundown neighborhoods and making the downtown area really friendly and walkable. There was a huge food truck scene in that city as well. And every weekend from Spring-Fall the city shuts down several downtown city blocks and has a huge farmers market with great entertainment and food. The city also supports a lot of local artists and there's tons of murals (I see more around here now) and art installations around the city. Not to mention the city throws huge festivals almost every weekend throughout the warmer months to celebrate different cultures. I really hope Worcester moves in this direction.

I moved to Worcester because a loved one is in a bad state of health and I'm trying to help them. So it's not like the city was a huge draw for me. Still, I don't want trash flying everywhere.

And I love restaurant recommendations. I'm vegetarian now but I love a good pizza, Mexican - especially tacos, any great coffee shops/bakeries (Birchtree and Crust are my favorites so far).",t2_16edl1sy,orions_cat,0,1647369946.0,0,t1_i0s7exr,i0s7exr,False,orions_cat,t3_tefg2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tefg2e/worcester_is_the_trashiest_city_ive_ever_lived_in/,Worcester is the Trashiest City I've Ever Lived In,/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tefg2e/worcester_is_the_trashiest_city_ive_ever_lived_in/i0s7exr/,2,r/WorcesterMA,0,2

"The trash collection system in Worcester is exactly what you'd come up with if you wanted a city filled with litter. Real cities provide their residents with wheeled trash and recycling carts with lids and collect bulk waste for free from the curb. They fund this through property taxes and/or the water-sewer bill so people can't opt out of paying and dump their stuff illegally instead. Worcester makes people pay for thin bags, provides few if any public trash bins, makes you take your own stuff to the dump (which is closed most of the year) and pay for the privilege, and lets the recycling contractor people throw whatever they don't want to collect out onto the street. It's a terrible system.

"Current Clark freshman here!

Here are some factors that went into my decision -

I was looking for liberal arts because I'm a person who has no idea what the hell she wants to do in life. I'm originally from the deep south, so the distance did freak my parents out a little. Went on a tour and liked it a decent amount, but for me the college search was kind of a blur. Eventually, it came down to UNC Asheville and Clark. I remember choosing Clark because I cared a bit more about the diversity on campus and I knew that the bulk of people at UNC Asheville would be from in-state. I'm considering majoring in Computer Science, yet haven't declared. It is a LOT of work for Computer Science as of what I've heard. If you want, I can reach out to some friends who are currently in Women and Gender Studies for you!

&#x200B;

Here's my experience with the area -

I don't really spend a lot of time off campus besides going to the train station, the pharmacy/grocery store, or the esports bar in Shrewsbury. I haven't had any incident regarding safety and I know that Clark has a lot of security things in place, including things like Clark Ride (basically after hours, Clark people can pick you up and drive you back home/back to campus etc.). To get to and from the airport/station I've been taking Lyfts and have not felt incredibly insecure. I have yet to really get out into the community. The parties I've been to have all been hosted/ran by students (both on and off campus) and they've been alright. Once again can't say much on things outside campus. There have been maybe two incidents that I've been emailed about involving sketchy people off campus?

&#x200B;

Some info about the diversity/LGBTQIA+ Scene -

In one of my first weeks of Clark, someone said that ""if you pick up a squirrel and throw it at a Clark student, you are more likely to hit someone LGBTQIA+ than not."" I personally am not LGBTQIA+, but I have so many friends that are. People are relaxed about it and it's super normalized to be using correct pronouns and names - one of my classmates even changed their name mid-semester, and the professor understood the changes, and when he messed up, he apologized. There's also currently a group therapy session for LGBTQIA+ students. I haven't been to any one of Prism (the main LGBTQIA+ group I know of)'s events, but I haven't heard anything negative about it so I assume that it's going well. Accessibility is also surprisingly great, and the process to register for an academic/living accommodation is decently simple. I know people who have brought their Emotional Support Animals to campus as well. 

&#x200B;

More on my experience so far -

I'll be honest, I did have a bit of a hard time finding my people and fully adjusting to college life. I'm not the most outgoing person, and most, if not all of my friends from Alabama stayed in the south. Eventually, I began getting involved in clubs and reaching out to people (which was the hardest part for me) to form more personal connections, and that has since helped a lot. All of my teachers so far have been very helpful, approachable, and friendly (even in the Math department, which I found wild). They definitely want to see you succeed. The dorm space I'm in (Dana) is adequate and serves my needs - it's not above and beyond or anything. The food is also alright. I'm a little bit picky and I can usually find something to eat between the Bistro, the dining hall, and the food I have in my room. I have my car on campus, and though it is helpful, I use it only about 1-2 times a week. Counseling is...alright. It can help with basic things. They're definitely available, all the time, however I'm at a point where I'm unsure how much it's helping me. Once again, they do care, yet so many students I talk to advise against CPG. Administration is also meh. Dean of Students has not really helped me with my current needs.

I agree though, the bags are a bit much. Every Christmas I buy a $100 worth of bags for my dad. It makes him so happy since he hates buying them. All I can say to myself over and over: “I’m paying for the garbage workers and feeding their families.” Before I rage at the trash.

Sometimes when I have too much trash or nocturnal animal luring food based trash, I just use regular bags drive across the city and toss all the trash at one of the dumpsters in the hood.

"Fitchburg is not horrible, but you have to be careful with what neighborhood you are looking at. We've been in our home for 21 years now and the worse people are the Trump humpers across the way. Other than that it's a great little neighborhood. Houses are taken care of. Most people work from home, or are retired. It tends to be relatively quiet. We know all the neighbors. Nothing goes un noticed by anyone here. There are plenty of food shopping choices. Some small restaurants that are decent. Down town is still a mess though. Supposedly the company that owns the local Whitney Field mall is still trying to revitalize it, but right now it's not worth bothering with.  But the area is close enough to NH, so we travel to Nashua for any serious shopping. The schools are decent. Our kid was very successful in the school system, and got accepted to every University they applied to, including Ivy League level ones for the STEM program they are in now.  Most parents here actually seem to give a shit about their kids.

I haven't heard of other regional libraries experiencing this yet, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening.  It just so happens that these folks decided to do their crimes in public for all to see.

I don't know.  My goal with this is to pretty much overwhelm them with the point that stealing the books isn't going to get them anywhere.

Not my wheelhouse.  State law allows the trustees to act on this, but the books are currently simply overdue (even though they've told the library they won't return them), so there's not much anyone can do until the books are, in fact, not returned for real.

----

Edit for the obvious transphobic person who replied to me: It's a *book*. One that explains concepts and ideas embraced and supported by the ADA and child psychologists. These books aren't at all aimed at convincing people to be a different gender, they explain other people's issues and struggles and provides scientific data as well about the subject. 

Shocker to fucking nobody but bigots: It's about educating people. A straight or cis person who reads it isn't going to be brainwashed, they'll just have a better fucking understanding of the subject so that maybe - just maaaaybe they can practice empathy and respect for a highly marginalized group and understand them. **The person who replied below me should absolutely read these books to educate themselves on the subject.**

If people want resources and some citations about this subject: [Here ya go - one of my favorite posts on Reddit recently](https://old.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/ta8hvu/parents_of_a_trans_child_who_reached_out_to/hzz79hc/?context=3). 

The TLDR is this:

* People, both trans and cisgender, seem to express their gender around 4-5 at earliest

* Transition for preadolescents is entirely social i.e no hormones or surgery

* In adolescents, transition consists of temporary puberty blockers, causing no long-term effects if they are discontinued. Hormone therapy doesn’t happen until mid-teens

* Genital surgery is never an option until late teens/the early 20s at the youngest

* Allowing transitioning as a child/teen saves lives. Young trans people who are denied any opportunity to transition have a much higher suicide rate than their cis counterparts, as well as higher rates of anxiety and depression

* If there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes.

* Transition vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts, and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people.",t2_13vn8q,DirtyWonderWoman,0,1647276279.0,0,t1_i0mw8td,i0mw8td,True,theartolater,t3_te18lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/te18lk/some_parents_are_trying_to_ban_four_books_at_my/,"Some parents are trying to ban four books at my local library, so I'm holding a book drive to get them in every library in the region",/r/WorcesterMA/comments/te18lk/some_parents_are_trying_to_ban_four_books_at_my/i0mw8td/,24,r/WorcesterMA,0,24

"I'm assuming you're in the same program I currently am, but definitely same school. 

Try to find somewhere within 2 miles to UMMS (or UMass Chan now I guess...) and consider the neighborhood/route you'd have to walk or bike through. Worcester is a driving city, but if you're already close to UMass it's definitely walkable. And frankly, driving across the city during rush hour is beyond frustrating so you wouldn't want to be much further anyways. You don't need to rush out to find another vehicle; I survived for months with my partner dropping me off and picking me up due to my car being totaled or biking (on the sidewalk - the Woo is not very biker friendly). I'm much happier to have another vehicle but I also have animals I keep outside the city so I was glad to have my own wheels again. You will be able to manage without and decide once you're in the situation if another car is something you need.

$1200-$1750 is pretty average for a 2bdrm, and the lower end of that price range is going to put you in some less desirable neighborhoods. Rental rates are going up, too. Definitely reach out to your program, join the FB/chat groups for your class, and start asking around though. There are a lot of houses traded between the UMMS community that are close to school and usually on the cheaper side comparatively (often owned by alum/people only interested in having higher ed students as renters). Don't be afraid to look into some roommate situations, too; a lot of these traded rentals are multi-floor houses and the setup is much more private than a typical roommate situation.",t2_fm8c3,corgibutt19,0,1647267272.0,0,t1_i0mah5j,i0mah5j,True,OneWithTheCruciform,t3_tdqec0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tdqec0/the_rental_market_is_astonishingly_confusing_here/,The rental market is astonishingly confusing here….,/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tdqec0/the_rental_market_is_astonishingly_confusing_here/i0mah5j/,4,r/WorcesterMA,0,4
