"Haha! I applied for a job at Cheap Thrills a little over a year ago. The application itself was extremely arduous. I distinctly remember there being a math section where you had to do long subtraction/addition/multiplication without a calculator to show that you could handle the math of cash transactions. IN THE APPLICATION

Once I finished my app and turned it in, I was emailed to come into the store and complete a ""music questionnaire"" in lieu of an interview. It was the craziest shit I'd ever seen. They'd list a person's name, and you were expected to name the band that that person was in. It's one thing to put John Lennon or Freddie Mercury on there, but they put really obscure names that most wouldn't know, like the name of the drummer from a minimally popular Ska band 30 years ago, or the bass player from a one-hit 80s synth-pop group. Really crazy shit. There were 5 pages to this test, each page with like 20-30 random names. I got maybe 50% of them, but I still didn't get enough of them to get a call back. Turns out it was a blessing in disguise. Your post says a lot, but I can't say it's the first time I've heard these kinds of claims about Richard Ferris' stores.

1. https://www.slobc.org/ has several social/fun rides and you can check their site for some route ideas. I'm a solo rider so I can't vouch for the group.

3. I have never had an issue with traffic (downtown or out on county roads) except for a few right hooks here and there. Ride defensively and you'll be safe.

Folks go pretty quick but the road is only moderately busy around 5-6p, most of the time you’ll only see a car every half mile or so, so cars have no trouble passing.

Urban cycling infrastructure in SLO is just meh. It’s definitely a continuous improvement at a much faster rate than I experienced in LA, but I still wouldn’t even think of going carless in SLO (maybe unless you’re a student living on campus?).

"Lots of homeless shelters and transitional housing, quite a few in the city itself and many more in the surrounding county, the city estimates we have ~500 “individuals experiencing homelessness” and the amount of facilities we have not only to give them shelter but to help them on their feet should they seek it out are capable of handling far more than that.

https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/Departments/Social-Services/Homeless-Services.aspx
https://www.shelterlistings.org/city/san_luis_obispo-ca.html

The problem as with big cities like LA and SF isn’t lack of resources it’s the willingness of those affected to utilize them, I’m not blaming any individual experiencing homelessness I’m sure they feel they have no other choice, but that’s simply not true, the problem as I see it is that our culture dictates that they need to be proactive in seeking help, we certainly wouldn’t want to round them up and put them in “reeducation camps” or something and fix the problem by force. 

But excusing them is the worst thing you can do it enables that behavior the best thing you can do to help is to show them that they don’t need to live this way and not tolerate bad behavior, just like with racists, bigots, etc

(not to be insensitive but it’s like those signs that say don’t feed the wildlife in parks because then they can become dependent on artificial food sources and lose their ability to survive the winter, excusing the behaviors and actions of individuals experiencing homelessness works much the same their behavior is accepted so they learn to live with it, if it wasn’t accepted they’d be forced to adapt and maybe utilize the resources made available to them, tough love)",t2_8dx3su3n,nibbaluver,0,1648188745.0,0,t1_i218h54,i218h54,False,adamwho,t3_tikobr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLO/comments/tikobr/did_anybody_lose_a_guy_named_marty_in_ag/,Did anybody lose a guy named 'Marty' in AG?,/r/SLO/comments/tikobr/did_anybody_lose_a_guy_named_marty_in_ag/i218h54/,1,r/SLO,0,1

"Cal Poly students generally secure apartments in the late winter and spring of the previous school year. Students still looking in August/September are stragglers, and likely will have trouble finding a place. I'm assuming your rental budget is higher than the average student's budget, which will make it easier to find a place. Some landlords also dislike renting to students, and while they can't outright discriminate against students, they'll impose qualifications that students are unlikely to be able to meet. So if you're not a student, or at least not a traditional late teens - early 20s student, you'll have an easier time finding a place.

">The median home price in San Luis Obispo County was $829,000 in February, according to Realtor.com, which was up about 11.1% year-over-year. SLO County also had one of the higher per capita personal income averages at $62,342, of the 205 small metros studied.

829k. 829,000 fucking dollars is cheaper than half the homes in the county. So if the average person wants a 20 year home loan for the middle priced house, (and it's probably going to be a 900k loan after interest and taxes/fees) then you have to spend 45k per year on your mortgage alone. That leaves you with barely more than 17 grand per year or about 1450 a month to spend on everything else such as food, property and sales taxes, gas and utility bills. Good luck raising a family on that. Of course in practice you'll never, ever get that kind of loan approved anyway so it's a moot point.

">Were the street open

Yes, I guess you would say they were open. The only thing blocking traffic were the mass of protestors and the line of cops.

>were you planning on walking with your children down the ramp onto the open active freeway?

Absolutely not. For several reasons. I don't think it is an effective form of expression for the valid frustration, and of course even if I was in favor of blocking the freeway there is no way in hell I would take my kids to do that.

>If so, how does that jibe with your comments about placing the cop's child at risk of physical harm?

It jibes because I would not put my children in that situation.

"Two moments stand out to me from when I went to a BLM protest in Paso. The ugliest and most relevant to this discussion is the blockade of the street as the marchers approached the freeway. The police were not provocative or overtly racist in behavior but it was telling that a young man of no more than 13-14 years of age was in that blockade. I assume it was a son of one of the officers.

I wonder what the conversations were like in that household? As a parent myself, I was very concerned for my teenage children who were with me. I coached them to be near the sidewalk in case a car drove through the protest. When we were stopped I wrangled them to the side so that we could more easily step out of harms way at the blockade. In the family of the child who was in the blockade, they apparently encouraged or condoned the intent of that young man to be at the focal point of conflict. I can't imagine wanting that for your child. 

Apparently the tradition that is important for many Paso parents to uphold is that of denying or ignoring the historical and current injustices that characterize white society's approach to race relations. So much so that they are willing to put their children's education and even physical well being at risk. 

In another episode a local officer was instructing personnel from the company I work for how to deal with an active shooter. This officer made the claim that the nut job that shot Paso police was a BLM activist. 

Even if this is true, the evidence is overwhelming that the offender in that shooting was someone with severe mental health issues, and these issues were the proximal cause of his activities. Instead of having an honest discussion, we were treated to a healthy portion of what my friend calls copaganda depicting dissent against police as an inherently violent, anarchic and anti-social activity.

As far as we've come as a nation from the worst episodes in our history, it is still clear we have so far to go.",t2_1p94f,tiktaalink,0,1647867404.0,0,t1_i1iwk8w,i1iwk8w,True,BlankVerse,t3_tis7p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLO/comments/tis7p2/this_california_wine_country_town_is/,This California wine country town is multicultural.

"You literally said ""I don't think about Bi as being unique or different in the same way that I think of L/G"" which is textbook bi erasure dude. We face significant though different problems than our L/G and straight peers

Like, as per https://ncadv.org/blog/posts/domestic-violence-and-the-lgbtq-community

> 43.8% of lesbian women and 61.1% of bisexual women have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime, as opposed to 35% of heterosexual women.

> 26% of gay men and 37.3% of bisexual men have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime, in comparison to 29% of heterosexual men.

I think the fact that we have *significantly higher* rates of being victims of sexual assault and intimate partner violence compared to other sexual orientations is *maybe* relevant to conversations. Erasing our existence does nothing to help us address *why* that is

You insulting me to my face for my identity and then saying I'm wrong for being upset about it? Like, come on dude.

"In Boy Scouts, we were on a trek in the Sierras and ended up hanging out with some rangers in the middle of nowhere.

Yep, all they could get on their banana ear'ed TV for some of the year was KSBY, and they *loved* them some Rick Martel. They were going bananas when we told them he moonlighted as a nightclub singer.

"My new next door neighbor is gay in a complex filled with long-term owners. Literally nobody cares (in a good way).

A married friend of mine was down here in SLO for a few years with his husband. They are not exactly in the closet (my friend radiates gay — he trails sparkles behind him \[and he's like 6'5""\]). I hung out with him at McCarthy's, SLO Brew's concert venue (when that existed), Jocko's in Nipomo, went to matinees, etc. Never an issue.

Now, bear in mind that ""bear"" is a decent way to describe my friends and I, so perhaps that had something to do with it, but when my friends decided to move back to SF it was due to the slower pace of life here, not anything to do with their sexuality. They liked it here.

Sounds like some dumb NIMBY shit if I’ve ever seen it. I generally hate the term, especially since I think it’s way overused, but I literally can’t think of what else to call this. I could understand if they wanted to simply change some aspects of the program, including certain months of the year, or certain days of the week where no permits were given (I don’t know the exact specifics of the program, but I presume you could get these any day of the week normally), But This just seems rather extreme also considering the following:

> According to the city manager, the RV spots generated more than $100,000 a year for the Morro Bay Harbor Department.

> The department is still facing a budget gap of $600,000- $1,000,000 a year.

People are going to likely still come, they’re just going to be breaking the law now. If you don’t offer a legal way for people to do things, they’re going to come into your neighborhoods and park, or do other things. I also literally don’t understand the person who thinks that more I also literally don’t understand the person who thinks that Morro Bay is a fishing village. I think most of us know it as a tourist location in today’s day and age. I think I might agree with someone that an expansion of the program to bring in hundreds of people per day to camp would be too much, but 19 spots isn’t going to Radically change your city, the city that again seems very rooted in tourism today.

">You clearly have a bias toward these people. You feel persecuted or some shit (“I’ll probably be downvoted for this…” in your initial comment).

This right here is exactly why I wrote the above statement.

Simply not knee-jerk believing people selling merchandise are literally criminals, for no other reason than the kind of merch they used to sell, is enough to bring completely baseless accusations. That's why I wrote what I wrote, and you provided a perfect example of it.

By church-based I meant church-based. There are plenty of Islamic, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, and other religious charities out there. In fact, Muslims are often the most charitable of any religion (it varies by place). People who choose to participate in organized religion tend to donate more to charity \[0\] than those who don't, and many of the pro-Trump people popularly discussed on this sub are churchgoers. It's therefore not out of the realm of possibility that these sellers donate to a religious charity called ""save the children"" (of which there are many). It's possible they donate to a secular charity of course, but the Venn diagram of prominent Trump supporters in SLO and churchgoers seems like it's got a pretty good amount of overlap, and religious philanthropists often donate to religious charities.

It's totally bizarre that simply not assuming criminal intent on the part of the sellers, and instead believing that just because they used to sell red hats doesn't automatically mean they're scamming people, somehow demonstrates ""bias towards these people."" How about just ""not being a dick?""

I don't think 40% of our countrymen hate everyone who isn't the same color as them, or con people out of money, or don't get vaccinated, or drive big trucks to spite leftists, or hate women / Jews / Muslims / etc., or believe everything Fox News says, or are pro-Russia, etc. In fact, I know precisely one (1) person who isn't vaccinated, and I don't know anyone at all who doesn't think the Russian Army deserves to get pounded into the mud on their way out of Ukraine, or that Putin deserves anything but a trial in the Hague for war crimes.

Even anecdotally, I am personally acquainted with too many people who simply aren't like that for this fantasy of all-non-Biden-voters-are-evil to be categorically true. The world really isn't that shitty. Get out of Reddit once in a while and you'll see that for yourself.

\[0\] — ""Studies have also found that ""individuals who are religious are more likely to give money to charitable organizations"" and they are also more likely to give more money than those who are not religious.\[12\] Among those individuals are members of American religious communities, about whom the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding conducted a recent study regarding philanthropic and charitable giving.\[13\] The study found that American Muslim donation patterns when it comes to charitable giving align mostly with other American faith groups, like Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish communities, but that American Muslims were more likely to donate out of a sense of religious obligation and a belief that those who have ought to give to those who do not. The study also found that most American faith groups prioritize charity towards their own houses of worship when it comes to monetary donations, and then other causes. Muslims and Jews contributed more than other religious groups to civil rights protection organizations, while white Evangelical Christians, followed by Protestants and then Catholics, were the most likely to make charitable contributions to youth and family services.""

"No, I explicitly covered donations. Allow me to quote my last line:

>I get why someone might feel misled, but OTOH if you wanted a pro-Ukraine shirt and you got a pro-Ukraine shirt (**assuming donations occurred in a manner consistent with their statements**), where's the problem?

And you're right, I am asserting good faith. Why not? Life is shitty enough without a priori deciding someone who sells red hats would never ever give money to charity. In the absence of evidence, either path is equally plausible.

In fact, I'd guess that they're probably more likely to give money to a church-aligned charity than the average Redditor, and a very large proportion of ""save the children""-type charities are church-aligned if not explicitly part of the organization (e.g. Catholic charities). As this sub has often pointed out, these are many of the same people who gather outside of SLO abortion clinics and pray. Some may recall the district attorney trying to get his wife permission to use a room in his offices for a bible study class, as well as the footage of him acting as lay clergy in a church in the North County. It's not a reach that they donate some amount to charity (even if it's only to look good).

They didn't lie about who they were: OP was clear about the fact that they didn't attempt to associate themselves with the march. Somebody tried to get them removed, which seems like a clue that their red hat past was discovered. The receipts had their merchant name right there up front.

"I don't know this for sure, but I assume it's because of the facility type. Instead of using traditional composting, SLO uses a dry anaerobic digester. It's actually pretty advanced, and the only facility of it's kind in the US (or at least it was a few years ago). We can use the gas generated from the digestion for electricity (e.g., powers the facility, sold back to PGE) and sell the rest of it as compost ([Source](https://www.sanluisgarbage.com/organics/dry-anaerobic-digestion/)). 

So while the bags are compostable, they're likely just incompatible with the equipment in the facility. Or don't break down fast enough.

Just like you can't put all recyclable material in the blue bin, since some might not work with our facility. Like shredded paper. It can be recycled, but since the pieces are small, they fall off conveyor belts and clog up the gears. A bit annoying, but not that hard to work around.

">I believe I covered that with their donation policy/history.

You didn't, though. What you did was make a statement asserting good faith: *""It's possible they've been sending some of their profits to a ""save the children"" fund the whole time. If they didn't donate anything that might be fraudulent, but it's unclear whether they do or not.""*

To which I'd ask—why in the world would someone afford a seller good faith if they aren't wholly transparent about who they are, at an absolute minimum??

As for *""but OTOH if you wanted a pro-Ukraine shirt and you got a pro-Ukraine shirt (assuming donations occurred in a manner consistent with their statements), where's the problem?""*

The reason your example about your friend's t-shirts doesn't work is because of the charity angle. As I said before, with obvious (or what should be...) obvious charities, people want their money to go to a cause. 

The shirt is not the end goal. Charity buys are just an excuse to donate money to a good cause with a nice bonus. This is exactly why these grifters are doing this! And it's fraud if they're intentionally making themselves look like something they're not in order to sell (for example: a nonprofit).",t2_101s3g,JonBenet_Palm,0,1646704818.0,0,t1_hzs9hab,hzs9hab,False,teripone,t3_t88dmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLO/comments/t88dmu/fraud_near_the_womens_rally/,Fraud near the women’s rally,/r/SLO/comments/t88dmu/fraud_near_the_womens_rally/hzs9hab/,2,r/SLO,0,2
"I believe I covered that with their donation policy/history. We just don't know where they give money (if they do), but that's not evidence of fraud. Further, we don't know if a MAGA hat seller is necessarily anti-UA. I think it's pretty clear that most conservatives are anti-Russia, given that even Tucker Carlson had to change his talking points and Fox gloats over Russian losses. Anecdotally, my conservative friends and family members are frustrated more can't be done against Russia without risking Article 5.

I think it's entirely possible this is an opportunist who donates a little money to a generic charity save-the-children fund because they always do and it looks good, and then prints and sells what they think will sell well. Kinda sketchy and disingenuous? Sure, but that's not really fraud, is it?

Very related example: I had friends with side hustles selling t-shirts in college (I wish I had gotten in on that), and they'd roll up to sporting events that didn't even involve where we went to school with t-shirts for both sides. They'd split the merch between two tables (each seemingly opposed to the other) and make bank in a night, not giving a flying f who won. When I think of merch dealers, I think of them.

I ask because it's unclear that you were actually defrauded. They were clearly unaffiliated with the march, so that's not misleading. We already touched on donations, and then there's the issue of whether you received your purchase.

Are you simply unhappy someone was once selling Trump gear and later they were selling Ukraine gear? *That's not fraud or grifting*. I understand feeling frustrated, but barring evidence this seems more like a learning experience than anything approaching a crime.

"Ah yes, Ukraine, the nazi country with a Jewish president, and all those ""war hawks"" supporting their aggressive actions towards Russia. After all, if Putin says his invasion isn't an invasion at all and is totally justified, it must be true, right?

Read some history. Read about Putin's consolidation of power. Read about Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008, and Euromaidan, the annexation of Crimea, and the war in Donbass. Ukraine is a free and sovereign nation that's currently being invaded in a fashion very similar(although much less effective militarily and politically) to Hitler's invasions of the late 1930s. It's unfortunate that you've been seduced by Putin's propaganda, but if you're willing to read some history and educate yourself, I think you'll find it's rather easy to deduce who is good and who is bad in this war.

"Okay actual 21 year old here who lives here now, here is the reality of it.

Cuesta is awesome. Amazing college, staff is super helpful all around, most professors are awesome with the typical duds, but no more (I would say even less) than usual. Cuesta has ratemyprofessor so check that out. Overall great experience, and also super inexpensive to actually attend.

As a 20 year old, there will be a good amount to do. Bonfires, parties, beach stuff, great food everywhere, cool touristy stuff.

When you turn 21 (not going to encourage illegalities, you know what you're comfortable doing and not doing, and of course hopefully understand the consequences if you get caught) a bunch more options. The bar scene is actually quite good, I'm super fond of the bars around here, with a few exceptions. People are all usually chill (its the ones that aren't from around here that aren't 9/10 times) and the bartenders are awesome, inexperienced drinkers included.

This place is INCREDIBLY expensive, everywhere is. Rent is expensive, food is expensive, gas is expensive. I would say if you're paying rent, you have to make a minimum of $3000 a month just to support yourself. An average ROOM here is around 1200-1400.

"Why would it confuse you? If an entire city is considered a ""desirable location"" then the market becomes something of a moot point in terms of what's needed for the health of the overall population.

I was born and grew up in SLO and lived in SLO county (Paso) until 2018, so I've seen the city evolve. I got an architecture degree from Cal Poly and I've been on the Planning & Zoning board where I now live (another region dealing with soaring housing prices) for the past three years, so I know a thing or two about housing. I can tell you that expecting the market to correct towards ideal conditions for the populace as a whole will be an infinity wait.

Cities need a mix of people, jobs, and levels of income to thrive, especially cities dependent on tourism for a significant part of their revenue (SLO falls into this). Think of how much service economy there is on the Central Coast, and how much most of those service employees make. It does no one any favors to price the region out for service economy workers. Doing so longterm creates walled gardens where businesses literally cannot succeed because they have no staff, or worse, those staff live in slums. (Waves at Seattle and LA.)

The market corrects for demand but that only takes into account the market in a vacuum.

"Thanks for your reply. Again I feel like it’s just a case of limited exposure here. For me, having lived in various bad places, I feel that crime/drug issues here are virtually nonexistent. The weekly rap sheets around here always give me a good laugh, compared to the ones in my old towns where I’d every time worriedly wonder, “what bullshit has gone down this week”, because there were real problems to worry about. People here are friendly, well-spoken, well-dressed & it’s probably one of the safer towns in the county statistically since they are doing much better with mitigating the homeless issue here! And I don’t notice any redneck-ish, trashy elements to the culture interacting with people, but I grew up in Texas so YMMV.

However I get why people who grew up here think this way. Atascadero is historically a lower-income town & there was a time in the past where it may have deserved its reputation. But it’s crazy to me that so many people still call this rapidly gentrifying town, with an average home price of 750K, by these outdated nicknames. It screams limited perspective to me, and I can deal with limited perspective if you’re not a dick about it.

"I grew up in bad & ugly, I lived in it for extended periods. I really doubt you’ve seen as “bad & ugly” as you think if you genuinely think Atascadero is bad… One big problem is that people seem to think their limited exposure to various places (passing through on vacation for a week or so) is a substitute for true real world experience. Like, “oh, I’ve seen it, so I know how it is & I can make apt comparisons!” 

But there’s tons of things that you wouldn’t pick up on without living there, or at least an extended visit, where you immerse yourself in the culture & other people. And I can definitively say that Atascadero’s culture is nothing like the trashy Southern/PNW towns I’ve lived in. There are highly educated, well-dressed & eloquently spoken people everywhere you look around here. Tons of downtown redevelopment projects going on involving public murals & stunningly beautiful, brand-new developments with fancy restaurants/snack spots, wine & rooftop bars, how exactly is that trashy? The only way it could qualify as trashy in 2022, is to someone who thinks trashy means not having beautiful landscaping around every corner & a constantly visible wealthy population.

"If your main goal is to go to community college then moving to SLO to go to Cuesta is probably not the best idea unless you have a parent or support system that will at the very least pay your rent. If you don't have that and do decide to come then its not really going to matter whats going on in SLO, you'll be working 30-40 hours a week + school to make ends meet. On top of that whats going on in SLO isnt worth taking out loans to make living easier for yourself. With that being said there is a lot of house parties and college type of events going on, and you dont have to be going to Poly to go to most of them. 

The weather is amazing and bc there is 2 colleges here there is a lot of people in your age range that want to have a good a time. Going to the beach, going on hikes/being outdoors, partying, going downtown many nights a week is what you'll come to expect if you are here to have fun. 

I grew up in SLO and very much enjoyed my late teens and early twenties in SLO. I also met a lot of people that moved to the area to go to Cuesta and now most of those people either stopped going to college to work full time and enjoy SLO or they decided it was to expensive and moved back home.
