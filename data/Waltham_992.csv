"I am. I’ll wait to see what the law department drafts. I don’t believe a city can prevent a single family homeowner from renting their property as long as it is rented as a single unit. To specify what that housing unit looks like opens up an opportunity to discriminate and enforce the ordinance in an arbitrary manner. I have been involved with harassment directed at minority tenants because neighbors didn’t like these people. In most cases, the city came down on the side of tenants only after I argued in their favor. I don’t know what would happen if a property owner didn’t side with the tenants and just wanted to placate neighbors. Many times neighbors don’t get along and tenants as opposed to home owners are easy targets. As I said, I’ll wait to see the proposed ordinance. This issue of renting to students has been an issue in Waltham for as long as I can remember. I don’t see how you can control the number of occupants simply by saying one person to a bedroom. Fact is, sooner or later, individuals will invite partners to cohabitate resulting in more than one person in a bedroom. Should be an interesting issue. I personally don’t rent to students for a variety of reasons although I have in the past. I rent exclusively to families and I can tell you, almost all are under housed.

"Astroturfing is when a state or national organization, usually with paid employees, pushes a political agenda but makes it appear to be grassroots-- that is, it appears that unrelated people in different communities are raising it at their local meetings. When this happens, the people raising the issue usually don't represent the majority opinion of the town, but they may get a lot of attention due to unusual antics, or the fact that they are showing up to a meeting that usually does not attract members of the public.

The best example of astroturfing on this diagram is Mass Against Mandates. This is a statewide group that set out to fight mask and vaccine mandates, but instead of presenting themselves as a statewide group, they created a Facebook group for each city and town in MA, then recruited local admins. At the Waltham School Committee meeting about masks there were local parents who spoke for and against masks, but there were more who spoke in favor. There were five people who were not from Waltham who entered the meeting without masks, several were being disruptive, and one of them was kicked out. If someone had not researched this afterward, it might have appeared that these folks represented a portion of our community. But someone found a video they posted online in which they said they had been asked to be there by Mass Against Mandates.

The recent attempt to ban LGBTQ books in Waltham is also an example of national and state groups drawing a lot of attention to an issue in our community, even though most people in our community do not consider it an issue. A paid employee of MA Family Institute, which is funded by national groups, started a Facebook group in which she promotes the idea that LGBTQ-inclusive content in schools is intended to ""groom"" students for sexual assault. Local parents such as Mrs. Arena then raise objections to content in their towns, so it appears to be coming from a local grassroots movement instead of the same orgs that have attacked LGBTQ people for decades.

Mrs. Arena's connection to SHFA may not be an example of astroturfing per se, but it's included in this network map because it's important to understanding Mrs. Arena's position on the book bans. She has repeatedly said that she is not anti-LGBTQ, she just feels the books are too explicit for teenagers. But she's also used the term ""grooming"" in discussing the books and has chosen to connect herself to some of the most notorious queerphobes in the state, and one of them built her campaign website.

The top row is national groups, the next two rows are state groups, and the third row is local. So ""White Nationalists"" are above ""SHFA"" to make the point that they are part of a dangerous national network.

The main point is that in MA, when we hear about bigotry or far-right activity, we tend to assume it is happening somewhere else. But state and national movements that may not seem to be well-established here have ways of influencing our politics that can be very effective if not enough people are showing up or getting involved in local meetings. So although most of us don't think of Waltham as a bigoted community, our politics can become bigoted if we don't pay attention.",t2_j16idnxi,macabeeI95,0,1647972920.0,0,t1_i1owuiw,i1owuiw,False,macabeeI95,t3_tid3qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tid3qg/how_the_right_astroturfs_your_local_school/,How the Right Astroturfs Your Local School Committee Meeting: A Waltham Example,/r/Waltham/comments/tid3qg/how_the_right_astroturfs_your_local_school/i1owuiw/,4,r/Waltham,0,4

"Hello! Thank you for posting!  
  
WWN is always jokey! WWN takes everything seriously!

WWN would not exist if both were not simultaneously true! WWN is a qubit! It is both funny and not funny, both lighthearted and deadly serious! At the same time! Unlike a qubit, measuring WWN does not determine our quantum state!  
  
The internet thinks George Bernard Shaw said ""Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh""! The internet also believes he said ""My way of joking is to tell the truth. It's the funniest joke in the world""! He also might have said ""When a thing is funny, search it carefully for a hidden truth""! We didn't realize how much we love George Bernard Shaw until the internet told us to dance with him!  ❤️💃🏽🕺🏽  
  
We also point to our short duration personal savior, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy! It is no surprise to us that his professional training as an entertainer and comedian provided the ideal experience to be exactly the leader he needed to be at the moment his country needed that leader!

"I thought the comment in the video about this part was condescending. It was mocking the councilor for his lack of knowledge and trying to ask questions to become more informed about it.

There's a reason to ask about the length of time an edible takes to ""kick in"" (e.g. on ""average"" alcohol takes a half-hour to kick in). Asking the question helps the councilor decide if it is worth considering. The lawyer does explain the issue in a knowledgeable way during the questions, which provides the information the councilor needed. It made the question's concern seem unnecessary. It was answered well and respectfully.

Asking questions to gather more information is an important aspect of any learning. The purpose of a hearing is to ask questions - sometimes questions you know the answer to. Mocking someone for trying to learn comes off superior and unkind. 

As for mocking his lack of edible use, it could mean a hundred things from he is a rule follower, to he's a stick-in-the-mud, to he doesn't like to imbibe in substances, to he's uber-religious, to he's in recovery, to he doesn't like jam bands, to he only smoked or took a brownie in the 80s, to he knows the answer exactly and just wants it on record, to he prefers the liquid stuff, to he prefers to bang hits of heroin on Mass & Cass.

When one pushes an agenda with respect for the unknowing it comes off as more considerate and the message you push comes across sincere.

The current Waltham administration has long had a policy of cutting to the bone any service it views as nonessential (to its being re-elected). We'd probably have a volunteer fire department by now if they didn't have a union. The services and enforcement you would like to see might not exist anymore. This is what we get when we sign up for 20 years of the same regime. Volunteer city cleanups feel good but are cosmetic. Real cleanup starts at the ballot box.,t2_7qw0a70t,invasive_species_16b,0,1647012940.0,0,t1_i091e9b,i091e9b,False,trewissick,t3_tbd41f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tbd41f/citywide_cleanup_day_april_23/,City-wide cleanup day April 23,/r/Waltham/comments/tbd41f/citywide_cleanup_day_april_23/i091e9b/,7,r/Waltham,0,7
"Sure I'm with you, but let's not pretend there's no downsides.  

First, not everyone likes to be recorded all the time.  

 Second, I don't know city hall technology terribly well, but I'm guessing there would need to be massive investments to make the meeting rooms tech friendly. Then you're also hiring a few IT staff to make sure everything is up and running for each meeting, moderating the Zoom, etc. Big cities like Waltham can afford that, but smaller towns in western MA? So making it a state requirement may be overly broad.   

Third, I'm pretty sure most if not all of these meetings are shown on public access television. So your point about awareness/access may be somewhat overstated. Of course post-facto watching is not the same as Zoom participation. But does a Zoom participant speaking their piece have a meaningfully louder voice than someone who calls/emails/writes letters to their representative and/or the mayor? Maybe - I don't know. But I do feel like people complain about there not being access in the way that they want the access to be (ie, Zoom calls between 6-8pm, which works for their schedule), and equate that to be no access, which I don't think is true. I think it's plenty easy to make your voice heard about Moody St without going to this meeting via Zoom.",t2_pvj95,tedious1,0,1647012538.0,0,t1_i090etz,i090etz,False,craZyJ617,t3_tb7ruy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tb7ruy/meeting_on_pedestrian_walkway_and_outdoor_dining/,Meeting on pedestrian walkway and outdoor dining on Moody St for 2022,/r/Waltham/comments/tb7ruy/meeting_on_pedestrian_walkway_and_outdoor_dining/i090etz/,6,r/Waltham,0,6

The second they try to increase your rate, cancel and go with the other one.

"This is going to have a huge impact on the area: I use these roads all the time and would also like to know.  

I’ve always thought this is a desperately needed set of improvements, although this time around, I see  changes that will impact me negatively:

- closing the 128N on-ramp from rt 20 west.  On the one hand poor visibility and almost non-existent merge lane makes it dangerous,  up on the other hand lots of people ise it.  I guess we’re supposed to use the new 128N on-ramp from rt 117, but I’d like to see corresponding local road improvements to support that much extra traffic.  Also, where does that stream of rt 20 traffic coming from Weston go to get on rt 128N?

- more traffic lights?  All around the rt 20 rotary?

"I have had mostly good experiences with my two. 

Waltham is well known for being good with kids with learning disabilities and also ""twice exceptional"" kids (for example, a kid gifted in one area and having a challenge in another). The schools my kids are at provide free breakfast and lunch, which takes so much stress off the family. Our kids have needed different extra supports at various times, and, so far, those have been provided immediately with no questions asked and no stigma. (No one ever plans for anything less than the easy kid and the perfect life circumstances. But it's so nice for the supports to just be there without having to fight for them.)

Waltham schools are ethnically and economically diverse and have a far lower rate of academic burnout and suicide than the high-pressure wealthier towns surrounding. I like those features of the schools.

"Seriously folks ride a bike.  Their our a few times a year that the trail in not clear. But not only is it cheaper it's faster. Inside of 2wks I was beating the train on average and the 70 is a night mare. BTW I weight in at 250lb. The bike path then up vaster st is a good route. And most of those Kendell jobs have showers for the most part.  Typically it took me 45mins, if you go this route here our my tips.

1. you don't need a fancy bike but something with gears is a good start
2. get paneers for a change of shirt an underware
3. every day for first 2mo just try to petal a 1% harder than you did day before
4. in the cold get cold weather gear cant afforded it duck tape the vents on your shoes etc.
5. believe this is worth it and set out 30mins early till your a pro.
6. You can do this rain or shine because your tough, you love your self and future generations don't need all this pollution

"I did this for several years -- there are multiple options:

1. Car -- find your way to Memorial Drive and go from there. From the south side, this is like 25 minutes and the worst part is getting out out of Waltham and onto Soldier's Field Rd. You'll need to have parking of course, but this is the fastest in my experience.
2. Commuter Rail from Waltham Center to Porter Square, Red Line to Kendall/MIT. If the train timing works out for you and the Red Line isn't on fire/broken/whatever this is about 35 minutes. Cons are that the commuter rail is relatively expensive and the schedule isn't always convenient.
3. Express Bus from Waltham (lots of stops on Main and Moody) to Boston then: a) Red Line to Kendall/MIT; b) walk to Kendall/MIT. This is slightly longer than #2 as you have to deal with Pike traffic on the bus. Walking from South Station to Cambridge takes about 30 minutes at a leisurely pace and is a nice way to get some exercise. The Red Line from South Station is an option for days when the weather isn't good or you need to get there a little faster.
4. \#70 Bus from Waltham to Central Square then: a) Red Line to Kendall/MIT; b) walk to Kendall MIT.  This is the least desirable option in my experience as the #70 bus is always really crowded and therefore really slow. However, if you find yourself coming home at night after the Express Buses stop this might be your only option.

The good thing about the commute from public transit is that there are multiple options for getting back and forth. Don't discount the Express Buses, sometimes they are more reliable than the commuter rail and the monthly passes are much cheaper.",t2_dr0d156l,One_Operation7983,0,1644445454.0,0,t1_hwabmyz,hwabmyz,True,chefkef,t3_sofv25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/sofv25/best_way_to_commute_from_waltham_to_kendall_square/,Best way to commute from Waltham to Kendall Square?,/r/Waltham/comments/sofv25/best_way_to_commute_from_waltham_to_kendall_square/hwabmyz/,1,r/Waltham,0,1
"Probably best you know now to not rely on the Boston public transit system 🤣 I would say, if it’s a train, I would often chose that over the car. Mostly because I loved the time to read or just have a second to myself, also because the road rage is real, and I hate dealing with it (from myself LOL, or others). Busses are almost never on the correct schedule, so be prepared for the time buff you’ll need for that as well. But in general … give yourself a 20 minutes buffer, meaning be at the station early, because on the days when the busses/ commuter rail trains aren’t late … they’re early 🙃 also the pass is pretty expensive, so see if work has either a discount or pays for it. Otherwise you’re looking at another 300-500 a month for the T pass. (Bonus is using it for not work things! Like going into the city for games, etc because fortunately most of our stuff is accessible via the T!) also probably never plan on using the transit system in the winter … just … naahhh",t2_7kp9mtm7,alittlelessnoisehere,0,1644443776.0,0,t1_hwa7a5r,hwa7a5r,True,chefkef,t3_sofv25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/sofv25/best_way_to_commute_from_waltham_to_kendall_square/,Best way to commute from Waltham to Kendall Square?,/r/Waltham/comments/sofv25/best_way_to_commute_from_waltham_to_kendall_square/hwa7a5r/,1,r/Waltham,0,1
"Before the pandemic I took the commuter rail to porter and the red line from porter to Kendall.  In the mornings, my commute was around 45 minutes from door to door.  My house is a 10 minute walk to the commuter rail station and work was directly above the Kendall station.  In the evening the trip was less streamlined given the redline isn't very reliable; however, I would take the express from porter to Waltham which saved substantial time.

That said, maybe once a month the redline or commuter line would fail and my commute would extend to 1 hr+.  In those cases, I would switch to the 70 from Central to Waltham.

"I used to commute this and your best option is to bike - when possible. Public transit is going to take about an hour. You would take the 70 into Central square and then take the red line. The train part will take about 5-10 minutes because it’s only one stop over.

Traffic is the big factor. When I would commute early in the morning around 7 AM it was a bit faster but not sure if you can control that.

The other factors that you should weigh in is parking. It’s really expensive to park in Kenmore but you can find some one hour spots and play that game a bit. Sometimes employers will reimburse you to get a MBTA pass so definitely look into that if you can.

"I meant ""just"" in the sense of ""the only"" -- that is, death is the only outcome of eating a poisoned rodent, rather than something like mercury or lead, which \*I think\* (but am not sure about!) is something that can build up in tissues over time, but which at small amounts isn't immediately lethal?  And like, rather than things like pesticides (which, again, build up and can cause things like weakened egg shells, impacting breeding success).   

Maybe a better way to have said it is, ""I thought that a raptor eating a poisoned rat automatically resulted in the death of the raptor, without any other possible outcomes"".

I totally agree with you, it's something that needs to be fixed.  But there's definitely a lot of things to tackle in order to fix it.  Sounds like something some  of us should be contacting the city about to see what can be done from that angle.  But I also think it would probably require a widespread educational campaign, because the city probably is not the only entity putting out poisons that are dangerous to raptors.  You have to reach the private citizens who might be doing it too.  (Although, I don't even know what regulations there are that people have to follow when it comes to putting out rodenticides or things like that.)

I'm more informed about efforts to address the problem of lead weights used in fishing in NH, because ingesting lead is quickly (although not immediately) lethal to loons.  And I know that effort is multi-pronged, partly involving attempts at legislation at the state level, and partly involving reaching individual fishermen with buy-back / exchange programs to substitute weights made of non-toxic materials.  I also know that there have been similar efforts with shotgun pellets, trying to replace those with non-lead shot. (That might also be aimed at raptors, because of raptors eating birds that have lead shot in them?)

Trying to address the use of pesticides and rodenticides has a separate set of challenges.  Because with things like lead used in hunting and fishing, part of the effort is introducing alternative, non-toxic materials that will still perform like the old lead shot.  With ""pest""-control, the challenge is answering the question of what alternatives people can use to control pest populations that won't be lethal to wildlife.  i.e. ""don't use rat poison"", but offering suggestions for addressing rat infestations, that kind of thing.

(Probably also a good idea to check to see whether organizations like Mass Audubon have efforts underway.)",t2_29yeuei5,eregyrn,0,1644014712.0,0,t1_hvmiah8,hvmiah8,False,austinmclark,t3_sj8lcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/sj8lcs/recent_captures_of_the_mt_feake_eagle/,Recent captures of the Mt Feake Eagle,/r/Waltham/comments/sj8lcs/recent_captures_of_the_mt_feake_eagle/hvmiah8/,5,r/Waltham,0,5

"I jogged through Mt. Feake during the spring/summer/fall (never really jogged before), but I always felt a bit bad about jogging by when someone was clearly grieving. Is it rude for me to jog in the cemetery? Should I try my best to avoid anyone who is grieving or is not that rude? I usually tried my best to keep breathing/key jingling to a minimum when passing by, and always tried to give space (always trying to be on the opposite side of the road).

I ask because I don't have any family members in cemeteries and as a 3 year old I ""played"" in the Mt.

"I really  like Sparkle Bright, on Moody Street.  They're near the corner of Moody and Chestnut.  There is a good-sized parking lot in the back (and an entrance to the laundromat from it).  And it's a large place.  (Unless the others have expanded, I think it's bigger than Bubbles or Crescent Street -- both of which I used in the past, and they're fine, don't get me wrong!)  So even when there are a number of people in there doing laundry, it's not hard to get a machine, or find a place to sit and wait.  (And it's easy to go wait in your car if you want, since it's right there.)  It's always been clean and well-lit when I've used it.

By the way, there is also a Bubbles on the southern end of Moody Street, on the corner of Wadsworth.  grizzlyadams33 is talking about the one up on Main St. / Rt. 17, near the shopping center with the Five Guys etc.  The Bubbles on Moody also does have parking in the back.

"At this point, most of the major roads with sidewalks are in good shape, especially in and around the schools and colleges.

When it's heavy snow I stick to Brandeis Loop Rd. (1.1 Mile) Mt. Feake Cemetery (\~2.0 miles all the way around), Border Rd, and Comm Ave as they're well plowed very quickly.   
Hypothetically Main St. and Moody St. are supposed to shoveled out, but that's rare. Shockingly, the Prospect St. Bridge was clear so you can connect up and loop the Watch Factory and the Cemetery as well. 

Yesterday with a couple of days of melting, I was able to do a substantial loop around the city with minimal snowbank dodging.

"My family has gone to eastern clothing in Watertown for years, however - and this is going to sound crazy - but I had a really solid experience at the mens warehouse… here’s my story, and why I’m happy to do business with them..


So, I used to live in Los Angeles, while I was living there, I met my now wife, and while we lived in LA, we got married in Lincoln, MA.  I ended up going to mens warehouse for my suit - and at the time, they had some deal - buy one suit for a thousand bucks, get an additional for free.  My thought was - well I can get a wedding suit, then a more formal one for wakes/funerals etc.  bought my two suits, but only had my wedding one altered.  Long and the short - 6 years later, we’re living in MA, and I was asked to officiate a wedding ceremony for a friend.  I thought “Perfect, I’ve got a suit that would be great for this - just need to get it altered.”  Well, I tried it on before bringing it in, and there was no way this thing was going to fit.  So I went to the Mens Warehouse in Newton(I think it was newton) and I explained the situation, I played it cool and said “I got this a little while ago… and I needed to see if I could get it altered, or even exchange it - it’s never been worn” he finds the receipt and goes “a little while ago? You brought this over 5 years ago on the other side of the country!” We had a little chuckle, and he goes - “given the time that’s passed, I can’t refund you the amount, but I can give you store credit.” Not a problem - I needed a suit anyways, to my shock he gave me $850 in store credit, which was what the suit retailed for.  I even mentioned I got it as part of a deal - and he said “I’m not worried about that.”  They had a deal at the time for a “Custom suit - with free alterations for life” it was $1000, I bought it right away, I’ve since had it altered - with no issues - and it looks great to this day.  

I’m sure there’s nicer Mom and Pop places, but I really can’t say enough good things about the experience.",t2_124qvi,cameronsounds,0,1643060498.0,0,t1_hu2oj7h,hu2oj7h,True,[deleted],t3_s9imwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/s9imwi/looking_for_a_suit/,Looking for a suit,/r/Waltham/comments/s9imwi/looking_for_a_suit/hu2oj7h/,1,r/Waltham,0,1

McGuire's in Easton has great wings - I had them last night when down there with friends. They are one of the few that actually include the carrots, celery, and chunky (CHUNKY) bleu cheese.

The S&S in Inman Square Cambridge used to have great wings - but I have not visited in \~ 5 years.

People say that Buff's Pub in Newton Corner has great wings - your mileage may vary.

A few years later (January 2021) we had some leakage issues with water getting in around some of the new nails from the replacement slates. O’Lyn took no responsibility and gave us the same price quote for another repair.

"Skate sharpening: just go to the rink on Totten Pond.  

My go-tos for stuff:   
Tricorn Sports on Lexington St in Lexington. A smaller shop and a bit pricier. But very convenient. Not sure if they have used stuff, but they're a good spot for tape, a new stick if you need one quickly, and smaller stuff like cups or elbow pads. Also a great place if you want to support small, locally owned businesses. And they have sharpening.    

For used stuff, Play It Again Sports on River St. Obviously it's hit or miss depending on what you need. But they've been in business for decades, so they're solid.

"Unfortunately I didn’t deal with retention/attrition so I can’t really speak to overall success, just admissions.

Thinking about my own experience through undergraduate and graduate school most people who dropped out freshman year (which is when most people drop out) didn’t develop the skills or independence they needed in order to manage all their commitments (drinking!, school, work, friends, healthy sleeping/eating habits, extracurriculars).

People who dropped out later (including in graduate school) usually did so because they realized they weren’t actually interested in their chosen area of study, they realized there weren’t enough opportunities in the field, or other big life decisions took precedent (like caring for family members, a spouse’s job, or starting a family).

I’m not convinced that a more or less competitive high school would make much of a difference for either of these. Going in with a bit of AP credit might help a bit in terms of time management, though it often means jumping into harder classes right off the bat which could be demotivating.

Middle school introduced more scheduled based classes and taught us to be more independent of our own work more. McDevitt was an interesting experience personally. im not the brightest student i did go to Merrimack College. 

I did feel underprepared for college i will say but that was mostly on my own personal lack of preparation. the surrounding communities also are much richer like Wayland, Newton, Sudbury, Chestnut Hill, Weston and Sudbury. 

The high school at the time was very diverse i enjoyed my time as a student and genuinely feel the experience had with the school helped me become who I am today.

The rest of the sports teams are pretty universally bad. Often the best students who get into Ivys are first generation immigrant kids. These kids are inspiring, but rare.

"My children have been in Waltham from Day 1, all the way into the high school. We've had a really good experience at each level. The teachers and staff seem very thoughtful and are very communicative. My kids seem to be doing very well in school with lots of opportunities in terms of academics, extracurriculars, etc and have a solid social experience IMO. 

As I tell everyone though, the school is a small piece. Parent engagement with your child and their educational experience is key.  By this I mean, keep it simple. understanding what is going on, where to point your child if they need help, encouraging the right habits, the simple act of asking your child what they're doing in school today, that's a huge advantage.

The only negative, and I think this is everywhere is the parents who over do that last piece and turn into helicopters. By that, I mean calling / emailing the teacher daily, or complaining about the curriculum and how it's being taught. You'll see this at the elementary school level, especially. Apparently their 3-5 years of parenting have offered them the amazing ability to understand all that goes into elementary education and overrule the educational experience that they have have been delivering for decades.

"We’ve got two kids in the school system. As other commenters have said it’s not as competitive as neighboring towns but it’s also diverse ethnically and economically. 

As far as quality of education we’ve been more than pleased. Both of our kids learned how to read and learned basic math in kindergarten or first grade. 

Also the data pretty clearly shows that parental involvement is the primary predictor of education performance. So if you’re involved as a parent your kids are going to have a great time.
