"Thank you for sharing your experience! It definitely helps consider the mall kiosk option a bit more. I too had my ears pierced by my parents at 3 months old but it was done at my pediatrician’s office. Never had any problem with those. 

As an adult, I had a bad experience when I had additional piercings done at the mall (specifically Claire’s). My cartilage piecing in particular was improperly placed and kept getting infected years after I had got it done.

"I had my daughter's ears pierced at a young age because everyone kept thinking she was a boy.  This was the early 80s.  I was only 20 and that was my best reasoning at the time.  She's never regretted having her ears pierced. 

My youngest daughter never got the ""little boy"" remarks and I didn't have hers pierced until she was old enough to ask for it. 

Both were done at a mall kiosk and neither experienced problems. 

Travel back in time to the 70s, when I was 15 and wanted my ears pierced but my parents wouldn't take me.  I worked for a doctor at that time who happened to do ear piercings, so I had them done by him.  They're uneven.  He told me to just tilt my head a little and no one would notice.  So yeah.

"Yes, there is no dispute that Mr. Oulson threw the popcorn. Mr. Reeves testified that Mr. Oulson struck him *before* that, which is clearly supported by the video of the illuminated object in the security footage and the fact that a bag of popcorn would not have had the mass to cause the irritation/soreness to Mr. Reeves eyes that were protected by his glasses. The totality of the evidence allows us to draw the conclusion that it was indeed Mr. Oulson's phone that impacted Mr. Reeves and is shown in the video landing at his feet, especially considering that the State had no rebuttal to the video that wasn't laugh out loud dumb. 

I'm glad that you were willing to admit that your feelings on guns is driving your opinion. I will at least give you points for honesty, even if I think it is rather odd to let those opinions dictate your opinion on the matter rather than the facts and the law. I hope in the time since you've moved here, you've learned that unless you and your family are the type to respond to disagreements with physical violence, your chance of being the victim of a shooting is *incredibly* small. The one commonality in these questionable self defense shootings (Zimmerman, Drejka, Reeves...etc) is that the person who was shot was the initial physical aggressor. I can empathize with how shocking that must have been though, and sincerely hope you and your family have found peace in the time that has passed. 

I think it's important that we take a step back here and remember that to secure a conviction, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person, viewing the events through Mr. Reeves perspective, would *not* have been in fear of death or great bodily harm. While we can debate over whether Reeves felt that way or if such feeling was reasonable, surely we can agree that the State didn't meet the burden needed to convict, can we not? 

Also, I absolutely agree with you that Mr. Reeves handled this matter very poorly and could have done many, many things better or different. 

Lastly, I don't think I am at all superior to you save for the fact that I was/am willing to take a 2nd look at my own opinions and engage in some introspection.",t2_qtkh1,RockHound86,0,1646852045.0,0,t1_i007z4s,i007z4s,False,Virtual-Worker922,t3_smvnqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/,Lawyer Reacts: Curtis Reeves Trial Begins Today,/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/i007z4s/,1,r/tampabay,0,1
"We knew he threw popcorn, so it's likely he was hit with the popcorn box/bag/whatever, as you can see in the video that he did grab it and throw it back at him pretty quickly (and one would expect, with force). Beyond that, they did not prove that Oulson threw the phone at him, only that it was on the floor.

While I don't really need to explain any part of my opinion to you - yes, I believe Reeves' initial harassment (and the hypocrisy of it) of Oulson is important. It's most certainly not uncommon for the average Karen to pretend they are the victim in a situation they've escalated. 

Yes, my belief that guns are nothing but bad news plays heavily into my feelings on the case. As does the fact he was not permitted to have it in the theatre demonstrating he is the kind of person who clearly believes the rules do not apply to him, but do apply to everyone else. This incident happened the week I moved to Wesley Chapel from a country with very, very limited gun ownership and it triggered a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety in myself and my family abroad who (not experiencing shootings as commonplace) questioned our decision to come here (as did I). While it's small and would sound insignificant to someone else, it wasn't at the time for us- so for that reason this incident has continued to stick out to me. 

Nothing you've said and nothing I've read has given me any change in my original opinion. Even if he had thrown his phone at him (I don't feel that was proven, at all), I don't believe that is cause to shoot someone. The only reason Oulson is dead, is Reeves. While reactive abuse is still abuse, and I don't condone Oulson throwing popcorn or anything else at Reeves, I don't think the court established in any way that Reeves was in any real danger, apart from Reeves saying that he ""felt"" he was. As a cop, he should have been able to handle this situation a lot better (even just by moving away, but really he could have just shut up and minded his own business), and certainly shouldn't have been using a gun in a movie theatre- but instead of holding cops to higher standards, we regularly lower the bar instead. 

Either way- I wasn't the one who came back to this one month old thread to purposely antagonize you and I have no desire to continue this back and forth, as I mentioned before, especially now that you've taken to personal attacks to attempt to make yourself look superior to me.",t2_pwgoe,thebohomama,0,1646850044.0,0,t1_i003152,i003152,False,Virtual-Worker922,t3_smvnqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/,Lawyer Reacts: Curtis Reeves Trial Begins Today,/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/i003152/,1,r/tampabay,0,1

"Ahh, so your line about what the ""court records"" established was complete bullshit, and you were simply sharing what you *wanted* the court records to show. I'm glad we established that fact, lest someone lurking here get the idea that the State had any rebuttal to the video beyond their profoundly moronic claim that the illuminated glow wasn't Mr. Oulson's phone but rather a reflective strip on Mr. Reeves shoe. 

And if the importance of Reeves' hypocrisy is so important, why are you having such trouble elaborating on it? Because you know that as far as the legality goes, it is irrelevant. 

I'm not surprised that you cherry picked that portion of DeJonge's testimony. After all, when the facts aren't on your side, just ignore them, right? That way you don't have to address the fact that Reeves complained of soreness/irritation to at least three different people including DeJonge, and two people (Todd Koenig and Susan Miller) testified that there was redness around the same area DeJonge had inspected, and Susan Miller took photos of said redness. Interestingly enough, Susan Miller testified that she saw the redness around Mr. Reeves eye on her own and that it wasn't pointed out to her by anyone. 

Also, Mr. Reeves testified that he was definitely struck by Mr. Oulson. He stated that he didn't know if it was by an object or by a fist, but that he was definitely struck. 

So just to recap:

- *something* knocked Mr. Reeves glasses ""askew""
- *something* caused Mr. Reeves to feel soreness/discomfort/irritation in his left eye
- *something* caused redness to the area around Mr. Reeves left eye
- *something* illuminated is shown on film striking Mr. Reeves in the head area and coming to rest at Mr. Reeves 
- Mr. Oulson's cell phone was found at Mr. Reeves feet, consistent with the video. 

By any objective basis, that is a pretty compelling totality of evidence supporting Mr. Reeves claim. To explain them away in totality requires gold medal level of mental gymnastics. 

Lastly, I think it is quite ironic that you bring up the fact that neither one of us are going to change our views, because on that point you are demonstrably wrong. Feel free to look through my previous posts here and on other forums; I was originally quite skeptical of Mr. Reeves claims and thought there was a very real chance that the court would convict him. My opinions changed as I watched the trial and it became clear that the State not only couldn't meet the burden of proof, they were actively trying to obfuscate on the fact that Mr. Oulson was indisputably the unprovoked physical aggressor--which the defense established with clear and convincing evidence. 

You--on the other hand--had clearly made up your mind before the trial even began based on your political and social beliefs. You make no qualms of the fact that you are contemptuous of police officers, firearm owners, and those of a certain political ideology, and admit that you have some sort of unspecified emotional connection to this case. When the court didn't give you the result you believed was right, your response wasn't any sort of introspection, but rather to insult and demean six people (a whole county, actually) whom you had never met and knew nothing about other than the fact that they possess some of the qualities you subjectively find contemptuous. 

In short, the only person here who isn't willing to change their views is *you*, not me. It's a shame that you have such an overinflated view of your intellectual ability, thus I doubt that introspection will ever happen for you.",t2_qtkh1,RockHound86,0,1646847743.0,0,t1_hzzx83n,hzzx83n,False,Virtual-Worker922,t3_smvnqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/,Lawyer Reacts: Curtis Reeves Trial Begins Today,/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/hzzx83n/,0,r/tampabay,0,0
"Yes, I read transcripts of the trial, which are court records. There's quite a bit of discussion about this extremely poor video, too. I don't really need to elaborate on the importance of Reeves being a hypocrite, given for the average person the importance would be obvious. This incident had a lot of significance to me at the time (not because I know these people).

""DeJonge said Reeves again complained he believed he had something in his left eye. DeJonge said he removed Reeves' glasses and looked at his eye. He said there was no redness, objects, laceration or abrasions. He said he then used sterile water to flush Reeves' eye two or three times... DeJonge was asked if he noticed any bruises, redness or lacerations of any type on Reeves' face as he flushed out his eye. DeJonge testified that he did not."" Several testimonies about there being no injury. I think you happen to the one who thinks they can steamroll me. Oh poor Mr. Reeves, with his... ""something in his eye"" and no bruising, redness, or otherwise. Reeves didn't even know if anything or what hit him if it did. He had no ""injury consistent with being struck"". Stop. 

The testimony of the cop who was paying attention to the interaction was particularly telling to me (and telling about what big liars Mr. and Mrs. Reeves are).

"So Mr. Reeves was admittedly a hypocrite. What does that matter? Please, elaborate on the importance of this because I'd truly like to understand your perspective. 

I'm also quite perplexed at how you see Mr. Reeves having his firearm as the cause of Mr. Oulsons death. Sure, at a basic level, if Reeves hadn't been armed, then Mr. Oulson wouldn't have been shot and killed, but those kind of 100% either/or statements can be true for just about any scenario. Do you not think it is more accurate to say that because Mr. Oulson decided to commit unprovoked felony battery, someone died? 

As to your ""judge, jury, and executioner"" argument, please lay out the ways that differs from a lawful use of lethal force in self defense, lest we all start to think you are throwing around emotionally charged buzz words without understanding what they mean.

Your comment about ""court records"" is beyond laughable. You apparently mistook me for someone that you could steamroll with your bullshit. The only ""court records"" are the evidence collected and the witness testimony. I don't believe you ever actually bothered to watch the security footage (can be viewed [here with annotations](https://youtu.be/kcLAM5_HElw?t=644)) because it indisputably refutes your ridiculous claim that the phone fell when Mr. Oulson stood up. A phone doesn't fall by launching itself at another person, then tumbling down their lap and landing at their feet. I'd be remiss if I *again* didn't point out that Mr. Reeves had an injury on the left side of his head consistent with being struck, and I've yet to hear any plausible explanation for how Mr. Reeves suffered that injury if it wasn't caused by Mr. Oulson. 

Mr. Reeves has claimed since day one that he was struck by Mr. Oulson. The fact that he didn't know if it was with a fist or a phone is really quite unimportant, though you seem to think that this lack of knowledge on his part is evidence of anything.",t2_qtkh1,RockHound86,0,1646783186.0,0,t1_hzwlxwr,hzwlxwr,False,Virtual-Worker922,t3_smvnqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/,Lawyer Reacts: Curtis Reeves Trial Begins Today,/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/hzwlxwr/,0,r/tampabay,0,0

"Mr. Reeves had no business having a gun in a place that prohibited it- and then he had the audacity to harass someone for not ""following the rules"" (rules that are loosely enforced and everyone breaks during previews, that causes no one harm) while breaking a very big rule of the theatre himself- a rule that, because he broke it, someone died.

Mr. Reeves is no longer a police officer, and police officers are also not permitted to play judge, jury, and executioner (though they do). The jury bought his 'poor old man was scared' act, likely threw in some gun-rights-stand-your-ground options, and let this guy get away with murder.

And, while I have zero interest in continuing this back and forth- court records established that it's unlikely a phone is shown in the video, Mr. Reeves himself didn't even see this happen, he claims he was hit and himself didn't even notice the popcorn thrown at first- he probably felt the damn popcorn or bag. Oulson did not hit him, nor throw his phone- reality is it likely fell on the floor (as they were sitting in front of them after all) when he stood up.

"The term ""numpty"" is used in the same colloquial fashion as the word ""retard"" and you know it. I don't have any issue with that as I'm not above using that sort of language myself when warranted, but the way you try to act as if you aren't doing the same thing is absolutely laughable. Unfortunately, it looks like you picked up some of those narcissistic traits yourself, but I'm not here to psychoanalyze you. 

You're either misinterpreting or deliberately misconstruing Vivian Reeves testimony. I watched all of her testimony, and she testified that once Chad Oulson stood up, she either turned away and/or closed her eyes and didn't look back until after the shot had been fired. She didn't see anything consistent with self defense because she quite literally saw nothing at all. And again, her testimony on that point has been 100% consistent for *eight years*. I'm also curious why you don't seem to want to address Nicole Oulson doing her best Sgt. Schultz impression on cross examination. Unlike Vivian Reeves, she was *clearly* covering up for her spouse and was very effectively impeached on that point. 

You continue with this narrative that Reeves shot Oulson because of popcorn, yet that has been pretty conclusively disproved. Reeves stated a mere hour after the shooting that Oulson initially struck him in the left side of the face *before* the popcorn was thrown. The defense proved ample evidence supporting this claim with the injury to Mr. Reeves left eye/temple area and the security footage that showed what clearly looked to be Mr. Oulson throwing his phone at Reeves and the phone coming to rest at his feet. You do yourself a disservice by parroting such a silly, half baked narrative. 

Also, you clearly misunderstand that lawfully deployed lethal force in defense of self is *not* punishment, but protection. Chad Oulson didn't die because he was being punished for his behavior. He died because he committed, **completely unprovoked**, an act of felony battery that placed his victim in reasonable fear of death or great bodily harm and his victim lawfully deployed lethal force to terminate the threat. 

I can't even fathom the ignorance (or more likely, cognitive dissonance) required to believe that two men seperated by thirty some years of age and a host of health issues were comparable foes simply because they were both large men. This smacks of the kind of sheltered ignorance that can only come from someone who has never had to engage in a physical altercation. 

You refuse to accept Mr. Reeves behavior as okay, but I'm quite curious why you are willing to accept Mr. Oulson's behavior as okay. How can you condone such behavior when it could have seriously injured or even possibly killed Mr. Reeves?

"""Retard"" is not an appropriate word either, and I didn't and do not use it. I have a problem ""narcissist"" being thrown around as someone who has suffered from narcissistic abuse. A numpty is the word for an ignorant person.

She did conflict with her husband, she said she saw nothing to indicate he acted in self defense. She said, and I quote, “No. I wish I had,” she said. “I wish I had seen everything.” She's basically saying nothing to avoid lying and not incriminate her husband. There's zero way for you to not know what's going on sitting beside someone in a movie theatre who claims to have had this huge blow out with this huge intimidating man being held back by his wife from knocking him out. That's bullshit, she knows it, she refuses to perjure herself, so she said she didn't see anything. It's clear as day. 

I don't have any anger problems and I have a hard time being confrontational, but I would have been super annoyed if someone gave me a hard time about texting during previews, went off to complain to a manage, told me they did, and continued to bother me. She said he was quick to anger, so instead of letting it go, after the final time this guy continued to provoke an interaction with this guy, he turned around and threw his popcorn at him. Bad behavior? Sure. Death penalty? No.

His abilities to do things and his size absolutely count here. My own father who suffers disability was approximately this same size at 71, and I can't imagine him saying someone scared him so much he shot them, and he's not an ex-cop trained in dealing with these types of situations. He should have known better as a human being, but 1000% as a cop. 

I have several ideas of how the jury got where they did. You could say ""I'm not sure if he did the right thing or not"" and of course, that's a acquittal, however- that's not the only factor at play, but I've already mentioned them in my last comment.

I simply refuse to accept this behavior as okay and without a gun in his hand, no one would have been dead. There's no reason to believe this guy would have hit him or hurt him or killed him, and that's the whole point. 

**Finally, COBB THEATRE had signs that PROHIBITED guns from their premises. So, tell me, it's okay for this guy to bring a gun into the theatre when it's clearly displayed they are not allowed, but texting during previews because the screen asks people to put away their phone............ that's not okay. Rules for ye, not for thee. The law may say legally, not a problem- but private businesses can refuse service and have their own rules (texting during previews is also not against the law). I think it was far more rude to kill a husband and father than it was to text during move previews.**

**This guy just believed rules don't apply to him and the ""justice"" system just confirmed that.**",t2_pwgoe,thebohomama,0,1646420803.0,0,t1_hzcoc98,hzcoc98,False,Virtual-Worker922,t3_smvnqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/,Lawyer Reacts: Curtis Reeves Trial Begins Today,/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/hzcoc98/,1,r/tampabay,0,1
"Oh, so you have no problem at all calling people a name that is synonymous with *retard*, but you get offended when someone calls *your* actions narcissistic? I wonder if you’re aware enough to realize how narcissistic that behavior is in of itself. 

As for the rest of your post…

- Vivian Reeves testified that she either turned away from or closed her when the physical confrontation began. She’s been consistent on this since the beginning and none of her testimony contradicted anything her husband said. 

- Why haven’t you mentioned Nicole Oulson’s testimony? Of the two wives, her testimony was far more impactful as the defense shredding her credibility was the first big turning point for Reeves. She came across as clearly tailoring her testimony to benefit her late husband. 

- The fact that Curtis Reeves was a large man is pretty irrelevant to his ability to withstand or inflict physical harm given his age. 

- How telling that you refuse to even consider that maybe…just maybe…the jury was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt and instead acquired Reeves because of what he had done in his life.",t2_qtkh1,RockHound86,0,1646419230.0,0,t1_hzcka3b,hzcka3b,False,Virtual-Worker922,t3_smvnqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/,Lawyer Reacts: Curtis Reeves Trial Begins Today,/r/tampabay/comments/smvnqt/lawyer_reacts_curtis_reeves_trial_begins_today/hzcka3b/,1,r/tampabay,0,1
"Firstly, it's really gross to throw around the term ""narcissistic"" so casually. 

Meanwhile, this guy's wife didn't even corroborate his own testimony sitting right next to him. In fact, none of the witnesses that testified did. That doesn't matter though, because at the end of the day, some people want gun rights and they want gun rights to always win. And when you have an even more elderly dude on the stand (even though the day before he went to the movies he was hunting, archery from a tree stand no loess), ex-cop, even more of a hard-on for him. Sorry but, his demographic is 100% why he got away with murder here. If he felt so ""threatened"" by this big man (Reeves himself is 6'2"" and nearly 300lbs at the time.......) who did not take kindly to being harassed over his phone during previews, why did he continue on and on with him? Why not shut up, or move? Like, maybe stop harassing someone who says to get out of their face. Wife says this guy didn't even turn around until right before the shooting occurred.

"* pizza and BBQ: find a good chain near you that you like, and branch out from there- not everyone that has a pizza/BBQ place here actually cooks *good* pizza/BBQ and having a known good chain for consistency helps.

* you’ll never get a solid answer on the beaches. To me, gulf coast > Atlantic coast.

* Non primary care docs- everyone is fucking moving here, make your appointments as soon as possible, lots of dentists booked anywhere from 30 to 120 days out 

* LGBTQ friendly PCP- best of luck in Hernando. I’ve had decent luck in Pasco (county neighbor) but pales in comparison to Hillsborough county. If you’re healthy and only go for regular checkups, consider Metro Health in Ybor.

* I really don’t think there’s a bad phone network  in FL. I’ve had all of them except ATT over the years and they are all the same in-state.

* you know what my favorite Asian place is after 12 years here? Fucking **Panda Express.** but when I actually want something good, Yummy House in Tampa, Hawkers in St. Pete. Two actual good Non-sushi Asian restaurants. 

* reptiles like it here. You’ll also see some big ass toads and frogs. We have a tree frog that lives on our front door (so, actually a *door* frog.)

* Just… if you’ve got a gator close enough to interact with, call animal control. Everyone’s luck with this is different, I think the closet I’ve ever been to one was maybe 50’ feet and that thing didn’t give a shit about me. You will, more likely come closer than that with critters like armadillos, which, *do not fuck with the armadillos. Dirty fuckers.*

"You don't say why as a young person you ended up in Spring Hill. Over time I think you may be disappointed. LGBTQ+ friendly is going to be a tough one. My parents (and where I grew up) is just a bit further north and good doctors period can be hard to find (so many retirees, they churn them through like an assembly line). And you aren't in a spot that's real convenient for frequent visits to Tampa.

You'll get used to the lizards, there are so many they might as well be as common as an ant. 

Definitely forget the beaches, unless you are really into them. Springs are where it's at. Seven Sisters, Three Sisters, Rainbow Springs, are all close and tend to be a little less busy Weeki Wachee (they have a limit so you don't want to show up too late). 

Publix is your best bet (the only other real grocery store you'd go to is Winn-Dixie, which I don't recommend- Aldi is your best spot for good quality, affordable groceries)- although I grew up thinking Publix was the best grocery until I started visiting some other places (like Wegmans, Ingles, King Sooper) and realized it's not as special as I thought it was.

"I’m down in Pinellas so a lot of these I can’t answer but in regards to Alligators specifically, please don’t swim in any pond or lake, like ever. Always assume that any body of water you are going into (with the exception of salt water) is going to have an alligator in it. Alligators are EVERYWHERE down here, they are apart of the landscape and should always be respected. 

If you have small pets, please do not let them outside unattended for long, especially at night. Coyotes are absolutely everywhere as well and are extremely bold when it comes to snacking on peoples cats and other critters. I had indoor/outdoor cat years ago that fell victim to coyote predation and have since refused to let any future cats to go outside, ever. Friend of mine just had her entire chicken coop slaughtered as well. 

Snakes are a non-issue, in my opinion. Yes, you have some venomous ones to look out for (rattlesnakes, cotton mouths, etc) but they keep to their own. 

Publix is amazing but pricey. We try to stick to bogos when we can, but there are plenty of times we’ve stopped in for a few items and have left spending $60+ on like 5 things, lol. But shopping there really is a pleasure, so no complaints here. 

The little brown lizards you will see literally everywhere are Cuban Anoles. They are an invasive species and have essentially run out the natural anole species, the green anole. Unfortunately, because of our subtropical climates, lots of invasive species have made their homes here and are flourishing. Pythons and iguanas being the most well known, lionfish out in our gulf waters are a bit of problem as well. 

When storm season starts and a storm approaches, don’t panic. You’ll soon notice us native Floridians don’t seem to care all too much about storms pop up until the last moment (and even then we are stocking up on the alcohol more than anything, lol). The path of a tropical storm system isn’t truly set in stone until it’s basically making landfall (just look at Hurricane Charley years ago), so until it’s knocking on your door, there’s really no need to buy up half the store and panic like a lot of new residents tend to do. Do look into putting together a small kit to keep in storage, for example, we have a small kit with flashlights, batteries, candles, portable a/c and more than likely we will be getting a small generator this year. Oh, and heads up, summertime thunderstorms can be absolutely gnarly, a lot of times worse than some tropical storms I’ve been through. Florida lighting is no joke, so if you hear thunder, be mindful.

For snakes and alligators, common sense applies. I won't swim in anything not the gulf, bay or river/spring and in the rivers and springs I stay well away from any coves outside of the rivers flow. Don't bother them and they typically won't bother you.

"I love to hear this, but this is not always the case. In my own experience, in the experience of my family and friends, and in so many situations I see online, members of the queer community face issues with finding doctors because many are unfamiliar with or completely unaware of a lot of LGBTQ+ issues.   
Recognizing pronouns and preferred names is a huge step, and I'm seeing more and more practices even put that sort of stuff right onto intake forms. Even with my current GP, she is wonderfully respectful and open minded, however knew little about PreP or even to whom to refer me me to for more information. I could go on and on about this, but I encourage you to look at some articles about this seeing that you work in the industry. Members of the queer community, myself included, are often hesitant to disclose their sexual orientation, or even seek medical care in general due to the potential of bias.

"Biggest concern for outdoors is, unlike traditional boats, these are made of plastic and not multiple lay-up layers of fiberglass. Even if fiberglass the lay-up is considerably thinner. Storing outside, with no coverage invites deformity even in the short term. A cover can protect to a certain extent but wouldn't be the best choice as again UV damage or moisture damage from moisture being trapped underneath.

A regular storage unit or outside trailer type storage just defeats the purpose of being ""water ready"". For that I would probably be better off doing something inside the garage and then purchasing a rack for the SUV. Total cost

Marinas do charge a large fee because you're using their space.  ""Dry storage"" indoors or under cover would definitely be more expensive.

I keep my boat tied up to a floating dock in the water at a local marina year-round.  Makes for quick and easy access.

"I have always taken glass bottles. my cooler sits next to my chair. empties go straight back into the cooler. the one I am drinking just sits in the cut holder of my chair. I have done this for over 10 years with many, many beach trips. I have never once even had someone say anything to me about it. though I will say this was probably 80% private beaches at various hotels. and probably about 20% public beaches. but even with those 20% public beach trips. I have never had an issue. I would imagine having all the empties out of sight and in a hard cooler helps. if someone bothers to notice my drink at all. seeing 1 in a cup holder probably raises less alarm then seeing a bunch of empties in a plastic bag or something. I also make a point to not be very obnoxious or disruptive. I keep my music turned very low. sometimes no music at all if I cant find a beach or a spot that's not super crowded (I tend to avoid over crowded areas and such anyway). don't draw attention and don't be obnoxious and the odds of someone being a Karen are pretty low. I also often have a canopy if its a public beach so that helps give me some separation from the crowds

">Welp, when he goes to jail for the remainder of his life, you'll know they were not.

Reeves very well may go to prison, I think there is actually a decent chance that he is convicted. That has nothing to do with his actions leading immediately up to the shooting, however, which I’m fairly certain you understand. 

Unless, of course, you are arguing that telling someone to turn off their phone and going to the manager is somehow illegal. 

>Unfortunately George Zimmerman got everything thinking they can shoot anyone they want and just claim ""oh em gee I was scared"".

Zimmerman was as clear cut a case of self defense as any that didn’t have actual video evidence like Rittenhouse. 

>Reeves started the harassment. Reeves continued the harassment. You request that the DEAD father and husband should have just taken it and ignored him- well, that's well and good, but I think we all have our limits and at some point, we break.

Nope. I’d request that someone not escalate a verbal argument to felony battery. That seems like a pretty reasonable thing, don’t you? 

>My understanding is the theatre did not permit gun carry. Florida law allows carry but private businesses can have their own rules. The Grove had a large clearly displayed ""No Weapons"" policy.

Theater policy is not law. Reeves could have been asked to leave and trespassed if he refused, but that is all. 

>Yes, he escalated the situation by bringing a gun. That's why a wife has no husband and a child doesn't know their father. A dickhead karen who was wrong in a theater.

">Here's an idea, don't be an asshole to someone texting their babysitter during movie previews. 

I agree, but while Reeves may have been acting like an asshole, his actions were legal and nothing more than words. Mr. Oulson committed battery on a senior citizen, which is a felony in the State of Florida. 

>Reality is, this guy had a gun in a movie theatre. NO REASON to have one there. 

That is your opinion. The fact of the matter is that Reeves was lawfully carrying his weapon. 

>Reeves 10000% escalated the situation, by bringing the gun. 

How do you figure that the gun is responsible for the escalation? Oulson didn’t know that Reeves had the gun until Reeves shot him with it.

Of course not, but that isn’t what is legally relevant.

"Here's an idea, don't be an asshole to someone texting their babysitter during movie previews. Yeah, if someone started on me like that, and then threatened prior to a movie starting to report me to management, I'd say 'go ahead Karen, idgaf'. Witnesses say Reeves was having a full on toddler tantrum, even kicking seats as he huffed off to report the guy. He came back and kept on going and the guy threw his popcorn back at him. That's not life-threatening. Maybe mind your own business? This guy wasn't even doing anything wrong to begin with, any person trying to enjoy a date night away from their toddler is going to be irritated af about this kind of harassment.

Reality is, this guy had a gun in a movie theatre. NO REASON to have one there. The deputy that testified witnessing the incident and what was said has no reason to lie, if anything, you'd expect he'd lie to protect an ex-cop. It's clear even the guy's wife, at the time, was horrified by his actions. This ""well I asked him nicely"" is just a lie.

Reeves 10000% escalated the situation, by bringing the gun. End of story. Popcorn isn't going to kill you. That murderer isn't a victim just because he's an old man.

&#x200B;

  
TAMPA, Florida -- Hearing-impaired people tuning in to a news conference about the arrest of a suspected serial killer got a message of gibberish from an American Sign Language interpreter.  
As Tampa police Chief Brian Dugan announced the arrest of Howell Donaldson Wednesday night, interpreter Derlyn Roberts was there beside him, making signs that made no sense.  
""She sat up there and waved her arms like she was singing Jingle Bells,"" Rachell Settambrino, who is deaf and teaches American Sign Language at the University of South Florida, told the Tampa Bay Times through an interpreter.  
Among the things Roberts signed, according to Settambrino, was the following: ""Fifty-one hours ago, zero 12 22 (indecipherable) murder three minutes in 14 weeks ago in old (indecipherable) murder four five 55,000 plea 10 arrest murder bush (indecipherable) three age 24.""  
In fact, the chief was providing a timeline of the four shootings, and describing how his agency had received some 5,000 tips before arresting the 24-year-old suspect.  
""I was disappointed, confused, upset and really want to know why the city of Tampa's chief of police, who is responsible for my safety ... did not check her out,"" Settambrino said.  
Tampa Police Department spokesman Steve Hegarty said Monday that Roberts just showed up and told him she was there to provide the sign language interpretation at the Nov. 28 news conference. He assumed that someone else at the department called the service it uses for interpreters.  
""I allowed her to do it. I didn't ask enough questions,"" Hegarty said. ""  
How she knew about the press conference and why she volunteered to do sign language interpretation is still a mystery Hegarty wants to solve.  
""I don't know what motivates her, but she hasn't returned my calls,"" he said. ""I would like to know both professionally, and also personally, how did it occur to you to come down to do that?""  
At the next day's follow-up news conference, a different interpreter, Ben Zapata, was beside the chief.  
Hegarty said she won't face any charges. A person matching Roberts' name and age has an extensive criminal record that includes convictions for fraud over $50,000 and fraudulent use of personal information, but Hegarty couldn't confirm they are the same person. A message left at a number listed for Roberts wasn't immediately returned.  
It is the most recent example of an apparently unqualified signer appearing at news conferences. In September, as Hurricane Irma approached Florida and officials announced a mandatory evacuation, an interpreter in nearby Manatee County began signing words like ""pizza,"" ''monster"" and ""bear,"" along with other gibberish.  
Manatee County officials later said they were in a pinch and called on a county employee who had an understanding of sign language because he communicates with his deaf brother. However, it quickly became apparent he was in over his head. The deaf community demanded an apology and the video of the news conference went viral.  
In 2013 in South Africa, a fake interpreter appeared beside former President Barack Obama and other world leaders during a memorial service for Nelson Mandela, apparently signing gibberish. He later said he is schizophrenic and had seen angels descending in the stadium where the event took place.  
Settambrino said Florida, unlike some other states, does not require ASL interpreters to be certified through the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, a national nonprofit that ""seeks to uphold standards, ethics, and professionalism"" for the field, according to its website.  
Florida says only that ASL interpreters have to be ""qualified,"" Settambrino said.

Well anytime you have a police force as large as Tampa bays you're going to create crime in order to justify the tax dollars being spent on such police force I lived in Tampa right off of Fowler and 22nd I am mixed ethnicity and I have never seen racial profiling to the extent that was done there never once did I see anybody that was not of a brown color being arrested or pulled over for anything I have mixed blood but I appear predominantly white I have predominantly European descent in my blood but I would not consider myself completely Caucasian at all and I was blown away by how just corrupt and just disgusting the city area was and I had to get out of there as after two and a half years I was done there is no reason that a area that small should have such a massive massive police force just disturbing and to see never one time in two and a half years living there not one white dude getting pulled over while continuously ethnicity people of color being harassed and pulled over I'm not trying to stir no pot but I can honestly say I lived it I seen it and I was supposedly in the worst part of the hood I loved everybody around me all my neighbors of all colors and it was just it was just heartbreaking to see such a waste of people's hard-earned money and their taxes going to a system that was treating them like dirt,t2_aq1ac,tronlab,0,1642814684.0,0,t1_htojvoy,htojvoy,False,jamesworley,t3_ri7cfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/ri7cfu/i_had_no_idea_tampa_bay_had_so_much_crime/,I had no idea Tampa Bay had so much crime !,/r/tampabay/comments/ri7cfu/i_had_no_idea_tampa_bay_had_so_much_crime/htojvoy/,1,r/tampabay,0,1

"Tampa Bay area has a really bad transportation problem. Traffic is bad all the time, and the suburbs are pretty crappy with not much fun to do. Honestly, if you're looking for a house I would look for something small and maybe outdated in a more exciting area like Tampa Heights or Seminole heights. If you have a tolerance for ghettoness and crime, the area north of ybor (ybor heights, vm ybor) seems like it's slowly turning around and you can find a house there for much cheaper.

"I have lived in both Tampa and St. Petersburg each for around a year and these are my opinions of the two. St. Petersburg was family oriented and relaxed, you could potentially live out the beach bum persona. The bars or more like local joints and there are a few outdoorsy places to go but the potential to meet a long term partner is limited unless you stay confined to downtown where it boast clubs and a hipster entertainment scene.
Tampa host a wide variety of spots that could satisfy your desires such as the rocky point area, Ben T Davis beach where you can obtain that tiki hut, beach fantasy and still be relatively close to hot spots of the city. Downtown tampa has some great spots and host museums, the riverwalk and other activities but I particularly enjoy the Hyde Park area and Armature works, the atmosphere in both areas is phenomenal and you have the potential to meet some great people  whether for business adventures or personal intimacy.

"I’ve been out of the scene for a long time I’d say both, but mostly Tampa has more fast moving professionals and SP is a bit more laid back hipster. Everything around Tampa downtown and South Tampa *screams* “I telecommute doing tech/professional consulting and have plenty of disposable income” so there are too many businesses to count to cater to that demographic. SP has some similar stuff but is an older demographic and the younger people there aren’t as affluent. The real money in SP is in rich retired people.

You’re not going to find any good diving in the oceans around here. There isn’t much to see and the water is too murky. You have to drive a few hours south for that. Sailing is great other than the random violent storms that pop up out of nowhere. 

So basically I’m thinking you’d be more of a Tampa fit, and remember the beaches are only about a 45 minute drive from here.

Unless he did and it wasn’t revealed. I’m just wondering how did Rodgers follow vaccinated protocols without being vaccinated. Did they just take his word? Did they receive a vaccine card? Did they accept essential oils as his immunization? There are so many questions I have. It’s just really odd that no one knew Rodgers wasn’t vaccinated and allowed him to not follow protocols. It’s more likely he supplied a fake vaccination card or someone somewhere lied that he supplied one.,t2_gjkes,Mighty_Platypus,0,1638731119.0,0,t1_hncv9oo,hncv9oo,False,Privacy_74,t3_r9ad52,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/r9ad52/so_nfl_suspended_antonio_brown_for/,So NFL Suspended Antonio Brown For Misrepresenting His Vaccine Status Bu...,/r/tampabay/comments/r9ad52/so_nfl_suspended_antonio_brown_for/hncv9oo/,2,r/tampabay,0,2

"So, here is my question in regards to that. If a vaccine card has to be presented (for one reason or another) that should mean the players vaccine status should be known by the team and the league. This means that the team/league should know who has to follow whichever protocols are required based on vaccine status. How was Rodgers able to not follow protocol for half the year? Did the league not “card” him? Was it known and ignored? 

Regardless of infraction severity, I am of the opinion that there’s something fishy going on with the Rodgers case. This does not mean I am not 100% in agreement that Brown should also receive his punishment.

"Back in 2000 it was pretty much anarchy and I would not recommend it to anyone who didn’t want to get into a fight or other crazy shit. Over time it became a lot more tame but sill kind of seedy. It’s people of all kinds who come out to hit the clubs, get shitfaced and act irresponsibly. It got more touristy during the day and it’s a pretty interesting place to visit with lots of interesting shops and distilleries etc. 

If you go clubbing or bar hopping out there and don’t want any trouble you better leave before 2:30am because the clubs empty to the streets and it gets weird. Stay on 7th and 8th or nearby and when you reach the parts that are poorly lit and not many people you probably want to turn back.

USF students mostly stick to SoHo and all the bars around there.

"I would consider renting in st Pete. Personally I’m not a big fan of Clearwater. There is a younger scene in st Pete.

Also, for surfing I recommend cocoa beach but do check the surf lines to check because it is 2 hours and a half of a drive. Also, not sure why people are telling you that you won’t find apartments for that budget. My friends pay around that price or less to live in st Pete.

"Make sure you look at the condos and apartment complexes around 116th and MLK in St Pete. Its cheaper than living downtown, and you are 2 minutes from a highway to take you wherever you need to go. There’s places to kayak/paddleboard right there on 4th, a skatepark on at fossil park a few minutes away, and a 15 minute uber downtown st pete where all the bars and events are.

"UPDATE 06/05/2021: Duke is safe with Touch of Grey Rescue (https://facebook.com/touchofgreyrescue/). Thank God! He will now have surgery for his broken leg! He will be placed with a foster and once he is healed, he will be up for adoption. Here is the link to their website (https://www.touchofgreyrescue.com ). Thank you so much!


UPDATE 06/04/201: Duke received a rescue hold from another rescue and he will leave the shelter soon!!! Thank you all for sharing and for offering to foster him! I will update when he leaves the shelter! Thank you!

🚨URGENT – Duke needs a foster in Tampa Bay by 06/05/2021 or he will be euthanized

He has a broken leg and needs treatment ASAP

 
FOSTER NEEDED IN THE TAMPA BAY AREA: There is a rescue interested in saving him, but they need a foster in the Tampa Bay area. If you can foster Duke, please contact Passion 4 Pits via Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Passion4PitsRescue) or via email (passion4pitsrescue@gmail.com). ALL EXPENSES PAID BY THE RESCUE (medical and supplies)!


The rescue and Vet Clinic are in the Tampa Bay Area and that’s why they need a foster in Tampa Bay. But the rescue will be responsible for picking up Duke in Orlando and bringing him to the foster in Tampa Bay.

 
Duke is at Orange County Animal Services in Orlando. He was found as a stray running in a cow field with a broken radius and ulna. This poor guy can’t put weight on his front left leg. Duke is on pain medication administered by the shelter but he needs a full service vet. His eyes are also a mess. Duke is only a year old!! He did not react to other dogs when walking past kennels. This sweet guy needs your help!!
 
Please share Duke for a foster.

Who responds to a crash depends on the [Mutual Aid Agreement](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2020/23.1225) between overlapping agencies.

"If you like Broadway at the Beach you'll like John's Pass. Its not nearly as big, but similar sort of shops and restaurants. They have dolphin watching and a pirate ship trip too. 

Gulfport is cute to walk through for little shops and restaurants. 

My nieces and nephews absolutely loved the splash pad and the park at the new St Pete Pier. There's a nice little conservation museum with interactive exhibits they loved and several spots for ice cream. 

Jersey shore boardwalk wise, if you mean like the wildwood boardwalk then you'd probably need to go the busch gardens route to have rides and that sort of thing.

Not dinner time, but a good evening walk/plan. 

The riverwalk is awesome and you can walk all the way to Channel Side, for good food/snacks and hanging out. Have a bowling alley there as well.

Another fun thing to do is to park in Ybor city...hang out there for a bit, then take the tram to Channel Side to continue the fun...and then walk the riverwalk.

"Hi, there! I live in West Tampa with my family. It’s still an “up and coming” community as a lot of redevelopment has been happening, but it’s very central to a lot of things. There really isn’t anything within walking distance here in terms of nightlife or even day to day entertainment. It is right next to the 275, 5 minutes from downtown, 5 minutes to Hyde Park, very close to Armature Works and 10 minutes from Ybor. Other communities that 20-somethings seem to be living in around here are Riverside Heights (just on the other side of the river from West Tampa) and even Seminole Heights. All of these places are going to feel a little less polished as they are going through a bit of a revival right now, but they are centrally located and it seems more of a younger community is forming there.

"I know you said you’re looking for a city vibe, but I’m gonna toss out Safety Harbor for a few reasons:

1. It’s got a similar vibe downtown to Dunedin but way closer to Oldsmar and the other areas you mentioned like St. Pete and South Tampa/Hyde Park. You can take back roads to Oldsmar from Safety Harbor if a main road gets congested. Dunedin, on the other hand, is 15-20min from Oldsmar on a GOOD day with no traffic. 

2. Safety Harbor is a quick commute to the things you said you enjoy: 35 min to Downtown St. Pete, 35 min to Downtown Tampa, 20 min to Clearwater Beach and Dunedin, 25 minutes to Tampa International airport, 15 minutes to Clearwater-St. Pete airport, all on main roads to get you there quick when it’s not rush hour.

3. Safety Harbor gets you the best of both suburban shopping an amenities and a more urban downtown that has tons of events going on. I think what I like best about the Pinellas side of the bridge is you have access to a bunch of small towns like Safety Harbor, Dunedin, Tarpon Springs, Gulfport, etc, as well as the bigger cities like Clearwater and St. Pete all with their own feel. On the Hillsborough side, it’s more like “Tampa and the suburbs” with little variation.",t2_5gqb1meo,powellmacaque,0,1614903883.0,0,t1_gppusep,gppusep,True,darthyeyo,t3_lxrhs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/lxrhs7/morning_commute/,Morning Commute,/r/tampabay/comments/lxrhs7/morning_commute/gppusep/,6,r/tampabay,0,6

Oh yeah no doubt. We are a couple that’s the same age as you and we think Dunedin would be a great place to be. It isn’t that far of a commute to the two bigger cities but still has a lot of things to do and festivals and such.

"Well hell, man. Oldsmar is in the backyard of Westchase. We live 10 minutes from the RE Olds park and frequently go to those parks near the waterfront too.

"Hi there, welcome to the area! I was going to suggest the same area as this poster - Dunedin is an awesome place to live and constantly has stuff going on. There is a lot of nightlife, the pinellas trail, close to the beaches, and great restaurants. If Dunedin is too small town feel for you though, you’re pretty much limited to Tampa or Saint Pete. My dad has done the drive from safety harbor to downtown St Pete for work for 30 years and it takes him 30-40 minutes. 2 hours a day would be on the extreme end, maybe once a month due to an accident or something. The coast north of Clearwater beach is pretty rough until you get to Dunedin. I’d steer clear of this area and just south of downtown Clearwater as well. My ranking would be Dunedin, safety harbor, st Pete. I personally would choose St Pete over Tampa (if you’re limiting yourself to those two) because I wouldn’t want to rely on taking the Courtney Campbell on a daily commute to north pinellas. St Pete is a better city IMO as well. If you’re dead set on living in a more city vibe I’d go for it - it really won’t be that bad.",t2_deujk,fsu_seminoles,0,1614893005.0,0,t1_gpp7z1e,gpp7z1e,False,darthyeyo,t3_lxrhs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampabay/comments/lxrhs7/morning_commute/,Morning Commute,/r/tampabay/comments/lxrhs7/morning_commute/gpp7z1e/,4,r/tampabay,0,4
"Thanks! Westchase does sound really nice. I am attracted by the amount of golf courses I see around there. It sounds like from what you are saying though is that the commute doesn't seem so bad when you love where you live. I'm starting to think that St. Pete would be a nightmare commute, but locations west of downtown Tampa won't be as bad.

"Depends on where you are in North Pinellas.  


I live in Westchase and love it. Been here since I was your age and owned a home here the last 8 years. It is a great location with nice restaurants, vibrant communities and \*relatively\* easy access to both Pinellas county and Hillsborough locales.

It is that bad. Commutes in Tampa are terrible and I would suggest living close to where you work. Hyde Park to N. Pinellas would be even worse. I don't know much about West Tampa. I would recommend looking at areas around Dunnedin or Tarpon Springs as there are some really neat little areas there with lots to do plus you're close to the beach then which is a pretty big draw.
