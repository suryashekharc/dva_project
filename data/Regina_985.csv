"You’ll make more if you can sell privately, but it’s a lot more of a headache and a process. One dealership we talked to said they expect a full lot for inventory in the spring. If there is truth to that for the automakers my guess is used market prices will start to go down due to less demand for used vehicles at their current inflated price point. 

I traded in about a week ago. Turned out to be 2500 above top estimated market value using Canadian Black Book (multiple dealerships estimated value with this tool). I decided the headache of a private sale wasn’t worth it with the deal I got on the table. Especially if  markets will rebound with inventory soon in which case the delay of a private sale may end up driving the value down.

"All else equal, EV’s are harder on the road.  Small and large cars are not comparable, regardless of power unit.  The jacked RAM driver is not considering a small car regardless, so this isn’t useful in considering relative impacts.  You have to consider the alternatives a given buyer might consider.

An F-150 is average 4500 lbs (+/- based on options), the lightning is 6500 lbs.

The Leaf is around 3700 lbs.  The Honda Civic which is approx 20cm longer, 30 wider and 200L more passenger volume weighs about 3000 lbs.

Batteries are heavy.  Roll a couple AA’s in your hand and consider size/weight ratio there.  Now imagine 25,000 of them together standing on end.  This is basically what an EV ‘skateboard’ platform is (that’s the lowest performance Tesla, higher ones are upwards of 35,000). Heavier cars do more damage to the road.

"Two points:

1 - How is it my fault that companies are fucking ridiculous with packaging? The city gave me a bin that fits maybe 3 garbage bags, for a family of 6 and then they want to pick it up only bi-weekly (and even then, there's a 50/50 garbage truck just doesn't pick it up for whatever reason they feel like giving that day). Of course I'm gonna complain about bi-weekly pickup.  I would be more willing to use my blue cart for what it's supposed to be used for if I didn't have to survive for a month on 3 garbage bags for a family of 6 or have to drive my garbage to the dump and pay for it myself, even though I'm paying the exact same amount for garbage pickup as my neighbours with a bin 3x the size of mine. 

2- This isn't so much about being a responsible citizen. When do we expect companies to be responsible? Are we just going to forever offload the responsibility of corporations onto the consumer? Sure it's a lot easier, but it's a waste of time and effort because it's not going to change anything. You know what is more effective than trying to get 7.8billion people on board with an idea? Getting a couple hundred companies on board.

"I think you need to set it to 14 Grains of hardness, which is the hardness of water coming in. Most systems will soften to dead soft or zero gpg hardness at the output. Only really expensive bypass systems ever soften to a set ouput hardness so I doubt you have that. They are very rare.

To verify your softener is working properly you need to test its output water. Test it a couple times through a cycle and catch it right before it regenerates if you can. If the water out is always 0 to 1 gpg (dead soft), it's still working. If it jumps up to say 3 or more before next regen the settings are off. It may be difficult to determine the next regen,,, check display or mechanical control info,, or just test it every few days. Mine (Flex5600) regens at a certain gallons of water through it, or if it hits its 16 day max cycle setting, whichever comes first. PS  best to always run a bit of water out of faucet before collecting a sample too.

"Regina has water quality reports that show this Grains Per Gallon hardness. I think it was around 11 at the plant, but by the time it arrives to a typical home it adds a bit from pipes. I would expect or plan for about 14 GPG. Hard, but nowhere near as hard a well water. Ie daughter in Fort Qu'Appelle is at 35 gpg, but she does well with one of those units that Costco sells or used to.  I have a dropper test kit, 5-B that I used to test with, but have not done one recently. Many Regina water places will, or would, test a sample if you brought it in for free. Bought a 32,000 (1cu-ft) grain softener online and it only uses about 4 bags a year for a family of two. All water is softened except outside and toilet water. Used to have an old softener that used way too much salt. A 40,000 (ish) grain one should be good for a Regina family of 2 to 4 people. Lot to consider in salt per regen, and days, and gallons used in order to get max salt and water efficiency without hardness breaking through, but I run about 16 day (max) cycle and always have dead soft water. I can't remember the salt pounds per regen. Been too long... but you want a bit bigger softener and hit it with less salt if I remember right for best efficiency. Again 40K is likely close for Regina, and 14gpg.

"Washington Park has always been the ‘official’ name in city documents and maps but never used in current practice. Colloquially, it’s North Central. 

From the 1910s until the 1950s, the neighbourhood was known as Washington Park. 3rd avenue was Washington Avenue, 2nd Avenue was Chicago Avenue, and 1st was Garfield Avenue (named after American presidents and the city of Chicago, presumably to attract American property speculators in the early boom of the city). In the 1950s, the streets were renamed to the numbered street names, except for McKinley Avenue, which lives on at the northern tip of North Central just below Regent Park. No idea why the names were changed.

Our attached garage was sinking on the wall furthest from the attachment to the house. We dug a channel along the one side and saw that the garage had fallen off of the piles so we drilled new piles on an angle beneath the wall. Used bottle Jack's on the old piles and new piles to push the wall up level then cemented them in place with plywood forms. After cleaning up we filled in the part we dug out with mud jacking slurry as it settles quickly and we could pave over it within the week. All told it was a few thousand dollars to get done but it was a lot of back breaking labor. And my brother owns a trenching company so digging out the trench and drilling the piles was minimal cost.

"Ok, firstly, 100% you shouldn't have to do this and it's unfair, but...I just bought my own. Improved my mental health exponentially and got me out of having to deal with the landlord anymore.

Also, keep *every* communication you ever have with your landlord about the defective one, and the receipt for one you buy (if you do). When you move out, should he be the type of landlord that looks for excuses to ding you on your damage deposit, you can show him both and comment about how you'd welcome an opportunity to discuss costs at a tribunal with the Rentalsman.

Now I'm living in a place where I can't grow and ive switched to The Joint/Canna Cabana for most of my stuff. Hard to beat their prices on a lot of things it seems.

"The diagrams make no sense. It's a regular Tim's with a roof that is painted green. No green roof anywhere looks like a golf course.

Things that can handle the droughts and heavy rainfall and cold winters. It does need annual maintenance. 

Supposedly this building is going to have a grey water collection system for the landscaping. I'd guess the owner hasn't fully priced out how much that system installation, operation and maintenance, plus the cost of the green roof are going to add to the build price from what has been presented.

"How about this... it's easy to get homeless real fast if you have, ie. a mental health issue - our system is a disaster, anyone in healthcare will tell you that, and you lose your job, because our system for catching people who slip through ther cracks is shit. Or, if you can't find a job. Good luck! We have the lowest or second lowest minimum wage in the country. Even if you find a job, it will pay far less. So yeah, the grass isn't always fucking greener!

What I would like is proper healthcare and social programs, instead of the corrupt provincial gov just selling off things like our provincial bus transit system because they've ran out of change. Im also tired of living with so many right wing, racist hillbillies who have no intent to change or educate themselves. 

Saskatchewan these days is not a pleasant place, and Regina's not that awesome.. to put it mildly. I miss what my province used to be before people started to lose their minds - some of my own family included, another impact of COVID on our already struggling system. They are having trouble seeing their small town GP, which has never been a problem before. So it's not just my health, but my parents', my partner's, etc. 

I'd rather be house poor, and happy and healthy, than letting money pile up in my account because i'm frankly too depressed or anxious to even go out and spend it. Poor sucks.

"Pricing is insane. I laugh at people comparing the cost of taking a family of 4 bowling or to the movies and saying it is cheaper to go here. Looking strictly at admission prices, the cost for both bowling and movies for a family (and a couple for that matter) is cheaper than this place.  


As for blaming their overhead, it is no different than any other entertainment venue, and is even less than many. Any idea how much it would have cost Landmark and Galaxy to build those buildings from the ground up, including all of the recliners, projection equipment, sound systems and everything else?? And once open, they have land taxes and other maintenance costs that would exceed this place's rent. Not even close in comparison. Bowling usually only takes about an an hour too, but a movie you get almost twice the length of entertainment for less money. This place is just gouging and taking advantage of people who are desperate for something to do in this city. And before you jump at me saying I don't know what I am talking about, I ran both a movie theatre and a mini golf course in Alberta years ago and there is no comparison between the operating costs involved. Movie theatres also have to give upwards of half their admission prices to the movie distributors, whereas mini-golf keeps the full admission price.  


If you think $18 is a good value (or even the $16 they have since dropped to) and have no problem paying that price, fine, but don't try to compare it to other forms of entertainment and say it is a great deal in comparison. Guessing those comments are by the owners, staff, and friends/family.

"I have to admit, your messages are a bit vague sometimes, but I will try to respond in the best way I can.  


I will have to state, I came from the states, I'd mentioned it in a few other posts, so I unfortunately am not too aware of the ins and outs of Canadian politics (though to be fair I don't know a lot about American politics either).  


I want to ask, regarding the national emergency, are you talking about the pandemic, the convoy, both?  


If it's regarding the pandemic, I don't think we're in the clear. But, whether or not restrictions should be put on is beyond me, I wear my mask, I stay inside (mostly because I'm not very social and I don't have a job), I do what I can. I prefer the vaccine requirements for some things, but I like the idea of ""Smoker rooms"" now being vax rooms in restaurants, and think it's an okay enough trade off.  


Sorry I got side-tracked, needless to say, obviously I'm not a gov't official, I don't know what the department of security, or whatever Canadians call their equivalent, is up to.   


But I want you to think about this in terms of numbers for a moment,   


Let's say, Canada has 50 Million people in total, for the sake of this thought.  


Out of the 50 Million Citizens, 4% in this scenario are Extremists, 2 Million total. Another 37% are General Assholes (or, right wing lads in this case), that's another 18.5 MILLION, people.  


In this fantasy Canada, where only 50 Mil residents are present, do you honestly think that the government will spend resources on Servers to hold information on the 20.5 Mil residents, will save all their selfies and track their conversations (excluding encrypted services like Discord or Telegram).  


Now for a little more math, each one of these 20.5 million people posts 20 photos in 6 months, sends 2,000 messages, and saves 4 songs.  


A single text message over SMS is .0001335 MB in this scenario, 2,000 of those makes for .267 MB, 20.5 million times this is 5.47 Million MB or, 5.47 Terabytes.  


A single photo from an iPhone is generally about 3MB, 20 is 60MB, 20 x 20.5 is 410 Million photos, or, 24 Billion and 600 Million MB, or, 24.6 Petabytes (one Petabyte is 1000 Terabytes).  


One song is about 2MB per minute, assuming each of these 4 songs saved is 3 minutes, that's 6MB, then times 20.5 mil to get 123Million MB, or 123 Terabytes.  


Every single year, the government would need to store 49 Petabytes and 456.94 Terabytes of information, somewhere, in the hopes that something MIGHT happen.  


And keep in mind, they HAVE to keep it all, so that if they pursue someone in court, they can pull up YEARS of conversation and such to prove this person so thoroughly wrong. And that's JUST 42% of the population, assuming every single person sends the same amount of texts, and no emails, no youtube videos watched or anything.   


This, along with how governments fail time and time again to prevent people from harming themselves or others , first person who comes to mind is the famous case about Alek Minassian, who's internet post history was blatantly obvious that he was going to harm others, there's no way the government is tracking people the way you think they are.   


They're busy tracking the 77 listed groups who threaten democracy according to my single google search about how many terrorist groups are known in Canada, which is a lot already.  


According to very brief searches online, Police solve about 50% of every murder case, other places claim they solve about 2-4% of their total case-loads but I haven't looked deeply into that.  


They'd want to make sure the Police could solve, I dunno, at least 40% of their total case-loads before they decide to allocate resources to counting how many times Mary visits grandad at the farm.  


Also, as a side note, us arguing is what they want. The more the working class argues about left and right, blue vs red, the less we realize that the wealthy class is screwing us over, and that capitalism is killing us all.

"That's a decent amount of courses, you'll want to get comfortable! I'll give you my recommendations :). 

1. Definitely recommend joining a federated college, either Campion or Luther (You'll still be in UofR). I'm not religious (they allow agnostics and atheists), but being part of a smaller community on campus helps with benefits and supports. And also free food :D! They do a lot of events where I have met the majority of my friends. Did I mention free food?
2. I would recommend joining one of the societies. Since you're going into engineering, I'd suggest taking a look at the engineering students society, I got some friends in there. If you like gaming, I have a few friends in the Smash Club and they actually compete at tournaments. Unfortunately, the clubs I am in or started have been deactivated or will be as we're all graduating and covid has made it hard to get new members, but feel free to browse the associations [here](https://www.ursu.ca/clubs-and-societies/). 
3. There are some programs you could join like UR Guarantee and the Ambassadors, they do a lot of events for their own members. I've made some friends from there, but more so gotten free meals xD.   
4. Restaurants: Best for breakfast - [Perkins](https://www.perkinsrestaurants.com/locations/ca/sk/regina/1800-prince-of-wales-dr/), Best for lunch - [Uncle Sunny](https://unclesunny.ca/), Best for dinner - [Classic Buffet](https://www.classicbuffetcompany.ca/services-banquets-buffet-sk.php), Best calories for dollar - [Kung Pao](https://www.facebook.com/kungpaowokregina/).

"I agree with this. People today believe that no one should feel any discomfort in their lives. Got a sore shoulder? Get a prescription. Feeling sad? Get a prescription. It’s much easier to pop a pill than deal with the cause of discomfort. And we know many people’s addictions start with drugs prescribed to them.

But I don’t know how we shift our culture away from this mindset.

I also feel this is separate from those who have experienced severe trauma throughout their lives - abuse, poverty, etc. - who have never been provided tools to cope and seek a means of escape as an alternative to suicide.
