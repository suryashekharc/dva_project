"On personal experience I do not trust UVa northridge. I went back to my doctor in dc to manage my medication because the first thing Anita Clayton had her resident do was take me off Prozac and go on Wellbutrin.  This put me in a rapid cycle state and made me very irritable, almost complete rage. So the next resident under her direction increased the Wellbutrin.  This made the depression and irritation even worse. So they added another medication of the same type and that drove me into a deeper depression. While in this state they just asked how my dating life was going. I had lost my job, had huge fall out with my family and could barely function.  I had to go back to annual appointments and monthly phone calls with the doctor I saw before leaving for he dc area. He was shocked what had happened.  I later found out from dr. Shemo that he used to run that clinic and trained Anita Clayton. All she does is run paid “studies” by the pharmaceutical companies and writes books on antidepressants and sexual health.

"So, 5 East has it's good and bad points. You will be safe. There are some nurses that are deeply caring, and some that are burnt out. They can provide you with good resources, but it's boring as hell. There isn't much in the way of talk therapy, but the nurses are great listeners and will speak with you in private. 

I have been there a few times and the last time I went directly from 5 East to Region Ten and that was the perfect solution. 5 East will make sure you are safe and handle the immediate crisis, and Region Ten will help get you set up for the future. I will say that 5 East is very much what you make of it. If you go there not ready to get help, it'll be miserable, lame, and useless. Everything will seem stupid. If you really want to get better you'll have to do some of the silly activities in the art room and such, but you will get some good out of those activities. 

Basically, whether a person is ready to get better or not, 5 East will keep them safe and try to stabilize there; whereas, if a person is ready to get better and start putting forth their own effort it can be incredibly helpful! 

Going from 5 East to Region 10 worked so well for me because I could crash and slowly rebuild. I spent the first couple days at 5 East completely quiet and processing; the next few talking to nurses, doing the activities, planning, and processing. After that I went to Region 10 where there is freedom to cook and it's a more open area. Once I was there, the crisis had passed enough that I could deeply take advantage of their great resources and build myself up to a state that I was ready to leave. 

The two are very different. If you're in crisis, go to Region 10. If you need intense support, go to Region 10. If it's both, go to 5 East and then Region 10.",t2_g88cf,adorkablepenguin,0,1648256745.0,0,t1_i2518km,i2518km,False,Arch_moraluniverse,t3_tny627,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tny627/best_local_for_hospital_mental_health_crisis/,Best local for hospital mental health crisis?,/r/Charlottesville/comments/tny627/best_local_for_hospital_mental_health_crisis/i2518km/,9,r/Charlottesville,0,9

"Although it wasn't an emergency or admittance situation, I've had positive experiences with the staff at UVA's Northridge facility. A friend had good things to say about her emergency stay with Region Ten.   


I think everyone who even considers going in for help, is probably scared and anxious. It's not something we talk about generally, so it remains mysterious. I'm sure word would get around, though, if a particular facility had a lot of horror stories. I'm sure your doctor or therapist would tell you if they had bad feelings about one. If you have family or friends that might visit, I would choose the one closest to them, just to encourage more visits.

"I grew up in Alexandria and have lived in Cville for the past 4 years. Based on what you're looking for, you want Alexandria. Cville is a great place and I really enjoy it, but it can't compete with Alexandria in terms of job prospects/schools in all honesty. If you want ""trendy"" downtown, Alexandria has Old Town and you're really not far from DC. The GW Parkway stretches from Mt. Vernon nearly up to McLean, and it has a great walking/running/cycling path that runs basically parallel to it along the Potomac. Traffic sucks, but that's a given in NOVA.

Again, I really like living in Cville, and I think it's a great place. But it's much smaller and quieter than Alexandria, and there's really not as much to do, comparatively.

"I am from the northeast and recently made a move to Charlottesville. It is definitely NOT ""trendy"" as what we think of in the northeast. The downtown, while very neat, safe (by my standards) and clean, looks more like a fancy shopping mall than anything ""quaint"" except for the nice bookstores. 

I made the move because I no longer need the vibe of having everything open almost 24 hours in NYC, and crowds make me tired now, as well as just having too many people around me in general at all times. So, if you are looking for quiet, NOT having a lot of options in the way of entertainment....then I'd say Charlottesville makes sense. It definitely does for me, and I like exactly what I saw with some quirks here and there. 

Housing is notoriously expensive in Charlottesville, and extremely hard to find. It is not an affordable town by any means, but given the salary you post, you'll be fine. I say this because a lot of people expect it, due to its location, to be cheaper than say, NYC, and while it is ""cheaper"" than NYC in a few areas, not by much. 

Slower? Yup, it is definitely slower...but if you are used to having a ""yes or no"" immediately, you might be disappointed in Charlottesville. People just take their time down there a lot more, and are way more laid back (but to me, that's a positive) about things. You will not find the hustle and bustle of NYC areas, or the sense of ""urgency"" to get something done. At least, that's been my experience. 

For me, what I have really liked about Charlottesville are the people I've met (fantastic!), the scenery, and calmer vibe. Just, don't expect anything like what I gather you want. I think NOVA is a better fit for you.

"I wouldn't describe Charlottesville as truly ""quirky"" but it does have a lot of different facets of culture to offer its residents. The music and arts scene are relatively robust for a small town, including local symphonies, McGuffey art center, some of the best high school music and theater around (AHS and CHS), local bands, and more (Dave Matthews is from Cville and has had a lasting impact on the area through spots like the Music Resource Center).

The restaurant scene is excellent! As are the farmer's markets. So many ways to support small local businesses. I would say one of Cville's best attributes is the dearth of chain restaurants. You almost never need to go to a chain - and would likely be judged for choosing one - because there are soooooo many amazing local restaurants.

While the Downtown Mall has lost a lot of its quirk since the 90s, you can always find local buskers (including my sister on violin), local artists, and various events during the warmer months.

"It's pretty expensive and there's not that much to do if you're not ""outdoorsy.""

I've not been there extensively but some of my friends have, and they've told me it's small, quaint, weird roads and driving habits (to which I can attest personally).

Based on your income, I'd imagine you'd be fine financially (my friends and myself are, well, nowhere close to that tax bracket, shall we say), but if you're coming from a big city with a thriving city life and/or downtown, C-Ville ain't that. Sure, some decent food for sure, but a ""big city"" it ain't. The people I know who have lived there were bored to tears (again, they didn't have money to throw around).

Another thing that I wouldn't even think about that was brought to my attention when a friend moved there, is that it's difficult to access public services, like doctors and lawyers. You'd think being home of UVA would make it a hub for things like that, but I guess they all go to Richmond. It has been annoyingly difficult for my friends to access public services like that because it's just so small. Want a doctor's appointment in a big city? No problem. There are dozens to pick from and appointments galore. In Charlottesville, it's slim pickings and be ready to wait a month before you can do anything. Money also might be a factor here.

That being said, I also know a guy who *isn't* cash strapped who has been there for years and found it hard to connect with people, and is basically gonna bail as soon as he retires. This anecdote strikes true from what I've heard from others. It's small, but lacks the small town feel where everyone knows everyone.

Basically my impression is that it's got all the cons of a big city (crap driving, expensive), and all the cons of a small town (nothing to do).

It's pretty though.",t2_bz1xm,Raymanuel,1,1648192191.0,0,t1_i21csss,i21csss,True,[deleted],t3_tndfxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tndfxv/is_cville_for_me/,Is Cville for me?,/r/Charlottesville/comments/tndfxv/is_cville_for_me/i21csss/,-2,r/Charlottesville,0,-2

There is a thing here called Friday's After Five where a weekly mini festival happens downtown in the summer, as well as the Sunset Series on Carter Mountain. There's live music at the Jefferson, the Southern, and various bars, pubs or on the street downtown. The city has art all over, from the walls and fences on Avon to the Corner to the outer city limits. 

Charlottesville is home to a truly staggering amount of restaurants, I do not believe there is a person alive who has been to them all. And of course we have our famous Chicken Strip, a fried chicken chain restaurant car conga line which the locals rave about! We got the local myth ""The Farty Car"" which tells a story of a car ripping ass all up and down C'ville, Clapping Man who legend says still can be heard inside the cavernous interior of the gift-wrapped husk of the Landmark Hotel, and a lone conservative dyslexic grandpa who seems to have been left behind in this town by his disowned liberal kids on their way back to BF Texas. 

Love students? We got em! Hate students? You'll fit right in too! For every jar is a lid, and we got so many jars you might wonder where the lids are coming from.

This Friday, GRAMMY-nominated musician Joe Troop (Che Apalache) brings his Latingrass ensemble to The Front Porch. It'll be a perfect night to enjoy LIVE music - especially this sweet marriage of Latin + bluegrass sounds.  


Fri March 25th  
8pm // $20

Here's the event text from the venue's website:  


The Front Porch is proud to cohost this concert with The Virginia Folklife Program.  
Joe Troop is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter hailing originally from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The founder of GRAMMY-nominated stringband Che Apalache, Troop’s music is deeply embedded with and inspired by his activism. After spending the last year learning direct action from stalwart progressive organizers, the radical folk singer is now channeling that energy into his first proper solo album Borrowed Time. The record was co-produced with Jason Richmond (The Avett Brothers, Branford Marsalis) and features music luminaries like Béla Fleck (who produced Che Apalache’s GRAMMY-nominated album), Abigail Washburn, Tim O’Brien, and Charlie Hunter, but the visceral songwriting speaks for itself. The worldly songs and instrumentals are influenced both by Troop’s time spent living abroad as well as his upbringing as an openly gay bluegrass musician in rural North Carolina.Joe will be joined by Omar Ruz-Lopez (Violet Bell) on fiddle, Ramon Garcia on Upright Bass, and Brevan Hampden on Percussion.",t2_7c8wjf7r,kingofwinecups,0,1648174491.0,0,t1_i20j7vo,i20j7vo,True,AutoModerator,t3_tj7e49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tj7e49/weekly_events_thread_for_the_week_of_march_21_2022/,"Weekly Events Thread for the Week of March 21, 2022",/r/Charlottesville/comments/tj7e49/weekly_events_thread_for_the_week_of_march_21_2022/i20j7vo/,1,r/Charlottesville,0,1

They also don’t sit there and count if you’re within reason.  Mobile devices you can get paid to recycle soooo not sure what you’re complaining about there.

"That's what I want to know. Not too familiar with Cav A. I thought with Cav Aquatics there was a year-round option for those older and more competitive swimmers as well as as Summer Team option for those not wanting to ready to dive in head first. Though from the website it does appear that Cav A is much more on the serious and competitive team side (like a travel baseball / basketball travel team)

I guess I should have been a little more clear on background. My kids have been doing JSL  through ACAC the past 3-4 years. After last summer the ACAC program ceased as I understand there were differences of opinion on the direction of the swim program between the coaches and ACAC brass. In addition to JSL, ACAC also had a USA Swim Team which was for those wanting the more competitive / year-round swimming. They would practice during the school year and take part in USA Swimming meets. That would end in April/May and those participating transitioned into JSL Summer Swim Team which then recycled back to their USA Swim program in the fall.

My kids are a little younger (<10) still trying to figure out what sports they want to do more seriously but they have really enjoyed swim team through ACAC/JSL the past several years.

That proposal is then reviewed by the donor and usually (especially if the ground work for the relationship is already established) more or less accepted as is.

"I have directed traffic occasionally and I have also been on the receiving end of some very bad direction.  Signals should be unambiguous, as seen by the motorist, and from a very limited vocabulary of signals to avoid confusion.   They also should not be easily confused with other signals in the absence of good depth perception (which in some lighting, weather conditions, and distances, isn't very good over the distance you are moving your arms); waving hands back and forth at certain angles, for example, can look an awful lot like the motion to come on, keep it moving (just ask the cop who almost walked into the path of my car after giving improper signals).   Signals may be somewhat different on the highway, in a work zone (where one hand is on a sign), crossing guard with sign vs without, in a parking lot (slower, closer, and less training), or backing up a vehicle, though.  There also seems to be some variation between states and countries.  Also, arms get tired and people get sloppy.

Based entirely on your description, which may not be accurate:

>They then pointed at my car (lead in a line of 5) and waved his arms   
past his body
Pointing extended hand directly at a motorist, then moving in some direction:  Go in the direction I pointed, not necessarily the one you were signalling for, and in this case it would appear the direction would be straight.

>bent over, tapped the crosswalk, 

Palms facing down and moving towards the ground: slow down!

>and raised his hands to   
the heavens while facing away from us.

Somebody should  probably stop.  Specifically, the directions his palms were facing which should also be the direction his arms raised at 45 degrees above horizon should be facing.   Which was probably the direction on the side streets.  More or less the same meaning as outstretched horizontal arm with palm facing you (talk to the hand) but visible from further away.   Also arms crossed in front of face also means stop but this would typically be used when directing an emergency vehicle backing up into a bay or at an accident scene, not directing the general flow of traffic.  In some areas, officer facing you with palm towards you while the other arm is out to the side is stopping both you and oncoming traffic - so if his back is to you and his arm is out roughly horizontal perpendicular to your line of travel that means stop even though his palm probably isn't facing you unless his palm is raised towards cross traffic.  If he turns, while the arms raised 45 degrees above horizontal, palms facing outward, he is probably stopping traffic in all directions.  If he has his hands up waving side to side while facing you, that is probably some sort of emergency stop/flag down.  If his arms were straight up I wouldn't consider that a proper signal but, I would probably interpret that as stopping whoever he, and his palms, were facing.  None of that seems to be an indication you were to stop.

Since divorcing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, MacKenzie Scott has been giving away her fortune faster than any billionaire ever. So much so, the 51-year-old novelist has donated considerably more in the past two years than her ex-husband has in his entire lifetime. According to Forbes, Scott has distributed at least $8.6 billion in less than two years to about 780 charitable groups focused on gender equality, racial justice, public health and more. This amounts to more than 14% of her current net worth—which stands at $53.5 billion as of January 19, 2022—including 10% in a single year. Bezos, on the other hand, has given away roughly $2.1 billion in his entire lifetime; a little over 1% of his $184.8 billion net worth.

"Correct. The main post deals with Scott's donation to HFH International, but let's look into your claim a little further. 

In July 2020, Scott was ranked the 22nd-richest person in the world by Forbes after her divorce settlement. At that time, her net worth was $36 billion. 

Within a mere six months, Scott was the world's richest woman and one of the wealthiest humans in the history of the world with a net worth of $62 billion. 

**Scott increased her wealth by $26 billion during the first year of COVID-19.** 

In the year Scott added $26 billion to her wealth, she had $5.8 billion in charitable gifts. 

In 2021, she had $2.7 billion.

The tax rate for those who annually make $523,601 or more is 37%. Her publicized generosity acts as a way to reduce federal income tax through the charitable tax deduction while drawing attention away from the obscene profits made during a pandemic.

"I provided context to your fawning over a billionaire (a level of wealth you admittedly deem undeserved in the face of current ""abundant extreme poverty"") who donated around a half a percent of her net worth while being among the wealthiest individuals in all of human history and currently the wealthiest woman in the world.

Mostly I took issue with your directing people to public relations campaigns paid for by the billionaire as evidence of said billionaire's generosity while acting as a way to reduce federal income tax through the charitable tax deduction.

Scott is worth $62 billion, an amount which has nearly doubled since the outset of COVID-19. 

In the past, Scott worked for hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co. who specialized in exploiting loop holes in financial markets to make the vastly wealthy even more wealthy at the expense of others. Her father, Jason Baker Tuttle, was an investment banker barred by the SEC for ""squandering his clients' money with his lavish spending."" 

That sure sounds like she was raised with a silver spoon by an underserving thug and then went to work for a soulless hedge fund. Did the Scott PR puff pieces not inform you of that?

To answer your questions in order:

1. Publicizing the source of the individual donations serves one purpose: improving public relations of the donor. This is a successful practice, as evinced by your adoration, that shifts the focuses of public opinion to the fractions of wealth donated rather than the massive amounts hoarded. If done anonymously, the non-profits would see no difference in how the money is used. I think you almost grasp this point as you defended Scott's publicity by comparing her to ""People \[who\] say and do the dumbest shit on social media for 'likes'"".
2. There is no higher standard for Scott compared to other billionaires.

"It sounds like you're upset that 1. a wealthy woman is publicizing her donations, 2. she isn't donating enough, and 3. she obtained her wealth through marriage laws.    


Regarding 1.-- Why not publicize donations? It encourages other billionaires to do the same thing. People say and do the dumbest shit on social media for ""likes"", I take no issue with a wealthy person earning good publicity from giving away her money to Planned Parenthood, Habitat, HBCUs, and countless tiny nonprofits.Also, one of her foundation's goals is to ""[trust non-profits to decide when and how to share information about their gifts](https://mackenzie-scott.medium.com/no-poetry-this-time-c991fdb836c4)""

Why the high standard for her when so many other billionaires sit on their fortunes?

Context matters. The Oxford dictionary is intended to be layman’s terms. The layman needs to know if they get a vaccine they’ll have some sort of immunity for what that vaccine is designed for. For a long time people didn’t know or care about their healthcare, they would just go to the doctor and say fix me up. People weren’t skeptical, they trusted what they were told because they had an inherent trust. That trust has disappeared over time as people have become more skeptical and inquisitive. Skeptisism plays a huge role like never before in what information we accept ranging from religious beliefs to what news we accept. So I can see why layman’s terms don’t work anymore. 

However, you may be onto something. Society has gotten smarter, more skeptical, and has access to better information now, so maybe we need to not tailor things to the layman as much. 

>	Just admit it doesn’t work like originally intended. Why do you have such a hard time doing that? It’s been effective and it’s been ineffective enough 

The vaccine has worked as intended. The intention of a vaccine is always to reduce death rates, reduce hospitalizations, and reduce and eliminate the impact of whatever the vaccine is meant to help protect against. Nobody ever promised that the vaccine would make COVID-19 go away (except for the Orange moron who said it would go away “like a miracle”). Every medicine created ALWAYS has edge cases that are statistically insignificant. The COVID-19 vaccine is one of the safest vaccines ever created. Modern medicinal science has allowed us to rapidly respond to the spread of a virus like never before. It’s a feat of modern medical science and proves that we’re making positive advancements. 

A huge risk from a rapidly spreading virus is the availability of medical treatment. If enough of the population gets sick at once, the medical system cannot treat them all, and those who go untreated could die. We’ve seen this happen in real-time during this pandemic. So again, there’s no refuting this claim. Vaccines help alleviate this problem by reducing hospitalization rates. 

>	the common follow-up question after someone says they’ve had Covid, is, “Did you get vaccinated?”

The reason that follow up question is asked is if someone isn’t vaccinated they have a higher chance of long-term effects of COVID. It’s also a social cue. While it’s one’s personal choice to get vaccinated, there are societal consequences for the individual as well as society for that personal choice. A large part of society has decided that they do not want to associate with unvaccinated individuals to lower their risk of exposure. It’s no different than society not wanting to associate with violent criminals (see: prisons), pedophiles (see: prisons), or otherwise. While that’s a more extreme example, the consequences match the choice. With being anti-vaccination the consequence is loss of income and loss of social standing. It’s about assessing risk to oneself and those one interacts with. 

From a medial standpoint it’s a cue for possible testing being needed in the future.

The benefits of the large donations is that it allows the experts in the field (ie Habitat for Humanity Int'l) to help coordinate where the money is going, work on economies of scale to get better value for money, as well as to strategize with a view of the bigger picture (both in terms of geography and long term need) for the large sum. The fact that the donation was made as an unrestricted one (who knows what the exact terms are, though) also shows that Ms Scott is putting a lot of faith in Habitat to implement their mission. All of those things are difficult for smaller, community based organizations that aren't positioned to spend big chunks of change like this. Not saying those smaller orgs are any less valuable, capable in their sphere, or needed, just that there is value in ""bulk"" donations. In addition, as far as your suggestions, PACEM does have religious affiliation, which may have also been seen as a potential negative when other organizations are serving the same/similar space

That being said, on the other side of the spectrum, it is also not uncommon for philanthropists like this to have smaller community based grants that might be targeted. They're generally either less ""strategic"" in nature - ie helping support specific projects - or they are more niche/pet organizations that the donor has close personal connections to. Sometimes there is even a separate foundation for these types of awards where they are less visible and awards don't come with as much fanfare as a half billion dollar grant would get.

> I just also wonder what, say, PACEM or TJACH could do with a cool 5 mil.

Again, I don't want to denigrate the work that they are doing, which I am sure is great, but the fact that they had FY2020 budgets of $320k and $1.4mil respectively, I don't think they would be in a position to scale up and deliver in a timely and efficient fashion to a sudden (and potentially one time) influx of $5million",t2_xjdhauk,BasicBrewing,0,1648044203.0,0,t1_i1snw54,i1snw54,False,cvillecville,t3_tkttxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tkttxs/greater_charlottesville_habitat_receives_575/,Greater Charlottesville Habitat receives $5.75 million from Mackenzie Scott,/r/Charlottesville/comments/tkttxs/greater_charlottesville_habitat_receives_575/i1snw54/,12,r/Charlottesville,0,12

"I lived at Lakeside for several years a little over 10 years ago and loved it. At the time the inside of the apartment was a little dated but I would assume they have updated them in the past 10 years since I was there. I had a 2BR on the ground floor which faced Carter Mountain so it was a nice view for sure. I thought it was very quiet and never heard our neighbors above or next to my apartment. Only a couple miles from downtown. A lot of great amenities including sand volleyball court, tennis court, good pool, small dog park, small beach area at the lake, suitable gym. You can walk around the lake and it's right next to one of the county high schools so if you are into exercising they have a nice track to run on and turf field you can use during non-school hours.

As someone else said, Stone Creek Village is nearby too and looks really nice. Not as good views but their pool is really nice.

Never heard of The Hudson but based on it's location I would definitely skip it. It's literally right beside a Tractor Supply, Auto Zone, CVS and a few auto repair shops. Not much of a feel to it and probably why I couldn't find any pictures on their website of the outside of the building or surroundings.

If you like going out and being around a lot to do then check out [Norcross Station](https://www.norcrossstation.net/) just off the downtown mall. It's in the heart of downtown and while I've never lived there I know friends who have and they have really enjoyed it. I believe their 1BR would be in your $1.5k range.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Coming to a new place I definitely would not sign a lease sign unseen but if it's too far for a day or even weekend trip to get a better feel of the apartment locations at the town then just do your due diligence. If you can't see them in person then use Google Street Views to see what's around the apartments you are looking at.

"If you actually knew anything about the situation it would make you laugh how wrong you are. Housing prices are high because of yes, partially a supply that isn't meeting demand. But to put this on people who are resistant to this particular project is disingenuous. 

The reason this is even a deal is because a rich land baron who has formed an LLC through his decades of buying out the area. He owns over 20% of the town of Scottsville's land. He squeezed the area - buying it all up, not allowing people to build and take advantage of the town. 

Now he (the company) wants special provisions because there is a housing shortage. THAT THEY CAUSED by buying out all of the land for decades and sitting on it. So yes - this is a microcosm for why we have a housing shortage - but it's because of greedy land barons that don't want anyone to have a good life unless they are the ones making a buck off of it.",t2_5cfc2,longhorn00x,0,1647890191.0,0,t1_i1kflmk,i1kflmk,False,rory096,t3_tiqn58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tiqn58/scottsville_town_council_to_vote_on_36house/,Scottsville Town Council to vote on 36-house development that spurred death threats running a councilor out of town,/r/Charlottesville/comments/tiqn58/scottsville_town_council_to_vote_on_36house/i1kflmk/,3,r/Charlottesville,0,3

"It's kind of a Catch-22.  

Why subscribe to the Daily Progress to read about. (lets look at the current top stories) a Housing project 30 miles away from me, a spelling bee, knitting for Ukraine, more Covid Stuff, the Festival of the Book, and last but not least....a relevant story: Non-Profit funding in the Cville Budget.   There's a tile for an Editorial, but I actively try to avoid opinion pieces if I can help it. 

In prior years, I have seen plenty of great stuff from the people that work there, and i absolutely sympathize with the situation of working for a media outlet not even based in our state who've hamstrung budgets and made local news very difficult.  

That said, there's little value (FOR ME) in the publication.  The Crime news in this town seems like nobody has heard of a police scanner.  I can't tell you how many ""articles"" i see that are obviously from some local business who has called in to say ""hey, we have a benefit for \[X Entity\] please give us some free advertisement disguised as press."" (The TV stations are very guilty of this too, and certain people in this town are notorious for doing it.) 

Honestly, some of the best local journalism has been coming out of Charlottesville Tomorrow. I wish they had a lot more coverage.

Charlottesville, VA - The Charlottesville Police Department has been informed that the Fry's Spring Beach Club was the site of a private event where a portion of the funds collected would be donated to a local nonprofit organization called Peace in the Streets.  
  
CPD would like to issue an apology to Peace in the Streets for being unable to clarify in the first release that they were a fundraising beneficiary, due to information provided early on in the investigation that indicated the group was listed on a flyer for the event, as well as an application to Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control for the event.

"So I was in a very similar situation. I spent 4 months bidding on houses to realize the market isn’t reasonable. So switched to apartments for the time being.

There is two prominent variables for apartments in cville I’m seeing. Proximity to downtown and recently of build are the driving factors for price. You are in the prime time for moving so you have that going for you. 

I spent a week just hitting every apartment complex getting tours of 90% of them. My experience is with 2 bedrooms, but i looked at all the pricing and layouts to keep an open mind.

Anything close to downtown and built within the last 15 years is going to be north of 1600 for a studio style apartment.

Then you can drop to 1300-1400 by moving away from downtown or getting something older.

All have 30-50 dollar for background and credit check.

I highly suggest doing virtual tours of the place you want. Getting pre qualified and on the list for the exact apartment you want because apartments are coming open now for June/July move ins.

As for the areas: it was grossly over exaggerated by my realtor how bad the “rough” areas are.

Charlottesville Police Officers responded to multiple calls for shots fired at the Fry Springs Beach Club at approximately 2:20 AM on 03/20/2022. Two adult males were shot during the incident and sustained non-life threatening injuries.  Both are reportedly in stable condition.  Forensic Technicians have recovered over 100 cartridge casings in the vicinity of the Fry Springs Beach Club.  The Charlottesville Police Department has been informed that the Fry Springs Beach Club was hosting an event for an organization called Peace in the Streets.  This investigation is ongoing.

"Several years ago there was funding for a remediation study for the City Yard, and I believe the Starr Hill Vision Plan that the city paid $500,000 included some update on that. I am not certain though.

[Let's look](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ojy_rRCyHLswUyxvj-lkajYT_UO-UDVg/view)!

The word ""remediation"" appears 17 times.

Here is one key passage:  


""If the City Yard property does not enroll in the Department of Environmental Quality’s Voluntary Remediation Program (VRP), [EPA Brownfields Grants](https://www.epa.gov/brownfields/types-brownfields-grant-funding) can be applied to support remediation efforts. In particular, a Cleanup Grant (of up to $500K) can be utilized for remediation purposes. Cleanup Grants can only be received once a site investigation report indicating what contaminants need to be cleaned up on the site, such as a Phase II, has been completed.""

There is a whole section on this on page 170.

""The mere presence of these materials at former \[Manufactured Gas Plant\] sites is not, however,  a necessary indication that a significant human or environmental threat is present. The existence of such a potential impact depends on the type, quantity, and nature of the material present. Also, such residues were often buried or otherwise separated from direct exposure pathways. These residues, therefore, usually do not present a direct contact hazard unless disturbed or exposed in some way or unless they have entered local groundwater or surface water.""

But the report also makes claims that the full environmental reports are not public documents.

This is the conclusion of this section:

""The consultant engaged for this recent review considered that achieving the goal of enrolling in and completing the VRP while maintaining an unrestricted land use scenario would involve deed restrictions likely including the prohibition of groundwater use and excavation restrictions, among others, but that a residential use would not likely be prevented.""

So I will now follow-up.",t2_d4l1z,adhonus,0,1647801443.0,0,t1_i1fnezd,i1fnezd,False,rollem,t3_thxhgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/thxhgb/protected_bike_lanes_make_streets_safer_for/,Protected bike lanes make streets safer for everyone (and shadows are worse than nothing),/r/Charlottesville/comments/thxhgb/protected_bike_lanes_make_streets_safer_for/i1fnezd/,3,r/Charlottesville,0,3

"Before I go forward, I will go back a little. When the developer of the Holsinger building was getting ready to build, an old timer reminded me that the parking lot that was going to be built upon had replaced the Greyhound Bus repair/fueling station. I mentioned this to the developer and he did some core samples and found nothing so began the dig. On the first day of excavating, one of the back worker passed out on his equipment due to toxic waste gas releases. So they had to have the entire site dug up and sent to the incinerator. 

The Public Works area will be much worse than that is the commonly held thought. From the Cville Weekly: ""The yard, home to black and mixed-race residents more than a century ago, was also the site of the city’s gas works. For decades, concerns about possible contamination kept its use limited to public works vehicles and maintenance facilities."" and ""So while many big hurdles remain—most notably whether the site needs environmental cleanup, and if so how much it will cost.""

Another interesting quote: ""Even if the site is not fit for housing, “What we’re doing is the worst thing we could possibly do,” Solla-Yates says. “Taxes are very important; the city needs tax revenue. City Yard is one of the most potentially valuable pieces of real estate in the city.”  
Yet, he adds, past City Councils have never taken the initiative to move redevelopment of the yard beyond the talking stage. But why?  
“I don’t know,” he says. “My suspicion is that it’s an ugly story and they don’t want to stir it up.”

""The Three Notched Trail (TNT) is a proposed paved, multi-use trail through Charlottesville, Ivy, and Crozet, over to the Blue Ridge Tunnel in Afton. Once built, the TNT will provide local residents and visitors with car-free transportation and recreational opportunities.  Additionally, the trail will connect users to the University of Virginia, the Blue Ridge Parkway, Shenandoah National Park, Skyline Drive, and the Appalachian Trail.""

"The problem with Charlottesville is that it's such a small city, almost every road has houses on it. It'd be easy to turn a commercial street into a pedestrian/bike friendly path. But the only streets that seem to qualify are E Market and Water (which parallel E Main, which has already been converted). You also have W Main, but the issue there is the is no good alternatives for vehicular traffic, and that is a critical road for  ambulances to UVa.

You might be able to do University Ave. I already avoid that road when I'm driving anyway. Of course there's a UVa faculty lot only accessable off University and the parking area for the corner are as well.

My city had dedicated two-wheel lanes (bikes and electric moped-style scooters), separated by a curb, trees, and often a metal fence, for just about every street. They were the width of a car lane in both directions. It was phenomenal. Quickest and most enjoyable (rainy and snowy days aside) way to get around.
