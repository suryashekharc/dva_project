"M59 can make for a totally MISERABLE commute.  It should have (and I believe plans were originally drawn up for it to have) been a freeway all the way from 75 to 94 as a sort of outer belt type freeway- opposition from Utica (afraid of the freeway killing the downtown) and Al Taubmann (who owned lakeside mall at the time and did not want his shiny new mall bypassed) nixed the idea.  Urban sprawl caused the cluster that it is now between Old Van Dyke and Garfield/Romeo Plank.   Used to commute half that distance (worked in Auburn Hills but didn't quite live as far east as Harrison Twp).  It'll probably be quicker in the morning, but coming home you'll have to either leave early, be prepared to sit in traffic, or stop in at one of the various chain restaurants along it for dinner or run errands.  There are other mile roads that you can kinda use to avoid 59 but they can get plugged as well due to various issues.

That said, while northern macomb county is definitely hard on the MAGA train, it's not ALL bad.  Metro Beach (Lake St Clair metropark ?) should be pretty rad, and being near the water can be nice aside from fish fly season (GROSS).    If you're into planes, Selfridge is nearby and I always thought it was cool to see military aircraft on exercises which happens enough to be interesting but not so much that the noise becomes a problem.  You're kinda near some of the apple orchards in the Romeo/Armada area - so fall can be fun.  94 is pretty much your only way of getting downtown, and it's almost always under construction, but when it's flowing it's a pretty quick jaunt for a concert or Lions/Wings/Pistons/Tigers game.  If you want to go to a nicer beach, you're only around an hour from some decent beaches on Lake Huron north of Port Huron.

Macomb gets a lot of hate on here (and for good reason at times) - but if you don't mind what it is at it's worst (very much cookie cutter suburbia and a large number of aging Boomer former Regan Democrats now mostly in the Maga camp along with some really trashy areas mixed in that give the worst of downriver a run for it's money) There can be good value and enjoyment to be had there.

"It's mostly people being miserable and also thinking it's this next huge thing. It's not. I've pointed out that Rivian has moved their headquarters constantly, has yet to do anything that warrants their hype, and that there's also a reason serious investor types are skeptical about investing in it. They announced a big loss despite still trying to increase production not too long ago.

There's also a small subset of Reddit users who worship tech to the point of cult behavior. Then there's also the subset who have left Detroit in 2009 and haven't been back except to visit and still base their views on that time frame. It'd be like me thinking NY is straight out the Warriors movie. I should add that Reddit also has a tendency to be detached from reality at times. 

Would it be cool if we had a new company headquartered here? Sure, but it's not the end of the world that they moved. I'd be more worried if several businesses and I mean several left Detroit in one fell swoop. Given that Huntington is basing their commercial banking here, I think we'll be ok.

"Here are the highlights from the article, I excluded the new state park in Flint and investments in the mobility industry.

Joe Louis Greenway

The bill contains a $60 million grant for Detroit to develop and build the Joe Louis Greenway, a 29-mile-long walking and biking trail throughout the city that will connect neighborhoods to the riverfront.

Lead line removal and home repairs

There’s $75 million for Detroit’s removal of lead water service lines in the city neighborhoods and $5.9 million for Flint to build a new water tower and make improvements to its water treatment system.
Mayor Mike Duggan’s administration also secured a $15 million appropriation for home repairs in Detroit and $5 million for energy bill assistance for Detroiters.

Freeway water pumps

Lawmakers appropriated $66 million requested by the Michigan Department of Transportation to purchase backup generators for 140 freeway drainage pump stations in metro Detroit. Last summer, several of these pumps failed when they lost electricity amid widespread power outages during intense storms.

Transit center

There’s $10 million for MDOT’s development of an intermodal transit center on Woodward Avenue in Detroit’s New Center neighborhood for buses and passenger trains to replace the city’s aging Amtrak station.

Infrastructure grants

The bill contains line-item grants through MDOT for general infrastructure improvements.
The grants include a $25 million grant for the Great Lakes Water Authority; a $25 million grant to the Wayne County Airport Authority, which runs Detroit Metro Airport; $4.0 million for freeway sound mitigation in Oakland County; $1 million for a freeway sound mitigation study in Wayne County; $2.15 million for an unspecified road project in Wayne County; and $350,000 for an unspecified sidewalk project in Oakland County.

Affordable housing

To address a shortage of housing for the so-called “missing middle” of wage earners, there’s a $50 million appropriation for the Michigan State Land Bank Authority to establish a fund to help developers defray the cost of building residential housing for households earning between 185 percent and 300 percent of the area median income.

Drinking water infrastructure

The bill appropriates $469.7 million in federal infrastructure funding toward the state’s revolving fund for municipalities to finance water infrastructure improvements. Cities in Southeast Michigan will be able to access the fund to finance water infrastructure construction projects.

Unemployment fund

Lawmakers made a $140 million deposit into the state’s Unemployment Trust Fund, which stood at $4.6 billion at the beginning of the pandemic two years and now has a balance of about $943 million. The money is meant to replenish the fund so that businesses are stuck with higher tax assessments to build up a surplus for the next economic recession.",t2_iz9ywg0h,Joe_Shiesty95,0,1648223911.0,0,t1_i22v7a0,i22v7a0,True,Joe_Shiesty95,t3_tnoyx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/tnoyx2/10_highlights_for_southeast_michigan_in/,10 highlights for Southeast Michigan in Legislature's $4.8 billion infrastructure bill,/r/Detroit/comments/tnoyx2/10_highlights_for_southeast_michigan_in/i22v7a0/,11,r/Detroit,0,11

"Pretty much everywhere is ""safe"" - you'd know it if you were in an area that wasn't, and you wouldn't consider living there. 

 If you're thinking about those western suburbs, you might like Northville; it's quaint with a little town square and near to Canton and Ann Arbor. 

Farmington in the downtown area is also kind of fun - The downtown has some restaurants/bars, a grocery, a record store, coffee shops, skate shop, etc. Some people will warn you from the area directly east of there however, for having too much petty crime.

I like West Dearborn for the same reasons, the area around Greenfield Village is nice.

West Bloomfield may be a good choice. It's very suburban, but not quite as sprawl-y and there are a fair amount of local/independent businesses. The area has a wide range of lifestyles, demographics, housing styles, price points, areas with lakes/trees, etc. There isn't really a downtown-type spot though.

"Highlights:

>“Detroit remains, in our view, on a trajectory to meet increasing pension costs in the near and long term within a balanced budget framework, and if it does so, we could raise the rating. We feel the city has fiscal discipline and flexibility that can keep it on track should it experience economic slowdowns or higher-than-forecasted pension increases,” states S&P’s report.

...

>The report further indicated the potential upside scenario for Detroit: “We could raise the rating over the next one-to-two years if the city sustains budgetary balance, including increasing pension contributions and not relying on reserves, and if we feel it is likely to continue to do so without deferring expenses or depleting the RPF at a rate that puts future budgets at increased risk.”",t2_d6vew9ve,bagleyboi,0,1648182905.0,0,t1_i20zzmv,i20zzmv,True,bagleyboi,t3_tne2i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/tne2i9/city_of_detroit_receives_upgraded_rating_from_sp/,City of Detroit Receives Upgraded Rating from S&P,/r/Detroit/comments/tne2i9/city_of_detroit_receives_upgraded_rating_from_sp/i20zzmv/,10,r/Detroit,0,10

"Canton and Ann Arbor could not be any more different. 

Canton is essentially a giant flat suburb with no personality whatsoever. Endless housing developments with needlessly curvy streets with names like “Whispering Oaks” and a grid of very busy five lane roads lined with strip malls and big box stores. No downtown, no central business district, no public transit. It is also very safe and very convenient for any type of shopping. It’s also significantly cheaper than Ann Arbor. 

Ann Arbor is a quintessential Midwest large college town with a very distinct downtown area with historic buildings, walkable shops and restaurants, theaters, museums, parks, etc. Outside of the downtown area you have more typical development, but it’s one of the best downtowns in the state. It’s frequently found on lists of best places to live in the entire country. The city definitely has problems, but there are a few places in the state that are more desirable to live, especially if you can afford it.

Taylor is like a white trash version of Canton.",t2_af3vy,TheBimpo,0,1648181174.0,0,t1_i20wwsh,i20wwsh,True,Gold-Screen-5211,t3_tndi9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/tndi9w/moving/,Moving?,/r/Detroit/comments/tndi9w/moving/i20wwsh/,16,r/Detroit,0,16

"Y’all are idiots, you don’t go to Millers to get a BBQ southwest burger with pulled pork or a burger with peanut butter or truffle. You can get all those burgers anywhere and they usually suck.

You really can’t go anywhere else to get a juicy burger where the cheese almost infused into the meat which it transforms into a velvety texture. The pickles and onions should be raw to give some crunch and acidity to the richness of the burger. If you want onion strings or pulled pork or 5 plus toppings on your burger go elsewhere…really a burger shouldn’t have more then lettuce, onion, tomato anything else really is just trying to make up for a lackluster beef, bun and cheese ratio. Also the price is the price. I’d pay even more like up to 12 bucks for a millers burger… over an over priced piled high burger that has ridiculous toppings.

"I love brooks and the dudes there, but that is not a great place to buy lumber.  (Or drywall, or anything in quantity really)

I don't mind paying a premium to shop there vs. home Depot, but when some common items (drywall, durabond, 2x4s, etc) are sometimes almost twice the price of a big box store, it's kind of tough.  I mean if I need one bag of durabond I'll pay $14 to save a drive to the burbs, but if I need a dozen bags? Sorry Brooks I gotta go pay $8 at home Depot.

"Here in Warren/Centerline we have Franco’s and Stosh’s both on Van Dyke between Stephens (9 1/2 mile) and 10 mile road. Franco’s has been around as long as I can remember and makes excellent Detroit style pizza with either sauce on top or bottom depending on your preference. Stosh’s opened up back when I was in High School in the 90’s I believe. They are very good as well. 

Another good one is Sorrento’s on 9 mile just east of Van Dyke. They have been around forever and a day and while some people say they aren’t as good as the old days I still find them good.

"I’ve written a lot about gentrification over the years but am not as familiar with Detroit as a case study. However, I will say that many people think it has to be one or the other. Either gentrification occurs and poor people get priced out/mom & pop businesses close, or everyone in poor communities just suffers for eternity. The onus doesn’t fall on new residents. The responsibility lies in part with developers who ought to consult with local neighborhood organizations and collaborate to create developments that are accessible to long-term residents, not strictly middle- to upper-class visitors. 

FWIW I am a transplant to Detroit from New Orleans. Some might call me a gentrifier and I understand why, but the truth is I pretty much got priced out of New Orleans because the cost of living there has become so insane.

"See, there it is again. If you can't afford to move somewhere, you haven't been displaced. Have I been displaced because I can't afford to live in Beverly Hills, CA? Displacement is when you live somewhere and you're forced to leave because it's too expensive. Sure, rent increases can make it unaffordable for people, but that's always been true (and new housing can put downward pressure on rents too). Anyone who actually owns their house, though, is not getting displaced by anyone. Like I said, if my neighbors sell their house for a trillion dollars, how would that lead to me losing my own house? How would it ""displace"" me? Like, cause and affect, by what mechanism?

>...new construction keeps poor people from even moving in...

No, high demand and low supply, and the fact that poor people, by definition, don't have a lot of money, keeps poor people from moving in. There is nothing magical about new construction that makes it expensive. In fact, it costs about the same to build the same house everywhere. New construction tends to happen in desirable neighborhoods (think Corktown or West Village) first, which are already expensive because they're desirable places to be. A lot of people are all bidding for the same limited housing. Who wins?

"A few years ago the city did a study on transportation downtown, mostly focusing on improving the streets. So cleaning up the messy intersections, changing things from one way to two way, etc. I think that the improved intersection at Randolph and Gratiot was one of them. In that plan, iirc they call for pedestrianizing Monroe over that stretch. All it really does is clog things up for the streets that intersect it, and there's very clear demand for the extra pedestrian space.

Greektown (the business district, not the casino, although I imagine the casino was involved) also did some planning, and iirc they also have called for it to be pedestrianized. They also want the parking lots replaced with buildings.

So as far as I know everyone is on the same page and wants it to happen, and yet it hasn't happened. idk what's really going on, since to me, Greektown, and downtown in general, is both heavily visited by Detroiters and is also an important part of Detroit's economy and tax base, and so to me I would think they would prioritize it and get some people to do the paperwork and get a pilot for pedestrianizing it started (restriping, covering signage, put up barriers) to at least get it started. And then at some point in the future when there's money, full new streetscaping can be done. But it can still be pedestrianized tastefully without a full streetscaping. There aren't any parking garage entrances on Monroe, and the handful of parking lots can still easily be accessed from other streets. And pedestrianizing Monroe would also simplify Randolph which is one of downtown's problem roads.

Edit: I was actually incorrect and neither actually say to pedestrianize Monroe, but I swear I've heard that Greektown wanted to pedestrianize it. :/

"I guess I disagree with that because I don't think most people who are against gentrification consider ""inability to purchase a house nearby"" as displacement. They talk about displacement as being ""forced from your home"". I.e. you have a place to live, but things get too expensive and you have to leave. I've never heard anyone talk about displacement as just being unable to buy into your neighborhood if you had to do it again today. Why would you do that if you already live there anyway? And why would it make you any worse off? If the neighbor's house is going for 350, yours is probably not far off either. (This is actually an unpleasant surprise for people who want to sell when the market is ""hot"", because they find out that they also have to buy when the market is ""hot"".) Maybe you don't get ""retire to Florida"" money, but you can always downsize and then have a sizable nest egg or something.

"You're conflating renting and owning. Yes, rent increases can cause people to be unable to afford their housing. Renters always have less power in these situations because of how renting works.

Owners, though, cannot be priced out. If you own a house, you will continue to pay the same amount (if you so choose) for the life of the loan, regardless of who comes or goes in your neighborhood.

>If someone already owns a house and wants to move, but cannot find anything in that community because housing prices have skyrocketed, they are displaced

That's not displacement. They already have a house, so what, exactly, is someone else doing that is forcing them to leave?

>...but when the literal 3 bedroom/1 bath crackhouse down the street from me sold for $350k to a flipper who is going to turn around and sell it for even more... that raises some eyes about affordability for the people who have been in that area forever and want to stay...

"You can't control which areas become desirable, unless you take some current political thinking to its logical conclusion and deliberately ruin a neighborhood so it stays ""cheap"". The (apparently untenable) alternative is to build more housing. If rents go up because landlords can charge more for rent, then why not build more commercial space? The demand is clearly present. Then, you get more businesses anyway, a stronger neighborhood, _and_ it puts downward pressure on prices.

>So if the selection of houses to own is decreasing, and prices are going up, you don't have hope to stay in that area if you outgrow your current place/want to move. Causing lower income people to have to look elsewhere (other low income areas) if they need a new place to live.

Except this isn't displacement. Nobody is entitled to be able to afford every house in every neighborhood. I know some people would disagree, but I think you'll find the vast majority of people are okay with the idea that there are some homes that are simply out of reach. (Sometimes, for good reasons. A roof in Indian Village can easily cost $100,000 to replace.) If you already own a house in a ""gentrifying"" place, at least in Michigan, you cannot be priced out. Prop A was explicitly created to prevent that, and it mostly works.

Expensive housing is not some new phenomenon, it just feels particularly pressing because we haven't built a glut of housing or commercial space in decades. What did we expect would happen when more and more people (with more resources) all have to bid for the same, limited space?

I think this is hard for people because I've noticed that a lot of the folks who cry foul over gentrification are also vehemently opposed to the idea of privately buying and selling land in the first place (something about capitalism), so any arguments that rely on housing supply and demand fall flat. Some people simply don't like that the idea that there is some housing that is unaffordable for some people. I want everyone to have a place to live, but if your neighborhood becomes ""hot"", why is anyone entitled to a house there? There are plenty of other places to live.

I don't foresee the private land market going away any time soon, though, so I would suggest that anyone who is uncomfortable with private land sales get used to working within that system.",t2_d6vew9ve,bagleyboi,1,1648054045.0,0,t1_i1tddlr,i1tddlr,False,The70th,t3_tkwku5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/tkwku5/in_detroit_gentrification_but_downriver_lets_call/,"In Detroit, gentrification.

"You accept that neighborhoods change. Build no new housing and the rich will inevitably price out everyone else. Allow for more housing to be built and the physical neighborhood will change (as well as its composition), but it will remain more affordable to local residents and [experience less displacement](https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/where-did-all-the-black-people-in?s=r). 

IMO local government should be doing more to allow long present Detroiters to prosper alongside neighborhood growth. Lower income POCs often have less access to traditional funding avenues and banks are more hesitant to give loans to start businesses. Detroit should scale up Motor city Match and bolster programs like Hatch Detroit to fill this gap and ensure inevitable growth is more equitable.

The reality is that without money, or a reason to give a fuck about Detroit (like ""my job is here""), nobody will come here. Cities aren't fantasy lalalands where everyone just holds hands and sings. Most people need jobs, and most people are going to live near their jobs.

Don’t even try at the ski resorts, one time I bought lunch for our crew and 2 pizzas + 2 orders of wings came out to be $80. Thankfully I could expense it, but that was insane.

I do agree Detroit is replacing Chicago. Just because theyre both gimmicky.

"I mean Blue Pan is good - I just don’t believe their product justifies the prices they charge. I think Blue Pan leans heavily into Detroit style being a novelty of sorts, and charges more than I’d be willing to pay to eat it regularly. I’m not saying they don’t make good pizza, it’s just a bit overrated in my opinion. I grew up with Detroit style being cheap and easy to feed a lot of people (regularly had football team parties at Shields and Buddy’s in Warren growing up), so $30+ for a large pie seems a lot to me.  
  
I say go there once or twice, same with the Colorado-style chain, Beau Jo’s. Beau Jo’s is good in the “Colorado-style” (all that means is thick crust on the edges that you tear off and eat separately, dipped in honey). It just doesn’t justify the cost when there’s places that are decent and much much cheaper.  
  
I grew up in Rochester and went to school in Warren, so I’m a bit picky when it comes to this new trend. Pretty much every party store between where my extended family lived in Grosse Pointe/Harper Woods and where we lived in Rochester, had solid square pizza. This in addition to the regular chains like Jet’s, Buddy’s, and others, as well as a few local places like Mr C’s, Papparoni’s in Fraser/Roseville (they used to supply the De La Salle sports games), or Buscemi’s.
