"Zazah is a sweet and loving dog who is the perfect medium-size. This adorable pup will steal your heart with her big puppy dog eyes and happy tail wags. Her foster reports that she is very affectionate and loves to sit on the couch for cuddles and pets. Zazah has been getting along wonderfully with her foster sister and adores her. They love to wrestle, and Zazah’s signature move is jumping from the couch to pounce on her big sister. She is still a little wary of the outside world and strangers, so she will need a patient owner who can provide treats, encouragement, and continued training to build her confidence. In return, she will provide you with unconditional love and joy.

"Me and my neighbors did something I’m quite proud of. I started care for my child at 12mos. with a full time nanny I found on Care.com. We ended up loving her, and were able to start a part-time nanny share with one neighbor. Then, another neighbor liked our set up, so we did a nanny-share for 3. Finally, one other neighbor really wanted to get in on the action. So we found a neighbor who was looking to move out and rent out his home. He was excited to hear that we wanted to start a home daycare for the neighborhood toddlers. About a month later, our nanny completed home daycare licensing with Alameda County, moved in down the street, and voila! Each family pays $2,000/mo for 8am-5pm care, including food. This is the infant price, so once the kiddos are 2+, the allowed ratio of kids will go up to 6-8 kids per carer, and price can decrease. It worked out for all of us because she was already looking for a place to stay and all of us neighborhood parents just have to go right next door to drop off our kid. I especially love that the kids will grow up together and that we parents can stop by whenever we please (most of us work from home).",t2_94asj,mintchippyfry50,0,1647916829.0,0,t1_i1m54u3,i1m54u3,True,KATEWM,t3_tjgqd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/tjgqd1/anyone_have_experience_with_local_daycares/,Anyone have experience with local daycares?,/r/eastbay/comments/tjgqd1/anyone_have_experience_with_local_daycares/i1m54u3/,6,r/eastbay,0,6

"I don't know what a large university provides that equals the experience of a small liberal arts school. At Mills, the average class size is around 10-15 students. You won't see that at Berkeley until you hit upper division classes. 

More importantly, Mills is a women's college with 58% queer students, 66% students of color, and 41% first-generation college students. A majority of students have disabilities, although I don't think they've given a specific stat for that. 

People don't understand what that's like. We had a queer alum call a few months ago where it took us at least an hour, maybe two, to put it into words. When we did, people said things like: 

""People don’t know what to do with \[us\], and when they don’t know what to do, they react in a hostile way. When i got to Mills, I was in an environment that didn’t go RAAWWWWK every time I moved.”

""Mills is the one place where -- We’re expected to make ourselves smaller, you know? But Mills is a place where we’re not expected to do that. You’re supposed to the the biggest you you can be.""

"The thing is, the deficit is only on paper. 

More than 90% of their stated deficit over all those years is pure depreciation. It's tax write-offs, not bills they paid.

Their revenues have grown over that same period of time. The endowment has grown. All they have to do is stop overspending on upper administration, and they'll have money to burn. 

As for the education not being popular... 50 years ago, enrollment was steady at about 1000-1100 total student body every year. That held true up until 2005, when they had a record enrollment of more than 1200. 

And they kept breaking their own record for 8 years, all the way up to 1600. Until one of their overpaid, unnecessary VPs cut the Admissions team that had been so successful.

"If you are considering going by car, Listen to the morning traffic report for about a week and pay attention to when the bay bridge metering lights go on.

Their returns have been crap since they switched from Cambridge Associates to Hall Capital. They also pay twice as much in management fees. But they did make a solid $49M in returns last year, the same fiscal year that they announced they had to close.

"Depending on how close work is to Bart and your lifestyle preferences...farther east is where I grew up.  The Concord to Pleasanton corridor on 680.

But a car is required for life out there.  However, you can hop on Bart and be in el cerrito in 30 min from Walnut Creek.

"If someone says you have a debt owed, you go to creditkarma and check your credit report. If you see something on there that shouldn't be, you put in a petition to have it removed. The debt-holder now has to provide proof that you owe this debt. Most likely they cannot do that, and then the debt is taken off your record. There are a lot of scams like this -- when you go and check your report it is entirely clean--do not engage with the collector! As someone else pointed out, you could turn the illegitimate debt into a real debt by saying it is real on the phone or worse by making a payment on it. You do that and now they have the proof they need to put it on your report. 

Never engage with debt collectors! 

Your credit report is legally free for you at least once a year, so even if you don't want to do credit karma, you can get the information for free. You can also petition the credit agencies directly to remove things that shouldn't be on there, credit karma just makes it really easy and they're pretty widely used.

Continuing...
You are not going very far.
Your utility that had no problem delivering dependable electricity for 100 years now shuts you down when the wind blows.
Then you go nowhere. 
Do the math...
Or can you?
When you convert energy from one form to another some is lost. Frequently a lot. 10% -20% is a round number. Makes easy math, but it's rounded down,  a  lot. 

How many times is juice converted BEFORE it moves an elect car?
We are going from chemical energy to mechanical energy in both cases.
Today's cars do it in 1 step.  On Board. Without the toxic batteries that only provide 1/2 of what they claim after only a few weeks. 
Elect made from gas at a power plant is 1 conversion.
Don't even try to say wind or solar... see documentary PLANET OF THE HUMANS if you still buy those lies,
Then they have to transform it to high voltage   2 & usually DC 3 TO transport it to the substation by your home. 
Them it has to be stepped back down  to voltage that your home can use 4 &  Probably converted back to AC 5.
Then your charging station  at your home converts  from 240 volts AC elect & converts to 12volts DC 6  stored in chemical energy in your ""charged"" batterys, 7 then it has to be converted from chemical to electric to finally power your electric moters 8 
that then convert it to mechanical to turn the wheels 9.

"I work in lending.  This is strange and bad advice.  If you owe a debt and don't pay it, it will damage your credit.  That's how the entire system works.  It is the only leverage a lender has over you (excluding liens/repossession for houses, car loans, etc.).

This nonsense script won't change that, and it won't stop the next agent from calling you 2 days from now.  The first agent will end the call, 2 days will go by, and the computer will put your number back in the collections system for another agent to dial.

Agents have to call 500 people a day and don't control who they call.  It's not like they're going to say ""that guy was crazy, don't dial him again"", it's all systematized.

Additionally, you claiming something is legally binding doesn't make it so, and agents deal with enough crazy people that they get legal mumbo-jumbo garbage a lot.  Look up Sovereign Citizens to get an idea of how crazy some people can be.

&#x200B;

**OP, go figure out if you owe something or if this is a scam.**  It looks like you're pretty close to having that locked down.  If you owe it and want it off your credit, act on it.  If the collections agent is legit, they likely can help you in the following ways - 

\- payment plan if you can't make the owed amount up front/want to pay it down over time

\- a settlement of the total if the account is VERY old (this will still hurt your credit, but less so than not paying)

\- an arrangement to stop receiving collections calls to give you time to pay off the debt

**If you believe it's a scam...**

\- Block the number

**If you believe the lender/entity is real but the debt isn't yours/you don't owe it...**

\- Reach out to the company/entity claiming you owe the debt.

\- If it's identity theft (someone pretended to be you, took money, now a company says you owe it) you will be required to file a police report for identity theft and show it to the company.  Upon doing that, they should remove the debt from your credit report.  The police report is intentionally the legal bar chosen by a lender because filing a false police report is illegal.

**Note:** It's much, much more effective in cases of suspected fraud to reach out to a company directly than to dispute your credit score indirectly.  Those requests get taken seriously, disputing through the credit bureaus are not as much due to the amount of frivolous disputes that go through that channel.",t2_70vnbd4u,Low_Inspection_3041,0,1646870378.0,0,t1_i01ibnd,i01ibnd,False,Journeyoflightandluv,t3_tagimy,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/tagimy/is_anyone_else_getting_calls_from_a_collections/,Is anyone else getting calls from a Collections Law firm that feels like a scam?

That's easy enough to figure out. Call the California Franchise Tax board and ask them if they see this demand for payment, judgement, etc. attached to your name and pay it if it exists. If they refer you to the County Superior Court, then let that person give you the phone number.  Don't just pull it off of that letter without double checking.

>Im making payments now to the first Law firm and now another Law Firm left me a message saying I have a legal judgement against me. I called its a Adamson Law firm out of LA. They are saying I owe BofA over $10,000.00 for a Credit card I didnt pay off.

Get ahold of the three agencies - Trans Union, Experian, Equifax. Sounds like you're already aware, but you're entitled to one free credit report from each of them annually. If you see this judgement against it, then you should go about paying it.

So you've got two things here - the $856.00 and the potential $10,000. The first one sounds more cut and dry than the second. In any event, make sure you get a receipt from these people when you pay them.

>Has anyone here dealt with this kind of thing

Not personally, but I used to work in lending, so I'm familiar with the processes to get these things paid off. The $10k sounds totally fishy to me. You're supposed to get those things in writing, not over phone calls.

"West Contra Costa Unified is highly variable. Some schools are fine. Some are a total mess. In our area the middle school has a lot of issues, the high school is ok, and the elementary school is pretty good and has a principal that’s very popular with families.

I would look up the attendance areas on the district website and then ask online via Reddit, Facebook, etc what families in the areas you’re interested in think of their schools.

I know a lot of families who do transfers within WCCUSD to get out of a bad school in their attendance area and into a better one in another area. And some families even do inter-district transfers to neighboring districts like Albany and Berkeley but those are generally harder.

There are also a ton of charter schools but those can be highly variable just like the district schools and require just as much research.

LMAO, and read the actual STUDY and not just the article summarizing it for halfwits. You and the study author are ignoring that the major problem is that in most of the muggings that happen in the Bay Area targeting Asians the perpetrators are never charged with hate crimes because our local DAs are cowards. 

Out of dozens of racially targeted attacks only one might ever be charged as a hate crime around here.

I fish for large mouth at chabot with mostly topwater baits - frogs and poppers. I'm not really a trout guy. for catfish I just tie a High/Low rig with a 2oz sinker, and chicken livers held onto the hooks with magic thread. Cast it in and let it soak! 

Out in the bay, I don't use any lures. Just live or cut baits. My favorite is live anchovie. I just tie a hook right to the line, hook the bait through the head and let it drift around near pilings. On 7 of 10 casts, as the bait drifts past a piling or structure I'll get a hit from striped bass.",t2_4o1mhlbw,SqueakyHuevos,0,1646461094.0,0,t1_hzf7h8r,hzf7h8r,False,Runic112,t3_t6s2av,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/t6s2av/best_east_bay_shore_fishing/,Best East Bay shore fishing?,/r/eastbay/comments/t6s2av/best_east_bay_shore_fishing/hzf7h8r/,1,r/eastbay,0,1

"San Pablo kiiinda sucks... At least in the years I've been there.

The Bio Mass in the bay isn't much better near shore, but fish, skates and shark can still be had.

One of my favorite spots for bank/shore fishing is Rock Wall in Alameda. Get set up on a fast incoming tide and your good for striper on the topwater using anchovies or pile worns, skates and shark using a High/low off the bottom with the same bait. You'll find that the 2 most common baits for saltwater here in the bay area are Pile worm and Anchovy. Smelt also work, but not as effectively.

On clear, mild days with little to no winds, I run a small trout treble and a bobber with pieces of pile worm for jacksmelt.

There's also Berkeley pier, but you'll be fishing off the rocks as the pier is long closed. San Leandro marina allows fishing, but you won't catch much there. There used to be a few spots by the Benicia and Richmond/San Rafael  bridges for sturgeon, but it's been years since I've been there.

For fresh water, try lake chabot in Castro Valley. Check their website for when they stock the lake. They have stocked trout, naturally occurring catfish, black bass, large and small mouth bass, and croppie.

Also hit Quarry Lakes in Fremont. Same situation as lake chabot. 

The most common baits at Quarry or Chabot are chartreuse power bait, salmon eggs, yellow rooster tails or any bass bait",t2_4o1mhlbw,SqueakyHuevos,0,1646442023.0,0,t1_hze5ahl,hze5ahl,True,Runic112,t3_t6s2av,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/t6s2av/best_east_bay_shore_fishing/,Best East Bay shore fishing?,/r/eastbay/comments/t6s2av/best_east_bay_shore_fishing/hze5ahl/,4,r/eastbay,0,4

"Exactly - Emeryville was a dump until Pixar decided to move in and put in that campus.

"Man, I'm not a nimby - I support development and densification projects across the bay and California. In fact it's a fundamental part of my career. And that gives me a perspective that *absolutely* city departments are stretched ridiculously thin. Projects and programs are constantly cut, delayed, or downsized. There are *never* enough resources to meet department goals. I should say too, that I'm generally disillusioned with small government efficiency, but they are by no mean overfunded, or whatever you're trying to insinuate. I do get the opportunity to regularly interact with members of the public like you though, who only have their one baby priority in mind and can't grasp that as a society we need to balance competing priorities.

Also, I could point to a number of redevelopment projects that have occurred in the city, and are specifically targeted for students. That is driven by developers and overseen by the city, but the University has tried to claim it as somehow working towards their own housing development goals. 

Anyways, I feel this has gotten away from the main point.

"Please help spread the word about Grizz, a 1-year old puppy who has been at Berkeley Animal Care Services since November. He is a fantastic dog who doesn’t show well in the shelter (he barks and jumps on his kennel door for attention), but he is truly a lovable sweetheart. This energetic youngster is excited to find an active home who will take him on hikes and other adventures. Grizz is a friendly fellow who loves to meet people, and volunteers have been working with him to teach him some basic tricks and manners. He's a great option for someone who is looking forward to training games with their new pup. Grizz also enjoys playing with toys and other dogs. He loves to zoom around the playroom with friends, which doubles as great exercise and fun for him. He can be selective about doggie friends because he is a little insecure, so he will sometimes bark at passing dogs when out on walks; however, volunteers have been working with him to pass politely and have been having success. Please help spread the word about Grizz so he can find his forever home! You meet Grizz at Berkeley Animal Care Services, located at 1 Bolivar Drive in Berkeley, CA.

"I did this commute for two years, from Rockridge to Pleasanton and later Glenview to Pleasanton during Covid (so maybe once every two weeks). It’s very easy going with a car, there’s usually a bit of a slow down where the 580 and 238 merge around Castro Valley but it keeps moving. Other than that it’s really straightforward and never more than 35 minutes, usually 25 highway to highway. Similar in reverse on the way back. With a car commute you can live in all the great neighborhood of Oakland: Temescal, Rockridge, Piedmont (not Oakland), Montclair, Glenview, Grand lake and either grab the 580 or the 13. 

The BART in my opinion isn’t the greatest unless you live close to the blue line. Otherwise it can be 1.5 hours and you catch the SF commuter craziness (Covid notwithstanding) until you can transfer downtown or in west Oakland. Also it depends on where your work is located compared to the BART station - if you can bike it’s great but still all-told you’re looking at 1h15m or more.

I also play soccer and go climbing. You can catch some good pickup games in Linda Beach Play fields in Piedmont on saturdays (check meet up). Otherwise literally any field in San Leandro with the Latinos. Climbing at Berkeley Ironworks (and other touchstone gyms; like Great Western which is very accessible) is awesome but you’ll likely need to drive or bike. Touchstone also has a new bouldering gym that opened up somewhere near Jack London that’s supposedly really good if Bouldering is your jam and you end up deciding to live near the blue line.",t2_p2ccq,ErnieBLegal,0,1644982215.0,0,t1_hx4lsv3,hx4lsv3,True,BetramaxLight,t3_st6oca,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/st6oca/live_in_oakland_work_in_pleasanton_w_bart/,"Live in Oakland, Work in Pleasanton w/ BART?",/r/eastbay/comments/st6oca/live_in_oakland_work_in_pleasanton_w_bart/hx4lsv3/,2,r/eastbay,0,2

"oakland is where you want to live. maybe berkeley, but the commute would be longer. there are a few neighborhoods you could consider. sounds like anything around lake merritt sounds like it would fit your lifestyle.

I lived in adams point in my mid 20's and enjoyed it, but there are enough comments about the area so here's my thoughts on the nearby touchstone climbing gyms.

oakland:

GWPC in uptown - directly across the street from 19th st BART, so might be convenient for you. street parking is whack here. small gym, small bouldering section. honestly I think the setting here is slightly better though for some reason, ymmv.

pacific pipe in west oakland - brand new gym, absolutely massive. parking lot makes it convenient, but it does fill up. just enormous, seriously check it out it's yuge and they have it all. also have a taco truck parked outside sometimes.

berkeley:

ironworks - it's where the university kids are at, I used to climb here a lot before pacific pipe opened because it also has parking unlike GWPC. nice gym, near berkeley bowl (groceries) which some people obsess over. also next to urban ore (thrift/recycle store) which is cool.

SF:

dogpatch - if you want to boulder this is the spot. I used to drive on weekends to boulder at dogpatch before they opened pacific pipe and it is still worth the trip, imo. when you get bored of the same set, anyway. there is a bagel place next door that is good too, but idk you're from the east coast sooo

mission cliffs - tbh I don't go here all that often, because it's not worth the trip to SF over just going to ironworks (or now pacific pipe). another nice gym, mostly toprope/lead.

anyway, imo all of the touchstone gyms set a little soft. doesn't matter, they still have great climbs. as for non-touchstone gyms it is worth checking out planet granite in SF, I used to be absolutely psyched to get to climb there maybe like 10-15 years ago when I was a teen. not worth a membership though if you are living in the east bay. there is another gym in SF called benchmark that I have never been to, but it looks expensive and new. in el cerrito there is bridges, which is probably the cheapest membership in the area and also way worth it (their setting is good, gym is small though).",t2_4m57m,eekabomb,0,1644962820.0,0,t1_hx3da1s,hx3da1s,True,BetramaxLight,t3_st6oca,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/st6oca/live_in_oakland_work_in_pleasanton_w_bart/,"Live in Oakland, Work in Pleasanton w/ BART?",/r/eastbay/comments/st6oca/live_in_oakland_work_in_pleasanton_w_bart/hx3da1s/,2,r/eastbay,0,2

"I have lived in Oakland for 21 years commuting on Bart to SF.  I also graduated HS in the San Ramon Valley with family still there, so feel I can speak from experience of the plan you are hatching.  

The Oakland Bart stops are not safe - Bart police try, but they can’t keep up and are stretched thin.  Especially Coliseum, Fruitvale and West Oakland stops get worse the further outside commute hours you get.  Parking your car at Bart will likely end up with your catalytic converter stolen or your car broken in to.  If you are GOING to Pleasanton, you have a reverse commute already which is great!  I honestly recommend you just plan to live near to work and get a car.  I assume you want to live in Oakland to be closer to nightlife in Oakland and SF?  You won’t want to BART to do those things at night anyway unless you have a group to travel with.  Which brings me to the work commute.  Rental housing in Bay Area is expensive. No real “cheap” places to live.  Best bet is to bite the bullet and just live near to where you work. Your time and safety are worth more than your $$.  If you still want to continue with the BART plan, then I recommend living in Castro Valley or San Leandro and taking bart from there - East.  I am close to both stops presently and would be a possible solution to minimize security concerns and time/expense.

"BARTing from Oakland to Pleasanton is going against traffic, so it shouldn’t be a full, standing room only situation.    
By car, it can get backed up once you reach the Castro Valley area on 580 (or on 238, depending on your route).

"Dan, I appreciate your reply very much, really, thank you, I suspect you are missing some caveats though.

""+ PG&E will charge you the same minimum delivery fee for delivery, regardless of the generation provider. ""  


While that is ""true"", I feel like that is not the whole truth, because the (net) charge is not always a fixed \~$10, it can be offseted (lowered) by other means. PG&E statement is:

""The Minimum Delivery Charge is billed monthly and \_credited\_ at True-Up \_if the total NEM Charges Before Taxes or total State Mandated Non-Bypassable Charges are greater than your cumulative Minimum Delivery Charges\_"". 

So while the rate of Minimum Delivery Charge is the same no matter it is EBCE or PG&E, whether (some of) it gets credited back when NEM charges is greater makes the difference. EBCE generation charges does not get counted towards "" total NEM Charges Before Taxes"", but PG&E's generation charges does, (at least based on how I read my bill cause I don't see any of EBCE generation charges get added to my ""total NEM Charges"". Makes sense, EBCE has its own true up schedule as you've described). 

The key point here is, the more charges there is from PG&E, the more likely the ""total NEM Charges Before Taxes"" will exceed ""Minimum Delivery Charge""s and thus offsetting them (or zero'ing it out, making it free), which makes sense, because PG&E on top of generation charges, is already charging for delivery (the double charge I kept talking about).

While EBCE is offering generation at a $0.01 discount (I believe) per kWh as shown in your math (which is also accounted for in my example), I believe it is not enough to offset the extra delivery charges I discribed in my original example. Of course, if you incur so much PG&E charges that your total PG&E NEM will exceed the Minimum Delivery Charge regardless of EBCE or not, then this is a mood point. But as I have described, I would think most installers would size their systems for the case I original described.

I wonder if EBCE accountants are missing this fine point... perhaps EBCE accountants should take a second look at the math I have illustrated (yes, again, I agree not all customers will hit always hit that case, but seems to be a good enough reason to not go for EBCE).",t2_gjy0sidb,backserum,0,1644746676.0,0,t1_hwrfpqw,hwrfpqw,False,backserum,t3_s2uj96,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/s2uj96/solar_east_bay_community_energy_any_experience/,"Solar + East Bay Community Energy, any experience there?",/r/eastbay/comments/s2uj96/solar_east_bay_community_energy_any_experience/hwrfpqw/,1,r/eastbay,0,1

"So a lot of the comments can be summed up in two words. And I shit you not those two words are:

Gourmet Ghetto.

[It's got it's own yelp page](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_loc=Gourmet+Ghetto%2C+Berkeley%2C+CA) and I lived right in the middle of it for 5 years and never got tired of the food. My wallet is another story for another day.  Key reason for that that some have mentioned is that most places change their menu either monthly or daily. The sandos at The Local Butcher Shop, the pizza at Cheeseboard change daily and the menu at Gregoire's is monthly, except the potato puffs, which seriously....get the potato puffs....get one more order of the potato puffs then you think you're gonna eat. They're all decent about updating their websites so check that shit before you show up. You don't wanna get to Cheeseboard and find out it's a potato based pizza that day. But if they got a corn pizza, you wait in that line damn it!  

Also if you do decide to slum it [in the ghetto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ox1Tore9nw) on Thursday they have the farmers market and if the taquitos stand is still there, get the taquitos.

Ok but on to you criteria because I got sidetracked thinking about that pizza(seriously it's so good, it was about a year till I realized they never had meat or sauce on the pizza.)   


Easy parking exists in the Gourmet Ghetto....If you're lucky or good or reallllly patient. By good, I mean to say that if you're not parking in a metered spot on Shattuck, you better be able to parallel park in a spot 3 inches shorter than your than your car is long. Or you can also just not give a fuck and park in safeway's parking lots(it's been awhile so not sure how their enforcement is these days). If you find a spot to park then you'll be within a block of a great spot to eat, no question. But if you're looking for a places where you can show up in a moving van and actually be able to find a spot then in the words of George Berkeley,

*""Westward the course of empire takes its way.""*

Just put a giant X over downtown and head for the ocean. You got good odds of finding parking along san pablo ave and there's some damn good food there too. Cafe Leila is one of my favorites and fits your criteria. It's just far enough between University and Gilman that street parking exists and while  you can't see it from the street the back patio is hella big, but [still very cozy](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-leila-berkeley-2?select=xE4KUi5nwG-qhd16p3F5YQ&utm_campaign=www_photo_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)).

"Let me do the math in response to EBCE's comments.

Lets consider the following scenario, it may sound like an made up edge case , I believe this is common, this is how solar installers size the systems to minimize monthly bill.  
  
PGE charges $0.30 per kWh, of which $0.11 is production  
EBCE charges $0.10 per kWh for production  
  
To simplify, my usage and my panels production time conicide perfectly (eliminate peak vs off peak complication not relevant here) and is exactly the same each month:  
\* my panels produce 67kWh per month consistently  
\* I use 100kWh per month consistenty  
  
With PGE only  
\* PGE charges me $10 a month for the 33kWh I use net (thats the 100kWh usage - 67kWh solar production)  
\* Trued up, I pay $120 a year  
\* I don't think I am paying PGE minimum delivery charge because I am paying PGE $10 a month already (the amount $10 is just an example, we can adjust to $10.20, $11, whatever, accordingly)  
  
With PGE and EBCE  
\* EBCE charges $3.30 a month for production (of the 33kWh I use net)  
\* PGE charges $6.27 a month for delivery (for the 33kWh net)  
\* Trued up  
  \+ I pay $(3.3 + $6.27) x 12 = $114.84  
  \+ PGE also charges me 3.73 x 12 = $44.76 minimum delivery charge  
  \+ so grand total is $114.84 + $44.76 which is $160 which is more than without EBCE  
    
The ""double charge"" I was referring to was PGE charging in my example $0.19 delivery charge per kWh what EBCE produces, plus the minimum delivery charge.

Bottom line though I would leave EBCE if indeed I pay less with PGE only, there is really no reason to stay.",t2_gjy0sidb,backserum,0,1644433976.0,0,t1_hw9gp9t,hw9gp9t,True,backserum,t3_s2uj96,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/s2uj96/solar_east_bay_community_energy_any_experience/,"Solar + East Bay Community Energy, any experience there?",/r/eastbay/comments/s2uj96/solar_east_bay_community_energy_any_experience/hw9gp9t/,1,r/eastbay,0,1

"Essentially setting up a LOCAL AG vs INTERNATIONAL/EVERYTHING container exchange site.  Excellent. 

>The port is setting up what it's calling a ""popup site"" where trucks can easily and quickly pick up empty shipping containers.

"About Mortie: This lovable dude showed up to the shelter with some scars and a poorly cropped, crooked tail, but his past has not affected his demeanor. Mortie is a volunteer favorite because of his happy attitude and goofy personality.

We introduced him to other shelter dogs, and he was enthusiastic and ready to play, so he could be an option for a multi-dog home. When hanging out with our volunteers, Mortie is the type to stick his big ol’ head in your lap for some pets or lean against you for butt scritches.

"They used to live in the parking lot of a plant nursery that had other cats and allowed dogs inside. They never fought with any of the other animals that lived there or visited, they tended to just keep to themselves. In their current situation there is a dog that doesn't know how to behave himself around cats, hence them being kept in the back room you can see in the photos, but even when the cats see the dog the cats seem to be fine as long as the dog keeps his distance. As for cats, there were other cats at this business, but each group kept to certain areas of the nursery and only really socialized within their group, in this case the group was these two siblings.",t2_4nozk578,DrWyrm87,0,1643743939.0,0,t1_hv68xcq,hv68xcq,False,DrWyrm87,t3_sho51n,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastbay/comments/sho51n/formerly_feral_sibling_cars_looking_for_forever/,Formerly Feral Sibling Cars Looking For Forever Home,/r/eastbay/comments/sho51n/formerly_feral_sibling_cars_looking_for_forever/hv68xcq/,1,r/eastbay,0,1
