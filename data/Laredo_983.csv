"While there isn’t an over saturation of tea places here, there definitely isn’t much of an interest when looking at previous failed tea spots. While the cats may lure the customers in, it seems like most places here are popular for the first few months then die out. 

Take Laredo and Indian food for example. Delicious butter chicken, curry, and naan bread sounds fucking amazing but yet, Laredo doesn’t have one good Indian cuisine restaurant. Why? Because Laredoans simply aren’t interested in that type of food. There have been many Indian restaurants that have popped up over the years that “die” pretty quickly. Anise Kitchen was another prime example of an amazing business that just didn’t have the interest of people. 

I don’t want to discourage you but encourage you to be realistic and do sooooo much research. I had been to Austin’s Blue Cat Cafe many times before they closed and they were always empty. Granted, there was a lot of controversy surrounding that business, but I’d encourage you to look at other major cities and how their cat cafe’s manage to stay afloat. If you look closely, there are very very few cat cafe’s in the state of Texas that have lasted more than a few years. Currently there seems to only be 5-6 in the state of Texas open right now, majority in major cities. Look at these businesses first before making this life changing and money draining move.

There’s a saying I always tell people, “This is why Laredo can’t have nice things.” Laredo “food” culture is a very real thing that would take a whole academic research study on the effects of Mexican culture and food to explain why people are so set in their ways and tastebuds.",t2_j866o7fj,Chuntiis,0,1645375458.0,0,t1_hxpy87b,hxpy87b,False,potatotush,t3_svmher,https://www.reddit.com/r/laredo/comments/svmher/opening_a_cat_cafe_in_laredo_thoughts/,Opening a cat cafe in Laredo — thoughts?,/r/laredo/comments/svmher/opening_a_cat_cafe_in_laredo_thoughts/hxpy87b/,1,r/laredo,0,1

"I’ve heard of Laredo Cat Cafe, but I have some questions/concerns about it. I highly respect what they do, but I think I know the reason why they weren’t successful…
1. Were they a legit a cafe? I’m digging through their FB photos, and all I see are foster cats at a single home and occasional pop-up tables. No brick-and-mortar cafe. 
2. I don’t think they sold coffee. Or even human food for that matter lol. All I saw were homemade cat treats and goody baskets (they look nice though!)
3. They claim to be a non-profit, which imo is a big no-no for business. Almost all the *successful* cat cafes I’ve seen are for-profit. 

And yea, I’m aware of all the fees and costs involved. Not just food/animal regulations, but the health dept, zoning, insurance, landlords not wanting 20 cats on their property, etc. It’s a risk for sure, and that’s why I’m trying to make calculated risks.

"Came here to also mention Treahouse. Seems the owner was Doris Campuzano, maybe you can find her on LinkedIn.

Also several different sites mention that they generated $46k in annual revenue. Considering they also had 4 staff, that is far below enough money for a business to survive, not even enough to pay 4 people the minimum wage, which is probably why they closed.

"Laredo is safe. Though you will see the occasional shady person. (Like one time i was washing my car (next to gonzales autoparts) I'ven lived in Austin and Dallas and it's much dangerous over there. (also Tampa Florida and Miami) Like you know. If you hang out with the right crowd. Don't hand around afterhours in bars etc. You will be safe. Its just like any other city. I am currently in Laredo (i was born here). Yeah it is boring. (well right now they got a carnival and upcoming parade) There ain't much to do over here. Jobs are kinda well. You know. You can't make a living out of them. Minimum wage is still low. Unless you got some sort of trade or degree maybe there could be a good playing job for you. I'm probably leaving again this year.

"I'm late to reply but in the hopes you see this. Most of us have a voice in our head. It sounds like what our voice sounds. It reads books for us outloud, it voices our thoughts out loud, it helps us carry out a complete conversation (two voice tones) and it can i guess hum a song inside your head without anyone hearing any of this. Some people hear different voice tones, male or female voices along their own voice too. That could be a sign of mental trauma or a chemical imbalance. Some people go years without needing help but if this is distracting you, stopping you from carrying on your life or you are struggling it could be helpful to talk to your doctor or see if you can get a psychological evaluation. It's up to you if you want to try medication or counseling even s combination of such so that you can start feeling better by shutting off the constant sounds.

"Where did they get their information from? Because Laredo is pretty damn safe, (except for many traffic incidents.) There are a lot of problems on the Mexico side of the border, but almost all of that doesn't leech over.

""is it common to see crime happening every day?"" No, not at all. Both petty or major crime activity rarely ever happens, and if it does happen: its usually hyper-localized to like a single store or house, and its over within hours. People aren't doing drive-bys or shooting up neighborhoods. There's almost no petty gang activity, and you wont see groups of people causing trouble either. What you will see is people jogging, walking, and biking all day long without having to worry. Kids walking home from schools every day. Plenty of dog walkers. Just everyone living a modest quiet life here.

You could totally start a family here and not worry. It is very safe, (maybe a little too safe, where is that hint of danger that makes life exciting?); You might be a bit disappointed that there is no actual night life.

"I go across a few times a month. My passport expired like five years ago so I never bother to bring it with me.

When you’re walking to Mexico, you have to take the bridge that’s by the outlets. You can park your car at the Outlets parking lot and just walk towards the bridge. Have a one dollar bill handy as a person in a counter will exchange it for a coin used in a turnstile machine you have to cross through.

Once you’ve passed that, you’re free to cross the bridge. At the midway point over the river, you’ll see a neat metal plaque stating you’re right on the border. There isn’t any chain link fence in the few feet in between this point so it’s a cool photo op. 

Nearer to the Mexican side, you’ll see a guard with a gun, a metal detector, and an airport style luggage x-ray. If you’re not carrying anything big you can literally walk straight past all of this. Observe other people walking in front of you on the bridge; most of them walk pretty fast too, as if they have places to be and things to do. 

Once you’re in Mexico, the first few blocks consist of a few plazas, lots of pharmacies, and street vendors. It’s relatively safe; as a small, above-average looking female, I’ve never had any issues being approached or anything. Although, be aware there are always people who are “lookouts” who are always watching these plazas and the people crossing from America. Just try not to stand out too much and you’ll be fine; then again, I’ve seen super white, pervy old men walking confidently down the street with hookers like no big deal, so…. whatever.

Anyways after you’re done, just head back down that same bridge. You’ll see plenty of panhandlers; most have little kids with them. Take a little bit of change if you care enough to give them some money. At the halfway point, there will be two officers who will check your ID. Just have it ready and hold it up and they let you through without even really looking at it thoroughly. 

As for the passport thing:  You can come back just fine with your state ID. I’ve never once even been asked for my passport, but I’m sure one day they’ll ask for it. You can always say you left it at home or forgot it. Your state ID hold just as much power coming back to the US as your passport, as they scan your ID on their computer. They also ask you to take your mask down to take a picture of your face.

TLDR; don’t need a passport just an ID. You can walk into Mexico easily without being checked or stopped, however, coming back is when you need go through the checkpoint.",t2_j866o7fj,Chuntiis,0,1643675558.0,0,t1_hv2gout,hv2gout,True,CutAtBris,t3_sh81ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/laredo/comments/sh81ip/pedestrian_walking_across_the_border_to_mexico/,Pedestrian walking across the border to Mexico,/r/laredo/comments/sh81ip/pedestrian_walking_across_the_border_to_mexico/hv2gout/,8,r/laredo,0,8

I think you would have to be 18+ to work at Alamo Drafthouse since they serve alcohol. Cinemark at the mall has a lower age requirement of 16 years old, so there's an idea.

Another idea: How about a server or cashier at a restaurant? That was my little brother's first job, a server at Denny's, and he would always come home with a huge wad of cash and a pile of change every day from tips.

I lived in San Antonio (now in North Texas) and I went to these places maybe at the same rate that I did when I lived in Laredo. Ask anyone in SA or North Texas how often they go to these places and it'll likely be a similar response (quarterly or twice a year because mostly everyone just eats and drinks). Unless you and others go weekly or even monthly, it'll be tough to ensure survival of these establishments in a small to mid-sized City where people can barely afford eating out at casual dining places, much less taking their family to an entertainment venue.

"It depends what your idea of fun is. 


Laredo is a mainly Hispanic/family oriented culture, a tad on the conservative side when it comes to religion and morals, so getting together with loved ones (even friends) and having a good time is all some need.

If you're thinking music festivals, club night life, or just something specific from another city probably not your type of city. You make the most if it. I would say it's not the best city to move to for a single person who doesn't know anyone unless you have a really GOOD reason to.

They probably agree they are underpaid but most of them are humbled that they can make a decent living with only a high school education.

The firefighters have a very strong and aggressive union.  Year after year they keep draining the cities budget.  Starting pay is great considering alot of it gets taken away by their pension. Their pension is top notch.  Retirement with them is where it's at.  Year after year new firefighters that graduated looked like kids.  And alot of them go into it for the wrong reasons.  Money.

""The EPA’s threshold for an acceptable level of cancer risk is 1 in 10,000, meaning that of 10,000 people living in an area, there would likely be one additional case of cancer over a lifetime of exposure. But the agency has also said that ideally, Americans’ added level of cancer risk from air pollution should be far lower, 1 in a million. Our map highlights areas where the additional cancer risk is greater than 1 in 100,000 — 10 times lower than the EPA’s threshold, but still high enough to be of concern, experts say.""

The area near Midwest Sterilization Corp is 1 in 560, or 18 times the EPA's acceptable risk.
