"They’ve been trying to make this happen since at least 2015. The project was always to add a North-bound bike lane, they didn’t start looking into parking management until they finally started bringing this to the community (only because they’re legally obligated to) and dropped the news that it would remove 1/3 of the street parking (~120 spaces originally, I believe), and everyone pointed out that this would be a huge problem for the actual residents of the area. This is classic top-down development, where the initial idea is paramount and any and all research and community feedback is cherry-picked to support the initiative, and is ultimately expendable.

Most of the council is wildly out of touch with the actual working class, and that applies equally to people like Joan Shannon as well as Max Tracy (god help the nurse’s union).

"I would advise against Sephora - the one in the mall has really gone downhill. There's not a lot of product selection and it seems like it's hard to find staff. The folks at Ulta seem helpful and friendly for the most part, and the store is enormous.

What I think could be super helpful for you is investing more money into a session with a professional makeup artist. That doesn't have the option of buying products right there, but they would have training and experience in application and would be able to identify features you have that could help you tailor your YouTube searches. For example, I have oily eyelids, as well as hooded eyes, and I know I like a warmer color palette. So when I search for a tutorial for those factors, what I learn is way more helpful than something generic. Or they could help you figure out that you'd prefer a bb cream to a foundation, and that really narrows down your Ulta search. My hairdresser, who also did makeup for my wedding, is incredible, so I'll shout out her name - Sunnie Palker. But there are tons of makeup artists in the area!

Another idea is to ask a friend who does like makeup to let you play in their makeup bag. They probably won't be able to apply on you (it's such a different experience than self-application), but it again might help narrow down what you like and what products you want to buy. 

Most important of all, just play around! There's no right way to do makeup and experimentation is the best way to figure out your look. You'll buy some products you don't end up liking, and you'll get closer to the look you are going for.

And a total personal aside, but I think eyebrows are the most impactful makeup skill to have. If I only have time for one single thing on my face, it's 100% always eyebrows. The Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz is a beloved pen. I also like the KVD Beauty brow pomade.

I expect that the city should plow roads and sidewalks in a reasonable priority. Should bike lanes get plowed? Yeah. Should they be plowed first? Certainly not.

"I wasn't trying to say that the two cities get the same snowfall, which is why I cited the numbers. The two cities get *a lot* of snow. I'm not going to pursue looking into it, but I'm sure Burlington handles snow in a similar way to most other cities that receive snow in ample amounts.

I wasn't around either, but I'd say one of the smartest things Burlington ever did was pedestrianize Church Street. People can still drive there and enjoy a car free space. My point for bringing up Church Street is that removing car parking didn't hurt the business there and in fact makes it a destination.

"Did you look at the charts you sent? They receive half...half the precipitation Burlington receives during winter months. It's not even comparable. 

Business on Church St compared to when it was a street? Idk because I wasn't around during that time. I do know businesses are leaving it though.  I also know that Burlington and Church St. are not the same as a large city and as much a Burlington wants to implement these great ideas, they aren't practical in the real world. 

My biggest complaint about Burlington and probably will be forever because they don't fix it. Fix the waste water treatment plant. Want to actually do something good that will benefit the environment and all the people around? Fix the waste water treatment plant. How that isn't a priority over all these half-baked plans that look amazing on paper, but are illogical, idk.  

And I'll go out on a limb and say the generic retort people love to give, ""we can focus on more than one project at a time."" Burlington can't.

"Hey there, former Grand Rapidian here. I've lived in Burlington for 3 years now.
It's 1000% more liberal here, progressive, expensive and awesome. Also, no one here will ask you what church you go to, which is a plus in my book.
If you love the outdoors, there's plenty to do year round,and this part of the earth is really beautiful. But it is rustic compared to MI. Lots of gravel roads and even gravel parking lots right in town. The roads are crap compared to GR which is saying something, and we just don't care about snow removal like they do in MI, so make sure you have a good all weather type car. Nobody dresses up here. Dungarees and boots will get you into just about everywhere. 
Burlington is well educated and I find it's people very interesting and mostly sincere. Montreal rocks and is a breeze to get to from here.

I get that the city wants to reduce climate change but building a 200 foot long bike lane and removing 40 to 80 parking spaces doesn't help with that at all.

"Just wanted to mention that I've had the same problem -- every spring I seem to get at least one pebble BB embedded in my windshield -- but often, if you fix it quickly without waiting, a crack won't expand on your windshield.

Within a couple days of your windshield getting nicked (the sooner the better), I suggest just heading to an auto parts store and picking up a windshield repair kit. They're usually around $5 or $10 or so, which is way better than the $100 deductible most people pay for a new windshield. 

They're kind of cumbersome to use (and a little time-consuming, as you have to wait for several applications of the epoxy to dry), but ultimately simple enough. Anyone can do it.

"It’s been a couple years so grain of salt…I’ve flown out of YUL too many times to count. Not a terrible airport experience overall. It is worth it to fly international, as you can often go direct to many destinations in Europe, or layover in Vancouver for destinations in Asia. Possible this has changed, but they also have some great direct flights to US destinations that BTV simply does not offer such as MSP and LAX. I’ve also used YUL to get to places in the Northern parts of the US with a direct flight. Example: Flying Montreal to Winnipeg to get to a remote section of North Dakota. If you are going to fly out of YUL, leave plenty of time always, but especially when you are headed up on a weekday morning. You’ll have the border to contend with, but also traffic to get onto the island. The bridges and tunnels are bottlenecks during rush hour. It takes a bit longer to park, and if you are flying back into the US, you will go through Customs at the airport in Montreal. This takes a bit longer but you do not have to go back through customs at your destination in the US. All said, there needs to be a compelling argument to fly out of YUL vs. BTV such as a significant price or convenience difference, especially now with relaxed but still present pandemic related hurdles crossing the border. And parking does cost a bit more.

"This was taken from the bridge going up Main Street in Winooski; moments before the conductor deafened me with the horn. Left side of the roundabout for those who are not familiar with the local geography. I love the speculation about it's origins.

I was clearing the snow from my car on the hill when I heard the train coming. I sprinted to the tracks and captured this photo.

In my opinion the public process is probably one of the most important parts of this. There is no value in having the services if the entire neighborhood is against it. Like most of my neighbors are out buying pepper spray and security cameras and stuff. This site is less than like 50 feet from my front door and most people in my building are really pissed off at the city For doing this. The thing is we dont know if there will be on site staff or security or anything. The management plan hasn't even been written yet. Last night Brian Pine mentioned that there is also going to be a day gathering area within the site for people who don't live within the pod community. That was never communicated with the community before last night. There are significant security worries that come with building something like this in a residential neighborhood.,t2_9anez,Twombls,1,1647971832.0,0,t1_i1ou0ok,i1ou0ok,False,dropkickninja,t3_tk1e3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/tk1e3h/burlington_shortterm_rental_proposal_discarded/,Burlington short-term rental proposal discarded after City Council sustains mayor’s veto,/r/burlington/comments/tk1e3h/burlington_shortterm_rental_proposal_discarded/i1ou0ok/,3,r/burlington,0,3

"Honestly, if you're willing to postpone the move to VT for a year or two, moving to Boston first to get some work experience in-person and build a professional network will do wonders for you. The issue in Burlington is that you'll only find a few big players in town. I know GlobalFoundries usually has openings for Software Devs and Software Architects, but, in general, they tend to prefer hiring folks with experience for sales/tech roles from what I've seen. So it might be tough to get in as a junior dev. There are a *few* small tech companies in town, but frankly your best option is to work remotely. And it's not a bad option, lots of folks here work for companies out of Boston/Denver/SF and just work from home.

But you'll almost always have an easier time landing a remote gig if you have some work experience, which brings me back to Boston. Cut your teeth there for a year or two, get some projects on your resume, and then, while you live there, start applying for remote jobs. Land one, then pack up and move to VT. Burlington has gig internet connections so WFH is a dream here.

I somewhat disagree with this, actually. I think it's just a matter of knowing where to go. I'll admit that Plattsburgh doesn't have the most lively downtown *every* night but there are plenty of events going on year-round, particularly during the summer. There are also several breweries, restaurants, and other hang-out spots that could rival Burlington with ""things to do.""

"This meeting contains a few very controversial resolutions so its been going for a while. It also includes banning airbnbs and the winooski bike lane project which are both very heated debates.

 From public comments so far I can tell that most people agree that the city dropped the ball completely on handling this. Both people for and against the pod housing have said this. They did no outreach with the neighbors at all during the site selection and freaked out most people living in the neighborhood. Most people in the surrounding apartments found out about this because of news crews filming the area. And then we found out they plan on putting it in within a month without knowing what it even is going to look like. The city hasn't even secured the necessary services and security for the site.

Edit: so brian pine essentially said they did a ton of outreach to church street businesses. And landlords In the past few weeks. None to people who actually live in the neighborhood.. so thats nice.

More edit: he now says they are putting a daytime community resource center in the same location ti coexist too. That was not communicated at all with the neighborhood. This is turning into a massive cluster.

"Second this. Ridiculous the difference in housing costs in Plattsburgh. But. Plattsburgh is ugh. If you’re looking for the Burlington vibe you won’t have it across the lake. It’s a city coming back from the loss of the military base. It’s leaps and bounds from where it used to be and there are some good tech places to work - Burlington is about 45 minutes away. With a hybrid position (2 days a week in the office) it could make financial sense to commute across the ferry (25ish round trip but there are punchpass discounts). But. There’s basically one way to get from a to b and it’s one accident or snow squall from being a 7 hour commute in the winter.

"Entry level IT Is pretty plentiful. And for whatever reasons applicants are pretty low. I think a lot of that is cost of living and even availability of non crappy rental housing. Entry level Helpdesk here with potential to move into engineering within a few years is more than possible if you’re looking at the right orgs - keep in mind we have Champlain with a strong IS program, so there is some competition, but if you have any experience (worked at your schools Helpdesk, volunteered some it work, internship) you will really stand out to hiring managers. 

But PLEASE check out the housing situation. I’ve had two candidates back out after verbal acceptance because they were relocating and they just couldn’t find affordable housing (and I’m paying $30/hour). In the interview process I was pretty clear that housing was tough here, but I don’t think they realized just how tough. 

If you make it work and land something here, it’s a pretty cool town… People are generally friendly. They don’t really care much who or what you love. IT in Vermont is Suuuuuuper small. Everyone knows everyone or is one degree of separation. Once you’re here, count on hiring managers reaching out to your previous coworkers before even calling you for an interview. Most often this is advantageous, but integrity is super important in your career advancement in IT in Vermont.

That problem is compounded by a shortage of counter staff and a severe shortage of baggage handlers.

What you’re describing wouldn’t have worked before the pandemic and doesn’t work now because the airport is extremely busy especially in the early morning and staffing is critically low in comparison to three years ago.  The airlines need to raise ticket prices because they pay their counter staff an average of $15 an hour and at the rate that they get treated like filth and even threatened with violence it’s no wonder that they quit.  I knew a guy who worked the counter at United who did quit because he was only making $13 an hour and was sick of people being horrible to him when it was generally the passengers fault. They offered and $15 an hour to come back which he excepted but he then quit soon after.

If you don’t need resin but want 100% fill you can just set that in print settings.  I have an ender 3, can do.  Generator has at least 2 prusa mk2s, I built them.  So take your pick.

"The past few years we've gotten hundreds in the spring.  We also have a tiny front yard.  I'm not exaggerating.  Someone comes and does pick a bunch of them up.

I think my calling people out worked.  Our snow is yellow with pee.  It's actually pretty gross.

One time on Pease mountain a woman saw we were walking up and took the leash OFF her dog. I have no idea why, but of course it proceeded to lunge at us.

"Before I even finished reading the first sentence of your comment I thought “this person obviously owns an airb&b”, and sure enough…

This has to be one of the most common tropes used by people currently making money off of the housing crisis. Same lines, everywhere it’s happening. 

The actual fact is, most people don’t want to nor can they afford to just swallow property taxes and other upkeep costs for a house that is just sitting empty. If your wealthy enough that that is somehow a preferable option to just having a single home, you almost definitely weren’t airb&bing it in the first place. Why would you? People invest in airb&bs literally because they are a viable investment. Housing inventory is directly effected by said viability. If someone can’t make a ton of money off of house with far less commitment and liability than a long term rental, they are far less likely to snatch that house up above market rate. This repeated thousands of times does have an impact on the accessibility of housing in terms of both renting (because some people will still want to make the long term investment, but will want to cover it by renting, and more rental inventory is good for accessibility) and buying. 

It’s not just people moving to Burlington (or any of the other hundreds of places currently dealing with this exact crisis) now who get the shaft either. You could have grown up in a place and had the very simple desire to just live where you have always lived, but because real estate has gone from slow money to fast money over the course of the last few years, it’s suddenly much more difficult/impossible on a wage earned in said locales.",t2_2odtq7gj,Steevsie92,0,1647705467.0,0,t1_i1ak3wr,i1ak3wr,False,Nomad3014,t3_thki40,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/thki40/weinberger_vetoes_burlingtons_shortterm_rental/,Weinberger Vetoes Burlington's Short-Term Rental Regulations,/r/burlington/comments/thki40/weinberger_vetoes_burlingtons_shortterm_rental/i1ak3wr/,16,r/burlington,1,16

"Your point about flight is interesting, because if it was flat between Boston and Burlington and flights were running profitably you’d be right to explore a rail connection. But it isn’t and train infrastructure can be 10 or even 100x more expensive when you have to tunnel through the white mountains, and build viaducts over valleys, all to go faster than a moderately speeding car on the interstate",t2_5tbmn3hb,WinstonAtlas,0,1647672254.0,0,t1_i195zpc,i195zpc,False,sincerelymars,t3_tfriyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/tfriyu/rail_travelers_will_be_able_to_leave_burlington/,"Rail travelers will be able to leave Burlington for New York City and points beyond every day via Amtrak, starting in July",/r/burlington/comments/tfriyu/rail_travelers_will_be_able_to_leave_burlington/i195zpc/,1,r/burlington,0,1
"Hello! I’ll start off by noting that Amtrak hasn’t included this route in its 2035 plans which are moderately ambitious, just to give a gauge of how low down the priority list this is nationally. However…

Let’s consider the train’s competition with buses and air separately.

First train vs plane: plane is going to take 40 minutes from terminal to terminal, and maybe 1.5 hours from wherever in Boston to wherever in Burlington door to door. 

Rail can take a couple different travel times  depending on the level of investment, but a small 100 million dollar investment would take 1.5 longer than driving, because the train can’t take a direct route due to mountains, and it can only go 60 mph, so it’s much slower than driving or taking a bus. 

Megabus and grey hound have a hard time filling 2-3 buses per day on a trip that takes less time. If you don’t have enough people to fill a 40 person bus, you don’t have enough to fill a 400 person train.

There are lots of routes in the northeast where it makes sense to expand rail, even some in Vermont. But Boston to Burlington isn’t one, and we’d be better off spending the money on more frequent bus service.

Here’s a relevant analysis of the New England rail market, hope you enjoy.

"Hey long time no see! I’m sure you’ve looked at the data since you’re the guy who had me check it out when I made my post, but I think Burlington - Boston has a lot of potential outside of just shuttling college students (although I think the frequency of ridership by college students on weekends would increase to outside of 4 trips because a limiting factor of a college student going back is access to a transportation, right now it’s just Megabus/Greyhound). 

Just building the line itself allows the possibility of local/regional services along the route. If the focus is switched from just a long distance service to local/regional with an additional long distance service (say 2 trips a day to and from initially) I think it would prove to be a very popular especially if the building of the line results in economic development around the route and spreads out the job density along the corridor. 

I also think a service from Burlington-Boston is viable considering the interest there has been in flights from BTV to BOS. They’re already willing to travel without a car, so I personally would rather have them go by train then plane because environment. And they might like it as well as it could be more comfortable and can be more productive during the transit time compared to flying.

"So there are a number of species you can use because it seems like you're yard isn't extreme on either end. I'm going to mostly recommend perennial species because they're less labor-intensive on your end, and often better suited for pollinators.

A good idea is to plant species that will flower successively so there are always flowers for pollinators to be attracted to. Hopefully, I've provided a good spread of sun & moisture levels. Moisture isn't as big of a deal as sun level for plants - but if you want to ensure their happy growth you can alter the topsoil with sandier loam from Gardener's Supply or similar.

&#x200B;

Here are the main flowering plants that may be suited for your yard. 

* Wild Ginger (May-Early June)
   * Partial shade, medium moisture
   * Benefit of being an edible root that tastes like... ginger
* Spotted Bee Balm (May-June)
   * Likes sun and well-draining soils
* Foxglove Beardtongue (June-July)
   * Needs a lot of sun and moist soil
* Purple Milkweed (June-July)
   * Likes sun and medium moisture
* Joe Pye Weed (July-August)
   * Likes sun and somewhat moist soil
* Wild Bergamot (July-August)
   * Needs a lot of sun, medium moisture
   * Benefit of being an edible herb/tea 
* Anise Hyssop (July-Late August)
   * Needs a lot of sun and dry soil
* New England Aster (September-October)
   * High sun, mid moisture level

&#x200B;

Other Ideas:

* Seed your lawn with clover (white dutch for low height or english thyme for high) and let it take over.
* Plant blackberries or black raspberries in the shady fringe of your yard, after a few years (and some gentle pruning) you'll have loads of berries that birds and you will love, and flowers that pollinators love.
* Similar to above, some of the best pollinator plants are plants that also feed you, so a potted cherry tomato plant, or a pepper plant, or squash (high sun, high moisture) planted in a small garden are also great. Be careful of woodchucks or raccoons feasting on these though. Foxglove is a good deterrent, but so is chicken wire.
* Keep a kitchen herbs ready for your use - some may need to be potted & brought inside during the winter months.
   * Basil or other tender mint species, lemongrass, lavender, cilantro, parsley should be brought inside
   * Hearty mints like spearmint or lemon balm, chives can be planted in the ground

"Then they’re not really operating as a cab business, sounds more like a hybrid between a taxi and a hired car.  Generally taxis have to go off of metered fair and it is illegal to charge more, when I drove a cab I could work a deal or give a discount.  I rarely gave discounts because they only took money out of my pocket but sometimes it was worth it.  Say a passenger spent $100+ on a ride and needed a ride back, I might offer to not charge for wait time since I’m extremely unlikely to earn more in that amount of time and it’s always preferable to do one big job instead of 10 or 20 small jobs since that big job is almost certainly all freeway miles.

i’ve been very impish lately. honestly completely unintentionally too. at least with my original comments. i have sort of leaned into it in follow ups bc it’s embarrassing but it’s also a little cathartic to throw a tantrum. i think i’m still processing the after effects of these past two crazy years. i’m going to start processing it in a more productive way but i’m only human and i’m only doing it on the internet. i’m generally pleasant irl,t2_13gytv,TheDiceMan2,0,1647554440.0,0,t1_i12rara,i12rara,False,skinnyquads,t3_tg92rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/tg92rk/are_the_cement_trucks_gonna_come_down_church_st/,Are the cement trucks gonna come down church st today and if so when?,/r/burlington/comments/tg92rk/are_the_cement_trucks_gonna_come_down_church_st/i12rara/,1,r/burlington,0,1
"So I can’t speak for tippers in Vermont but I can say that business travelers were OK, nothing special and the wealthier a client is the less they tended to tip.  Something that always annoyed me was when people did expect a car at a specific time because they were never ready to go.  If you say be here at 4 AM and I’m here get in the car please or the meter starts.  

Some of the best jobs weren’t tipped, I did a ton of contract jobs for hospitals taking people home or taking homeless people to shelters.  Had a really fucked up job one time though. The hospital was discharging a homeless man to a shelter, poor guy had a broken neck and a halo drilled into his skull.  The shelter had closed for the night 90 minutes before we got there, it was only an hour job.  So I drove him back to the hospital and got in a screaming fight with a social worker who called security.  A doctor stepped in, dressed down the social worker, thanked me for doing the right thing and got the homeless guy a bed.  Still only got paid for one way but oh well.  

Another funny thing was prostitutes tended to tip decent, strippers not so much.  Obviously they never said they were working girls but you could assume and that’s OK.  More than a few times they handled me to wait until the client opened their door and there was always some variation of her saying pick me up in an hour and I’d loudly say sure thing, let the client know someone knew where she was.  I wouldn’t tolerate blatant illegal behavior but if I didn’t know 100% it wasn’t my concern.",t2_jl39e,Corey307,0,1647554390.0,0,t1_i12r6ae,i12r6ae,False,humongous_homunculus,t3_tgggxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/tgggxu/reliable_cab_service/,reliable cab service?,/r/burlington/comments/tgggxu/reliable_cab_service/i12r6ae/,2,r/burlington,0,2
