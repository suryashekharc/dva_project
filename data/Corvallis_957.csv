"It's not crass. We rented the whole place (including the rooms) Friday to Sunday (wedding on Saturday) for $2500. We had something like 100 or 120 guests...we would've had like 300+ but IIRC 120 was the then-limit of the septic system and after that we would've had to rent outhouses which are hard to find cute versions of. Prices might've changed since it's been awhile but given that it's already so beautiful and doesn't require decorations, table rentals or really much of anything, I have a hard time imagining anything else around here beating the price, relative glamour and ease unless it's renting a shelter at Avery Park or something. Our booking came with a free wedding day helper person along with some staff that were immensely useful the day of, especially since it was one of the hottest days of the year.

We got Bombs Away to cater it because I was tired of going to weddings and only getting one trip through. I also wanted vegan options for my vegan friends and that's real easy with their kind of food. Bombs basically rolled up a taco truck and it was like $7/head or something like that and they stayed until 9 or 10pm. I also had a Bono impersonator which fooled everyone and there are still people that think I had Bono at my wedding. He ended up marrying us because our officiate got cold feel and I told the impersonator to just get signed up with the Universal Life Church...and he's done a lot of weddings since then. We're still friends and I trolled the ever living shit out of Google twice when I worked there and some fancy malls in LA back when I visited him there (I was born/raised in Oregon and grew up in Corvallis, so save your Californian hate for someone else :)).

Also, make sure your friend makes time to actually eat during their reception otherwise they probably won't, especially if the party was as good as ours...I think I got half a taco and then after everything was over at 1am or something we went to Taco Bell to actually get our wedding dinner.",t2_3r2av,stuffitystuff,0,1648184428.0,0,t1_i212fdt,i212fdt,False,joannereyes,t3_tmm2ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/corvallis/comments/tmm2ee/wedding_venue_recommendations/,Wedding venue recommendations,/r/corvallis/comments/tmm2ee/wedding_venue_recommendations/i212fdt/,1,r/corvallis,0,1

"I anticipate the city board members will be planning more ""city beautification projects"". Years ago that was their plan when I was a board volunteer. And trying to get the money to go elsewhere took a filibuster but ultimately went to the pretty projects. They are real big on keeping the top tier bicycle community awards. I'm not against that but let's fill in the biggest gaps first and then do the fun stuff.
But you certainly hit the nail on the head. Why aren't more people at the city meetings asking/demanding to know what the plan is with the savings?

They use to project 10 to12 years (I think) to start seeing a return on the money lost which is not a bad time line honestly. I mean for a cost that high, that's pretty good money management plan. I just expect the same junk to carry on. We need a new county/city jail facility. For health reasons alone we should not be housing anyone at the courthouse. Its just so old and worn out. But does the bed count seem right? Seems excessive with our and other surrounding county current needs.

That is the question everyone should ask when going to a meeting on this, where is the money that is projected to be saved going to go to?

"I moved my family, including children,  from the southeast US to Corvallis five years ago and we are slowly but surely becoming acclimated to the area. The positives are the fabulous library (almost any title I have ever searched, they have), the majestic theater (great summer camps for kids), easy commute within the city and the proximity to so, so many outdoor adventures. I do feel that it is a safe little city to raise a family.

The negatives are the restaurant food which is  bland and not much variety. The standard fare here is 10 different styles of burgers listed on almost every menu. Also, there are not many options for shopping for clothes unless you go to TJ Maxx, thrift stores or a few boutique stores downtown. 

I don't know where you currently live, but I have found the regional differences to be the most difficult for me. The 6-7 months of cloudy, drizzly weather was really, really difficult for me to the point where I considered moving back to the southeast. I did find some relief with high doses of vitamin D during the winter and over time I have become more acclimated (and accepting) of the weather. Winters here will never be my favorite though. In general, most people in this region are polite, but not necessarily ""friendly"" so that has made it difficult to make friends. The pandemic sure didn't help, but compared to where I moved from, the differences are noticeable. I miss the small talk while waiting in line, or neighborly invitations.

"Late to this, but I wanted to add that you can pretty much just stick to Apartments.com, Zillow, and Craigslist (and the actual property/property management website) for your rental search. Almost everything else is a subsidiary of apartments.com and doesn't get updated as quickly because apartments.com doesn't get updated very quickly. Apartments.com pulls directly from the property management software but doesn't always match the property's current availability because there is a lag time, so it's best to just check the property website if you find something you like on apartments.com. Property managers have to manually post on Craigslist so it is usually accurate, but because it's not automated a lot of people either don't delete posts at all or just forget to when the unit is gone, so I would be skeptical of any posts older than a week, just sort by newest and you'll be good.",t2_43s5bi9a,soup_queen,0,1648061020.0,0,t1_i1tw1aa,i1tw1aa,True,Pete0012,t3_ti3rdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/corvallis/comments/ti3rdu/where_do_you_guys_go_to_look_for_apartments_who/,Where do you guys go to look for apartments?

"I was able to find an amazing standalone 2bd/1bath cottage style house in an area near the Benton Center for $1015 by using Craigslist. Initially I had contacted the property owner about a different listing but after talking he mentioned another property that would be coming available. This house was in a quieter area farther from the OSU campus which was more like what I was looking for. I was able to sign a lease before he listed the property as available and my new landlord told me that when it does get listed it usually gets 50+ inquiries within the first day. I’m definitely lucky with my situation but I’ve seen similar cottages listed at similar prices on Craigslist recently. 

I would absolutely recommend checking Craigslist religiously (good properties go FAST), looking at property managment pages directly (OSU has a directory), and contacting rental companies about properties that may come available during your move in timeline.

"First off - have been to the office and emailed management. Their response was to post a flyer, which feels inadequate. Because I've had frustrating experiences with property management not addressing issues like this in the past, I've been researching options that would afford tenants legal protection in cases like this. But I'm not finding much, so I threw this out there as a last ditch effort in case someone on Reddit had info/experience to share. I didn't just wake up one day and decide to whine to Reddit about my stupid smoker neighbor. 

Another thing, I'm a young woman and currently physically disabled due to recovering from a major surgery thanks to chronic illness (I mentioned that in the original post), so I don't just confront (or randomly text??) neighbors, especially as the person downstairs is clearly a dude based on signs I've seen. Who knows if it would be safe? After all, it's the property management's job, not mine.

Lastly, if you've ever heard of this thing called a full time job, it's a great way to pay rent. You show up for eight hours every day and then they send you a check.

But be prepared to water the plants, because as an ex smoker I know smokers don't usually care about the well being of others (or themselves).

"@PresentQuit6878. I feel for you, I really do. The spirit of your message is really frustration with unaffordable housing here in Corvallis. On that point, l totally empathize with you; homes (and so much more during this inflation ridden economy) are grossly overpriced and everybody knows it. 

Now having said that, prices aren’t at these levels because of the boomers. Should there be more affordable housing in Corvallis? Absolutely. Should the city of Corvallis subsidize housing for low-income families? Absolutely. Should Corvallis increase residential property development? Yes!!  Should people like you be given a chance to build equity vs enduring unbelievably high rent? Absolutely. 

The market demands these prices. Demand is far higher than the supply right now so in these situations it sucks to be on the buying end. Trust me, I know, and I’m not a boomer. 

My recommendations to you: 
1) save every damn penny you have. Eat cheap. Live cheaply. Sacrifice everything for as long as you have to in order to reach your down payment goal for a home. If you’re not already doing this, get roommates to reduce your cost of living. If you think you can save enough to put a down payment on a home (any home at this point) do it! 
2) If you’re not able to save $ for whatever reason, consider moving! Although housing is expensive almost everywhere, there are far less desirable places to live and rent/housing costs are commensurate. The problem with this though is PAY is likely to be lower in these towns as well (very small towns).

Okay. You could use a little more introspection though. 

You're ageist, so fix that. The mention of boomers in this thread title was for no reason whatsoever other than to satisfy your bias. If you had written ""serious question to Corvallis Jews"" or ""serious question to Corvallis blacks"" would you see a problem with that?

You don't possess basic reasoning. Instead of examining the contents of an argument, everything is about who you are or who the other person is. To you, homeowners are all evil boomers, and you think you're an expert on economics because you lived in California, and you think you're an expert on real estate because your mom flips houses.

"We liked it ok at first. I do think the pandemic actually affected it a lot. We found places that we liked to hang out at where the bartenders knew us. But the pandemic really affected all that. There seemed to be a lot of new, fun things opening, but covid kind of put a halt to it. 

Biggest thing for us was we didn't have many friends in Salem, while we have a lot in Corvallis. That was obviously a personal thing.

Some pros for Salem:

More affordable housing- we were able to purchase a house there when we couldn't in Corvallis

Has all the stores you need- Corvallis has limited shopping options. Grocery stores are good, but we often end up driving to Albany or Eugene for things like clothes and various other household items. 

Closer to other places- It's closer to Portland and takes the same amount of time to get to Eugene. We have family and friends in Portland, so that was nice. There's also Amtrak there.

Willamette University is in Salem, but it doesn't feel like a college town at all. They all hide away on campus, you never see them. Corvallis is definitely a college town. Huge influx of people in the fall, big frats and sororities, more likely to have loud undergrad neighbors. Depends what part of town you are in, though.

Some BIG cons:

Salem is more conservative, and since it is the capital there are a lot of protests. Trump era brought Proud Boys harassing people in parks and walking around with assault rifles. The police do nothing about it, but bring the riot squad when there is a peaceful protest. And there is no media coverage on any of it. The local paper is terrible. There is more overt racism. One of the only black-owned businesses in town is harassed and vandalized. A middle-eastern market went out of business downtown and someone wrote ""Good Riddance"" on the windows.

A lot more crime. Police open fired on a camper during a chase in our neighborhood. (My husband was on the news!) Someone got shot in the park down the road from our house. Police were patrolling around, trying to find someone hiding in our neighborhood once. 

Other things that aren't so great:

There are less good places to eat in Salem than in Corvallis, even though Salem is 3 times bigger. Corvallis's downtown is way more fun. Salem's has gotten way better over the years, though.

There is way more accessible nature nearby in Corvallis. You have to drive pretty far out of Salem to get to even just a small hike. Corvallis has more parks.

The public transit in Salem is terrible, and biking is kind of terrifying. Corvallis bus system is free and there are way more bike paths.

I'm not sure about schools. I think the schools in Salem are really unbalanced. The schools in West and South Salem are supposed to be good (west salem is supposed to be one of the best in the state) but the schools in other parts of town, with higher minority populations, get totally screwed. I think people like the schools in Corvallis? 

Corvallis has more of a community feel. There are also more events. Corvallis is definitely lacking in music venues, but Salem is just as bad. Corvallis has more quirky and unusual events, and because of the university there are all sorts of things that happen there (hopefully more as covid calms down)

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, moving to Salem was right for us at the time. Until the protests got crazy, we called it ""a fine place to live"". My husband could walk to work. We bought a house, which worked out well financially since we sold it when the market was crazy, so we were able to afford a place in Corvallis because of equity. But he's back at OSU now and I'm working from home and we were ready to go.

Gas prices are a little scary right now, so a 45 min. drive might be not so good. You can potentially find carpools though. My husband found one that went from Salem to Corvallis before we moved back. It's pretty common for people to commute from one to the other because of all the state work in Salem, and all the University work in Corvallis.

If you do end up in Salem, here is my big tip that no one listens to for some reason and then they regret it: If your husband's office is east of the river, DO NOT live in West Salem. The traffic over the bridge is terrible at rush hour.

Laughable. You need to familiarize yourself with what urban sprawl actually is. You're completely backwards here.

From a national view, I sat next to a guy on a flight in 2018 who worked for Zillow home buying services. He was launching their 11th market in PDX, and his job was to line up contractors to come in and repair houses that Zillow bought before renting them out.

Previously he worked for a real estate investment company doing the same thing. Hired when the company opened in '08 just after the housing crash, by the time he left in 2014 he was managing 30k+ properties on the west coast. These are homes, mostly starter homes, that will never re-enter the market unless these companies sell. They don't turnover on a regular 15-50year cycle.

Why don't you show us your refutation?

""If you eliminate single family residences, you eliminate single family residents who shop and work downtown""

No one talks about eliminating single-family homes. Just to make people to take responsibility for their own lifestyle and choices, isn't that an American concept, personal responsibility? If suburban dwellers had to pay the true cost of their pipes, asphalt, school buses, and so on, that lifestyle would become less attractive, and mixed-zoning buildings would gain traction.

""I moved to Corvallis to raise a family and that meant good schools and a big lot.""

Without citations, I can argue the opposite, kids raised in urban and walkable environments develop greater independence and can play with other kids in public spaces like parks instead of boring themselves to death in their own gigantic yard waiting for their parents to drive them to soccer practice.

"Not sure why people are claiming this town is racist. The town is mega liberal even without accounting for the university. If Corvallis seems racist to you, anywhere else in the US would probably make you overwhelmingly uncomfortable. Agree with the make your own fun perspective. Lots of nature and hole-in-the-wall shops and restaurants that are worth a visit.

Between college students and the elderly, people suck at driving here. People either drive like absolute maniacs or 5 under in a town with already low speed limits. It gets better around 8pm when it’s just the younger people out and about. There is a large traffic rush on weekdays starting at 4PM across the Van Buren bridge leaving town. Bicyclists often don’t follow the rules of the road and don’t have adequate lighting, but some are decent. There are less of them during the rainy months of the year. 

The town is clogged on Saturday game days. I wouldn’t recommend going out during this time with so many drunk people and out-of-town drivers. 

It’s a pretty slow town. Don’t live near campus if you’re looking to avoid the college parties. The public schools are decently rated.

"Corvallis with a family:

1. It's safe but vandalism and petty crime are rising.

2. Lots of sporting, musical,  artistic opportunities for children. You will see the same families in soccer, baseball, violin which means you kids will always know people.

3. Culture and cost of living completely depend on where you are coming from. Our restaurants suck compared to SF and our housing is cheap. Our restaurants are great compared to Hicksville and our prices are outrageous  

**4**. ** Education. The schools have a great reputation but they are changing. Whether that is good or bad depends on your perspective. The ""equity"" slate swept the last school board election and the schools are becoming much more progressive or woke or whatever word you like. For example, at the beginning on the pandemic, there were emergency meetings to rename Jefferson School instead of focusing on the real emergency. 

As an old-fashioned liberal with smart kids, I hated the changes. My kids still got a pretty good education but every change seemed to devalue excellence.

I wish there were more corners in the city like 29th and Grant (Co-op/Sam's station).  The scale of those shops fit into the neighborhood.

"Living in Corvallis you have to be okay with it being a college town. It's just a fact of life that the college influences pretty much every facet of the town whether directly or indirectly. It's futile to fight it.

The public schools are good, and you can't really go wrong with any of the elementary schools. Garfield and Lincoln are ESL schools though, so if your kids are, like, halfway through elementary school and don't know Spanish it might be a hard transition but they are cool if your kids are starting there in kindergarten and stay through 5th grade because they will learn some Spanish. You can basically pick any neighborhood and not worry too much about which school it's assigned to.

I hike for fun because I'm a PNW stereotype, and honestly hiking is not a unique feature to Corvallis, it's literally available across the whole west coast. I would say if you shop for fun unless that shopping is for groceries you might not love Corvallis.

It's small enough here to not really have a traffic problem most of the time, game days aside, but big enough that you don't have the locals up in your business the moment you move into town. In Corvallis, you can kind of coast under the radar for years before people might start to catch on that you aren't a temporary inhabitant. So for someone who just wants to keep to themselves, it's awesome.

"Well, thank you for acknowledging and for asking. I do have a very visible birth defect but besides that I'm well over 6ft and just a big guy. I was the typical ""so where ya gonna play football"" build for a lot of years. Don't get me wrong that was my jam but more for just a build idea in this conversation.

And not just once, but I have tried 8 times. Yeah I kept count because I wanted so badly to find a small store that I wouldn't be overwhelmed in and where I felt like I wouldn't have some drunk college guy at Fred Meyers trying to prove what a Billy badass he is to his buddies by going out of his way to shoulder check me. I refuse to go into Fred's and have for a lot of years unless I'm ready for a fight. It was so bad I actually got to hear the (yes little) guy tell his buddies what he was gonna do, do it, and then laugh because I chose the high road and not to meet him at his level. I have been told by a local judge for a clear cut self defense case that I could of been charged with attempted murder because of my size difference had this person's friends and the drug results told a different story so I am very hesitant to ever try to protect myself. 
Even in market of choice the women who see my defect will start making snide remarks about me to each other like I'm not there. It hits me hard and a big reason why I don't want to be around anyone in this town because it's been everywhere I turn. Even rounding into my 40's it's still a problem.

"I wouldn't endorse living in Salem, but I think that the best part of living in Corvallis is how easy it is to live here. Because the town is pretty compact and there's good infrastructure, I don't have to drive anywhere, so I don't care about traffic, parking, gas prices, or delays getting car repairs. If you're not commuting to Salem five days a week, I think you still reap a lot of those benefits, but if you are, I think you miss out on some of the benefit of living in Corvallis.

Similarly, I would advise that you not live way up on a hill in Corvallis. In addition to making it more difficult to get around not using a car, there seems to be some sort of airborne chemical up there that makes everyone who buys a house in the NW hills argue un-ironically that we can't possibly build any more houses in the NW hills within just a couple of years of moving in.",t2_eaxg9,Euain_son_of_,0,1646887817.0,0,t1_i02j5fi,i02j5fi,False,cadaverousbones,t3_tac7de,https://www.reddit.com/r/corvallis/comments/tac7de/do_you_like_living_in_corvallis/,Do you like living in Corvallis?,/r/corvallis/comments/tac7de/do_you_like_living_in_corvallis/i02j5fi/,5,r/corvallis,0,5

"Something fantastic about Corvallis is how many available parks and trails there are. I’m finding new ones every week and it’s wonderful! I’m in my early  20s so I can’t speak on what having a family here would be like, but the schools seem nice enough and neighborhoods surrounding them are fairly nice. On walks I typically always see families enjoying their time outside, rain or shine. 

Also, I currently work at a care facility and a few residents have lived in Corvallis their whole lives. They absolutely love it. I hear all about how the community center has great programs, there are so many volunteer opportunities, and the small town feel is pretty cool (especially if you appreciate running into people at the grocery store every so often).

"It's a long list and hopefully others will chime in. Watched Kip the owner pull copper plumbing out of his properties (active rentals) and replace it all with pvc. Not anything approved for household plumbing. Laundry list of ripping off tenants. Also watched him do his own electrical (never to code) and most recently there was a house of theirs that burned down on 9th street here. But don't worry last I knew he and his family were living in South America somewhere. Layered their roofing materials and ignored needed repairs, but that also applied to interior repairs, his wife Michelle would have sex with the male college students often allowing the guys to get some rent knocked off. Any time I had to go work on one of their former properties the city inspector would always shut the place down due to neglected problems. They had their ""handyman"" who was just an unskilled friend do all repair work which basically just meant charging the tenants. One job I had working next door to a rental of theirs I watched kip and crew pull out a bunch of copper wire, and just daisy chain the remaining electrical to keep if ""functioning"". Bear in mind this was two doors down from where his wife was celebrating her extra marital activities with a male tenant. Anyone that has ever rented one of their properties that I am aware of has never had a good thing to say. The management that is their company as well would ignore any and all tenant complaints and repair requests until lawyers were involved. Knew of some deposits that were said to have never been received. Even with banking evidence proving the contrary the cost of taking them to court was often higher so people would rarely pursue. 
Today these people are off their rocker is an extreme understatement. Michelle was also known to some in town as the reliable drug dealer and we suspect she is who fed her own child's addiction. 
On a personal note this family would often go to Hawaii to a nudist resort ( which would be fine except) and send out their annual holiday card with kip laying belly down on the sand, Michelle belly down on top of him and then the son and daughter stacked belly down on top of her. Like a little pervy child endangerment stack of pancakes. Also Michelle was well know. For sunbathing nude in the front yard. Just a very sick family. And they got away with this because they went to high school here and were a part of a large group of friends who became cops, lawyers, judges, city officials.... the list carried on. No authority would really go after them because of their connections. I learned how deep their ties went when I put kip on the ground for grabbing my friends ass when she was trying to avoid him altogether. This was middle of the day on a busier street/sidewalk not far off campus. 
It's a small town inside a small city and people that have been here long enough undoubtedly have their run ins with them. 
At least with Michelle I always heard the sex was consensual but kip was and probably still is a handsy P.O.S.

I would love to hear others chime in about their experiences. It's always fascinating

"I have been here four years, and it's fine. We live just north of town on Vineyard Mountain, which is very isolated and been good for a couple years of lockdown.

Pre-lockdown, very similar experience to what other people have said - mediocre restaurants, decent kid activities (parks and rec classes and swimming pool). I never found a group that led to any socializing, so I know basically no one in town. I work from home, which probably doesn't help with that. Generally found people significantly less friendly than in Portland where we lived previously. It also seemed like whatever groups there were in town (meetups and the like) all died off just before we moved here.

"I agree with a lot of what was said above. To speak on the Salem piece: I've also lived in Salem, and now live in Corvallis. I commute to Salem once a week for my second job. By far, Corvallis is the better place to live, IMHO.
Firstly, Salem is a dying city. When you go there, it feels like it's crumbling and dying before your eyes. Nothing new is happening, buildings are literally falling apart because no one owns them or cares about them. On the other hand, Corvallis feels to me like a very lively small town with growth still happening, even during the pandemic. 
Secondly, Salem does not feel nearly as safe as Corvallis (I speak as a white female in my mid-20's). Walking downtown Salem feels marginally safe, as long as you stick to THE main street. Wander off even just a block and it gets very sketch very fast. The homeless population is so, so huge everywhere in Salem. Crime is a problem. There are very few places I'd feel comfortable going with kids, or by myself, and even then you kind of have to know where not to go or wander within those areas to avoid stepping into sketchy areas. This is directly opposed to Corvallis, where I would easily go 99% of places alone or with children without worrying about my safety or theirs, or which streets I shouldn't cross. 
I have a lot of thoughts on the manner, but I'll give just one more: I've lived in Medford/Central Point, Monmouth, Salem, and Corvallis. Corvallis is by far my favorite, feels the safest, and is the perfect size and close to everything I need.

"I think it's just a different KIND of racism, and a kind that is in some ways more difficult to deal with. It's much more systemic and subtle, which makes it more ingrained. And, because no one is necessarily throwing around the n-word, it makes it much easier for well-meaning white people to insist that they are not racist.

Profiling occurs in police work, the high school performed West Side Story with an almost entirely white cast, organizational leadership is extremely white, the whole state of Oregon was founded on a white supremacist foundation - it's that kind of racism. Which isn't any easier to deal with if you're not white. In fact, it could be LESS easy because of  constantly having to fight against the insistence that Corvallis is not racist.",t2_7xi96,Nousagi,1,1646866817.0,0,t1_i01a0cd,i01a0cd,False,cadaverousbones,t3_tac7de,https://www.reddit.com/r/corvallis/comments/tac7de/do_you_like_living_in_corvallis/,Do you like living in Corvallis?,/r/corvallis/comments/tac7de/do_you_like_living_in_corvallis/i01a0cd/,1,r/corvallis,0,1

"There have been a lot of comments, so I'll try to keep mine brief:

I moved to Corvallis from Portland for school when I was 28. We left 3 years later when my partner got a job with the state so we moved to Salem. I was ready to leave Corvallis at the time- it's a little small for me.

Now, after 5 years in Salem, we are back in Corvallis. Anyone who doesn't like Corvallis should be forced to live in Salem for 5 years. It will really change your perspective. We now plan on staying in Corvallis for good.

The food is not as bad as some people say. While we were gone some really great new options opened up. You have to give Corvallis the small town pass- you can't compare it to a big city. Any small town is going to have less options for food and other businesses. For the size, there are some nice gems out there. 

A big thing in Corvallis is finding your people. I didn't enjoy it here until I had a good group of friends. We meet the coolest people here, but part of it is because my husband was in grad school in the horticulture department. So most of our friends are natural sciences people, hort, botany, geologists, so they are all just awesome by nature, in my biased opinion.

It's easy to bike here. You can float the river in summer. Lots of nearby hiking. Amazing farmer's market. We definitely get small town vibes here: run into people we know all the time, and our neighborhood is a super friendly community. One of our neighbors invited the whole neighborhood on Nextdoor to come enjoy the fire dancers she hired for her birthday.

"I came from a city in the northeast and I enjoy it here. It’s a much slower pace of life than I’m used to, which can be very nice. It’s a good town, nice parks and nice downtown. I especially love the Corvallis Benton library. The food is definitely mediocre overall, at least from what I’ve tried, but that may just be my bias showing. 

Politically, it seems rather diverse. There are lots of progressive leaning college students as well as white middle/upper class liberals. There are certainly conservatives and more rural people nearby as well, and some number of OSU students from more conservative parts of Oregon. I work at a shop where we consistently have to ask people to put on a mask (Oregon has had a mask mandate for a long time). Not super frequently, but at least once a day. I’ve noticed  political graffiti from across the spectrum. So the general vibe is hard to pin down.

"I grew up mostly in Corvallis and moved away many years ago, but return once or twice a year to visit my folks. I have a love / hate relationship with the town. 

I will say the Corvallis of 2022 seems 100x more livable than the Corvallis of 1990 (when my family moved there). I lived in Corvallis from 12-21 with a small gap in the middle where I lived in Washington. 

TBH. I hated living in Corvallis. Again, it’s way better now than the 90s but i really really hated living there. The town seems to have little interest in youth, would regularly shut down all ages music venues when ever they popped up, skateboarding is illegal just about everywhere minus the skate park, which is weird. The town had a massive homeless population as well. 

The schools are good enough. Seem from the outside looking in now, better than what I grew up with. 

The town is essentially crime free. 

The town is incredibly beautiful as the PNW tends to be. And the town is 100x more desirable than Albany, Lebanon, Salem, etc. 

Downtown Corvallis has grown by leaps and bounds and honestly the food is pretty great. 

Wonderful farmers market. 

Great coffee

Always has had a better music scene than one would expect in such a small town. 

I think now, as a middle aged college professor with kids, I would probably mostly enjoy living in Corvallis more or less . 

I despised it from 12-21 tho. 

Also, to be fair. I was kind of a bad kid. Got arrested a lot for graffiti. Dropped out of high school. Got in a lot of trouble for skateboarding. I probably deserved to be miserable.",t2_41k90,amprok,0,1646861631.0,0,t1_i00wram,i00wram,True,cadaverousbones,t3_tac7de,https://www.reddit.com/r/corvallis/comments/tac7de/do_you_like_living_in_corvallis/,Do you like living in Corvallis?,/r/corvallis/comments/tac7de/do_you_like_living_in_corvallis/i00wram/,13,r/corvallis,0,13

"I have friends in Boise and have visited and talked with them about the area. I think it has a lot of promise but a lot of uncertainty. The city is trying to be progressive, and the downtown is a great example (no car zones and mixed use zoning), but it is in Idaho, which is very libertarian. That political ideology values absolute freedom over improving outcomes for the citizens. It's a wild west approach to curating an equitable society. The lack of regulation results in instabilities in the market and wildly changing property values. Boise felt the 2008 housing crash hard. BUT, it's currently ballooning... will it stabilize or will it burst?  


As for the people, in Boise proper I think there is a nice blend of differing political views coexisting. Outside, less so. Yes, Oregon is like this, BUT in Boise you are a day's drive from another well populated location. In the Willamette valley there are more well populated places closer by.     


Boise is a ""big"" city compared to Corvallis, so it will have much better nightlife and access to shopping. BUT, it's a car-centric, big box, cookie cutter housing, type place. Corvallis has a more intimate feel. Unless you can afford to live right in downtown Boise, you won't feel much different than being in the suburbs of most major U.S. cities (outside of weather, access to recreation, and other things you might be looking for that differ among geographic locations).

"Most useful response on this thread imo.

My only objection, and it’s only partial, is that I’ve actually seen some good police interactions. My neighbor has mental health challenges and frequently gets visits from the PD. I’ve actually called them to thank them for being respectful and helpful, which says a lot because I’m VERY critical of police in general. Granted this is anecdotal. 

As for food, there is a fair amount of ok food and a lack of really good food. I guess it depends on your personal taste. I grew up in Baltimore MD and find the food scene here abysmal. 

Great trail access if you live in the Northern part of town, maybe south too, though I dunno because I don’t live there. Lots of bike lanes and half-decent public transit for a small town in USA. 

As for politics, lots of NIMBY liberal types who are generally pleasant to be around so long as you’re not going against the grain. As a fairly-closeted transwoman I feel pretty safe around town, though it varies just like anywhere else. 

College kids are everywhere, which I don’t mind personally but I guess if you don’t like that then maybe move elsewhere. That being said, housing is weirdly segregated due to high costs. So you have neighborhoods that are well-kempt, and those are mostly inhabited by aging boomers, whereas millennial yuppies buy the overpriced crappy old homes that the boomers eventually leave behind. So if you are a parent, it can be hard to feel like the neighborhood makes sense because it’ll be your family surrounded by a bunch of 3 br houses occupied by 1-2 seniors. It’s weird and I guess unique to the yuppie scum, of which I am a member lol.

Can’t think of anything else for now.

"I’m from California too (Costa Mesa) I think there’s good stuff here you just need to look. Most the things to do involve the outdoors like good biking and hiking, fishing pretty close by, and a wildlife refuge not too far for wildlife viewing. There is good food, again just have to look. The bazaar on the south side of town has some of the best hummus and Mediterranean I’ve had. Cheesy stuffed burgers is a great place if you’re into burgers (obviously) there’s local boys Hawaiian cafe, and flame mountain KBBQ which has a cracked Korean dipping sauce.

You've clearly never been to California so just stop. Corvallis sucks i can have that opinion without u trying to prove me wrong. U can literally tell its full of the rudest people just by going out and interacting with almost anyone at any given time or place. Look at how the cart Corrales look here compared to way busier places in cali. People here are so rude and inconsiderate they leave carts all over and the cart holder look crazy but in cali its an unspoken rule to push ur cart in nicely to leave it for the workers and not make it harder on them. Here that's all out the fucking window. 🙄 it's the truth go cry about it idc but i wish someone would have told me how it was here because it is true. I would say go visit cali and see for urself but they wouldn't take kindly to a racist inconsiderate corvallian so if u acted like that there you would have some consequences 🤣😂 people feel to safe here i guess is why they're okay with the open and blatant racism.

"I'll just say I have had the opposite experience with respect to how nice people are. I came from rural Oregon where racism and bigotry is much worse. It was refreshing to go to college and meet many different people who all seemingly got along. I decided to stay after I graduated. I know the demographics are not as diverse than other places, but that's Oregon, not Corvallis. The college, and Hewlett Packard subsidiaries, and the hospital, all make it more diverse than any other place in Oregon outside of PDX.  


To be critical, downtown has changed with an increased tension between the haves and have nots. This is true up and down the west coast. I've largely avoided these issues, partially due to Covid, but partially due to no longer going downtown for nightlife (too old) and not being wealthy enough to shop at boutique stores.   


Housing costs are high, but the college, and it's need for rental housing, shields the market from extreme dips. The housing crisis in 2008, that brought home values down across the country, only slowed the growth in Corvallis. It's a very safe investment, especially if you are close to the college (which doesn't have to mean in a party neighborhood... almost all of Corvallis is ""close"" to the college because it's a small town). Our home was ""ridiculously"" expensive for what it was when we bought it but it's returned far more than other investments would have because the housing market in Corvallis is so strong and stable. You will see this next to any major university.   


In the past 10 years it has been deemed the smartest town in the U.S. (twice) based on college degree ratios. It has also been ranked the ""safest"" town in the U.S., but that's a bit misleading because it's based on crime and insurance claims. Oregon has relatively little risk for catastrophic (earthquake cough cough) natural disasters, so it gets a misleading bump. Places like Kansas (tornadoes) and the south (hurricanes) will never be high on the ""safe"" list. Corvallis is safe for the most part crime-wise, but don't leave your bike unlocked or a laptop in your car.

"I grew up in Corvallis, went to OSU and moved away a few years ago. I come back a couple times per year to visit friends and family.

Corvallis is definitely not perfect, but it’s an absolutely fantastic place to raise a family for people who enjoy a slower pace of life. Very good schools, minimal crime and a nice small-town feel. Corvallis can be a hard place if you’re single and in your 30s, but it’s great for families.

Housing is definitely not cheap, but that’s a problem that isn’t unique to Corvallis. You can definitely live in Corvallis and commute to Salem. Not the greatest commute, but it’s not that bad, either.

I’d take most of the negative comments with a grain of salt. Corvallis is a very nice place to live if you’re OK with not being in a city. Corvallis has grown and gotten more expensive; show me a desirable place that hasn’t.

"Housing prices are high. Old, 3 bed, 1bath places that needs repairs are going for $400K.

The food scene depends on your background. If you have ever lived in a real city, you'll find the food rather sad here. If you like food lacking in things like taste and quality, it's awesome.

If you like the outdoors, it's a great place. The ocean is about an hour away, as are the mountains. Technically, Corvallis is a ""city"" but a 10-15 minute drive will put you in the middle of farm land.

The public schools are still very good. Recently, however, there was a coordinated effort to take over the school board by the trumpy right wing segment of the town. Luckily, they failed. Having said that, they got nearly 40% of the vote. Liberals here live in sort of a bubble, thinking they live in a very lefty town. That's true in some neighborhoods (think $$$$), but not all.

The town is crawling with cops (city, county, university, and state). That wouldn't be a bad thing were they ""good"" cops. Unfortunately, CPD employs many corrupt bullies (google Steve Teeter for example) who have been in the department for many years.

The university is the true power in town. What they want, they will always get. The needs, wants and desires of those who live in Corvallis will always be second to whatever OSU deems their needs. If you are a fan of the university, you might see that as a good thing.

"Hi there, to be completely fair I admit I have a very jaded view of this town. I have lived here for over 30 years. 
Pros: beautiful town, decent schools (room for lots of improvement), lots of smaller businesses, 30 to 45 minutes from a wide variety of outdoor activities and a ton of activities to be found locally. Close enough to large cities that you don't have to plan your entire day around going there. Only an hour from the coast. 

My list of cons: 
The people, yes there are some amazing people here but can be very difficult to find decent folks. Social circles are a big deal. If you are ""different"" or look a certain way you can expect a lot of backhanded compliments at best and a ton of whisper shit talking behind your back. The small business owners treat others like they should be respected in the highest regards while they step on you. The local P.D. has a strong practice of shooting first when someone is having a mental breakdown. Also the P.D. profiles big time. Working in customer service is worse here than anywhere else I've experienced. Local authority feud between the city and college so nothing is ever done. 
Basically if you like being around older white men and are comfortable when they talk down to others for no reason then you may get along here just fine. And no night life unless you just want to hang out around drunk students.

I'm not making any assumptions about who you may be, just offering my experience. Rent is very high here. It's high in Oregon period but worse here. Also the price of homes has climbed out of control. The more ""connected"" someone is, the worse their behavior is allowed to be. Yes yes isn't that how they all are? Well sure it's just here they think being on a volunteer city board they should be entitled to royal treatment. Our city officials tend to take the positions to climb their own private social circles and not to represent the people. Its a lot of big impressive talk here without the representation of any skills they claim to have from the expensive training we pay for. And taxes are a mess. If you are moving here for school, check out albany its a little cheaper. If you are looking to relocate, well, buyer beware.

"Housing costs are pretty high. Best activities are outdoor oriented. Great nature areas, hiking, kayaking ect. Ocean is nearby, mountains are nearby, and if you want big cities are nearby. Portland is a little over an hour away, Seattle is closer to 4 hours, and even San Fran is with in a day's travel.  So it's very well located for day trips/long weekends.  As for an area to raise kids, the schools are good here. There are great parks in the city. Biggest issue is older teens complaining about ""nothing"" to do because no mall ect. But with how things are today not even sure they care about that.  Politics in Corvallis are pretty heavy liberal/democratic. It's a lot of older retired educated folks. Surrounding areas (Albany, Philomath, Lebanon ect) are much more red state minded.   Overall my take on Corvallis is that it is very nice and quiet and if you like that then it's great. But if you are someone who needs a ""big scene"" then it's not right for you.  It's a nice place to rest with access to all the perks of big cities if you are willing to drive a bit. Also as a note there are free city busses here and they cover the whole city. They don't run as often as bigger cities but it's a great bus system for our city's size.  I recommend if you are raising a family to not get a house too close to campus or near any of the huge tall multiplex housing that favors college students. They tend to be very loud and destructive. The older neighborhoods are safe for kids to ride bikes ect, few cars.

"For those who are interested, taking your landlord to court means small claims for things less than $10,000. Entry without proper notice has a penalty with a fixed dollar value that you can file for, heads up these chucklefucks are rumored to retaliate a lot which carries a WAY bigger penalty, but then you have proof and court filings, and you can also find free legal aid through Oregon Legal Aid and Fair Housing Counsel of Oregon. In OPs case if they carried out a visit more than 7 days after their request, without contacting them to schedule, its money time. Anytime your landlord comes in without notice or specified contact it's money time. State of Oregon has a really good guide on how small claims court works, and how to file. Benton County Circut Court let's you file claims online. $50-$100 to file. You can check for the specific statutes and fine amount by pulling up Oregon Revised Statute 90, ORS 90, USE THE .GOV PDF NOT  A ""LAW WEBSITE"" THAT UPDATES VERBAGE LESS OFTEN. Keyword search the PDF for things like ""maintenance, actual notice, entry, actual damages"". I'm only saying this because Kip and Michelle can drink bleach for all I care.

Trust me, lifting the mask mandate so that people don’t have to wear a mask for the 30 seconds it takes to get a table at the restaurant and so that they don’t have to pretend-wear a mask below their nose in the grocery store isn’t going to kill you. Fortunately, there are now many grocery delivery services available, in large part thanks to this pandemic.

Just curious, were you able to get the vaccine? My understanding is that there are very few adults who legitimately can’t get it.

>	The American College of Rheumatology COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Guidance recommends that people with autoimmune and inflammatory rheumatic disease get the vaccine unless they have an allergy to an ingredient in the vaccine.

Edit, I am late to the thread and saw your comment:

>	Mask mandates have been laughably enforced for months (years?) now = can you expand on how exactly lifting this ban will have any meaningful impact on a “return to normalcy”?

So if the mandates are being laughably enforced, how is it a threat to your livelihood if they’re being lifted?

She applied for physician-assisted suicide and was denied because she also had the diagnosis of clinical depression. I was surprised and angry at first, because DUH, she was dying and miserable so of course she was depressed. But I ended up feeling reassured that the state is exceedingly cautious on behalf of protecting patients.

"-My favorite restaurant in Corvaills is Baguette Vietnamese Sandwiches. I would recommend beef lemongrass and beef soup. 
-First burger in Albany is by far of the best burgers I had and they also have delicious sweet potato fries 
-I would also recommend going to The Barn at Hickory Station in Albany. They have around 10 food trucks. I have tried three of them and I enjoyed the food.

We would like to clear some things up, in regards to Zia Cuisine’s exit from Common Fields.

We do not feel it is professional to announce why we made the choice to part ways, and we hope you can trust we will do what it right for our family owned business and the community we have created here at Common Fields. We greatly value your feedback, and appreciate your passion for small businesses. We are excited for our next chapter and ready to share new and exciting locally owned businesses with you.

"Copied from their Facebook post:

>The Zia family wants to thank everyone in Corvallis for all your support over the years! Unfortunately, Common Fields informed us yesterday (Tuesday, March 2nd) that they have decided to ""rotate all of the current food trucks and replace them with new ones"" and have asked us to leave.
>
>Since this came as a complete surprise to us, we do not have any other back-up opportunities lined up and can no longer afford to stay in business. So, it is with an incredibly heavy heart that we have decided that it is time to shut down Zia--both the food truck and farmers market booth.  
>
>Zia started out as a way for a family of transplants from New Mexico to share their food and culture with Corvallis. We have always tried to stay true to the New Mexican cuisine and culture while maintaining high food quality.
>
>AND YOU ALL GOT IT! You not only understood but also appreciated what we were trying to bring to Corvallis. So once again, thank you all! You have all been amazing!
>
>We do not know when our last day is-as I said we only found out yesterday and are still in a state of sadness and shock and honestly panic since this has been our livelihood for close to 10 years. But when we figure things out, we will let you all know. If you want to make sure that you get some Zia grub before we are gone forever, stop by soon.

>We would like to thank Corvallis Farmers' Market  for giving us our first opportunity to share Zia with you all and @corvallisculinaryconnections  who have been huge supporters and were so helpful during the pandemic shut down.

"Al Jebal has good Middle Eastern food, nowhere else like it in town really that I know of. Burrito Heaven also has really good unique burritos. 

If you want real hiking/backpacking with alpine meadows and 6000'+ peaks you'll want to drive east into the Cascades. The Coast Range does have some really nice wilderness but a lot of clearcut and young forest too. 

The best bookstore in town just went out of business unfortunately, but they have another location staying open just down the road in Albany. 

Happy Trails records is still kicking, great music selection and super nice people. 

Woodstocks Pizza/Suds & Suds is a classic hangout spot with arcade and tons of beers (no liquor).

The weekend Farmers Market downtown is pretty good, and there is also a sort of underground farmers market ever Tuesday evening in Southtown I can tell you about if interested. 

The best restaurants around honestly are about 15-20 minutes down the road in Albany, but in Corvallis we like Kimhoa's, most of the family Mexican places, Tacos el Machin if you want authentic Mexican tacos, Evergreen, Al Jebal in Southtown, the Show & Szechuan Cafe both have amazing Chinese food, Upper Deck is a fun pub in an indoor sports park (we hang out even though we don't follow sports at all haha), American Dream pizza of course.

"Evergreen Indian is 🤷‍♂️. Check out Nirvana in Corvallis or Royal India Cuisine food cart in Albany (worth the short drive and definitely the best). Evergreen < Nirvana < Royal India.

4 Spirits Distillery has excellent food, spirits, and cocktails. It also has the best veggie burger in town. 2 Towns ciderhouse is good when you’re not feeling the beer but I don’t think they serve food. Block 15 is the main brewery in town and has a glut of IPAs 

Bo&Vine or Block 15 for burgers. When Caves Public House reopens, that will likely be the best burger spot in Corvallis again. 

Seafood is best at the coast but Pacifica market has freshly caught seafood for sale. 

Laughing planet or Cafe Yumm for plant-based meals although most Corvallis restaurants have some kind of veggie option but it can be hit or miss depending on the restaurant. 

If you’re in Philomath — Gathering Together Farm has good seasonal based lunch and dinners, El Corazon for Mexican, the Woodsman for Thai, Dizzy Hen for brekkie/brunch, and Sissie’s for baked goods. 

Honestly, the towns surrounding Corvallis (Philomath, Albany, and Eugene) all have much better restaurants and menus than Corvallis IMO. If you’re a foodie, Corvallis can feel very limited after a number of years of living here. 

For a college town, it is odd that there isn’t a good pizza place. I’ll offend lots of townies by saying this, but avoid American Dream pizza unless you like eating a chewy, cardboard crust. 

————
You will need to drive to Eugene or Portland for good live music and/or dancing (unless you want to dance with the OSU undergrads). There are some local shows in Corvallis but nothing too noteworthy and the venues don’t have the best sound systems. All of the “big name” bands do not play in Corvallis since there are no venues to support them. 

Most of Corvallis closes down early (8 or 9pm) so do not expect a booming nightlife with the exception of the local bars (Squirrels, Kingfish, Treebeards, etc.).

——-
Gamagora geekhouse for board games but they are temporarily closed. Pegasus games is another board game spot. The Brick Circuit in Albany also has a good board game selection but I don’t think they have any space for playing. 

——-
Try to avoid renting from Deurksen (slum lords) and The Schoonings (straight-up criminals). We used to rent from Windermere Property Management and thought they were decent people to rent from.

——

For hiking, go to Grassroots or the Book Bin and buy a copy of ‘Corvallis Trails’. It is a great resource for all of the local trails in Corvallis. For a short hike, go to the Lewisburg Saddle and hike the Old Growth trail. Otherwise, check out Peavy Arboretum if you want to hike in a forest setting. Or Chip Ross Park (great views of the Cascades on a clear day) with a better trail network than Bald Hill. Bald Hill is ok but the trails are poorly designed and there are tons of social trails that may be confusing if it’s your first time there. 

Wherever you decide to hike (coast or Corvallis) DO NOT leave anything of ANY value in sight at ANY trailhead or parking lot. There is an abundance of petty crime in Corvallis and there are regular smash-and-grab break-ins at the trailheads. Even in the middle of the day. So don’t leave any bags or other belongings visible in your car. And if your biking around town, lock that shit up too! Albeit, bikes still get stolen on the regular. 

——

And if you are in Corvallis on March 12, check out the Winter Farmers market for good food carts (especially the pupusas).",t2_a92vugzg,ManduLego,0,1646323336.0,0,t1_hz731yd,hz731yd,True,Fabulous-Maybe-6966,t3_t5so9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/corvallis/comments/t5so9l/best_things_to_do_places_to_go_food_to_eat_etc_in/,Best things to do / places to go / food to eat / etc in Corvallis??,/r/corvallis/comments/t5so9l/best_things_to_do_places_to_go_food_to_eat_etc_in/hz731yd/,18,r/corvallis,0,18

"I think the operative consideration here, from a public policy standpoint, is not really deaths or endemicity, or some other nebulous factor, it's hospital capacity. That is a variable that can be influenced, on margin, by marginally beneficial actions like masking. Albeit, masking while walking in and out of a restaurant does nothing if you stay and eat for an hour, but in other settings, even suppression of 2% of hospitalizations is meaningful when hospital beds are full or near full.

"I mean, I don't care about having to wear a mask at a grocery store. I would understand if the workers don't want to, though. In my office, I must either wear a mask or close the door. If you don't have an office, you just have to wear a mask all the time. It's an old building and the HVAC doesn't function properly with the office doors closed so it gets very hot. Since a well functioning HVAC that recycles air more quickly is more effective on its own than masks, this seems like a ridiculous policy decision. So I think we can do without that nonsense.

Same with restaurants. Why put on a mask for 30 seconds when entering and exiting? That does nothing at all, especially when we're over 70 percent vaccinated. I'll still do it, cause it's not that hard and I don't want to make some worker's life more difficult, but it's ridiculous.

"Yeah the way I've viewed it is that as long as hospital beds are at basically full capacity, there's good justification for taking actions that have a marginally beneficial impact. Before the option of vaccination, you'd prefer people to just not eat indoors, since that defeated most of the point of masking. After vaccination, with political will to close restaurants--or even ask people not to eat out--at a minimum, masking provided a very marginal benefit. But the margins were so thin with the regional hospital beds at 95+% occupancy, the marginal benefit was justifiable.

"I'm really late to this conversation but there is a difference between mask mandates not being efficacious and appropriately fit tested N95s being very efficacious. Those are not mutually exclusive statements. 

N95s are very good, like you've said and the studies you have linked. The issue is that that does not work for realistic use in the general public. The general public does not have access to fit testing. They don't have access to a new N95 each day. There is no guarantee that a lay person will wear their mask effectively even if it is a N95. Not sealing one correctly makes it worth nothing. etc etc. 

So no, there has been no strong efficacy studies on masking mandates being helpful. In all of the studies I have read, there are too many limitations to make it concrete evidence as opposed to other human behavior and decisions such as getting vaccinated, social distancing or being in small crowds in ventilated areas. Basically everything is observational qualitative research with many limitations. And its combined effort of all of these risk reduction strategies that is really lowering case loads.
