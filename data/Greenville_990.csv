"/u/Cirzxci is correct. Contextually we're still very affordable compared to bigger markets. We'll continue to see expansion of prices into submarkets like Easley and beyond (already seeing it in Greer) as buyers are having to purchase further and further away from the city.

Unfortunately I don't see prices dipping at all. DOM (days on market) may fluctuate a bit to give buyer's a little bit of a reprieve, but at the send of the day seller's will hold the cards and the pricing trend will be upward considering how desirable Greenville is nationally.

"Welcome to the party. Here‚Äôs the brochure: For runny nose especially and Watery eyes try Flonase or other nasal steroid it can help if you use it daily (maybe not use as much or at all in winter, it can cause nosebleeds when combined with cold dry air with the thinning nasal passage tissue that steroids cause.) The key is consistent use with those sprays though, it‚Äôs not instant. You can also try a daily antihistamine like Zyrtec or Claritin - those always made me feel kinda weird and i never felt like i got much results though but. If you‚Äôre having a pretty bad day where you can‚Äôt stop sneezing/coughing from drainage/etc then something like Benadryl will help despite it‚Äôs drowsiness side effect (gets you a good nap though). Allergy eye drops are great over the counter in my opinion if your eyes watering are your worse symptom but eye doctor has prescription ones too (maybe don‚Äôt use too close to bedtime since they can dry your eyes a little and maybe wake up feeling uncomfortable). If you‚Äôre literally so miserable and every orifice above the neck is dripping or spewing  liquids then I recommend going to urgent care or doctor  for a Kenalog (long acting steroid) shot, not cortisone that stuff is meh compared to kenalog in my opinion. This is really only worth it for helping absolute misery or multiple days of Benadryl and it‚Äôs affecting your life. You‚Äôll start feeling better in a few hours and by next morning it‚Äôs almost always resolved.

"The money they're paying on their mortgage is going away. It might drop some if the market dips, but they're still holding assets. They're essentially just converting their money into houses. Meanwhile, the money paid by renters doesn't do them any good. That money is gone. There are no acquired assets. So as long as the rent money paid to the rich outweighs the potential dip in house pricing, the rich come out on top. Rinse and repeat when you have enough money to buy another house.

It's the simplest way to make money, with one caveat: you have to start out wealthy. If you don't, you can't outbid anyone.

"you're right its crazy.

So quick story, I bought my home in Wellford for 245k in july of last year. My direct neighbor lists his home in December of last year for 260k.  Its slighlty smaller then mine. 1 less bath and bedroom.   
He gets an offer from a property management company for 265K that day.

They replaced some rugs, power washed the outside and now have listed it for rent for 2100.

So their mortgage might be under 1k and their charging double that for rent.

They are going to make bank with that home and will be able to buy more homes and so on.

Now your right about people affording the rent. Maybe a larger family? With 3 or 4 working adults? Maybe a wealthy couple building a home down here and need a place to stay?",t2_c7e0kcky,SCdreamin2021,0,1648077470.0,0,t1_i1v1w0u,i1v1w0u,False,SOILSYAY,t3_tl6cxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/tl6cxo/greenville_is_a_big_beefy_sellers_market/,"Greenville is a big, beefy sellers market",/r/greenville/comments/tl6cxo/greenville_is_a_big_beefy_sellers_market/i1v1w0u/,5,r/greenville,0,5

"Its all about context though, isn't it?

Price wise, its not the most expensive city in the southeast or east coast, but if you're a first time home buyer in Greenville and you already live here you face two challenges. 

One challenge is that the market is SO hot right now that you're unlikely to get the first house you put an offer on, so you wind up going with 2nd, 3rd, 4th...20th choices.   

Two challenge is that your dollar will go less far if you're from down here than for someone coming in from the northeast or west coast. Generalization, someone moving here from somewhere geographically that pays more will have greater buying power than someone who is a SC native.

"My girlfriend worked for a Greenville chiropractic 'holistic doctor', and some of the stories she told me blew me away.
The guy was diagnosing people with actual serious conditions using a useless machine that 'read their magnetic field', and then prescribing them homeopathic 'remedies' (water with some alcohol) or colloidal silver (tiny tiny droplets of silver particles).
The clientele was mostly made up of sad, desperate, or crazy people (in some combination).

Our medical (billing) system nationally isn't always great (in fact it's pretty terrible), but going to Quacks who at best won't cause harm at worst cause more harm and take your money.

"The irony of this post is someone is complaining about ""drivers don't know how to use the crosswalks"" but I see that red hand which means you aient supposed to be in the crosswalk anyway.  Theres some mutual respect here failing on both sides.   


Now if it was flashing and you were actually in the crosswalk I would give you some lee-way but considering I have people constantly walking in front of my car on a green light, no sympathy from me.   


Anyone that owns a car that drives in Greenville should get a dashcam because these people will walk in front of you while its in forward motion on greenlights and solid red no walk signals or begin transit on flashing red and then try to sue you. It happened to me twice now and each time they got BTFOed because the camera showed they were actually in the wrong.  Pedestrians, you have to follow the signals designated for you if they are at the crosswalk. Two of you found out the hard way and ended up paying for the damage to my car. All because you thought you were law gods and could run right in front of traffic and try to farm those law bux.   


This goes for people making turns too and peds just running out into traffic while a car is trying to turn. ya'll bitch about the traffic so much but then you block the cars trying to turn with the 10 seconds they have because you need to cross on flashing or no walk symbol.  


Yeah I know you are all not going to like this but would you prefer to me to tell you or when a Greenville cop actually suddenly decides to do their job for once, you get a ticket for crossing in front of his car and you are standing there like ""wtf mate"". Seen it happen already.

You are describing a very high protein and high phosphorus diet that makes it unlikely for a squirrel to actually survive long enough to bring at least one litter to maturity because of the age they usually begin breeding",t2_7g33rzqh,Affectionate-Meat-98,0,1647926369.0,0,t1_i1mlmzl,i1mlmzl,False,Affectionate-Meat-98,t3_thra7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/thra7l/advice_for_finders_of_orphan_squirrels/,Advice for finders of orphan squirrels,/r/greenville/comments/thra7l/advice_for_finders_of_orphan_squirrels/i1mlmzl/,1,r/greenville,0,1

"Make sure that your ideas include actual mechanics, and the components that make up the ""game"" part of the experience. Many people think they have an idea for a game, but what they actually have is and idea for a cutscene, or a character. This is going to set you on the right path from the start.

There's quite a bit that goes into making one, even something simple like a puzzle, and just as soon as you get a prototype of a mechanic, or even a portion of a game; you'll realize that you can now do better based on what you've learned.

I won't be able to participate in this, but have worked with small teams creating demos and game experiences several years ago.

Fortunately there are many tools available online that will let you practice, create, and publish a fully working video game. Oddly enough I've seen some pretty amateur level games show up on the Playstation Network lately, so there are even more avenues to getting a finished product in front of people.",t2_e11cv,Davez0tron,0,1647870217.0,0,t1_i1j258e,i1j258e,True,Mr_Chapter,t3_tiyi86,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/tiyi86/i_wanna_create_my_video_game_idea/,I wanna Create My Video Game Idea,/r/greenville/comments/tiyi86/i_wanna_create_my_video_game_idea/i1j258e/,6,r/greenville,0,6

"I see a lot of comments for Upstate Swing. They're a great place to learn but the crowd is fairly young overall. I'm not sure how old you are but you mentioned being married so I'm guessing you're not in high school or early college like the majority of them. (Still a fantastic spot though!)

Greenville Westies is on Tuesdays at Sparetime. This is a great group with a variety of ages. It is a completely different style of swing though and is often danced to more modern music. A lot of fun and there's a bar if you need some liquid courage. 

Greenville Lindy Hoppers is every other Thursday at Swamp Rabbit Cafe and Grocery. Lindy hop is a more traditional style of swing and that's shown in the music. You'll find yourself dancing to music from the 30s and 40s. March 31st is the next dance and they're playing soul music for part of the night. (Also sometimes The Swamp gives out free Stecca or desserts at the dance.)

I believe shag just started on Wednesdays at Sparetime. Where Upstate has the youngest crowd, Shag has the oldest. I was told that this week there was over a hundred people so there are definitely people to dance with and learn from! 

There are a ton more options but these are some spots that I can personally vouch for (besides shag but that's in my future lol).
