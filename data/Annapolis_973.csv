"Our rehearsal dinner is in a few weeks so I‚Äôve done a lot of the recon for a party of your size‚Ä¶..a lot of the places mentioned in the comments will get you with those high minimums and/or room buyouts, but you might luck out if it‚Äôs a Thursday. Some ideas beyond some of the traditional special event restaurants:

If you‚Äôre willing to go slightly outside of Downtown Annapolis (5-10 mins), maybe try Cantler‚Äôs‚Ä¶.crab house with the long tables with brown paper, the full deal. I‚Äôve never been to a rehearsal dinner there but I know people who have. Very local vibe. 

I wonder if Forward Brewing in Eastport would be willing to work with you? Definitely worth giving them a call. 

Bringing catering to Quiet Waters is a great idea! Keep timing in mind though because you have to be cleaned up and out of there by dusk.

"Watermark has full-size dinner boats. Probably minimums. Woodwind does small special events. Watermark also has a small boat/large water taxi that can be quite nice. Duffy lets you rent electric boats that might do up to about eight people - you drive. 

Boatyard Bar & Grill will block off one of their two side rooms. Caliente Grill will also. Mangia Italian Grill and Galway Bay Pub both have semi-private areas I've used for small gatherings. 

Rehearsals are usually in the wedding venue. A church? See if the have a social hall you can use and bring in a caterer. I have had good experience with Chesapeake Caterers. 

If the weather is nice you can get Grapes Wine Bar to block off a chunk of their outdoor seating. I did that during Boat Show last Fall for about 30 people and it worked brilliantly. The seating is covered so rain isn't a problem as long as it's warm enough. 

A little off the wall but there is a small local winery called Great Frogs. I believe they have a function room. Just outside City limits and great parking.

"Greene Turtle in Edgewater ([https://thegreeneturtle.com/location/edgewater/](https://thegreeneturtle.com/location/edgewater/)) is plastered in televisions. Every available wall space has a TV, and maybe even some booths\* still. It's obscene. (They used to have a joint near the Annapolis Mall, but it's now a Smashing Grapes which, I suspect, may not have the same television-to-person ratio). The burgers are good, the fish tacos are decent, the crab dip \*can\* be decent if crab is in season, and the Shell Raiser IPA is a collaboration with DuClaw brewing that you can really only find at Greene Turtle. 

If that doesn't fit the bill, just down the road is All American Steakhouse, which somehow has MORE TELEVISIONS than Greene Turtle. The amount of televisions borders on the pornographic. [https://theallamericansteakhouse.com/](https://theallamericansteakhouse.com/) You could reasonably walk between the two. The burgers here probably beat Greene Turtle's. The steaks for sure do. 

And finally, when you want some local flavor and much better wings, you head across the street to Cooper's Tavern (nee Stan & Joe's South) [https://coopers-tavern.com/](https://coopers-tavern.com/). Smaller joint, also TVs everywhere, and from any seat in the place you can see every television. GET THE HOUSE MADE CHIPS and not the bagged-frozen french fries. I'm serious about this. The Sysco frozen fries aren't in the same league as the house-made chips. Hope you like Old Bay.

As for the ""where,"" your top options are going to be around City Dock/Ego Alley downtown (maybe a bit closer to the water, those pipes can carry!). Former Mayor/Governor O'Malley used to busk there with his guitar while he was in office, fun fact. 

Along West Street, I suspect that around Stan-and-Joe's/Ram's Head you'll get some takers, though be sure to find a time when those places aren't having music inside. And right nearby is Church Circle, also might also be a good spot, lots of people walking around there:

"Welcome. I was a master gardener in Virginia. 

First here are some resources:

[https://www.usna.usda.gov/science/plant-hardiness-zone-map/](https://www.usna.usda.gov/science/plant-hardiness-zone-map/)

[https://extension.umd.edu/locations/anne-arundel-county](https://extension.umd.edu/locations/anne-arundel-county)

We're mostly in USDA Zone 7b. Good references will give you dates for seeding outside and guidance for starting inside. Much will depend on the hardiness of the plant. I'm a fan of starting seeds indoors but that depends on space and light you self-discipline to keep seedlings from drying out. Some things (like tomatoes) can be too early as the roots get developed enough and don't tolerate transplanting well when too mature. Some things do really well - bell peppers for example are tender perennials and can even be moved back and forth between pots indoors and the ground over several years. Pansies can be seeded in the ground in early fall and bloom in the fall and then again in spring before the heat of summer knocks them out. 

It's perfectly reasonable to take some risk. Seeds aren't very expensive. Check the packet of seeds you like for guidance for your zone. Plant some inside a couple of weeks early, ""on time,"" and a couple of weeks late. It helps to label. Keep an eye on the weather forecast. A late frost can be managed by heaping mulch or better dry leaves over seedlings. 

Hope this helps.",t2_486ye6x,SVAuspicious,0,1646254591.0,0,t1_hz3jr4v,hz3jr4v,True,DurhamBulls24,t3_t54jge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Annapolis/comments/t54jge/any_gardeners/,Any Gardeners?,/r/Annapolis/comments/t54jge/any_gardeners/hz3jr4v/,4,r/Annapolis,0,4

"For food, I agree with previous posters that Iron Rooster is great for breakfast, but I'm also a big fan of Cafe Normandie.  If you love steaks you absolutely cannot go wrong at Lewnes' steakhouse in Eastport.

"Things to do depends on what interests you. You didn't say when you're coming so some seasonal things may not be available. Schooner Woodwind. The Watermark water taxi has a tour. Duffy's electric boat rental. Quiet Waters Park for a very gentle hike. US Naval Academy tour. There are some moderately interesting tours of historic sites - see the Visitor's Center at City Dock or [visitannapolis.com](https://visitannapolis.com). 

Depending on your standards, eating may disappoint. Annapolis is, in my opinion, a culinary wasteland. Two star food (at best) at four star prices. \*sigh\* There are some bright spots, some for the food and some for a combination of food and what they are. Davis' Pub in Eastport for example is the last real sailing bar/pub in Annapolis. Good bar food, decent prices. Iron Rooster is good for breakfast, less impressive for lunch or dinner. Osteria 177 and Cafe Normandie are good white linen places for dinner. Boatyard Bar and Grill is nice for lunch - I prefer Davis' but Boatyard has more space. Caliente Grill (Mexican/Salvadorean), Jack's Fortune (Chinese), and Lemongrass Too (Thai) are pretty good. Grapes Wine Bar is great for charcuterie and cheese. Water views are surprisingly sparse. Chart House and Carrol's Creek are best - both overpriced. Tastings Gourmet Market has good choices for a picnic along the water at Quiet Waters Park or Truxtun Park.

Dr. Lina Hu at Plaza One in Arnold. 

She has 20+ years experience. She has a great bedside manner, she‚Äôs kind, listens to you. 
I‚Äôve been seeing her for a month, she‚Äôs helped me greatly. 

I had an urgent need and she squeezed me in right away. 

Her prices are better than anyone else I‚Äôve researched. First appointment was $130 vs. $200-$250 what the others were asking. 
Each appointment after is $85.

"Regular question. Regular answer: Annapolis is a culinary wasteland. Tourism drives custom and repeat business isn't important to success so you generally get two star food and four star prices. There are some bright spots. 

A lot depends on whether you have ground transportation and what you are looking for. 

For white linen, Osteria 177 (Italian) and Cafe Normandie (French) are downtown and good. Lewnes (steakhouse) and O'Learys (seafood) are in Eastport. Note that seafood is shipped in - not much local except blue crabs in season. 

Interesting casual places include Davis' Pub in Eastport (sailing bar) and Caliente Grill on Bay Ridge (Salvadorean/Mexican). Jack's Fortunate is the best Chinese we have but you're better off in Chinatown in DC or Baltimore. Rocco's Pizza is pretty good unless your standard is NY/NJ. Grapes Wine Bar is excellent for cheese and carpaccio. 

Very casual lunch at Eastport Kitchen. 

Most of what has been suggested is overpriced tourist places that just isn't very good. $18 small pizzas at Vin909 for example, or most of Main St and West St. 

Carroll's Creek and Chart House (chain) in Eastport are pleasant, overpriced, and have great views. 

If particular cuisines are of interest, out in the county but nearby are Yama (sushi) and Lemongrass Too (Thai - don't confuse with the one on West St).

"Some context on the release.  Maryland tends to be very liberal when it comes to this (shocker, I know). Generally if someone is not charged with a major crime (murder, rape, etc) they are usually considered for release on recognizance. Even if they have a long rap sheet, they are usually released if they have played by the rules in the past--shown up for court dates, made deadlines, reported for probation, etc.   Currently they are also concerned about COVID.  


With that said, in this particular instance, the man does NOT have any criminal record. Over the past decade he has a failure to pay rent, a traffic ticket, a contract dispute, and a state tax lien. The police have the gun and keep in mind that the police did not actively pursue him, he turned himself in.  


I have heard from neighbors who were likely witnesses that he likely was defending his property when the kids were shot.  This jives with the police report that they received a call for a home invasion at his address just prior to getting calls on the shooting.

"YEah it is!  Four days and they have about 70 films this year.  Few will make it to the theaters but that doesn't mean they are bad.  A lot of indy films, shorts, and all segmented by themes.  


Jewish Experience, African American Experience. Sailing Experience, and then other docs. features, and shorts all around the central theme of each year.  


There are chats with directors and producers and actors (some big names we've had here are Rob Reiner, Joanne Froggat, a few others--Reiner was the biggest by far)  


Easily walkable throughout the town. THey have food trucks at most venues ti eat or you can pop into a restaurant between shows.  There are several fest events too-- Opening Night Partty after the opening night film, a Saturday night bash, and a smaller one or two.  


If you have never been to a film fest (I hadn't before this) you will never see all the films, Get the program and read the synopsis and map out a game plan, because some will have you sprinting. Most are shown more than once so you can usually get your top choices in.

They vote via cell phone after each showing so that goes to a peoples choice award at the end, And the final day is the best of the fest with all of the top vote getters being shown in one long afternoon.     


Gets underway like 5pm on Thursday and goes from 9am to 10pm to midnight on Friday and Saturday and then 9am to 8pm or so on Sunday

Unfortunately, since it is February and all, Sun and Ski was also out of any size 13 boots (except for clickers, but I use standard boots), **BUT** everyone there was super cool and friendly, really went the extra mile to assist.

That said: if you're working in state government or lobbyist gig(particularly relating to the legislature/State House) or some kind of federal contracting job, Annapolis is fine. Unfortunately, the town is wealthy so options for housing is limited. $1,500 a month for a studio apartment is the norm, if not moreso due to inflation. If you're committed, [Nautilus Point](https://www.apartments.com/nautilus-point-annapolis-md/2wm2b18/) (formerly Watergate Apartments) is a usual go-to for the young and new to the area crowd. A bit further out is [Annapolis Roads](https://www.wm-annapolisroad.com/). *Don't* rent anything from King Properties. 

Unfortunately, the town is aging so there are limited options for the younger crowd in terms of entertainment beyond a few staples which get boring after a few rounds. Most of those places are along West Street and downtown.

"I have 3a / 3b curly hair and finding a stylist that knows how to handle my hair has been equal to the quest for the holy grail. 

I happened to find a coworker‚Äôs wife that is a stylist - her daughter has similar, but much longer hair. I gave her a try and was happy with the result. My hair is a bit on the wild side, it doesn‚Äôt settle well until about a week after the cut so I wasn‚Äôt sure how it came out at first, but a few washes later, I was happy with it. 

My hair was long, close to my waist. I don‚Äôt know if she does dry cuts, mine was a wet cut. Her name is Ashley.

She charged $45 for a cut, with tip I came under your budget. 

The salon is about 35 min south of Annapolis but well worth the drive.

"I bought a house in one of your preferred areas last April. I had been looking at houses for 7-8 months. I had an experienced agent that knew the market very well and had a good network of other agents. 

Out of nine offers I put on homes, I lost eight. Two out of the eight were lost to investors. Both those houses needed a lot of rework / demo. The other ones were daily move-in ready. 

I‚Äôll say this much. You won‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre up against until after an offer is accepted. The agents are not allowed to disclose (on either side) the cards they have in hand. 

Some sleazy (seller‚Äôs) agents will disclose that they have ‚Äúx‚Äù amount of offers with no escalation clause and waiving inspections, etc. 
I‚Äôd stay away from those properties because the agents is: a) they sleazy; b) they‚Äôre shopping yours or someone else‚Äôs number; c) they‚Äôre dishonest; d) it‚Äôs illegal / unethical 

I think in-town Annapolis you‚Äôre likely to see investors or AirBnB type seekers. Out of town it‚Äôs mostly people moving to the area.

"I think it depends on what part of the market you are looking at. We‚Äôve been helping our son get a starter home and it has been an almost 2 year process. He is handy and was looking for a place he could work on but everything he looked at got snapped up in a day or two by investors and flippers who came in with cash and a quick settlement. The higher end it is the regular people who are driving prices up. My son‚Äôs realtor said that he‚Äôs seen incidences of people making direct payments to sellers in addition to the contract offer, I guess to keep the commission lower. Stuff should be coming back down, though. Foreclosures are going to be going up because the Covid protections and exceptions are going away and the big real estate companies that thought they could get into the flipping business are having to sell a lot of them off (looking at you, Zillow! https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758176/zillow-offers-ibuyer-housing-market-inventory-investors-real-estate).

#mdtraffic ALERT | Honor Detail for a fallen Paramedic | Many of you are asking about the activity near Anne Arundel Medical Center (AAMC) in Annapolis. Please read the press release regarding this man, and the sacrifice he made for his community. 
LINE OF DUTY DEATH OF PARAMEDIC/ FIREFIGHTER ROBERT A. JONES
Carroll County Department of Fire & EMS, Reese & Community Volunteer Fire Company (RVFC), and Carroll County Professional Fire Fighters & Paramedics Local 5184 jointly announce with profound sadness the Line of Duty Death of Career Paramedic/Firefighter Robert A. ‚ÄúBobby‚Äù Jones.
Paramedic/Firefighter Jones was exposed to and contracted COVID-19 while performing his duties serving the citizens of Carroll County, Maryland in December 2021. After a hard fight and multiple complications, he succumbed to the virus on January 20, 2022. His death represents the first in the Line of Duty Death for the Reese & Community Volunteer Fire Company, newly formed Carroll County Department of Fire & EMS, and IAFF Local 5184.
Jones‚Äôs dedication to the fire service began when he joined the Woodlawn Volunteer Fire Company on September 19, 1978, where remained a member until his death. The Fire Service became a career choice on February 28, 1982, when he entered the Baltimore County Fire Department Academy (BCoFD) as a firefighter recruit. Jones served the BCoFD as a Paramedic/Firefighter at various stations until calling Station 4D (Catonsville) home until his retirement as a Fire Lieutenant on April 4, 2012.  
Besides his years with the Baltimore County Fire Department, Jones called the Reese & Community Volunteer Fire Company in Westminster his second home and family. He joined the staff of Reese as a Paramedic in the late 1980‚Äôs working part-time until he became a full-time Paramedic, Fire Fighter, Engineer in January 2007. Since that time, he has served the Community as a paramedic, firefighter, engineer, and shift supervisor.
Jones also volunteered at Lansdowne Volunteer Fire Company from 2011-2013 and Cape St. Claire Volunteer Fire Company from January 2013, until his death where he was promoted on May 19, 2021, as a Fire Lieutenant, by the Anne Arundel County Fire Department. Additionally, he was a career-long member of IAFF Local 1311 (Baltimore County Professional Fire Fighters) and Local 5184 (Carroll +County Professional Fire Fighters & Paramedics).

I would say look at West Annapolis. Has its own little Main Street and is close to downtown but quiet. I would not buy anything that requires going down Forest Drive. That includes H√≠llsmere and Arundel on the Bay. Those neighborhoods are lovely but the egress in and out is a true traffic nightmare. Every time I have to go that way I am so thankful we do not live there. Edgewater is ok but does not feel like Annapolis.  Epping Forest is nice and you might think about other neighborhoods along Generals Highway although the traffic there can also be hellish in the afternoon once you get much further north.,t2_639eyero,SassM7753,0,1641878951.0,0,t1_hs66qm3,hs66qm3,True,supermomfake,t3_s0isnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Annapolis/comments/s0isnn/quietest_areas/,Quietest areas,/r/Annapolis/comments/s0isnn/quietest_areas/hs66qm3/,2,r/Annapolis,0,2

"I can't think of a way to achieve all of your requirements. If you can sacrifice the minimal light pollution, I'd recommend West Annapolis or Eastport. Both have areas that are off main roads, easy walking to bars/restaurants in the neighborhoods and downtown, and near driving to shopping and groceries.  

The downsides are traffic, mainly. Eastport is all the way down the peninsula so it takes a while to get out to the highway in good conditions - though there are a few routes so you won't necessarily get stuck. West Annapolis is close to the Severn River Bridge which can get backed up. West Annapolis is close to Navy-Marine Corp Stadium which messes with traffic and parking during Navy home games - plus you'll be able to hear the announcer. 

Annapolis as a whole can have a small town feel.

Hiking day trips: Annapolis Rock (despite the name, it's actually far away, on the AT), Patapsco Valley State Park, National Arboretum, Great Falls

You can Kayak out of Quiet Waters.

On your first day, acclimate yourself to downtown Annapolis. Church Circle, the State House, Main Street, City Dock. Just walk around and take note of bars and restaurants that catch your eye. You can also venture down Maryland Ave, further up West St, or into Eastport to find more. Take the haunted bar crawl one night early on, too. 

Lots to do in DC. Contact your congressman to see if they're running any free tours. I've done the Capitol and Pentagon. Library of Congress, National Archives, Smithsonian museums. National Harbor is fun, especially at night. Go to a Nationals game.

"In theory, you can save some money on your electric bill (10-15% in the short term) by shopping around for other providers.   But, you would definitely want to shop around here (and DO NOT just go with someone walking around your neighborhood):

https://www.mdelectricchoice.com/shop/


In practice, I didn't save any money, and it was a hassle.  The ones that offer a decent savings are ones with Intro rates or shorter contract terms that will go up later.  You might think you can just switch providers when the Intro rate goes up, but it often takes several months to get the switch done. So, I ended up losing all of the savings after the rates jacked up.  And, that is if you actually remember to change the provider exactly when you should and the provider isn't shady.  **IMO, shopping around for electricity providers is a waste of time.**

"I didn't put in anything specifically about the LGBTQ+ environment because the culture has changed so much over the past few years, and I honestly don't know what AHS is like now on that front- but I had several friends who were out (or closeted but obviously queer) who didn't have particular problems. There were also a few people who are out as trans or NB now and wore non-gender conforming clothes to school at the time who were popular and active in extracurriculars. I didn't go to any of the other AA high schools, so I would hesitate to compare, but from talking to other people AHS is much more willing to live and let live-across the social and political spectrum- than some of the more homogenous schools are. This may be less true within specific social groups (i.e. a given club or sports team might be more or less accepting of people who don't fit in to whatever their vibe is) but is very true across the school as a whole. There is also a great cross-country trail system behind the school, and the track team specifically is very open and accepting; since people who play other sports often do track in their off-season, when I was there it was one of the best places to meet people you might not hang out with otherwise.",t2_xu7r5dk,schmatteganai,0,1641239517.0,0,t1_hr444yt,hr444yt,False,supermomfake,t3_rtkcmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Annapolis/comments/rtkcmn/high_schools/,High Schools,/r/Annapolis/comments/rtkcmn/high_schools/hr444yt/,1,r/Annapolis,0,1

"I went to Annapolis high school, and the AP and IB offerings can give people a really great, rigorous academic background; I did AP classes and tested into the junior level in several areas when I went to college, and got a scholarship to a prestigious school, my sister did IB and was well prepared for a scholarship spot at another prestigious school; I'm not going to say which here because it might dox me, but feel free to DM me if you have questions. There are lots of great opportunities to meet people from all over the city and make connections that especially help if your student is interested in the Navy or local government later on, and plenty of my classmates got scholarships to selective schools, for academics and athletics. I was fluent in Spanish by the time I graduated, and both could talk to people from the Salvadoran neighborhood and got top scores in the Spanish AP tests. The haters here are being ridiculous.

Annapolis High School is the most diverse school in Anne Arundel county, and draws people from a wide variety of neighborhoods and backgrounds. That can cause some conflict, but when I was there it was perfectly easy to stay out of conflicts if you were polite to people and didn't try to start trouble- and it also means that after graduating you know people from every neighborhood in town, and are less likely to generalize about people or be rude to or afraid of people with different backgrounds than yours.",t2_xu7r5dk,schmatteganai,0,1641077879.0,0,t1_hqv25zm,hqv25zm,True,supermomfake,t3_rtkcmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Annapolis/comments/rtkcmn/high_schools/,High Schools,/r/Annapolis/comments/rtkcmn/high_schools/hqv25zm/,6,r/Annapolis,0,6

"I graduated from Broadneck around the same time and my experience was very different. Very divided among different groups, especially along academic lines which meant socioeconomic and racial lines effectively. The sports teams are pretty good, and I really enjoyed my experience in marching band, but I know even that went downhill fast after I left because it went under new direction. The level of academics was also kind of a joke. AP biology teachers who say ‚Äúevolution is just a theory‚Äù and ‚Äúrefute‚Äù it with Christian talking points, AP political science teachers who say ‚ÄúBush is the greatest president of all time and if you don‚Äôt think so you‚Äôre a communist,‚Äù and an AP statistics teacher who was voted teacher of the freaking year who just joked around and taught us nothing. That school is also ableist, I was very ill through high school and they tried to expel me a number of times despite me having straight A‚Äôs in all AP and honors classes because I missed too many days and offering me no accommodations.

"My daughter recently graduated from South River...great school. Great teachers and very engaged counselors to help kids find their best path.  Set her up for success at university. 

We had a foreign exchange student stay with is one year and she went to Annapolis high. I'd say her experience was mixed and not ideal. Plenty of AP classes, although the number of kids who wanted to be high achievers there seemed like a much smaller pool compared to South River. Based on  communications from the school to parents the environment seemed much less safe than you would ever want for your kids.
