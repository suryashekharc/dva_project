I, personally, don't find burlesque ""weird"" but it is outside of the mainstream at the moment. 

There's literally an advertisement for a burlesque show in this sub right now. And they are not even one of the longer running ones in the area, though I've heard good things about them. 

That's just something happening right now, essentially, that would not been happening in every city in the state.

"Charlotte has plenty....  Most people just don't know about it.

Art:. 

VAPA in uptown just opened up and is huge. This will be the new HQ for up and coming art, music, comedy and more with improv shows, sketch shows, and even an off Broadway group taking residence there.

NoDa still has a few galleries.  Don't forget the art Art League that moved to the outskirts of NoDa a couple years back.

Southend has a huge art scene with dillworth artist station, C3 labs and a few others that do gallery crawls.

Comedy:

Here is the not so secret secret about Charlotte.  The comedy scene here is legit and second only to a few other major cities in terms of  venue counts, and places with stage time for up and coming comics.  There are open mics almost 5 days a week and at least 10 alternative venues running weekly paid shows outside of the comedy zone.

Music:

We have a ton of thriving talent, and st least 5 to 10 decent small venues and 3 to 5 major venues for national acts.

People that talk shit about Charlotte not having scene really don't know what we even have to begin with 99% of the time.",t2_197bye31,PitifulNose,0,1648263659.0,0,t1_i25f0dr,i25f0dr,True,30acresisenough,t3_toe9bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/toe9bp/when_folks_tried_to_make_charlotte_weird/,When folks tried to make Charlotte weird,/r/Charlotte/comments/toe9bp/when_folks_tried_to_make_charlotte_weird/i25f0dr/,9,r/Charlotte,0,9

"You will get a lot of downvotes from people who believe you just haven't gone out and looked enough. They will point you to the whitewater center and The Mint museum, etc. I sometimes wonder if they are being intentionally disingenuous or if they really believe an item here or there they can point to is what makes a city. 

 Then there are those who totally understand that it's the vibe which is missing. Charlotte is a giant suburb.  The real creative city neighborhood walkability cultural explosion that should exist in a city of 800,000 people is non-existent. 

This website shows that people have been trying for a long time to create it, but Charlotte from the beginning was seen as the rare southern town that was commerce enabled, and they mowed down whatever they had to in order to keep it that way. ( That all took place way before northerners moved in, regardless of what local folks say.) 

Now they are attempting to retroactively put some culture back in. But it doesn't stick.

"I’m similar to you, recent college grad (though admittedly a bit older than most new college grads) and moving to Charlotte for a new job over the summer.  It’s definitely hard to get a sense of the neighborhoods and places without going in person and I did that recently last weekend.  South End is kind of pricey so unless you are willing to do a studio I’d say $1700 would be hard to find many options there.  I personally didn’t like the vibes of South End too much (too busy constantly) but it is kind of considered the ideal place for young people.  NoDa and Plaza Midwood are good too from what I’ve heard and seen, less crazy but still plenty going on.  I also really liked the Wesley Heights area and the Gateway area near Frazier park/third ward.  They felt more like a neighborhood and quieter but still have places to eat and what not.  I also found these areas to have cheaper rents but still very close to Uptown for work.

Day laborers refers to anyone looking to work a temporary job until they can find something permanent. The worker is hired and paid one day at a time, with no promise that more work will be available in the future. That's about as far from racist as it gets. 

The reference to ""slim pickens""(please get the quote right if you're going to) is that means that those guys may get hired early by the first people who show up looking to pay them a wage. So when there's only a few, versus the many back in the day here, a person needs to be there early or there won't be anyone to hire.

"So out of curiosity I started looking to see if there were any plots on OG vs. final ABV. I agree with what you’ve said in terms of higher OG beers will typically be higher ABV, but want to see if any home brew forums etc. had pulled some data on it.

Couple things I found 

https://www.rpubs.com/correap/544149
There’s a plot of OG  vs. ABV at the bottom, unsurprisingly linear (except for a bunch of weird outliers close to 1 that is throwing off the linear trend line, too lazy to read the whole thing but I’m guessing bad data) 


Another interesting comparison of OG vs. FG by beer style. I don’t see any with narrow gaps between OG and FG, with a also a relatively high FG, so just more data to support your point IMO.  Strong scotch ale might be the closest, but that’s high ABV

"First goal:  connect students to future careers 

Math at retail like target is done by computers, middle schoolers are old/smart enough to realize that. 

I don’t think “hey look you can work at target” is gonna be a great pitch to middle schoolers about why they should pay attention in math class.

Second goal: push further as an educator 

Target isn’t going to hire someone part time seasonal off the street to do budgeting, HR, or anything that (might???) be applicable to school leadership or teaching different subjects. 

Discount is a good point, but doesn’t meet either of the goals they listed.

I have no suggestions for part time jobs, but I’ve had success in doing volunteer hour of code sessions w/ middle schoolers. Maybe discovery place, WWC, etc. have summer coding programs.


Another idea I just thought of:

"The  problem is if you are on opiates, they urine test you, and if you have decided to try marijuana in order to cut your opiate usage way down, you will be punished. They will blacklist you.  If they detect CBD, you may also be blacklisted because they are tired of people using the excuse that it's not marijuana, it's CBD. 

I also suffer from epilepsy.  Diseases and disorders both -there is a list. The point is instead of just making this plant legal, they have decided to limit its use even if they legalize it. And then they need to explain to me why they don't make alcohol or caffeine or nicotine illegal.

"Everyone here is so negative on it so I’ll be the contrarian. It’ll be before 2030. 

Views on marijuana are strongly correlated with age, so every death and every 18th birthday tilts the balance just a little bit more. 

Retail sales in Virginia begin in 2024 IIRC, and a lot of that is going to make its way into NC. While there aren’t any large NC population centers right on the border, Winston-Salem, Greensboro and Raleigh are close enough for a legal purchase and ample selection to be worth the trip. 

Someone will naturally want to put a dispensary conspicuously close to the state line. 

After that, it won’t be long until NC wises up to the money they’re leaving on the table enforcing marijuana laws with no offsetting sales taxes that VA is enjoying. 

The federal government is also a wild card. I mean, last election cycle marijuana legalization was basically a semi-campaign promise by the Democratic party, and although it didn’t happen, it’s telling that it was actually a relevant issue used to get out the vote. 

I consider federal decisions more of a wildcard. Who knows what it (or Congress) will look like over the next 8 years (before my 2030 timeline) but federal action is definitely not a negative to the odds of legal weed in NC.",t2_161vh9,CharlotteRant,0,1648182882.0,0,t1_i20zybe,i20zybe,True,UnderstandingNo3595,t3_tnb7ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/tnb7ae/medical_marijuana/,Medical marijuana,/r/Charlotte/comments/tnb7ae/medical_marijuana/i20zybe/,43,r/Charlotte,0,43

"It was just a couple of decades ago that we were allowed to finally purchase mixed drinks.... 

Also, the Republicans are boasting that medical marijuana laws in NC will be one of the strictest if we ever pass legal - PTSD for veterans will be on the list because veterans have a great lobby, but no chronic pain or arthritis. 

It will be diseases like epilepsy. 

Idiots. 

 Strict laws mean more people will use black market. 

I'm furious because I have severe arthritis pain, and they are willing to give me opiates, but not marijuana. My family lives in places you just walk down the street to the local weed  store  and do not have to worry that someone is mixing toxic stuff into your pot. 

When my family comes to visit, they find it barbaric that we would have to go into a neighborhood and we have no idea WTF is in our purchase.

"Slim pickings.

Here, technically in Hoover, AL just outside Birmingham, back in the day there might be hundreds. It's probably not like that anymore. There were three apartment complexes right in a row on the corner of a couple of somewhat busy streets. A few gas stations and a couple of restaurants were there.

If you pulled up in a pickup truck you just hold up fingers to show how many guys you needed. They'd practically fight each other to get in the truck. I never had too many get in, but someone I know said guys he didn't need jumped in the back. I don't really know how he dealt with it.

But they tore down one or maybe two of those complexes and put up a Walmart. Plus that city took effort to get rid of those guys. They opened up a city building down the street and tried to make it official and regulate it. I don't think that worked.
