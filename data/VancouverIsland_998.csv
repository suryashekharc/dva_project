"It‚Äôs less then a million spread across the entire island. 

RV camping is hard to find spots anywhere in western Canada these days. 

The ferry has always been busy. Yes it has gotten busier lately but book a reservation, or take off peak hour boats. I‚Äôve traveled to the main land several times in the past year no issues no waits. 

The ferry costs around $90 each way for 2 people and a car. Expensive yes but it‚Äôs not ten times the cost it was even 2 decades ago.

"The Island in May is pretty warm in the day (15-21 C) and cooler at night (usually single digits).  Your chance of dipping below freezing are zero unless you're at elevation.  Expect to spend at least one night and day in the rain, likely more, but you'll also likely get sun as well.  If you camp on the coast the fog will be entertaining.   I like to bring 2 tarps, one for over my tent to augment the rain fly, and another to set up as a roof so I'm not stuck inside all day if it's torrential.  There will be lots of loose  wood around and you'll get excited for a fire, but it'll all be damp or wet and keeping the fire going will require constant supervision until the bed of coals gets going.  Stay warm using wool or synthetic as much as possible in case it gets wet.  The mud here is real.  Be ready.   


Something that hasn't yet been mentioned is that in the spring the bears will be active, but there's not much food for them yet, so they'll be a little more bold about looking for stuff.  Be diligent about bear safety like cooking food well away from where you sleep, hanging your food at night and knowing how to not look like something they want to eat should you have an encounter.   The bears on the island are pretty chill, you likely either won't see them or you'll just see the back end of one taking off so don't let this discourage you.   It's worth noting that there are a good amount of cougars and wolves here too, so read up on how to handle them too.    


As for camping spots, most people I know avoid the campgrounds because they're expensive, often booked months in advance, and full of RV's.  So most of us just find old logging roads and pull over near rivers to camp.  It's hard to describe in terms of a tip. But if you can get your hands on the Backroads Mapbook, you can have a lot of fun exploring.    


You will not have phone reception for large chunks driving between Port Alberni and Tofino, and again driving between Tofino and Port Renfrew if you take the gravel roads.  For that matter you won't have reception for long periods between Renfrew and Sooke.   I have a Satellite Communicator for emergencies.  It might be overkill for a 9 day visit.    


If you can make the time to check out Youbou (pronounced You-bow for .... reasons), do it.  You have a very high chance of seeing Elk near or in the town, or at the campsite on the north point of Lake Cowichan.  The road from Port Alberni to Bamfield is brutal right now due to the winter and logging trucks, so be ready to vibrate the whole way and get the extra insurance if you're using a rental vehicle.   The ""highway"" from Port Alberni to Tofino is currently under construction and you can get caught for up to an hour waiting to be flagged through as the workers blast rock.  When you see signs for construction ahead, take the time to stop and use the washroom if you have any need at all just to be safe.

"The Island is fairly warm in May. Warning, it can rain any time of year, but May is usually warm. There are all sorts of private and public campgrounds on the Island. Be aware there is a blasting job on the road (Hwy 4) to Tofino. Expect delays. They have a FB page. I would stay in the national park (camping) in Tofino or one of the luxury accommodations on the beach. Or try Ucluelet. For temperatures, you are better off looking at historical weather information online. The gear you bring depends on what you want to do. Whale watching in Victoria means good waterproof gear, or you might want to climb the Golden Hinde. The north end of the Island has fantastic views from mountains to sea side. Go for lunch at the Dingy Dock (free ferry) in Nanaimo Harbour, or try a visit to Saltspring Island.

"I‚Äôd go for Comox Valley (Comox/Courtenay/Cumberland) area rather than either of your choices.

"I was born in Campbell and lived there until I went off to university. Campbell river is definitely growing and there are some drug problems but you wouldn‚Äôt notice it unless you walked around a certain part of downtown. I go back there to visit family sometimes. I grew up near the hospital (near downtown) but recently moved to stories beach (willow point area)

Willow point (newer suburban area) is a good place for a family to live. The sea wall and ocean views run right though Campbell so doesn‚Äôt matter where you live, you get to have an accessible view. Also there are tons of families that live there if your are looking for that kind of community. It‚Äôs slightly less sketchy too, but a 15 min drive away from downtown. Newer houses and young professionals. 

Beaver lodge lands is a giant park that is also right in the middle of Campbell river and it runs from the older part of town to the start of willow point. It‚Äôs about 8km of beautiful forest with plenty of trails. Good place to take kids on a fairly flat, maintained trail. 

I lived in the older part growing up and loved that I could drive into the middle of nature within 20 mins. The lake (mcIvor) is also a 15 min drive away from downtown if you‚Äôre want to swim and the river is also a nice place to swim which runs right though Campbellton. Owning a boat is a game changer because you can explore the beauty so easily - also fishing is super popular in the summer. Hiking is awesome too. There is hiking of all levels from 10 mins away - 1.5 hours away. Strathcona provincial park is 45 mins away and has amazing hikes that are well marked. 

One thing I will say is that the high-schools don‚Äôt offer IB or AP curriculum to students. This is just due to lack of teachers and students wanting to go to post secondary. I‚Äôm sure the education is better now, but when I graduated (2018) we didn‚Äôt even have a proper/constant chemistry teacher which made me feel super behind my other peers at UBC. The trade off though is that I grew up without much school stress at all (no homework, never studied, still got straight A‚Äôs) - played every sport, went to the beach during lunchtime and went skiing on weekends. Nanaimo has more schools and more options when it comes to your kids education so you might want to keep that in mind. Campbell rivers high schools didn‚Äôt offer me much support when it came to post secondary education. Applications and counselling was all on me and only the self motivated kids in my grade went to uni. The school offers a lot of support for Trades though. This will all improve, however as the town grows. 

Also to answer your questions - no weather difference really. They‚Äôre both coastal. Campbell river is extremely wet tho and the highway can get nasty if you‚Äôre trying to drive to Nanaimo to catch a ferry. 

Things to do with kids during the day: I used to baby sit 3 boys and they loved going to the beach. There is a sandy beach called Saratoga which is great in the summer, but also the rocky beaches at low tide are bursting with life that kids love to explore. The lake is also a fun option if you‚Äôre into that. What‚Äôs been popular in recent years is ‚ÄúVelocity‚Äù which is basically a driving range at a golf course but you get served food and drinks while you watch your friends play. It has comfy seating and there is sensors in the range which tell you how far you‚Äôve driven the ball. This would be a relaxing option for parents because you can order some nachos and beer while watching your kids compete and have fun. Also enjoyed kayaking, skiing on mount Washington and mount Cain, fly fishing, ocean fishing, hiking and biking growing up there. 

Let me know if you have any questions I‚Äôll be happy to answer.",t2_9a5dx7pz,Clean_Comedian3227,0,1648048960.0,0,t1_i1sztgi,i1sztgi,True,stressedmom_1289,t3_tkuq3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/comments/tkuq3d/thinking_about_moving_to_nanaimo_or_campbell/,Thinking about moving to Nanaimo or Campbell River from Northern AB.,/r/VancouverIsland/comments/tkuq3d/thinking_about_moving_to_nanaimo_or_campbell/i1sztgi/,21,r/VancouverIsland,0,21

"Nanaimo and CR are my two least favourite places on the island! Haha! But if I had to pick, I'd say Nanaimo because it's bigger and obviously more centralized, with more options for schools, neighborhoods, etc. As mentioned above, it has a university and obviously more amenities.

My next point I mention because over the years I've seen so many families posting about a lack of housing or high costs after they've already made the decision to move. Please take into account housing and your budget. Buying a house here is incredibly expensive. Renting a house is not only expensive, but difficult. Landlords are ""not allowed to discriminate based on children"", but they do. Add a pet into the mix if you have one? Eeeep.

"The road never killed anyone. They unfortunately died as a result of a very bad decision to drive a bus on that road after dark. It is a resource road, that is the original agreement between the citizens of Bamfield and the private operation that built and uses that road for resource development. The BC government decided to get involved and started paying for road maintenance, so vehicles like tour buses could also use it (at their own risk). Last time I tried driving down that road, I turned around at the gravel pit after a couple of kilometers on gravel. There were so many potholes and large over-sized logging trucks were coming around corners ""on my side of the road"". This is typical of resource roads in BC.

My first recommendation is Newcastle Island. (Saysutshun) it is a small island off Nanaimo that can be reached via a 10 minute ferry ride from downtown Nanaimo. The entire island is a nature park, there are no roads, only trails. It takes a couple of hours to walk around the entire island. There are so many lovely spots to just sit and be. The view from any spot is incredible. There is a small store/caf√© open in the summer months, but I would take food and whatever you need for the day with you. You can even take a bike on the ferry if that is your jam. I always take my bike but it‚Äôs not for everyone.

"I heard about there being a serial killer somewhere in the valley by some locals before coming out to the island so I may have already had the jitters going into this.

So I (35M) was just recently up island near Courtney/Comox and had a weird experience where a man pulled out behind my truck when I slowly drove by on a backroad. I was looking for a trail I saw on satellite images. He would have easily been able to spot my out-of-province plates I think. 

Anyways I found the spot but the guy literally followed me right to it. I started down the trail head and got a strange sensation and felt a little paranoid about that guy so I turned around and headed back to my truck. I grabbed my survival knife and a water bottle. I pretended I had come back for a water bottle, and headed back down the trail. I looked back and the man, who I could make out now to be maybe mid forties and thin, had started to follow me down the trail as well. I guess he could just be coming to the same trail as me, I thought, and I'm being a little paranoid about it. So I figured I would test if he's just heading down the same trail as me or there is something else I'm missing here.

I decided to veer off onto a convenient side trail right away and feigned some excitement about a big ass tree and pulled out my phone and snapped some pictures. I looked through the trees and could see the man that had followed me stopped when I looked at him. He turned around and went back to his car (grey dodge challenger) and drove away.

I have no idea what that whole scenario was and if I was ever in real danger, but fuck that story or the Van Island serial killer getting in my head either made me paranoid or maybe it saved my life!

"Ugh. Grew up there and it makes me depressed every time I go to visit my parents.

Fermi owns most of the town. 

It rains all the time. 

There's no trades or services locally. My parents needed someone to fix their heat pump and had to pay $400 to have someone come from Campbell River. He didn't have the part, so they get to pay another $400 to have him come back with the part.

"Cathedral Grove, Englishman Falls, Little Qualicum Falls, and Hole in the Wall are easy hikes nearby. You can hit Goats On A Roof as well.

There's a hotel up near Nanaimo that has a lovely spa with a water circuit you can do. 

The water near Ladysmith can be quite warm. Worth looking into renting a kayak. Duncan Farmer's Market is really awesome. 

In Victoria there's hot tub boats. You can wander downtown and take a water taxi to Fisherman's Wharf. Quazars has pinball! Little Jumbo for a beautiful dinner. Tapas/Bodega for afternoon snacks. There's a kosher bakery in Hudson's Market that makes the best soft pretzels. Red Fish Blue Fish for fish & chips/chowder. Honestly- it's worth it to book a night or two in Vic. There's a lot to do. 

You can take the ferry across Brentwood Bay and rent kayaks there (they also have lessons). North of Butchart in Sidney is Farmer's Daughter- great place for a bite and to load up on cheeses. Roost Winery and Howl Brewing are in between.

"You can refer to the map in my above comment for general guidelines about hunting. Map A5 shows Victoria to Port Renfrew. There is also no shooting in CRD parks or in the Greater Victoria water supply area. Keep in mind that hunting is not a year round activity, so you can look up when hunting season is for animals in your area and plan accordingly. If someone is shooting recreationally you'll be able to hear them from a fair distance. Hunters, maybe less so... Hunting isn't allowed on private land without permission of the land owner, and I'm not entirely sure if it's allowed on the various tree farm license areas around Sooke.

"The general rule on the island is shot only if you're east of the powerlines, rifle is okay if you're west of them. There are maps available from the provincial government but those technically apply to hunting.  Doumont is outside of city limits so their bylaws don't apply. Technically speaking it's not explicitly illegal to shoot up Doumont way, however... you do need to be aware of whatever is behind what you're shooting at, and you need to ensure that you're shooting safely, which includes having due regard for other back country users who either are present or could reasonably be expected to be present. I personally would not feel comfortable shooting at Doumont.

I used to shoot up Timberlands way, but with how busy it's gotten to be over the last few years I'm no longer comfortable going up that way either. There are other spots further in the bush with lower traffic and better backstops, IMHO. For what it's worth I am not a lawyer or an expert on firearms laws, I just like shooting and always try do so legally and as safely as possible. In my view an accident like this up Timberlands Road was inevitable, given how busy that area is and how popular it is for shooting.

Edited to add: Here's the island shooting areas map...

"I didn't know that - but I can see why.

There are some pretty populace herds up the Salmon and White River drainages.

I'm also a big fan of the healthy predator populations that these herds support.  Though not seen very often, I've run across sign of wolf packs on the Salmon River that indicate packs with multiple members, and I've crossed Cougar sign on the sand bars often enough to guess there's a healthy number of them, as well.

Too bad we ""allow"" unregulated hunting of both those predator species, as the Elk and thier predators have obviously found a healthy balance in these areas.

"Mount Washington isn't far from Comox and [Paradise Meadows](https://www.discovervancouverisland.com/medium-hikes-by-region/north-central-island/paradise-meadows/) is gorgeous. If you bring some seed with you then you can almost certainly have whiskeyjacks come land on and eat out of your hand, which might be fun for your kids. The same area also has access to longer hikes that are well worth it, but maybe not right for your family.

Roughly halfway between Port Alberni and Nanaimo is [Cathedral Grove](https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/macmillan/). That's a good one if you want tall trees. It isn't as good, imo, as [Avatar Grove](https://ancientforestalliance.org/photos/avatar-grove/), but that one is out near Port Renfrew and only accessibly via logging roads so might be too far from Comox for you. If you did want to go to it then you should try and plan for Botanical Beach as well. The tide pools there are fantastic and there are some good trails along the cliffs to check out.

If you think you might enjoy caving then Horne Lake caves aren't too far from Comox. If you don't mind going further out than Upana or Little Huson are also great options further North. Little Huson and Nimpkish Lake are gorgeous, so would be high on my list of things to do North Island. Little Huson you won't need a guide or special gear as it is more open and well signed/trailed. Horne Lake and Upana you will definitely need to sign on with a tour group.

Rights you seem to not understand.

Cause they can. Because the Fed Govt used tyrannical force to evict them from a peaceful protest. 

>No, this was based on science, not whining babies making selfish demands.

Nothing the BC govt has done in the last year has been about science. It's about control. They knew the science said vaxports for work. Keeping people inside doesn't work. Restaurants were never these super spreaders. Interestingly enough, the SkyTrain, packed to the gills every day, for 18 hours as day; crickets. If it was about safety, then why not address this?

Simply put; you and many like you have forgotten what civil rights are. You live in nice neighborhoods, you have a good quality of life. Very NIMBY. The moment those dirty workers speak up .....fuck them. But you will praise them for making sure you have soy milk in your latte and out of season fruits and vegetables. When did the left becomes pro war, anti free speech, pro big pharma, anti protest, anti pro choice (still pro abortion, but that's it.). 

You speak down to people who question how fucked up these mandates are or, who don't agree. You'll label them every name, while NOT giving a reasonable answer. 

Your ancestors who for the rights to protest are looking down on you in a bad way. You think they'd be for people losing their jobs cause they won't get a Vax, that doesn't stop spread or infection? When there are alternate remedies that not only work but make you better positioned to fight covid? (All science based btw). 

You e only ever know good times. You never fought for shit. You never sacrificed for shit, but you'll stand on the shoulders of giants and act like you actually did something.

How many countries exist? I bet they each have an official governmental science page talking about the legitimate efficacy of vaccines. The reason we needed mandates is because the anti-vax propaganda was *everywhere* so people were duped into believing a false narrative. 

Masks are a common piece of PPE that have been in use, preventing spread of respiratory illness, for *decades*. If you don't think they were, you were tricked. Simple as that.

You think surgeons and doctors and nurses are all part of some global cabal conspiracy committed to getting you to wear a mask for... reasons?
