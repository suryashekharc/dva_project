"That is the most irrelevant anecdote I think I have ever heard.

We are not talking about a factory constructed to create employment with pointless jobs here like catching product at the end of a line or keeping people a the plant to collect a subsidy.

>Surely it would cost less to build a solar panel factory than it would to build a nuclear power plant. Wind power would help. I see a lot of windmills south of the border. Batteries help with the peaks loads

No, not if you are trying to use solar for peak load. Not to mention you are exporting the wealth out of province, because the panels and batteries aren't produced here.

The whole concept around SMR's is that we design them and can copy the same blueprints over and over vastly cutting costs on procurement and construction. Everything can be pre-fabbed off sight in shops, and thrown together on sight in a modular style, increasing the build quality and speed of construction and dropping costs all along the way. Once the plants are up and running operations from any facility can run any of the other facilities as they are all carbon copies of one another, cutting costs on having to train or re-train staff, and making filling shifts more flexible as staff can be moved around.",t2_5isr50xr,Rusholme_and_P,0,1648278660.0,0,t1_i261e2y,i261e2y,False,NorthernStarLord,t3_to0u3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/to0u3b/will_be_changed_very_shortly_premier_confident/,'Will be changed very shortly': Premier confident nuclear energy generation will be coming to Sask.,/r/saskatchewan/comments/to0u3b/will_be_changed_very_shortly_premier_confident/i261e2y/,1,r/saskatchewan,0,1

"No you apparently don’t understand so let me spell it out for you

Addicts exist. This is a fact. Whether you think it’s a moral flaw or not does not negate the fact that addiction is a problem that our society has and must deal with one way or another.

Most addicts who die of drug overdose die because they consumed the drugs ALONE - it doesn’t matter how nice of a home or car you have. It doesn’t matter what kind of job a person has. What makes people die of ODs is using their drugs alone and using drugs that are not what they claim to be (they think they’re taking one thing or one strength but they instead used the half of the pill that had all the medication and none of the filler for example).

Given that these people exist and will continue to exist whether any particular person likes it or not, one of two things happen to someone who ODs. They either die or they require an ambulance ($) to take them to the emergency room where they can be revived and use up a lot of ($) equipment in the process. Think about how many tubes a person has in them when they’re on “life support”. Each of those has a cost that is likely a lot more than you’d think. Imagine that someone who hasn’t had oxygen to their brain for a decent amount of time might spend months in the hospital. Do you know how much a month in the hospital costs the province? When you factor in supplies used, nursing hours, meals, and that’s just the start of it….yeah. 

Now take the person in the above paragraph and multiply that by let’s say…300 since that’s about how many people in Sask died of an overdose so we can safely assume that the number of people who overdosed but didn’t die becusse they were taken to hospital in time is likely exponentially higher. And each of those stays is gonna cost a fuck ton.

Supervised consumption sites save the system money because they prevent people from ending up in the hospital for 1-2 months (or dying) every time they OD which for some people is multiple times a year. It’s pretty fucking simple. And anybody who is opposed to it can’t name reason that isn’t based in “they chose to be addicts so fuck em” which like is great if you live in magical conservative ideological fairytale land but the rest of us live in reality where these people exist regardless of whether you personally think they have the moral justification to exist or not. So they have to be dealt with.",t2_165uhp,Pickledicklepoo,0,1648278232.0,0,t1_i260wkx,i260wkx,False,GaryFreakingAnderson,t3_tmyppx,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/tmyppx/sask_government_again_leaves_funding_for/,Sask. government again leaves funding for supervised consumption site out of budget,/r/saskatchewan/comments/tmyppx/sask_government_again_leaves_funding_for/i260wkx/,1,r/saskatchewan,0,1

"I once worked in a small Saskatchewan factory that was constructed to create employment. Someone worked at the end of the first assembly line where the product turned a corner. That person's job was to catch the product that overshot the conveyor and put it back on the belt. When she took a break, someone else had to fill in. Eventually, they just put up a guard to stop the product from overshooting the belt. It was a big deal because they needed to employ a certain number of people to keep the Saskatchewan subsidy.

Suggesting we do something that creates more work, just for the sake of creating work, reminds me of creating jobs by taking small guard rails off equipment.

Surely it would cost less to build a solar panel factory than it would to build a nuclear power plant. Wind power would help. I see a lot of windmills south of the border. Batteries help with the peaks loads.

Saskatchewan has about 889 MW of hydroelectric capacity.

I don't believe all electricity is going to do the job, anyway. It's just easy for now. When everyone gets home at the end of the day and plugs in a car, we're going to find that our grids aren't large enough. Looking for a parking spot on a side street in Vancouver is hard enough without having to park by your charger so they are in for a surprise. Because batteries cost about $20k, used cars will be worthless unless there is a way to guarantee the remaining battery life.

Hydrogen can be transmitted down our existing natural gas lines. The future might be heating our houses with fuel cells and using the electric byproduct to feed back into the system.",t2_7ybtbm9z,Y1OG4,0,1648264052.0,0,t1_i25fqq8,i25fqq8,False,NorthernStarLord,t3_to0u3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/to0u3b/will_be_changed_very_shortly_premier_confident/,'Will be changed very shortly': Premier confident nuclear energy generation will be coming to Sask.,/r/saskatchewan/comments/to0u3b/will_be_changed_very_shortly_premier_confident/i25fqq8/,1,r/saskatchewan,0,1

"A typical large 1GW reactor produces 25-30 tonnes of high level nuclear waste per year. Source: https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities.aspx

It takes 1.13 pounds of coal to make 1kWh of electricity (source https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=667&t=6), which if my math is right is 4.5 million tonnes of coal fuel is needed per 1 GW coal plant annually. Waste products are toxic fly ash which can be used in concrete, and millions of tonnes of CO2 in the atmosphere.

So pound for pound, tonne for tonne of waste, 30 tonnes is a lot less than millions of tonnes, per ""unit"" of electricity. It's also easier to manage spent fuel you can physically handle, store, and secure, than remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

Not a call out, and I'm not suggesting there's no risk to spent fuel, but most people (including myself up until some years ago) don't comprehend the gigantic scale of coal waste, and the minuscule scale of spent fuel waste.

"As a business* I do not. Businesses of all kinds are able to expense certain things. Yup. Way of the road. Not complaining about that one bit. It’s why we vote for those policies. It makes doing business here more affordable and makes our local businesses more competitive & able to provide products to local markets for cheaper. But we still operate with millions of dollars, produce billions and our revenue is taxed & we pay in taxes much more than we ever receive in rebates. Also, most of those regions you subsidize for services are not found amongst the farming regions in the province. That’s mostly northern & more remote communities.

I don’t want your thanks.

"They'd all have to be recertified under a nuclear plant operation. There are different hazards and requirements. It's not as simple as you make it out to be. A nuclear plant also requires higher levels of knowledge and training. There's significantly fewer ""grunt work"" jobs, if you will. Meaning not enough jobs for all those people in the coal business, which has a much lower bar for entry. Entire towns rely on those coal plants to survive, that means not only will they be out of a job, with no money, no one will buy their houses. They won't be able to move somewhere else and will be stuck with their mortgages. As all the jobs revolve around coal in those towns, there won't be any jobs to be had in them.





Then you're forgetting about all the coal miners and mining operations that feed the plants. Then there's the parts and maintenance workforce that's all going to vanish. Nuclear uses different stuff.

I agree that there will be some losses in terms of rail personnel unloading coal and managing storage facilities. Again, with some training programs or some tax reliefs for affected individuals, they can get training and get a new job.

Also worth mentioning is the fact that a power plant is a huge construction project creating 300+ FTE jobs for 4 - 5 years.

">If you think you’re getting screwed over directly by the SaskParty’s governance model, you’re not one of their clients. 

This is precisely why there is so much animosity toward them in this sub. The majority of participants in this sub are not among their clients.

I may offer, then, that it's not that we're too stupid to understand why someone would vote SaskParty; it's that we know we are not the SaskParty's clients and we never will be. We do not feel we have a voice in our own Provincial Government, we do not feel we are represented, and we are growing increasingly frustrated and exasperated with what we feel is an incompetent and negligent governing style.

The SaskParty has run the province since 2007, that's *fifteen years*. How long are we supposed to wait before their pro-business environment is supposed to pay off? 15 years is nearly an entire generation.

Are we supposed to sit by and patiently wait for another 15 years to go by before we, as voters, are willing to say that what the Sask Party is doing isn't working?

This also goes beyond philosophy and into the behavior of Scott Moe himself. I think a lot of us wouldn't complain about the SaskParty so much if the leader of our Province wasn't such a colossal embarrassment on the public stage. I'm sure some feel that the insults levied at him the comments of this sub are harsh and some of the time I agree, but I think some of it is well-deserved.

Like it or not, he *is* the face of the party and therefore the Province and I have *zero* confidence in the man as a leader of *anything*. At least with Brad Wall I could understand why he led the Party and the Province, even if I disagreed with much of what he did and stood for. I could at least respect him as a *leader*. Moe does not at all seem like a competent or worthy leader of our entire Province, and that reflects on the Party itself who keeps him in his position.

I would probably have more respect for the Party if I knew people inside it were fed up with him as well and wanted to see him replaced, but they're so insular and tight-lipped there's no way we could know that even if it were true.",t2_g2zd9,monkey_sage,0,1648244427.0,0,t1_i24ag1f,i24ag1f,False,the_bryce_is_right,t3_tnw77q,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/tnw77q/sask_budget_hints_at_provincial_governments/,Sask. budget hints at provincial government's proposed carbon tax revenue strategy,/r/saskatchewan/comments/tnw77q/sask_budget_hints_at_provincial_governments/i24ag1f/,3,r/saskatchewan,0,3

"Not necessarily. Having a safe place to do drugs doesn't just mean having a clean living room you can chill out in. For example, a lot of guys working in the oil industry are addicts. I know this because I worked in the oil industry, and it varies from company to company, but if I had to put a number on it I'd say one in every three guys I worked with was addicted to an illicit substance to some degree. Some guys did blow all day every day, some guys did it on the weekends, some guys smoked crack or meth. It was so common that it just seemed normal after a while. What these guys all had in common was that they made at least $60,000/year and paid the associated taxes. They contributed to the economy, buying trucks and boats and whatever else. I can't think of any of my co-workers who were homeless, so in theory they should all have had safe places to do their drugs, right? Well probably half a dozen of them have died from overdosing or fentynal in their drugs, and a good many more were hospitalized from overdosing and fentynal. A safe injection site isn't just a sterile environment. They also check the drugs to make sure there is no fentynal or other substances in the drugs. Every dime bag tested is potentially a life saved, or, if you prefer, a dollar saved, because it's way cheaper to test for fentynal then to put somebody through the hospital system. And before you say, ""That's not my problem,"" think of anybody you know involved in oil, or the energy sector, or mining, or power line work, or any sort of high-paying manual work. It could be your brothers or your friends or your friend's kids. This is Saskatchewan, we all know somebody. But of those people that you know, I almost guarantee one out of four are struggling with addiction, and while none of them may ever plan to OD or snort a tainted line, it could easily happen to them too. Addiction isn't as simple as just saying, ""I quit."" People can barely quit smoking, or drinking coffee, never mind kicking crack. For a lot of people it takes a brush with death to turn their life around, because god knows that the ""normal"" people in their lives don't want to talk about those issues with them.

The economic philosophy behind this is that providing the environment for businesses to start, grow & be profitable if ran well, is that there will allow for more revenue to be spent on their employees as well as their business to reinvest, those reinvestments and wages will then be taxed & increase the revenue available for government, even at a lower tax rate. In turn allowing for them to spend on infrastructure, social programs, etc.. however I do like access to private schools, private healthcare, and would prefer families be given the tools/resources to provide the social care necessary for their members who may fall through the cracks & become “dependent upon the system”.. it’s a different philosophy man.

"They need to attach addiction treatment as a mandatory part of supporting these people. That’s what’s lost in all of this. Even most conservative people would likely support these sort of things if the addicts were pushed to treatment and detox. These programs lose support because a lot of people want a zero consequence, zero accountability in regards to addiction. They just want to make it more comfortable to be a junkie and “offer services” that will never be used, while allowing anti-social and self destructive behaviour to go unquestioned. Some of these people need to be forced into treatment or they’ll never get better. It’s not compassion to enable addicts, everyone knows that.

"Instead of learning anything from the Prohibition movements, both in the US and Canada, of the 1920s...We've been content to just lean back and copy their mistakes. Prohibition did not end demand and consumption of alcohol; prohibition has not ended demand and consumption of drugs. In fact, we continue to see the same problems. Prohibition of drugs has created an entire criminal element that profits off the misery that they peddle. This further drives gangs, which enhances violence against innocent and guilty alike, and lowers the standard of living for all of us in a community. 

We can talk about the ethics of drug use, we can talk about the reasons for drug use, and we can talk about the harms of drug use...But those seem to be conversations we don't want to have and instead shrug our arms and say 'drugs bad, don't do' as a general response. What has our crusade against drugs gotten us?

[2021 was a record-year with 464 confirmed and suspected overdose deaths](https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/saskatchewan-had-record-high-overdose-deaths-in-2021) in the province and a nearly four-fold increase of the 119 deaths in 2017. We're almost 4 months into 2022, and the coroner's office is already reporting a suspected 78 suspected (75) and confirmed (3) overdose deaths. A lot of this has to do with the increased levels of fentanyl being reported in drugs sold; which speaks to the dangerous nature of the supply of illicit drugs, after all, who knows what you may be buying or what it has been mixed with.

This is not a problem that only impacts users of drugs. It impacts us all in one way or another, and that's why the hands-off response to do anything of substance here should alarm us all. If you care about mental health, you have to care about drug policy. If you care about safer communities and crime, you have to care about drug policy. If you care about decreasing strains on our public health system and health spending, you have to care about drug policy. Like alcohol, all the bans in the world are not going to stop someone who is seeking to use (regardless of their reasons), and we need to put away this idea of moral superiority that we hold over those who do use drugs. 

Consumption sites are not a new idea. We license bars. We license off-sales. We have gun ranges. Hell, we don't let kids drive go-carts in the streets we make them go on a track designed for it. These are all boiled down to the same concept: There is a potential for harm, to self or others, in partaking in an activity. So, to minimize that, we say 'well, here's a safe place to go and do that then.' And right now, we are failing not just users but our communities as a whole, by ignoring the need that exists here. Drug use is happening in our communities. Our response to that shouldn't be to bring down the hammer on people, the bulk of whom have already fallen through cracks in our social system, but to do what we can to mitigate the harm to themselves and others that exists. 

Consumption sites are a stop-gap. Almost all consumption sites, that I'm aware of, include a component to help users of the site seek support for quitting drug use if they chose to seek that help. The ones who don't want it, don't have it forced on them, but it builds a relationship and support system in the future that can help them if they change their mind.

Having a place like this, sure, I'm all for helping people in crisis. But I fail to see the end to the ""vicious circle"". A place like this will not stop people from shooting up.  In a way it promotes ""hard drug use"", people can come in knowing they will be brought back from the brink of death, no harm no foul so to speak. Which most end up requiring medical care anyway. Coming from someone who lost a close family member to an OD.  This is an unpopular opinion because it's not ""politically correct"".  Reality is a bitch sometimes. 

I would give anything to have my brother back, you can try and help a determined addict all you want, getting through to them is another story.

I don’t totally disagree but even if a minimum amount of restrictions were left in place many of these deaths could be avoided. With this govt it’s always been an all or nothing decision. Cant there just be common sense approach? For example if the elderly are at risk keep masked mandates for those facilities. If kids under 5 can’t be vaccinated we need to protect them. So when the govt decided to stop testing and instead have people pay for a PCR tests many can’t afford to do the test so it now becomes a crap shoot. Do I go to work even though I’m sick and chance that I may infect others because I need to pay the rent and feed my kids? Same with kids in schools. No testing and no reporting have left parents with a difficult decision. All of this could have been avoided. I know that we all want to get on with our lives but doesn’t 33 people dying per week bother you just a little?

"about 90% of your comment has nothing to do with the topic of the taxes this industry generated.

It has not generated 15.1 billion in taxes.  That's saying what portion of GST, income tax, and corporate taxes are tied into that industry.  If you work as a cashier at a pot shop instead of McDonald's your income taxes are being lumped into.  Keep in mind a lot of that will be CPP which is ""Tax dollars"" when it's really money the government invests.

If I included all of that into the tobacco industry I beat you it would be closer to $70 billion in taxes versus the less than $4 billion for annual marijuana.

I am talking the taxes that are exclusively on marijuana products like how their are exclusive taxes for tobacco and alcohol.

"**Cannabis has added $43.5B to Canada’s economy since legalization: report**

A new report says cannabis has contributed **$43.5 billion to Canada’s gross domestic product** and $13.3 billion to Ontario’s since recreational pot was legalized in October 2018.

The report from Deloitte Canada and provincial pot distributor, the Ontario Cannabis Store, says about $25.2 billion of that contribution comes from labour income and 151,000 jobs.

The report says for every dollar in revenue or capital expenditures, the industry adds about $1.09 to Canada’s GDP and $1.02 to Ontario’s.

For every million dollars in revenue or capital expenditure, the cannabis sector sustains about four jobs in Canada and Ontario each.

The research also estimates that the industry has generated **$15.1 billion in Canadian tax revenues** and $3 billion for Ontario.

">Legalizing marijuana wasn't high on my list to do, but it's worked out and provided needed funds for governments across the country

Definitely not brought in needed funds to the government. By 2020 it only brought it in the millions. I think it generates, like $350 million only.  Cigarettes make over $8 billion.  The goverment hardly taxes marijuana which is stupid because it's insanely cheap.  I pay $1-2 per high basically. I'd gladly pay $5 per night of being high vs $20-60 in booze.

What political stability do we have for 3 years? The provincial election is before that, and most minorities governments call early elections to attempt a majority, such as doing so mid-pandemic.

They did a decent job at handling the pandemic in terms of helping the people, but financially will be seen in the future as all the printing of money they did during the pandemic is not a good thing.  Printing money faster never helps an economy long term. 

But! You got off topic at the end listing non-pandemic things.

A lot he did looks good short term, but don't forget this is a government who went into overdrive with spending and didnt do anything to generate new income.  Trudeau is doing what he needs to get elected (as do all politicians). If he actually cared for the country he would've brought GST back up to 7% (at least) and increased corporate taxes, not given them tax breaks, aid, and more during a pandemic where they did not need the aid.

"Jeremy Harrison is in way over his head on this topic. He has no idea what he’s talking about and just repeats the same talking points, which are meaningless.

Meili has challenged Moe on this pretty much every day over the past 2 weeks and gets nowhere. I can’t tell if it’s Moe is either too stupid or doesn’t care enough to do any work on this file. But this situation should be an embarrassment to his government. For a guy who pretends to be so concerned about foreign investment and attracting more money to Saskatchewan, he sure doesn’t seem to care much about Saskatchewan’s international reputation.

I guess as long has he continues to successfully gaslight voters here, that’s all that matters.

"Yes. But first you need to try Dexedrine Spansules. And if that doesn't work well enough you can apply for EDS.

I suggest if you don't already, go to a local pharmacy to have them help with the EDS forms once you've tried Dexedrine. At a local pharmacy you see the same 1 or 2 people, and they are way more helpful than like Shoppers.

I suggested asking to try Dexedrine for 1-2 weeks. If it isn't helping after 2 weeks, it probably won't. ADHD stimulant meds are much faster to figure out if it works than antidepressants.

"The pandemic has made me question my answer to this. 25 years ago, I would have said the following answer was ridiculous, but it's also an issue with the way we educate people, rather than only having the wrong people. 

In 2022, IMO, MLAs should possess at least a B.A., and previous experience in some contentious governance capacity, such as town councils, large non-profits, C-level boards, etc. A B.A. today, is effectively regarded the way a high school diploma was 20 years ago. It's a starting point.  

Ten years ago, I would have said a diploma was fine, but the world has changed. I'm not saying I think a B.A. in English from the U of R is more valuable than a 4th Class Power Engineering Diploma. 

It's because the B.A. education provided the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills, and provides an environment where young adults can question their own assumptions, and the assumptions of the world around them, in as safe of an environment as they are going to get. 

B.A. students get the luxury of having the ability to choose classes to help them understand the world and mature as an entire person in a way that the B.Sc, B.Eng, and all the solely career focused students in diploma programs (with their punishing schedules) don't have the time to do, because they are just trying to survive their timetables. 

The career focused students have such tight schedules focused on the technical aspects of their learning that they don't get time to take classes in economics and political science and psychology and criminology, and international relations and business and philosophy.  Whereas B.A. students are able to do so. This is a significant difference. 

So even though a good number of diploma graduates,  engineers and everyone with a science major most likely would have a good aptitude for economics, international relations and business - they never get the opportunity to take most of those classes.",t2_14spw9rj,Sunshinehaiku,0,1648105007.0,0,t1_i1whhrk,i1whhrk,False,GaryFreakingAnderson,t3_tld650,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/tld650/donna_harpauer_sk_minister_of_finance_who_is/,"Donna Harpauer, SK Minister of Finance - who is currently presenting the SK Budget Speech - has a Medical Technology Technologist Certificate.

"Covishield is a vaccine.  **Paxlovid is the Pfizer pill.** 

Paxlovid is an antiviral medication that helps prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading in your body. They are not used to prevent COVID-19 illness before you test positive. This treatment is only effective in the very early phase of infection.

By blocking viral replication, the medication aims to reduce the amount of virus the body has to fight. While most vaccinated people have enough immunity to fight COVID-19 infection, those that are unvaccinated or have a weaker immune system may benefit from the antiviral therapy reducing the viral load it has to overcome.

Treatment with Paxlovid must start within five days of symptom onset. The medication consists of tablets taken every 12 hours for five days.

The decision to prescribe an antiviral medication will be made by the treating clinician, based on criteria established by the product monograph and the published clinical guidance.

**Antiviral Medications Eligibility:**

Paxlovid is only recommended for adults over 18 who:

- test positive (PCR or rapid test) with mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms;
- are within five days of developing symptoms;
do not have any medical conditions that would make treatment inappropriate;
- are not taking any medications that may cause potential drug interactions; 

AND meet one of the following criteria:

-are immunocompromised, regardless of vaccine status;
-are age 55 and older, and not fully vaccinated; or
have a medical condition that puts them at high risk, and are not fully vaccinated.

If you test positive for COVID-19 on a rapid antigen test or a PCR test and believe you may meet all the criteria for COVID-19 treatment, call HealthLine 811. You will receive additional screening and be referred appropriately.

A physician or nurse practitioner will review your symptoms, eligibility, and other factors to determine whether anti-viral medication (oral medication taken at home over five days) is appropriate.

You cannot go directly to a health care provider or pharmacy to receive antiviral medication. You must be referred based on the eligibility 

Additional risk factors for those who are not fully vaccinated may include:

- Diabetes
- Body mass index greater than 30
- Chronic kidney disease with eGFR greater than 30 mL/min/1.73m2
- Congestive heart failure (NYHA class 2 or greater)
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Asthma

**People who are fully vaccinated but otherwise immunocompromised could also be eligible for COVID-19 treatment. Immunocompromised conditions include, but are not limited to:**

- People in active treatment for cancer
- Solid-organ transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients
- People with a moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency
- People taking immunosuppressive medication such as high-dose corticosteroids, biologic agents, alkylating agents and anti-metabolites

"You're getting away from the main point of this budget announcement. It's not about pay or pensions or health benefits, all of which provide teachers who are lucky enough to have permanent contracts with job security. All of the points you brought up are certainly points of contention for many people who are not in the education field. If having benefits, job security, an attractive holiday schedule, and a decent wage are so desirable, then perhaps more people should fight for the same. Or, perhaps those people should consider getting an Education degree to become a teacher themselves. I honestly don't understand why educators are repeatedly put on blast for these things - it's insane to me that other sectors wouldn't fight for these things, and that they'd rather tear teachers down for it instead.

This is about a government that clearly devalues education. They are creating issues within our schools that cannot be fixed by our amazing educators alone. As I stated earlier, classroom sizes are growing, funding is greatly decreasing, and it's Saskatchewan's children who will continue to pay for this for the rest of their lives.

"Antivirals work mostly by clogging up the reproduction mechanism, so are only effective at the very beginning of an infection. Even for something that directly attacks the virus, like a monoclonal (manufactured) antibody, someone fully vaccinated will have an immune response that suppresses or clears the virus before an antiviral could be administered.

The remaining symptoms are mostly the recovery from the effects of the virus, or the side effects of the immune response itself. Sometimes (this is true of colds and ‘flu) the virus can be gone before symptoms appear. The remaining treatments target the symptoms rather than the virus.

Finally, treatments have side effects, and it’s important not to make the situation worse by giving a treatment that’s worse than the disease, especially if their health is diminished.

"Yeah my spouse is a teacher and as much as some like to sell it as they ""don't get paid for the summer"", they are clearly paid a living annual salary. If they weren't they would be on strike as we speak.

Is their job difficult, yes it can be but it can also be pretty cushy at times. And what's the chance they get fired if they underperform? About close to zero. The profession should really be embarrassed how many poor teachers are protected within the ranks.
 
Honestly teachers have it so good in so many ways. Needless to say spouse and I are pretty appreciative of the benefits, pay, holidays, unquestioned sick time that they get.

"Can't tell you much about the Adderall thing, sorry

Vyvanse is covered if you first try a methylphenidate drug long and short acting, and then try a dextroamphetamine drug long or short acting, and if neither of those work well Vyvanse can be covered under the provincial Exception Drug Status (EDS)

For context, I tried Concerta, then generic ritalin IR, then Dexedrine Spansules (that's the long release one), and none of those worked almost at all

For some reason I didn't need to try the short acting dextroamphetamine as well. So now my Vyvanse is 80% covered under the uni plan, but idk what happens when im not in uni next fall.

"He is the leader of the party, so yes he is the primary person responsible for running it. A proper leader can improve a party by putting them in the right direction. Just look at the federal Liberals as an example - they went from 34 seats in 2011 to 184 in 2015 largely because of the support Trudeau had vs. Ignatieff (mixed with the loss of Jack Layton as a leader for the NDP and the public's degrading trust in Harper for the CPC). And they're still winning public support to this day, thought they'll eventually have to bring in new blood as well.

So despite your hopeless opinion, I do stay optimistic that there are people in the SK Party that would do better at leading than Moe. Often times in politics they just aren't visible enough due to every party's desire to not turn people against their own leader in favour of someone else. Same reason I stay optimistic that the NDP can put forth a leader that will prove to improve the party and challenge the SK Party even more than Meili has done, because whether people like the SK Party or not, they've got a very solid foothold.. and its not good to be stuck with a single ruling party forever.",t2_2c6xjgp,twistedoutlaw92,1,1648090311.0,0,t1_i1vuec4,i1vuec4,False,YALL_IGNANT,t3_tllsui,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/tllsui/federation_responds_to_202223_budget_saskatchewan/,Federation Responds to 2022-23 Budget | Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation,/r/saskatchewan/comments/tllsui/federation_responds_to_202223_budget_saskatchewan/i1vuec4/,0,r/saskatchewan,0,0

">	Killing people does matter.

Preaching to the choir. “Killing people is bad” is something that even Moe would agree with.

What you don’t seem to understand is that trying to bury someone for something that happened 25 years ago that they were already punished for, means that you think it’s okay to go after anyone for anything they ever did, including yourself.

Let’s just hope that in 10 years you never do *anything* wrong.

"I mean, that is so far from the truth it's laughable.

I understand that you're coming from a place where you likely don't have friends or family members who work in education. 

Are the holidays good? Yup - but summers are not paid and if you are on a continuing contract (very rare for beginning teachers), you don't qualify for EI. Is the pay good? Yup, if you can last long enough to make it to the highest step on the pay grid. Are you guaranteed a pension? Yup, but teachers pay handsomely into it on each paycheck and even then, it's not the gold-plated pension of the past.

Your perception is just that - your perception. Teaching is not an easy, cushy job. This isn't about a bargaining year, either. It's about deteriorating working conditions based off chronic underfunding. This is leading to larger class sizes, fewer resources for students with exceptional needs, and challenges around transportation.

"> For a government that claims to be against increasing taxes, they sure do have a good track record of doing the opposite. Recall they previously were responsible for adding PST to used car sales.

For sure - as a very tepid SK 'supporter' (I use that term loosely. I don't really like them, I just like them better than the NDP) - this is disappointing af.  They're running massive deficits constantly (at least that's improving, I suppose) - but adding PST to more and more things all the time.  They're not fiscal conservatives at all, really. They're just not as into gov't spending as the alternative. 

The other thing is, they aren't even pretending they'll remove them once things improve.  I guess I appreciate the honesty.

"I think pretty good job is overstating it.  We made it to the destination but there were plenty of missteps along the way.  

My general opinion of Trudeau as Prime Minister is he's terrible but incredibly lucky in how he does politics.  I don't mean that to criticize or endorse his political positions but rather critique how he's navigated the politics of his role.  The pandemic response shared many of the same follies as his term pre-pandemic.  And only through luck did things turn out okay.we reflect on the start of the pandemic one of the first follies was the scandal that largely took down the We charity in Canada when the charity was given an exclusive sole source contract to administer a close to $1B student grant program for the first summer of the pandemic.  It's a large amount of cash, it's very important and all the eggs are in one basket and the optics of the close association between members of the Prime Minister's family and the finance minister with the Charity did not look good.  Maybe it was a good choice, maybe not but the lack of concern or attention to optics on such a large risk was not good politics.  The result was the contract was delayed and an important program to help students through the pandemic was disrupted.

Meng Wanzhou being held in Canada at the behest of the U.S. and the two Michaels being held in China.  China was also targeting Canadian exports such as canola.  All of that should have been setting off alarms to avoid dependence on China.   When the company finally made it clear they would welch on the deal we had nothing else in place.  While Trudeau manage to get lucky and throw lots of money around hedging bets to get a place in the queues of several other companies all the priority spots at the front of the line for their production were already taken.  The government should have been hedging bets in the first place.  Not only was the Chinese bet a risk because of political tensions but it was also critically dependent on success where there was no guarantee.  https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/how-canadas-cansino-covid-19-vaccine-deal-with-china-collapsed/

Even before the pandemic the government was not maintaining the nations strategic supply of PPE and other essential medical supplies.  Yes, the government was able to eventually recover and secure steady supplies of PPE but not without a lot of money and even a lot of inferior goods.  If that's not bad enough, it doesn't seem like the government is discussing ways to prevent that from happening in the future but the CMA is: [https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/28/E810](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/28/E810) as well as many business who started up production recognizing that it's risky for the nation to be exclusively dependent on foreign production who stepped up to fill the gap either through production or procurement.  ""The market"" deserves most of the credit.

There have been lots of little mistakes and missteps but many of those can be forgiven given the circumstance such as Dr. Tam's early insistence on either medical grade PPE or nothing back when PPE was extremely difficult to find.  It took a few weeks to realize something was better than nothing when you couldn't get perfect.

I think some of the restrictions on federally regulated industries and border crossings were good early on but later on they failed on change management and communication.  A lot.  And the whole quarantine hotel scheme was a huge debacle.  It was a costly and needlessly bothersome way to solve the problem of travelers not following the rules to quarantine at home.  A problem that wasn't a particularly big problem.

There were plenty of other bumps.  To be fair, the pandemic was a serious problem that emerged suddenly requiring a rapid response.  Mistakes will happen when something is done in a hurry but a good manager will know where mistakes matter and where they don't.  I don't feel Trudeau's handling of the pandemic took the time to really think though what they did.  The government jumped head first all in on everything, sometimes they made a splash and sometimes they made a concussion.
