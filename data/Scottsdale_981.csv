"As someone in a similar situation for years now, the best thing you can do is report, report, report. It’s going to suck regardless, best to get it on file with the City, Code Enforcement & PD so there is a consistent record of the issues at the home to help the push for legislation, especially if we can’t afford to sue. 

First: Check Scottsdale’s rental map to make sure the home is registered at https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/codes/vacation-short-term-rentals & if not report to Code asap & they will get on them

Then: You can check construction permits & report unpermitted construction which occurs at these homes regularly. You can also report the home being used as an events center or sleeping more than 10 people,  which many of these homes do, to Code. Don’t hesitate to call police on the nuisance homes. Scottsdale noise ordinance starts at 10pm, but if it’s excessively loud or inappropriate (gangs/cursing/nudity) you can call whenever. They have defined a specific process to deal with them & the renters have paid to party so they’re not likely to be receptive to feedback. & Again, when you go to PD there will be a record of consistent nuisance behavior at the home, vs trying to go to a property manager or AirBNB who are making money on that party, not the neighbors. 
Don’t be shy about sending videos or photos of nuisance behavior to the local representatives, City council, the news etc.


I’m sorry you are in this situation too. It sucks, I feel like we’d be more secure in a 7/11 parking lot but if they’re going to make it a shithole, I’m not unpaid security working for THEM.

I don’t understand why these short term rentals even want party people like this renting their property.

"Those who think this guy sounds like a dick clearly don’t live near a short term rental. We have the exact same problems except we’re in our early 30’s. 

What people don’t realize is the impact short term rentals have on single family home inventory and prices, particularly in Scottsdale, and pricing out the American dream of home ownership for what used to be working class communities. I know young people who own 10+ airbnbs in Phoenix that they bought with mom and dads money initially and play golf every day. That doesn’t even consider the massive REIT’s that do the same thing at the institutional level. It is NOT a healthy trend for a city to have a meaningful percentage of homes that are only filled with vacationers on weekends in cool seasons. In the land of low density, Scottsdale will not experience healthy growth and maintenance if our communities evolve like this. Schools, roads, facilities and amenities will all suffer.

That’s the economic side of things, and then there’s quality of life. Last week it was literally 10 cars parked at the house blocking the cul-de-sac and our driveway. The week before it was someone playing basketball late at night on the court they built right next to our window to attract renters. The week before it was loud music and girls screaming at their pool at midnight on a Wednesday. We want to have a baby soon, and there’s multiple causes for concern with strangers who don’t give a fuck about my family there every weekend.

It’s not cool, and I hope this guy wins his case. I hope Scottsdale will do something about it, and Airbnb will be forced to as well.

My 2 cents: I’d get there around lunch time at the latest and maybe even look into buying a table if there’s a handful of friends willing to split it. Then you have a spot to sit, keep your belongings, and hide under an umbrella when it’s 110° out.

DM them on instagram if you have a date in mind and i’m sure they’ll answer you.

"Yes get a table with that many guys. I’m not a big table guy but with a group of 9 you’ll probably be miserable without it. Basically all the clubs in Scottsdale are right next to each other. If you are club hopping you can typically bribe the bouncer to get in. I’ve never had trouble bribing a bouncer but I’ve always been in mixed groups not a 9 guy sausage fest. Your odds will be a lot better if you grab a couple pretty girls out of the line and say hey do you want to try and get in with us.

Sumo maya is a supper club with awesome food.

C2 tactical is a shooting range in north scottsdale where you can rent guns and get instruction. I highly recommend booking a group class with an instructor if some of your group is new to shooting. 

As for non club bars everything will be packed and basically everywhere will have pretty women. I live in old town and just going to a bar/restaurant on a Weekday everywhere is bumping because it’s tourist season here.

 don’t drive drunk under any circumstances. Arizona had some of the harshest DUI rules including mandatory jail time and I doubt any of your buddies want to fly back to AZ in a few months to serve a short stint in jail.  There are taxi golf carts zipping around old town constantly in addition to ubers.

">Like 95% of bars and restaurants are pet free. Just avoid pet friendly establishments if it bothers you. 

Sadly that is not true anymore. I avoid dog friendly places.  I was just on a walk and saw this.  I wasn't eating anything.  I saw this and found it disgusting.

This is a health code violation.  Staff should be trained not to do this.   I appreciate how Phoenix Brewing Co handles it.  They have signs everywhere saying employees can't touch the dogs and outline the rules for being dog friendly.  More places should be like that.

"Scottsdale will be fine if you're just trying to get an idea of what the Sonoran Desert is like. Your post is kinda vague, but I'm assuming you're okay with hiking. Scottsdale has the [McDowell Sonoran Preserve](https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/preserve) and it's a great place to check out the desert up close in person. There is a north and south section. Use the Browns Ranch trailhead of the north section for a great hiking area and lots of flora without needing to do too much elevation (I find the Pima Dynamite Trailhead has more bikers which can annoy some folks). Grab a paper map at the trailhead, it can be a maze and most trail apps don't navigate the area well. Use the Gateway Trailhead of the south section if you want to hike with the opportunity for a lot of elevation, there's a very short walking path with informational signs about the desert if you don't want to hike too far (use Tom's Thumb Trailhead of the south section if you want a very steep trail to the top that is a 4.5 mile round trip).

It will be fucking hot, start as early in the day as possible. Be hydrated 12 hours before you go. Bring at least a liter or two of water with you. Wear sun protection, there is practically no shade. Know your fitness level and assume you'll get tired quicker than you do at home due to the heat, dryness, and sun exposure. Heat exhaustion will potentially effect you for days, ruining your trip. Heat stroke will potentially kill you, ruining your life.

"I’ve seen people let their dog swim in the salt river, which BLOWS my mind because the current is so strong I feel like any moment the dog can be swept away.

Just this week I was at saguaro lake and someone had their dog off leash in a private cove area. We are always reluctant to do this because we have heard of problems with the algae … and technically it’s not allowed either. The dog we saw was not obedient either, she ran up the cliff to see us when we hiked by. Hellooooo, snakes??!! 

We used to take our dog to always unleashed to swim in the summer, but I strongly advise against supporting this establishment. My dog “attacked” another dog while he was there, however the owners refused to release any video footage for us to assess the situation. (I work in the field of behavior, so it was important for me to identify the antecedent to what may have triggered my dog so that I can work with him on his reactivity. He is a rescue.)

"Do some research on what exactly you want to experience. The Sonoran Desert is vast, takes a lifetime to really take it in. It's hard for me to picture it from the eyes of a tourist. Personally if seeing desert landscapes was my goal I'd try to stay somewhere further South, more Tucson-ish. Or if coming from Scottsdale/East Valley I'm pretty sure I would head for the Superstitions. Really though, I'd skip all that and go North instead, like the less touristy parts of the GC or Navajo Monument or something. For a short trip I might consider Sedona.

Scottsdale is a pretty convenient base for checking out Phoenix and the interesting parts of the state that lie East and South, but it's also a little too urban for what you might have in mind.

Salt River Project election to draw thousands of voters to choose water, power leaders

All of this   
will get decided by about 13,000 people who have requested ballots.   
March 25 is the deadline to get a ballot. In 2020's SRP election, about   
6,000 individuals voted. Election day this year is April 5. ...

PIRG, a   
consumer group focused on health, safety and financial stability issues,  
 does not advocate for particular candidates in SRP elections, but does   
offer the utility feedback on a variety of issues, from power plant   
developments to customer rate plans and payment policies.

""Unfortunately, SRP’s arcane   
voting system automatically deems renters ineligible to vote and also   
contributes to a miniscule percentage of ratepayers that vote for SRP   
leadership,"" Brown said. ""Eligible SRP customers should exercise their   
right to vote in the SRP elections to help determine the direction of   
their multi-billion dollar utility when it comes to their   
electric bills, water and energy infrastructure, and related policies.""

SRP  
 races are notoriously difficult for outsiders to win because of the   
acreage-based voting system and the tradition of large land owners   
voting for people with ties to agriculture, often coming from families   
with ties to the formation of SRP.....

In years past, most   
incumbents on the board would not spend more than $500 on their races,   
according to finance reports filed with Maricopa County.

Four years ago a political action group from Chispa, which is affiliated with the League of Conservation Voters, even spent $100,000  
 to help its preferred candidates, which is a pittance for most   
elections but enough to make a material difference in SRP races. This   
year Sierra Club is endorsing the team of renewable-energy advocates   
seeking office.

Voters can request a ballot and find further details of the election over the phone at 602-236-3048 and online at www.srpnet.com/elections.  
 The website also includes a form to be included on the early-voter   
list. The deadline to request a ballot is 5 p.m. on Friday, March 25.   
Election day is April 5. 

The  
 power district has 14 board members. The first 10 are the same areas as  
 the water association, while the additional four are ""at-large"" members  
 who represent the entire territory. The at-large members were added in   
the 1970s following criticism of the acreage-based voting, and they are   
elected on a one-vote-per-person basis, not acreage.

The solar advocates that have won seats so far represent these four   
at-large seats, though this year members of the ""clean energy"" team are   
gunning for acreage-based seats and endorsing challengers for the   
offices of president and vice president.",t2_ojyib,FTGremlin,0,1648093290.0,0,t1_i1w05yw,i1w05yw,True,vanderlinden,t3_thh12j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/thh12j/srp_election/,SRP election,/r/Scottsdale/comments/thh12j/srp_election/i1w05yw/,1,r/Scottsdale,0,1

"Unfortunately, an emphasis on local ingredients won't guarantee the absence of shellfish. There are shrimp farms in Arizona, and wild shrimp are routinely caught in the waters of the Gulf of California in the neighboring Mexican state of Sonora, so even many restaurants with a local angle serve shrimp.

My best guess is that you might be able to reach out to a restaurant like [FnB](http://www.fnbrestaurant.com/) and ask if they are currently serving any shrimp on their seasonal menu.

"Well, technically, it's illegal to have alcohol on the reservation (which is where Salt River Fields is, for those who don't know) and this limits your options.

You can bbq at a park that's located in the north-west corner of the intersection of Pima road and McDonald drive -- they even have some standing grills there. You might need a permit from the city to drink beer at the park, though -- I'm not sure.  But, off the top of my head, that's about the closest location I can think of, to Salt River Fields (SRF), where you might be able to actually tailgate. Any open area around the SRF, east of Pima road is reservation land, so it wouldn't work. And, most land west of Pima road is hardscape: residential or commercial real estate. I suppose, if you knew somebody who owned an office building, or perhaps just had an office that was west of Pima road, you might be able to make arrangements to tailgate in the parking lot of an office building there. But, again, I think you'd probably need a permit from the city to drink legally there. Scottsdale seems to be pretty picky when it comes to stuff like that. In any case, I wish you the BEST of LUCK!

"About 20 years i went to college in England; a classmate found out i was from the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, he told me it was way too hot when he visited here to hike.

Me: well you shouldn’t have hiked in the summer!

Him: but i visited in January!!


Conclusion: if you find it too warm when you get here, please dont hike lol!!

HYDRATE. For the love of God HYDRATE, even if you’re not doing anything strenuous. Our dry air is great but it sucks up moisture.

SUNSCREEN. We have lots of sunshine. I came back from England white as ghost (i still have pictures to prove it) and i spent a lot of time outdoors. Im of Mexican descent so it took a lot to get me that white! If you got light skin, you need it. And wear a hat since you’re a ginger!   You might want to bring one lightweight long sleeved shirt for the days too.

Make sure you don’t lose your wallet or cell phone. People are nicer in Scottsdale (we called it Snottsdale growing up) but while sometimes lost cell phones and wallets are turned into the police, most dont. Downtown Scottsdale is obviously a HUGE party area, so it comes with all the associated awesomeness and problems. So use common sense!

I dont know what party life is like anymore, but if you want a local hangover cure, you might brave menudo (the mexican american cure: it’s a stew made of hominy and cow stomach. I love it and my many relatives swear by it for hangovers. But it scares most people who have never had it). 

Indian tacos are delicious in general (Indian as in native american, thanks so much for the confusion Columbus).  They are either beans and/or meat in a frybread shell and topped like a regular taco. I think they are heavy enough to sop up alcohol! 

The Sugar Bowl in downtown Scottsdale is a ice cream parlor that hasn’t changed it’s menu since like the 60s. It’s adorable. You might find The Cornish Pasty company amusing: it’s run by some people from Cornwall and the only true pub i found outside England. They have 1 in downtown Scottsdale now. 

If you’re a nerd like me, you can visit the many museums we have, we have a botanical garden in Phoenix. There’s a Japanese friendship garden somewhere in Phoenix. 

Goldfield Ghost town out by the superstitions mountains is fun if you want a silly take on the wild west.

Also, you’re coming when the desert is starting to bloom. I highly recommend visiting the nature a little out of the city to see the lush desert when it’s relatively green with flowers.

Craft 64: good pizza, great beer selection

Coach house: just a good bar

Blanco tacos: good sit tacos at a restaurant

Mr Mesquite: good takeaway tacos after a night of drinking

Snakes and lattes: not in Scottsdale, but fun board ge bar

Things to do during the day, depending on the exact month:

The desert botanical gardens are incredible

Top golf is always fun

Lots of good hikes around town(but don't do echo canyon without at least 1.5L of water regardless of time of year)

">is this going to be a wasted trip due to the heat

Right now it's absolutely **beautiful** weather. I wouldn't worry about heat until it starts going 100+.

"Everyone here has given some great feedback!
We have amazing eats, outdoors activities, and everything else they’ve said. 
$500k will not get you anything move-in ready in Scottsdale. Unless you want a condo. Have some off market homes that need fixing that would make great airbnbs on the Tempe/Scottsdale border. 
If your goal is to be close to nice restaurants, some night life, the outdoors, and within 40min of the airport, we have so many cities for you. 
One of the best parts of AZ is the accessibility to other cities/the airport. I could live in East Gilbert close to the San Tan Village Mall and still make it to central Phoenix in 40min, airport in 20-30 depending on traffic. 
As for short term rental markets, Scottsdale is the cream of the crop of course, but don’t sleep on other areas. We have clients with successful short term rentals in all cities, just depends on your property type and target demographic. And of course what kind of deal you could get on it. 
I recommend for sure keeping Scottsdale in the mix, but expand your options to Tempe, Chandler (inside the 101), Gilbert, and parts of Phoenix (uptown, Melrose, biltmore, Arcadia, even the Phoenix side of Paradise Valley Mall has been exploding). All of these markets can do you well if you buy right.

"Your happiness needs/lifestyle requirements are a great fit for the Scottsdale area. Like others on here, I’d recommend checking out old town and specifically areas around the Greenbelt. It’s basically a 15 mile stretch of public parks, golf courses, and green spaces connected together with amazing walkable paths along the entire stretch.

The best Dog Park I’ve ever been to, [chaparral](htpps://goo.gl/maps/okLbYQ6AVR6eThBJA) Dog Park, is 1 mile north of old town along the Greenbelt. I have two dogs and my GF has one and I take all three there every day. That alone feels like a mini vacation daily, and walking there and back will get your steps in.

In my experience, the further you go away from old town, walkability drops off rapidly. Phoenix area outside of Scottsdale is primarily a car town with very busy roads and some places without sidewalks at all.

I’d also recommend coming here and visiting before making a decision on where you want to be. Starting out you could rent to get a feel for the place before buying. Unfortunately, the longer you wait to purchase, the higher the price you’ll be paying because things in the Scottsdale area just keep rising.  I bought my home in August 2021, and (according to Zillow) it’s already appreciated 100K. D.M. me if you have other questions, I’ve had family who lived in SLC, and I’ve been in the Scottsdale area for three years now, transplanted from the bay area.

Good luck!

"Ok I’m thinking this means Old Town - if I’m wrong let me know.

Going North of Old Town gets you into Gainey Ranch and long time established upscale neighborhoods. The condos/apartments built at Lincoln and Scottsdale are maybe 3 or 4 years old so check those out.

If you go south into Tempe, they have been building new apts and condos for the last 10 years straight so you should have quite the pick.

I would go to Goog Maps, center on old town. Zoom out like 2 miles and type “apartment” and find the top 5 with little to no reviews, those are probably your newest builds to check out first.

There is some really high end condo buildings down across from Fashion Square mall down there, Optimum, like $800k base entry if that is more what you are looking for.

EDIT: omg so I did this and there are like 30 apartment complexes to chose from down there. This one had almost no reviews so maybe pretty new - https://bmsiaz.com/apartments/vista-montana-apartments/

"Ok so Phoenix in general you can be very out doorsy, BUT you gotta watch that heat in summer and walking dogs on pavement or sidewalks or event desert trail, you need to put shoes on them or they will burn their pads. Most people do early morning routines before the sun wakes up in earnest. Also water, if they are huskies or something with a down under coat you need to BRUSH them and thin that fur out.

Gym, no problem. EOS for nice, simple budget. Mountain, Lifetime for $200/mo premium experience.

Dancing like clubs, old town Scottsdale and Tempe around ASU - fortunately not that far apart and in decent areas so you can setup home near by. I’m sure there are clubs down town also,  it I’ve never visited.

Concerts, sporting, plays, comedy clubs, bars and clubs - got you covered, it’s really sounding like landing somewhere near Old Town Scottsdale (it’s the southern tip of Scottsdale right above Tempe) is going to match well with what you want.

Food? Ummm YEA, we like eating. All over Scottsdale, Arcadia and Tempe are range of $ to $$$$ to pick from.

NOTE - the only thing in your “good day” is all the porch time… July, August and Sept it’s like 108-116 degrees outside. It will feel like sitting inside of a hair dryer unless you have a nicer mister and fan setup - you might also be sweating from humidity if the summer rains are coming in hard.

"You are moving to a great location - super easy to get north to Sedona/Flagstaff (Pinetop is fine too, just go far out East to end of Shea) when weather is hot.

You are next to 2 great ""mall"" type areas, Deserty Ridge itself of course and then Scottsdale 101 a few miles down the 101.

If you come down Tatum and cut over to Scottsdale Rd just north of Thunderbird, you have Kierland (West side of Scottsdale Rd) and Scottsdale Quarter (East side of Scottsdale Rd) for high end eating, retail, Apple store, all that jazz.

Getting downtown for shows is maybe 20-25 mins, go West to 51, then straight into downtown. Easy Peazy

You chose a great location.

EDIT: The gentleman below that posted about how HOW THE CARS get and ALLERGIES was spot on. If you buy any car color other than white and don't tint the windows to legal limit, get ready to melt.

Also, he wasn't kidding, leaving your phone in the car, anything important, and then parking the car in the sun in the middle of summer actually runs a pretty good chance of melting or damaging the item.

We've also had two Teslas and they don't cool enough to keep the car comfortable while traveling in full Arizona summer heat. That sun penetrates the glass roof like you can't believe. It's very obvious that car was built in Southern California.

The allergies are something that continues to surprise me even though I grew up here, but it appears to be the result of everyone planting trees that never should have lived here from the 1960s to the current day.

"Everything you need is very close to you!

Enjoy it’s a solid place to live!

You have good highway access.

One thing to be aware is many group sports take place closer to Tempe, which is just 30 minutes away.

Scottsdale quarter is expensive but good for date night. Get a fry’s card/grocery store memberships for gas prices.

Whether you want plants, art shows, golf, bookstores, you name it- right there!  

IKEA is 50 mins away btw.

Desert ridge is mostly teenagers and 40+. There’s a copy in Tempe if you want a more young adult crowd. There’s several major high schools close. 

Lots of good food. Indian food at bell road/Tatum, Krui Thai, mountainside fitness is next door-or go to Esporta-small gyms available also. Lifetime fitness location is top tier as well.

Tj’s pizza, barrows pizza
Filiberto’s 
Trader Joe’s.  


Personally desert ridge restaurants are a bit expensive, you can also walk the Reach, go to the MIM. 

Hockey/nfl is 45 mins out. Baseball 35ish. 
Mint has the best deals imo for dispensaries, maybe they will fall off, idk 2-1 stuff every week. 

For people butching about traffic- construction seems done so it should improve- finally can speed more. Cops are lenient with speeders here btw, I go 75-80 all the time. 

Desert ridge traffic is really not that bad. The entrances are limited but you will figure it out pretty quick. Barrio queen is godly Mexican food.

"Desert Ridge is where I grew up. It's a nice area, not as crazy upscale as parts of Scottsdale. More middle class families and young professionals. But it's still an awesome community with plenty of amenities. We definitely miss it since the entire family moved back east. 

It's nice having the hotel and golf course there. Get a bike because there are fantastic bike paths and really great sidewalks that make pedaling down to Desert Ridge shopping center easy (don't do this in summer unless it's early morning though). Pretty much everything you need is there or nearby. Desert Ridge complex also has nice little events and there's areas to congregate at like boccie courts, a splashpad, a big fireplace. They bring in musicians, art showcases, etc. It's not a terrible drive to get downtown for events from the area compared to other cities either. The 101 and 51 is right there too which is so convenient. Traffic backs up a little down by the shopping complex but you lived in VA anywhere near the beltway Phoenix traffic is child's play. 

For daily functioning the biggest thing you need to do is get sunscreens for your cars windows (completely blackout ones, not just the tinted shaded ones). Tinting the windows helps too. Always be sure to have water in your vehicles as well in case of break downs. 

If you have any kind of outdoor space of your own and are planning on using it in summer get some fans and consider a misting system. 

If you have pets, make sure you monitor their hydration too. 

Oh and get ready to eat In-N-Out burger regularly for about the first 6 months you're there once you discover it.",t2_csrqjtan,neonstarseed,0,1647838247.0,0,t1_i1hu1ba,i1hu1ba,True,lileggroll129,t3_tivjph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tivjph/moving_to_desert_ridge/,Moving to Desert Ridge,/r/Scottsdale/comments/tivjph/moving_to_desert_ridge/i1hu1ba/,1,r/Scottsdale,0,1
"Welcome to Phoenix! Everyone mostly covered the important stuff.

You are officially in North Phoenix and bordering North Scottsdale. The Desert Ridge area is wonderful and you've heard the worst regarding some traffic congestion, in particular Tatum Rd.

The Desert Ridge area does have everything you need from grocery (Albertsons), big box (Target), entertainment (Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble, Comedy Club, Copper Blues Live), some very good food spots from sit down to fast food (In n Out, Chipotle, Flower child, Barrio Queen, Thirsty Lion, Hulas, Ocean Prime). There aren't many specific bars, but Copper Blues and Whining Pig.

Nearby (5-10 miles) you have a few other options. 

- Groceries (Fry's Foods, Sprouts Farmers Market, Safeway)

What does being in North Phoenix mean for you?  Well, you're not in the heart of downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale. You're in the burbs im North Phoenix where you have some great ways out of town up North, and really good access to the rest of the valley. 

Old Town Scottsdale (Peak nightlife and high end restaurants, hotels, and shopping) - 25 mins

Downtown Phoenix (Suns/Diamondbacks stadiums, growing development with good restaurants, trendy events and experiences) - 30 mins

East Valley (Chandler, Mesa, Gilbert which have some similar areas to Desert Ridge) - 40-60 mins

West Valley (Cardinals/Coyotes stadiums, Casino, Westgate bars/restaurants) - 30 mins

Outdoors Lake/Rivers (Lake Pleasant, Lake Bartlett, Salt River which have kayaking, tubing, boating, fishing, etc) - 60 mins

Northern Arizona (Prescott, Cottonwood, Sedona, Flagstaff, Payson are all great northern Arizona cities/towns with awesome outdoors, cool weather, beautiful pine trees, wineries, breweries, etc) - 1-2 hours

Some ""hidden"" gems in the northern Phoenix area (just my opinion):

 - The Thumb BBQ - Amazing BBQ pit of a gas station/car wash

- The Whining Pig - Craft beer bar that has a ""hidden"" speakeasy attached back by the bathrooms for fancy cocktails

- Gin N Reel - Speakeasy hidden in the back of Stir Coffee Bar on High Street (right next to Desert Ridge) where the wall behind the pay phone opens for a 25-30 person secret bar with fancy cocktails

- Tikka Shack - Fast casual Indian spot that's fantastic, especially if you're unfamiliar with Indian food and want a nice easing into it, right at Desert Ridge

- Pork on a Fork BBQ - Hole in the wall BBQ in an industrial complex about 15 minutes west of Desert Ridge

- Escape Room 101 - A nice variety of escape rooms to mix it up and do something a little different

- Carefree/Cave Creek - Little town about 20 minutes north with craft shops, saloons, bull riding bars, and fun places to walk around, drink, or do some country dancing",t2_ck98dzw,PhxJeff,0,1647837055.0,0,t1_i1hs4ls,i1hs4ls,True,lileggroll129,t3_tivjph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tivjph/moving_to_desert_ridge/,Moving to Desert Ridge,/r/Scottsdale/comments/tivjph/moving_to_desert_ridge/i1hs4ls/,4,r/Scottsdale,0,4

For women, cloth seats or cloth seat covers are helpful. Burning the back of your thighs is…not fun.

If you have a dog, they can burn their feet on the asphalt and sidewalk. You need shoes at the pool. Just to walk to the pool stairs can hurt your feet. Learn about the Jumping Cholla.

"Hi. Welcome. I live close by. I like Albertsons for groceries or even target but Albertsons can be expensive. Fry’s on 14th st and bell (somewhere near there) is amazing. Best supermarket but a bit far. 
There’s a dispensary on cave creek and rose garden that is ok but again expensive. Probably can find cheaper further into town. 
Restaurants at desert ridge are ok. Not sure I have a favorite to recommend, they are all just ok. 
My best advice for living in Phoenix is to drink a lot of water when you get here for a few weeks. It takes a bit for your body to acclimate to the dry weather but it will after a while. Now the summer, that just sucks nothing to do about that. 
A lot of people like minted dental for a dentist and there is an internal medicine practice and urgent care across from desert ridge on the west side of Tatum.

"Lots of good recommendations so far.

For dining out and nightlife, there are some good spots in Desert Ridge like Barrio Queen and Yard House. To add to that, if you head a mile east, you've got City North (High Street) where you'll find more upscale options and a comedy club. My girlfriend and I visit that area a couple of times a month. Check out Moden Margarita or Humble Bistro and then pop into Blue Martini for the late-night crowd and great people watching.

As for Valley Fever, I wouldn't concern yourself with that. Be aware of it, but don't fret. I've been here for over a decade, know lots of people and have not met anyone who's ever contracted it and have only heard a story or two about anyone who has.

For real, don't leave anything in your car during the summer and get a windshield screen for when it's parked. Hot leather seats and steering wheels suck.

There is also a big car show at Westworld this weekend, so you might miss it.

There are also more car shows on the calendar.

If you do a Google search for ""Scottsdale car shows"" there are a few nearby car shows in Phoenix and Queen Creek next weekend.

To each their own, and if you change your mind, consult a doctor first. This will happen anywhere you live, where you body wasn't trained and adapted to the local allergens.

"Ah, I do not consume bee products. However, I found that immunotherapy (via allergy shots) has really helped me. When I moved to Scottsdale. Going outside I'd get covered in hives, got bad eczema and generally unpleasant times. Where I lived before, I would still get bad eczema, and my nose would be sneezing for days but never full body hives. But now that I've started immunotherapy, changed my diet, and started at home injections. It's been really manageable.

Honestly in the past I’ve had the best luck with Craigslist because it’s where most single property landlords post and dealing with a small landlord is the absolute best and you usually get more bang for your buck. It’s time intensive in your end because you need to constantly check as they won’t stay up long. The second you introduce a property management company the rent goes up so they can get their cut and they’re likely setting up group showings with a ton of other renters so they can create pressure to sign and only do one showing.,t2_1l5fizpd,defaultusername4,0,1647525950.0,0,t1_i10pxfh,i10pxfh,True,Entire_Entry4178,t3_tg1b41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tg1b41/rental_resources/,Rental Resources,/r/Scottsdale/comments/tg1b41/rental_resources/i10pxfh/,3,r/Scottsdale,0,3

Buy locally sourced honey, add it to your daily diet. Unless you have some really severe allergy issues the problems will go away after some months, other than maybe that really bad day or couple a year. Or talk to your doctor about local bee pollen therapy.

"> this website does a great job explaining an amazing way to get into aviation!

Do you mean your website, the same one as your username? I appreciate the sentiment of wanting to get others into aviation and spread the passion and hobby (albeit not the shameless self plug), but becoming a ground instructor will just run you multiple hundreds of dollars in written exams with little to no use, this doesn't teach you how to fly an airplane let alone qualify you to teach how to fly them, and really is not a great way to get *into* aviation. You'd be very hard pressed to find any employment doing this as well, most people will just go to a school or find an actual certified flight instructor. 

 If you want to get into becoming a pilot or aviation then take a discovery flight at one of the many flight schools around here or perhaps for a more affordable option get into drones and get your small unmanned aircraft systems license.",t2_nmtx5,Trondiver247,0,1647317712.0,0,t1_i0pkwer,i0pkwer,True,LetsTalkAviation,t3_te7bmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/te7bmz/want_something_different_to_do_in_scottsdale/,"Want something ""different"" to do in Scottsdale?

">On the other hand, the neighborhoods of Scottsdale, Chandler, and Gilbert are just comical. Do the authors want people in Old Town Scottsdale or Kierland?

I don't know if you're joking or not but Scottsdale and Gilbert in my experience are not bad at all.

You'll pay a bit more in Scottsdale to live there but all things considered it is one of the nicer places to live in the valley. Even then, you can find relatively affordable and nice apartments in Scottsdale once you start looking outside of the obviously popular and overpriced Old Town and Arcadia areas. All in all, Scottsdale gets a bad rep and I don't see why. Unless you're basing your opinion solely on the Old Town and ""I lease a Mercedes and go to Maya every weekend"" personalities.

I don't have experience living in Gilbert, but I've visited friends quite often and we go out to eat down there. I see no problems with Gilbert, yet I guess. I'm starting a job in Gilbert soon and might be looking at relocating closer there so maybe this point will change.

The real shocker to me is Tempe being at #9. Has anyone been to Tempe recently? I went to college and lived there afterwards for a short time. I still go back from time to time to visit, eat, shop, etc. Recently there are more homeless and addicts in Tempe than I've ever seen before. I don't mean this in a derogatory way, but it certainly detracts from being a ""best neighborhood"" in my opinion. The homes in Tempe are either brand new or on their last legs as some relic from the 60s - 70s, so that's a total crapshoot. Mill ave no longer has any of the iconic spots. The only pro to living in Tempe, in my opinion at least, is the festivals they throw on Mill ave, but you could just live in Scottsdale or a surrounding city and drive to Tempe for that.

I wish Fountain Hills was higher, but they have almost nothing to do / eat / shop /etc there so what's the point living even further than Scottsdale.",t2_5srus,DeckardPain,0,1647308368.0,0,t1_i0p1f24,i0p1f24,False,RJHamster,t3_te5nwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/te5nwv/best_phoenix_area_neighborhoods_to_live_in_2022/,Best Phoenix Area Neighborhoods To Live In 2022: Niche Report,/r/Scottsdale/comments/te5nwv/best_phoenix_area_neighborhoods_to_live_in_2022/i0p1f24/,2,r/Scottsdale,0,2

"I moved here last year and looked at the Niche website -- it's a flawed system at its core. Scores are based exclusively on user review, so ratings are subject to incredible bias.

Despite that, Phoenix gets broken up into neighborhoods, but those often don't make sense either: Niche gave me the impression that Ahwatukee is a local utopia, but in reality a lot of Ahwatukee is just like the other not-so-great parts of Phoenix.

"The time of year matters as much as time of day.

Rattlesnakes start moving above ground more as temps warm up in the spring.  They are very dependent on external sources to maintain body heat and they love 80-90 degree temps.

On my hundreds of hikes on Maricopa county trails, I’ve seen:

One Tarantula, A pack of 10 Javalina, 1 Gila Monster, 4 deer, 0 scorpions, 3 Coyotes, 2 bobcats, and countless Rattlesnakes and Roadrunners.

In other words, consider yourself fortunate if you spot any wildlife beyond a few small spiders, small lizards and lots of birds species.

My advice:  DON’T venture off the trails.  Rattlesnakes really hate being stepped on, and you’ll hate the hospital bill after stepping on one.",t2_15w8ru,mrk68,0,1647200414.0,0,t1_i0j0usb,i0j0usb,True,ilikenick,t3_tdbv2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/tdbv2g/trails_with_lots_of_wildlife/,Trails with lots of wildlife,/r/Scottsdale/comments/tdbv2g/trails_with_lots_of_wildlife/i0j0usb/,10,r/Scottsdale,0,10

You do not need an attorney to file an order of protection. It’s a simple form online you can fill out and file at the court house. Once your EX is served the order goes into effect and then a court date gets set. 99% of the time they are upheld because the courts are lazy and just want to cover their asses.

"Having lived in both places, currently in old town, I would say some of the answers would depend on your perspective. If you're in cap hill or west Seattle or midtown ish, then you'll love it here. If you're from the east side, North Scottsdale is a better fit. If you're Burien, Everett or any other outlier then you'll have to catch up a little but will in time. To answer your questions...
1. South /old town or Tempe closer to asu depending on your budget. If old town there are a bunch of new big apt projects along Scottsdale rd and McDowell rd 
2. Seattle is the coolest town in the country, to me, but people here are generally cool as well. You'll have no problem 
3. Lots of good and douchey choices for clubs in old town but a ton of great restaurants. Check out Fnb. Would also recommend downtown phx 
4. Nothing like Seattle. 
5. Bad but you'll get used to the low 100s and find ways to cope with the 110s like getaways to Flag or Diego or buying a kiddie pool and a big cooler 
6. Yes. Your exposure to scorpions will depend on where exactly you live. More snake sightings in North Scottsdale. I've been stung four times. Hurts like a bitch but you'll survive 
7. It's big here. Better to do a little research and hit the lighter traveled trails instead of being with a thousand people on camelback. Also, Do Not hike in the heat. You will underestimate your ability and be another one of ""those"" people that have to get rescued. No joke, there's about one of those a day in the summer 
8. Why, yes...yes it is. 
9. The early morning will work. In the summer 6pm will still be hot and the pavement will be brutal for her paws

"The Valley is so massively huge and so is the style of living and price points.   I wouldn't know where to begin without knowing your life style and budget.   Based on 20 something I would suggest Old Town Scottsdale area, Tempe or downtown Phoenix.   I would find out where you work and try to limit your commute.

Btw - I did this exact same thing in '01 when I moved from Ballard, WA to Scottsdale (a 2500' house near 100th St and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd).   The lifestyle here is very different and I love it.   

Northern Scottsdale is great for Mtn Biking which I was located 1 mile from the Lost Dog Trail system in the McDowell Mtns.   This area is probably best for families IMO.

 I also have lived in Litchfield Park (far westside) which was cool EXCEPT it is a remote area surrounded by places that I wouldn't want to hang out at, and was no where near my work.   Would NOT live there again.   But if you had a job at Amazon or similar it might make sense.

I also lived in a historic home in downtown Phoenix (La Hacienda district, near 7th St and Thomas).   I loved that when I was there, but I no longer desire to live in and put up with downtown phoenix living.   Would not live there again unless traffic and downtown was cleaned up.  I'm twice as old as you and my lifestyle is primarily around hiking, mountainbiking, and restaurants.

I now live in near 44th St and Camelback which I am very happy with - great restaurants, happy hours, shopping, hiking Camelback Mtn and the Phx Preserve.   It is the highest of all those price points.  

You will be prepared for your first summer....but after 20 years I have NEVER gotten used to summers.   Now I build my vacation plan around getting OUT of the Valley as much as possible between June - Sept.   I spent alot of weekends in Sedona or Payson areas.

"Hash Kitchen. I’ve eaten breakfast all over The Valley of The Sun as well as Las Vegas. Hash Kitchen is hands down one of the best breakfast food places. There is a party vibe, much like places in Vegas. But even if you aren’t into having a DJ spin top 40 while you eat your hash, the food is still worth it. Go early or be prepared to wait. And if you are a male under 30, be prepared to be eyed by some Scottsdale cougars. And if you are a wealthy single female over 45, be prepared for some competition over those cute younger guys.

As for coffee, it doesn’t get much better than Cartel. Yes, it’s hip. But hipsters know how to get a quality caffeine dose. 

Dutch Bros is good too if you want to drive through. Note, Dutch Bros only makes espresso last I checked. So if you regularly drink drip coffee, order an Americano. They have a fancy menu but can make all of the standard espresso drinks too. My lady always gets something fancy and I just get a dry cappuccino. 

Also, since you are new, know that North Scottsdale and South Scottsdale (aka Old Town) have very different vibes. N Scottsdale is more of a wealthy laid back vibe while Old Town is more of a high energy party vibe. I’ve lived in and loved both places.

"Howdy! as for 1. I can't answer that, Scottsdale is pretty nice though, can be a tad pricey but not as expensive as other places.

2. You can make friends, try go to places you like! or join a hiking group.

3. Scoop and Joy isn't a restaurant per say but their ice-cream is a great Suprise!

4. Traffic can vary depending on time, but it isn't too bad, once drove through old town mid-day and that felt like Vegas Traffic for me.

5. Summer is a dry heat. To put it in perspective, try baking cookies in your oven and when you initially open the door and feel that wave of heat, that's the summer but everywhere. Get a place that has AC. If it's hot, stay home or go to a place with ac. Buy a home with ac. Your car can and will get hot, if you have leather seats, your skin will stick to the seat and moving makes it peel off (not in a detach sort of way) so be sure to always put up some sun reflectors, although they don't get rid of the heat entirely. 

6. yep the state is filled with critters. Scorpions are a thing. however the state is full of beautiful wildlife. Hummingbirds, Quails, Peccary's' (they do get aggro though), roadrunners, and more! do your research on the life in AZ! and you can always watch the creatures thrive. This is more general but if you decided to feed birds, clean the feeders twice a month (If you don't it'd be like eating from a buffet where they never wash the dishes an silverware), and change out humming bird food as directed, don't let it ferment!

7. AZ has some wonderful trails. **DO NOT** hike on heatwave days! It is best to hike early in the morning. Bring plenty of water and know your limits. You'll see some stunning views and vistas, animals too, beware of cacti, stay safe!

8. also can't answer that but I have seen it!

one last word. AZ is NOT Allergy friendly, multiple allergists have told me this. I've lived here my entire life, and once I moved to Scottsdale my allergies got worse. Which is why I want to leave AZ. I love the state but its time for me to go.

"This is a really good set of answers.  Legit!

As a fellow PNW transplant who is actually headed back to the PNW after many years here, there's just one thing I'll add: 

""Summer"" is very, very long and feels much longer and hotter than when I arrived 2+ decades ago (data supports this being true.) 

In OR/WA, summer is 3.5-4 months of great weather. Here, it starts feeling HOT in May and doesn't usually cool down properly until late October. It's solidly 6 months of heat. It's ""summer weather"" as one might define it in the Northwest for a good 8 months here in AZ.

This was actually fun when I was younger but has been sort of tedious with a family when kids are out of school from late May until Aug 1 and there's very little to do. Summer is our winter here and we spend a lot of time inside. 

Just find a place with a great pool and highly efficient air conditioning and you'll be good! Also, plan a couple of trips back to Seattle during the hottest times 👍 

Good luck to you! AZ is a good place to be.

"I would say keep Tempe as a possibility,  throw out Gilbert chandler mesa and the whole SE valley-  just much more of a settling down having kids trying to maximize square footage type situation and far enough to where you wouldn’t make it into town that much.

"You aren’t going to be able to rent a decent play for 1800/mo BUT at 115k salary I wouldn’t want to go higher so from that perspective you have your budget right.

You might be able to get a guest house arrangement near old town for that or a small apt.

If you want a nicer setup, go North (to Scottsdale center) or south to Tempe but not too far south.

You can go east ir west a few miles without much of an issue, west may take you into Arcadia which is $$$$

Just search in a 3 mile radius and you should be fine.

That rent is doable WAY WEST (buckeye, Waddell) but the drive will make you hang youself after a week.

Can’t go too Far East because it’s Indian reservation land so it’s all north or south.

Edit: I don’t think you would, but don’t get trapped in Awatukee (so?) because all traffic blocks on one road, also a bit of that going on with parts of Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert.

"Seattle native, lived in Phoenix metro area 2012-2017.

Making friends is VERY different there. For example (and maybe it was slightly my age, single, mid 20s), but going out to bars, you actually might make casual conversation with strangers.

Meetup.com is (or at least was) very big there, and has a good participation rate, so definitely explore that for developing connections!

Re: summers, think of it as the winter; seattle is rough dec-feb, phoenix is amazing dec-feb, but in exchange, june-august id unbearable (well, i liked the heat, still rough, but unlike Seattle, everywhere is prepped with AC and misters, so it's more manageable - just get used to staying hydrated).

Speaking of hydration, tap water in the area is pretty hard (and im not a picky water person), and the cool tap won't ever actually be cold in the summer (which makes hard water a little more palatable).

"You have to find your peeps in the Valley. I suggest Meetup. You will also find hiking is accessible easily. Critters depend on where you land. Older neighborhoods dating back to the fifties don't have too many. More deserty neighborhoods with lots of xeriscaping will bring larger critters like javelina and coyotes and snakes. The best way to acclimate to the heat is to STAY OUTSIDE as much as possible your first couple of summers. Bring a lot of water and some electrolytes and do some urban hiking. The people who bitch about the heat stay huddled inside their cars and other refrigerated spaces most of the time. Just be smart about it.

"Depends on your budget, if you have $10m+ then look in Paradise Valley (85253) and if you want something more like 6-800k then look in Scottsdale. Anything up or down around Scottsdale Rd or Hayden will put you in beautiful neighborhoods in Scottsdale.

If you have a few million and love character, look in Arcadia.

Traffic is fine, NOTHING like LA. Also an amazing side perk is that the traffic everywhere including wait times at your favorite restaurants. All cut in half in the summertime because half of the population leaves and goes back to Canada or Northern US. It's sort of a nice perk to stain around the stomach in the heat.

No lie. The Summers are pretty brutal, but you get used to it pretty quickly. The time and barely notice it except for a high energy bill because your AC's running all the time, or you're getting into a hot car frequently and it takes a while for it to cool down. Most of us like to head out to pinetop to enjoy 70° days and 50° nights when it gets too hot down here.

Restaurants are great. We are really good at eating in the valley.

Stay east of the 51. Everything west of there is lower and lower income.

Stay away from the north side of South mountain completely. Interestingly enough, the south side of South mountain is ahwatukee and it's a very high-end neighborhood.

Gilbert and Chandler have blown up in the last 20 years, but they're really more family-oriented.

I think where you and your significant other are going to have. The most fun is Old Town Scottsdale, but also stuff downtown. If you land in Scottsdale. Your trip downtown shouldn't be more than 15 or 20 minutes. Lots of plays and performances and cultural type stuff.

We hike constantly and everywhere, I think you have something like 1100 trails to pick from and if you ask everyone in Phoenix you'll probably see a trend around the top 20 or so.

If you head out about an hour to 2 hours away from the valley, you get into some absolute gorgeous hikes that involve water and greenery.

It's usually not more than three or four hours to see every different kind of landscape except the ocean which is 5 and 1/2 or 6 hours over to San Diego. We also like to go down to Rocky point twice a year. That's a 4 and 1/2 hour drive.

OMG - voice to text... Do your best to understand what I dictated :)

EDIT: I forgot about scorpions - the more deserty places you live the more guarantee you will have them in the house. It's not as horrifying as you'd think - it's like a bad bee sting and they don't want to be bothered so they mostly get away from you.

If you more into older more established neighborhoods from the 80s or earlier you generally don't see them.

It does get humid though (believe it or not) when the rains come late like Aug or Sept and boy can we get mosquitos...

"1) I wouldn’t limit your search to just scottsdale, it is a very narrow city along a north to south axis and there are other areas on its edge that can be just as desirable.  If you’re planning to rent an apartment there’s a lot of new builds along McDowell road that are nice as well as north of McDowell along scottsdale road.  
2) friends- depends on what you’re into
3) lots of great restaurants/ bars in lots of parts of the valley.  Downtown PHX more of an urban/ art culture.  Tempe- college.  Old town kind of fun - can be a little yuppie/ douche bag type scene.
4) traffics not bad compared to a place like LA,  a friend I know who moved from Seattle said “you can just go a direction and keep going here” as opposed to Seattle where you’re obviously limited by water and bridges.  
5) summer sucks.  You can wake up early and be comfortable for about an hour at dawn.  Enjoy the pool and monsoons and get up to places above 6000 feet as often as you can (mogollon rim, Flagstaff area, white mountains)
6) you’ll encounter scorpions in the newer peripheral communities especially the very new ones.  The older communities that have been around for quite awhile you pretty much won’t see any.  Same goes for snakes.  
7) hiking is huge- virtually year round there is somewhere in the state with high temps In the low 70s within a couple hour drive.  Lots of Sonoran desert hikes at south mountain, Phoenix mtn preserve, and the McDowells.  A couple spots a little farther from center city are the cave creek area, superstition wilderness, and the mazatzals wilderness where you can get some elevation and trees only about an hour away.

We also have some amazing Asian food that you may not get in the midwest.  Banh mi sandwiches, Pho or ramen soup, sushi or poke bowls.

"The Wildlife World Zoo on the west side by the AirForce Base is really fun, especially before it gets crazy hot. Hickman’s eggs used to do a 2 for 1 coupon on admission inside the cartons so you may be able to find a discount & you can feed giraffes & stuff there. We always liked it a little better than Phoenix zoo.

Undertow in Phoenix is super cool, it’s a bar made to look like the inside of a pirate ship. My coworkers also used to love going to Mellow Mushroom

Sedona is a really fun day trip, but might be better during the week because of the crazy traffic recently. Devils Bridge is a great hike there. 

Also the Grand Canyon is a haul but really worth the drive if you haven’t gone yet. Might be more than a day trip but I’ve taken a couple people over the years & it’s always breathtaking.
