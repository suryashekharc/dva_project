Lake Wausau has a lot of Kayak opportunities and is pretty safe.  I see a lot of them in the summer time.  Weston also has an actual kayak launch.  There is also a world class rapids where they do kayak races every year, although I’m not sure if they’ve been doing it with Covid going on.

I would recommend SC Swiderski for rentals.  They’re going to be a touch more expensive but they’re also nicer.  They are great land lords as well.  Wausau’s west side has quite a few duplex rentals, near the hospital if you’re looking more for that.

"Ah, dang. Yeah, I've found this to be a problem with most places in Wisconsin, save for places too expensive (Madison) or too crime-ridden (Milwaukee). Actually, I think this is kind of the idea for most places in America in general, based on my research.

I've basically realized there's this triangle of things, and you can only have two of them but not the third. Safety, amenities, and affordability. If something is fairly safe and affordable, usually the amenities are really spread out or just non-existent - but if something has many close amenities and it's safe, it's hard to afford living there, and if a place is affordable and has a bunch of amenities then... well you get the idea.

My town right now *used to be* that last one many years ago. Low safety, good amenities and cost of living. But nowadays it's expensive too. In any case, I've lived in a country where everything is close-by and walkable in a majority of cities there, and I'm used to living my life here in America without requiring a car to survive right now as well - and it frustrates me I'll be required to spend thousands on a vehicle, pay insurance on it and etc, just to live a normal life anywhere but where I live currently. Like many cities don't give you a choice as to how you want to travel, even small towns sort of force you into spending thousands of dollars. But I don't want to spend money on a car and on insurance if I can help it. I don’t even like driving, I much prefer cycling.

In any case, ranting aside, I have accepted that I only have so many choices here. Wausau still seems like a decent enough place, and I can only hope I can find a regular spot or two downtown to frequent, like the local mall there (if it's still standing), or some kind of Cafe or art place or something.

"I can't really specify on a place to live in Wausau, as I've never lived in Wausau itself (only in Weston/Schofield and Rib Mountain), but we do have local TCG stores! I don't know if they run D&D but they definitely do card tournaments and such.

In the summer we have some art events, Art in the Park and Chalkfest are two big ones. We also have the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum within a short drive.

Lately a local person has been putting together some really great local events, too. Her name is Kayley McColley. There was a Juneteeth celebration in downtown Wausau that I attended (it was awesome!), and a reproductive rights rally a few months ago. Wasn't able to attend that one because I got sick.

"Many happy memories over the years. I’m mid 60’s. My first memories of the Grand are Christmas parties where the local paper mill rented out the theater for the children of the employees. I’m thinking it was Amaerican Can company. Don’t remember much about the shoe but I do remember getting mesh bags of chocolate coins wrapped in foil. 

In those days it was a movie theater. Most memorable were the Friday the 13th horror movies when I was a teenybopper. The theater was crammed with us little horny monsters and the management was surprisingly laid back about us taking over the theater. Lots of yelling at the screen and running around while Vincent Price and Christopher Lee performed the classics. I specifically remember a movie about a disembodied hand doing murder and someone white legs that only grew overnight also doing murder. Good times all around.

I need to mention the amazing organ with pipes, drums and various other sounds coming from behind curtains at the side of the theater. Many time at intermission (look it up) someone in a tux would come down the aisle and enter the orchestra pit only to re-emerge as the organ console rose from the pit with music being played. You don’t see things like that anymore.

Fianlly, after the latest renovations it has become a very upscale type of venue. I’ve seen a string quartet with my young son who was at the time a budding violinist in middle school. One of my favorites was the Bulgarian State Opera doing the marriage if Figgaro (this was a birthday gift from my wife). 

This place is unique and an amazing asset to the area. (Did I mention a performance of Godspell featuring my wife’s boss?) the worst experience I ever had there was the movie “Death In Venice” on a high school date, and even that is a find memory.

"I have also found this to be true. I have lived in Wisconsin for over 15 years now. 

Everywhere you go, there is a common theme, like a thread that ties everyone of that place together. Sadly, what you mention is the core of one of the two threads that I have determined of people where I currently live. While I can't speak for the whole of Wisconsin, I have found that one of the tenets of the area that I am in, specifically, is: 

""It is more important to be polite than it is to be honest.""

In case you are wondering, the other tenet of this area I have determined is: ""Good enough is good enough and that's good enough.""

It's sad, really.

"No, I'm not from WI, I'm actually from the east coast. It's not sarcastic humor that I notice which I get when I'm in front of the person. It's mean-spirited trash talk. For example, a coworker offered to drive another person home. The next day, the person that drove the other person home talked about how small the other person's home was and started getting into how that person is probably poor. Until that person that they drove home showed up. Then it was all smiling and pleasantries.

Another example is during the winter two years ago. A neighbor finished shoveling another neighbors driveway and sidewalk. After their ""kind"" exchange that neighbor started to complain to me about having to shovel that neighbors front lawn and how lazy that neighbors kids are.

These are just two of many examples that I've witnessed and as I type this- it seems like the root cause is people exhausting their kindness to appear good-natured (when in actuality they are just as human as everyone else).

It's not the Rocky mountains, but it's the biggest hill you'll find in the area for skiing. If you're willing to drive 3ish hours north, there's more skiing. There's also a cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the area. Check out the state park system. You'll find there are many state parks and natural areas for your enjoyment year round.

"[511wi.gov map](https://511wi.gov/) with the Winter Road Conditions layer checked is your friend in the winter so you can get a heads-up of what to expect.

Highway 29 does have some potential for blowing snow due to more farms (ie. open areas) being found along that highway, but nothing to get too paranoid over.  Just something to be mindful of on blizzard-like days.

If your husband does any type of work that would allow him to work remotely on occasion, he could talk with his employer about doing that on some of the crummier winter days to avoid the commute altogether.

Overall the drive is pretty simple and the highway does stay well-salted.  There may be a ""perfect storm"" once in a while where it's still snowing in the morning and the commute will take longer, but just leave earlier and plan for it so you don't feel rushed.

"Supposedly the Grand is haunted by the ghost of a former stage manager that wanders the backstage area at night, though it seems every theater is ""haunted"" in some capacity these days. Whether it's ""real"" or not really depends on who you talk to.

I heard a lot of stories about a misty figure that supposedly roams Marathon Park at night, but that was way back in the 90's and I don't think there was anything of substance to that one.

One of the paranormal groups from Milwaukee said they tried to follow up on a story from a nurse at Aspirus Wausau hospital who claimed that one of the rooms on the top floor was haunted by the ghost of an old woman. I heard that at Egocon in like 2017 though, and again, not much to go on except the story from a friend of a friend.

Best one though in my opinion, and the one I've actually seen, is the light on the train bridge that runs parallel to Washington street over the river. Stories vary a bit as to what it is- the most common being it's the ghost of some old railway man, but the effect is that there's a flickering light that sways about partway across the bridge before disappearing. I've seen it twice back when I visited friends who lived just north of downtown- both times it was after midnight, and it honestly looks like there's somebody out there with a lamp or a flashlight or something, but when you get closer there's nothing there.

Could very well be a trick of the light, a weird reflection, or something else entirely causing it- I'm not saying it's haunted here. But there is something ""spooky"" about that bridge in design if nothing else, if you're looking to see something cool.

Hopefully others chime in. I know there were some ""haunted houses"" and the usual ""haunted cemeteries"" but I don't know where or which ones anymore.",t2_wfvjcf7,Maklarr4000,0,1628750120.0,0,t1_h8mjc2d,h8mjc2d,True,HilltopBeanClub,t3_p2tq8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wausau/comments/p2tq8m/haunted_locations_or_urban_legends_in_wausau/,Haunted locations or urban legends in Wausau?,/r/wausau/comments/p2tq8m/haunted_locations_or_urban_legends_in_wausau/h8mjc2d/,10,r/wausau,0,10

"Another idiot that thinks they're fighting ""corporate fat cats"" by forcing mom and pop shops to pay people more than they can afford. Bezos and the Washington Post say: ""pay people above market rates, that way massive corporations that control our information can pay, and little people go out of business.""

""We're also going to import people who work for $30/day, but don't look over there. All Americans will either not have a job, or they will work for us. It's your best interest we have in mind.""

This guy: ""you're god damn right, I'm fighting corporations. Im doing exactly what they tell me to do to increase their bottom line. That's how you fight them. If you just destroy all their competition, they will be weakened.""

I just want to know if they are going to take out my recycling twice a week, because if they close up Grebes, my wife is going to order a bunch of shit that comes in boxes. Seriously, the number of boxes that I have in my garage since the stay at home order ended hasn't decreased. My wife now does everything online. 

I understand that a better mousetrap sells itself. Why do we need the government to shut down small market mousetrap manufacturing? Why have you all been fed this information? Who gains from forcing employers to pay more than a worker is worth?

"My husband and I moved here from Stevens Point (about 30 minutes south) in March of last year, on the north side. We’re in our late 20s and our next door neighbors on one side are about our age, maybe a few years older. Across the street in back there are a couple of young families, the kids are out and about again now that the weather is getting warmer but last summer we regularly had a neighboring toddler finding his way into our garden 😂
We live on a somewhat busy one-way street, but my assumption is that the street behind our house isn’t too busy, seeing as how the kids use the whole block for various activities, like hide-n-seek. 
With having moved here a week before the safer at home order went into effect last year, and just having gotten our second doses of the vaccine, I’m finally now able to explore the area. I went rollerblading around the neighborhood a bit last year and I’m always heading to Pick ‘n Save a few blocks away. I’ve never felt unsafe here.

"Welcome!   
As someone who grew up right up the street from a paper mill...yeah, best to avoid them. Names to keep in mind would be Rothschild (where I lived), and Mosinee as those are where two mills are located. There are definitely some really cute neighborhoods there, but the air quality and smell can be an issue. Checking out Kronenwetter, Rib Mountain, or even Weston and Schofield might be a good idea. Stevens Point is about 30 minutes away from Wausau, really nice local college town.   


Yeah, the area can be pretty conservative, and is really white, but I hope that doesn't put you off. There are left leaning pockets in pretty much every neighborhood, and even out in the boonies people are pretty chill. Of course I'm biased, I'm white as hell so direct racism and hate like that is not something I've ever experienced. I can say that as a part of the LGBTQ community, and in no way am I comparing homophobia to racism, I've struggled at times growing up in the area.

"Google a realtor. You're not going to find anything ""not safe"" compared to Chicagoland. We don't have many shootings. We had one kidnapping by some perve who's gone, and it was in like Shano or something. There's plenty of not white people here. I like Austin Solomon (maybe Soloman). It'll be much easier, and quicker finding something to buy with some help. I'm not sure if he does rental stuff, but I am sure he can point you to someone who does. Just a really pretty nice, and genuine person.

Edit: Mosinee is the papermill. It's 20-30 min from Wausau. There is nowhere in Wausau, Weston, Schofield, or Rib Mountain that smell.

Edit: like 20% of wausau isn't white. You're not going to get lynched, no matter what the news tells you. Wausau proper is probably the most liberal city in the area. If you want to live around people that may or may not look like you, they are still safe areas. 

You'll have a hard time finding a rental with a bigger dog. I had a hard time with a 35lb dog. Houses get bought as quickly as they get put on the market.

"Following their last comprehensive plan the city realized they needed to overhaul and modernize their zoning.  If you look at the older zoning, there was no mixed-use as-a-right, it required special review.  The city worked with a consultant ([http://www.vandewalle.com/](http://www.vandewalle.com/)) who developed the new zoning code based upon community input.  The code actually appears to be a hybrid of several different popular concepts and ideas and which draw inspiration from what was being done by the consultant in other cities at the time.

Presentation on the zoning changes from consultant: [https://www.wausaudevelopment.com/Portals/0/Resources/Documents/OpenHousePresentation.pdf](https://www.wausaudevelopment.com/Portals/0/Resources/Documents/OpenHousePresentation.pdf)

One of the goals the city had was encouraging ""high-quality new multi-family development"" which stems from the fact that much of the older housing was pretty bland. It you look at older apartments on Grand Ave ([https://goo.gl/maps/rSNdRArD2vJrULYg9](https://goo.gl/maps/rSNdRArD2vJrULYg9)), they are all single material facades with minimum articulation and variance in colors, textures. The city wanted to encourage developments which looked more modern so the new code included design controls for how building facades should be expressed.   I am not sure I disagree with their idea that we need better design, but I think the implementation and methods used to achieve it could be further refined to allow for a wider array of potential designs.",t2_3th087v,honest86,0,1619379254.0,0,t1_gvum15y,gvum15y,False,Maklarr4000,t3_mxrlei,https://www.reddit.com/r/wausau/comments/mxrlei/wausau_economic_development_committee_selects/,Wausau Economic Development Committee Selects Proposal for Riverlife North Development,/r/wausau/comments/mxrlei/wausau_economic_development_committee_selects/gvum15y/,2,r/wausau,0,2

"The first three floors are mostly brick, and to answer your question about why this building looks like every other building and why it can't have a classic brick façade you should take a peek at the [2020 Wausau Zoning Code](https://www.ci.wausau.wi.us/Portals/0/Departments/Inspections/Documents/2020CityofWausauZoningCode.pdf) \- Specifically section 23.07.20(3) - Façade Articulation for multifamily, & 23.07.30(2)-Façade Articulation for Mixed Use;  it requires that facades longer than 40' on multifamily buildings(70' for mixed use) need recesses and projections in the façade and roof form variations.   

Additionally it says:

> Buildings shall be designed to provide interest and variety. Flat, unadorned walls shall be avoided. Each façade of a building shall include at least 1 design element to break up the flatness of blank walls and shall at a minimum include varied materials or colors, change in texture, expressed joints and details, or surface relief. 

I.E., the façade must to be made of more than 1 material, in more than 1 color, and have a difference in textures.   

If you don't like this type of design or you wish developers would build other designs, then these rules need to be changed and you should be talking to your city council representatives, and attending and speaking with the Plan Commission([https://www.ci.wausau.wi.us/Departments/CityCouncil/BoardsCommitteesCommissions/PlanCommission.aspx](https://www.ci.wausau.wi.us/Departments/CityCouncil/BoardsCommitteesCommissions/PlanCommission.aspx)) about adopting less prescriptive zoning to allow greater design flexibility.",t2_3th087v,honest86,0,1619369188.0,0,t1_gvu0hto,gvu0hto,False,Maklarr4000,t3_mxrlei,https://www.reddit.com/r/wausau/comments/mxrlei/wausau_economic_development_committee_selects/,Wausau Economic Development Committee Selects Proposal for Riverlife North Development,/r/wausau/comments/mxrlei/wausau_economic_development_committee_selects/gvu0hto/,5,r/wausau,0,5

https://maps.app.goo.gl/wC7S6NwTAt8uF6Qa9
It isn't very long

Thrive is right in that area. Good locally sourcedish food. 

Bull Falls brewery has some good beer.

Wausau on the Water has lazer tag, and adult games (kinda like Dave and Busters). 

Glass Hat usually has a DJ or live music on the weekends. Kinda flat caps and expensive sneakers crowd.

Malarkey's is more chill, usually acoustic music, and a great beer selection. Thursday is open mic. Fri sat is live bands. I think they have a pub trivia night as well.

Ciao is an upscalish place with great food.

The 400 block (where Ciao, and Malarkey's is located) is usually pretty fun. 

Oz is the gay bar (also 400 block). 

Woodson Art Museum has a lot of nature/bird art (if that is what you're into. 

If you like UFC, Pro Players will have the fights this weekend. 

Masa sushi can compete with any sushi joint in any city (maybe not costal cities).

Day's Bowl a Dome is a fun sports bar/bowling alley. 

Timekeeper Distillery is a fun local distiller. It's conveniently close to Hiawatha (a pretty good restaurant).

Red Eye has good food, and a great beer selection. 

The Great Dane is a Madison based chain brewery/restaurant. I think there are only 4 locations, so it isn't Applebee's (we have one of those too). 

Milwaukee Burger is similar, and they have the best (most ridiculous) bloodies. https://images.app.goo.gl/DQpCJBy61pwcDmAR6
Yes that is a cheeseburger. 

Eau Claire Dells is 35 min drive, but is a very beautiful nature hike.

As someone whose worked in daycare that's probably going to be more in your daughter then on the daycare. As you say she hasn't socialized with kids so of course she is going to stay around an adult because that's what she is comfortable with. Switching schools isn't going to help and will actually make it worse imo because she'll just have a whole new group of kids she doesn't know. Day care kids don't really have cliques that exclude they are just kids that play with the same toys. If you really want to have her socialize then you or your SO need to go spend some time at the daycare and play with the other kids.

"First, this is a press release, not a ""hit piece.""

Second, this press release is consistent with my platform - and I'm the only candidate for this position with an *actual* platform.

[From the beginning](https://medium.com/@loudenslager/campaign-statement-loudenslager-for-wisconsin-court-of-appeals-e8f87e85ef50), my campaign has focused on advocating for judicial candidates to get back to basics - such as refraining from having recent and current ties with the politically connected, speaking at political conventions, and accepting large amounts of money to finance campaigns. When judicial candidates decide to engage in this conduct - while ignoring the significant understaffing of support staff in the Wisconsin judicial system they will be serving - it creates the appearance that political connections, wealth, and obtaining judicial positions are more important objectives, and more important *values*, to those judicial candidates than concretely helping the citizenry-at-large have a functioning judicial system.

Unlike my opponents in this election, I have advocated for improvements to the Wisconsin judicial system even when it potentially put my legal career in jeopardy, such as when: (1) I filed an administrative rule petition and accompanying memorandum with the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reform the illegal and intrusive process Wisconsin utilized when evaluating prospective lawyers’ character and fitness to practice law - a process which contravened federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (2) while serving as a staff attorney at the Dane County Circuit Court, I testified before the Dane County Board of Supervisors’ Public Protection and Judiciary Committee about inadequate staffing levels — not only at the Dane County Circuit Court, but throughout the Wisconsin court system as a whole.

Third, you're more worried about the character of a candidate who calls out his judicial opponents for questionable conduct than the character of a candidate who has consciously chosen to have an ongoing professional relationship with an extreme nationalist? That certainly is an *interesting* perspective - and one that seems to forgot that elections historically involve critiquing the records, views, and platforms of various candidates. But in any event, if your best critique of my record is the press release I issued on Monday, then that is not much of a critique.",t2_56h2air1,loudens1,0,1608740516.0,0,t1_ggt3x0b,ggt3x0b,True,loudens1,t3_ki81dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wausau/comments/ki81dy/wisconsin_judge_hires_extreme_nationalist_as/,Wisconsin Judge Hires Extreme Nationalist as Campaign Manager for Higher Court,/r/wausau/comments/ki81dy/wisconsin_judge_hires_extreme_nationalist_as/ggt3x0b/,1,r/wausau,0,1

"“New card.” I try to act casual about it but I’m smiling proudly. “What do you think?”

“Whoa,” McDermott says, lifting it up, fingering the card, genuinely impressed. “Very nice. Take a look.” He hands it to Van Patten.

“Picked them up from the printer’s yesterday,” I mention.

“Cool coloring,” Van Patten says, studying the card closely.

“That’s bone,” I point out. “And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.”

Yes it’s up a higher percentage in comparison to its own previous market. What it’s not up in is dollar value. Wausau is merely playing catch up with Madison’s housing market.

"Lol! We can agree that you have no idea what you're talking about, basing your entire opinion on a day visit to the area. Are you aware that the housing market in Wausau is up 7.1% over last year while the Madison area is only up 4.7%? Or how the Wausau area is one of the primary cities attracting Millennials and showing growth in the state? I'm sure you didn't.

I don't see the disparity because its not there. As I mentioned, I moved back north from the area you claim ""is better"" and I'll be honest, its not. I bought a rental property I'm fixing up because the market in Wausau is better than it was in Madison. So again, please save your generalizations and keep you opinions to yourself unless you care to prove it with any data. Saying you witnessed ""disparity in Wausau"" is like me saying I drove down Milwaukee or East Johnson Street in Madison and saw disparity.
