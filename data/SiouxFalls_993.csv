Some of the cops are buddies with the judges though so that’s not be  a 100 percent guarantee.",t2_l4xqudbs,wilrx059,0,1648248054.0,0,t1_i24io9a,i24io9a,True,_thegrimscrim,t3_tjcbfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiouxFalls/comments/tjcbfi/speeding_ticket_advice/,Speeding Ticket Advice,/r/SiouxFalls/comments/tjcbfi/speeding_ticket_advice/i24io9a/,1,r/SiouxFalls,0,1

"Not directly related, as I haven't stayed in any Lloyd properties. But I want to advise you against any Elevate Living properties. They're terrible, and management will do anything they can to hit you with extra fines. Several people received eviction warnings for being less than 2 weeks late on a single rent payment, even during the federal eviction ban, and one of my neighbors was threatened with eviction (again, during the federal eviction ban) for changing his car's flat tire in the parking lot.

Never had anyone show up drunk but sounds fun!

"Most of my relatives or classmates who've been caught with weed or worse have been let off the hook, but I've heard there's some pretty bad racial disparities with our local judiciary when it comes to prosecuting and convicting for minor drug crimes.

"I'll break down my thoughts like I did the Tenhaken one.

I like:

- Decriminalizing weed would be great, especially if the Pen is as full as I hear. A mayor can't really legalize, though you could tell SFPD to not go after anyone for minor possession. The difference would be one would still have to buy from a dealer or bring it down from Flandeau. That difference would still help a lot of people out in the city. 

- I'm down for more green initiatives. I think my local section of the bike trail is already nearly all native grasses, but if city engineers are sure tree roots won't negatively effect levees or river banks, I'm all for planting a line of trees. If solar heat can make a difference for large buildings like the Pavillion, then I think that's a great investment too. 

- I support decreasing penalties for minor crimes in general, but I don't really know how many would fall under Municipal laws?

- Additional budget for Police training is good. One issue a lot of cops talk about is how little they're actually trained for stressful situations which can lead to tragedies even when one is not a Derek Chauvin tier prick. SFPD has it's issues but is otherwise pretty non-offensive outside of the few pedos that got busted. Training, from conflict resolution to even additional range time can help keep it that way. 

- That you're running as someone with your own issues and not as a party or platform. Civil engagement that isn't just voting is stellar. I'd be wanting to run for something local myself if I wasn't absolutely sure I'd be caught on camera calling someone a dumb fucker or worse on the campaign trail. I have a bit of ""engineer mouth"" and don't have the charisma or patience for politics. 

- I'm not sure how big of an issue Zoning is for house building (u/sodakzak could probably answer this for me), but if lack of residential land is a problem, lets get crackin. 

Cons:

- Less specifics than I'd want. Lot of things I agree with heartily on principle. But specifically how would one support food forests? Municipal run businesses in areas like off Kiwanis that are now fairly far from grocery stores? Tax breaks for private grocers to move into areas of need? I generally see good things without detail of implementation to be platitudes.

- I hope to god the bounty system on meth dealers is in the vein of paying people if someone is successfully prosecuted that you called a tip in for, and not like, a bounty-bounty. If it's the first one, I think we already have that. Would the tip bounty just be raised for Meth dealers/manufacturers? 

- Could you really clean up the Big Sioux? Sure, there's likely trash to pull out of the river, but isn't the worst part of the Big Sioux is from ag runoff from farms upstream.

- Are there not reasons construction is not generally done at night or around the clock already? I'd imagine it's harder to see construction workers and there's additional costs for lights and paying a premium for workers to work nights, along with concerns about more drunk drivers being on the road. If these concerns aren't issues, then it's not a bad idea.

- Not a big direction for how to grow the city outside of fixing some annoyances and fixing food deserts. Sioux falls is a city that currently leans on the Finance sector hard but has few of the nice Fin-tech or higher end banking jobs. There've been attempts at drawing in a bigger tech scene that have had middling success. Would you lean one way or another?

"I took a quick look at Mayor Paul’s plan before a Dakota News interview and it mostly sounds very nice.  I wish I had confidence in what I read but I don’t.  One big part of his plan was transparency in government.  Well then how about being transparent about bribery among city officials?   Two years ago the city’s ethics board reported city officials commonly accepted gifts of paid travel.  That’s illegal and I’ve been trying to get more information ever since.  And if he likes to meet with people why won’t he make an appointment with me?  It would be nice just to say hi let’s have an issued-based campaign.  

I don’t want to target TenHaken for personal criticism because he’s a man doing a job the way most people would.  The system is broken, not the people involved.  The system encourages me to doubt the sincerity of most politicians because expensive elections cause politicians to sell out and then we have a real mess.

"Here's my perspective on the stuff I actually know enough to have opinions on. 

Pros:

- More Positive achievements in general than I'd expect. A few seem to be fluffed up and I'd like to see the actual effect these programs actually had, but not bad.

- More mental health space/assistance for people under the poverty line is a great thing to work on. The state of mental health in the US has been a severe issue since the 80s that is underreported on. 

- Infrastructure good, I'm all for fixing stuff and expanding roads and whatnot as the city grows.

Cons:

- We have loads of RL examples showing Austerity politics does not work. I'm not excited to see the future economic plan to be harder Austerity, especially if we're running a surplus this year anyway

- The Economic future for the city looks pretty Bearish compared to what I would have thought, but that's the breaks when it comes to being reliant on sales tax when COVID is still affecting people's shopping habits.  

- The tech plan for the future seems like it reads as ""we will do good tech stuff"" but isn't outlining a solid plan outside of cybersecurity efforts.

- Attacking Poverty while completely shunning handouts is a bad way to go about it. I'm all for opening up opportunities, but if someone's got no fixed abode, it's hard to see companies hiring them even with systems meant to help people get jobs. There really needs to be a balance, because companies aren't gonna take on the risk of getting someone in a stable position. There's gotta be a balanced approach. 

- Talent recruitment is all well and good, but I'm wary of the risk/reward of putting millions into such a program. I get that my field is an outlier for how subpar pay is compared to equivalent COL markets, but I think we need to look at the factors causing the brain drain to begin with, though many of those are way out of the Mayor of SF's control. I might be pessimistic because Des Moines has a high powered expensive municipal program made to bring in young professionals, and by all accounts it sucks at actually linking people with employers.

"Last year we had one get together at the beginning of the year where the entire league's new players took some infield and live BP on Augustana's field. Other than that it's pretty much a practice on your own thing. Last Sunday one of my teammates set up a get together and we practiced on Harmodon. 

Pretty much at your own pace sort of thing. If you want to practice more I'm sure you'd find guys in the league that would be willing to get together more often. If you're on a team that actually has practices you won't be demoted or benched for not going to practice. Last year we had games where we batted 12 and rotated fielding as we saw fit. Everyone pays so everyone plays type of mentality.

"I have been but am not currently in the bike industry. I think that it will be hard to find someone that will do this for you. Most bike shop techs have probably never done this type of work. There also is a fair amount of liability in a 750w system. The bike isn't made for the extra weight and speeds that the motor and battery add. They don't want to be liable for you making poor speed decisions on your overpowered machine.  Between the liability and time it could take, I would expect labor rates of $300 on the low end up to $1000. When you consider that some shops charge $250-300 for an in-season tune up, this isn't too high of a guess.

"Real low skill level! My buddy and I hadn't played in over 10 years. Last year was our first year in the league. I batted .290, him like .450 and won league MVP. We both got on base the same amount of times though! The pitching in the National League is basically lobbing it in just trying to get it over the plate. If you haven't played in a while they will start you in national league. It's a great entry point to get back into the sport. I was super nervous I would suck after not having played in so long and this was a great way to get my feet wet and get some confidence back.

It's nothing like slow pitch softball in terms of competitiveness which is why I like this league so much. It's super chill and low key. A guy and I were just talking about that at practice yesterday that slow pitch in Sioux Falls is such a turn off because of how competitive and serious guys take it.

There was a guy on my team last year who hadn't played since little league. He batted like .250. If you played in high school you'll be fine!

"The quotes are because when a lot people say they went to court to challenge a ticket, they are just going to the initial hearing at 1A, which isn't he actual trial.  You are correct that violating policy doesn't change the fact that OP was speeding, but now it puts the burden on the officer and prosecutor to show that there was a reason for deviating from policy and the officer's own work history to justify stopping someone for going 3mph.  You can pretty much ask any officer (when off duty) what their department policies as well as their own track record are and they will tell you.

"Yes the officer will be there if it goes ""to trial"".  Here's where it gets interesting.  The officer is going to have to show that they had a consistent track record of stops and tickets for 3mph over (well, if you actually make it to a court room to dispute it) and that no other factors played into the officer's decision to stop you.  The better option is probably to call the city attorney's office, say you had a ticket and want to speak to the attorney handling the case, and just ask them to drop it.  Unless it's a school zone, it's uncommon that cities or counties even allow officers to stop someone for 3mph over, the most common numbers I've heard are 9mph for a stop, 13mph over for a ticket.  So now the officer is going to have to state, in a courtroom, why they deviated from policy and their own history to stop someone for a very minor infraction and unless you're a white, protestant, straight, clean shaven, male with short hair, it's a no-win situation for the city where the slightest slip of the tongue in the courtroom creates a headache for the city that'll cost far more than the ~$80 ticket they handed you.

Edit: It should be mentioned that if you decide to ""fight it"" and the judge doesn't drop it at your 1A hearing (or whatever it is called these days) it'll take some work on your part to make this happen, you can compel the cop to show up and defend the ticket, offer their evidence, you would have to request their records as part of the discovery process, etc",t2_yxsos,hallese,0,1647871440.0,0,t1_i1j4r9l,i1j4r9l,True,_thegrimscrim,t3_tjcbfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiouxFalls/comments/tjcbfi/speeding_ticket_advice/,Speeding Ticket Advice,/r/SiouxFalls/comments/tjcbfi/speeding_ticket_advice/i1j4r9l/,32,r/SiouxFalls,0,32

"I agree that it was overpriced, but a big part of the reason for that is that it was never designed to be a standalone parking garage. It was overengineered because it was intended from the beginning to support a 13 (and later 15) story building. Now that we have an overbuilt, unfinished parking garage, it makes no financial sense to leave it unfinished for even more years to come, both in terms of revenue a finished development has the potential to bring in and legal fees it would take to continue fighting with the original developer. There was no legal way to ""fix"" the situation as long as the issue with the original developers went unsettled, which is why it was on hold for 3 years.

"Starting when Mike Huether was in office, and continuing after Paul TenHaken became mayor, I pointed out multiple problems with this project.  Some of the issues were that it was way overpriced, cost per parking space was 2.5 times what it should have been!  The city picked a disreputable builder, and two administrations failed to answer multiple questions about the secret planning process.  Don’t forget the city planner involved got a job with a builder.   I wonder how much of a raise that was.   After TenHaken took office I presented these issues to him and city council and they all re-approved the project.   I wasn’t surprised but I was certainly disappointed.  Local government is corrupt and this parking garage is the result of that corruption.  Giving half a million dollars to someone who screws up a big project just looks like more corruption to me.  I’m surprised the city didn’t continue litigation while simultaneously trying to fix a broken project.

">The Canada convoy has zero fatalities or injuries.

Wrong. The Truckers assaulted locals, broke into buildings, and shit all over the place when the businesses closed up shop due to the convoy, leaving the truckers bathroomless. They were extremely assholish, and the locals wanted them gone. 

Also their demands were to literally be given control of government, and while that was an unrealistic ask that they were never going to get, a goddamn coup attempt is not ""peaceful"" even if it's being done with the dumbest protest that was aimed at harassing one rando community.

"I hear you. I would note that there's a lot of effective marketing that caters to the lowest denominator, most probably. I have been doing it for 15 years, and I've been in a lot of campaigns for products and policy (for industry, not party).

Is the immature piece the main reason you think it doesnt work?

I think it might move the needle a bit because it's right at the point when a person is emotional about paying more. Again, a non-engaged, which is the important demographic. 

This aims to put Biden in people's minds when they think gas prices.
