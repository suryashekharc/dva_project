"Right...  How is that related to abortion and the right to choose?  Do you think that if someone can choose to have an abortion, then anyone should be able to force a miscarriage through assault?  Neither side is looking to let violent criminals out.  We're all in agreement that causing the termination of someone else's pregnancy is bad.

They're unrelated.  This isn't about whether abortion ends a life, or when life begins.  That's an argument without an answer.  We can talk about heartbeats, and theorize about consciousness, but it just doesn't matter.  An unborn child has no autonomy.

It's about bodily autonomy and privacy in regards to fundamental rights (and only fundamental rights).  In Roe v Wade, the court decided (rightly in my opinion) that those fundamental rights included procreation, contraception, and child rearing.

Context is the difference between a lot of legal and criminal acts.  Consentual sex is legal.  Nonconsentual sex is rape.  Driving 100 mph on a race track is legal.  Driving 100 mph on the highway is not.  Terminating your own pregnancy is legal.

"That's simply not true. How is it that some LITERALLY ARBITRARY number on a sign decides what is reckless and what isn't. There is part of 169 that is 70, another part with the same construction and frequency of on ramps is 65. How is 70 reckless in one spot and not in another?  When it is raining cats and dogs, the sign still reads ""arbitrary number"" but to go that speed would be reckless, but not breaking the limit. A McLaren has insane handling and braking, going 150 in one is not unsafe given there isn't any other traffic, say on a completely empty stretch of a turnpike where literally no other car could possibly merge into your path. But in a Dodge Neon, that's an insane speed and certainly is reckless. 

There are MANY extenuating circumstances that can make X speed reckless or not. But yet the number on the sign always says the same thing. 

Exceeding a SAFE AND PRUDENT speed is reckless, exceeding an arbitrary number on a sign is not INHERENTLY reckless.",t2_k6xcy,TeleKenetek,0,1648248839.0,0,t1_i24kfwr,i24kfwr,False,louisvillebandit,t3_tnrpij,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tnrpij/speed_trap_169_46th/,Speed trap 169 & 46th,/r/tulsa/comments/tnrpij/speed_trap_169_46th/i24kfwr/,-6,r/tulsa,0,-6

"She's not wrong. Gender and sex are complicated. There are over 25 genes that control various aspects of sexual characteristics and hormones. And genetics are sloppy with wide variance and a regular number of translation errors and mutations. It's why none of us look alike. Or why Phelps makes half as much lactic acid as most humans. 15% of the population falls outside of the range of genetic variance of what we describe as typical genetic female or male.

 It doesn't change the fact that most people with uterus are women. So the best way of knowing whether someone is a woman is because they tell you they are.

It also doesn't change the fact that asking a scouts nominee to define woman hasn't ever been asked of any other judge before, but I bet they would give you the same answer. It's not their area of expertise nor their job to define categories. It is their job to interpret the law.

Conservatives are using identity politics during these hearings to win votes in the upcoming election. It is almost as if they think their constituents are so stupid and emotion driven that they cannot parse evidence nor care about actual impact a person will have on their actual lives.

"Speed is not a crime. There is no victim when someone speeds. If a person causes a wreck, then they were driving recklessly, which becomes a crime when another citizen is victimized (bodily harm or property damage), or when the state is victimized through the damage of state property (hitting a guardrail for example). Some of the safest sections of road in the world, in terms of wrecks per mile driven, are the unlimited sections of the Autobahn.


Creating a large speed differential, by driving either much slower or much faster than the flow of traffic, is reckless driving.

"Perhaps an analogy will help you overcome the ignorance that led to this false equivalency. 

A pregnant woman defending her body from nonconsensual use by a fetus is like a homeowner protecting themselves from an unwanted intruder breaking in. And forcing themselves on the homeowner. You would not be charged with murder for defending yourself.

A stranger killing a pregnant woman and a fetus is like a stranger killing a homeowner and their guest. Of course they will be charged for both murders.

It's ludicrous and dishonest that you would even try to compare the two. The only way this could possibly make any modicum of sense as an argument is if my position was ""a fetus is not a person, that's why it's okay to kill them."" That very clearly has not been my argument. So not only is your comment a false equivalency, it's also a strawman.

This tells me that you are either:

* Being incredibly dishonest, hoping we don't notice this embarrassingly irrelevant attempt to completely reframe the discussion. 

Or

* You're incapable of engaging intellectually with the conversation, and instead have opted to just regurgitate points you've heard in other abortion arguments that have nothing to do with this one.

"I didn't say that you didn't support those things, I was just making a point.

When you or I think a fetus becomes a person doesn't matter. Women don't go into an abortion clinic late in the pregnancy unless there's a medical issue. Putting an exact date on when it is and isn't ok to get an abortion is stupid because it just makes it harder for the people who don't want to but need to get one.

If a women wants an abortion from the beginning, she's going to do it as early as she's able and she should be free to do that without anyone she doesn't want around bothering her or being involved. 

If you want to argue that life begins at conception or whenever and that thing immediately has rights, why do its rights supersede those of its mother? Why does she have to keep something in her body without her permission? If someone comes in my house, I don't have to let them stay and feed them and take care of them. Why does it get free reign of her body, which is a much more personal invasion? 

I think sex should be a fun thing you do with any other consenting person and the goal shouldn't have to be pregnancy. If whatever measures you take to avoid pregnancy fail, I don't think the people involved should be forced to bring a person into the world that they can't or don't want to take care of.",t2_mwtjq1,Austin_T117,0,1648223579.0,0,t1_i22uci8,i22uci8,False,Heavenandhealthy,t3_tn9vw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tn9vw6/does_anyone_in_oklahoma_care_about_women_or_girls/,Does anyone in Oklahoma care about women or girls at all?,/r/tulsa/comments/tn9vw6/does_anyone_in_oklahoma_care_about_women_or_girls/i22uci8/,7,r/tulsa,0,7

"PLEASE READ THIS 10 TIMES THEN COMMENT, this EXPLAINS pretty much every comment I have read so far.

Romans 1:21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.  
24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.  
26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. ***27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.***  
28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. 32 Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.",t2_3le2he11,Algo_Tip,0,1648220053.0,0,t1_i22lfj9,i22lfj9,True,OkieTaco,t3_tn7l7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tn7l7d/asbury_splits_from_united_methodist_church_over/,Asbury splits from United Methodist Church over differing views regarding LGBTQ.,/r/tulsa/comments/tn7l7d/asbury_splits_from_united_methodist_church_over/i22lfj9/,-6,r/tulsa,0,-6

"You understand it right.  If you have a uterus, you can control that uterus.  And no matter what, you can't control other people's uterus.  Or is it peoples' uterii?  I get confused on that part.  The rest of it is pretty clear though.

And yes I'm aware that causing a miscarriage can be a murder case.  That's the thing.  It's murder because you have no right to what's going on in another person's uterus.  Abortion isn't murder because it's done at the request of the uterus owner.  It's a privacy issue.  Private citizens have control over their own bodies.

It's assault if I take one of your kidneys without permission.  It's a medical procedure if you have a kidney removed.  Either way, your losing a kidney.  One way is illegal.  The other is your right.  Because its your kidney.  Does that make sense?  Your kidneys are your kidneys.  Uterus having people have the same autonomy over their uterus.  Because its like their uterus.  Not your uterus.  It's really that simple.  Stop trying to make it about murder.  It's a privacy issue.

"There's a major failure to understand the actual context of the bible.  You don't simply read a book to understand it.  You study when it was written, where it was written, how it was written, why it was written and who wrote it.  And re-wrote it.

It didn't just show up one day in its current form.  The idea that they are protecting the testament by following their own biased interpretation is absurd.  It should be open to question and re-understanding every day.  They're headed towards fundamentalism.  With this split, they are pretty much already there.

And I suppose that's one way to go about religion, but it's kind of messed up and has often lead towards some fairly awful things.  See Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the Shia - Sunni conflicts, or Ayatollah Khomeini.  I believe there are many great things about religion and spirituality, but fundamentalism is a dangerous and destructive path.

It should also be noted that fundamentalism in Christianity is a fairly new idea, only coming into view in the late 1800s during the Niagra Bible Conferences.  Christians haven't been following a strict and literal interpretation of the bible since it's inception.

The HRC has honestly written a clearer and better explanation of the issue than I can.

"The split from UMC is about hiding behind theology so they can discriminate against those they don't understand.  To use Mr. Wilkie's ""slippery slope"" argument...  Next they'll be using the scripture to take away women's rights, minorities rights, etc.

The slippery slope always goes both ways and is based purely on speculation, rendering it moot.  Honestly, I'd much prefer the bigotry of the Westboro Baptists who at least have the courage to own their hatred.  Asbury's positioning hides this hatred behind deceit.

If they truly believed in and understood the scripture they would know that it is the word of God interpreted by man.  They're cherry picking which hills they'd like to die on based on their own bigoted views.  Call me when they stop mixing wool and linen.

I've been a part of this church for the past 33 years and to slowly realize the truth behind their actions is beyond disappointing.

"We shouldn’t really care. No one goes to church anymore. No one knows why, but statistically attendance is a n a race to zero. Old people will church til they die. The kids don’t bother. And regressive bigoted institutional hate will only work to accelerate their demise.

"I’ve worked there 13 years. This is the policy from May 2021:

Updates to CNB’s drug screening policy

Cherokee Nation Businesses has updated its drug screening policy in regard to marijuana usage. The updated policy has been approved and is effective as of May 3, 2021.

The update removes the restriction on marijuana usage for new applicants and current employees who have a valid state-issued medical marijuana license from their state of residence, with the exception of those positions referenced below.

IMPORTANT - Marijuana usage remains prohibited among employees working in safety-sensitive positions. Safety-sensitive positions are defined as any position with job duties that include tasks or duties that CNB believes could affect the safety and health of the employee performing the task or others.

Marijuana usage also remains prohibited among employees in positions that require direct performance on any federal government contract as defined by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 8102).

If you have any questions about whether your position is considered safety-sensitive or is governed by the Drug-Free Workplace Act, contact your supervisor.

The policy also modifies CNB’s random drug screening process. All employees in positions identified, in the company’s sole discretion, as safety-sensitive, may be subject to random drug and/or alcohol use testing.

All employees also are subject to drug screenings issued for reasonable suspicion and for work-related accidents. If an employee tests positive for marijuana on a reasonable suspicion or work-related accident drug screening, they could be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

The possession and use of marijuana while at work or on company property continues to be prohibited for all employees. Any employee in violation could be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

For more information and details, please refer to the updated Substance Abuse and Drug Testing policy.

It is the responsibility of every employee of Cherokee Nation Businesses and its subsidiaries to remain updated on policies and procedures established by the company and the employee’s assigned departmental or functional area.",t2_n1mukan,yerawizardkylieee,0,1648150001.0,0,t1_i1yx6am,i1yx6am,True,Separate_Comment_132,t3_tlgxdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tlgxdp/hard_rock_drug_testing_policy/,Hard Rock drug testing policy,/r/tulsa/comments/tlgxdp/hard_rock_drug_testing_policy/i1yx6am/,1,r/tulsa,0,1

"My friend worked in his foundation for a while and it's honestly a shit show. George kaiser pretty much owns Tulsa. The city is so dependent on him to run clinics, and basic public services. if George kaisers foundation stopped giving the city money or directly running programs for it's citizens, Tulsa would crumble. There is no reason a private citizen should fill gaps to find schools, clinics, parks, and women's resources. It's honestly sad when you look at it objectively, Tulsa as a city has failed to provide for it's citizens adequately.

You are right tho, I know alot of black people who a critical of him because the way he goes about funding things. As well as the fact that black people have a natural inclination to not trust wealthy white citizens doing things out of the goodness of their hearts. and my friend saw first hand how he nuetered a project someone wanted to start to extend services for women in the city, because they MIGHT take federal funding for it and it MAY have brought in the feds to Tulsa in his backyard. Shot it down right then and there, and that guy and his whole team were moved to a completly different project and buried with work. 

 Truthfully, most Tulsans aren't objective because they just see the new services he provides, but if you work on the inside coming from a different city, it's scary how much people have just ceded control to this man. I will say, his foundation is literally the only reason Tulsa is known for anything besides the race massacre, or has any one my age moving to the city at all.

"We all need to calm down. A hundred fifty  years ago Oklahoma was Indian Territory.  Up to 50 to 70 years ago Oklahoma was considered in the southwest. Shucks, it was serviced by cSouthwestern Bell Telephone Company"" (now called ATT because they bought out ATT).  Then the populations started expanding. Just like cities expand into suburbs, the region's changed. I grew up in the 50s & 60s when Oklahoma was considered southwest. I left for 50 years and came back to a state that was considered midwest.  Why, it hasn't moved, but because it is no longer like Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.  Things change. 

Florida is not thought of being a ""southern"" state because most of the people there came from the midwest or north. Midwesterners settled the Florida west coast.  Northerners settled the east coast. Southerners stayed in the south.  In Florida's case it is the 'people' and their mindset.  They have little southern heritage except for the Jacksonville area which I flippantly call ""South Georgia"".

There is no civil war. There is no pro-slavery or anti-slavery.  There are nothing but regional references. Everything in the past dissapeared because of change,  and it always will.

"Oklahoma didn't exist during the American revolution, but Indian Territory did.  And except for a group of Creeks that split off from the main tribe and relocated to Kansas because of it, all of the Five Civilized Tribes allied with the Confederacy and agreed to annexation into the Confederacy.

Given that all of those tribes still exist and given that all of their reservations still exist within the borders of what we now call Oklahoma, I think it's fair to say that Oklahoma, or at least the Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole reservations within it certainly qualify as part of ""the South"" by your definition.",t2_dwhcf,securitysix,0,1648078952.0,0,t1_i1v5bhg,i1v5bhg,False,airbornegeekranger,t3_tkwxya,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tkwxya/ive_had_many_of_arguments_about_this_imho_we_are/,"I’ve had many of arguments about this.

"Oklahoma was not a State at the time that line was drawn.  It was Indian Territory, and was predominantly populated by the Five Civilized Tribes, all of whom practiced slavery (although unlike the others, the Seminole did not start practicing chattel slavery specifically until *after* they were forced to relocate into Indian Territory).

Since the tribes were all sovereign, that line didn't matter to them anyway.

All of the Five Civilized Tribes fought on behalf of the Confederacy and agreed to be annexed by the South (although there was a schism among the Creek over this issue).

The land that was Indian Territory became the land that is now Oklahoma.
