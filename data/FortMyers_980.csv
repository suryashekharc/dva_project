"I wish there were laws preventing people from buying vacation homes no matter where it's at. The air bnb thing isn't a bad thing though since it offers people an alternative to motels/hotels but actually owning a house just for vacation purposes shouldn't be allowed.

Lots of apartment complexes and trailer parks now days are owned by larger corporations that still pretend that each one is independent unless you do some digging online. That's the downside to capitalism, it lets the rich be crooked fucks and wield their wealth to make life harder on those that are not rich.

I've never been rich but there was a time when I made about 260k per year. A little over 10 years ago I went to work for myself and could make a lot of money but I've chosen to live a more enjoyable life which doesn't require having lots of money. My only problem with northerners invading our part of the country would be when they try to change things to be more like where they're from.",t2_q7l447a,southbeatz11,0,1647975358.0,0,t1_i1p35ph,i1p35ph,False,splinterwulf,t3_tjsh20,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/tjsh20/affordable_rent/,Affordable Rent,/r/FortMyers/comments/tjsh20/affordable_rent/i1p35ph/,0,r/FortMyers,0,0
"Sometimes trailer parks where you buy the trailer and pay lot rent can be a good thing. Paying lot rent means no property tax, it usually also means if there's septic problems or water problems outside that the park has to deal with it as well as grass if there's any. Sometimes the lot rent option can be a much easier option. Dealing with a septic system sometimes can cost thousands of dollars.

If the water is well water, that can easily cost $8,000 or more. My sister had to get a well pump replaced and the depth of the well adjusted and it cost her over $8,000. A guy a knew years ago had to spend nearly $10,000 having a new well dug. All those little expenses with owning a house can add up.

Some people don't care about having a yard or a real home so for them apartments are ok. Some people have a lot of money and can easily buy a house in the suburbs but then they have just as many neighbors as they would in a trailer park. Trailers are cheaply built but also cheap to repair and maintain.",t2_q7l447a,southbeatz11,0,1647974928.0,0,t1_i1p21y5,i1p21y5,False,splinterwulf,t3_tjsh20,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/tjsh20/affordable_rent/,Affordable Rent,/r/FortMyers/comments/tjsh20/affordable_rent/i1p21y5/,2,r/FortMyers,0,2
If I had to choose between trailer park or apartment I'd choose trailer park. Apartments always seemed to be like a bunch of rats in boxes living beside each other lol.

"I don't care to be up all night but i did prefer going to Walmart at 1am or 2am just because it wasn't crowded and I could shop more casually without dealing with crowds of people always in my way. Personally, I don't like Walmart but I like spending less money and when Walmart was 24hr it was even better. I know online shopping is pretty common now days but some things I want to get right then and not wait on it plus some things I want to see in person before deciding on if I want to buy it or not.

I know how you feel about stores closing too early though. Before I went to work for myself from home, I worked 7-4 and even then I'd have to go directly to a place if there was anything I needed to do before places closed for the day. It'd be like a big rush after a day at work when I mostly wanted to go home, kick back and eat.

"Malls in some ways are like the old movie rental stores like Blockbuster. They had their time but have lost their appeal to a lot of people. If Malls want to survive then they'd have to seriously step it up and offer more of a reason to go than simply the many highly orver priced stores. There is some good quality things to be found in those over priced stores but that doesn't remove the fact that many of them are still over priced.

Malls also would have to change their business model as in, a lot of clothing stores in malls typically is gear more towards younger people. The younger generation is more likely to prefer online shopping so they need to appeal to the people that used to frequent malls 20 years ago but rarely go anymore today.

As a species, us humans are still social creatures. We like being around other humans but the experience of a mall has greatly lost its appeal especially with social interactions in them being virtually gone aside from speaking to a cashier. Malls that just have stores and nothing else are the malls with less traffic inside them. If they don't attempt to address the corporate greed of just wanting nothing but stores without any real interactions then they will eventually fade away and become office spaces or something.",t2_q7l447a,southbeatz11,0,1647618424.0,0,t1_i15zefp,i15zefp,False,swervage,t3_th0c8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/th0c8s/edison_mall_closing_730_now/,Edison mall closing @ 730 now?,/r/FortMyers/comments/th0c8s/edison_mall_closing_730_now/i15zefp/,2,r/FortMyers,0,2

"Until you consider that the Florida House and Senate [just voted](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/florida-passes-net-metering-bill-that-will-gut-rooftop-solar-advocates-say/620000/) to agreed to FPL's demands to eliminate the solar net metering program in order to monopolize the solar industry in Babcock Ranch, as well as the entire state of Florida by default. (FPL also just built a huge solar farm in Babcock Ranch [in September 2021](https://www.powermag.com/sun-shines-on-fpls-solar-program/).) This hinders the spread of competition.

In 2019, *The New York Times* [also criticized](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/business/energy-environment/florida-solar-power.html) FPL's efforts to limit the expansion of individual solar, saying that ""Florida's utilities keep homeowners from making the most of solar power"".

>The utilities have hindered potential rivals seeking to offer residential solar power. They have spent tens of millions of dollars on lobbying, ad campaigns and political contributions. And when homeowners purchase solar equipment, the utilities have delayed connecting the systems for months.  
>  
>Solar energy is widely considered an essential part of addressing climate change by weaning the electric grid from fossil fuels. California, a clean energy trendsetter, last year became the first state to require solar power for all new homes.  
>  
>But many utilities across the country have fought homeowners’ efforts to install solar panels. The industry’s trade organization, the Edison Electric Institute, has warned that the technology threatens the foundation of the power companies’ business.  
>  
>In Florida, utilities make money on virtually all aspects of the electricity system — producing the power, transmitting it, selling it and delivering it. And critics say the companies have much at stake in preserving that control.  
>  
>“I’ve had electric utility executives say with a straight face that we can’t have solar power in Florida because we have so many cloudy days,” said Representative Kathy Castor, a Democrat from the Tampa area. “I have watched as other states have surpassed us. I think that is largely because of the political influence of the investor-owned utilities.”  
>  
>The state’s utilities have been expanding their own production of solar power. But Florida is one of eight states that prohibit the sale of solar electricity directly to consumers unless the provider is a utility. There is also a state rule, enforced by the utilities, requiring expensive insurance policies for big solar arrays on houses.  
>  
>In 2009, a measure to require a certain amount of energy to be generated from renewable sources passed the State Senate, but died in the House of Representatives when the utilities fought it. Solar proponents have been unable to find legislative traction for similar measures since then.  
>  
>Mayor Rick Kriseman of St. Petersburg — the site of Duke Energy’s Florida headquarters — has argued for changing the way utilities are regulated so they would embrace more energy efficiency, residential solar power and energy storage. The companies essentially see the solar-equipped homeowner as a competitor, not a customer, he said.  
>  
>\[...\] From 2014 through the end of May, Florida’s four largest investor-owned utilities together spent more than $57 million on campaign contributions, according to an analysis by Integrity Florida, a nonprofit research organization, and the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group. **FPL, the state’s largest utility, accounted for $31 million of that total.**  
>  
>The utilities also hired enough lobbyists to have one for every two lawmakers in Tallahassee. From 2014 through 2017, the four companies spent $6 million on lobbying, Integrity Florida reported.  
>  
>But solar advocates, rather than the utilities, have been the primary drivers for change at the consumer level.  
>  
>An unlikely grass-roots coalition has emerged in Florida in the last five years to promote solar power — residential in particular — as environmentalists from the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and the Sierra Club joined with groups like the Tea Party and the Christian Coalition.  
>  
>While the groups’ rationales for joining the effort varied from environmental protection to a libertarian view of energy freedom, the issue united them against the utilities, which backed a ballot measure in 2016 to impose more fees on solar users and keep solar companies other than utilities out of the state.  
>  
>Although the utilities spent more than $20 million on the campaign, the measure was defeated. And the next year, the grass-roots effort persuaded lawmakers to exempt up to 80 percent of the value of solar installations from property taxes. It seemed a great victory for consumers — but the utilities also benefited, because it eased their tax burden on dozens or even hundreds of acres of solar farms.  
>  
>“I would say that none of Florida’s utilities are enthusiastic about their customers’ deploying solar,” said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “I am not surprised at the horror stories.”  
>  
>FPL points to its role in a particular bet on a solar future: Babcock Ranch, developed near Fort Myers by a company that extols it as the nation’s first sustainable town. **The power company built a solar farm that largely supplies the town’s energy needs.**  
>  
>FPL announced four similarly sized projects in April, and **Duke says it is also building farms that size.**  
>  
>“FPL has been working for many years to advance solar energy while keeping customer bills low,” said Mark Bubriski, a company spokesman. The utility said it plans to add enough solar capacity to power about 1.5 million homes and provide 20 percent of its total generation by 2030.",t2_k11a2,Obversa,0,1647232710.0,0,t1_i0kx8ya,i0kx8ya,False,Ok_Sympathy6955,t3_tdmmxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/tdmmxn/considering_moving_to_fort_myers/,Considering moving to Fort Myers,/r/FortMyers/comments/tdmmxn/considering_moving_to_fort_myers/i0kx8ya/,4,r/FortMyers,0,4

"Don’t overlook the higher and increasing costs of homeowners insurance. Many companies are canceling policies because of the litigation expenses. Most people I know have had to get new policies at increased expense. Couple that with a coastal location, you’d be shocked. Like $3,000 a year minimum. For a plain Jane $200,000 house. 

So then you have to likely add in Flood Insurance, which is notoriously high lately. Someone else can correct, at least $1,000 a year, unless you find a house not in a flood plain. 

Real estate taxes. The folks in Babcock Ranch paying cash are shooketh when their tax bill jumps up to $5,000/year. These are new builds. 

RE Taxes on resales. Florida has “Save Our Homes” statutes. When you buy a house, your tax assessment can’t increase more than 3% a year. This protects our elderly on fixed incomes. However once a house is sold, the assessment goes back to full market value. In this white hot housing market, taxes could jump another $5,000 in your second year of ownership. 

Not trying to discourage you, just a heads up in these crazy times. 

But there’s no state income tax and no personal property tax (car sticker). 

As others have said, look in the east county markets. Or further, like LaBelle. Or North Fort Myers. Prices are lower and lots are larger.

Wood frame homes are less desirable.

Older roof can be uninsurable and maybe the seller cannot afford a new roof.

Flood insurance prices in general

Poor condition

"3 factors: Size, Speed, Nationality
Firstly, Cape Coral is one of the largest cities in the US by land mass. In FL it's second only to Jacksonville, but with a population of 200,000. This means that what you think of as the South Eastern Cape, which looks like a typical city, is actually just the iceberg tip. Lots of houses are spread out and in NW Cape, there's houses that require a sewer hook up that hasn't been completed yet.

Next, is speed. Cape Coral demographically is one of the fastest growing cities in the US. Prepandemic, it was second to Las Vegas in percentage growth. As such, there are TONS of new building starts. New homes and homes under construction tend to move very fast, while some older homes get passed over by people because it's cheaper to buy new than buy old and remodel.

Last is nationality. Cape Coral is the place in SWFL where Germans and other European buyers tend to buy second homes. They rent them out or use them for vacations. This means some sellers are listing so they get offers, but are not actually motivated to sell, and other factors like seasonal travel, foreign taxes and exchange rates can also govern sales of homes.",t2_7xmm2408,GreatGoatsInHistory,0,1647171242.0,0,t1_i0hcucz,i0hcucz,True,HerrowPries,t3_tczal4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/tczal4/need_outside_opinion_on_cape_coral_why_are_so/,Need outside opinion on Cape Coral.

Cape Coral has 100s of building permits being issued. They can’t process them fast enough. Sales of homes in Naples Bonita and Ft myers tend to go much quicker as they r highly sought after areas. The Cape has beautiful homes and canals but no beaches except a few on the Calossahatchie river. Homes on the canals can run into the million dollar range depending on size but from 5000 ft the Cape is a huge patchwork of neighborhoods with a lot of open land thus is being built at a rate ppl aren’t buying as quick. No real supply to meet demand in 3 areas above mentioned and prices up 120% in 2 years so eventually the Cape will sell just as quick.,t2_knfl2h87,Hockeyobh,0,1647149862.0,0,t1_i0glp5e,i0glp5e,True,HerrowPries,t3_tczal4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/tczal4/need_outside_opinion_on_cape_coral_why_are_so/,Need outside opinion on Cape Coral.

"Bell Tower Shops and the Edison Mall were both great when I was a kid, especially with toy and other cool stores. (I was born in Cape Coral in 1991, and was raised in Fort Myers throughout the 1990s and 2000s.) However, now, both Bell Tower and Edison Mall seem like shadows of their former selves. Edison Mall now has a reputation for being ""ghetto"", and Bell Tower is a ghost town.

I think that the opening, and expansion, of Gulf Coast Town Center in 2005-2007 caused people who previously shopped at Bell Tower to simply shop at Gulf Coast instead. The opening of a new Regal Cinemas IMAX location at Gulf Coast also took business away from Bell Tower's Regal Cinemas.

As an edit, I also forgot that Coconut Point opened as a ""newer Bell Tower"" in 2006 as well. Everything that Bell Tower was - upscale outdoor mall - was expanded upon in Coconut Point. Meanwhile, Bell Tower Shops, which had opened in 1982, was starting to show its age by then.

Also see the 2008 paper [""Bell Tower Shops: The Impact of New Competition in a Niche Market""](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/35713/Ardeshna_The%20Impact%20of%20New%20Competetition%20in%20a%20Niche%20Market_2008_Sislen.pdf). When the paper was released, Bell Tower Shops was at 96% occupancy. Now, not so much.

>""Despite the dramatic success of the center over the last several years, since the beginning of 2007, the Property has been impacted by two competing developments: Coconut Point, developed by Simon Property Group and Gulf Coast Town Center, developed by Richard Jacobs.   
>  
>The projects, which came on-line simultaneously at the end of 2006, total approximately 3 million square feet of retail and are within a 9-mile drive east (Gulf Coast) and south (Coconut Point) of the Property.   
>  
>It was originally thought that both projects would not get built and not be considered direct competition to Bell Tower for varying reasons including merchandising mix and distance from the center. However, the County approved both projects, and Coconut Point has proven to be more competitive than originally anticipated having eroded some of the purchasing power at Bell Tower.   
>  
>Overall, total tenants sales at Bell Tower are down almost 7.5% and duplicative tenants sales (between Coconut Point and Bell Tower) are down 17% YTD. One of the Property’s restaurant tenants unexpectedly vacated over the summer as well, due to a sudden sales decrease.   
>  
>The deterioration in financials for the Property can also be seen when looking at the expected Net Operating Income for 2008 versus what is forecasted for 2007, due to the impact on overage rent generated.   
>  
>The 2007 budgeted NOI was slightly re-forecasted from $6.6 million to $6.5 million after the decline in tenant sales was better determined, thus causing a revision in the overage rent estimate. The 2008 NOI is now expected to be approximately $6 million, which is a decrease of $500,000, almost 8% lower, compared to the 2007-forecasted NOI.   
>

"The Sydney and Berne Davis Art Center in Downtown Fort Myers has a lot of cool programs, sometimes they do open mics and poetry. You might find people your vibe there. 

If you haven't already, follow Gulf Coast Leisure on Facebook. They do open mic poetry nights and are doing some great things down here. In fact, they're doing a poetry and art event on March 24th at the Sydney & Berne. 

Across the street from Sydney & Berne is a Kava bar and they do open mic nights regularly. That's a pretty cool crowd too. 

I've also seen poetry at the Alliance for the Arts, so maybe check them out.

You seem to bring a lot of your beliefs back to things you've personally experienced. This isn't always a bad thing, but it can definitely close yourself off to some realities of the world. I can easily say I've seen kids hating each other based on race here in SWFL because I lived it.

The whataboutism that ""racism happens everywhere"" doesn't negate the fact that it had real-world effects for generations of families in America. Same thing with the homeless. Even though there's probably some homeless people who are simply lazy, that doesn't mean that every beggar you see is lazy and/or came here from some big city to ""make money.""

Again, mental illness is extremely complicated and earlier you said something like ""I can tell who is mentally ill and who isn't,"" implying that your knowledge of the world is the end all be all.

>  
>Source: There have been some reports by local and national media about bus ticket programs for the homeless.  
>

>  
>But service providers in Tulsa and Oklahoma City say the idea that other cities are sending homeless people to Oklahoma in large numbers is a myth.

And the small number of people who came from out of state didn’t necessarily arrive through another city’s homeless relocation program.

Source: [The Frontier](https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/we-fact-checked-social-media-claims-and-urban-myths-about-homelessness-in-oklahoma/)\*

This myth has persisted since 2001, [according to Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/2001/10/31/19614236/busing-homeless-just-myth), and [this article](https://mynorthwest.com/1415605/seattle-homeless-bus-ticket-conspiracy/) by MYNorthwest also debunks this myth more in-depth.

Additionally, where bus programs do exist, there are [requirements in place](https://www.westword.com/news/denver-buses-homeless-to-other-cities-but-its-not-nearly-as-nefarious-as-it-sounds-9920772):

>""A key aspect of the Family Reunification Program is that bus-ticket recipients must prove that they have family or a support group waiting for them at their destination.  
>  
>When applying — at Denver Human Services locations or through the Denver Street Outreach Collaborative — prospective bus-riders provide contact information for their support person(s), and a DHS caseworker then vets the provided contact to ensure that the person bused out of Denver will be housed and supported.  
>  
>The program will only provide one one-way bus ticket to an applicant. That way, it avoids becoming a subsidized, back-and-forth travel service.""

This is also evidenced in *The Guardian*'s [18-month investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study):

>\[One homeless man\] had been feeling sick, tired and depressed in San Francisco, and after three years living on the streets he decided to take his chances in Indianapolis, where he grew up. An old friend had offered him a living room to sleep in and told him there was a possibility of a job as a dishwasher at a nearby fine-dining fish restaurant.  
>  
>“I’m just going to go back and work,” he said, and “save money, and just live.""  
>  
>Some of these journeys provide a route out of homelessness, and many recipients of free tickets said they are grateful for the opportunity for a fresh start. Returning to places they previously lived, many rediscover old support networks, finding a safe place to sleep, caring friends or family, and the stepping stones that lead, eventually, to their own home.

What does that have to do with anything? I'd point out that the News-Press reported in 2020 and 2021 that a lot of the homeless problem was due to people losing their jobs, careers, and/or homes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of currently, it seems the homelessness problem is being exacerbated by ballooning rent and/or home prices, including jacking up rents to a point where lower-income people are literally priced out of their own homes. There's also no rent control to ensure affordable housing.

It doesn't matter what happened in 2018 or not. These are problems that can't be ignored, as homelessness is a major warning sign of other underlying problems that must be addressed.

"Cape Coral technically shouldn't even exist. Its sole purpose is literally to provide housing for all of the people who commute to Fort Myers every day for work.

I live right next to the Midpoint Bridge, and every morning, there's always an increasingly bad commuter traffic jam there. More growth will eventually mean having to add another bridge for more lanes in order to lessen all of the traffic onto Colonial - which means encroaching even further into the neighborhoods and businesses surrounding the bridge. This obviously poses a massive problem for Fort Myers.

Case in point, a new bridge [started to be discussed in November 2020](https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/fort-myers/2020/11/19/lee-county-seeks-solutions-traffic-jams-colonial-and-summerlin-fort-myers/6322767002/), but nothing has been seriously debated, or even implemented, as of 2022 - almost 2 years later.

"The issue is that Long Island - plus NYC, Boston, etc. - can ""build up"" (i.e. skyscrapers) due to the studier, denser, more compact soil and ground in the Northeast. Florida cannot ""build up"" past certain height(s) due to having weaker soil, which limits the ""evolution of city growth here"", and is a major contributor to the problem of urban sprawl (i.e. expanding out instead of up).

Lower costs and lack of regulations are also issues in Florida that we don't see in the Northeast, which has much more well-regulated construction and building. This causes large problems for Florida when it comes to the lack of urban planning, as well as developers looking to build ""as cheaply as possible"", which has led to more corner-cutting. The [Surfside condominium collapse in 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfside_condominium_collapse) also demonstrated that Florida needs tighter building regulations going forwards.

Florida also has a much higher water table than the Northeast does, which largely prevents Florida from building the Subway and Metro systems we see in NYC and Washington, D.C. This, coupled with the reluctance to invest in public transportation systems (i.e. trains, buses, cycling) and urban planning in favor of ""car culture"", makes SWFL a much different case than the NE.",t2_k11a2,Obversa,0,1646439575.0,0,t1_hzdzr9c,hzdzr9c,False,9e11even,t3_t6og9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/t6og9h/is_this_really_sustainable/,Is This Really Sustainable?,/r/FortMyers/comments/t6og9h/is_this_really_sustainable/hzdzr9c/,2,r/FortMyers,0,2
">A lot of these people are 25-40 and able-bodied.

I would point out that a study done of Orlando panhandlers [by the Orlando Sentinel](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/editorials/os-op-downtown-orlando-panhandling-study-findings-20200109-a4c7bzka3ra7vnroqdljb7dpem-story.html) showed that many had a physical and/or mental disability that impacted their ability to work. The solution suggested was building or implementing low-income public housing or shelter, as well as providing them with subsidized therapy and treatment(s) for mental health problems. Substance abuse addiction (i.e. opioids, alcohol, heroin, etc...) was also a major problem.

From the article:

>""Many of the chronic panhandlers reported using the money they make — an average of $63 a day — to support their addictions. About 60% of the group said panhandling was their sole source of income.  
>  
>\[...\] Perhaps the most surprising — and potentially hopeful — finding is that the number of chronic panhandlers in downtown Orlando is only about 60. While many of the hundreds of other homeless people who wander downtown will occasionally ask passersby for cash, the group that does it on a persistent and daily basis is relatively small, according to the study.  
>  
>That suggests the problem may be more manageable than it appears. If just a few dozen people make up the cohort of chronic panhandlers, the type of assistance programs recommended in the study — aimed specifically at finding them shelter and assistance with substance abuse and mental health problems — seem less pie-in-the-sky.""

$63 a day roughly translates to working at a rate of $9 an hour for 7 hours, with a weekly income of $441; a monthly income of \~$1,950; and a yearly income of $23,400. That's comparable to working a full-time minimum wage job, and is just $1 an hour less than Florida's new minimum wage ($10 an hour). However, the panhandlers with mental health and/or disability issues seem unsuited for some job tasks, and/or need accommodations.

For reference, a yearly income of $23,400 is still below the federal poverty line ($25,465), including panhandlers and/or homeless families with two or more children.

>""In 2018, the federal poverty income threshold was $25,465 for a family of four with two children, and $17,308 for a single parent of one child. If a family's total income is less than the corresponding threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty."" - [Florida Poverty Statistics](https://www.livestories.com/statistics/florida/poverty)

Panhandlers/homeless people are easier to help financially rehabilitate if they are single parents, or single with no children, but there are several issues to overcome there:

1. Providing shelter or low-income and/or subsidized housing; i.e. like a hotel room or hostel where they can stay safely, sleep, shower, and clean themselves up.
2. Providing free and/or subsidized food (i.e. food stamps), especially for the disabled.
3. Providing programs to provide free or low-cost clothing (i.e. Goodwill, Dress for Success), and free training on interviewing and applying for jobs.
4. Providing a reliable means of transportation (i.e. public and/or program-based).
5. Providing free and/or subsidized medical care (i.e. mental health/addiction treatment).

Unfortunately, the Fort Myers city council doesn't seem to want to build low-income public homes or shelters, and/or subsidized therapy and treatment(s), in order to help mitigate the increasing homelessness that we have in Lee County/Fort Myers. Instead, they tore up Centennial Park for ""business purposes"" (i.e. leasing it to the privately-owned Luminary Hotel) and made it as ""homeless-unfriendly"" as possible, without actually fixing the issue.",t2_k11a2,Obversa,0,1646438422.0,0,t1_hzdx3a4,hzdx3a4,False,9e11even,t3_t6og9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/t6og9h/is_this_really_sustainable/,Is This Really Sustainable?,/r/FortMyers/comments/t6og9h/is_this_really_sustainable/hzdx3a4/,5,r/FortMyers,0,5

"It's not sustainable now and it's going to get much worse. I've seen more accidents the last 6 months than I have in years. At least once a week I see an ambulance or fire truck rushing to somewhere. Before that was rare. Just yesterday I saw a scammer musician in the parking lot of Walmart on College parkway. He walked from his $60,000 car to set up a sign to say that he was a local Floridian desperate for food. He had a guitar to play music. His license plate was from Oklahoma and the car wasn't a rental. 

What we need to do on this subreddit and other local subreddits is to discourage anyone else to come move here. r/Florida has been doing that for 2 years now. We don't need more people here. The city and county aren't going to keep up with the increase in population. We will just get more crime and more homeless people. Many people come down to Florida trying to start a new life.

"No, and especially not while the city council and county commissioners are all pro-development, often with heavy personal, career, and financial ties to development and real estate. Most have a vested interest in ""promoting the economy"" by ""ensuring as much development as possible"", protecting their own interests while ignoring the issues that arise with both a lack of (sub)urban planning, and/or haphazard planning, and uncontained (sub)urban sprawl. In almost all cases, the city council has also ignored or overridden locals' complaints in order to ""promote development"".

In most cases, this specifically means allowing unchecked and de-regulated private development-for-profit, sometimes at the expense of the Fort Myers populace, residents, and locals at-large.

Examples of this include approved development(s) to Downtown Fort Myers when it comes to high-rises, the Luminary Hotel, and other projects; proposed development(s) to the Lee County Civic Center; and proposed development(s) to the Buckingham Preserve area, the latter two of which are located in rural areas that face increasing encroachment from development, expansion, and sprawl.

I have a degree, I have decades of experience and it's comical/depressing for me to ever look for work here. Employers pay so low and expect the world from their employees, but are like 15 years behind. I left and was in NYC, Miami, and California before finally ending up back here and it's a fine place to raise my daughter, but I can only afford to pay my bills by keeping my clients and work based in NYC.  The political climate here is rather polarizing, I dread election years here and still am haunted by a boss I had when Obama was elected and the staff meeting where he dropped the N-word. I could go on and on and on with that. I wanted to start a Twitter back in the day with just the mindblowing stuff I heard my boss's say here. Other than that, there's literally no culture, nothing to do, but leave lol, no good shopping, But it is what it is, right? I get by because my salary comes from NYC and Miami, we leave most weekends, and I order everything online, so it's a fine home base i guess.

"Also, it is currently 17 degrees outside. It is also sunny which is a very welcome change. But… that just leads to there being black ice everywhere right now. Spinny spins for you and for you and for you too! 

As far as culture goes, get a subscription to the New York Times. That’s your daily driver. Go to a show once a month in Tampa or similar. How much culture does one need every day? We love going to the theatre and other live events but we certainly don’t need to live in the same town to enjoy them. 

Yes, I will admit to there being a ton of loud politically minded folks all over Fort Myers. They’re at the pool. They’re at the beach. They’re at the grocery store. They’re most definitely at the restaurants. Thing is, I can ignore them. I honestly enjoy getting to watch a skit on the Daily Show come to life to see that there are in fact people with wildly different worldviews than me. It’s a great reminder of the world I want to create versus the world that actually exists. Doesn’t really bother me.

Don’t worry, we are coming down on Saturday for a few weeks and to celebrate being warm. Can’t wait!

"I guess it depends what else you know. I lived close to the Canadian border, in a small town, small state for over 20 years. That town fought for 20 years just to get a Walmart and when they did, it wasn’t allowed to sell produce, and the tax rate for the town went up. No shopping, truly minimal food options, not even a Chick-fil-A in the entire state. The state finally got 1 single Target…a “boutique” sized store that was opened as a store front attached to a mall. 1 Costco in the entire state. And that Costco is not able to even sell gas for certain hours of the day due to competing with local gas stations that gouged us for years (it’s true, there was a settlement on it). 

Once you enter the work force and start making decent money and you notice the state income tax line, and pay several thousands of dollars to a state that you don’t enjoy - that hurts. And you look around and wonder where the money goes because the roads are filled with frost heaves and giant potholes leading to wear and tear on your vehicle. 

Not to mention weather. Once you have a job, and it’s a 30 mile commute because there are few jobs, in the winter you will shovel your driveway the night before you go to bed, then you wake up and it’s like you never shoveled. Before you can leave your driveway you are shoveling, warming up your car, scraping off snow and ice. Then you drive on icy or snow covered roads. Winter is brutal. Driving through snow storms and you can’t even see, your wipers are frozen over and won’t clear your windshield. You are changing and rotating tires frequently, and the weather is tough on vehicles. Heat is on in your home from October-June. Have to maintain cycles of clothes and shoes to keep up with constant changes in weather. There was sun maybe 30% of the year. It was depressing. 

Amongst many, many other reasons of why I don’t love the North! Haha, sorry to change it, but it’s the only way to explain what and why I love it here. I could have moved and enjoyed other states I’m sure, but I compare this area to what I know. So I love this area because it offers me freedom, convenience, choice, options, the ability to enjoy outside just about every single day. There is life all year, and even being able to hear the sounds of the tropical birds all year is something. Being able to just get in my vehicle and leave my home without winter weather issues is something some people have no idea about. I maintain the same wardrobe all year, with just a few long sleeves and jackets, you can get away with wearing sandals every day. Try having to wear clunky boots then bring a change of shoes everywhere you go. I get to ride my golf cart around my community everyday and it was finally reasonable to get a vehicle where I can put the top back. It’s driving distance to many other great locations. Even though the building seems out of control, they are business friendly too. 

The drivers and the entitled elderly are definite problems I recognize, but I don’t think you could pay me enough to move back North.",t2_aq4n0kzg,CeeInSoFLo,0,1646256462.0,0,t1_hz3obxs,hz3obxs,True,HaMay25,t3_t55x6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/t55x6q/what_do_you_love_about_fort_myersswfl_i/,What do you love about Fort Myers/SWFL?

"A lot of people live here to enjoy the water. Sooo many boats here. There are so many things you can do on the water here like boating, fishing, kayaking, paddleboarding, windsurfing, kitesurfing and more.

Personally I just enjoy exploring, the SWFL coast is very interesting and sometimes I'll just find somewhere interesting on Google Earth just go check it out. 

Most of the beaches here are really fun to explore. Instead of just going to a beach and finding a place to plop down and sit and do nothing I'll go walk far down them. Bunche Beach is a really cool one, but mainly during low tide. On a good low tide you can walk out a few hundred feet and still be ankle deep.
I'm not crazy into fishing but this is definitely a great place to do that. 

I guess I just feel like I can go out and do a lot here. I come from a place that really offered almost nothing to do.

While there is quite a lot of old people I feel like most  that I've encountered aren't that bad. There are some that suck but I just don't let them bother me and just ignore their existence entirely.

As for food, I believe most places have great food but sometimes you just have to dig a little bit deeper.

It can get crowded especially from January to April-May but it calms down in the summer.

You just have to find some something you like to do and people that you like that also like to do what you do. Every places has its positives and negatives, there isn't a perfect place to live wherever you go.

I could give you a list of cool places to explore and other things I've done if you'd like.",t2_gvc44i3q,davydude1,0,1646254710.0,0,t1_hz3k208,hz3k208,True,HaMay25,t3_t55x6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/t55x6q/what_do_you_love_about_fort_myersswfl_i/,What do you love about Fort Myers/SWFL?

"The food in the fort myers/cape coral/punta gorda area has been amazing. I guess you just have to know where to go, although i didnt have a hard time finind any so long as your open to trying different things. Laotian, indian, thai, hispanic, italian, and southern cooking just to name a few. Name most cuisines and there is a pretty decent/authentic spot.

Also, the boating down here is amazing and cruising to the different barrier islands and fishing can open a whole new world of activities for someone who hasnt done it. The beaches around some of the barrier islands are breathtaking, escecially when a boat is required to get there, as the people are usually limited. Also diving and spearfishing can be pretty fun and there are places all around to get certified. Go rent a boat for a day and see!

There is also a pretty huge outdoor trail/ nature/ hunting scene all around us. Cape coral has the state owned Yucca Pens Wma for bike riding and nature viewing while punta gorda and north fort myers have Babcock Webb WMA. Litterally tens of thousands of acres for jogging, biking, fishing, hunting, and you name it.

I feel like this location is what you make it. There are a load of fun things to do if you are into the lifestyles that this location offers.
